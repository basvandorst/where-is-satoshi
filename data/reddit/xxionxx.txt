Because buying some more bitcoin when you spend some is hard? 
Spending bitcoin is a joy, if it was more stable I'd sink more money into it. Not spending bitcoin is counterproductive. You don't have to spend any more than you normally do. Just do things like buy Amazon gift cards from Gyft or pay for your website's domain name on namecheap. 
Why are you acting like replacing the bitcoin you spend is impossible? 
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:55:34
Because gigantic telcos forcing you to pay billions for your traffic and micropayments for fractions of a penny are identical right? 
You are equating digital movies bought/streamed on Amazon to a violation of the freedom of speech. 
Net neutrality makes sure that you can buy the movie from Amazon and not have to pay racketeering fees to the telcos to get it to your house. It doesn't mean that you are forcing people to serve you digital goods for free.

I really don't know how to put this nicely but others should know; a Windows computer which you are using daily isn't secure, it isn't even secure if you have 8 anti virus firewall Windows defender superbots. It doesn't matter if you run the most secure Linux distribution. **If you are using the computer daily, you need to use a paper wallet with a live cd or external wallet like a Trezor. Period.**
**Edit**:I would like to add that if you are unsure of security, you will be far better off trusting a third party like Coinbase. Just enable 2 factor security and have decent passwords on your account and email. 
Personally I would rather take control of my own security because using a live CD isn't complex, and neither is a Trezor.

Make sure to make multiple copies of the wallet even if you don't use BIP38, multisig wallets are also cool. If you have your house burn down and you have one of your wallet copies in a safety deposit box you can recover all of your funds. Try doing that with gold or fiat! Consider breaking up your funds into multiple wallets too, something about all your eggs in one basket :p
And don't forget to keep some in a hot wallet to spend! Bitcoins are a joy to use and feeling comfortable using them is important if you are investing in them. You don't even have to spend your stash, you can just buy more as you use them to replace the ones you spend. 
As for hot wallets I personally recommend Mycelium, it kicks ass. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:49:35
I have the bulk of my coins in a paper wallet. (Multiple copies of the same wallet in several places. I should really add bip38...) But I like the idea that I can keep an online backup and not have to worry about it. I think I'll probably split it up because something about eggs and a basket.

Good job investing in something risky responsibility. I am glad you aren't another person investing everything they own.
Maybe you should buy more in small amounts when you are comfortable though. I think Coinbase has a feature which will allow you to do that automatically. If you are buying for the long term, more is better right? I don't know how old you are but if you are young, you can take on more risk and recover if your venture fails.

If you are nervous about the transaction, do smaller amounts first. That way you can get a feel for the person selling you bitcoins, and if you get scammed it's only a small amount. Use escrow for increased security.

Sure you can, just swipe it right here in my card reader which is definitely not stealing your pin and magstripe info. /s
I get what you are saying but that isn't the point people are making about paper wallets being bank vaults for your bitcoins, or using Trezors as a happy medium between both types of wallets. People are only saying that you can choose to be as secure, or insecure, as you desire. This is not so of Credit cards. 
Credit cards have billions of dollars of fraudulent transactions each year, and you as a user, are powerless to stop a majority of those thefts. Bitcoin can help you secure not only your finances, but you can also [digitally sign legal documents]( Which you can use to prove your identity, proof of ownership (deeds), or any other document you desire.
Literally none of this is ready for primetime yet. We don't even have FDIC insured bitcoin accounts yet. So all of this is just speculation anyway.
My personal fascination with bitcoin resides in the fact that a 5 year old currency can run circles around traditional payment methods, document verification methods, and identity theft prevention methods.

\ you don't understand pgp keys. For a communication to be valid the old key must sign the new one. Period. 
The new key signed the old one. If _you_ wanted to make a key and sign Satoshi's key you could easily do that.
No sig from the old key, not Satoshi. 
\ Occams razor? You are falsely applying it. There are at least a half dozen points where an attacker could have attacked that account if they were skilled enough. This is why you use PGP keys, see 
Occams razor simply says that the more simple explanation tends to be true.
So your choices are:
* Satoshi, an amazing hacker who loves privacy and understands crypto, higher mathematics, and internet security. Forgot how to use PGP keys, didn't sign his key correctly, and came back from the dead just to deliver this message which would only harm him and Dorian.
* Someone attacked any number of vectors on an insignificant website with mild security at best. He could have had the strongest password in the world and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference if the surrounding architecture was compromised. This is why we use PGP keys, see 
Personally, until they key is signed correctly I will just keep thinking that Satoshi never said shit.
**Edit**: I realize you seem think that you can only compromise a website account by first compromising an email account. I can assure you that this is untrue. Satoshi's email could be tight as a drum and the account could be compromised. Again, see

Make small purchases of bitcoin at first, their anti-fraud algorithm doesn't like it when newly registered users buy the maximum amount of bitcoin allowed. 
Some people get all bent out of shape because they are a proper US bank which reports their transactions, this is just like exchanging you dollars for euros. If you want to make your bitcoins anonymous again just send a small portion through a mixer and then keep it to yourself. Don't try and bring your "dirty" bitcoins back to Coinbase and sell them though, you might get banned from using their service. I haven't heard of this happening yet but it pays to understand the dangers of mixers. 
**Edit**: And learn how to use a paper wallet, you will sleep like a baby when you hear that someone hacked something.

I also don't think this is _that_ much different than a paper wallet. I am savvy enough to help them out with their phones and such.
I also don't like the branding on the outside, this is a big deal. Why do you think Mac products are so slick? Cool things sell.
Basically all of the reasons above VS an unproven hardware wallet which is currently vaporware. Nah, I'll just wait for another project.

This is a great question but I think we are a little early in the adoption of bitcoin to give you a simple solution :(
As others have mentioned, there are lots of potential solutions in the works but I can't think of any which would work right now. Of course the holy grail is a debit card service which converts to bitcoin right away for the customer but that is a ways off.
Less of a solution and more of an idea: You could have a promotion where your customers could get like 30%-50% off of their first purchase in bitcoin. You might take a loss but it would definitely encourage your customers to try and figure it out! I pulled those numbers out of the air but you get the idea. Who doesn't like free money?
It is your business but personally I would be careful if you are dealing with large amounts. Not because you could lose a lot but because your aforementioned technically inclined customers might flee or lose a lot of money by accident and become upset.
Bitcoin is safe for those who understand internet safety. Not so much for the people who people who have passwords like "mydogsname12345". Even self proclaimed tech geeks are realizing they weren't as safe as they thought they were.

You are just committing a message to the blockchain. Similar to how you send a transaction to the blockchain and the blockchain keeps a record of it. They are simply using [the message functions of bitcoin](
Each message is kept in the blockchain forever or until they decide on a pruning option. This allows you to create contracts and form official documents without a central authority.
Like so


Or pretty much anything else you can think of. This is a really basic explanation and I might have even gotten some of the finer points wrong but that is what devs are working on.
**TLDR**: Bitcoin isn't just a currency, it is a distributed ledger which can include things like contacts, IPOs, and incorporations.

When they are too lazy to use a live CD and download bitaddress.org to print out a wallet? Yeah, I think buying a $200 printer to protect a few thousand dollars of your investment is a good idea.
But hey, there is always the $1 CD and free download. I know it will take perhaps an hour or two of your time because burning a CD is so hard and waiting for the OS to download bitaddress.org is painful like fireants on your genitals but I think it might be worth the effort considereing that the Piper Wallet printer is $200.
I'm not saying that this is a "solution for the masses and grandma". But if you are investing in a ~~beta version~~ currency which has not even reached a full 1.0 version, then you should take proper precautions to protect yourself. Bitcoin is risky, I have never seen anyone say that it is a sure bet (Except maybe some extreme bulls who need their heads checked). If it's risky then you should probably fasten your seatbelt like the rest of us (obligatory TO DA MOON!).
Until I can buy a trezor down at Walmart for $10, I will be using my live CD and bitaddress.org paper wallets.
**TLDR**: No, I don't expect *anyone* to buy a $200 printer. That is absurd and you know it.
**Edit**: Made some changes for clarification.

Bitcoin may not be the undisputed king of crypto but nothing will be stopping bitcoin's rise anytime soon. If you don't understand why people are saying this, you don't understand bitcoin.

What people are trying to say is that you don't suspect dollars of being fraudulent if they are stolen. Dollars, gold, and iPhones are all assets which are difficult to counterfeit at best. Bitcoin is not at fault for being stolen any more than a pen is at fault for you getting an F on your term paper. (Please let us know if you figure out to to break the blockchain. We would all be *very* interested.)
You can insure dollars as you have pointed out, and Circle will insure your bitcoins [so long as you take proper responsibility for your passwords, 2FA, etc.]( And even then it's only $100. This could change in the future.
But if you are afraid of holding assets without insurance then bitcoin is not for you right now.
Personally I use a combo of paper wallets, phone wallets, and electrum seeds. I treat withdrawing btc from my paper wallets like going to the bank to get cash. I don't want to carry too much in case something bad happens.

Bitcoin doesn't need you to use it. Bitcoin is a honey badger, it doesn't give a fuck. 
Seriously, if you don't care to use it, don't. Bitcoin is a tool, good tools stick around for years while bad tools fade away. Time will tell us if bitcoin is the future of cryptocurrency. 
The decentralized blockchain is a revolutionary achievement on par with the Internet. The blockchain is here to stay. Bitcoin? Only time will tell. 
Why do you need to use bitcoin? You don't. Just like you don't need a car, bank account, or television. Those things are convenient but unnecessary. 
Every day people said the same thing about the steam engine, Internet shopping, email, cars, electricity, and a thousand other inventions. 
Am I saying bitcoin is the future? No, I am simply stating that your personal criteria for "the every day Joe" is a useless metric. 
When we look back at history, the public is crazy, not the innovators and inventors. The few people who stopped and installed the first telephone in their house could only call an extremely small number of people. Do you think that the public cared about their purchase? 
You state that the masses don't need or want bitcoin, what is your basis for that claim? Too complex? So was the Internet. They already have bank accounts? They already had horses who needs a car? Etc. 
Bitcoin has already proven itself as a tool, we are just waiting to see if will stick around for a while.

... I have no idea what you are on about. It's just an insurance company. If you need risky capital, I am sure someone will want a return. 
As for the idea that you need to fight the government, no. I just said that I don't believe it is illegal to replace things confiscated by the government. If it is, then I am mistaken. 
If it's legal and people are willing to front capital, why not? 
I would leave it up to the insured to decide *when* they wanted their funds back. If they are confiscated a second time, that is not the company's problem. 
There are high risk insurance companies for just about everything. Why not this?

Because, to me, this is a huge sticking point. I care less about Dorian and more about if the message was actually from Satoshi. I care about Dorian as a human but he is irrelevant to bitcoin unless he is actually Satoshi. And like you say, a sig will not prove either way if he is Satoshi so I feel this is irrelevant.
The whole Dorian thing was a non-issue to me until the supposed message. That was the only point where I actually wanted to know what was going on. I thought Satoshi was never going to come back. And I reeeeeally want to know if it was Satoshi but no sig so meh.
The whole argument about whether it was a real message hinges on the sig to me. I could care less unless it is signed properly. I wanted to know if Satoshi was going to speak again, I don't care if he is Dorian or not.

It would be trivial to loan someone bitcoin. But unless they had a way to pay those bitcoins back even if they suddenly went to $10k+ the risk of such a loan would be sky high. 
But this is why there are bitcoin loans on Bitfinex, so you can make a killing if it goes down(shorting). You can also get loans in US dollars which means you are shorting the dollar against bitcoin. But those are both trading instruments which are only for short durations. 
For the next 5+ years at least, bitcoin will be way too volatile to loan out for any real duration.

Exactly, it means zilch. All it means is that the holder of the account signed Satoshi's old key. Why in the world would Satoshi sign stuff the wrong way? Did he forget how to use PGP? I don't think so.
PGP is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more secure than your average website or email address. Just like bitcoin, if you don't have the private key you can't sign anything. No passwords to break here, just insane crypto to try and steal. (lol steal Satoshi's PGP keys XD) 
If it still doesn't make sense I can find some resources for you. But just know that breaking PGP isn't going to happen anytime soon. And the old key has to sign the new one for the new one to be validated by the old identity.

Sure, this is why bitcoiners hang out here. We like to talk about what we have learned. I knew literally nothing about this stuff when I started learning about bitcoin. Even if you don't own bitcoin, just understanding it and what it means to the world will make you a wealthier person with your knowledge. It's kinda hard to sum all of it up with a simple, "Well bitcoin is programmable money and its cool because fiat sucks."


Gold was the currency of choice for thousands of years. It was not ideal but it was a lot better than shells, obsidian, and [rai stones]( Bitcoin may be a step back into the deflationary direction but there are other parts of bitcoin which make it more ideal than fiat. I am going to address them with some of your other points.


First of all, irreversible transactions are a feature not a bug. Many detractors of bitcoin seem to think this is a bad thing but they use the dollar every day. When you give someone $20 bill and they walk away with it, that is an irreversible transaction. If you need to return the next day and demand a refund then they can give you a new $20 bill back. The issue of transactions being reversed is a [multi billion dollar fraud industry]( It's easy for merchants to create a new transaction and hard for them to figure out which transaction has been invalidated. This can lead to all kinds of fraud.
And while I can agree that chargebacks can be good in some instances, it generally is only on the customer side of the deal. Bitcoin is great for accounting and combating credit card theft. It makes it close to impossible to steal someones money if they use it properly. This is not true of credit cards. Again I can agree bitcoin is not currently user friendly. I use bitcoin and I love it, however my family has trouble understanding it. There are plenty of ways to fix these problems and many are already in the works. Bitcoin allows for **much** greater security than we currently have with the credit card system.


Check out the colored coin project or mastercoins. The blockchain allows you to securely make contracts for literally any security. Forget bitcoin, you can trade oil, gold, stocks, fiat, mortgages, and more. You can do all of this irrespective of any government. Can you imagine an IPO for a cocaine production facility in South America? If you trusted the seller of course. Bitcoin revolutionizes finance like the radio, tv, and internet revolutionized communication. And yeah, I wouldn't want a debt in bitcoins either but then again I wouldn't want a debt in Google stock. This idea also falls under my personal opinion of "you need a deflationary asset/currency for a healthy economy."


I think bitcoin is a bit like gold in this respect. Gold was the first currency to take hold of the globe and really change global trade. However it had a host of drawbacks and it fell out of favor. Fiat took over but we are already discussing its drawbacks.
Bitcoin is the first crypto to take hold, and I will tell you why I believe in its value. Bitcoin is the first crypto and that makes it special, being first means any and all money which comes into *any* cryptocurrency has to go through bitcoin. Why? Because the infrastructure is being set up that way. You are correct it may not last but it will be valuable until someone contends for the crown or some government is successful in shutting it down (lol fat chance). All money interested in the crypo universe will fall into bitcoin irrespective of its eventual outcome.
Bitcoin has been called a black hole for fiat for just this reason. Fiat goes in, value comes out. You can't explain that.


Excellent points.


Deflation is death for an inflationary economy. You literally can't make it disappear. If you do the whole thing comes crashing down, that is why Japan is printing like mad and "will do whatever it takes." There is only one direction on this fiat train because that is all they can do. You can cut inflation but you can't make it into deflation. [This political comic is spot on](


That is an easy one, the emperor has no clothes. The value of a dollar is whatever everyone believes it is. When hyperinflation happens, god forbid, it happens all at once. Until that happens, full tilt on the presses! Why? Because until the music stops you are printing **VALUE!** This means you do get a boost in the economy until the jig is up.
When I say we have a choke-hold on reserve currency, I mean it's just like we have been given a licence to print gold. Until the plebeians figure out that we have no money left, we can party all night long. The citizens of the world demand US dollars and debt. We are the iron clad rule and no one can challenge our supremacy because we have all the gold. No really, [we hold tons of other countries gold](


Why do we have so much? Because other countries love and trust us of course /s. Actually it is fascinating, during/after WWII [all of the allies literally gave us their gold for safe keeping]( We promised them they could always redeem our dollars for gold. And then, I shit you not, [on 15 August 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US$ to gold](
Now all of this is far flung of course, and I hope that these thoughts remain a conspiracy until the end of time. But when you ask me why it hasn't happened yet you are asking me to understand powers beyond my control. I may love economics but I don't have a degree.
Don't even get me started on the theory that we might have [traded a lot of our gold to china]( Don't forget that a lot of it isn't ours.
Aaaand just tacking this on the end, we almost [outspend the rest of the world combined]( on our military. 




I 100% agree with you. Fiat is superior to gold in this aspect however I would argue that the end of fiat currencies is worse than a normal recession. This is an area of **huge** contention between Keynesian and Austrian viewpoints. Currently Keynesians are winning by saying, "Well we will never let those issues happen again, all of the currency wars are in the past. The current modern fiat system is unflappable."
GREAT! I am really, *really* glad to hear that. Because all of the other hyperinflation events caused *massive* wars and famine. Both WWI &amp; WWII were hugely fueled by currency wars. I am really glad fiat is fixed...
*However*, I am going out on a limb here and I am going to say that I personally don't have as much confidence as the Keynesian proponents on our current fiat system and I am going to hold my precious metals in my hand.
Please by all means, make them worthless. I really would rather not have a deflationary event like the great depression.

No, this comes off as advertising:




And this seems like you know what I am talking about:


This is an appeal to an authority. OP has nothing to do with our discussion and probably does not care. You are quite capable of talking out your own position without sarcasm. I am not attacking you, I am pointing out your logic and what you are suggesting. Just like this:


I am only using your language:






\^Entails exchange.
I am aware that the website is not only an exchange, I did take .02 seconds to read the front page of that website. I understand it is more than that.
This still has nothing to do with OP's question:


Quite literally asking where he can do business which won't tie him down with laws. Your suggestion was to do business with the company you were promoting. This exacerbates his problem and suggests no solution. Right here:


A European gaming/exchange/stock has no bearing on US money transmitter laws and AML laws unless I am mistaken. This was my original question which you have avoided multiple times now. I am simply asking how this company helps OP avoid being ensnared by the US bureaucracy legally. I also want answers to the OP's question because it is relevant to my interests. You don't have to answer if you do not know, or you can tell me you don't know.

Point out that the Internet and telephone were pretty useless at the beginning too. Hell even cars were shit in the beginning, it was insane news when a car beat a horse in a race. Check out s-curve adoption for more examples. 
While bitcoin is admittedly in its infancy  but that is kinda the point, by the time transaction volume is mainstream so will the price. Bitcoin may crash but the price is right where it should be right now, high enough to scare off the people unwilling to risk their funds on a crazy Internet currency.

I would like an apology.
How dare you try to assassinate my character by implying that I am a compulsive gambler. And even if I was, that would not mean that my opinion and knowledge was not valid.
You have no idea who I am, you have no idea who bitcoiners are. You have no clue what you are talking about. 
I am work at a TV station and I make about $20k a year. I save as much money as I can from *every* paycheck so I can buy a home. I am part of the local reddit community, I volunteer with local kids and animals, and I am a respected member of my community. I also happen to own bitcoins.
I invested back when they were $11-$60 and I bought them because I thought they were a revolutionary idea.
To give you an idea towards my gambling tendencies I am going to bore you with a peek into my weekly life. A casino was recently erected about 3 blocks from my work. I go there every few weeks to eat at the large number of restaurants inside. I have never once sat at the gambling tables. I feel that slots and cards are boring.
Now onto your absolute falsity that "bitcoin holders have the mentality of a compulsive gambler". Lets list some people who I know quite well. I volunteer with kids and they like to hear about bitcoins because they look up to me a large number of them have $1-$20 worth of bitcoin. I even gave one young lady who was a helpful friend an entire bitcoin when they were worth $30 or so, needless to say she is very happy. Are they gamblers?
How about the homeless people over at [Sean's Outpost]( Or the [martial arts instructor in Japan]( who accepted over 100btc for lessons when they were $30-$40 and he just decided to keep them (3:30 in the linked videos)? Or the countless other merchants who have decided that there may be something to this bitcoin thing after accepting them via bitpay? Seem like "compulsive gamblers" to you?
Your proxy attack on bitcoin via my personal dispositions was insulting and totally biased.
As for my bet, I made it simply because I was tired of people like you coming to this sub with preconceived notions and mocking people who were legitimate investors like myself. There are plenty of Wall St traders who do similar work and they get paid very well for it. If you think there aren't legitimate uses of bitcoin and investing in bitcoin, you are dead wrong.
I frustrated and I was tired of the recent influx of people who aren't educated about bitcoin which have all been calling totally legitimate comments outlandish. My bet was an easy way to get people to take my comments seriously. I knew you wouldn't take it, you don't know enough about bitcoin. If you did, you would have known that my bet was not something you wanted to be on the other side of.
Yes to invest in bitcoin is to speculate, but it is no different from speculating on gold, wheat, stocks, bonds, or land. All of those people have legitimate speculations on the potential price of bitcoin. There were also people who were laughed out to of the room when they talked about, "personal computers." They were considered insane too. We simply see something you do not.
Of course there are gamblers within bitcoin, just head over to the plethora of gambling sites and browse the forums to see the poor people who have lost hundreds if not thousands of bitcoins. But your attempt to say that bitcoiners are all gambling addicts is like saying that all christians are going to convert you, or that all gun enthusiasts are irrational and they love violence. It is simply and overgeneralization.
So I say again, do you care to test your fundamental analysis of bitcoin to mine? I wouldn't do it if I were you, you have no idea what you are talking about.

Of course disk space is a concern! Here let me put this in context: The total disk space in the world is finite, the total information in the world **infinite**.
I understand disk space is *less* of a concern nowadays but it doesn't mean you get to disregard the fact that disk space is limited. Heck people complain about the size of the blockchain even now. They are looking into pruning it for gods sake! This alone is so totally bogus, I can't believe that these people think they even understand what they are doing.

A bit? If I gave a homeless person my pennies I would just be looked at sideways. Especially if I gave them hundreds of pennies. 
I mean what would you think of someone who pulled a handful of pennies out of their pocket to give you? You would take them for sure but some people would just dump them because that many pennies aren't worth carrying around. A few dimes or quarters would make up for your loss. 
Granted bitcoins weigh nothing, my point is that even tipping pennies is odd. 
There is a reason we don't have hay pennies anymore.

Don't be asinine, of course the value cannot exceed the value of the planet. You are literally pulling this idea out of thin air and trying to foist it upon me like I was the one who said it.
However, your figure of 770% is well within bitcoins current growth rate, in fact it is low. I know, I know bitcoin can't keep the same growth rate as it has forever. So? The internet grew at an unprecedented pace as well and guess what, it is still here. Economies have bull markets, bear markets, and bubbles. This is what they do (The US FED would disagree with me however).
How about you take a more reasonable figure of 1-10% of the world GDP as the top end to bitcoin's valuation? It would easily have an [s-curve adoption rate]( and it would include the current growth easily.
The s-curve is seen all over in biological systems and technical systems everywhere. Cellphones, smartphones, laptops, insect growth, tablets, plant growth, email, and [so many more things have an s-curve adoption](
The one who is being delusional is not me, it is you. You are deluding yourself into thinking that I have not heard your arguments a hundred times by now. That you are the first person to be reasonable in the face of my "delusional frenzy." That I am an unreasonable gambler and that I haven't a clue what I am talking about.
I read fast, like 300-400WPM fast. My job allows me to read up to 6 hours a day if I wish, it is the best thing about my lacking paycheck. I read about bitcoin, economics, technology, crypto, and anything which tickles my fancy *every day*. I spend over a hundred hours a month reading and I have read about bitcoin for just over two years. I feel safe saying that I have an educated opinion about my topic of interest.
How much do you know about bitcoin? About finance? Money? Have you spent even a fraction of the time I have thinking about this?
Bitcoin is a legitimate financial tool and it will change the world. Boom or bust it will change the planet just like radio, tv, and the internet.
There are plenty of **real** problems with bitcoin. You know exactly zero of them. You have no clue what you are talking about.

No one is forcing you to use the system  and if you are selling $50 worth of goods I'm pretty sure $5-10 worth of bitcoin would be more than enough. It's not like you would need to do it for anything less than high value/large volume accounts anyway.

Don't forget to replace what you spend. It is fine to cash out if need be, but you don't have to spend your investment to support bitcoin. If you time it right you can even make money at it!

Well in the case where you personally know the auditor you could just tell him a "password"  that would be included in the signature which only the auditor and yourself knew. It would be pretty unreasonable to assume you were forcing someone else to sign the keys at that point.

Also, when using bitcoin services you should always test them out with small amounts. I personally lost a few satoshis and milibits when exploring the bitcoin realm and being cautious is a good trait to have.

Don't line up. You are talking about Keynesian economics and you don't even know it. If you want to say you don't prescribe to a particular school of thought that's ok but you need to understand that you are talking about political theory which is agreeing with a school of thought. It would be like saying that you don't believe in government but you aren't an anarchist. You can do it but you need to reference it anyway.
If you want to understand the gold vs fiat argument, you need to understand Keynesian economics vs Austrian economics. There are more refined schools of thought but they are mostly branched from these two main schools. [Here is a great short explanation]( of some main branches(~7 min video).
And think I was unclear here:


I meant to imply it was worthless as a currency, not as a commodity.


I agree that this in the intended effect of Keynesian economics. Personally I would like to see a cryptocurrency which has a set inflation rate, say 3% or something. I think it would be an amazing counter to bitcoin's deflationary model and could easily contend for the crown as leader of cryptocurrencies. I know I would own some. I just don't believe in our governments ability to stay impartial in the distribution of wealth. The Libor rate-rigging scandal is only the latest in a long line of problems which underscore the inability of the government to understand the private banking sector and create suitable laws. I am not blaming government or private in particular, I am blaming both together as a singular institution.


I think you misunderstand the power of the miners over the masses. You don't have to own a miner to influence changes in bitcoin, you simply need to make a fork and convince the masses to use your branch. Miners choose which fork to use. Tyranny of the masses is a much bigger risk than a small powerful elite here. Eventually the free market will decide which currency makes the cut though. Bitcoin may only be the 'Napster' of cryptocurrencies. The cat is out of the bag though, crypto is here to stay.


Gold trading faces similar difficulties. For example when you ship gold the price may fluctuate wildly, the same happens with just about any commodity. This is why futures contracts were invented, to hedge the risk of a value fluctuation. For example, you are worried about bitcoin devaluing under $200 so you buy an insurance contract to pay you the difference if it goes under that amount. The Insurance company is betting on the upside and will take a percentage of the difference after say $800. Both parties can win so long as they structure the deal right. Bitcoin is a little too volatile right now for most players though. But don't forget that big risk can equal big gain.


My video reference to Keynesian economics and Austrian economics above is a pretty good one. If it still doesn't make sense let me know. I would like to explain it after you have at least a small handle on the concept. The TLDW is basically like you said above for Keynesian economics. Austrians believe the boom and bust cycle is necessary and the attempt to lessen it via fiat printing only exacerbates the problem. This has happened [time and again in history]( as I already mentioned.
Do I believe in or want the death of the usd or fiat in general? I hope every last Austrian is dead wrong. I want every single one to lose out on every bet they have made. Including myself. Because if they are right we are in for tough times in the next 5-15 years. Fiat collapse has *ALWAYS* meant great suffering just as gold deflation has. However they tend to go hand in hand historically. You could argue WWII was caused by hyperinflation as well as a plethora of other wars and famines. In every case government has had a *huge* hand in the debasement of currency and a wealthy elite helped and profited along the way.
I have no idea how to fix the problem but I damn well understand the risks. And I won't be caught by the tide of any of these dramatic swings. I wish everyone else understood as much and how to hedge the problems we face in the coming decade.
So you ask me whether deflation is good or bad? I can't give you a simple answer but I say the same of inflation. When people ask me a question like that, I feel like they are asking me which poison is tastier. I think the only way out is a mix of both, I just hope we aren't already in too deep.

When she asks him if he trusts Satoshi and that there will ever only be 21mil btc, I wanted to push him aside and say. Do you trust the guy who invented email? You don't have to trust him because it belongs to the public domain. You are essentially saying that you don't trust the math behind bitcoin. It is math, it's either right or it's wrong, there is no inbetween. You are literally calling every person working on the bitcoin code a liar because you think Satoshi sounds weird.
Other scientists trust math and code because they read it and say, "Oh cool, this looks great! I am going to use this!"
Code isn't a magic box lady, it is a machine.
**Edit**: I would go one step further and say that I trust bitcoin's code more than I trust my car. Because bitcoin is worked on and improved upon by international efforts, it is more secure and tested than my vehicle. You can speculate about the value, and you can speculate about the NSA breaking encryption but you can't say that it isn't secure, "Because Satoshi!"

Yes, basic computer security was kind of entailed. But if you want me to enumerate all of the attack vectors, how to use a live CD, and best practices, I would need to answer more than the direct question OP asked.
How much of a tinfoil hat do you want to wear? If you are that paranoid, then your entire computer is already compromised and all of your email, banking, web credentials, credit card numbers, SSNs, and online tax info is already compromised. You are suggesting that the malware totally compromised the computer and didn't do anything else besides steal the bitcoins. This sounds kind of absurd.
Yes, I agree that you need to have a secure computer. Yes, I agree that you need to use paper wallets from a trusted computer which is preferably an air-gapped live CD of some kind.
No, I don't see the need to make my answer any more complex than it has to be. You are asking a mechanic to tell you how to make sure your car is locked up tight when you asked them how to open the doors and turn the key on the ignition.
If the OP or anyone else had questions, all they had to do was ask.

Why does the insurance company have to be transparent? I was referring to Xapo and their website.


Was I unclear here? I'm sorry. I meant that if I was an insurance company I would demand that Xapo be transparent with their inner workings. I say this in reference to almost every bitcoin theft you can think of.
I don't think a bitcoin wallet service can be properly run unless it is transparent. Maybe not open source, not that I would trust any such service, but definitely auditable and transparent.
If it was my insurance company I would want to be able to audit the books and the code at my whim because there is no reason I couldn't. It would also be to my benefit because people would want to use my service. 
What would be the upside of having an opaque wallet service?

As others have said, it really isn't as bad as you say 
And  it *is* like email in the sense that you can modify the code an make your own. Plenty of examples abound. 
 you are totally sidestepping the point I am making about the code being reviewable and verifiable. You are attempting to rehash her argument from another angle stating, "Well even if bitcoin is a protocol Satoshi has a lot of bitcoins." Which is an entirely different argument from saying that Satoshi can change code arbitrarily or insinuating that bitcoin itself is shady.

Yes, I understand you can create a cryptographically secure file in a live cd type environment. No, labeling every transfer is probably not a great idea because the vast majority of users will probably not have enough knowledge to go full tinfoil enough to keep their file secure.

But the  thing you need to know is that *the reason why they are skeptical is because they don't want you to get scammed*. You just need to bring them with you on your journey to understand bitcoin. Don't sell them moon rockets and million dollar bitcoins, they want to know that you understand the risks and are willing to take them.
How do you prove it's not a scam? If you can't answer that question yourself, you don't have enough information to articulate bitcoin to your parents. "Cuz da Interwebz say it's not!!!" Is not a real answer, they want hard evidence.
Ask your dad how you are supposed to prove to him it's not a scam. Because people around the world do ***real*** business with bitcoin every day. Venture capitalist investors have pumped tens of millions into the bitcoin economy. And governments are taking it so seriously that they are making laws about it. **You** are underestimating bitcoin, magic Internet monies are serious businezz.
Tell him that you refuse to let him dismiss it as a scam outright but that you would like his help to better understand it. (Say it nice, teenagers tend to miss the finer points of communication.)
Show him you are willing to take a cautious approach, buy $20 worth or something small you don't care to lose. (Come on dad, you can't tell me that testing things before you use them is bad parenting.) Use it to buy something from a reputable place like Overstock, and demonstrate that it is in fact, real money.
Don't tell them that it is safe, stable, or anything short of a crazy gamble. Don't tell them the Internet promised riches, tell them the Internet told you bitcoin was a serious tool which required serious study and understanding.
There are people who **WILL** take all your money if you don't understand how to use bitcoin. They are just waiting for you to fumble with shitty passwords, not using 2FA, or any number of other vulnerabilities.
Stay safe my bitcoin friends.

Depends on what security you are talking about. Food is obvious, oil is too, houses and land have obvious utility. Lets try something like gold. Gold is in demand because it is: scarce, fungible, divisible, durable, portable, and non-consumable (kinda). So besides the obvious small industrial use for electronics why does gold command a high price?
Because people believe it to be a store of value.
Granted they have thousands of years of history on their side. But the next question is, what is value? You can value *anything*. We have valued shells, beads, dye, china, silk, tulips, ivory, obsidian, quetzal feathers, and so many more things. Value is whatever you say it is. This is as true of WOW gold as it is of a $100 bill.
The only real question left is, will other people value bitcoin besides bitcoiners? Which is why the price is $600 and not $60k+
Don't try to school me on the properties and history of money. I know enough to know what bitcoin is and what it is not.


Read about the decentralized exchanges, localbitcoins, or really how there is a zero barrier to entry to make a competing exchange. I buy and sell bitcoins on a regular basis. You can't convince me that exchanges are a problem. There are plenty of options, alternatives, and new ideas in the works. Innovation abounds.

Cool thanks for the article!
**TLDR** For everyone: Dollar cost averaging is stupid because




Which I personally can't agree with due to the volatility of bitcoin, and the "Well it's a rare occurrence" mentality. Gamble if you wish, but DCA is safe for a reason. Buy the dips and you will do even better (This only applies to bulls, bears should short the tops. Be brave bears!)
And this:


Can be true but you would have to pick a dip and not a peak, something most of us suck at doing.
This article also seemed to be geared towards stocks and bonds, but not commodities. 


While bitcoin is a questionable "commodity", it does carry many of the same scarcity characteristics. I would argue the use of commodity investment techniques. ~~The article also did not disclose the data/metrics they were basing their claims on.~~ **Edit**: Never mind, missed [the PDF](
And this:


Makes it seem *perfect* for bitcoin when it does the consolidation swing thing.


Lastly, this is grade A propaganda:


**Edit2**: After reviewing the PDF I would **NEVER** put down a lump sum on bitcoin (vs DCA) because the gains are negligible vs the volatility risk.


So overall... Do what works for you.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

Don't get all judgmental just because I know how to make money on a volatile security. Let me worry about my personal finances.


... Maybe you missed the part about being paid in bitcoin. I know it would be stupid of an employer to pay me in bitcoin if they are being paid in usd. If they do that they would be moronic. If they make their profits in bitcoin on the other hand. No problem.

You literally ignored what I just said. 
Do you know how to make a cryptographic algorithm? No? Neither do 99% of bitcoiners. It isn't necessary to use bitcoin. 
Do you know how to build a computer chip? No? Neither do 99% of computer users. It isn't necessary to use a computer. 
The warning is akin to telling someone not to work on their car engine if they don't know how it works. You might do just fine or you might just break your car.

Fiat currencies are not stable because of a central bank. Fiat currencies are not always stable. Central banks cannot always control the stability of their currencies, no matter how much they try. Paper money offers no more security in times of turmoil than many other assets, some could even argue that fiat is less secure in times of crisis.
I can understand your point that bitcoin has flaws but you are acting like fiat is a universal constant. Fiat is not the speed of light. Fiat is a piece of paper backed by nothing but government violence which says you can't copy their bills. Fiat is a debt instrument just like any other.
I can understand your aversion to volatility, it can cripple economies and deflation can cause mass famine. I can agree that inflation is a good thing. I can even agree that this may be the eventual death of bitcoin.
Fiat does not hold a candle to bitcoin. I am not talking about _this_ version of bitcoin, I am talking about the _idea_ of bitcoin.
We have invented programmable money, it is superior to fiat in almost every way. You can make it inflationary, you can put $100 billion in your pocket, you can send it anywhere, you can literally make it do anything you can dream of, and **it cannot be stopped**.
Bitcoin is going to change everything.

If bitcoin is successful, and if governments try all of this regulation, either bitcoin will change and become more anonymous or users will move to a more anonymous altcoin. If I were the government I would be so friendly to bitcoiners because they are giving me the chance to make laws which will allow collect *some* revenue. Making hostile legislation will just make crypto users even more hostile to the government. This will just become another drug war type deal, and crypto is a lot easier to smuggle than a boat full of cocaine. For better or worse, crypto is here to stay.

Pass the fees onto the buyer, they are the ones who want what you are selling. Why would you eat the fees? You aren't running a charity, you are facilitating a transaction. If they want cheaper bitcoins then they can find someone else willing to sell at a different price. Take a look at localbitcoins and see what your neighbors are selling for, I bet the price per bitcoin isn't cheaper than spot. And if it is... Buy those suckers and sell them on bitstamp! Make instant profit. (this is why spot price is important)

That is like saying that you can discriminate against women, jewelry, or black people because you never agreed to the social contact. You don't get to pick and choose which parts of society you like. 
I don't like a lot of societies rules either but you can't just flippantly disregard them because you don't think they are right. Abortion, equal treatment of women and African Americans, taxes, and more are all good examples of both sides of the fence. 
"Lol taxes are bad mmkay!" Is not an argument and neither is, "I never agreed to that!" You could just as easily say you never agreed to the drug war, murder, police, or driving standards.

This literally has NOTHING to do with PGP. A PGP key is generated entirely separate from an email address. You don't need an email to use PGP. 


Yes, exactly. No PGP key signature means Satoshi did not sign the message. Period. A PGP key is a fingerprint you can put onto any message or data you would like to verify that it was you so signed it. For all intensive purposes it is impossible to duplicate. It far easier to steal the private key. If you stole Satoshi's key you could easily sign it the right way.
 


No, no! You can't say he said anything unless he signed it. This is how anonymous programmers communicate securely.
You could argue that he used it and did not sign it properly but as I keep saying, why would **SATOSHI** the father of cryptocurrencies **forget how to use PGP properly**. I find this _highly_ improbable and next to impossible.
Yes, it could be him. He would have to log into that account and do something he has never done before, do it wrong, and then not say anything after. This is highly unlikely. Your original Occam's razor applies here.


He does not have to have Satoshi's email. No. False. There are loads of ways around this.
Even if he did have Satoshi's email. PGP would verify who controlled the email account. It is impossible to use a PGP key without the private key. A private key has nothing to do with any centralized communication like email. If you figure out a way to break PGP then the government would like a word with you and you can make billions stealing secrets.
You generate a key, you keep the private piece. You share the public piece with all of your communications. If you need a new one for whatever reason you just sign the new one with the old one. If the old one does not sign the new one it is **not valid**. This is what gives PGP its security and strength.
Here is a [visual representation of a PGP message encryption process](
You can send PGP messages without email. You can include them in almost any type of message they will fit into.
Like I said before, unless the old key signs the new one there is no reason to believe that it was Satoshi. Every day that passes lends more credence to the theory that the account was just compromised in some manner.
**Edit**: [Here is the old sig]( if you want to look at it, not that is will make much sense if you haven't used PGP before. You can see how other people have signed it besides Satoshi. 
**Edit2**: [This sig]( is the one which signed from the supposedly compromised email. As you can see, the old sig has not signed the new one. Yeah, I know it is about as clear as mud.
**Edit3**: This is what was inferred by your president sig link:

As someone who really likes bitcoin and is very bullish; using bitcoin to keep your cash safe from authorities is risky at best. You are more likely to have wild swings in value, and you just might lose a lot of your money anyway. Holding bitcoin is a pretty poor solution to this problem.

I just think this whole money transmission thing is BS. Bitcoin is not only useful, it won't be stopped. It may not be bitcoin in the end but if you try and kill it, it will only grow more heads. Heck right now YOU CAN SEE THE BLOCKCHAIN! This is HUGE from a LEO standpoint. You can watch the black market in real time! You may not know who the wallets belong to but it gives you an opportunity you didn't have before.
There are altcoins which have no visible blockchain, that would be a horrible for a LEO. This idea that we can regulate bitcoin out of existence is BS. The government should be jumping on this with a vengeance and not in the way they are doing. They have a huge opportunity to help grow bitcoin into something useful from their standpoint.
And you can see the results in this thread, the legit people are all looking for ways to flee! No serious law abiding person is talking about ducking taxes, they just want to stay out of trouble.

Yes, I understand that it is not perfect, but it requires the scammer to invest money. And the more money the scammer has to put in, the more they sweat about making a return. 
Reddit's username system, for example, requires no investment of any kind. This leads to mass burning of usernames and this is not a big deal for reddit. 
However, if you are a scammer and you want to create a bunch of 1btc burner reviews on OpenBazaar... It will cost you a pretty penny and you have no guaranteed return. Personally I like that my potential attacker has to sweat it out when attacking me. 
**Edit**: Not to mention that the amount they would be scamming me out of is probably a significant amount less than 10 btc worth of reviews. The investment here to scam people would be quite large and you would probably be better off just being honest. All you need to do is make it more costly to scam than be honest.
Of course you could still get burned , life is that way. But using an escrow system combined with this system would make it pretty damn hard to scam someone. I am sure we will come up with even more safeguards as time goes on. I have been watching bitcoin evolve for 3 years and the advancements never cease to astound me.

Did you also read about the guy who took his life savings/home loan and put it into bitcoin at ~$1000? His wife left him and he panic sold at the bottom. There are two sides to these coins (pun not intended). 
I have heard plenty of moon stories, and I'm a stupid hodler instead of a daytrader. Putting everything you have in an experimental currency is absurd and reckless. You might win big but you also might win big by putting all your money on black. Bitcoin is not a sure thing. It might not even survive the usd collapse, I hope you have some gold to back up your digital duckets when the wheels of public opinion start to turn.

Because that line about the fine was not obvious when I first skimmed it. /s
Yes, I understand that the fine is actually $5k, but that section has nothing about the size of items needed to be filed. I understand that I need to file taxes, I have no problem with that. I have a problem with the idea that I need to file a zillion microtransactions.
I have been reading all of this stuff and it is **not clear at all**. This tax code stuff is about as clear as a brick. And going down to H&amp;R block and asking them to do my bitcoin return will get me blank stares and questions about my sanity.
I don't want to become a tax expert, I just want to file my return and not get audited. Is that so much to ask?
**Edit**: Upon closer inspection, it is even less clear than I originally thought:


Please tell me what a 'frivolous submission' actually is. Is it 10 pages? 50? 200? What? Because I don't see it.
This is the closest thing I found:
C-Filings - This frivolous position includes four categories of filings as follows
 	a. An individual files a return claiming various types of deductions, credits, or overpayments/refunds that have no relation to reality and because of their outrageous character, qualify as frivolous returns.
 	b. An individual files a return containing the filers identifying information but does not request a refund, often lacking sufficient information to determine a tax liability.
 	c. An individual files a return with various types of rambling dialogue and/or crazy arguments that no one could reasonably view as a good faith attempt to comply with the law.
 	d. An individual files a return that attempts to send some type of message or protest to the IRS, but fails to include sufficient identifying information for the Service to either determine the identity of the taxpayer or correspondent or return address.
And if you want to read more of a boring tax document please feel free to educate me. I won't be reading anymore.
**Edit2**: Oh look
4.10.12.1.3  (02-23-2012)

In what way has any of advice from reasonable speculators ever stated that bitcoin is a safe investment? All I see in this statement is an investor stating he still believes in his investment, safe or not.
I love the fundamentals of bitcoin as much as the next bitcoiner but I would never call it a safe investment. Bitcoin is an experiment in the world of finance, experiments fail all the time. We just happen to think this experiment has value and we are gambling on its long term viability.

\ Naked "abusive naked short selling" illegal.

\ Said ETF would need to publish their holdings which would likely include the bitcoin address/addresses or have contracts stating delivery from another source 
\ Not getting contracts or moving bitcoin out of the published addresses would make for a very short lived company 
Bitcoin isn't like gold where you can promise people that they don't need to visit their vault. Anyone can look at the vault and see that they are still where they should be.

Now that I am done with that textwall, I can reply to your comment here.


Not only is this opinion, it seems like you haven't even tried to use bitcoin. Buying things with bitcoin on my phone is a joy. But hey, you can feel this way if you want.


Why yes, this is a problem. I do believe that is why bitcoin is worth $500 and not $100k yet. That is how these things work right? When you invest in a growing company, commodity, or bond you are hoping the price will go up and that your analysis of the security is better than everyone elses.


Good point, but see my above comment  And  I know that Overstock just made a million in sales, I also know that tigerdirect has done a lot of business and bitcoin black friday was one of bitcoin's biggest commerce days of all time. Is it enough? We shall see.


Karma? I literally had not heard of this until you told me. Sounds like a waste of money to me. But I have heard of worse ways to waste your money. Big deal, people buy what they want.


Let's take gold as an example: The consumption of gold produced in the world is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry([wiki]( This means that if we parked a gold asteroid in orbit tomorrow that at least 40% of gold consumption(demand) would fall through the floor. I would imagine that would affect the demand for jewelry as well.
Seems to me that gold does not have a lot of industrial purposes. So what gives gold the majority of it's value? Speculation and a small supply. A securities economic activity is not an indicator of it's value. Supply and demand are.
People see value in bitcoin so the value rises. They hoard it so the supply decreases. Bubble? We shall see.


What in the world do exchanges have to do with the value of bitcoin? That is like saying that the NYSE died and so the USD will die. Who cares? 
Pump bitcoin? Well maybe, if you check out the bitcointalk forums, you can see that there is someone who has been dubbed, "the benevolent manipulator." Who keeps bitcoin from doing crazy price swings in between the short term bubbles. Are they going to dump all their coins at some point and destroy bitcoin? Idk but I think bitcoin will be able to survive, I invested didn't I?
Whatever happens, cryptocurrencies are here to stay. The market demands it. If you don't get it, you are no different than the people who thought the internet was stupid and that "640K of memory should be enough for anybody."
You don't have to believe or understand my points, I am just tired of not being taken seriously. Bitcoin is not a joke.
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:11:17
Why not hoard and use? Just buy back what you spend when you spend it. If you time it right you can even play the market with your purchase amount. Last year I bought Christmas presents and some other things around $900. Bought back around 500, and I am super happy with my purchases. 
Hoarding is good for bitcoin, it drives adoption and media coverage. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:47:16
I am not really sure what is so hard for everyone to understand about the fact that you are asking for permission to access something I don't want accessed.


I have plenty of social apps, I will decide when I want to be social. No I don't trust you to not peek at my diary. This is exactly why I didn't install it. I am capable of saying making that judgement.


I am more concerned that every app and permission which I add, adds a potential vector for someone to glean my data from. The plethora of three letter agencies and random hackers/attackers have enough already. I am glad you are doing your best with security but that is not the issue I have. I don't want to add apps which need more permissions than they need and I really don't like it when apps take a "Just trust us!" approach. I spend a lot of time researching apps when they ask for my trust and I don't spend time evaluating every app which comes along, especially if I have a viable alternative which does not ask for the same amount of trust.
I admit that I am not a normal user but I feel like I am probably not the only one who takes this approach.

What is up with the history of bitcoin being added to the comparison? It just reads like an attempt at discrediting bitcoin. Why not add the history of gold? Because it's too old that is why! This has no bearing on anything.
Will gold rebound? What? Are you trying to imply that an ounce gold will be worth more than a single bitcoin? Because it Already is! Market participation? Mining costs? 3 categories for inflation!? Why are you attempting to discredit bitcoin!? **It's not a threat to gold**!
Gold has a 2500+ year history and will be around until we mine the ocean floors and asteroids for it! If you are trying to imply that gold is a better hedge against the USD collapse, guess what, **YOU ARE 110% CORRECT**! Gold wins!
This is like trying to compare computer hard drives vs stone tablets. Stone tablets are thousands of years old so they are better! They have a proven track record of keeping data! B-but you can clone HDs and make them small... Stone tablets won't lose data when the power goes out! Stone tablets will be here long after we are gone!
You are correct! But HDs **were not invented to replace stone tablets**!! Stop comparing them in unfair areas! We can use both! In fact we *SHOULD* use both!

Who uses a password to protect their bitcoins? Paper wallets are the bomb. You can make copies or split them up into separate pieces. 
Paper wallets are stupid easy to make too. 
Irreversible transactions are a feature not a bug. Google escrow. 
Afraid of a market crash? Don't invest. Bitcoin is not for the faint of heart. 
Bitcoin is pseudonymous, it was never intended to be anonymous. 
Transactions confirm in seconds, you only need to wait for full confirmations if you are worried about a double spending attack. BitPay doesn't wait, why should you?

While I am glad you are taking steps to protect players and I think your concept is awesome, I have to say that I am cautious with my coins. I have also seen players in Ingress jeer at one another in person, when money is involved I'm not sure what might happen. 
This just seems high risk for a game which has my money and person involved. I readily admit my aversion and over cautious nature. I just wanted to voice my opinion because others may feel the same. 
I think this game sounds like great fun but I kinda want to watch before jumping in.

Gold is not explicitly mentioned on that page because it is only a small part of their economic theory and any deflationary asset could take its place. Take [the first line of the wiki article on the gold standard advocates here](


This does not mean gold is the only supported currency of the Austrian ideal nor does it mean that they agree with deflation being always a good thing.
Literally from the page you linked.


The inflation and deflation in the value of assets is what both schools of thought strive to avoid. Overvaluation and undervaluation are both undesirable and, as discussed in the video, what governments strive to squash. In a perfect world they would succeed, however this has not historically happened.


You are misunderstanding what I am saying. I don't think bitcoin, gold, or any other deflationary asset make a prefect currency. I am saying if you ask me to choose between an inflationary government fiat currency and a natural deflationary currency I will choose the one which is not being inflated for political reasons. In today's political climate that makes me an Austrian. And as you can tell, my position is much more nuanced than that. This is why I referred earlier to the point of saying that you can only discuss this topic when you understand both schools of thought and reference their differing ideas. Explaining the difference between the two allows you to discuss the underlying viewpoint of each party. Just like how discussing Libertarians vs Statists will bring up all kinds of shades of grey in the middle.
The price of gold and silver is being manipulated. This is being done to keep the usd as world's reserve currency. Other countries know we are doing this and want to get away from the US's ability to hurt their economies. Why do I know this? Because if I was the US and I had a crushing debt on the books that is what I would do to protect my countrymen. When I say that wars have historically started this way, this is what I am talking about.
The difference between history and now is simply a larger scale. The usd is the reserve currency of the entire globe. The US doesn't want people to go back to the gold standard and the rest of the world is unhappy that the US has the ability to print their reserve currency out from underneath them. We are using our position as a weapon because the rest of the world has no choice.
[Japan is struggling to keep up with our inflation because we are printing so fast]( (QE = inflation, we literally buy the toxic mortgages and debts of failing US companies and let them fail.) The BOJ has stated they will do "whatever it takes" to inflate away their problem. They are facing a MASSIVE deflationary collapse if they don't. [Currency wars]( [are well underway](
If you say I need to prove my claims, simply [look at what our monetary policy is doing to India]( And understand that banks no longer use gold as a reserve but only US paper dollars which are controlled by the US central bank. We have a licence to print the world's reserve currency and no one can stop us.


Yeah I got lazy and I was having trouble finding a properly sourced article. I have seen them before but I couldn't remember the title. [This one]( and [this one]( are sourced much better and much easier to check with Wikipedia or other sources. Less over the top too. Don't feel like you need to read all that though. I am just saying that the history of reserve currency status [looks like this]( 


This is totally true and exactly the point I am making about my distrust of the banking institution and the government bodies linked to it. Crypto allows you to avoid all of that if you wish. While cryptocurrencies are in an adolescent stage they allow for the ability of the average person to avoid the politics of government in their banking institutions and currency. This is why I invest in bitcoin, not because it is deflationary but because it is a monetary revolution. We have invented programmable money which, I believe, will turn into the perfect currency.
**TLDR**: Gold is better than fiat only because you can't make more of it. This is only necessary because fiat is inflated and is causing an asset bubble which will subsequently cause a crash (I hope not). Neither gold, fiat, or deflationary currency are a solution to this problem. I believe that both deflationary and inflationary securities are necessary for a stable economy. There is currently no stable inflationary security which is not subject to corruption.
**Edit**: Oh and I believe that deflationary credit swings are necessary for a healthy economy. Gold and bitcoin are simply examples. I think the Keynesian idea of totally removing credit swings is bogus.

What part of the above quote was unclear as to why they were burning the bitcoins? I tried to pick the clearest part of the explanation. You burn bitcoins as a way of proving that you are serious about investing in the identity. 
For example if someone burned a $100 bill on YouTube so that everyone could see they were serious about their investment in their channel. The larger the denomination, the more they are investing in trying to demonstrate their legitimacy.  
It's not like we care if anyone loses bitcoins anyway. We can always divide them further, and by destroying them the rest just become more valuable. 
Escrow is diseperate from the reputation system. I'm not really sure how that is unclear :/

You are talking chicken and egg. If everyone paid each other in gold, the value of gold isn't a big deal. Conversely, why would you take a loan in usd if you live in an area which pays in Nigerian Naira? You would be totally screwed. In that case the usd seems like a raw deal.
The real problem is volatility, the extreme price movement in either direction. People investing in bitcoin believe the volatility will fall as  it reaches it's "final" valuation.
Gold is still valuable despite being volatile, granted it is a lot less volatile than bitcoin. You are essentially saying gold is worthless because it fluctuates in value. 
You can say that an inflationary currency provides stability but you have to understand that you are taking a Keynesian economic viewpoint. Keynesian economics is not the only way to look at the way economies work and there are greatly differing viewpoints within the world of economics. It's just an opinion despite how the US Federal Reserve treats it as a fact of life. 
No seriously, this is not like the 'theory of evolution' or the 'theory of gravity'. There is no concrete evidence Keynesian economics will work. The US was only taken off of the gold standard in 1933 and off of silver in 1968. We have been part of a Keynesian experiment for the last 40-80 years. The gold standard has been around for thousands of years and literally every last fiat currency has failed. Ever. Period. The usd is just the most current version of histories failure to learn from its mistakes.
Believe what you want about Keynesian economics but know that no government can ever really hold to the theory because of internal corruption. If you wanted to make a steady rate of inflation it might work but you can't do than when banks are so large they can bend the debasement of fiat money to their will. 
Banks profit from the inflation of your dollars. They are the ones in control of the policies setting the rates of inflation and monetary policy.
See a conflict of interest there? Me too.
So yeah, I get what you are saying. Bitcoin would be hard to deal with economically at the moment. And no I don't agree with you that fiat is 'safe'. Safe is relative.
You keep your faith in the usd, I will choose to diversify into other investments.

With highly specialized and expensive equipment. Not worth it unless you are prepared for a **lot** of research and take on a lot of risk on top of investing in bitcoin. Just buy some.


If you want a wallet on your computer, try one like electrum where you don't have to download the blockchain. Downloading the blockchain is a long and painful process. I would recommend against computer based wallets unless you feel that you are savvy with computer security. There are a large number of theft vectors when using a personal computer based wallet, this includes Macs. Trojans, keyloggers, and social engineering are all gunning for your btc.
For military grade security use a paper wallet. [Here is a good short tutorial](
Put your smaller amounts of funds into a cellphone or web based wallet like blockchain or mycelium. **ALWAYS ENABLE 2FACTOR AUTHENTICATION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING**. Passwords of 18+ characters in length are suggested. [Here is a good site to understand how secure your passwords are]( Keep your larger portions in paper wallets. You will sleep well at night knowing that no one will take your bitcoin, unless bitcoin itself is broken. Mo' wallets are mo' better. A thief can't easily clean out all of your life's savings, if your savings are split up all over the place.
I would suggest reading and understanding wallets more overall. It will be useful for the security of your btc. Don't be like the guy on the Bloomberg show who flashed his private key on the air. His btc was stolen within seconds.


A copy of bitcoin. There are many copies and 99.99% of them are totally worthless. If you feel the need to buy some just don't get taken to the cleaners. Use caution and common sense and you will probably be fine. Dodgecoin is a joke, some people made money on it though...


If "trustworthy" means 'work really hard for practically no money'. Then yes. [My post in this other thread explains it quite well]( Just buy some.
**TLDR**: Buy some bitcoins, use a paper wallet, and use your noggin.

I am unaware of a fiat reserve currency which lasted more than ~110 years. Do you have more information on this? 
I agree that crypto is an experiment, but so is fiat. The only reserve currency which has lasted is gold, despite all its flaws. Gold has been around for all of written history, fiat currencies come and go compared to gold. (Don't buy gold right now, it's still falling.) 
So as far as I know, it's not "some" fiat currencies which fail. As far as I know, they all have a limited lifespan, and the larger ones actually fail sooner. 
Please enlighten me if I am incorrect.

Him, idk. But I have read enough about bitcoin and I believe in the fundamentals enough to feel confident in my bet.
I feel that my $5k prediction is low and safe which is why I made the bet. I wouldn't bet on it but I feel that the end of 2014 or the 1st quarter of 2015 is when the $5k mark will be breached.
[Here is a MUCH better TA]( than the link up above.
He references all kinds of growth rates and supports his graphs with data.
Personally I believe that bitcoin may fail but cryptocurrency is here to stay. But for bitcoin to fail it would take MUCH more than the current problems to take it down. There would need to at least need to be a major DDOS on the blockchain, a major crypto failure, or someone would need to be able to create private keys on demand.
The fundamentals are stupidly strong, there are literally no competitors to bitcoin. If a real competitor comes I might start to sweat but I can't really see that happening. They would have to have enough of an advantage to kick the first mover out of its seat. And that would be pretty amazing considering all of the massive advantages bitcoin offers over traditional currency and markets. It would be akin to creating another internet, email, or cellphone. You can create something to usurp them but it would need to be better by far.
Bitcoin may die, but crypto is here to stay.

If you use localbitcoins here are some tips to feel and be safe:
Meet in a public setting like a coffee shop. 
USE ESCROW! INSIST ON IT! It's a trivial fee for the safety. 
Start with smaller amounts, $20-$40. Not $1000 the first time you meet someone. 
Talk with them, I am a seller and I don't make that much money. I'm there to help people. Even if they are out to make money they should be able to communicate clearly enough to make you feel confident about your trade. 
I hear mycelium is good for this too.

Except when assets deflate towards infinity. But don't worry, that will never happen as I have complete faith in the US government and the military industrial complex. They will fight to keep dollar as the world reserve currency until their dying breaths. The only way that they could ever lose is if the rest of the world colluded against them to deflate assets and undermine the usd dominance. 
But, that's just crazy talk... Right? 
**Edit**: Seriously though, I don't think the dollar will collapse for a while, the powers that be are too dependent on it.

There are plenty of great solutions in the world of crypto, one time password USB keys, hardware wallets which keep your information safe and easy to use, and so many more. The issue is not in the use of these systems, it's that most companies aren't implementing them. 
Not that I blame them, it would be difficult to choose from the massive array of solutions given the expense and training for employees involved. 
Yes people lose things, no that isn't an issue when properly implemented. The old way of "just take my word for it, I'm who I say I am" is easy I agree. But I don't want it to be easy to break. 
We need to accept some degree of responsibility for our own security.

[Not in its current form]( The pound was a gold backed currency, not a [fiat currency]( And it *definitely* wasn't a reserve currency for that long. Fiat does not mean paper money, or money run by the government. It means that a central issuer, generally a government, issues a certain amount of paper notes and promises not to print them in excess.
If you are trying to say that a **fiat currency**, specifically a fiat **reserve currency** denominated by a central issuer, can be stable beyond ~110 years. Please find some real sources.

They should just put 1 bitcoin and one ounce of gold in escrow or give it to a trusted 3rd party. Winner take all, that's a decent bet. Shiff buys the bitcoin and amagi buys the gold. Winner gets what they want.
**Edit**: does make a good point:


He is correct that the bet is cheaper for the goldbug than the bitcoiner. I have a feeling that quite a few bitcoiners would take that bet anyway (myself included). If Shiff asked me I would totally make that bet.

It's almost like you should know that, and not store your entire fortune in that wallet!
Wait... there is another technology like that... I can't remember what it's called... people call it volatile and dangerous... they say you shouldn't put all your money into it... oh yeah! Bitcoin.
So little companies make mistakes and undermine trust. Not everyone can hit a home run every time. Reassuring? Who says they have to be reassuring? This is bitcoin, nothing is supposed to be reassuring, this is the birth of a new technology.
There is an allegory I once heard, "A man is called into the CEO's office, he had lost the company $100k as a result of his mistake. The man tries to hand the CEO his resignation. CEO, "FIRED!? Hell I just spent $100k training you! Just don't make the same mistake again!""

Because using escrow, trading trivial amounts to see if your partner is trustworthy, and meeting in a friendly place is for chumps right?

I rewatched the video (I hadn't watched it in a long time) and I realize that it only glossed over Austrian economics. Austrian economics is based on the idea that saving a commodity like gold or a gold backed currency is good for the economy. That people can make proper decisions for themselves etc.
Like the video discusses, this is not always the right thing to do and can create havoc (deflation). This is explained away by Austrians stating that fiat inflation only ends up making this cycle worse. And as I have previously stated, historically this has been the case.
I would prefer a cryptocurrency which has a set inflation rate or even better, a basket of cryptocurrencies which have several set inflation rates to encourage spending and trade. Anything to lessen the boom and bust cycle from being harsh on the pouace. I think this would go together well with bitcoin or gold having boom and bust cycles because you could flee to a security which has a basically static value in times of great turmoil.

Even if you assume that you can pull off such a feat on paper, it would be INTENSELY obvious to the community that the ETF was overselling what it actually possessed. 
Bitcoins aren't like gold, you can't hide or lie about the amount you possess in a vault.  the supply is too limited to allow a large amount of hidden activity, and  I'm pretty sure they will have to disclose the number of bitcoins they have on their books, so people will be able to figure out where they all are.

Don't forget that the long term for gold is thousands of years and hundreds of countries, empires, and warlords. 
Both bitcoin, and fiat, pale in comparison to gold's track record as a currency. 
example of the pound sterling is disingenuous at best. The gbp was a gold standard for the longest time and then they switched to being backed/pegged by **the usd** in 1940. And we all know what happened to the usd after 1940.
300 years of having the same name does not make it a long term successful currency.

**I will bet you 2 bitcoins that we reach $5k a bitcoin by the end of 2015**. This is a legit offer to **No joke**.
If you need fiat, I am willing to put up $1200 usd as well.
I would put up more bitcoins but I have a feeling you want the fiat. I don't have that much fiat to risk because I am saving for a house.

I do believe that you would pay the highest capital gains tax available for holding bitcoin for less than a year before you sell. 
As others have said, you could make money and you could lose it. Bitcoin is volatile and depending on where you invest there can be additional security risks.

You think that one of the most valuable exchanges on the planet just grinds to a halt and one guy is responsible? You think that the billions of dollars lost each hour is cheaper than simply making a redundant system? You think they don't know what is wrong within minutes?

Yeah, you **are** making assumptions.

Not really OP. I'm glad you feel it, that gives me hope, but I've ridden two booms. A few hundred dollars isn't much percentage wise. 
I need to feel the adrenaline flow. I need to watch charts and feel destiny unfold. I need to feel the delusion of the masses panic buying, and panic selling. 
Personally I would like to see more sideways movement right now because the volume, and on balance volume is so lackluster. Take a look at bitcoincharts.com and look at the two year chart. Look at the volume compared to the last few weeks. Open the technical indicator dropdowns, and select the OBV. It how much money is currently at the exchange (kinda). Try looking at this rise when ticking 'log scale', it's not as big as it seems. It actually seems to be pretty healthy so long as we don't go nuts.

Step 1: Take garbage from a dumpster or public bin. 
Step 2: Give garbage to kiosk. No work involved. 
Step 3:  Repeat. 
Step 4: Profit. 
There's a million ways to be dishonest with this idea unfortunately. Also, you would probably end up paying homeless people less than minimum wage to do these dishonest things just to try and make money a little faster. 
I love the concept but I have no idea how you would combat the reality of "Is this 'new' trash?" How do you prove trash is the 'right' trash you want picked up? If people just take the trash from their homes to these kiosks, how do you tell if it came from their home?

I used to be a Localbitcoins seller until things got weird regulation wise here in the US. I loved meeting people, I taught them how to use escrow and how to store their bitcoins safely. It was lots of fun meeting local techies. If I lived in a high crime area I would worry but even then escrow makes it pretty hard for the seller to run off with everything. It's actually more risk for the seller once they put their coins in escrow. The buyer can claim that they already paid for the coins and try to win the arbitration in their favor.

~~No, you have to wait the full week.~~ Keep in mind that banks are not happy about what you are doing, and make no mistake the powers that be are watching us closely.
If you don't mind my asking, why are you in such a rush to get your coins? I know it is annoying to have to wait, but the price you bought the coins for gets locked in the moment you buy them. Are you worried about them falling in value in under a week? Because if you are then I suggest that you not purchase bitcoins. Bitcoins are an extremely volatile market and you should be prepared to lose every dollar you put in.
I love Coinbase, I have purchased a large number of coins from them and I have always received my purchase. I do wish they would up their $100USD limit though.
Edit: I see that you have waited the full week, I will be monitoring this thread now.

Powerpoint is king when it comes to text, video, and picture presentations. But I prefer OpenOffice or LibreOffice because they are free.
Powerpoint howto [here]( and [here](
OpenOffice video tutorial [here](
With the OpenOffice method you export the presentation as a .swf file which is ready for youtube use! You can edit the file and set it to music just like a regular video clip.
With both methods you can add a large variety of media formats and they are both very well documented.
No need to be good with art, just use google! If you are worried about licencing issues, just find media with [a Creative Commons licence]( Most of the time all you need to do is include them in the credits or give reference to who originally made the media.

The $100 is a per day limit, and your price is locked in the moment you click buy. I have purchased a large number of bitcoins in this manner, and I love the low fees and ease of use.
They have 2 factor authentication and their passwords do not have limits(within reason). While it takes ~7 days (sometimes sooner) for your bank transfer to complete, I consider this an acceptable trade off because of how amazingly easy it is to purchase bitcoins.
The only thing I wish they would change is the $100 limit. As the price of bitcoins rise, the limit is becoming more and more restrictive. I understand *why* they are doing it, but I wish my proven track record of payment would allow me to increase my limit :/
@_date: 2012-11-01 23:59:47

First of all, I liked the video.
BUT, I read REALLY fast(~290WPM), and I found the background color and text scrolling to be really... ugly/annoying/aggravating. If you use text in a video you will need to keep it on the screen for a while, most people read slowly(Ever hear someone say they hate forigen movies because of subtitles?). Powerpoint presentation styles would apply if you must put text into a video.
Also, the music was a little bit intense. I realize your target audience tends to like this kind of music (I did), but I would try to cast as wide a net as possible. The more people who can read your message and enjoy the content of your video the better.

My coins, the ones I keep on the coinbase site, are right where they are supposed to be. I also transfer them out to my personal wallet regularly. I don't keep more than $20 worth of coins on their site just for that reason.
You also can't buy coins from BlockChain.info, it's just an online wallet.

If you have never done a wire transfer you will be surprised how easy it is. I know that either method incurs fees, but all money exchanges into foreign currencies have some of fees. I know that you want to get these coins fast for Christmas but when you are trying to move cash fast it takes a little extra effort. PayPal has explicit rules against purchasing items like bitcoin, which is why you have to find someone willing to stick their neck out to make a personal transaction. 
PS I believe that the insurance fees for registered mail change for the declared value of the package. If you are sending a small amount, the fees will probably be low.

You mean the 12k people who are reading this subforum for bitcoin news? While litecoin is a cryptocurrency and lots of currencies are discussed here, the downvotes are understandable considering that litecoin is a rival. I would wager that a large percentage of the 12K subscribers have some bitcoins they have purchased. Why would any of them want to support a rival?
Not to mention, that if you truly believed that litecoin was going to rise in price then the current ~$.08 asking price is chump change to buy in. For $20USD you could get 250 of them. Why bother mining? My electricity costs more.

Actually, I agree. If people actually *use* it, then this will be a **HUGE** pr boost.
Put it this way:
Lets say you have $10USD a month you would like to help promote bitcoin with.
If you tip $.15USD **15 TIMES A WEEK** it will be $9USD every 4 weeks.
So that is 60 of these **highly visable** tips a month. This is like Google ads on crack, but for bitcoins.
If just 10 people donate just $10USD a month, there will be **600** comments a month in all of the major subreddits.
**HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.**
TLDR: If you like bitcoin, use this as much as possible.

I don't care if 'we' get get rich, I just want Bitcoin to be adopted as a real currency. Wouldn't an artificial floor entail mass acceptance and stability (maybe/hopefully)? For me the end goal, which I care about, is fixing the problem of the current monetary system. I don't care to win some kind of crazy penny stock scheme/lottery. I am much more interested in what it will do for the world economy and the issuance of debt.
Winning the Bitcoin lottery couldn't hurt though :P
You are right about the artificial floor, but I would think it would probably be natural and not artificial because of market forces keeping speculators worried about exchange value. Bubbles don't last forever. And you are right, it would be a bubble.
I would hope that the 'pop' wouldn't scare too many people off. But hey, what can you do?

I thought there were more services to transfer bitcoin with a single dumbphone, but I can only find [localbitcoins.com]( I agree though, I think bitcoin will have an even tougher time trying to get accepted in low tech countries.
@_date: 2012-11-01 23:19:38
I use this and it is not as fast as some of the other services, but I like the ease of use. 
I don't have a lot of time to do errands, and going to the bank/7-11/Wallmart/etc. is really tough to do sometimes. The fees are ~1% and I just consider the wait time a savings in fees (~5% for bitinstant).
@_date: 2012-11-19 07:09:14
Ok, I have to call bs. There is no way that my 30 Bitcoins are going to be worth $5,467,500 USD in 2024. I am in this for the long haul and I believe the coins might be worth ~$100k in the future, but untold riches!? I get what you mean by a world market cap, but how in the world would my measly savings be worth that much!?
Even if it came true it would boggle my mind as to how I obtained that much wealth. I mean, at least I understand the state lottery. But I would have to hire someone just to explain the economics of it to me.
TLDR: No fucking way.
PS I say all of this while laughing and imagining what I would do with 5 million dollars. Thanks for the fun daydream.

Sending cash in the mail is a bad idea, envelopes break all the time and there are no guarantees with the cash you send. [Registered mail]( is a much better option if you need to send cash in the mail, you can even have it insured. Regular mail has no such guarantees. Depending on the amount of money you send these types of guarantees might be a wise idea. $5k USD of insurance is only $11.

So, is the point moot because you can get the client from a torrent, other source, or thorough a VPN? I don't think downloading the blockchain through tor is a viable option though.
Personally I use offline storage for my coins, but I don't move them that much. Even if you did traded with paper wallets, (not a real option) wouldn't the deflation of bitcoin be a hazard and not a benefit? 
I would love for bitcoin to take hold in a place like this, but this seems like there are a lot of obstacles for bitcoin adoption to be a real alternative.

Like labestoil said, you are underestimating the amount of money some people have.
You are right, no one in  their right mind would invest 100% of their funds. But if someone with a billion dollars  invested 5 **Million** dollars into the bitcoin economy, they would have only invested 0.5% of their total wealth into a high capacity investment ([There are currently an estimated 1210 billionaires worldwide](
How small is 0.5% ? lets say you had $10k in the bank and you wanted to invest an equivalent amount. $50. That is right, **FIFTY BUCKS!**
More money than God.

I agree, why would someone want to bet on a virtual currency which is accepted less than bitcoin? It is hard enough to get bitcoin accepted by the general populace, why would anyone try to fight its momentum?
I agree that litecoin is the same as bitcoin in a lot of ways, but if you were to pick a currency to invest your money in would you pick the weak litecoin or the strong bitcoin?
Let's put it another way, if you had the ability to purchase USD or Mexican pesos which would you pick(not endorsing USD or hating on pesos)? You would pick the perceived strongest currency. They both have merits, but you know that the USD is the stronger of the two, so you pick the USD.
There is no contest. Bitcoin has already won the battle on the internet, it only needs to take on the real world.

I actually stared at the charts for a reeeeeeeeelly long time and thought about it really hard, and I think I got a hang of them now (still don't know what they are called though. Money exchange charts?).
From what I understand someone wanted to sell 35K Bitcoins @ $5.20, which would normally freak everyone out because they would think the seller knew something they didn't. He would want to sell because he felt the Bitcoin was a poor investment and he wanted to exchange his Bitcoins for dollars because he felt the dollar was a better investment.
But another guy came along and said, "I think this is a **great** exchange point, there is **no way** the exchange point will fall much more than $5.19! I want in NOW!" and he put up a buy order for 17.5k Bitcoins @ $5.19, at which point he said, "Now I dare you to tell me this is a good price point to exchange for dollars at!"
Although this could also be a ploy (by the guy who wanted to sell) to send the trading point down further, and allow him to buy more Bitcoins at a lower price. Eg: Bitcoins fall to $2 because of his giant order, and he can now buy them at the much reduced exchange rate of $2. But I think his plan was interrupted by the guy who was asking for 17.5k Bitcoins @ $5.19 (don't quote me, I'm just a guy with a HS diploma).
But this could be all part of some master plan to manipulate the market which I am waaay to stupid to understand. :P
But we now know the seller was right to get out, the current price at the time of this writing is $4.38. So the guy who was buying is now currently holding onto 17.5k Bitcoins @ $5.19 (if he didn't cancel his order) until the market hopefully rises. :)
I hope that helps someone!

I agree, but places like [Bees Brothers]( and [Survival Food]( will do well as long as they have competitive prices (those 2 do). They sell value added food which keeps for long periods of time, so it doesn't matter that there is a wait time for the product.
And not that anyone cares, but in the next few years I am planning on buying some property and starting a farm. I plan on selling anything and everything I produce (wool, cheese, veggies, bamboo, etc.) And I see no reason I shouldn't accept bitcoin as a form of payment on my website. I might not feel comfortable keeping all of my profits in bitcoins at the moment, but I look forward to having my mind changed in the near future. :)

Depends on how many you want. If you just want to posses a fraction of a bitcoin [this is a pretty good list of ways to get some]( But if you would like to purchase some, the link over there ---&gt; titled 'Getting Started' is a great way to learn everything you need to know about bitcoin.
Personally I suggest [Coinbase]( as the best way to purchase your coins. They may be slow compared to other methods, but they are SOOO easy to use. It is just like using paypal to verify your bank account, if you have ever done that. Other methods have you make a cash deposit via a moneygram like service which is a bit complicated and annoying.
**PS** If you like other services I mean no offense. I just hated the song and dance I had to perform to get my BTC. I am a busy person, and taking an entire day to make a specific errand to goto CVS or a bank was amazingly frustrating and annoying.

So we are safe, but we should be cautious. Is that what this is trying to say?

1. I find bitcoin to be the easiest payment system on the Internet. The hardest part is the initial exchange. But I consider this a non-issue because this is the same for *any* currency exchange. Once you have the desired amount for your purchase the transactions are flawless, secure, and better than cash.
2. This is for you to decide. Just like any investment, the risk assessment is left in the hands of the investor. If you want an unbiased opinion, you won't find one here :P That is like asking a realtor if you should invest in property. Personally I think the future of bitcoin is extremely risky but, having said that, I have a number of bitcoins because I think it is a risk worth taking.
3. This is really a question which has been answered **everywhere**. In videos, on forums, and in this subreddit. Just start poking around and you will see what people think of bitcoin.

Assuming QC "suddenly" appears, and ECDSA is instantaneously crackable using Shor's algorithm, and SHA256/RIPEMD160 become vulnerable to Grover's algorithm:
* Every unspent coin, sent to an address whose pubkey is not yet revealed, is somewhat safe (80 bit security left, instead of 160 bit)
* The block chain is quite safe (128 bit security left, instead of 256 bit)
* Transactions to new quantum-computing-based addresses with corresponding keys, are safe
* ... only unspent coins sent to reused addresses will be trivially claimable by any attacker (a few bits of security left, instead of 128 bit)

Because someone asked to be educated they should be brushed off? What crazy logic is this!? Should I tell kids who ask me stupid questions to 'just figure it out.'
Besides, this is where people come to ask questions and learn about bitcoins in general. Why should we discourage people? If this question was on the sidebar I would agree with your stance, but it is not. This person has a well thought out question which is pertinent to the general public. What happens if someone searches for this question in the future? They will ask it again because no one in this thread bothered to answer the question honestly!

It is a long time, but I find it really hard to swallow that I will be a millionaire in that span of time.
You are telling me that my investment of ~$300 is going to grow 18,225% in 12 years. Even [Apple's growth over the last ten years is only around 6000%]( Apples market cap is $496.4B).
It's not that I don't believe what you are proposing isn't possible, just highly improbable. Quite to the contrary, I hope you are right and I am rich beyond my wildest dreams. For some context I don't even expect my college degree to have a 20% return in the same amount of time.
BTW Warren Buffet has a cool quote in that article, "If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes." Totally relates to what we are talking about.
PS I am willing to give you 1 million of my future money if you loan me $30k right now. :D
Edit: Man college is a rip...
Edit2: If I cash out in 2024 then I am making $156 dollars an hour right now.... So you are here from the future to make me buy more coins right?

If two retards can't even ask for a pin number, what makes you think they will have the wherewithal to chop off someone's finger?
I get what you are saying, I'm sure there will be assholes who do just that. I am just saying that I find it hard to believe that the majority will become that violent and/or have the smarts to stop and figure out which finger opens your device.
If the majority of people keep $20-$200 on their phones, do you really think that the average thief is going to do something that drastic?
I am aware that people stab, shoot, and rape while they do their crimes. But violent crimes are not as popular as non-violent ones. And low value crime has a lower incidence of violence than high value crime. So unless you are keeping thousands of dollars on your phone, I highly doubt that someone will kill you for it.

If you could pull 1/4 of that every day consistently, you would be a stock market god.
Assuming .3125% and a 365 day money making year:
You could turn $1000 into ~$88 million in 10 years using no leverage.
In 15 years you would have ~$26 billion
In 20 years you would have ~$7.8 Trillion
In 23 years you would surpass the [estimated GDP of the earth]( and round ~$238 trillion
Not bad for .3125% interest. (Fuck I wish I could make just 25 pips a day)

 Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear about my hypothetical situation. I meant ask about the durability of the sticker. Like: What if I accidentally step on it, or if I leave one in my pants and it goes through the washer/dryer will it be ok? If I have a pocket full of them, will they rub off each other's stickers? A dollar bill/regular coin can take a lot of abuse like that. I also question the idea of an adhesive sticking to my coin for long periods of time. I have had holograms fall apart for no reason (think cheap children's stickers).
Don't get me wrong, I have no problem taking good care of something. I just want a coin to be as durable as well... a coin!

It's hard for outsiders to understand when bitcoiners say they are waiting for $50k-$100k bitcoins. But some of us are here for the long haul. 
We are essentially waiting for the adoption rate to be as big as Visa or Mastercard. When that happens the current 7 billion dollar market cap will look pitiful. 
7 billion sounds like a lot but twitter's market cap is 25 billion, and visa's is 190 billion. 
What I am getting at is that people aren't selling because they believe that bitcoin will be much larger than it currently is. They believe enough to risk tens of thousands of dollars for years on end. 
I'm not asking you to believe, you just asked why they aren't selling. They believe that they are the future.  
@_date: 2015-11-21 20:43:12

I might change my opinion if BTCjam released a third party financial review of their customers ROI rates. But lol, that's what a legitimate company would do. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 21:00:54
Everyone is recommending Coinbase, but since your source of bitcoins may be deemed 'illegitimate' by the banking system, I think you should know that Coinbase is a bank. 
I personally love Coinbase, but I also know they would close my account if I sent money to a darkweb drug store. 
I am unsure about the specific Coinbase policies regarding the 'cleanliness' of the money which is transmitted through their bank. But I know they are beholden to AML rules governing banks in the US. Please be cautious. 
Local bitcoins will connect you with people willing to trade in cash though. Just use the escrow system until you feel comfortable with your contacts.

Neither, all money is money. I am simply stating that it is a personal choice to accept "tainted" money.
Evil is in the eye of the beholder. (Or in the eye of the law in your particular country.)
Currency is a tool which can be used for right or wrong. This particular tool takes two people to make use of it. They can either choose to participate or choose not to. 
You are trying to give moral attributes to a morally neutral tool.

By all means, play the market, that is why there are trading websites. Trading provides stability.
But don't forget that people once thought that $400 bitcoins were insane and that they couldn't possibly go higher.

How can these obviously intelligent people say such stupid things!? 
It's insanely obvious that you need to assign a value to the tokens to secure the blockchain. Maybe it took a genius to produce this obvious revelation but it's now almost common knowledge.

@_date: 2015-11-05 00:36:53
I'm not sure you understood what I was trying to get at. I don't understand where you got the idea that I was claiming gold was a functional everyday transactional currency.
As far as I am aware people still use gold for a variety of things. I didn't claim anything other than that gold still had value's and uses.
Comparing the core functionality of gold to fiat is as relational as comparing fiat to bitcoin. They have parallels and dissimilarities.
I'm not even sure what *you* are getting at. Can you please clarify?
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:21:37
Lol, you are missing the point of making money then. I'm not buying it because I love the government, I'm buying it because the masses would also buy it. People trust what they know, and they know the government. 
People want in on the bitcoin ride but they are afraid of "the shadowy creator!" The government coin solves that issue for the doubters like Bernanke. 
Of course a centralized coin is useless, that's not the point. The point is that statists love the perceived security of the state.

I guess they would auction them off to banks like they do with bonds... Securing the blockchain would be wicked fun to watch the chaos. I wonder which country would be next...

Worked just fine! It just took a minute. \^.^
Yeah mycelium is great for most things but being secure with bitcoin can be very challenging for new users. 
Personally I use my mycelium wallet for my everyday use and I use an offline paper wallet to store the rest. This helps me sleep at night knowing that attackers  would have to break bitcoin before they could get my offline wallet. In which case the bitcoins are useless anyway! 
Mycelium makes it a snap to back up to paper and send p2p. If you are looking for a computer/desktop wallet I recommend Electrum or Armory. They are easy to use and they don't require hours of blockchain downloading. 
If you want to keep bitcoins as an investment,  I highly recommend learning how to use 2 factor authentication with services like Coinbase. Google authenticator is pretty good for this purpose. But you need to back up your shared secret somewhere in case your phone/tablet kicks the bucket. 2 factor authentication can be crucial if an attacker has taken your password. They still need your device to access your account. Look into this. 
I also recommend learning how to use a "live cd" if you generate offline wallets. A live cd is an operating system on a cd which "forgets" everything you did with it. This is important when creating an offline wallet because you can "air gap" everything between you and the internet attackers. Attackers can't steal what they can't see, and they can't see an air gapped computer.
Sorry if the world of bitcoin is overwhelming, keep in mind that bitcoin is still beta software! You have entered a world still under development and we leave dust everywhere! Bitcoin is an experiment, please treat it as such when considering any service or information you encounter. Use caution because it's also the wild west! Stagecoach robberies happen if you are caught unprepared! 
But bitcoin is lots of fun if you approach it with the right attitude. I am always glad to share my hobby with new people, so please feel free to ask me lots of questions. I may take a bit to get back to you but I promise I will.
I am glad to hear that you find all of this interesting :)

I truly don't understand how people think this is anything like CoinValidation. People simply aren't accepting money they know is stolen/tainted. 
This is like if you saw someone get robbed, and then the robber tried to buy some goods from you with the cash you saw him steal. It's not that you are 'validating' the fiat, you are simply choosing not to do business with that person. That crook can either wash his money or he has to find someone who *will* do business with him.
I don't understand this idea that people have that others should be forced to accept their money. If someone wants to refuse your business, for any reason under the sun, why would force be the answer?

Except if the way the usd was "dethroned" was a massive trade war which put them on the losing end. You are assuming that the current economic system would be transfered peacefully to another currency, and the usd would just fail to be the strongest.
Historically when currencies go through this phase their countries are at war. And when countries are at war (cold or otherwise) the people are geared up (wisely in my opinion) to inflate their currencies faster than everyone else. If they don't, their enemies will outgrow them by default.
Inflation is a tool to be sure, but it's subject to the pitfalls of any other tool. It can be used for good or evil. And it can be productive or destructive.
To say that inflation is harmless is naive at best.
It's not like we haven't lost our heads about economics before, what makes you think we are more wise now? The laws are just as bad and the system is basically the same.

... So you are claiming that banks can't do exactly what they did to OP? ... I'm not sure I can wrap my brain around that.


Except that neither bank is forking over the record of the second transaction. You will have to talk to a lawyer first, and then subpoena the banks for the actual record. A blockchain record is public and you can prove it instantaneously. Period. You just call the cops and tell them which bank stole from you.


I wouldn't call getting a lawyer involved in a simple monthly payment mix-up "inconvenient." I would call if fucking expensive, stupid, and completely unnecessary.


I have absolutely no idea what this obvious straw man has to do with my original comment but I can play ball if you like.
So we shouldn't use cash, gold, gas, food, or anything else which can be stolen and not recovered? Because that is just nonsense.
Are you trying to say that reversible transactions have their place? Well duh. But it's not like you can't refund *legitimate purchases* in any currency on the planet. The only difference with reversible transactions is that you are *pulling money out of someone's account instead of creating a new transaction*.
Reversing transactions does not mean you can pull funds from a scammer's account, most of the time they have already made off with the funds. Reversible transactions only work when the other party is being honest and hasn't made off with the cash/goods. You can't reverse what **isn't there**. Why do you think there are billions of dollars in CC fraud every year?
Bitcoin has a purpose, and it works for that purpose extremely well. Bitcoin isn't a miracle, some tools work better for some purposes than others. You don't only use a hammer to put together a skyscraper do you?
Would I take a loan in btc? Fuck no.
Would I use bitcoin as my primary savings vehicle? Fuck no.
Would I keep all my funds for a trip to Europe in btc? Fuck no.
Would I use btc to transfer money? Yes.
Would I use it to pay bills denominated in fiat? Yes.
Would I use a Coinbase account to keep usd savings, and use the stability of fiat to my advantage? Yes.
If you want to troll me on bitcoin, you are going to have to learn a bit more about it. There are plenty of great arguments against bitcoin. "Muh reversible transactions!" is not one of those arguments.

An economic movement of this magnitude would collapse millions of pension plans, bankrupt hundreds of enterprises, and be on par with the great depression.
This has nothing to do with the government.
The current world economic system is based on the US dollar's supremacy. Banks all over the globe use it to stabilize their own currency. Lending rates around the world are set by US monetary policy. Loans are made based on the stability of world markets.
If bitcoin made an **unexpected meteoritic rise**, markets around the world would crumble. FDIC insurance would mean nothing, bank runs would yield empty paper. The public would be in disarray and supermarket shelves would be bare.
Grandma's who had all their savings in US bonds would be bankrupt. Families who kept their savings in a coffee can wouldn't have money to buy food.
Of course everything would eventually normalize but the interim would be chaos and the public would want to hold something responsible.
Bitcoin is no more freedom than a gold coin. There will always be debt, loans have existed for as long as money has. Bitcoin is not a silver bullet, even if it became a dominant currency it would not affect the average person's life all that much.
If gold backed currencies, or their like, really provided that much of a benefit to the average person, they would be seen in more places. We see exactly 0 nations using them.
I too think that fiat money has eroded purchasing power and personal sovereignty. But how much will we *really* change things? The governments won't change. The banks won't change. The military won't change. They will all work exactly as before but without fiat money. You will simply take away one of their many tools.
The average person on the other hand, will have had to endure intense strife. Fortunately for the poorest it won't be that much of a difference, but for the average North American or European, it will have been something for the history books.
Bitcoin won't stick it to the man, the wealthy will ride out any waves we make on their massive yachts. They will ponder what to eat for brunch and sip their drinks.
I have faith in bitcoin but I don't know what to make of it.

First off I want to say that I have no issues with any crypto which is not a scam. I welcome all cryptocurrency development in any form so long as it is a legitimate effort to add to the pool of knowledge.
Second of all... I've taken dogecoin a bit more seriously lately but it is **SO GOD DAMN HARD TO LEARN ABOUT SERIOUSLY**!!
I love the doge meme so I feel confident when I say that dogecoin websites bug the shit out of me. I just want to learn about the serious aspects of the cryptocurrency without having to dig though entire websites worth of nonsense. It drives me insane and is the major reason I have not bought any dogecoin.
Having said that, [I found this blog]( which had a great analysis of dogecoin because your comment prompted me to increase my knowledge. But because it is so hard for me to find serious talk about dogecoin, I still don't trust putting my money into the system. I really, really want to take doge seriously but I just can't take it seriously when ***EVERYONE***, *including the dogecoiners*, is telling me not to!
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:03:17
I understand some bitcoiners want to live completely disparate from the state, but I don't see bitcoin completely wiping out fiat. That is like saying fiat wiped out gold, it was superior no doubt, but it didn't replace its functionality.
You also have to let people come to this realization on their own, assailing them with, "Fiat is lame!!!" Is a very difficult concept to understand when you didn't even understand what the concept of 'money' is. Your average person just uses fiat and credit cards without ever understanding the forces which drive their value. These ideas are not trivial when understanding bitcoin.
I know ***I*** didn't understand when people told me that bitcoins could be worth a million dollars. (I thought they were just overly excited about their potential.) I knew gold's value was derived from its scarcity, but I didn't understand how a scarce internet dollar could be worth so much. I am sure the price of a bitcoin seems *wildly inflated* to the average person.
If the value of a single bitcoin seems too high, how do you expect them to understand that you believe the bulk of global trade will be conducted in bitcoin instead of US dollars? It seems absolutely absurd that some eccentric guy in a basement could disrupt global trade and international politics. You just sound like a nutcase.
Help people understand the concepts behind your reasoning. If you tell them you believe you will be rich, that peaks their interest, just like in the above conversation.

Except that, historically speaking, countries fall into economic disarray BEFORE large wars. The wars are usually a symptom of not being able to pay debts or gain access to resources peacefully. There are plenty of countries that had their currency fall into hyperinflation without catastrophic war.

I would only consider it cheating if you kept the project funds (let's say $600 for two weeks) in gift cards instead of bitcoin. 
So long as you are only buying gift cards at the time of usage, it's more like exchanging money in a foreign country than holding onto a bunch of gift cards. 
Personally, I would consider the challenge to be *holding* your initial capital in bitcoin. Bitcoin swings so violently that this could be a real issue.

First of all, thank you for not getting angry at me for having a different worldview than you. Some people are taking offense about what I want to do, and I really did not mean to upset anyone. :(


This is a perfect paragraph for me to reply to. I don't wish to fall off the map, quite to the contrary, I hope I make enough money from my business venture so that I can travel the world and meet as many new people as possible. I don't reject society, I want to be independent from it if I so choose.
I get that this life is not for everyone, I didn't mean to make it sound like everyone should take up pitchforks and buy a cattle ranch XD
I just wanted to point out that our society is having a lot of trouble and that a lot of us are 'overwhelmed.'
Things like social security, banks, and a huge deficit are making huge problems which need to be acted upon. And our politicians are at a standstill.
The only thing *I can see* for someone to do on a personal level is to distance themselves from the usd and try and keep assets of some kind. This is not to say that there are not other options or views on the current political climate, I just know what is right for me and I share it hoping that others might benefit from the knowledge.


I totally agree. I have found my calling and I hope to be wildly successful. I hope that I can contribute in many ways, and that I can leverage my success to help others.

You can also have them give you some usd and some btc for every transaction, so you can decide how much fiat or btc you receive from your btc transactions. You can set the price in usd and they will automatically keep track of the exchange price for you.
All the safety of bitcoins without having to be a holder of bitcoins. All for a 1% fee (the bank transfers actually cost more than the service itself).

I agree wholeheartedly, the only thing I would add is that I think a 'silver' (not ltc) will emerge. I think it will have... Wait for it... Inflationary properties! I think that there is a market for a STABLE form of fiat currency. Not one which is printed by a government for its own ends, but a currency which inflates itself and encourages growth.
However, I think it would still be decentralized. Part of the attraction of a cryptocurrency is the fact that no one entity controls it. Why would anyone put their faith in a state when they have failed us so many times before!?
I also think that fiat won't totally disappear. Like snail mail, it will still have uses.

For the most part we are pretty friendly, but just like any reddit community, if you haven't read everything on the sidebar you're gonna have a bad time. 
But seriously, bitcoins aren't super hard to use. If you have a smartphone, download the blockchain wallet and give it a whirl. Just don't ever keep more than you would keep in your real life wallet in a web based wallet. You wouldn't walk around with your life's savings in fiat in your pocket would you? At least I hope not. 
Look into paper wallets, brain wallets, and wallets like Armory. The more you know about wallets, the safer your money will be. 
Lastly, when moving large balances... SEND A SMALL TEST AMOUNT FIRST!!
I hope that helps :)

[How I feel about all of this](
@_date: 2013-01-20 00:26:24
How many people would have to buy in for that figure to be reached? 
A quick visit to the Wikipedia page tells me that there are about ~127million people living in japan, and that they posses [about ~$100k-$200kUSD worth of savings](
So lets use $150k for our average. That is approx $150k*127million people. 
So approx. ~$19trillion dollars. So 19trillion*.001 is 19 billion dollars.
19 Billion in bitcoins? Sounds like a dream within a dream to me. Also, it would take a lot less to make bitcoin much bigger.
As it currently stands it would only take about 1millionUSD to make the price soar to $30. That is approx 134 people dropping $7,500 (or 5% of our average 150k in savings) into the bitcoin market.
So... Yeah it is probably more like .0001%
We are in the minority. This all sounds a little too far out there as of today.

The bitcointip bot takes care of all of that for you. If you read [the documentation]( you will be able to find out how to transfer the funds I gave you. Right now the only thing keeping your wallet safe is your reddit password because the bot will only accept commands from your account. However since the amount is small, the risk is small and someone would have to break into either reddit or your account to take your funds.
I believe that the tipbot is keeping your private key at this point. It created one for you when I tipped you. The only thing you need to do is [sign up for the bot and follow some directions]( You can withdraw the funds to a blockchain wallet or the like. Or you can keep it in the tipbot for now.
If you would like to send the coin back then you would have to sign up for the bot, accept the tip and then tip me back. Alternately, you can just leave it and after ~20 days or so I will receive the amount back automatically.
And no problem, the tip bot is kind of confusing at first. But just like reddit, once you learn how to use it, it kicks ass. :)

Trash it? Blockchain doesn't care if you empty it and just leave it. You can make as many as you want, and I would encourage you to do so. Attackers have a tough time trying to attack a moving target.
But if you are interested in *using* bitcoin, I would encourage you to keep your blockchain wallet with a SMALL amount of funds in it. Think of it like your physical wallet. You wouldn't carry more than a few hundred in your pocket normally right? You could get held up!
Only ever keep funds in a 'hot' wallet which you are either about to use/move or you are *sure* that it is safe(livecd, Armory wallet, etc.). Personally I'm a fan of paper wallets though, they are practically invincible if they are **used correctly**(aka 'use your head').

I am sure that there are many other such situations, and they could use a service like [bitpay]( to cash out in usd immediately if they aren't to sure about bitcoins yet. Although they might warm up to the idea quick if people start paying them with btc.

Some questions if you happen to know the answers. It seems like you have done more research than me.
1. Why don't banks/millionaires just buy silver now? It's not like it will cost them any real portion of their wealth.
2. Why can't mining giants just turn their equipment to silver instead of other precious metals and make huge stockpiles in a relatively short time?
3. Who is to say this guy isn't just trying to make his silver stockpile worth more?

Yep, I am purchasing a ranch and I will be making enough money to pay off the property taxes and incidentals.
I hope to make more, but if I never made a dime other than covering my expenses I would be happy.
I love being outside, I love growing my own food, and I love making my own stuff. I have a computer to bring me media, books, and more. What more do you want? Jets? Yachts? Drugs? Fuck that shit. I would be happy just floating on a lake and fishing up a storm. Rock climbing, programming, building whatever, and a million other cheap/free things.
I **never** get to read my books, spend time with my friends, **see the SUN** (I work in a TV station late at night and I sleep during the day), or make/do any of the projects I have been putting off for so long.
I don't need millions to be happy, just about $30-$50k would freaking rock. If I got that, I would never have to keep usd, other than to pay my bills, again. Silver, gold, btc, and real goods like the timber or cattle I can grow on my property. All assets. I want my freedom back.
Fuck fiat, go to hell usd. I have had enough of the government stealing from me and my family through inflation.
I just don't want to be a slave to my job anymore, my life is waiting for me.
Unless the government starts taxing sun, water, air, and soil I will do just fine.

Disclaimer: I am just some guy with an opinion on the interwebz.
However, I would buy sooner than later because I feel that there are going to be articles along the lines of "Bitcoin, back from the dead?" in some major magazines. I believe this because once the all time high is breached, major tech writers will not be able to ignore the changes in the Bitcoin market. They will have to say something, good or bad.
Once this happens, I believe the price will spike through the roof again due the renewed press. Crash? Inevitably. But this may be the lowest the price for some time to come or perhaps forever.
Will they stabilize after that? Only the market knows the answer.
Never invest more than you can safely afford to lose.

Having an item for self defense and having things stolen from you are two different things. Bringing an item for self defense won't help if someone tries for a smash and grab. 
It's not like you are within your rights to forcibly defend your property. 
I am saying that you must be going to strange places if you fear for your bodily safety. I am not daft, I understand that people can still steal from you. 
If someone tries to take money from you with the threat of harm, for Gods sake give it to them. Your life has immeasurable value. 
All I am saying is that most likely a self defense weapon would only make that kind of situation worse. Unless they pull a gun in which case you better hope you are faster than them. A knife wouldn't do anything more than piss your attacker off. 95% of people don't have a clue as to how to use a knife to inflict harm on another person. A cell phone would be of much greater use in a public setting. 
Besides the fact that this is the UK and that there are no guns. The idea that a 13 year old would win a knife fight with a full grown man who could possibly have buddies is totally outrageous. 
I am all for self defense, just use your most deadly weapon first. Your brain. 
Edit: If I had to choose a weapon for self defense in case the attacker had a knife, I would choose a bat or similar weapon with a greater reach than the knife. But I say again, most likely you will end up worsening the situation. You would need practice with your weapon of choice to be any good and we are still talking about a 13 year old boy. Running is the best option in a public place.

I was on a phone and I guess I shortened it too much.
I meant that I saw the situation with the 'manual bitcoin mining' differently. I see a man looking for a job where even a $1/hr would help him out. He wants a job because he would rather work for chump change than panhandle and have to deal with police and shame.
I am not sure how ethical this is but my initial feeling is that it is better to be paid almost nothing than to make nothing or do nothing.
I may not have a lot, but I would love to give someone a job if I could afford it. On the surface it seems practical, however it also seems like exploitation. I am not sure how I feel about the general idea.
As a libertarian I feel that the free market will help these people out but as a realist I also feel that this won't be an instant solution. Reality is more complex than, 'Look! I have a job for you!'

Are you kidding? If bitcoins are only ever used to buy drugs, as long as they aren't banned or the code is broken, I will continue to hold them. I consider a drug backed currency to be better than one backed by gold. No one is ever going to stop wanting drugs, people might stop wanting gold if we mine asteroids or something.

How much money do you throw away on a monthly basis? How many Starbucks, how many beers, and how many nights do you eat out?
Take a little of that money and invest. The [potential upside]( is definitely worth the downside of losing a few bucks. Just think of it as money you have already lost. Don't **ever** expect to get back a penny and don't ever expect to 'cash out'. Just hope you wake up one day **20-30 years** from now and you realize you have a nice retirement fund. You aren't a FOREX daytrader, you're just some guy (no offense). Buy and hold.
What were you doing with that money anyway? I have seen this question about people sitting on the fence more than a few times, and I am beyond puzzled by it.
Suppose you buy 2 coins at the record price of ~$49, according to the idea that we reach just 1% of the world currency market, your $100 would be worth ~$56,780. Do you think you can handle losing $100?
People keep getting scared about losing money, how much money do you really save!? Are you really scrimping every penny toward retirement? I bet not.
Losing a hundred dollars is doable for most people, and most people probably do it every month without realizing it. You aren't buying a lottery ticket, you are buying something you believe in. Like gold, food, or timber, [bitcoin is a commodity]( Owning a bitcoin is like [owning an ETF on all of bitcoin space]( Why in the world would you pass by this opportunity!?
Potential loss = $100
Potential gain = ~$56,780
Which one do you perceive to be the greater loss?

I do think that bitcoin might have it's place, maybe as a store of value or something of that nature. But bitcoin is unique in being one of the first items which is highly fungible, portable, and limited. It may be that we are totally unaware of how it will affect both the political and financial sphere of the globe. I have a feeling that if bitcoin truly takes off we will see a massive political shift.
Bitcoin may be the first step into a world where cryptocurrencies are the norm and people will have to decide what attributes they desire in their money. 
It could be that bitcoin will be the bedrock of a whole system of virtual money and wealth transfer. 
My personal hypothesis, holding that bitcoin will take hold as a world currency or store of value, is that bitcoin will skyrocket in value to the point where it will be overvalued and then have a massive crash. People will walk away realizing that a 'perfect gold' is not the answer. I don't think it will disappear, but it will stay around while other cryptocurrencies duke it out. It may end up being that there is a mix of crytpocurrencies which rise to the top and each one holds a set of political ideals as they trade at differing rates depending on the political climate of the globe.
All I know is that these topics are *WAY* above my paygrade and I would love to hear someone with the proper credentials with give a talk about them because I believe decentralized cryptocurrencies are the way of the future.

You don't have a newsletter to subscribe to :/ Always posting on reddit will result in diminishing returns. A bi-weekly newsletter would be awesome and I could donate every payday :D
I love the idea that we can spread awareness of bitcoin through donating to the community. It is a win, win situation for all parties involved. 
Free advertising about bitcoin for the bitcoiners, and free money for people in need! What could be better than that!? 
And the coolest part is that you are taking pictures and telling us about how much our donations mean to the people who need them. This is super important to do when most of us live so far away. 
Thank you so much for facilitating all of this!

You realize that the current exchanges cannot handle large flows of cash (think Wallst large) and they would break. An ETF traded on the NYSE allows for the large institutions to make those kinds of investments securely and swiftly right?
Mt. Gox is literally notorious at this point for not being able to withdraw funds. If you had a billion dollars and you wanted to invest a paltry 200mil into bitcoin do you think you would do it on Mt. Gox?
The ETF will be awesome, I can't wait.

I also buy my btc at Coinbase. I am willing to keep a small amount there, just like I keep a small amount on hand in my blockchain wallet on my phone.
But I keep most of my coins in a paper wallet. Here are my favorite paper wallet resources:
* [Great intro from Bitcoin Magazine](
* [A great website to generate paper wallets with](
* [My favorite way to generate raw transactions](
* [My favorite way to transmit raw transactions](
If you are paranoid that someone will steal your bitcoins from those websites, you can download them and generate all your transactions in an airgapped computer which you deem safe. Once you have a raw transaction you can take it with you to a computer connected to the net and transmit the raw transaction to the network. You don't have to do all of this song and dance, but your level of paranoid/safety is totally up to you.
I would suggest playing with a small amount of btc and getting comfortable with the wallet system. Paper wallets are only as secure and safe as you make them. And you should feel comfortable with them before using them.
Net based wallets are prone to hacking as we all know. Paper wallets put the security totally in your hands, which might not be a good thing if you make a mistake...
I would suggest spitting up your investment into multiple wallets, both net based and paper wallet based. I personally keep most of my funds in paper wallets because I like the security and the easy ability to back them up. Just print more than one copy of your wallet and boom! Backups everywhere! Hide them in your freezer, car, under the doghouse in the back yard, whatever.
Be warned that some printers are connected to the net and some inks are prone to fading!!! While it is unlikely that you will run into these issues, it is something to be aware of.
I love my paper wallets though! I only wish that I could find a more random way to generate them :/

I seriously doubt that my grandma could ever use bitcoin in any form except maybe a paper wallet I handed to her. She would probably just end up losing her coins.
I agree with all of your points though.

That is exactly the trouble isn't it? 
And most of us here in are hoping that we have the answer!
But a solution?... Yeah, the only thing I could say is that you buy a stretch of land, some guns, and some precious metals. Not much more you can do.
Maybe someday people like you and me can buy an asteroid, push it out to [L4 or L5 space]( and tell everyone else to bugger off. But before that happens your only hope is to be wildly rich or hope that bitcoins are truly the wave of the future.
Overall I put my trust in as many assets as I can get my hands on. I can only hope that no one steals them. But I sure as hell don't trust fiat or banks.

This is actually a good point. Not that I have anything against poor people, but have you ever seen one with a gold nugget? They would have trouble trading one of those too.
Rich people can 'afford' to be rich. I know it's not the same but I would think that btc makes it even easier to safely obtain a non-inflating store of wealth compared to an asset like gold.
If you trusted the counterparty you could even just call them up/snail mail them and ask them to keep/purchase coins for you, no internet required. Yeah it might be a pain but at least you can keep your hard work safe.

You also realize that a lot of tech people live in silicon valley right? CA is also home to **a lot** of real world bitcoin accepting businesses. People in WA and OR are in the same boat.
I am totally with you that we don't know the true representation but I think that the number of people who are using btc like myself are much higher. My father and mother (divorced so they are separate families) are also interested and they would never be hanging out on the silk road. I expect them to invest some of their funds sooner than later.
I think you are correct the numbers ***were*** tilted in the way you suggest but I think it's changing rapidly.
The fact you can buy stuff from Amazon and that you can buy gold/silver direct has changed the opinion of the people around me rapidly.

Forget that, just create a network which charges a small returnable fee (in bitcoin) to everyone who connects to the website (like a tor network but with bitcoins). Every request costs money, and all other requests are denied.
Boom, no more DDOS attacks, they cost too much.
I understand that this may be difficult to implement, but it seems feasible with bitcoin.

I don't understand your example, if you kept the first digit zero and cycled through all ten other digits and vice versa, you would have only tried all the combinations for zero in both positions. You would need to repeat the process for the other 9 digits. That would result 200 attempts if the combination was the last one.

But I if you are investing because the fundamentals intrigue you and you think that this technology is the wave of the future, then take your gamble like the rest of us and just wait it out for the next 5-10 years. Never invest what you can't afford to lose.

And for the government to shut down bitcoin they would have to locate every bitcoin miner in the world and turn off their computers. 
Sounds pretty hard to do even with the full might of the US government huh? They haven't been doing too good on that front with a lot of other p2p software either huh? XD
If they can't stomp out some music sharers and a few guys making money on the Silk Road, then how would they ever shut down one of [the world's largest distributed computing networks](
While bitcoin may not be at the point of worldwide acceptance yet, it is VERY promising. If you have not read the [Myths]( and [FAQ]( pages on the wiki, I highly recommend you do so :)
Even if you never buy a bitcoin, you will learn LOADS about Economics and cryptography when you educate yourself about bitcoins.

That was a terrible analysis, you can get much better info on [the bitcointalk speculation forums](
 
You also fail to include the MACD, RSI, CCI, and any kind of high frequency oscillation indicators. And what kind of daytrader would only use the SMA? What a terrible idea.
 
You are new to reddit (2 day old account) and you seem to be new to bitcoin, so let me help you out with a little secret about this point:
 


 
The volume tends to taper off on the weekends because bank transfers don't clear until Monday. While the price doesn't always fall, the volume almost always does. It has had this pattern for months, not that it can't change mind you.
But this is besides the point, the volume has not tapered off at all. It has increased in the past 20hrs or so. 
 
Why don't you take a look at [this chart]( I'm not a wallst trader, but I have learned to read basic charts and your analysis is going against what the market is currently demanding.
The OBV is up and the Parabolic SAR is showing bullish movement. And even though the RSI and CCI are overbought, the price is still moving up. The MACD isn't showing any strong signs of a nearing correction either.
And all of this means squat unless you know how to read a chart.
We have tested the $50-60 rage twice and the likelyhood that we will go that low again is low. Why is low? Because even my mom wants to buy them at that price!! 
 
TLDR: Have fun with your experiment, I will make my own decisions thanks.
But I do love [your chart](

Personally I like paperwallets. I use [brainwallet.org]( downloaded onto a thumbdrive from github to generate raw transactions and then copypasta the raw transaction and send it from any number of websites or pieces of software. At no point does my private key ever touch any network and all info is lost as soon as I reboot the computer.
I like to make pretty paper wallets with [bitaddress.org]( which is also downloadable via github.
The truly paranoid will want to use a rasberry pi which has it's OS on an SD card which can be removed and formatted.
So stupidly safe.
I guess you could generate the whole thing in a Faraday cage with a battery to make sure that no one could be listening in on your transaction via a power line if you really wanted...

I don't have any idea what I am talking about but doesn't that seem like it is none of the IRS's business? I understand that I need to claim taxes on things I bring back from my vacation but how would they claim the right to tax my transaction in another country?
That seems like it would be totally out of their jurisdiction and could be politically upsetting to other nations. I guess there is precedent about US citizens having to follow US laws while abroad but still.
Not that the US cares about upsetting other nations... \*cough\* **NSA** \*cough\*
**Edit 2**: I don't think [that gift tax]( applies to family members:












The annual exclusion applies to gifts to each donee. In other words, if you give each of your children $11,000 in 2002-2005, $12,000 in 2006-2008, $13,000 in 2009-2012 and $14,000 on or after January 1, 2013, the annual exclusion applies to each gift.


You are each entitled to the annual exclusion amount on the gift. Together, you can give $22,000 to each donee (2002-2005) or $24,000 (2006-2008), $26,000 (2009-2012) and $28,000 on or after January 1, 2013.
Which seems confusing because:


Making a gift or leaving your estate to your heirs does not ordinarily affect your federal income tax. You cannot deduct the value of gifts you make (other than gifts that are deductible charitable contributions). If you are not sure whether the gift tax or the estate tax applies to your situation, refer to [Publication 950, Introduction to Estate and Gift Taxes](
This sounds more complex than you are making out.

I was on my phone browsing while eating my lunch and I am glad I was alone because I actually did that out loud.
I read the comment and I was like, "Psh this guy is troll.... * scrolls up * * Jaw hits floor * * screams like a loon * NO WAAAY!?!?!"
Yeah something like that. It was a little shocking to see stuff happen like this. Even though I believe in bitcoin and that I hope that it is the future, I was totally blown away by what happened today.
I've been holding for a long time and I watched the craziness last night, and I was actually yelling at my screen, "Stop it you guys! That is too fast!! You are going to get taken for all you got!"
So when I saw the figure on the side at over 9k I just about jumped out of my shoes.

I don't think it is that hard to keep one piece of paper or set of keys secret. You can hide it anywhere. ANYWHERE!!
The only loophole is either the rubber hose method or that you tell the wrong person where you hid your keys.
But a thief taking my keys when he breaks into my house? Psh! Forget about it.
Hell, I have well over 300 books. I can just write the private key on one of the pages and he will have to dig through over 90k book pages before he even notices the key!
I could bury it in a random spot in the back yard, break it into pieces and share it with several trusted friends, encrypt it and hide it in plain sight, and even just stick it the back of a picture frame. 
Safety box? No effin way. No one is going to outsmart me. Not unless they are a super genius and they knew some amazing details about my life.

I don't understand, how is my coin stash keeping the price held up? I just don't give a fuck. I am waiting for $100k+ coins or literally $0
I have a feeling that bears are running out of coins faster than they can get "true believers"  to thaw out their cold wallets. If they are anything like me, they just want the cheapest coins they can grab and then just sit on them or play with a few in daytrader land. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:52:58

Don't talk to me about ripple. In no way is a company owned product, which has a debt trading aspect, something I endorse/agree with.

No. While you ***can***, it wouldn't be worth the electricity it costs to run them. If you still want to try, take [a look at the numbers]( Don't forget to multiply that difficulty figure by at least 10X and more likely 100X because of ASICs coming onto the market.
Edit: Mining is really a huge topic unto itself and if you are interested you need to do some serious research at a minimum. I hope this helps :)


[Coinbase]( They only [charge a 1% fee]( I use them all of the time, and they do direct bank transfers. Some people seem to have had trouble with them but their support seems solid and they do transfers in both directions. You might want to be careful being a money exchange though.

Having a house in the suburbs which generates no income or food is a manufactured idea. It is manufactured to make wage slaves. You are ***not*** middle class if you own one of these money pits and you don't have **at least** several million in money generating assets. You are getting paid by your masters to pay for your: car(s), house, medical bills, food, incidentals, taxes, children's education, and inflation. Oh,  and you get to keep the rest. Btw I hope you have enough stashed away to pay off [your debt]( Yes, you owe figure in the bottom, the one which says 'Liability per Taxpayer'. Will our money inflate out of control into another depression? I don't know, but I am not going to stand around and find out.
The people who were sold these purported investments were swindled. They were swindled right out of their happiness, health, and money generating skills. Now all they have is a building which is under a mountain of debt. It might as well be a pile of dirt, wood, and stone. Oh wait, it is. These poor souls are dependent on the infrastructure around them to continue functioning. They are not free, they ***think*** they are free. They think they are free because there are no chains on their feet or bars on their windows.
Astonishingly enough they are held with nothing more than a promise. This promise is shown to them on every TV, in every magazine ad, and in every supermarket. It is the American dream of a house in the suburbs and a college degree which has been sold to untold millions. Everyone knows how the housing bubble turned out for so many of these families.
Who is to blame? Don't ask me, I don't deal in conspiracies. I just deal in things which force people to think and evaluate what they know. These are simple things which could be taught to children in a single lesson. A single class could change the lives of 30 people. But not just 30 people, because every person they came into contact with could potentially share their knowledge. We cut funding to our schools every year and increase class sizes saying that it is cost effective.
The status quo will not change because we live in a sea of passivity, nothing matters because there are no problems knocking at *our* doors. Everything is an ocean away and there is no need to get upset because everything will be alright in the end. Be happy that you get to watch your movies and play your video games. Beer and cigarettes are just a stop on the way home. If you don't like your life just escape into something when you come home. Facing reality is tough.
I suggest to anyone who is reading this that they seriously consider if their current lives are making them happy. We are an isolated, depressed, and enslaved people. Don't believe me? You don't have to. Just think about what I am saying as you live your daily life. Try it, I implore you. Think about the the ranch I am going to buy and the life I wish to lead. Think about how you might like to fish, program, read, do your favorite hobby, or stand in the sun. Is a ranch really all that bad? Compare it with your current life. If you think it is something you might want to do, check out [Open Source Ecology]( They will free your soul, real freedom is so close. Don't let them take it from you.
I am sure a lot of you have heard this before but it bears repeating,


Are you happy? Truly? What would you be happiest doing? Hint: It's not a yacht, helicopter, hookers, and blow. Money does not bring happiness.
Every day we have a choice, what are you going to do with your day? If it is not the thing you wish to do, then why in the fuck are you doing it? *You are going to die*. If you have some shit you want to do you better hurry the fuck up.
The world is happening to you. Do you want your control back? You are going to have to fight for it, and it will be uncomfortable and difficult at the very least. Do you think all of your forefathers who fought for their freedom got to sit on their couches? You come from a long line of awesomely savage creatures and your lineage stretches back to the dawn of life on earth. Fucking act like it.

For saying what I was going to say.
Also, I would only buy things that you need. It's not like you can single handedly change the bitcoin economy by spending all your coin. Just treat your non investment savings portion like regular money. Encouraging the interest of others is much cheaper and more effective.

No offense, but I am not sure what I am supposed to think. There are just two guys going back and forth at a restaurant... upside down. Did I miss something? It seems like you just clipped some random cartoon show.
If you are referring to the bitcoin commercial I mentioned, I was looking for a real video with actors. I know my 1btc is not enough, I only mention it because I hope that someone might be interested and we could start a campaign of some kind. I do not have the means to make such a commercial, but I am sure I am not the only one who would be interested in such a commercial. And if the community liked what they saw they would probably donate more.
But this commercial would have to be of high quality. I don't give away my money like it grows on trees and neither does anyone else. A random tv clip is not going to go viral.

If you are going to buy, I would recommend sooner than later. I waited ~3months and it went from $6.5 to $10 When I finally bought. No guarantees for the future though, so only gamble what you can afford to lose.
I'm not selling anytime soon though, and possibly never! If bitcoins really take off I will just spend them as is. I bought a lot of my Christmas presents with btc and I loved it.

Please start with the [Common Myths]( located in the wiki. Combined with [the FAQ page]( you will have a lot of knowledge which has already been written.
If you have some more questions let me know, but please take the basic questions to the wiki. You are not the first person to have asked these exact same questions :)
And like said:


If you really want to learn, you have come to the right place. I have never regretted my long journey to understanding the world economy. Even if you never buy a coin, or you don't believe in the concept at all, you will not find a better resource to learn about the world economic picture than bitcoin.
If I never make a dime off of bitcoin, I will come out a richer man for having understood it entirely.

I agree with the others, if you are worried about your $500 then pull that amount out and leave the rest. 
If you don't mind possibly losing your $500 then just keep it. Come back in several years and make your decision then. This party is just getting started, up or down. The potential upside is absolutely outlandish, why not roll the bones and see what you get? 
Have you ever tried to calculate the possible value of a single bitcoin? Take 1% of the world gdp (remember that bitcoin is supposed to be a world currency) and divide that number by 21 million (the total number of bitcoins which will ever be in existence).
I'll wait. 
Did you scrape your jaw off the floor? Do you think it might be worth losing your money for that potential upside?

What does any of that have to do with the person who accepts bitcoins as payment? Your original point was that the person accepting bitcoins was exposed to risk, this is simply not true with bitpay. 
The money receiver sets a usd price and they get that amount in cash less the 1% fee bitpay charges. Still way less than the 4-6% fee that you get from using a credit card.
Yes bitcoins fluctuate, but who cares if you get what you want out of it? Let the bitcoin user worry about that. If you use bitcoins, you are aware of the price fluctuations.
It may not be ideal for rent, but it is perfect for a multitude of other methods of accepting payment. And you don't even have to worry about fraud.

I &lt;3 Coinbase. But I don't know how they would react to a large transaction when you don't have a history with them. I have never had any problems with their service though, I highly recommend trying them out. 
Edit: Btw, it looks like we will see some more downward movement in the very near future. You might be able to pick up some sub $100 coins if you are quick about it. Anything near $70 is a steal but I don't think it will go too far under $80. Be ready my friend ;) Taking bears lunch money is a beautiful thing.

You can also tax people for using public services. We do this at bridge tolls all of the time. 
You can tax people for using roads. Japan and Mexico do this very well.
You can tax people when you catch them speeding. Oh we already do that. 
You can tax people for maintaining public transportation. Oh we already do that.
You can tax people for using systems like the mail. Oh we already do that.
You can tax people for services like the FDA. Just tack it on to the cost of food production at the business level instead. I am sure that no one will want to buy food not tested by someone looking out for their safety.

I just keep buying coins because bitcoins make my money stronger than an ox. Yes the value might fall in the short term, but I am here to stay. Unless there is a catastrophic failure I foresee myself purchasing/using bitcoins far into the future.
The people who were 'uncertain' and jumped ship with the fork were just the uneducated. They jumped ship because they did not understand the inner workings of bitcoin. The smart money got out soon and bought in at the bottom of the dip for a sweet 23% profit(If I recall correctly). They had faith in bitcoin and they just wanted a greater number of coins, I wish I had the ability to daytrade like that!
Coins are going up in price because the market is demanding them, simple as that.
Of course there are issues around the world which will drive the price, but those are innumerable. The one thing which is driving the value of bitcoin is the number of people who are using it. The more people who use it, the more value it is assigned. They are $50 a coin for a reason, people value them.
Some of us just value them more than others :)

Now out of curiosity, wouldn't having that many bitcoins make you a gigantic target? I know bitcoin is secure, but I would think that as the value of bitcoins grows the potential amount of coins which you could possibly 'cash out' without someone noticing would become harder and harder. If you have several billion in coins for example, you would  have an impossible time cashing out.
Thousands of dollars and possibly millions in cash would be fairly easy(compared to billions). But moving much more than those amounts is a dangerous business.

Why do you care what people are doing with their money and what does it matter to bitcoin as a whole?
I get that **YOU** don't like the counterparty risk of an ETF but the rest of the world, especially gigantic banks, really like ETFs.
Think about gold, think about how most people who trade gold only trade contracts and really don't WANT to take possession of the gold they are trading. Do you really think some guy who buys 500mil in gold wants it delivered to his apartment in NYC?
Yes, the ETF will take control of your bitcoins for you. Who cares?

This was his comment about Pascal's wager. But I don't agree that it signals the end of a bubble, quite the opposite. People have been making this bet in various forms since the conception of bitcoin.
[Pascal's wager]( was originally a philosophy which stated that everyone should accept God because of the infinite possible gain.
Excerpt from Wikipedia:




* A Game is being played... where heads or tails will turn up.
* According to reason, you can defend neither of the propositions.
* You must wager. (It's not optional.)
* Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing.
* Wager, then, without hesitation that He is. (...) There is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. And so our proposition is of infinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.
A defense against this philosiphical argument was:


However, this is semantics. Not only was Pascal's wager about God, but even if you apply it to bitcoin what difference does it make?
I wasn't forcing people to make a choice, I was asking them if they agreed with my hypothesis. Don't agree? Don't buy.
I was only pointing out reasoning which might help others make a choice. seems to disagree that bitcoin might be worth money in the future, I will think my way and he will think his. I simply wanted to add to the conversation :)

In the months since December when I bought my coins at 11 dollars bitcoin has doubled at least 11 times. What RATIONAL reason do you have, besides:


And why would this ruin his life? I'm not sure, but looks like he has invested a normal amount into bitcoin.
If he is a rational person, why should he care if he loses expendable money? Is that not the point of expendable money? To be spent, lost, or otherwise burned up?
You don't know the future just like the rest of us.
I know I don't care about the money I invested. If I lose it, big deal.
In the meantime I will be hanging on for this ride. For better or worse.

I think that the 'bubble' is only just beginning. The search volume is low because the next wave is just starting. The volume and volatility aren't anywhere near the levels of the $32 spike, and this will be reflected in a massive rise past $150. How far? Beats me. Where will it 'pop'? Your guess is as good as mine. But make no mistake, we won't be coming back to $40 levels unless something terrible happens.

I also think people will be reluctant to change to another cryptocurrency because they know they would have to bet on others moving their money into it as well. And if there are a number of cryptocurrencies available, then why litecoin or namecoin? Why not cryptocurrency X, Y, or Z?
The chicken and egg philosophy is a tough nut to crack. And with every rise in price of bitcoin, the potential of a change happening lessens.
We aren't talking about moving from Myspace to Facebook, we are talking about risking your fortune on a possible dud when there is an already proven thoroughbred racehorse. At most you could put some play money into one of these countless variations which seem to have no real advantage over the main branch.

While I generally agree, [the market does not](
Not that any single datapoint is relevant, but that blue line below the all time chart? That is the On Balance Volume. What is the OBV you ask?
Here is [a charting school explanation](


TLDR: The market is saying that we will continue this trend for a least a while longer. $500? $1k? Heck if I know, but the market will tell us soon enough. The momentum is tremendous, and your hypothesis that the market will stop its growth is like predicting that a freight train will stop on a dime because it is moving too fast.
Bubble or growth? It isn't that simple. Don't listen to all of these people who don't own any coin or are buying them because they see the price going up. Despite the naysayers, there are fundamental reasons that bitcoin is growing. The real question is, where will it stop?

I have no idea if this is possible, but it would be cool if you could buy coupons/gift cards with btc. But here is the idea: they are all redeemable via smartphone.
You don't have to swipe a card or print out a coupon, you just show the cashier your phone. 
Barcodes, discount numbers, idc. Just make it effortless to never touch a dollar again. We are already a cashless society, so this would be an easy transition. All your btc needs directly ported to reality, all in one place.

True, but I feel like bitcoin is too speculative for the Asian (China also has a similar problem) families who possess the "save forever and possess no debt" mentality. I would expect them to buy gold before they buy bitcoin.
But maybe the younger generation might buy in, because they see the flexibility of keeping their savings in bitcoin.
Although, even though I keep a number of bitcoins, I would never put my entire savings into bitcoins. It is too risky at the moment. Why should anyone in Japan, or anywhere for that matter, run and put all their money into bitcoin (As of today, not the future)?

I just bought 5 coins before this rather scary price jump. I made a decent amount on just that single purchase. Overall, I am up for the year and I plan to buy even more despite the fact that the price *may* crash in the short term future. If you have money to burn and you like the concept of bitcoins, jump in! It is scary at first, but as long as you are only investing play money, then who cares if you lose it? The potential upside is absolutely astounding over the long term. Just don't expect to ever see a dime and you will be pleasantly surprised when you make any money at all. 
Yes it's speculation but don't we make dumber purchases on a regular basis? Skip some beers, buy a few less Starbucks. You don't even need to buy whole bitcoins to be part of the future. Just get your feet wet and see how you feel about this idea called bitcoin :)

I am not understanding, is personal and social responsibility a bad thing?


Ok now I am being called an anarchist. I don't know where you got that from. I just said that I wanted to be socially responsible by taking care of myself.


Yes I do know, and I am not upset with them. I am upset with the government, large companies, and banks. Their happiness and hard work is being taken from them. No one is bad they just don't have enough hours in the day to break down the doors of their senators for every little thing. They are being nibbled to death. Why should they  **NOT** drink a cold beer at the end of the day and get a break?
Yes it frustrates me that I can't get more people active in politics, but whatever. If that is fate then so be it. I'm not gonna go 'Tyler' on anyone.


Woh, hold the presses. I wasn't trying to make anyone mad, take a look at my own words:


I am sorry if that made you angry, I was not trying to force anything on anyone. That goes against my personal beliefs, you are correct I am a right leaning libertarianish kinda guy. I don't like conflict if I can avoid it.






I didn't mean for that to sound like I was forcing my ideas down anyone's throat. I do have strong leanings about how people should take care of themselves, but like I already said, forcing things upon other people goes against my personal ethics. I don't want it done to me and I don't want it done to you.
The only thing I want to force on anyone are some laws to keep them from hurting me or you. I want people to be able to make their own decisions about their lives. I am happy with the diversity of society, I want things to continue thrive. It would be a tragedy if all of these doom and gloom predictions which have been hitting the headlines are correct.
This is why I have strong leanings about personal responsibility, I *want* &lt;--- people to be able to fight for themselves against these problems. I don't like they seem toothless in front of these monster companies and governments. I may not be able to force them, but I can *ask*&lt;-- them:


And I am definitely not saying that everyone should be a survivalist. GET OFF MY LAWN! Just kidding. 
All I was trying to ask is for people to examine the position they are in. They are in a far better position to decide how to secure their own lives than I am. I don't want to lead anyone! I just want to spread awareness. There are warnings happening everywhere and both sides of the isle are nervous.
Do I know what is going to happen?


Should you take action? That is for you to decide, I don't want to force anyone.
I am terribly sorry if I offended you, that was not my intention. In fact I would appreciate it if you pointed out what was wrong with my comments. It seems that a lot of people have misunderstood me greatly, and I would like to be able to communicate to more people in a nonthreatening manner.
I am not really good with words and I tend to miscommunicate a lot. I just want to be able to talk to the widest audience possible without making them upset. I know that some people will disagree with me but that is the nature of the beast.

You take the private key and the public key of your desired transaction and [generate the transaction with something like this]( You then you broadcast the transaction to the network. And in the case of that webpage you hit 'send transaction'.
A wallet is just a pair of keys, one public and one private. The private one is the vulnerable part and it is what can be stolen from your computer by electronic means. 
So if you make it on a secure airgapped computer and print it out or write it down, no one can steal it electronically. And since wallets are small you can hide them practically anywhere and make duplicates of them. 
Backups of your money! Beat that dollar! :D
While it is annoying to a degree, the security is bar none if you do it right.
Personally I don't use a majority of my btc. I keep a small portion in my blockchain wallet which I am willing to lose and I keep my savings in my paper wallet. It helps to keep me from spending it as I have to jump through some hoops to get it out.
Make sure you put it in a safe place though! And some printer inks fade over time!! D: So make sure you are writing it down in a safe manner. Keep it safe from fires! What might happen to your savings if your house burnt down!?
And to put funds into the wallet you don't even have to use the private key. You can keep the public key on your person or in plaintext on your computer desktop(providing you aren't using it for something you shouldn't). Just send funds to it like any other wallet :)
If I missed anything just let me know.

I know that I considered it as an attack vector, but I just didn't care. My printer is pretty old and I bet you would have to do some serious work to try and mess with the OS. There was another thread where someone pointed out a specific printer which was a known vulnerability but I don't remember where...
Maybe we will have to outline 'safe' printers? I bet the simpler ones are safer.

Don't worry about being identified at first, think of it like getting cash from an ATM or bank. When you walk in you are identified, but you walk out with cash. The only difference is that you need to use a [mixing service you trust]( [ [1] ]( [[2]]( (just a suggestion, please do your own research) because everyone knows the exact transaction you made when you 'withdrew' money.
I love Coinbase I highly recommend them as a way to get your coins.

By being the first in the industry to accept bitcoins it means that you will be the first business a bitcoin user turns to when they want to purchase a product from your industry. This is a huge advantage, don't waste the opportunity.
If you know your market demographic well, try and figure out where to advertise within the bitcoin sphere of influence and where you think you will find most of your customers. Especially pay attention to where your ad clickthroughs come from and focus on those websites. Direct marketing via deals with website owners and operators is always the best way to kick ass and take names with PPC advertising. Take a look at [this Butterfly Labs ad]( on this mining calculator website. They know exactly where their customers are and they want their business.
See if you can gain customers via discounts which are only available through bitcoin (use that industry standard 1% transaction fee to your advantage). You want people to say to themselves, "I could buy it in usd here, but if I buy it **here** in btc I save X or get X kind of extra service or value! And I even get to support my favorite cryptocurrency! These guys rock!" People are more likely to compare your product and remember your business if they have a reason to bookmark you or remember your name. Don't get lost in the sea of Google search results. Amazon and the like will beat you every time. Adding bitcoin to your search terms won't change this.
Depending on how fast bitcoin adoption spreads and the likelihood at which your competitors may also start to accept bitcoin, you may only have a short window in which to gain an advantage. 
Use the fact that bitcoin is a niche market to your advantage. Work hard on obtaining a reputation within the community and you will go far. Just like any marketing, the outcome is based on how much money you spend and how much effort you put into it.
Online marketing is a tough gig but you have a major advantage in the btc market. You are first.
Edit: And I am sure you know about [bitpay]( and how your brother doesn't even have to keep btc to accept them right? Instant cash out or keep a custom btc/usd split of your choosing. Beat that Paypal! Bitcoin is more wicked cool than it has ever been.
@_date: 2013-02-04 23:16:47
Maybe we could just let Coinbase hold X amount of fiat dollars as a deposit, in advance, and then we can get our money immediately. That way if the ACH transfer fails Coinbase holds no risk and can just take the deposit.

No, this is part of [the tipbot system]( There is a bot on reddit which holds a bitcoin wallet for you. [This is a pretty good intro]( into what wallets are and how to use them.
You can use an online wallet like [bockchain.info]( [a software based wallet like Electrum]( or [a paper wallet which you print out]( (This one is recommended for large amounts which are vulnerable to malware.)
You can make backups of any of these, and no that does not mean you are making more bitcoins, it only means you are copying the wallet address.


Short answer: No.
Long answer: While online wallets are vulnerable to hacking and password theft, you do have the ability to back them up. This means that you can retrieve your coins from a software on your computer like Electrum.
Keep in mind that your wallet is not located on any one website, but the public key is located on all of the computers running the bitcoin mining software(not technically true, but an easy way to think of it). The computers running the mining software do not know your private key, but they keep a ledger of how many bitcoins you hold and attach it to your public key. This is why they get a reward for maintaining this service.
Your bitcoins are safe as long as these things hold true:
* 1 No one takes your private key from you. Whether online or in your head, this is the key which allows you to move them from place to place.
* 2 The bitcoin network does not shut down. Considering that bitcoin is [one of the largest computing networks in the world]( this is unlikely.
* 3 The two forms of encryption which make bitcoin are simultaneously broken. This would be bad, but you would have a lot bigger things to worry about. Governments would fall, stock markets would crash,  and general mayhem would ensue. And unlike all of those entities, [bitcoin has a plan](


You do not have to add a fee to your bitcoin transfers, however it is recommended to add a fee because it incentivizes miners to add your transaction into their block. A default fee of .0005btc is the current standard (about $.05) but you can make it smaller. The normal amount is about a penny or ~.000108btc
All transactions done by the tipbot are held within the tipbot's system until you transfer your bitcoins to another wallet of your choosing. The tipbot makes a wallet for you whenever you sign up. And you can add or make a new wallet anytime.
All transfers done with the tipbot use standard fees if I remember correctly, but I would have to look at the documentation more closely.
Really though, this is all just the tip of the iceberg. There is a metric ton of info to ingest and we have not even covered all the basics :P
BTW, Hold on to that dollar. I gave a dollar in btc to a young lady last Christmas and it is now worth ~$6.89. And it may sound outlandish to someone who is unfamiliar with bitcoin, but it would not be outrageous to say that her dollar may be worth $20+ by the end of this year.
And to put it another way, if you live near me, I will give you $.25 in cold hard cash for that dollar back :D Seriously.
I bet other forum members would do the same in a heartbeat. They would try and outbid me too. Everyone would want your bitcoin under the market value. They don't want the usd, they want the btc.
How odd, I wonder why? trollface.jpg

We need a billion bitcoin users to push it over the mass adoption bridge!? 
7billion * 15% = 1.05 billion
:/ I don't think that is accurate.
Lets try just the USA
315million * 15% = 47.25 million
Cool! much better! lets try some more!
In no particular order:
* UK 63 million * 15% = 9.45 million
* Russia  143 million * 15% = 21.45 million
* Japan 127 million * 15% = 19.05 million
* Mexico 115 million * 15% = 17.25 million
* Canada 33.4 million * 15% = 5.01 million
* China 1,353.8 million * 15% = 203.07 million
* India 1,210 million * 15% = 181.5 million
* Norway 5 million * 15% = .75 million
(All data from Wikipedia)
And what of online communities? Can we not count them as some kind of mass adoption? Personally I think of them as mini nations.
[Unlabeled data from here](
* reddit 43 million * 15% = 6.45 million
* Facebook 1,060 million * 15% = 159 million
* [Github]( 3 million * 15% = .45 million
* [4chan]( 18 million * 15% = 2.25 million
* [2chan]( 11 million * 15% = 1.65 million
* Yahoo mail 281 million * 15% = 42.15 million
* Gmail 425 million * 15% = 63.75 million
* Twitter 500 million * 15% = 75 million
I also don't think that in either case we need to convince all of those people. Any one of those smaller communities would probably be more than sufficient to trigger mass adoption. Think about Internet adoption, it wasn't worldwide when it started. We probably only need to convince 15% of 'first world': geeks, anarchists, libertarians, and drug users that this is something they need. 
If we peg our desired adoption figure at something like 10-50 million users, we are already off to a pretty good start. I have seen numbers like 500k-2mil tossed around. These numbers don't seem all that bad when you consider some of these smaller countries/communities. Mass adoption may be a lot closer then we think.
Dang, that took forever to make! I need to take a break!

[This one]( should actually be linked with an explaination on that myths page. it took me a while to find and when I originally found it it took hours of searching to get to and understand. I was also concerned about quantum computers when I first entered bitcoin, but now I realize that if bitcoin's encryption is broken that we, the world, will have bigger problems. If SHA-256 and other encryptions are broken then the stock market, banks, governments, and more will all be scrambling to fix all of the pieces. It would be akin to someone learning how to counterfeit gold perfectly. Bad things would happen.










    The alert system may be compromised. 




    OP_CHECKSIG will be changed to use some other hash outside of old blocks.




    All hashing Bitcoin does will use the new hashing algorithm. 


Anything which breaks SHA-256, including quantum computers, would be considered a 0-day threat. Read more about bitcoin contingency plans on [this page]( if you are interested.
Edit: Personally, after reading the Contingency plans page I felt MORE secure keeping bitcoins than I do keeping dollars. What is the usd backup plan? Print more?

... Both? I keep some just like I keep some of my savings in my bank account. I spend some, just like my bank account.


For me it was the opposite. Once I started moving my money I felt very comfortable and I keep a portion of my coins for liquid use. I just replenish the coins I use, and even though it takes some time, I always have enough on hand when making purchases &gt;=$60usd(I like having to think about making bigger purchases anyway). I think of it like my actual wallet where I go to the store or an ATM to withdraw cash. I have a phone(Android w/ net-wallet) and a real wallet, each has its purpose.

I have personally done hundreds of dollars worth of business with Coinbase. I started small like you so I never got one of the cancellations which so many seem to complain about. They probably tried to make huge purchases without being authenticated. I have made some pretty big purchases and I will keep using them.

You do not need to use tor unless you need anonymity. And is right, [localbitcoins]( is probably the easiest way to get bitcoins unless you know someone in the US who is willing to let you use their bank account and you can send them money.
You could also [sell something on bitmit]( and get coins that way. &lt;--Pretty easy to sell stuff.
[bitcoin-otc.com]( is also another way you might be able to work out some kind of trade for bitcoins. Check out the irc channel  and see if you might be able to get someone to help. Be careful not to get scammed though, use the web of trust system outlined on the bitcoin-otc website.

I might add that you should try to 'write off' the amount you purchase as lost or spent.

It also helps you make better decisions about whether you should sell or hold :)

Those people didn't make money. They traded in reality and ideas. They traded their very lives and they were sick to death of parasites feeding off their essence. Their essence was the sweat on their backs and brows.

What does that have to do with reducing the overall cost per bitcoin if you are interested in investing?
I am assuming that the OP is interested in owing btc because he owns btc. It seemed like a safe assumption.
My second assumption is that he is interested in having cheaper bitcoins. Hence the idea [buying into the dips]( This has nothing to do with gambling...
All of this is based on the assumption that the OP believes that bitcoin will rise in value. He held his coins, he bought them in the first place, he is interested in making a return on these assumptions.
I have no idea wtf you are on about. This advice had nothing to do with gambling and everything to do with investing.
I also hold bitcoin and I have made gains. Does this mean I am a gambler? 


You are out of your mind. The market does not work like that. EVERY transaction has an influence on the overall market. We are all part of it whenever we buy ANYTHING. Basic economics.


Uh... that is like saying that you shouldn't consider the past performance of Google when you buy Google stock. Or that you shouldn't think about the context of the US economic history when investing in US stocks.
What in the world are you talking about?
The gamblers fallacy has to do with odds when gambling. When a gambler thinks he will win with the mockingbird method or that he 'has to win' this slot pull because he lost so many times before. It has nothing to do with a stock, security, asset, or everyday purchase.
Please do not tell me that investing is gambling. Just no.

I don't understand your wording, but I use Coinbase all the time and I have never ticked that box and I never will. 
Boxed ticked = bitcoin priced on the day your money clears the ACH transfer. This means that you are subject to the volatility of bitcoin in the 7 day interum. 
Box not ticked = bitcoin priced at the time of purchase. This is the one I use. 
And no, I had no problems with the changes. But I have been using Coinbase for 6 months. I would never use Gox, Coinbase is just too easy.

Yes, but then you don't stand to make a large gain either. Most of the people using bitcoin are here because of the 'someday'. If you want a stable investment buy some gold, T-bills, property, or bonds.
Disclaimer: I do not trust the US Gov to keep their promises on T-bills and bonds within the next 5-10 years. Do your own due diligence on this topic!! Paper markets are not happy right now!!
Yes bitcoin is volatile, but this is a chicken before the egg question. With every new set of 'strong hands' comes a stronger floor. The money will eventually flow into the hands which will keep them without selling them(too much). And the price will inevitably rise. When? Heck if I know, and don't bet on it! 
The real question is, "How much can you stand to lose?"
If you have read a lot about bitcoin and you believe in the fundamentals: scarcity, fungibility, next to impossible to counterfeit, portability, decentralized, and so many more. Then just buy some, even one will be just fine, and then stop worrying! Your investment should not cause you duress.
If you are worrying about losing the money you then have invested yourself in over your limit. [Don't be like this guy and lose $10k in a panic sell](
This is why so many people talk about 'weak hands' and 'strong hands'. Believing in bitcoin means that you are in for the ride, good or bad. Unless you are an experienced daytrader you are unlikely to make any money off of the price swings. DON'T DO IT!!
The longterm holders of bitcoin rip on the panic sellers because they are doing just that, panicking! We ask them, why are you gambling!?
Look, you have to have faith when you buy a house right? You have to have faith that your property won't [suddenly be worth nothing]( There are no 'sure thing' investments, only *differing degrees of risk*.
You sound like you are on the fence, if you have money you consider disposable, don't be! Just consider it gone when you buy your coins and enjoy the wild ride in the meantime. I did, and I am having a blast!
Up or down, [this is the most fun I have ever had with my money](
Edit: I also agree with your original point, we are going to need some stability before people take bitcoin seriously.

I just bought some, not that I am a daytrader. I am a buy and hold for the long term kinda guy. But they look positive over on the bitcointalk forums and here on reddit.
But if we make a break toward the $30 mark you won't be able to buy btc at a stable price less than $25 for a while at least, and maybe never again. You can already envision the headlines right? "BITCOIN BACK FROM THE DEAD AS IT HEADS TOWARD THE $32 DOLLAR HIGH AGAIN!"
People will trying to get in on the spike far too late. **IF** we go towards $30 that is.
But don't quote me, this is just my opinion. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Have you ever done the math on how much they might be worth if they are adopted worldwide? Go over to Wikipedia and look at the yearly gdp for the world. Divide that number by 21 million, and you will get a general idea of what the possible upside is. 
Remember that a currency is only as valuable as people perceive it to be, and that people perceive scarce things as valuable. The more people who use bitcoin the more valuable it becomes. 
But who knows, they could also be worth a big fat zero! Only ever invest what you can stand to lose.

Sorry my friend, I think you are SOL. Any real bitcoin exchange company worth their salt will help you out if you get to the front page of This is the second largest bitcoin forum on the net and tech companies know that they are made and broken through word of mouth. This is ESPECIALLY true for anonymous companies within the bitcoin economic sphere where trust is the lifeblood of your business.
Unless they show up, you got taken. What possessed you to trust this unknown company with such a sum if you don't mind my asking?

That is known as inflation. And yes, most Keynesian economists would agree that inflation is good. However, Austrian economists do not agree with this stance. They feel that inflationary currencies are bad for the economy in the long run. 
Whether you believe either party it does not matter, bitcoin is a deflationary currency by design and it seems it will stay that way.
Personally I would like to see an inflationary cryptocurrency in conjunction with bitcoin but I haven't seen a good one yet. 
Gold and fiat can exist just like bitcoin and altcoin-xyz would be able to. At least this is my personal belief.

You misunderstand, survival is my **highest** priority. The costs involved in supporting the American dream are being printed right out from under 60% of US citizens. I am not saying that it is bad to want these things, because I too want all of these things. It is just that the security which you speak of no longer exists. The US has sabotaged it's own ideal.
I see the US subrub as a place to be 'happy' and not 'survive' as you are putting it. The people in these houses do not have **the ability** to take care of their own lives if something goes wrong. This includes the debt crisis, a disaster, a water shortage, and the list goes on. They count on the government for their survival. They sit in their living room and watch TV to keep from having to face the reality that they are closer to the edge than they would like to believe. ***They*** are the ones who are putting happiness before survival. It is hard work to take your fate into your own hands, they would rather let someone else do it even though they have the freedom to choose security over happiness. They would rather have a cable package, a ps3, and a shiny car. 
Financial independence from society *IS* survival. It is only when you take matters into your own hands do you control your own fate.
I am not sure about you, but I will choose to take my survival into my own hands. I don't trust anyone with my life but myself and a few close friends. I don't trust a government who cannot provide water to people in disaster zones or that prints my money right out of my pocket. Do you want those people taking care of your survival? I refuse.
Also I keep seeing people say that I am talking about endless hobbies. I was unaware that starting a business was considered a hobby. A real ranch is a business. If it does not make money, *then* your ranch is a hobby.
My business will support my whole life and I will be unafraid of all of the debt woes or daily worries which most Americans face.
Also, I take my main hobbies: welding, programming, fabrication, disaster preparedness, wealth building, languages, and more. To be extremely useful to my survival. Hell, even fishing is helpful! What do you more do you want me to do?
I won't be fulfilled until I control my own fate. And yes, achieving all of these things will make me fulfilled, do you have a problem with that? That is ***my*** American dream.

You are mistaking a career for a productive life. Colleges and companies do not bring you achievements, you bring the achievements to them with the strength of your mind and your body. You don't need them, they need you. You are creative and productive without the guidance of society. 
Do you think the characters in Atlas Shrugged needed someone to validate or shape their work? To pay them so they could achieve greatness and happiness? Hell no. 
They traded their work and kept as much for them selves as possible. 
You are a fool if you think society is trading with you as fairly as the citizens of Gault's Gulch did with one another. They are stealing your life away. College degrees, shitty suburb houses, and even the job you work at.

You know it went from pennies to about $2 at one point right? And from ~$5 to ~$15 within the span of several months.... This last leg isn't all that crazy compared to some of the other price jumps/drops.
What do *you* think? I think you like the idea and you might like owning a few btc. Why don't you give it a try, don't even bother buying a whole one. Just buy something with a small amount or maybe just keep it for a month. Sleep on it.

If you sign up for [coinbase.com]( you can buy a few dollars worth of btc and see how you like the process. I find their system to be easier to use than Paypal. The only drawback is that you have to wait for a week for the bank transfer to complete. Your price is locked in though so you won't be charged more if btc goes up in value while you are waiting.
You don't have to buy in big to see how you feel about the whole thing. I would suggest getting $5-$20 worth and either buying something small from one of the many [bitcoin accepting businesses]( ([pizza maybe!?]( Personally I ***LOVE*** [the caramels from Bees Brothers]( Or trying out the tipbot which you have been getting tips from (I use the tipbot almost every day!).

Think about that for a second. Imagine you have money sitting on a few exchanges and you see an arbitrage opportunity. You buy low priced bitcoins on one exchange and you sell them on another. Now you have cash sitting on the high priced exchange but there is still an arbitrage opportunity. How do you get the cash to the low priced exchange to continue to close the gap and make money? Bank transfers really show their age when you examine this process.

You are supposed to pay taxes on the gains you made from exchanging bitcoins for fiat. It is the capital gains tax, the same law as if you made a gain trading in the Forex or commodities markets. Capital gains is 30% of the exchange if you held for less than a year and 15% if hold for a year or more. 
It is the same law as if you had bought physical gold with cash in a precious metals shop. Technically the shop won't report transactions under 10k usd but you are still supposed to pay the capital gains tax. Not paying those taxes is tax evasion. 
I am not an accountant, do not take my word for it. Please consult a professional. I am only parroting what my tax advisor told me.

So you think you know bitcoin eh?
Let's go through some articles I sent *my* dad:
[How Owning Bitcoin Is Owning An ETF On The Whole Bitcoin Space](
[The World’s First Cryptographic Commodity]( (cashed page, I don't know why they deleted the article :/)
And you know that bitcoin is supposed to be a world/internet currency right? And that there will only **ever** be 21million of them?
What would happen if we took over 1/10% of the world gdp? [How much would those coins be worth?](
[The target value for bitcoin](
And that is just the tip of the iceberg. I have been reading about bitcoin for more than 6 months and I learn new stuff ***every day***. How much have you been reading?
Could you lose money betting on a strange Internet commodity/currency? You bet. But you can also lose money buying an expensive new pair of sneakers, a Gameboy, or something else frivolous.
Is it worth it to jump on the bandwagon? That is up to you to decide. Don't ask people what to spend your money on, a fool and his money are soon parted. Do you have too much money and you don't know what to spend it on? Give it here! 
Keep in mind that the risk of buying bitcoins is factored into the current price. Why aren't they $10k a coin yet? Because the world might not like them or something may go wrong. If you ask for your guardians to help you buy coins, you need to stress to them that you are willing to lose the money you are investing. Don't tell them that you plan to make millions, just let them know you think bitcoins are cool. Just like any other kid buying any other frivolous item.
Just let them know how much they are worth in 6 months or a year. You just might make their eyes pop out of their head. Your intuition just might have been right on the money :)

I have been wondering this myself, I feel like it might be profitable to go places and sell bitcoins. The 10k money moving limit wouldn't bother me, and I would get to travel. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal.
The only catch for me would be that you would have to make at least enough to cover travel expenses.

I would learn how to use a paper wallet. They are much more secure if you are keeping them for a long hold.
You can download the  website and use it in an offline computer if you are super paranoid. And for the truly schizophrenic you can load it on a livecd and only ever generate transactions in a brand new install environment.
Paper wallets are easy to use, and you can even [import them into your blockchain wallet with ease]( You could even make a new blockchain wallet every time to be super paranoid! That way your funds would only be vulnerable for a *very* short period of time.
Check out Armory and Electrum as well. There are so many ways to keep your money safe it's not even funny. 
You are more likely to lose your funds because you made a mistake than you are to lose your bitcoins if you are careful.
Also check out I hope that helps!

What happens if I go on vacation and exchange my bitcoins for local currency? Like a localbitcoins transaction or something. 
~~I get that I am currently not taxed when I buy goods direct but that doesn't seem like it will last.~~ **Edit**: Seems that this is wrong. 
What about if I sell things for bitcoin or if I pay employees in bitcoin? Do special rules apply? Do my employees have to pay a capital gains tax if they make gains on their paycheck? Can they claim losses? 
If I give gifts of bitcoin to family members do they have to pay taxes on any gains? What happens if I make a barter with them for bitcoins?

Why? They work great and they keep the blockchain a manageable size. When you add more encryption you increase the size of the data you need to manage. Lighter is better when possible. What you are asking for is to increase the 'weight' of the blockchain for no real reason.
Also, [a 0-day exploit]( means that there is no warning about the security hole so the devs can patch the hole. With quantum computing you would have plenty of warning because you would have headlines telling you it was on the way. A 0-day exploit would mean that someone had made a breakthrough in mathematics which allowed them to guess the underlying values of the code which encrypts bitcoin. Much more dangerous than a quantum computer. And if you are afraid of a 0-day exploit in SHA-256, then why not in SHA-512 or any other code for that reason? You have to have limits on reason.

I always replace my stock of btc when I buy things with btc. I just buy the desired amount btc and then make my purchase. 
I would spend my btc but I would rather spend my worthless fiat dollars. I just want people in the btc world to know that they have a customer who wants to pay with coins.
I will spend my btc savings direct when I either get paid in btc or the value increases to the point where I don't mind the loss.

I disagree that the US should be the main target, I think that we should focus on the total number of worldwide adopters. And we should especially focus on smaller countries and groups. 
Reddit may use bitcoin, but we definitely don't have anywhere near 6.45 million people using it yet. Were you able to watch the above video? I feel like I might have miscommunicated my point. 
No, I do not think that 15% of geeks are using bitcoin. I have a **lot** of friends and most of them are geeks and about half of them are redditors. Only 2 out of... * counts friends *... * loses count *... about 70 use bitcoin, and about ten of those know of the idea that the Internet has a weird currency. 
We are still quite a ways off from convincing this group that they need bitcoins. 
As for the link, I am not sure what the idea was. It seemed like an ideal and not a concrete concept...

I got Google Goggles to scan it. But my Blockchain and Mycelium wallet didn't like it. :/ Seems to be hit and miss.
I am using a Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket II if that makes any difference to anyone.
**Edit:** Mycelium scanned great when I turned **off** continuous autofocus.
**Edit2:** I also got my Barcode Scanner app to scan it ok, I also had to turn **off** the autofocus. I also got my RedLaser app to scan it but no autofocus fix there. Blockchain sill hates it. I have lots of QR code apps because this happens to me all the time.

You must have never worked on a ranch before. You earn your relaxation time with blood, sweat, and tears. I need to feed my family, fix my fences, produce enough extra to pay my taxes and incidentals. I would rather do any of these things than have to sit in my hole of an office where I never see the light of day. 
I can learn to play an instrument, speak Spanish, complete one of my countless projects, or read one of the endless number of books which I miss doing so much. 
As for fishing, I would love to become an expert fisherman. It would be a great achievement and I would feel endlessly proud to be able to lie about the one that got away.

Doesn't that give an excessive amount of power to the people who can afford the most miners? Especially if ~100 years in the future no one wants to run rigs anymore because it's not profitable, can't the guy with the most rigs just make changes to the code arbitrarily? I am still not understanding how this *isn't* a problem.

No, Satoshi did not create a backdoor into the bitcoin code. Do you really think that people would have $500million USD of their money in a currency with a possible hole in it?
Go read the wiki. Common Myths and FAQs----&gt;
Anyway, bitcoins are made when people run the bitcoin software on their mining rig. You can run it on your computer but you won't make very much money. The hashing power required is a lot more than your computer can output. The difficulty to mine them increases as there are more computers added to the network. So the first coins were easy to mine with any computer and now it requires specialized hardware.
You sound like you have a lot of questions and you have a lot of reading to do before you understand how bitcoins work. I have been reading for months and I am just beginning to get a handle on all of this craziness.
Happy learning :) Oh and:
