The United States isn’t Zimbabwe, we don’t just print more money.

You can actually see what the government is spending your tax money on. Take a look at the spending budget before making an absurd assertion like that.

How do you think we should fund the expansion of our infrastructure if not through taxes?

And if you did purchase war bonds, you would have been kicking yourself for not buying more. If the government isn’t able to pay them back, then you are way more fucked than you think.

No, no matter how hard he believes in it, that will not change the path that Bitcoin is headed down.

So your savings collapsed last week?
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:17:49
Volatile is not a description you want on your savings. But do you.

Name three times you used bitcoin in the last two weeks 
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:15:25
Lmao you are so fucking woke. Keep holding them bags of internet Monopoly money.

Have you tried starting a business?

And then after it goes up in price, you’re gonna what, sell it for fiat? Is that what you mean by believing in it?
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:01:27
That is my point, you can’t predict ANYTHING about it’s future price.

No, those are NOT the only two outcomes. Bitcoin can become like any other payment service out there, just another Venmo/PayPal with “better tech” that nobody really gives a shit about aside from the possibility of getting rich quick.

So far, bitcoin has recovered from this collapse just as well as the Titanic rose from the bottom of the ocean.

If their supply chain only accepts fiat then yes they need to convert to fiat NO MATTER WHAT. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:22:36
No, you cannot assert that since it recovered before it will recover again. Making any claims as such is purely speculation.

Who the fuck told you that?
