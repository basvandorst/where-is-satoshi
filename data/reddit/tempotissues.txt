Banks can also collect data and profile you along with your addresses which is counterproductive to crypto.

He holds donations from a long time ago but that goes to his friends project building wells in Africa. I think it's a couple of hundreds of thousands of dollars now, I forget the actual figure.

Come on man. You know it's just metaphors. It's just how the dude talks. He has this exaggerated way of talking about everything. That's why I call him the average man's smart man. 
Only thing I like about him is his yearning to learn new shit. 
Edit: grammar

Problem is his alpha senses would kick in and when he knows you're trying to squeeze something out of him through his podcast he may retract. By this I mean that he has the mentality of neanderthal sometimes. 
*I don't learn what you teach me you fuck, I'll learn it on my own terms.* 
That's rogan for you. 
 
He is the least knowledgeable person on tech (from his past podcasts) and getting him to understand the tech behind it will be no good. 
What would help is getting someone from another field who has average tech inclination + large fan following in his/her métier such as Connor McGregor or insert any athlete/non tech celebrity and Andreas on at the same time. In such a scenario Andreas can handle the meaty questions and break it down in a way that a average tech head and Joe rogan both can understand. They should do a live experiment again like they did last time but this time with an alt coin. Just to show them how it works.

Nice try OP. 
If you could include jokes from a commoners perspective who does not know shit bout bitcoin and then build your act around it I think average person will appreciate it and get it a lot more. 
Not many know about forks and bitcoin cash. Maybe they did in that club you were at. 
Also where is this performance?

What movie is this. I've always wanted to rewatch it. 
Isn't it the one where the socially awkward thick glasses nerd gets all the money at the end.
