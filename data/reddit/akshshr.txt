You could have used this app to tell you where all the bitcoin accepted stores/atms are

[Bitcoin Accepted Here](
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:05:13
Sure! I can do Android! But I am fairly sure there is no such API right now
@_date: 2018-06-21 19:38:22
The app is free and no ads
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:49:34

Every week I write a ton of more code towards my 'Bitcoin accpeted here' Android application that lists all businesses in the world that accept Bitcoin, soon become a community thing as well as with chat functionality between fellow bitcoiners.

@_date: 2018-07-04 12:20:01
Lovely! Now if only we all can go in there and add a location or two where you know bitcoin is accepted!!

I think making coinbase seem like the bad player is the stupidest thing one can do in the crypot space
