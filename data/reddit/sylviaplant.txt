I recommended Coinbase to someone about two months ago. I had told them about Mtgox but they did not create an account at Gox. They did create an account on Coinbase. Oddly, they received an email from Gox the same night they created their CB account, though they had not given Gox any info.

Coinbase was pretty quick (read: 3-5 days, I think) at verifying me to buy BTC with USD, which can then be transferred to BTC-E.

They've responded to me, several times.

I had BTC in there back when I first learned of BTC. I left them in there awhile, then decided I wanted to get them out. Once I'd submitted my information they asked for, it took about two weeks and my account was verified. They say it takes longer if you're not in the USA. (They also say it takes ten days to verify, but it was longer than that.) I would try resubmitting the info, making sure it's exactly what they want.
If you're talking about verifying a bank account, though- from what I've heard it takes months to get cash out. Much better off to verify account, buy BTC if you have money in your account, and get the BTC out.

How long does the verification process take with them?

I'm getting this message as well, and downforeveryone.com confirms it's down. It loaded briefly for me, then I continued to get that message.

I looked back at the BTC I've actually purchased, then, uh, spent. A total of about 32BTC, gone not long after purchasing for $15 a piece. On the plus side, I didn't spend them ALL. Just almost.
