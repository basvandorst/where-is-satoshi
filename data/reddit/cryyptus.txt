I can't give you any real evidence on that but good conjecture would be the fact that it's not a fiat currency and if War became a thing it would be easily transitioned to another country

Give me a little bit but I'm attempting to get my Imgur account working so that I can upload photos of tabtrader where BTC is continuously climbing over the last 30 minutes. And no that doesn't mean it's a steady climb but it's risen nearly a hundred bucks in the time I'm downloading the Imgur app

I would say that for the day it will continue to rise Non-Stop with minor dips as people take minimal profits and attempt to push the price higher please note the 30-minute candle chart I'm linking for September 5th 2017

I'm the one that's down voting you because all you're doing is nay saying anything anyone has to say to refute what you're saying. I'm not the one that attacked nor cursed people out nor called them crazy or batshit paranoid. Take your childish troll Antics elsewhere we're here to discuss and debate the future of a currency that were invested in
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:11:16
No I've actually only been in the crypto Market a couple of months. Instead of following threads and social media I taught myself to read candle charts then invested $50 to play with and purposely lose just so that I can see what coins jump and fall. From there I used that knowledge make my own decisions because there is so much fud going around. I've always had a tendency to talk circles around things that excite me so went on places like Reddit or any other social media I try to break it down as short and simple as possible. But thanks I appreciate the compliment
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:05:59
Nope. No clue who that is however I will take it as a compliment even if the guy is a shitty person LOL I don't mind being confused with others. It means I'm doing something right or extremely wrong ������
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:39:16
 you've been you've been on Reddit for one week and although I don't normally make assumptions I'm going to assume that you've been into the Bitcoin game for less than a year. That was definitely a dip not a crash. Scrolled out word on the charts for the last year and you'll see that it is done so multiple times and it's always corrected itself. Hence a dip not a crash. A crash is long-term. A dip is a massive drop in price that lasts an extremely short time. Do your research before you comment on things like this. It's people like you that instill fud and everyone else when in reality they don't seem to know what they're talking about
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:16:23
I would say, yes its over for now. Take this as my opinion only but I feel like we'll see minor down Swings with an overall upswing
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:51:52
I didn't go crazy and I did respond to that. I just didn't respond with a reaction that you liked. You're the one that's going crazy and Nutters because somebody refuted what you said. And as for the word crash being used for years regardless of whether it was or wasn't it was inaccurate. A crash is a significant drop that is sustained for a long period of time. Regardless of what you have said or believe you are incorrect. You have the nerve to call us Nutters and crazy and you're the one getting angry and frustrated over someone disagreeing with you. You've resorted to name-calling and bashing which I in turn have done to you. You have also avoided commenting on or looking at the Hard Evidence I posted up at the top of this thread. Stop being a child. You can say what you want about words being used for years, but your opinion on something being used for years on Reddit is negligible considering your account is a week old. I've been following Bitcoin on Reddit for a lot longer than I've actually been on Reddit and I've seen the word dip used about 95% more often than the word crash. Is there anything I've missed? Or have I so offended your sensibilities that you'll argue over anything? Again I reiterate go look at my hard evidence that it is not a crash. I'm not mad that you called it a crash nor do I care one way or another I was just commenting with proof that it is not. People like you are the reason I don't post on Reddit very often. In four months all I've done is comment because people like you raise Hell over stupid ideas or thoughts. People like you have a 1% knowledge base and take that to make them an expert. I don't care what people called it at any given time in the past nor do I care how irate people get over what it's called now. What I do care about it simpletons like you trying to contradict me with no hard evidence or facts to back it up. If the word crash would used often and heavily over the last few years show me the proof not just your word against mine. Now as an addendum to what you said I have seen people questioned whether or not it was a crash or a dip quite a lot when there was a huge dip. Don't be that guy. Get evidence, show evidence, don't argue; debate. Win, lose, draw it's all the same to me. The outcome is negligible as long as I'm still making money. And your opinion won't affect that one way or another. So since you've been in Bitcoin since 2013 why don't you go cash out and while you're at it hash out of Reddit as well

I've been on Reddit for months and didn't know that you could get Negative Karma
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:00:23
Lol. Now THAT'S funny. I going to go out on a limb here and assume you didn't like my response. And I reiterate how you're attacking when you don't like someone's answer to what you have to say. Seriously dude you're acting like a child
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:27:24
Care to point out exactly what I'm ignoring? And why you're ignoring the candle charts I've posted above proving you wrong
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:24:17
Obligatory candle chart post for the last year proving that this is not a crash but only a dip.

@_date: 2017-09-05 15:44:03
Ffs, how many threads are you going to post this in?
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:20:36
I didn't cry I simply stated that you must be a millionaire by now because I can tell you that if I'd bought any more than one coin under $50 I would have sold it when it was at $5,000 just a couple of days ago taken my profit and reinvested it. Again you're resorting to name-calling and attacking. And yes I consider it bragging when you say, and I quote "I bought a bunch of coins for under $50". And again I reiterate more power to you I'm happy for you having that much money. It gives you time to trash-talk people. Seriously though you must not have anything better to do. I know I certainly don't until I have to clock into work tonight.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:14:45
If you bought your first coins in 2013 you'd be a Millionaire right now and would have cashed out and would know that this is not a crash but only a dip. Bye Felicia
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:03:44
Not at all. If you do, more power to you. Personally I don't need to brag about when I bought my coins nor how much I'm worth. You're the one that seems upset little buddy. Can I get a weigh in from the rest of the people in this thread? And even if I can't I'm going to point out that you're the one constantly attacking and calling names and trash talking. Why is it you ignored my entire post in response to you and suggested I go take my meds? LMFAO
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:07:37
Did you just explain the Chinese conversation and Trump speech? I see what you did there you get an up vote
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:58:50
I don't recall but isn't that the one where it dropped nearly $2,000? Sorry I had a long month or two new job and all
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:28:36
How about nah?
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:08:23
You haven't shown me that I was wrong and yes you bragged. You commented about how you bought a lot of coins under $50 then you proceeded to ask me whether I the mad about that. You're repeatedly attacking and calling names. You don't remotely bother me kiddo I just find it funny that you ignore everything I've said that's right and continue to attack slander and trash talk. Explain to me how you've shown me I'm wrong? Show me anywhere you've actually contradicted me and been right with proof. Ffs this isn't even annoying, I find it amusing. Truth be told I have nothing to do for the next 10 hours until I have to be at work. Keep them coming little buddy
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:50:20
Note the key phrase across a significant cross-section of the market which it did not. Very short-term. And if this place is insane why are you here even commenting
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:08:36
Oh I wasn't ignoring it however your comments are all over the place and so is this thread. Therefore I respond to what the app gives me notifications for. You must like stirring up trouble. I'm going to assume that you don't own any Bitcoin and it's people like you that instill fud in the market, considering it is mostly speculation these days
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:44:18
You're right it is absolutely hilarious to the guy who's been on here a week is trying to give people advice and called something a market crash that's quite clearly not a market crash. That's why BTC is sitting at $4,200 and climbing again. You should definitely look up the definition of market crash
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:32:58
Go check your original post and everything up above, then after you do get back under your Bridge
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:30:53
Or are you talking about this post because I've already responded to it I just didn't respond in line because your comments are all over the place. You know quite similar to the way mine are all over the place reload the entire thread and then go read through it. But I'll go ahead and comment on this again about how you should note the key phrase "across a significant cross-section of the market" because this dip did not significantly affect the market it bounced back within 24 hours. Again please note the candle charts I've posted at the top of this thread. Baka
