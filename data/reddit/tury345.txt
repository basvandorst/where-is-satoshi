Redditor discovers one weird trick, global investment industry hates him!

Also I think people should know that the key word here is "expected", all of this means that the market for bitcoin is adversarial in that buying or selling bitcoin based on speculation must be understood as being based on expectations that are more (bullish) or less (bearish) confident in bitcoin than the person on the other end of the transaction. 
It's very important to understand that you don't buy bitcoin because you think saturation rates will increase, you buy bitcoin because you think saturation rates will increase faster or farther than the rest of the market does. Even if saturation rates increase substantially, the price of bitcoin will actually decrease if they increase less than expected.

Following that logic, if bitcoin continued to rise in value, buying anything at all with any money is equivalent to buying something with bitcoin because whatever money you did spend could have been used to buy bitcoin. Given that the price of bitcoin has minimal effect on other currencies, I'm not sure that the conditions for a deflationary spiral are met. I think if anything it could be a good ol bubble that occurs whenever speculative price estimates are much larger than the underlying supply and demand functions dictate (i.e. when people are over confident in an assets inherent value).
Also, never confuse past results with future expectations, bitcoin prices today are dictated by what people expect from bitcoin in the future. If big news breaks today about something that will increase demand for bitcoin in 5 years, the price of bitcoin will reflect that news *today*. I don't know enough about bitcoin to speculate on the supply/demand but the generic ideas of finance still hold.

Can we just talk about the logic involved in .2-.4% driving it up to 25% of the global market cap, and *then* it grows by 350000%.

If we make the assumption that bitcoin is *guaranteed* to rise in USD price (pls don't assume this.), spending bitcoins actually makes the *most* sense because the alternative is not converting your USD into bitcoin to begin with. If someone asked to borrow any amount of money from you and pay you back twice that amount in a years time, you wouldn't lend them *all* of your money - same idea applies here.

Seriously though, current prices reflect all future growth expectations. Extrapolating asset prices based on trend lines is laughable. To be more specific, bitcoin is held by speculators, detaching the *current* price from being a function of the *current* saturation levels, the *current* price already reflects expected *future* saturation levels. The only way Bitcoin's (or any asset, I am not at all arguing against bitcoin specifically here) price will grow faster than the risk adjusted risk free rate (US bonds + a premium for bitcoin's level of risk) is in response to speculators revising their future adoption rate (adoption rate being the substitute for supply/demand in this case) expectations upwards. 
TL;DR OP only makes sense if the price of bitcoin only reflects current saturation rates, in reality the price of bitcoin will at any given moment in time reflect predictions for the eventual saturation rate as well as the speed at which it gets there at that same moment.
