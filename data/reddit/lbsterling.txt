Perhaps people who were never that enthusiastic about Segwit in the first place, but were willing to accept it as part of a two-part solution to alleviate blockchain congestion are no longer very eager to adopt it. These people may be disillusioned because they thought an increase in Bitcoin's blocksize - the other half of the solution - would also be forthcoming. After realizing that they had been willing to compromise on Segwit, but others were not willing to compromise on a blocksize increase, this part of the community gave up on having their voices heard. Hence they are not devoting resources to developing "Segwit" , which they never really wanted in the first place.
That's my theory.

We see things the same way. It's ironic that suddenly the companies who supported S2X are being excoriated for not doing essentially what they argued should be done in the first place. S1X'ers should realize that actions -- and being uncompromising fanatics -- may have consequences further down the road. Imagine if exchanges, small blockers and big-blockers had checked their politics at the door and agreed on some version of a S2X compromise in 2016.

I know you're trying to bring some civility to the debate, and I come down on the side of larger blocks myself, but I can't resist picking apart your post: this is the Internet after all.
Ad Hominems are a form of logical fallacy ... but only when they are *irrelevant* attacks or insults. If I argue in favor of school lunches, pointing out that I run a catering company is germane. Understanding where Maxwell (and Andresen) works is certainly part of the picture.
"Bait and Switch" is a form of sales fraud, not a debating tactic. You have several muddled ideas here ... you conclude correctly that Satoshi is not infallible and warn against the Appeal to Authority (?). But your main thrust seems to be a plea against making faulty interpretations. The example you give (the meaning of the text of the second amendment) is, somewhat comically, one where reasonable people disagree.
Maybe you just want to make the small point that you think it's dubious when people claim Satoshi didn't want to eventually scrap the blocksize limit? I would agree with that...
But it seems more likely you are warning generally against making arguments you see as stretched or tendentious. The problem of course is that nobody will ever see their own arguments as such.
"Fear of something else."
Again, this looks like normal debate to me: invoking possible consequences of actions taken (or not taken). Why would noting that a hard fork is required to increase blocksize be an "underhanded" debating tactic? 
How about just saying you think a hard fork is not a plan that should be rejected out of hand?
Or saying that, in your view, small block advocates lack credibility when they accept hard forks in one context but reject them in another?

No. The debt will have been exchanged for equity. Depositors already have first call on Gox's assets. So, they agree to shares in the new exchange and take a 90 percent haircut (which is better than nothing). The fiat and BTC remaining in Gox are used to launch the new exchange.

Look at it this way. Current holders are agreeing to take a 90 percent haircut at the get-go (because that's more than they'll get in bankruptcy after lawyer fees) in exchange for shares in a new exchange, whose assets now match liabilities.

@_date: 2014-02-28 08:27:51
This question comes up 10 times below, I think because people are confused by the terms "assets" and "liabilities" which have nearly the opposite meaning in banking as they do in everyday business.
Depositors are bank CREDITORS and rank very high in seniority in their claim on the valuable parts of an insolvent Gox. So, the goal is really to launch a new exchange with what remains of Gox's holdings. The quicker this happens, the more people stand to recover as opposed to allowing lawyers to siphon off all remaining BTC/Fiat _ which is exactly what usually happens in most long, drawn-out bankruptcy processes.

Finally it's (just) my opinion, and a guess, so take it for what it's worth: police from the US and elsewhere have all information that was stored at Mt.Gox and they're taking their time to scour it and figure out who they want to bust (for whatever reasons). They're going to sort that out before they ever allow any BTC or cash to be returned.

Text Part One)
Thirteen of the world’s biggest banks are preparing to launch digital versions of major global currencies in 2020 after years of research convinced them that the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies could be used to make trading less risky and cheaper.
The UBS-led research on a “utility settlement coin” (USC) has been in the ether since 2015, when banks decided to investigate whether wholesale banking could be made more efficient by deploying distributed ledger technology (DLT).
DLT, which is used in blockchain networks, enables participants to instantly share information on
an open-access ledger which can never be altered or erased.
The technology could theoretically replace reams of paperwork and processing, but banks must
first confront legal and regulatory hurdles on everything from risk management to privacy before
deploying it widely.
“When we started out . . . this project has basically been about R&amp;D, we didn’t know if the characteristics [we wanted to achieve] were possible,” said Rhom Ram, head of Fnality, the new venture into which the banks and exchange Nasdaq have just invested £50m to create a market infrastructure to transfer value digitally.

You have a very strange conception of S2X being "glommed on" to BTC. If both have value after the split, it *means* that the unified BTC owes part of its value to S2X *before* the split. In essence you *already* own the future both, or the future one (once the other fails). I really don't understand your resentment of 2X. This disagreement about Bitcoin's direction has existed for three years; longer actually. It's baked into the system.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:28:46
Isn't the key takeaway that the bitcoin 'community' will never have consensus on a hardfork?
Don't get me wrong, I'm a gracious loser (supported 2X) and I will now shut down my node, resubscribe here and ditch r/btc. To me, Bitcoin has cemented its future: as a store of value, not a medium of exchange. This is a boon to Bitcoin. But it's also a boon to alt coins with different technologies (not BCH)  that will now surpass Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. My view.

I think you just need to, like, hold. One or other chain will prevail, and then no problem. Or they'll both survive and one way or the other the two networks will diverge (whether by proof of work change on S1X or easy splittin' tools or one side installing replay connection).  So don't stress.

“The funding signals that it is possible,” he added. “The investors believe it is possible based on the evidence they have seen.”
Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investments at UBS’s investment bank, said the research showed the USC would soon be used for clearing and settling trades and could ultimately prove “transformational” for trading.
“We see a way of actually reducing the risk significantly in the post trade world,” he said, referring to the settlement, credit and counterparty risks banks take on between the time that trades are instructed and when the money and assets actually change hands. “All of these things play into costs, operational efficiency and the balance sheet.”
Lee Braine, an executive at Barclays’ chief technology office, said his bank’s confidence in the project’s viability had “meaningfully” increased since it joined the effort a year-and-a-half ago.
Other big banks involved in the project include Santander, BNY Mellon, MUFG, Credit Suisse, KBC, ING and Canada’s CIBC.
The USC will begin life with 14 owners and members, and will be denominated in major global currencies including the US dollar, yen, euro and sterling. Every unit of a dollar-denominated USC will be backed by a traditional dollar at the Federal Reserve, and the same model will be used with other currencies, ensuring the value of the coin is stable.
Its initial applications will be in relatively niche areas, such as creating a market infrastructure that allows the coins to be used to meet margin requirements in derivatives trades. Mr Ram said while at present it took at least a day for such requirements to be satisfied, using the USC the process could become almost instantaneous.
Mr Braine said that while the size of the founding banks meant their efforts would have “traction” from launch, the impact would not be a “big bang”. “This ultimately is a market transformation over time,” he said.
Japanese banks are also working on a digital coin — the J Coin — but they are focusing on retail banking, as is social media giant Facebook, which is developing a coin pegged to the dollar which could be used to instantly transfer value between Facebook users.

Please. Sit back and think about it for a while. From now on, getting enough consensus for a hard fork is going to be all but impossible. That's not bad: the Bitcoin protocol is immutable and written in stone, that's a huge part of its value proposition. Second layer solutions will be possible. Soft forks will be possible (witness: Segwit, pun intended). But not hard forks.

"Even if there isn't 100 pct consensus". Yes. There will never be anything approaching 100 pct consensus. The 'majority rule' model of adding features works for soft forks and second layer solutions. But not the Bitcoin protocol. Large swaths of the Bitcoin community will be for this and that -- but they will lack the power to enforce their will on those that refuse. Put a fork in hard forks for Bitcoin, they're done.

He is an economist who very accurately saw the housing bubble and eventual crash; his criticisms of Bitcoin, run a range from reasonable criticisms to outright distortions. He's emotive (give him the benefit of the doubt) because he ) calling out something he sees as fraud and b) he's highly ego-invested in his stance.
I hesitate to wax academic, but something that I've found really useful in life is understand how opinions change, specifically, how scientific opinions change. I'm referring to "paradigm shift", worth reading the wikipedia page if you never had, even more worth reading Kuhn's original paper if you're willing to sit.
But so you can go back and look at Einstein's theories and find brilliant physicists debunking them, tearing them apart as nonsense.
But the way progress works is like this: often a new idea (Bitcoin) will come from a new thinker in a lateral field (Satoshi) and seem LESS good in many ways to what went before it, especially to experts in the old paradigm (Keynsian economics, fiat money, debt based finance). And the defenders of the old paradigm (Roubini) will have some good arguments against the new idea.
However, the what the new paradigm will do specifically is solve some of the pressing problems with the old system or theory. ("a second bailout for banks")
And for that reason, one group of experts in the old field, usually a minority, will see the potential benefits of the new idea (economist: 'holy Christ the computer scientists have invented a way to teleport gold!) and start working on it.
The weird part of all this is that, in middle phase, there will be very good arguments against the new idea and uncertainty about who is right. There will be flaws, or at least apparent flaws in the new theory, for instance 51 pct attacks, not clear how it can scale, used for undesirable forms of trade, not clear what will happen once inflation ends. That's where someone like Roubini comes in.  
But eventually the new idea becomes its own branch of science. Usually not totally superseding the old one and incorporating it (as Einstein's theory's did to Newton's) but more that both exist side by side as separate categories, each usually useful in its own particular circumstances. Einstein didn't change ballistics for the military, but he will become a lot more important if we ever attempt interstellar travel.
So what happens to people like Roubini? It's rare that he would suffer an abrupt conversion and see the potential of cryptocurrency. More likely he will remain antagonistic to Bitcoin. But the next generation of economists won't have the same emotional attachment to the old worldview. They'll certainly study fiat; Keynsian and other forms of economics. But they'll also study Bitcoin and the new forms of trade and economics it engenders.

You're actually just arguing that the supply of dollars in the world is fixed (wrong, but not important). Arti214 is correct, from the point of view of the bitcoin "investor", in his scenario, or any scenario where the price rises, the total result is net positive and it is not a zero sum game. Let the gains in his example all be realized if that helps you understand.
Substitute the word "stocks" for bitcoin throughout if that helps you understand.
If that still doesn't help, consider the following case in which you would actually be correct: if the price of bitcoin eventually falls to $0. *Then* the bitcoin game will have been zero sum, from perspective of fiat.

You're getting there. Baby steps. 
The first half of your post falsely equates bitcoin, which is a thing that has been created in the world that adds utility and so has had increasing value, with poker, which is a game where at the end, money is merely redistributed between players. The comparison would only make sense if the price of bitcoin falls to zero in the end. But that is not necessarily the case.
The second half of your post is accurate. Investing in the market is not a zero sum game, because over time assets increase. (bravo!) And yes, trying to beat any average is a zero sum game. 
But "investing" in bitcoin is not trying to beat the return of any average.
Purchasing Bitcoin with dollars does not change the supply of dollars, that's true. But if the price of bitcoin rises and remains higher, the total value of all assets in the world has increased.
You could compare it with building and selling a house. The builder pays $50,000 to purchase materials, adds labor, then sells it for some price, $100,000. 
Then five years later it is sold for $150,000. And five years later it is sold for $200,000.
Is that a zero sum game?
Bitcoin is no different, it is only something less tangible.
The miners (and programmers) are the builders. The purchasers are bitcoin "investors."
Finally, to return to why the bitcoin game is additive: if you view the entire universe of all possible assets in all financial markets as one entity then yes, it's possible that bitcoin investors will wind up having acquired more of than others over time.
But that does not imply the others in the universe have been disadvantaged in any way. The universe has simply grown; they may own a lesser percentage of it than bitcoin investors (or a greater percentage, depending on how they invest). But net wealth is increased.
I hope the penny drops for you someday.

The translations were no doubt "Google-assisted" but I think at least edited by native speakers. The efficiency of all this is amazing, and I never had to show a credit card or any other BS. 
The website sells reflective paint in Europe  (in WordPress) and I'm ashamed to say I don't take BTC yet because the BitPay plugin is buggy (for me) but we will and offer a discount of course.

With all respect to the author, the answer is most obviously C). With interest rates near zero, it's hard for banks to make money. They can borrow short and cheap, but they can't lend long and dear.

Executive summary: they ask the question of why banks are worth less now than before the crisis and answer
A) Because they were overvalued then
B) Because they are still undercapitalized (despite having more now and passing various tests)
C) Because their future profits are doubtful

You seem a little hysterical, which undermines your credibility.

Economics. Because BTC supply is so limited, and demand is so high, people will seek out anything that seems similar to 'kind of' expand the supply ("substitution effect"). But because the fate of altcoins is (almost) totally dependent on that of the original, any hint of trouble for BTC suggests the others are much more likely to end up worthless. 
When BTC thrives, the odds that there is at least some role or use for the others increases, so they catch some of the same exponential value growth that BTC has.
It may leave a nasty taste in your mouth, but if you have held BTC and seen massive gains, there's an argument for diversifying some small % into other altcoins. As insurance against BTC having problems that one of the others is able to overcome. For that reason I expect the altcoins to continue into the foreseeable future. And I predict some of them will find uses, maybe unexepected ones.

I would say: don't panic. At this point, there's so much speculative money rolling into Bitcoin that almost anything that can be done to slow it down would be a good thing. The network effects for BTC are insurmountable. But what it needs is more adoption and more user-friendly applications, growing the ecosystem. Don't worry about Litecoin, its fate will be determined by BTC only.
