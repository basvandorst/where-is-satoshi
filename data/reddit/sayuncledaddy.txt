I try really hard to not pick sides between BTC and BCH, but if there is any reason for me at all its because of Ver, himself.  Jameson Lopp, however, is extremely well spoken and I would say his points were much better made.  Yup, he owned Ver.

I have a double major in economics and metaphysics (the study of being, I will tell you what it is so you don't to get confused).  I am anything but uneducated and I paid for it all myself, not the government.  Furthermore, I am a 1% that makes well over 6 figures a year votes Democrat, so you really just have no idea who I am or what I am about.  That's right, this selfish fuck votes against his own best financial interest.
The ONLY LEGITIMATE taxes are assessed.  Title 26, the internal revenue code, was never voted on by congress, it is a defacto law that is only enforceable to the extent the people are willing to comply, so it is actually the exact perfect thing to call this person and you people "Stockholm Babies" because you are actually complying and defending a system that has taken you hostage, and you don't even know it.
The United States Government is failing to support its people.  The bang for your buck in terms of what you get for what you pay is a total crock of shit.  I know you wish to want them to help you, but unless you are a minority or a woman your chances of getting much help are slim to none and even that is waning.  You can probably get a free, useless, degree at a community college - I am not calling it useless because its community college, I am calling it useless because anyone who rests on the laurels of their own degree is subjugating themselves to a system that doesn't work.  Sure go to college to learn some stuff, but do it for you and your goals as an independent person, not a person seeking an enslavement messiah because the days of 50 year anniversaries are over, as are 40, 30 and 20...you may be lucky to get 10.  I mean, the United States Incarceration rate is so high how could anyone make it to 50 or even 20.
The world has been disrupted.  You can do better delivering for Amazon, driving for Lyft, and doing food deliveries than most people can with their degrees, so what is the point?  And I am not even trying to set the bar that low.  I have been self employed since I was 14, it is the only way to go.  Though I realize Stockholm Babies are probably so dumb they can't fight their way out of a wet paper bag and therefore will never make it self employed, nor will they make it employed because you are probably also the same type of idiots who fear credit rather than embrace it as a tool for making you wealthy and super hope their employers to value them.
As for my ideal world, I want bang for my buck.  As a top wage earner and tax payer I want to see who benefits from my dollars.  I certainly don't want it going to toothless, soulless, white bread families, mindlessly breeding their crotch fruit to be wanna be warriors enlisting to help their government fight false enemies.  Absent the gluttonous and wrathful expenditures of the US military our taxes could be at a level that they wouldn't be worth fighting over.  
And they could do it legitimately too through sales tax and property taxes ~ the only legitimate taxes, those that are assessed rather than enforced through duress by making examples of unwitting people who are not smart enough to defend themselves against what requires only "voluntary compliance."
And if you don't agree with me because you aren't a United States Citizen then you have absolutely no moral ground on which to base your argument against my protest and I will not pretend to assume your governments inappropriately represent you in exchange.
Maybe you should try living your life under the assumption that all your whitebread, suburbian, conformist wannabe ideals are based on total bullshit.  Maybe you just have never met someone like me, someone that has the balls to vote against their own best financial interest.  Someone who can say "I don't agree with the ethic of ripping off another simply because they don't know any better or don't have a choice, I am happy with what I am getting rather than what I could get."  We are out there though, this world's unappreciated philosophers and idealists...but I doubt the likes of you will ever have the balls to see us because its much easier for you and your ego to judge someone in the context of your false ideals.  
That is, its much easier for you to succumb to what your ego tells you because you lack the ability to see the obsolescence of your ego in this modern world much less the hypocrisy of letting your ego run rampant in the context of the ideals you espouse ~ a brotherhood of man through all us paying taxes that were never even ratified as a law.

I am not a conspiracy theorist because I have actual tax knowledge and you do not.  You are literally and metaphorically not more of an American than me because you proudly pay illegitimate taxes that I am aware are illegitimate.  Not appreciating the way my tax money is spent does not somehow roll out the red carpet for my exodus to another country.  In fact, I have every right to stay here and make it better rather than my exodus.  And, on the contrary, idiots like you who fail to grasp the hypocrisy between wishing to want to be a nationalist by proudly inviting me to leave because your "American morals" are stronger than mine while simultaneously failing to recognize that abolishing a tax system like the one we have now is one one of the purposes this country exists.  Its total idiotic hypocrisy.  You are and idiot.  And I will continue to hate brainwashed, Stockholm Syndrome Babies like yourself.
I do not agree they have a right to deduct taxes.  You apparently didn't read anything I said before.  Title 26, The Internal Revenue Code, was NEVER VOTED ON BY CONGRESS.  They literally, legally do not have this right. Aside from alcohol and tobacco, THE ONLY LEGITIMATE TAXES ARE ASSESS/LEVIED by a taxing authority. End of story, even if you wish to not want to believe it.  
If YOU don't agree, you move somewhere else where they have an actual legitimate income tax code that was actually voted on by congress.  In the meantime, I will continue doing what I do, which often includes opening the eyes of mind-raped individuals like yourself to use tax law to benefit them.

In the case of cryptos, yes, a $5 pocket calculator could do my job, except a $5 calculator cannot suffice as an official document being used by a judge in a case where two parties disagreeing on the value of something are mandated by law to obtain a professional opinion, generally an appraiser.  
There is more to being an appraiser than just performing kindergarten math, which I agree applies to this situation.  However, in both cases, some party needed a signed and certified document and only a person with a certification can do that.  But  there are more lines of code that regulate real estate appraisers, like me, than there are regulating any other profession in the country and on every single report, regardless of the level of math performed, I am bound to those regulations.  You really are showing your ignorance here.  Not having respect for a profession and the profession not being valuable are two separate things.  I am use to people not respecting appraisers, one reason we are in such low supply, thankfully, because its the reason that when we are needed people pay us ridiculous amounts of money.  
Tata, shitbag.

You sound like a complete idiot.  I have a masters degree in economics and I am a real estate appraiser.  If you can't accept that my degree and day to day life make me competent at spotting the broad economic forces and factors of value that affect cryptos then you are a sad, sad, idiot who will go through life likely never mastering anything since you can't hear something from people with, presumably, more experience. 
"Crypto markets don't have appraisers."  Yes, they do. 
"They're naturally resolving."  Even if it were true does that somehow exempt them from the broad economic forces and factors of value?  
"I disregard what other people say."  So go ahead and vote for Trump in 2020 and build that wall, bobo.  
"If you aren't technical enough to understand what it is you are buying..."  I will try to get more technical and stuff for you, but as a 40 year old who has been mining for 3 years, in the winter, and replaced my furnace with miners, I think I am probably a little ahead of my time and the curve.  Of course that is irrespective of the multi billion dollar app I am developing, the result of my ignorant, inexperienced ass observing a market that could be disrupted.
I've read your past posts.  They are full of attacking people for no reason.  To me you seem like a basic idiot who is a caricature of yourself mindlessly going through life failing to understand the difference between having a reason to react and an opportunity to react.  You get all your opportunities, I am sure, and nobody will ever successfully rob you of that.
So..."yeah, no."

Historically you may be right that those baubles preceded cows, however our entire system of phsyical ownership is actually based on cattle, the norman variant of chatel and now chattel.  There are two types of physical ownership: Real Estate and Chattel - everything that isn't real property.

So....like...demand and supply apply to bitcoin too?  If quantity supplied (people selling) increases, then price drops?  Its almost like we are experiencing a...mar...a mark....a market...under the same economic principles that shadow every other market.
Wait.  Sweet!
Also, your example of $100 going to $100,000 isn't quite accurate.  If the price increases 1000% then the market has justification for a time adjustment.  So the next sweater should hypothetically (and in this extremely limited supply of commodity sweater example you used - wait - limited supply...where have I heard that before) sell for $1,000,000, and then only two sweaters have sold bringing the total into the market to $1,001,100.  Now the next buyer thinks thats just insane so the next one sells for $10,000 and the total injected is $1,011,100, and the average value per coin is $10,111...wait similar to the last price paid.  I am an appraiser, while I understand this is an extremely rudimentary explanation of how the market works, so is your 100 sweater explanation.  
But yes, you are right, supply and demand impact every market.  Its the underlying basis for all perceived value and all value is perceived.

There was no argument about technical.  You said "If you aren't technical enough to understand what it is you're buying then you probably shouldn't be buying it" to which I replied I will try to be more technical and stuff for you.  But what you didn't realize is that "technical and stuff" was a reference to how stupid you sounded.  I have been engaged two times as an appraiser to value crypto currency.  Once for an estate and once for a divorce.  I am just one appraiser.  Cryptos are defined as property in most countries.  Any property can be valued by any appraiser.  If two people get a divorce this year when bitcoin is at $7500 and one year down the road when the divorce is finalizing, the wife wants the bitcoin to be valued at $20,000 but the husband says "it was worth only $7500 when the divorce was filed."  The wife disagrees, nobody else knows wtf bitcoin even is so the judge orders an appraisal.  Suppose someone wants a 20% return on investment and is seeking a coin that provides that through proof of stake, they may ask an appraise, "what price do I have to buy NEO coin at to get a 20% ROI for year 1?"  Its really not that complex.  People order all sorts of appraisals for all sorts of purposes that I am sure your youth hasn't even yet imagined.  But twice, twice already and being just one appraiser, I have been engaged to value cryptos.  It was some of the easiest jobs I ever had because it was such a mystery to everyone involved, especially the estate.
Its like I said from the get go, if you can't accept something that someone says with far more experience in a field than you have, you will likely die a sad sad person with no mastery of anything.  But up until this point I hadn't realized your meth riddled eyes were waiting for a "technical argument" because I was actually making fun of you when I said "technical and stuff." 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:41:25
Are you blind?  I was engaged twice as an appraiser.  Once for a divorce and once for an estate (due to the death of an owner). I found 5 transactions from 5 exchanges, including localbitcoins, at the time the divorce was filed or at the time of the effective date of the estate.  
I am just one appraiser.  I can only assume others have been engaged.  I'm not even a personal property appraiser and people still sought me out, I am a real estate appraiser.

How is the risk any different?  Wouldn't a person with no money, who is banking on an asset to increase in value, who is constantly adding little by little to increase their ownings be better off by obtaining the asset now, enjoying the appreciation now, and pay it off little by little?  I understand you may be too conditioned to understand the way credit works, but let me sum it up for you, don't bother arguing:  You use credit to obtain assets that generate income or value at a rate higher than the interest of the credit.  You do not use credit to buy things you want/need.  
I buy condos on 0% credit cards and transfer back and forth, generally costing myself 2.4% interest to buy houses with credit that I don't have to pay underwriting fees, brokerage fees, appraisal fees, etc, nor do I have to get scrutinized to do it.  I look for 10% ROI, a 7.6% spread on other people's money.

I have 0 debt and 5 rental properties, 35.8 bitcoin, 297 litecoin, 2110 ethereum and I make between 12,500 to 21,000 a month in my job, for which I am self employed.  I could retired tomorrow but it wouldn't be enough to live out my fantasy of disrupting the social structure.  
My appetite for risk and experimentation has paid off very well, I am not even 40.  To me you sound like someone who grew up in a military family listening to Dave Ramsey.  But slow and steady does not win the race.  "Slow and steady wins the race" is a trap for the mind-raped and herded.
Having 200,000 in available revolving debt all of which is dying to lend to me at 0% with a 3% fee for 18 months is my golden ticket, I don't even need to win the lottery.  Every single one of these assets I have earned in the last 5 years (all the cryptos, 2 of the properties) were purchased on 0% credit cards.  I remind you, credit cards are unsecured debt, so there isn't really risk at all.  If I fail all it does is hurt my credit, they can't do anything to me...its unsecured.
You should maybe spend some time thinking about this stuff.  Everything I have said could very well set you free on some level, at least.  Have fun.

I would say that throughout the entire history of BTC most transactions are traders almost without exception...that is, I doubt there has ever been a day in BTC history where BTC as a currency was used more times than BTC by traders.  Therefore, I am forced to wonder if the same low volume theory that applies to stocks is currently a very positive sign for BTC.
