Directly from their blog:
As you may know, we are currently working on a basic HTTPS API. We have already pushed the documentation live, so you can start planing your applications. The problem with APIs is that once publicly available, there is no easy way to change it without upgrading to a new API version. Therefore, we have tried to make our first version as stable as possible, and we will try to avoid version upgrades more than twice a year.
Currently, our timeline is:
June, 7th: API will be made public in alpha state, expect minor changes.
Mid June: Beta release; No more changes, only bug-fixes.
End June/Early July: Stable version of our API (Version 1.0)

I'm sure many people think the same thing, decentralization should indeed be one of the strong points of this currency, but I fear that, because of how our socio-economic system is shaped centralization may happen anyway. I hope things will change before that happens.
