thanks but not exactly what i was looking for. im searching for a written code some software that is automated in real time for online shopping. not a fixed bitcoin price of an item but a software that gives the most accurate real time price. the shopper should be able to buy knowing this is worth $20 usd up to the last second they order goes thru

not exactly what i was looking for that's pretty much how anyone who accept bitcoin on they website does it. what i'm looking for is something that pushes bitcoin ecommerce. every item should have a real time feed of BTC/USD if i'm buying a $7000 piece of hardware the feed shouldnt say $7000/ 1 BTC  it should continuously be updated to reference the price in btc up to the very last second.
if you have a twitter app account twitter updated so you dont have to refresh to see the new RT and likes count you can automatically see it go up or down in real time without refreshing the page 
if someone is viewing a page that has 10 shirts on it the btc price should move in real time to reflecting the price page for each item

for example right now there isnt any rules to shopping in bitcoin online. as far as refunds go and do the customer get refunded back in BTC or USD. somewhere along the line i'll call C-Commerce rules will be in affect

hey thanks for commenting. no this isn't about me so cashing it out or keeping it will be irrelevant in this conversation this is solely about user and customer experience. lets say you were online shopping on you favorite website and they happen to take bitcoin. with the bitcoin websites setup today there is a fixed amount in bitcoin for a item for example
this T shirt &gt; 1 btc 
but what i want is a software that has a real time feed up to the last second when a shopper order goes thru. everytime the page refreshes it should display the most up to date BTC/USD price

yea that's the thing i'm not looking for a fixed BTC price and i understand me as the merchant will bare the risk but this experiment is going to try and push ecommerce for crypto and i said try because it could be a failed experiment but one we will know doesn't work when applied to real world use
