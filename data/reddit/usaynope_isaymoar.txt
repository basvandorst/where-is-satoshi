Don't forget that a major force in gold's value is jewelry. Check out Indian familial traditions, and you'll see why they're the largest holder of gold right now on earth. 
The value of gold is that it's availability is a fixed, low amount. No interest can create more. Various levels of mining work are it. If you gathered every ounce of gold mined in human history, it'd be a cube 20.7 m to a side. We've all seen diving pools that big.

Very true. This was my thought process. If gold doesn't have an intrinsic value, what does? Family members, maybe, but things and objects, even information, is only subjectively valuable.

The number of bit coins might be arbitrarily fixed, but they were made once, and more can be created. We created artificial diamonds, but we'll never manage to create more gold. This rarity is a crucial part of any value, almost being arguable as an intrinsic value.
Gold's an odd element...an excellent conductor of electricity and heat, corrosion-proof and very malleable/ductile, we use it in countless industrial applications, most notably phones, like the one I'm typing on. But those are ascribed values, discovered uses. I'd say gold's only intrinsic value is it's beauty, its never-faltering lustre. And even that's arguably a culturally instilled value.
So then, if an externally fixed availability doesn't count, and we ignore uses in technology, what would you say is something that has intrinsic value?
