I don't really get how people cannot understand smaller amounts of btc. I mean, it's not that difficult to understand there're smaller amounts aswell, is it?

I'm happy that Elon Musk kind of likes btc, he's a great guy. And I don't believe that Trump cares about btc, his presidency and family keep him busy, it's WallStreet who will fight against btc.

I spent $600 worth of btc just before the fast increase..
@_date: 2016-12-27 00:53:29
