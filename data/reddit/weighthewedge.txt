That's a great point.  Unfortunately our budget is very limited.  We are at Rutgers in Camden, New Jersey.  We are able to pay tolls, parking and food.  As for hotels and gas, we really don't have enough to cover this without dipping into our own pockets.  If any of that changes, I will update this post.  For everyone who has already contacted me, I really appreciate it.

So mining difficulty has risen 354% in the last 3 months.  Is that referring to how difficult it is to get those 25 coins?
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:47:17
is my address the same no matter what wallet I use?  I guess I am confused about where the coins go.  Do I have a set address no matter what or can I have coins in 10 different places?
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:51:26
thank you

I finally understand the address concept.  Took me a bit to wrap my head around it.
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:26:59
Ok so I'll get electrum generate an address and transfer my bitcoin-qt funds to electrum using that address.  That makes sense.
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:54:26
once i finish syncing with bitcoin-qt can the small transfers ive already gotten be easily transferred to an electrum wallet?
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:50:44
thank you, great info...i'll work my way through it

I need to start mining because I really don't have the liquid assets to be gambling on this right now haha
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:51:14
thank you
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:25:52
thank you!

so it is quite similar to the stock market and other money and commodity markets.  very interesting.
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:08:47
thanks!!! I downloaded bitcoin-qt...i assume i have to wait until i get an address to accept the .50?
@_date: 2013-08-23 12:17:26
i let it go all night and I'm at 80%.  At this point i guess i should just let it finish since I already used an address generated by it for a transaction?
@_date: 2013-08-23 10:52:07
Alright got it, thanks!
@_date: 2013-08-23 10:57:05
So it is completely on the owner of the bitcoins to remember where they stored them.  If people forget about one of their wallets, and never remember, are those coins out of circulation forever?  I guess what I am getting at is...there will eventually be 21 million bitcoins, if a bunch have been forgotten about, they are gone?  Also, I guess it doesn't really matter if people forgot because it's on the block ledger so it still exists, its not like a dollar bill being lit on fire.  Sorry, had to talk myself through that one.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:09:33
I think I did it correctly. We will see what happens when my bitcoin-qt client finally syncs 
@_date: 2013-08-23 10:58:19
great, thanks!
@_date: 2013-08-23 10:53:32
I can completely understand why.  I have a finance background so I completely understand the financial portion.  I'm having the most trouble with the coding and technical stuff.
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:20:23
This $.50 i was just given...I accepted it.  Where does it go?
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:09:06
thank you!
@_date: 2013-08-23 10:54:19
thanks! very kind of you

This sync takes foreverrrrrr...Do I have to wait for this sync every time I open the app or is it a 1 time thing?  If it's every time I might try out multibit or electrum.
