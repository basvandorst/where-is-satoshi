Isn't segwit and bitcoin cash both forks off of bitcoin but bitcoin segwit kept the btc ticker?

I feel sorry for you guys, alot of you don't understand what Bitcoin was originally about and what gave it's appeal. It's already sad that it's now being declared a store of value when it was that as a side effect of it's intial use.

I got into Bitcoin as a teen and when it was new and barely released. I also know how and why I got into it and how btc changed much in the wrong that it feels like a alt coin. I got in when the risk was very high unlike today when time has shown it's endurance. In my opinion Bitcoin cash feels more like Bitcoin than than btc does.

The true Bitcoin is Bitcoin cash now. Core is still in the idea faze with less utility than it had in the past.

Most people use there inflationary currencies to purchase temporary consumables that have little to no productive investment value spending there money in the present than saving for the future to retire and live off there past earnings. The people that do invest into productive Investments tend to do well off oftwn becoming in comparison rich and have money saved up for a future retirement because they sacrificed the joys and use of there money early on that paid back in the future ,because of this trend  this led to social programs that takes money from those that worked hard , risked there investment and sacrificed the use of it to trade off for a inefficient program give to those that might as worked as hard but didn't want to risk anything or sacrifice there use of that same income.  Basically like a group project of 4 in school and 2 do all the work while the other 2 help alittle or not at all and expect the same grade at the end. The thing about deflationary currency it takes advantage people's greed and causes them to horde said money because of this they'll end up having money saved up for the future that is still valuable or more valuable then. People that invest and take risk we'll still invest and take risk no matter, if anything it would make the investment more profitable because the Investments more valuable, if it's deflationary or inflationary some people like me just enjoy buying and selling. Also because it's no longer at a 3rs parties control how valuable there currency is the people have control of their labor once again and it works back on free-market principles.

This is the problem with bitcoin current community. People here these days don't understand why bitcoin was originally supported and why gold and silver is so important as well and won't be going away and is complintary invest with bitcoin (bch)

Lol that's a small drop talk to me when we go from 1200 to 90 to 1200 plus

They are not dependent of each other we just currently use it to compare it to something we are already programed on using , because people have a good idea what $1 will buy and a good idea what $100 will buy. Once Bitcoin becomes the norm that comparison will be less and less . A good example is when you go to a foreign country and trying to learn what there money worth and normally you try to compare their 1 peso , yuan , yen ,etc to what your country money worth such as 1 usd equals 50 pesos. That way you know that a piece of gum isn't worth 1000 pesos.

Like I mentioned fait used because that's what we're familiar with. Eventually things will fall into place as well think of it this way how did we decide what $1 can buy , like how do we decide that a soda equals $1. Same thing with Bitcoin eventually once Bitcoin becomes mainstream it'll be the same situation this service or product equals this amount of the coins. This isn't such a far-fetched idea because gold and silver used to be treated this way. We're just really used to the fiat currency that's why it's a little bit hard to grasp.

The war on crypto has already truly started btce was only the first under the banner of mtgox or money laundering and they did that with no jurisdiction in the area the guy was arrested. Prepare my friends for winter is coming.

That video was made in 2015, also every time it crashed it was within a few months , bitcoin been going for almost the whole year, this is different then last time but i'm not saying we're not going to see a short term correction that will cause panic selling
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:02:37
Yeah time for high speed centralized transactions that may fail or get stuck, but at least it's fast and cheaper then just segwit alone.  Time to show all the other alts why bitcoin reigns supreme

Contact trezor about it , but i know during the holidays months over here alot of shipping companies rent out alot of vans and trucks from rental companies like uhaul because there current fleet isn't big enough for all the incoming business, but its always best to be safe then sorry so make sure you ask trezor to confirm everything and possibly do a exchange.

This community is below bitcoin cash I rate it at litecoin level.
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:44:54
Sad this is all bitcoin has become something that already happened more then half a year ago and they still can only talk about a person promoting it then then talking about the  tech. The way they keep bashing it , it feels like the see it as a actual threat.

Something tells me the CEO or owner was bag holding bitcoins to score some extra cash then the price dropped.

Buy a hardware wallet , keep your coins off the exchange unless your doing a trade and once done remove them. I'm currently sweating bullets and stressing hard during this btce fiasco . Funny thing is I got my hardware wallet a few days before this happened but due to lack of time didn't do it. I know "if" btce comes back I'm transferring right away.

Eth is crap price only high because people are ignorant of its technology. Not knowing that it  doesn't have a hard cap meaning it's basically a digital Fiat. Eventually hype will go down, the demand will go down and Supply will be at all time high and growing avoiding scarcity.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:58:52
Keep poking it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:30:19
Lol and dropping coin values because eth doesn't have a limited supply but unlimited amount of coins.
