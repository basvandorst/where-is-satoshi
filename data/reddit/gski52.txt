I gave my sister $25 worth of BTC for her birthday a few weeks ago. As someone who’s never owned stock or been interested in investing, she was thrilled to see it go up 5% the next day. My hope was just to get her started and show her it’s not scary and spark her interests.

No, she thought it was cool. Holding bitcoin through swings is a learning experience.
 You must be fun to hang around with at parties.

I am attempting to liquidate my Robinhood crypto assets and move to coinbase pro as well, what’s been the best method for you? I’ve just been buying $X amount from Coinbase and then selling the same $X amount from Robinhood, then withdrawing the money back to my bank account or reinvesting it in stocks.

Only 5-10%? You must be middle aged. I’m just now entering the workforce post college so my portfolio will be majority crypto for the time being. I was told to take risks while I’m young ;)
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:32:34
Yeah sure. Just send me $25, I’ll double it ;)

If you’re concerned about a 10 day price difference you shouldn’t be investing in bitcoin let alone on a bitcoin subreddit.

If I had 25 BTC then I wouldn’t have crippling student loan debt :/

Same I’m planning on doing DCA, any idea what weekday is best for setting up automated transfers? I’ve been doing research and reading old articles which all conclude Friday-Monday but I’m not sure yet bc this years market trend is different than last years. I may do my own calculations to find out but I’m lazy.

I had all the same questions as you last month although I am a long term crypto user new turned crypto HODLer. 
1. A few weeks ago when BTC hit its year high Robinhood locked buy orders the following week, for whatever reason. It only lasted a few hours to a day but if they’re capable of enforcing an action like that I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re capable of locking sells. If coinbase locked buy and sells you’d still be able to transfer your coins to an external wallet (which is what most people recommend doing anyways, not your keys nor your coins) and sell them on a site like localbitcoins. I’m not saying Robinhood WILL lock sells at an inconvenient time for you, but the thought and fear of it is enough for me to look elsewhere. I’ll survive having my stocks and crypto in two separate spots.
2. Stocks are insured but crypto isn’t, so who knows it’s a grey are. When I asked the sub this question someone brought up how Lehman Brothers went bankrupt after the 2008 recession, so that would be a good research point to start with. On the other end, I had coin on Cryptopia which suffered a major data breach and hack last year. It was New Zealand based with databases and servers in the US. Currently,to the public’s knowledge who knows what they’re actually doing, they’ve told us they’re liquidating their assets and will use the remaining databases they have in the US to see the value of coin people had in their wallets and reimburse.... I’m guessing they exit scammed tho. This is a prime example of why “not your keys not your coins” is something to live by

For the above reason you listed as your purpose for buying BTC then yes, there is virtually no difference in what exchange or medium you use to buy it. However, there is no guarantee Robinhood will be around forever, nor is there any guarantee you’ll be able to sell your coin when BTC hits a new all time high. Paying the extra $4 transaction fee on coinbase is worth it for the security of having access to your own coin as well as instant withdraw. 
I bought BTC in Robinhood, I no longer want it on there, so I have to sell it back to USD and wait 4 days to transfer it back to my bank account. Where as the coin I bought on coinbase I can sell to USD and instant withdraw to my debit card.
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:26:58
Yep, just throwing it out there. Love the topics though, you’re answering the right questions
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:31:58
I compliment your effort but your grammar and level of English would make it difficult for any noob American to understand. Americans are very suspicious towards foreign/poorly written articles bc of common scams. Also, you think they’ll know $300,000 is denoted as $300.000 in Europe if they don’t even know what bitcoin is?

Are you buying bitcoin to trade and use as a currency? Or are you buying to hold? Sure, I can’t put my investment on a hard wallet and store it in my closet. But I also can’t get my wallet hacked and my funds drained bc I’m using some shit exchange hosted somewhere else but the US. I’m also not planning on using bitcoin as a currency. The exchange rates and transaction times are astronomical compared to other crypto.

Okay, provide me with some evidence of an FDIC insured stock brokerage platform preventing someone from withdrawing their funds without reason....
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:56:31
Robinhood has no fees, it’s instant, and instant deposits with limits of course. The only downside is you can’t move it off the platform.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:11:36
Soooooo they fall apart during the last major recession.. 2008. ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:08:59
Sure, maybe if you like wasting your money on transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:12:00
Has that ever happened? Link me to some evidence, lmao.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:17:48
Because it’s not just a bullshit crypto exchange. It’s a legitimate FDIC insured stock and investment trading platform.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:48:35
When it’s on their system as USD yeah I know they don’t insure crypto. I just find it improbable that something regulated and safe is likely to lose my investment versus a shit-tier foreign crypto exchange. They’re not even in the same league.
