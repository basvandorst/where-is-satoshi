I had the coffee today.  It was good.  People are excited about this for reasons similar to why people used to be excited about internet cafes.

If you are coming to Argentina, check out satoshi tango.  They will exchange bitcoin to pesos and deliver the pesos to you!  I just learned about it today from someone who has used the service.

It would be interesting for someone to calculate how long it would take a sugar crystal-sized block to grow to a sugar cube-sized block under Gavin's proposal.  My quick calculation puts it at about 17 years.
Assumptions: 
sugar cube = 1.25 cm * 1.25 cm * 1.25 cm
sugar crystal = 0.1 cm * 0.1 cm * 0.1 cm
block size increase 1st year = x8
block size increase every two years thereafter = x2

Coffee cake?

They also have a cool touchscreen ordering system for those who prefer to avoid contact with humans.

millibit, millie, also referred to as mbit (pronounced em-bit) or millibit or even bitmill.  -[source1]( -[source2](
Personally, I like mBit most.

Christ, an almond horn would be incredible!  I would pay many mBTC for a good one!

A bit is equivalent to a millionth of a bitcoin and is alternatively known as a micro-bitcoin (μBTC).  The cake and coffee special expressed in μBTC would be 16,600 μBTC which sounds like a lot!

The official bank rate is 9 pesos per dollar, but the street conversion rate is currently 13.3 pesos per dollar.  It's pretty crewed up and is an interesting case study in economic policy (though I won't pretend to have researched it much).
tl;dr - If you are coming to Argentina, bring all the money that you plan to spend in $100 USD bills.  Your trip will be 33% cheaper!

Now that I look at the sign again, it appears to say "Torte de Super Chocolate + Cafe o Te"  So I think the special is chocolate cake plus coffee or tea for 48 pesos, which is about $4, or 0.0166 BTC or 16.6 mBTC.  I like prices for things like this to be quoted in mBTC more than BTC.  To me, expressing the price this way is a lot more intuitive.

I could not get lnd working on my PC, but eclair appears to.  Are there any Android lightning wallets that will allow me to connect to my home eclair node on Windows 10?

Someone mentioned in another thread that not all miners verify blocks.  Is that possible?  If so, is it possible for a doublespend to end up in the blockchain if that particular block was not verified?

I have been traveling through Argentina for the last month and have spoken with several owners of hostels and hotels and most of them have shown interest but want to know details.  Many Argentinians seem to understand the idea of an alternate currency very quickly and easily as they have seen how the value of their own currency has changed against the USDollar over time.  The Argentinian Peso and the USDollar are converted at banks and (for a better rate) on the street.  It is very easy and common to convert between the two currencies.
The biggest hangup most people have articulated so far is the perceived and actual difficulty in converting BTC into Pesos.  People need Pesos to pay for expenses.  It's nice to buy coffee with bitcoin at BitCoffee, but unless you can also buy plumbing parts at BitPlumbing, BTC isn't the most desirable currency.  Converting BTC to Pesos seems to be relatively easy in big cities like Buenos Aires.  One exchange that was mentioned in Satoshi Tango.  I've been told that they will deliver Pesos in exchange for BTC, although I have also been told that they need to collect identification information and I have no idea if foreigners would be able to access the service.

Some of the businesses either weren't there or weren't open (sometimes its hard to tell here).  The sample size has been too small to make any generalizations about what % of businesses are legit.    However, I've been to three cafes that accept bitcoin and paid with BTC each time.  I've also sold bitcoin to other people for pesos in two of the three cafes.  In fact, I'm writing this from Lab Cafe in Palermo where I paid for my (excellent) coffee and my wife's (equally excellent) latte with BTC.
Based on the transactions that I've had so far, I'd say that the experience needs to be improved.  In 2 of 3 cases, the qr code I was given was just an address, not a request for a specific amount of BTC, leaving me to quickly calculate how much should be paid.  This is really a pain when you are dealing with three currencies: dollars, pesos and BTC.

My experiences so far don't support that speculation.

I applaud your initiative, but I don't think your 30 pis will help your cause much.  On the other hand, you could use them to make your own testnet to study its properties and do other fun stuff.  They also make nice media players.
