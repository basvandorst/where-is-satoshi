This is really disastrous, since the volume on localbitcoins has been a good indicator of OTC demand on the open market, independent of speculators on the exchanges trading coins among each other.
Note, demand on localethereum remains flat meaning aside from speculation volume on exchanges, the demand remains low.

Haha... Sure for those that aren't degen traders, high short seller interest often means they eventually need to BUY in order to close their position.  Short sellers covering often cascade as the price pumps upward.   High short interest is a future promise to buy.
Bitfinex has a "claim" button that allows a short seller to cover buy their position if their bitcoin is backed 1:1.  This claim will be off the books.  So, it looks like 1 person claimed 20k of Bitcoin.
TLDR: We no longer have a huge promise to buy at a future date thus less upward pressure.
