Humam mouse movements are all but random, I'd advise anyone against using this.

Why can't your signature be See ID?
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:09:10
Not bad, not bad at all :)

If needed, I am going to cooperate with the bitcoinj developers.
p.s.: It is bitcoinj, therefore it is lightweight.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:32:05
You probably mean my grandma... :P

It is the "house edge". If it weren't, the money would be returned to the reward bag.
@_date: 2014-08-31 10:06:15
ignorance is bliss.
@_date: 2014-09-19 04:51:58
It's not about the terrible bet -- it's about luring people in by offering unbelievably good odds. Intentional from the beginning.

Camera holder needs some schnapps.
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:09:20
Nice try, vanitygen.
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:32:12
Which somehow prevents you from subtracting below zero.
It doesn't throw exception. It just wraps around. Imagine a catastrophy then. :) :)

No. Living off bitcoin means you are using your bitcoin reserves to live. "A musician is living off his donations."
Living away from bitcoin is a strange formulation, although it would probaby mean you are moving to avoid using bitcoin.

Bad proposal, since the micro symbol cannot be easily typed on the keyboard.
@_date: 2014-04-23 07:04:46
Argument, maybe?
@_date: 2014-09-19 03:59:26
Well, he didn't even have to put real bitcoins, as far as I'm concerned. He could've just eliminated his previous bid.
@_date: 2014-04-23 07:03:01
I haven't responded because I was asleep.
Icons are from a set, I didn't have time to make my own. Therefore, they are not the best. I disagree on them being small.
I disagree avatars are pointless. If there is an easy way to insert them (like drag and drop a file, move to reposition), then they are effortless to the user.
Typography is easily changed, but currently, I like it. Address book boxes do look a little cluttered, I'll see what I can do regarding that.
I think you focused on the wrong thing. This appllication is more about healthy abstraction of a bitcoin protocol and logical application flow.
2. What do you think of Hive? Are you ctitical of them, too?
3. What do you think of this: 
@_date: 2014-04-23 07:29:58
Hive is a bitcoin wallet for Mac. 
The spacing is too liberal and the typography is bad.
I see you are not sharing my vision.
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:41:46
OP is full of shit, that's the reason.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:30:40
The problem is, we cannot know where other bugs are lurking. Bitcoin is no joke. If you cannot get such basic thing right, we can be almost certain you failed miserably at many other things too.
Please look at Mt.Gox, please look at bitcoin-24 who were storing user balances using floating-point numbers, please look at numerous other cases of bad engineering.
I discourage anyone from using your service. And I am not kidding at the slightest.
@_date: 2014-04-23 10:41:06
GPL3 probably. It has to be compatible with the bitcoinj.
@_date: 2014-05-04 07:13:44
You mean 5.44 years?
@_date: 2014-09-19 03:57:34
That is not an arguement for such high house edge! You could easily have it benefit the betters.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:27:20
So please, tell me a programming language that has a special type for positive numbers.
p.s.: I mean a real positive type, that would enforce the constraint with an exception.
Do you know what C does if you subtract 11 from unsigned int i = 10?
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:48:35
seeding and using a PRNG is not increasing the entropy. It is still bad.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:36:47
No, just Bitcoin for now.
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:08:41
Boom in the opposite direction!
@_date: 2014-04-23 06:47:40
You have probably overlooked the (switch wallet) button in the top left corner! :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:36:05
Thank you!

Point of the graph:
Invest! You can gain 1000000%, but you can only lose 100%.
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:35:46
You have to have both.
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:13:17
Look. Type checking is compile-time, static feature. Meanwhile exceptions are run-time features. There are some errors you can catch while you are programming (here strong typing helps a little), meanwhile for the others you need program to be ran in some special way to occur.
You cannot detect whether natural number is going to be subtracted below its bound (0) at compile time, you need exceptions.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:28:31
Sure. But we are talking about a language that would prevent such errors, even if programmer forgot to check that, like OP did.
If there existed a language that would prevent you from subtracting below zero on Nat datatype, then you'd get a 500 Internal Server Error (common behaviour on uncaught exception), not negative balance.

No. No good bignum library uses string representation internally. It's just too slow.
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:27:22
That wasn't a hat, it was a piece of thin cloth.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:36:26
Multisig is crucial. However, more problematic than design is the UX, i.e. how to present the interface in a most logical and understandable way for an average Joe.
It is one of the priorities.
