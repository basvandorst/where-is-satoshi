I was just looking about it. :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:41:49
How did you figure that redirect? I could not tell :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:07:57
This is terrible :/
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:24:15
Thank you all for your comments, even those that got mad, yelled and cursed at me. I am looking at you,  and  xD.
The day this happened I was having a really bad day and is why everything took a turn over worse because of my bad decisions. 
I am trying to change or improve, you could say. So I started by fully securing my account now, with a randomly generated password, 2FA with Authy, and mobile link enabled (plus ublock origin, of course). And now I'll just use my phone to log in and check my account. I am also trying to get a hardware wallet, but, as I mentioned to another Reddit fellow, It's not easy getting one here. If I can get a friend or family to get me one in the US, that would be the only way. I'd need to research how to use them as well. No idea, but I am willing to learn.
Also, I want to send my huge thanks to all of you who asked me rather insistently and wished to donate a little bit as a thank you for sharing my stupidity with the world, lol. Thanks to you, I have recovered what I lost and a little bit more. So, I guess, I am not out of the crypto world just yet, and as a few of you told me, I need to pick myself up, learn and move forward. It should be easy for someone like me who has suffered more bone fractures in his life than wardrobe changes, lol, but sometimes it is not. Once again, thanks to you, for helping me remember not to give up. 
I'm sharing a pic of myself as a way to show you who it is behind the screen. (ladies, be careful, I can be scary xD).

Sadly I got this advice a bit late. I do have it now, though. I had Adblock for Firefox :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:30:49
Well, I think this was the end of my cripto adventures, to be honest. lol
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:21:15
You might want to know that I have doubled the securities to my wallet. If I recover I might not stay away from cryptocurriences after all, haha. I am learning a hard lesson though. 2FA on, Mobile Linked, and all the shenanigans turned on. lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:46:38
I set up Google Auth. How do I setup Authy?, it didn't give me an option to pick that up. Only Google Auth and Yubikey. Is Yubikey the one? I do have Authy on my phone :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:06:31
Yeah, I think that's another reason why I did not "see" it. I was programmed in the back of my head thinking there were no ads. :/
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:34:53
You are absolutely right. I was mentally tired. I had just ended watching consecutive videos of a marketing course, which was super boring and kinda difficult to grasp, but that I needed to go through. My main mistake was not taking a timeout before going through my sensitive tasks. :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:48:22
Yeah, I was dumb. :/
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:09:18
I am so sorry :( ... This is really terrible. Too many crooks online and there is little that can be done justice wise.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:50:16
I have no knowledge of such things. I guess I'll research more in my free time :). This should not be too hard to use if they expect cryptos to be the future :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:29:38
Yeah, so true. I did have an ad blocker installed in Firefox. Strange that the ad would still show up :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:08:20
Thank you, but I think this was the end of my cripto adventures, heh. :P
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:51:01
Yes, I was using Adblock for Firefox :/. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:50:18
Sadly, I think this was indeed the end of my cripto adventures. :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:49:14
What do you mean, "Again?" 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:41:02
I was thinking about that, but since I am in Ecuador, not sure I could sue Google over here. I do feel they are in part responsible for accepting ad revenues from scamming sites. :(
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:02:33
Perfect. I'm definitely getting one. My aunt is cool and she doesn't know about these things, she is 75 :p. 
I moved away from blockchain to Jaxx (with mobile access only and seed backup), for the time being. Thanks for your advice and everything. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:12:59
You are too kind, friend. But, as I said to one person who wrote me via PM, I think I'd feel bad if you give me money. I even deleted my wallet id from the images just in case people were thinking the same as you :). I appreciate the thought though :). Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:45:21
Yep. Using authy with it, lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:47:54
Unfortunately, I'm not too knowledgable on these things. Also, I live in a country where we can't just buy a hardware wallet, it's not that easy :(
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:56:26
People told me the same about Google Authenticator :O... what is the truth? :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:06:58
I did that. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:00:36
I cannot use Linux as a main driver on my computer. And I am not too versed on Linux to be able to handle it for everyday tasks. I tried a while ago, but I could not even get used to Open Office, lol, and updating the OS was always a pain (plus my video drivers never worked too well). :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:46:41
Yep, but the link I clicked was the ad which redirected to another site, not blockchain.com. Someone here at reddit noticed it for me. That's how I got dupped :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:56:11
Which one do you recommend and where should I get one?
If I have a friend in the US I could ask him to buy it for me.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:29:59
Amen to that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:32:15
Oh dear lord, I think I would have killed myself if I was you. :O. I can't handle this kind of situations too well. I am sorry it happened to you too.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:55:02
Really, didn't have to. I thank you very much. :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:01:29
I did install ublock origin as for others' suggestion. :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:36:21
I'll switch to Google Authenticator then. Thanks a lot for the information!.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:07:25
Thanks so much. I just did that myself as well :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:48:37
I am sorry :( ... It really is terrible :(.
I received it. Much appreciated :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:19:25
What about the Nano S? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:47:17
Incredible!. Thanks for the tip, I will do that right now.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:54:07
Nevermind, I figured it out. I have Authy enabled now :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:10:51
Is this one  ?
I have an aunt there who will return in 5 months. She could get it for me :)
