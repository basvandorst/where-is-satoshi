It does to them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:43:16
Looks like they decided to do it early.  You had to have the coins on Coinbase on Aug 1.  If you did and you didn't receive them, you should reach out to Coinbase's support. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:43:33
But what have you done for me TODAY!?  :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:28:05
When will it be here?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:44:42
Oh, that makes perfect sense.  Thanks!

So I'm still trying to understanding tether.  If I actually get USDT instead of USD, then I 'cash out' by withdrawing my money, I still get USD, right?  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:49
It's true and correct.  When the fork happened on Aug 1 everyone who held BTC on that date got an equal number of BCH, because the chain literally split into two separate parts with the same transaction history up to that point.
Wherever you had your BTC at that moment is where the BCH existed.  It's just that Coinbase never supported BCH until now, so your BCH has been just sitting there all this time.
Now you do with it whatever you want.  Sell it for that surprise money, hodl it in the hopes it gains value, send it elsewhere, whatever you want.

Oh my god, I feel stupid.  You just made a lightbulb go off in my head.  I use a ledger nano s, which supports segwit.  I send to/from an exchange that also supports it.  I've never understood why I don't seem to have the same issue as others.  Duh, because I'm using segwit.  God I feel so silly right now...

Yeah, I had a friend's dad, who was a preacher, ask me in the early 90's if I thought computers and the internet were the beast or something related to it.
I told him I have no idea.  In retrospect, I really wish I would have said yes just to freak him out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:40:16
So noob question here.  I understand holding during dips, and if anything buying more.  But what do people mean when they say a 'strong hand'.  Do they mean a lot of money in it, or do they just mean someone who's patient and doesn't make emotional decisions?  Just curious about the terminology.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:46:39
Do you feel that boy? The way the shit clings to the air. Shit blizzards coming
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:31:41
How does larger blocks mean a move toward centralization?  I hear people say that, but I'm ignorant of the reasoning behind it.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:45:11
Personally I think you're giving bitcoin cash WAY more credit than they deserve in all this.  They're little fish, they couldn't have this much of an impact on the entire market.  IMO.. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:32:03
I love bizzlebits!
It's like bitcoins that you've bedazzled.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:08:50
Gold also has real-world use, which helps facilitate its value.  It can be used in electronics, etc.  Bitcoin currently has no practical real-world use, because other coins do its job better (not to mention, on a grand scale virtually no one accepts it still).  
That ain't stopping me from buying it tho!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:48:42
Yeah, I want them BOTH to succeed.  I want every damn coin on the market to succeed. Money for everyone! wooooo
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:47:19
This is a very key point.  Obviously those of us into crypto want these things but the mainstream consumer could give a rat's ass.  If it's not super-fast, they don't care about how awesome it might be otherwise.  If they're going to have to wait, they don't want it.  I'd prefer BOTH decentralization vs fast times, not one or the other. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:12:26
Panic selling.  When something starts crashing in price, many people panic thinking "THIS IS ZE END!" and sell to "cut their losses".  They think it's better to get something out of it than nothing if it goes to 0.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:32:14
I'm having a hard time understanding your point.  If they hold both coins from a fork, which means holding btc, then aren't they still keeping their value in btc AND the new coin?
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:51:53
Same here.  I tell them I believe that bitcoin is myspace - a trailblazer and the icon of the future.  But there's still a facebook coming.. I just don't know which one it is, yet.

I DECLARE a FORK
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:14:19
Don't feel like you've missed out, you definitely haven't.  View it as investing x-amount of money into bitcoins, as opposed to buy x-number of bitcoins.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:28:05
Oh.  My.  God.  I never really "got it" that pwned might have originated as a typo.  I assumed it was intentionally misspelled.  Then I noticed p and o are next to each other... man do I feel silly.

What dump?  Not being difficult, just honestly don't know.  I mean, I know what happened this weekend with prices on both sides in terms of where they went, but was there some massive dump of some kind?

What is RBF?
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:09:30
Good follow-up man
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:23:55
Right.  If you just hodl and the prices rises and falls, etc. but you just hodl, you don't pay taxes.  Only when you sell it for USD (or from what I'm reading in this thread, other crypto).

New to Bitcoins, trying to learn.  I assume this rig is for mining?  What OS do you install on it?
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:13:02
This guy eats!
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:07:32
No it's an application that has multi-platform support:  iPhone, Android, Windows, etc.  You'll still want a hardware wallet such as trezor or ledger.
A good way to operate is to store the bulk of your bitcoin on the hardware wallet, as in what you plan to HODL.  Then just keep your "walking around" money, i.e. the coin you'll use to buy and sell goods, on something like Jaxx.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:15:28
I totally admit I don't really get Segwit and Segwit2X.  I'm in the process of reading up on them to learn more, and one of the things I've read talks about Segwit addresses and companies changing to them, such as this article:  
So when they talk about addresses, what does that mean?  I bought bitcoin a while back and am hodl'ing for the long term.  Do I need to send them to a new bitcoin address for myself to be a part of it, or will my bitcoin address be 'good'?  What I'm trying to avoid is a scenario where I've stored my bitcoin on my hardware wallet offline for years and years and then finally when I go to get it, the address is no longer valid because of changes in the intervening years.

I just had a conversation with a work buddy about this exactly.  I would love to see cryptocurrency (specifically bitcoin) take off to the moon, but with it so easy to lose your money, and all the infighting and forks within the community, bitcoin will NEVER be the world-dominating currency the community wants it to be.
I.e. Bitcoin needs to get its shit together if it wants to be top dog.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:12:57
Yeah, this here.  Forget about the past, it's done you can't change it.  Just look forward.

I'm new to the scene so don't know their history, is this common with them?
