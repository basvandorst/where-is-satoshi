What you do is you pick a number. How many Bitcoin do you want to own? Then when the price dips like it does you feel real comfortable adding to your position.

Take out a loan from your bank. Then do not pay them back.
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:45:14
Look it up the nice spike in Bitcoin price everybody decided to pick some up.
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:50:21
Be careful being a Bitcoin hodl ER is addictive. You will find yourself working extra hours and maybe even having a second job just so you can stack satoshi's.
@_date: 2019-08-18 07:50:37
I think I heard somewhere that Facebook coin is on the blockchain. That's pretty good right? Should I buy some? Hell I'll post my private keys on the internet.

@_date: 2019-08-17 11:12:48
I sold a shitload of basic attention token and loaded up on BTC at that price.
@_date: 2019-10-18 02:01:26

Take out a loan from your bank. Then forget to pay them back.
@_date: 2019-08-18 07:48:25
There's another one I think they call it Tron? Has some solid dude behind Justin Sun? Heard his buddies with Warren Buffett.
@_date: 2019-08-17 10:46:32
When you purchase off of coinbase they charge you $3 fee up to $200 in purchase they also upcharge the coin roughly $40. But yeah it does look like you paid a pretty good premium.

Have you ever tried to sell silver? It is an absolute pain in the ass. Not to mention they screw you like a farmyard chicken.
@_date: 2019-12-30 23:06:18
Actually I had my roommate throw a battery in my Celica GTS. Not the same mileage. But I've actually said a prayer for the last five days thank the Lord that I'm alive. Keep stacking SATs boys.

What is too much? People pay what they're willing to pay for a quality product. In Mize Bitcoin is a quality product.
@_date: 2019-12-30 23:29:19
That's the question I'm asking. I got three options to buy a new car. Write a check. Sell the Bitcoin. Or sell the silver. But either way nobody's getting a nickel from me on a finance charge. Unless somebody knows something I do not know I could dump a little corn tonight. Pay the coinbase fees and have it in my account in the morning.
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:01:15
Just don't start posting pictures of random cats.

I hope it isn't Peter Schiff.
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:47:37
BULLSHIT add every picture of every  BITCOIN ATM machine you can come across and give us the exact location.
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:03:34
I've had friends recently send me pictures of ATMs in airports in Miami Baltimore malls in Tennessee. Pretty interesting to me. I would never tell them don't send me that picture. Hell I even had one of a guy swinging a sign Bitcoin accepted here in the middle of Florida. That excited me.
@_date: 2019-12-10 12:58:20
Bittrex wants a sample of your sperm,..... shit and blood........ so you toss your underwear up on the desk and walk out like a BOSS.
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:58:48
Can any Bitcoin ATM owner let us know what the insurance is per month on said machine?
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:50:29
Click my dick.

Here's a conundrum its 6:34 p.m. and do you think you're going to find a silver buyer in the world that will buy silver now for cash?
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:04:37
Not if you hold currency in Ghana.
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:45:48
Maybe you should check out Bitcoin Satoshi vision. Now that my friends was a joke. Not Financial advice obviously.

And since this was the last post Jesus Christ I need to go get myself a drink.
@_date: 2019-12-30 23:35:14
Here's the scary thing. Have you ever crawled in and out of a Toyota Celica GTS more than once a day? It is freaking brutal. Now let your friend hit you in the gut with a hammer about six times and then try and do it within a week or two it ain't happening.
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:47:20
Because it's the internet.
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:52:29
In case things were not perfectly clear. They certainly are now.
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:55:34
Tell that to the family in Argentina.
@_date: 2019-12-30 23:26:58
Yeah but that's my hedge. It is kind of funny I'm still laughing about it.
@_date: 2019-12-30 23:25:43
The insurance company is working quick. They looked at the car today determined it totaled and we're ready to pick it up tonight. I missed the message. But they're ready to take the car and cut me a check. I don't know what the value is 2013 Prius probably nine grand.
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:00:20
Ain't nobody got no time for that.
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:03:53

About 3 bucks on a hundy before the 20-25 bux upcharge on BTC
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:16:36
Not even 2 hard forks could do that.......BUT I will take my 2 shitcoins for a %20 gain to hold garbage for 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:00:58
We did that then Russia rolled in and took Berlin,
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:49:20
But they are trading and using it for purchases.I shall hold mine. When 17 million coins are in cold storage I will use mine.
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:39:11
What?.....6 months ago? Now you put on the leotards and buy that shit and check back in 6 months....SOLDIER. Did I tell you the story of Justin stranded in a canyon with 2 sheep and a goat ?

If you are buying Bitcoin NEVER invest more than you choose to double in the neat 7 months.(remember the last 3 years) Hope this helps.

Is xrp going to $1,000? LMFAO.
@_date: 2019-09-08 10:20:12
Fees were paid in Fiat. We now have Bitcoin. So no fees were not high.
@_date: 2019-09-08 10:38:05
Remember friends don't let friends buy xrp. The Ripple shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:54:54
Let's all keep our fingers crossed.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:37:05
Would anybody ever convert their Bitcoin into Fiat? That would seem counterproductive.
@_date: 2019-09-13 10:17:45
What smart people do as they spend Bitcoin they replace it immediately.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:26:07

Yeah it's probably those jack-offs on the Kitco board.
@_date: 2019-09-13 05:49:36
Stop it with the nonsense. This kid is trying to make an influence on the world. Pump those shitcoins elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:53:37
Well I was going to send a billion dollars worth of BTC to the  Bakkt Exchange but I didn't want to spend the $699 on transaction fee. But what makes me really laugh is the xrp bag holders like to  comment  how " expensive" the TX fee was.
@_date: 2019-09-07 09:01:47
I think they're getting ready to load up on xrp. And yes that is a joke.
@_date: 2019-09-07 09:12:51
I have cashed out my 401k three separate times.
@_date: 2019-09-13 10:15:35
You are correct. And Bitcoin never will be a corporation.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:28:23
Oh oh looks somebody sold all of their XRP
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:56:55
