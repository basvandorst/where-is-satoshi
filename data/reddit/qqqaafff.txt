Its just like currency around today.  1 Canadian dollar can buy a can of pop, it takes many more Japanese yen to buy a can of pop.  Likewise it takes much fewer bitcoins to buy a can of pop.  One day it might take 0.000001 bitcoins to buy a pop.  The trick is to realize you cant compare one kind of dollar directly to another kind of dollar in terms of value.  At least thats my opinion.
In other words today people buy bitcoins 1 or 10 at a time.  In the future maybe we will buy them 0.001 to 0.01 at a time.  Or maybe 10 to 100 at a time if their value goes down.
I imagine once bitcoins hits its limit more people will still want them, but no one will pay more for them then they can get for their own currency, so it will kind of self regulate.  Kind of hard to say, a part of me still thinks one day the price will crash, but another part think it will just keep going up

Im an electrical engineer, who electronics seem to hate.  I don't buy printers anymore because i burn through them, even though I hardly ever print anything.  And external hard drives also seem to hate me.  I find it funny how we can send a man to the moon on decades old technology but cant build a reasonably reliably thing like a power supply (or printer)

Also trying to figure out best way to get bitcoins in Canada.  So far the option i like best is mailing a check to mtgox.  They charge 2% of the amount.  But then the question is how do i get the money out of mtgox if i want to.
