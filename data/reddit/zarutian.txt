Hmm.. have you heard about the concept cost-unit (not sure it actually called that in English)?
It is basically this: To perform some physical or computation work you must expend x amount of resources to do so. That amount is measured in cost-units, those could be MegaWatt/Hours for electricity, Joules, tonns of quartz and so on.
There is a theoritical minimum of such required for any given work.
Here is the kicker, regardless of how much you 'print' of fiat monetary currency units you only increase the ratio between those and cost-units.
So, let them try to 'quantively ease' themself out of it.

I actually have seen the inside the IT infrastructure of one bank. And to be frank about it the 'cybersecurity' inside it was quite horrible.
Regarding the 'sum of 100 Millons €' "point" of yours. You are only thinking of retail level customers and yes people that have transfered that amount of money do not wait a few days where the whereabouts of that money is in question during the transfer. Business owners buying raw materials or equipment for instance.


It is only done for you, maybe. The shop itself has not gotten paid yet but then again you dont mind paying the extra cost of the others that reverse the charge fraudently or absentmindedly.


It is nothing __for you__.  A lot of people around the world are not that lucky or wealthy.


Lets say your account was frozen due to fat fingered typo when the local tax authority ordered the bank to freeze the assets of an guy that just happens to share your last name and first initial. It could take days if not months for you to clean up. And you probably be mostly on your own. 
And I do not keep all my savings in Bitcoin, an bank, in stocks or gold coinage. Doing so is idiotic.
The sum I keep in Bitcoin is in a cold wallet hand-punch-chiseled into a plat made of high temperture and corrosive resistant alloy.


Probably eventually but where will you be in the meantime?

Also, there are mining farms sitting next to renewable but fluctuating energy sources such as wind farms. They are often the 'electricty buyer of last resort'. This means when there is quite the surplus of electricty (the wind is blowing hard and it is quite more than demand) the power company gets paid when it used to be that they didnt.
This spurns investment and innovation into more renewable energy.

Clearly you have not seen the inside the IT infrastructure of many banks.


It is actually a higher chance that a bank gets deliberatly hacked than you think.


When does your weekend start? Friday? Saturday? Sunday? not all places uses the same bank holiday calender and you also think that businesses are only in one country.


Nope, the payment is not done in those five seconds. Only a check if your account does have the funds and reservement thereof. The actual payment is not done until the transaction is fully settled and that can take up to 90-180 days.
About ten minutes or so for a first confirmation of an Bitcoin transaction is way less than 90 days. If you are in a hurry then lightning network cuts down the wait time down to about a second or two.


Which is 120€ per annum. I suspect from your description on how chaviliar you handle your finances, that the interest of the money behind the balance of your account earns the bank more than that per annum.
So, from just those comments I hold forth that your knowledge of the ways of the world is equiv to a fifteen year old kid.

Why does this myth persist? (the usual IANAL applies here)
Legal tender only means that a debtor can attempt to discharge a debt with payment made in it, even if the contract between debtor and lender clearly states that payment must be made with spefic other method of payment. If lender refuses the payment then the lender is barred from using that countrys legal system to collect on that debt.
However measures such as the lender publicly stating that he/she/it/whatever wont do futher business with debtor until debtor does fullfill the contractual obligation of the aforesaid lending contract is probably well within the legality of most countries.

If it isnt collected then the possibility of misuse goes away.
One thing I have never gotten is why each bank and financial institution needs its own compliance department instead of this being handled by a governmental institution as it is pretty much policeing.


Which they probably arent as Icelandic Persónuverndarlög state that an company handling financial information of an Icelandic citizen or resident must undergo compliance auditing where leakage of such information to any other party not spefically authorized in that law (or referenced law) must be prevented.
And that I think conflicts with USA KYC/AML laws or regulations

Which is very very unlikely without leakage of their plans or tip off to miners.


I am going to assume here that you mean the stratum or equiv mining pool coordination servers.
Hmm.. plausable up until when people who connect their miners to these mining pools detect, or hear about, that they are actually just mining on the gov fork of the coin and drop off from those servers. They then get Tor or I2P and connect to mining pool stratum servers that are only reacable via .onion address.
Archiving and verifying full nodes would also disconnect from those gov fork nodes.


Hmm.. That "offical" BTC will then promply craterize itself in price as people sell it for Dash or preferably Monero, and Zcash.
Also the miners can retaliate against that gov fork of bitcoin by mining only empty blocks on it until difficulty has arisen high enough for their liking and then dropping off, rendering that fork unusable.


How can they be sure that they have control over all the miners? Even one hash a minute cpu miner that doesnt follow the new gov consensus rules could get lucky.
So, you have to think about all the ramifications and incentives of the individuals that are taking part in this highly theoritical scheme of yours.

For instance a pizza place could increase the power efficiency of their electric baking ovens a bit, use that power 'surplus' to run an efficient miner and duct the hot air from it with the other hot air from the ovens out normally.
Plus, Bitcoind supports connecting only over Tor without that much of config.
Add to that, many places with 'free wifi' have started to VPN over Tor that traffic.
Something that the above mentioned pizza place could do.
This, all above took about a minute to think up. I am sure there are more devious and sly ways to do this kind of thing.
(VPN over Tor is not so much used for security but mainly to do support other protocols than only TCP. Plus VPN providers servers do not see nearly as much hassle as Tor exit nodes.)

Rough sketched scenario, still working out the details but I hope I get it across what I am thinking here:
Lets say the chattle in question is a new car with a conditional maintenance contract on it. One condition might be that the possesor can only get it serviced at spefic franchises, at some specified discount, until the car is ten years old . This contract might be so that the original buyer can buy it a bit cheaper, the manifacturer can ensure that they get engineering performance data back and so forth. The Engine Management Unit or an auxilary processor of it is then programmed to turn on "Service Needed" indicator in the dashboard every 10000 kilometers or so. After that turns on the possesor has two weeks of engine running time to get it serviced or the car just wont start. The owner is also required when selling the car to inform the buyer of this chattle contract and report the change of ownership to the franchises.
Now, a drug warrior (a cop), gets a bee in his bonet that the current owner is transporting a 'product' (whatever the drug warrior can come up with), pulls him over and gets the car impounded. Later a 'Civil Asset Forfeture' proceedings is initiated so the drug warriors can have a ball or whatever for the proceeds of the auction of the car. Because it is waste of resources to try to 'proove' that the car is not illgotten gains in such proceedings the owner does not do so.
Come auction time some poor guy pays the price and drives off in the car. Now, some time later aforesaid "Service Needed" indicator turns on but the guy ignores it thinking it is just some idiot light. Right until when the car does not start. The guy happens then to call one of the franchieses to get the car towed and repaired. IThe car gets towed to a repair shop. The franchise mechanics sees in their records that no report of change of ownership has been entered and contact the original owner. He says that his car was taken without his consent nor permission and he wants it back. The guy who paid for the car of the auction is told that the car has been repossesed due to contract violation. The guy could sue but the franchise tells him that it would then ensure that he would then pay more in lawyer fees than the car is worth.
How quickly do you think people will stop buying 'civil asset forfeitted' things from drug warrior when they might loose said thing?
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:01:52


How much was spent on gathering that package doesnt say anything about the veracity of the 'evidence' provided in it.


Which is up to debate because that organization has a stake in the outcome of the trial.


If they are lazy then they wont verify the 'evidence' and just pass it on to the courts directly.


By investigating and following up on the 'evidence' provided and not blindly beleave it. It is harder and takes more work but it prevents stuff like perjury in one case where IRC logs had been tampered with.


Which can be extremely costly for a defendent that actually had nothing to do with the case other than paying the ISP bill.

Even though BSA and third money laundering directive supersedes any contract law it doesnt supersede contractual obligation. Specially with contracts that trigger forsenic audits by a third party auditor when the contractee fails to deliver even if that failure is due to AML.
Best AML/KYC policy/program I have seen is just report every and all transactions and state so publicly.

One thing that governmental fiat currencies do not have is long term planning stability. On timescale of decades what a government decides regarding its currency seems to change on a whim and flipflops.
Any real world enterprise (used in the sense of endevour and not corporation) that is planned to take or exists in decades does not use 'economic theory' for planning but what underlies such namely utility and logicistics.

I had a credit card once. The kind you had to top up before hand. Used it a few times to buy stuff on the net.
The process went like this:
1. I see something I want to buy,
2. put it into the shoppingcart,
3. repeated a few times,
4. totalled the prices together,
5. top the exact amount onto the credit card,
6. check out on the shopping site giving them the credit card number,
7. wait for the purchases to be delivered.
Never had to argue against an unauthorized charge on it as the credit card was left empty most of the time. So, no sudden extra hassle.

The USD is slowly inflating towards Zimbabwe levels.
It would probably end, for normal people, in the same way that many oil buying/selling companies around the world do it:
1. agree on price per liter in the local currency.
2. The buyer rapidly exchanges the local currency into USD and pays the seller with USD
3. The seller hands over the agreed amount of oil (or the deeds/securities/etc of it) to the buyer
4. The seller then rapidly exchanges the USD back into local currency.
Most often the exchange between USD and local currency happens nearly directly between the buyer and the seller. (There is indirection through an currency exchange.) This happens so that oil seems to be sold for USD when in reality it hasnt.
For normal people they would probably neicogate (spelling?) to paid in the equaliance of amount of gold or such and get USD. Then exchange the USD into bitcoin or whatever that doesnt loose value rapidly (both of which are subjective to them). When they need to pay taxes or what ever that only accepts USD then they exchange back, pay the tax/etc.

The usually recommended method for small and medium sized merchants to handle chargebacks is basicly setting aside the revenue of each transaction made with an credit card and wait the whole 90 days before touching it.

You can exterminate an corporation without killing anyone. Just destroy their assets. If an corpotation is enough pain in the arse and is causing you and others enough loss then chipping in to remove that player from the board is worth it.


Their own due dilligence and nothing else. There is no one to nanny them and there should not be anyone to nanny them.


With the assaination prediction markets (APMs) would make issuing "executive orders" a chancy and risky business for the issuer. Why? Because if the issuer of aforsaid order tick enough people off to prompt them to put their money where their mouth is then the probability of something happening to the issuer rises rather dramatically.


And you clearly do not understand that I am pointing out the obvious: if you attack people then dont be surprised that they will lash back.
APMs might be one of the drastic backlashes.

It can be eather or both. How do you trust this process more than the credit card companies? In the case of a computer process running on your own machine, you can be sure it does it is supposed to. (That is, if your OS has proper access control systems in place. Not like most *NIX deveritives or look-a-likes today.) In the case of a third party you can trust it as much as you trust an online wallet service.
What if the amount varies? Well, you can set an upper limit per payment and if it goes over the process should notify you promptly.
What I gather from your post is that there are servral services bundled under the CC hat.
Micro- or shortterm loans (paying heating bill in installments), escrow service (if a merchant you ordered something from doesnt deliver)
What I and many others have often been trying to point out that, most times you do not want that extra bundling as it costs extra for everyone.

An real escrow checks the merchandise themselfs before releasing the funds to the seller. If they find out that the ware is not as advertised they return it to the seller as it were and return the funds to the buyer.
Relieing on eather the seller or buyer to thruthfully say anything about the
condition of the merchandise is abmissably bad.

Escrow has and always will cost much. Anyone who is trying to sell you "escrow" for no to little cost is scamming you.

Regarding AML/KYC rules and having to give copies of ID documents and answering questionaries.
One time when I wanted to open an account at a local bank where I live I got quite a few suspictious questions in the "AML/KYC mandated" questionary. Some of the questions were rather invasive for no clear reason.
I promptly declined filling the rest of it and walked out with the questionary.
After contacting the local equiv of finsec it turned out that most of the questionary had nothing to do with AML/KYC and was pure marketing research. Something that is quite against Private Personal Information Privacy laws. Something on the line of an entity is only allowed to collect and process such information for upfront clearly stated purpose and no other.
This resulted in a huge fine for the bank involved (something around 5% or so of its last years brutto income) and auditing of its use of PII that was only meant for KYC/AML and that other PII was not collected via the same questionay.
So beware and do your due dilligance unless you want to be duped.
Btw, I have heard that there is talk of make it possible that people use the finsec authoritys public keys to encrypt such information to prevent the financial business from gleaning information that they should not have access to for other purposes.

Which would be rather meaningless unless they have been convicted of white collar crime. (Convictions which are fucking rare nowdays.)


The former violates various privacy and data security laws around the world. (Remember Bitcoin is international not just local).
The latter also violates various privacy and non-disclosure laws around the world while doing very little from preventing financing of criminal organization and majorly inconviencing/costing everyone else. (Ditto)


Something that ALL serious IT and financial firms everywhere must fullfill but sadly seldom do. (Seen it with my own eyes at a bank that I was working at through subcontracting. Anctidotal, yes but par of the course in that sector)

Surely you do not accept currency for it if said storage company spoils that sugar due to incompetence or whatever. You want 250 kilos of granular sugar of same quality plus some compensation for opertunity cost wasted, no?
The reason why you bought so much could be that you need that sugar in making some sort of baked goods or what have you and you want to hedge against supply line delays and spot price fluctuations. The storage company should not care about or even know about your reasons, the only thing is that they must fully bear any damage they cause their customers and not their customers.

In a few of the cases they lent, without collateral or security, to drawer-firms to buy stock in their own banks to keep the stock price up.
First, that violates the terms of pretty many stock exchange access contracts. (That is contracts between the exchange, the buyers and the sellers on how to conduct business on the exchange. Basically like an TOS but with more legal weight so to speak.)
Second, that violated the terms of contracts that the bank has/had with customers and owners on its reliablity and financial liability.
Third, it violated terms of the banking charter they were granted. (So the balances below certain maximum were insured by the Icelandic state. So basically an insurance)

The book on dual stack machines seems to be Stack Machines the New Wave by Philp Koopman. I also recommend Starting Forth, Thinking Forth and various other books found at Forth Intrest Group website forth.org .
If you want to understand a Forth system completely I recommand looking into eForth. Specially in porting it to some other arch that x86 (I personally ported it to DCPU-16)
Personally I think you could achive a lot with programs written in non Turing Complete languages/bytecode so long as those languages/bytecodes are at least on the level of primitive recursive functions.

I offer profuse appologizes for my idiosyncratic English as I am no native speaker of it. (Learning it as a third language makes it so that one often is more familiar with some words most native speakers didnt knew that existed.)
One issue I have with Etherium EVM is when contracts run out of gas. All modifications to persistant memory are rolled back in such a situation yet the gas is spent. But I understand that the author(s) of Etherium didnt want to burden contract writers with dealing with inconsistant state nor enable denial of service attacks against miners or others verifing transactions.
I am trying to think of what else I wanted to add to this.

The most obvious and noticed difference between Ethereum EVM code and Bitcoin Script is that the latter is not Turing Complete and is guranteed to halt. That is finish execution. In the former they claim to solve the same problem while providinng Turing Completeness by using the concept of gas.
In Bitcoin Script the execution can only skip ahead and never backtrack. This is achived by construction as there is no arbritary jumping allowed.

Here follows my opinion:
The Ethereum Virtual Machine is extremely shitty to code for and read such code.
There are reasons why Satoshi choose to model bitcoin scripts on Forth and yet those reasons seems to have eluded whoever designed EVM.
I could go into minutae about the aforesaid reason if anyone is intrested.
The programming languages that use EVM as compilation target seem to be overly complicated yet not as proovable type safe as say Haskell or Coq. The output of aforesaid compilers makes it hard to inspect and translate back to the original or similiar source code. The inspection must be done if you do not want those compilers as part of your Trusted Computing Base of the contract(s) you use or write. (Cue reference to Kings' On Trusting Trust talk).

In a way, havent gotten so far yet in this write up.
But in short the contract bug as far as I understand it is about failure to take reentrancy into account.
There is no race (as there is no timing issue) as there is conceptually only one single thread of execution that winds it way from the transaction triggering, possibly recursively, calls to other contracts.
In unstandardized psuedo code it is something like this:
  
    contract Alice:
      positive_integer X := 420
      routine A:
        call routine B of passed in contract_address with X as a parameter passed
        X := 0
        return to routines A caller
 
    contract Bob:
      boolean k = false
      routine B:
         ignore parameter X passed in as it doesnt affect this example
         if k == false then
           call routine A in contract Alice, pass contract Bob as parameter
           k := true
         label F
Now when the routine A of Alice contract is invoked with Bob contract as parameter then
you would get a callstack that looks something like:
    &lt;Alices caller&gt;
      &lt;Alice routine A, continue right after the call to routine B in contract passed in&gt;
        &lt;Bob routine B, k == false, continue right after the call to routine A in contract Alice&gt;
          &lt;Alice routine A, continue right after the call to routine B in contract passed in&gt;
             &lt;Bob routine B, k == true&gt;
at the time label F is reached.  As you see X is passed to routine B twice with the value of 420.
I hope this clears it up a bit.

To readilly convert USD to BTC and maybe vice versa.


That information is quite often very confidential and private. If you must give that information then first encrypt with an public key from the IRS.*


The bank account that USDs will be comming from into Coinbase.


Well that violates other business relationship confidentialities. Those financial statements are though part of your tax reporting so just give exact references to those documents.*


This doesnt apply for individuals.


Just state the truth. Basically if you expecting to sell a lot of USD and buy BTC then state so.
The above should fullfill the requirements of the Money Laundering Regulations without giving Coinbase a trove of data that they can mine for their own benefits.

Rules that many follow regarding these kind of transactions:
1. If the counter party tells you what it is for then cancel out of the whole deal.
 Do this regardless of the legality of what they are going to do with it.
2. Get their bitcoin address and amount first. (If you are one with Bitcoin they with the cash)
3. Get handed the cash, verify each bill (USD Federal Reserve Notes are freakishly easier to counterfeit than other banknotes btw). Then put them down on the table and something heavy ontop, in view of both parties. Dont let the bills get out of your view.
4. That done, send the transaction from your wallet and wait for first confirmation. When it arrives and they confirm, pick up the cash.
5. Do not transfer more than you are willing to lose in single transaction. Repeat 2.-4. as many times as you are willing.
This procedure is a bit of a PITA indeed but better safe than sorry.

Because Visa got themselfs into dominant market position over many decades and many consumers found them handy, specially when many companies started to pay wages through direct deposit only. Paypal got themselfs into similiar market position by long term bait and switch tactics that are well known today.
This is the reason why many merchants give you discount if you pay with cash or bitcoin. (Basically you are paying the real price and not the merchant's extra credit card fees.)

Sorry the converse is too often true too, so useless criterion


Well this might be an 'fancy postal address' which is basically an glorified P.O.Box. You must verify it by going to the place or get someone to do so.


Plenty of scam company registers, how are you going to detect those? Hell many 'companies' are legally registered but turn out to be a drawer-company at some lawyer firm where an junior 'assoicate' is the one who registered it. So useless criterion.


So, you havent experienced the cost and hassle in getting merchant account to process credit cards and debit cards have you? Specially one that accepts 'card not present' transactions, which is basically what all 'net originated transactions are. So useless criterion yet again.

Which one? There are at least three diffrent chains of it now.
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:24:07
Forth is indeed closer to assembly language than say C.
It also targets what is called a dual stack machine. (One stack for data and such and one for return addresses.) This dual stack machine is usually cheaply emulated on most processor architectures.
However most Forth environments make it extremely easy to concatinatively construct more complex routines or words from extremely simple primitives or other such beforehand constructed routines.
This means that you can examine each routine and understand what it does if you understand the routines and primitives it invokes. You then can use those routines as known 'vetted' building blocks for making more complex ones. This cuts down on mind numbing repeation when someone has to go through the code (eather in source or binary form)
It also means that the executable binary code is often much much smaller than if you had
to inline various routines.
Btw this makes branch predictors shit bricks because Forth code is mostly branches or calls to other simpler routines. (I wish I could turn pipelining and branch prediction completely off. Forth systems usually fit easily in nowdays caches) 
Now, EVM seems to follow the Harvard architecture of having two diffrent memory spaces, one static one for program instructions and one for data. I applaud this but I am a bit baffled why there were no support of using other contracts code directly (basically in the same contract runtime instance) by refering to that code via sha256 or some such hash of it or the containing contract. (You can load bytes from another contracts binary into data memory though)

It is not needed by any AML/KYC law. You only need to give them a verified scan of your govermental backed ID.
Banks or other financial institutions that are asking for this kind of information under KYC are actually doing it for marketeering research.
If they persist in asking for this information then do what I did.
Put the occupation as Other, Monthly Incomming to other or highest available option, same with 'Total Net Worth'. And so on. If they get back to you that it looks strange then inform them that they are not allowed to gather such information for marketeering research and such questions are not allowed to be part of KYC forms.

Gee, is that secret sharing scheme still being used?
A better and much simpler one is the n-of-n secret sharing by random sum.
Basically you choose an glaois field in which the secret number is to expressed, lets say 2 for simplicty. So the secret is x bits long. Could be an utf-8 string. For each bit of the secret make y many shares by tossing a fair coin* y-1 times. Each coin toss outcome is a share. For the last share sum up all the other shares modulo 2 (basically xor), if the sum is equiv to the secret bit then the last share is zero, otherwise it is one.
Saw this secret sharing scheme in a paper by  [Ueli Maurer](
(* fair coin is basically a coin tossed in this way: Toss it twice, if the toss results are different then use the first toss as the outcome, if same then toss the coin again until you do not get the same result twice in a row then use the second to last toss as the result)

I am not an economist but I have the inclanation to beleave that inflationary fiat currencies (which most of fiat currencies are) have the hot potato effect of who unwittingly ever gets it last gets burned. The last one gets the least value as the money supply has inflated more in the interval between the origination of it (printing basicly) and when it is in the last one's hand.
Currencies with fixed monetary supply or 'hoard tax' (the notes are worth 1% less of its face value each month from it creation date, iirc) do not have the same kind of pressure as inflationary fiat currencies to be spent right way to the next sucker. In the 'hoard tax' case everyone knows that the bills will be worth less than the face value as longer it is from its creation date and can plan accordingly.

And this is why banks (well quite a few of them) have routing rulesets that re-route around failing 'corrispodent banks'.
Heck some banks set up accounts at other destination banks if a) there are frequent enough transfers to accounts at that bank, b) lots of many small transfers to lot of accounts at the same destination bank (pooling of wire fees basically) or c) an intermeditery corrispondence bank arbritary decide to fub tranfers because they do not like the originating or destination accounts.
To cover AML/KYC the source bank sends the destination bank a list of the transactions and who are doing them. The intermeditery corrispondence bank does not need to know.

someone that does not do their research properly.
Here is a thing, I live in Iceland and I am a bit involved in the cryptocurrency community here and I have asked around about this power consumption and enviromental impact.
All Bitcoin mining here currently consume about two or three aluminum electrosis vats worth of electricity. The aluminum industry here consumes about FOURTEEN TIMES the domistic usage does. So, turn off or make it economical for an aluminum smelter company here to run say five less electrolisis vats and I think it would most likely cover most of Bitcoin mining power usage here quite easily with lots of 'room' to expand.

It is only guranteed to be legal tender for public debts (that is, taxes, fines and such).
Lenders can write their contracts to include that fiat currency is not acceptable payment and if the debtor tries to pay with such then the lender is free to refuse and publish that you didnt honor the contract. However the state/goverment wont enforce the contract but there is nothing preventing others compiling detailed blacklists and using those to refuse business to the debtor. (Other than bare minimum subsistance that is. Meaning you can buy bottles of water, something plain to eat and perhaps sleeping bag space or something similiar.)

An assurance contract is a contract between some provider of a public good (infrastructure, a free game et ceterata) and unbounded number of sponsors.
If a certain minimum amount of money has been dedicated to it prior a certain time and date then everyone who sponsor it pays their sum and the provider build the bridge, makes the game or otherwise provides the public good to everyone who wants. If the minimum isnt reached then the sponsors do not have to pay and the provider does not have to provide the good.
A good realworld example of this is the stuff kickstarter enables via their system which built ontop of donations to them.

There is nothing preventing miners from limit the block size they work with to say 100 MB and order the unconfirmed transaction by tx fees. (The txn with the highest fee goes first).
To prevent txn with small or no fee from never making into the blockchain one can order the unconfiremd transaction by oldest and most fees.
That way txn with low fees get into the blockchain after a while.

You are falling into the trap the article talks about.
And no, an bitcoin address is not a 'legal entity'. It is merely the public key (or the cryptographic hash thereof) of a public key private key pair. That is all that it is.
Whatever entity that knows the corrisponding private key can make and sign new transactions, 'moving' the 'ownership' of some satoshi units around. And that entity could be a computer program running on, say, Raspberry PI, that has its own solar charged powerbank and prepaid SIM 4G cellular modem. All that inside a weatherproof enclosure installed, out of the way without anyone knowing or caring, on an antenna pole ontop of anonymous apartment building. Is that thing a 'legal entity'? No. Does the Bitcoin protocol and network care? No. Does the 4G telecomms provider care so long as the sim is topped up regularly? No.

what followers of Keynes hypothesis* of economics seem often forget that an inflationary currency disorts price signals.
Simple scenario: Lets say Bob is a farmer and is deciding on what kind of crop he wants to produce on one of his acres. He can plant wheet, carrots or ananas. He wants to save up a bit of cash to upgrade his tractor so it is more fuel efficient. He notices that futures** for carrots have a slightly higher average price than those of wheet and ananas, in ,,deflationary spiral'' currency system that signifies more demand but in Keynesian currency system might just be other carrot farmers expecting their currency to be worth less.
This is at least how I understand one of the effects Keynesian economic hypothesis* has.

Nope, it only make it legal tender for public debts. Loan contracts can state that they are only repayable in certain commodities, currencies, stocks and or other such fungible stuff. The thing is goverments wont enforce such contracts but there is nothing preventing the issuer of the loan to publicize a blacklist of those who try to go around the terms and pay with goverment issued currency. Others are then free to enforce the blacklist by not doing business with the parties listed, however they see fit. (Exceptions are first aid, minimum water and subsistance)

IMEI numbers are not as unique as many think. Many cheap asian phones from one manifacturer share an IMEI number due to manifacturers lazyness.
Also if you are so inclined you can reflash the IMEI of many phones. It is quite legal to buy or get old phones, extract their IMEI number, chuck the old phone into material recycling and then reuse it on a new phone.

That is what those regulations are ostensibly for but in practice they are used mostly as figleaf for police activity that violates rights of people.




And here is where common law systems and civil law systems differ. Each case in a category must be examined on the exact same basis and with the same methodology otherwise the principle of equalance of person before the law is violated. Which would wind up as a human rights violation.
Btw another difference is that there is no such thing as case law per say. However a judge can use prior cases in that category to inform himself of what was done before and why but is not bound by those decisions. He will have to justify why in eather case though.

My point is that they are in the eyes of the law equivalent.
Which is an issue when people get hit by them unjustly. They and others seeing that go and fall into a thinking trap which I must explain.
Where I live, which is in Iceland, it happens that there have evolved two kinds of rulesets so to speak.
One set is pretty much the legislative and liability kind. Violating those rules only have legal kind of consequences most often enforced through social constructs such as courts.
The other set is more of "DO NOT GO BEYOND THIS POINT AS THE CLIFF IS BRITTLE AND CAN GIVE AWAY UNDERNEATH YOU" kind. Consequences of violating these are not metered out by any human or social construct but by nature and physics. 
The thought trap is that many equate the two as the same when they are not. The former is often just at the whim of a ruler or other legislating institution. The second is most often due to that we are depressively-tired of scraping up dead or crippled tourists that think it is okay to violate them.

There is no questioning of if the reason for the law is actually regulatory capture.
This kind of thinking of that all laws/rulesets/rules are equiv has caused me and other no end of grief regarding safety rules. And I mean safety rules around quite dangerous equipment and or machines.
That means that the following disambigiouation must be done and explained:
There are at least two kinds of rules, one kind of rules are safety rules that can result in injury, death, unmitigatable ecological damage and such. We rather not have to go through the sorrow and having to scrape up your remains. Basically rules that have good damn reasons for them. Then there are rules made just to exercise authority, get unruly children to stop lollygagging or raise barriers of entry to markets or activity. Basically rules whose reason boils down to "just because..,".

How you, or a regulator might, jump to that conclusion is remarkable.
Why because 'avoiding the law to register' only shows intent to avoid said law to register.
A metamorphical scenario is in order to illustrate what I mean.
Lets say you own a lot on a street with quite a bit of foot traffic and you want to sell soda pop via a vending machine at the property line. (Lets say that you build a bit of a three wall shed for the vending machine.)
You go buy a used vending machine for the purpose and get it thorougly inspected by vending machine technician (it is cheaper to be sure that it does not break on you) that it works without any issues. You set it up in its place and fill it with cans of soda.
But there is a law that states all vending machines must be registered and you intend not to through that hassle as it is both expensive, pointless and was only put in place due to lobbying by an association of bodegas.
Now I ask, how can the fact that you did not register be construed into that you intend to fraud your soda buying customers?
Btw, this was not a strawman or similie to the SEC 'accrediated investor' issue but purely to point out this issue regarding intent.

What has happended when those USA laws were changed to try to reach beyond the borders of USA is that many "US National" lost the control over their accounts. A local agent was often apointed for them. A bit like for underage children get that inheritance or in other such circumstances.
It has also resulted in foreign disinvestment in USA. That is, foreign banks, brokers and other financial institutions are getting rid of their investments in USA. Often by doing investment swaps against their former "US National" clients.

My guess is because many look at private central banks as corupt self serving organization or component of such.
A bit offtopic: Ask yourself why do boom and bust cycles occur? My personal hypothesis is that the rarity of money (how much there is of it) has become decaupled from actual rarity of economic resources (how much there is of resources such as energy, materials, equipment and workforce). The proplem is better known as "too much money chasing too few things*". One question that pops up at the juncture is why things seems to be equally or more expensive now than it used to be. As knowledge increases on how to better use resources the less it cost to make something or provide a service requiring those somethings. (Increased efficiency of resource use also opens up new phase spaces of what is possible to do)

If an x amount of monetary unit buys less and less as times goes on then stores, wages, fees and such need to be constantly updated as that monetary unit cannot function as a unit of account.
This results in higher velocity of that monetary unit. (Shorter time between ownership changes of a unit) When that velocity goes over a certain threashold people will literally start to burn it (because it is better fuel than that stack can buy) or try to get rid of it as fast as possible. What does that result in? Unwise investments into pie-in-the-sky enterprises that with a little dilligence can be seen beforehand that they will never work. Good example of that is the defunct pet.com.
What is called 'modern economics' have little or none basis in physical reality even though it is meant to cover resource allocation, promote specialization and progress (which increases overall efficency) and usage. In that regard Keynesian thought fails miserably both in predictive power and as a framework for decisions.

That is only reported inflation. Take something stable such as a loaf of bread or can of green beans and compare the prices over same period. Their price should be droping as improvements in production lowers their production costs. Have they?


Actually it does. It impacts them mostly in the way that prices keep going up while their wages fall behind due to their lack of negotation power. (If they demand higher wages they are more likely to be fired than getting the raise).
Also the poor is, collectively, the biggest holder of cash as USA banks are usually too expensive for them to bank with.


Not all of the poor are in debt and those that are are most likely paying high intrest due to them being risky clientele. Oh and look up price indexed loans too.


The purpose of cash is to be a stable medium of exchange to factiliate economic activity between consenting actors.
How can it represent value without being valuable? Its value is only based on the full credit and honor of its issuer, you might as well
use matador money or other game tokens.
Also if an issuer keeps issuing more of a currency then, due to the well known supply and demand, the less each unit of it is worth less and less. That is basically what inflation is. Would rather have constant demurrage than inflation.


Too many non-sequitors in that paragraph and why does this false dichotonomy of deflation and inflation come about?


Sure it is easier to maintain stable than deflation yet it is pretty unstable.


Have you actually tried to invest your spare cash? The hurdle rate on investments is still rather higher than just holding cash.


Cash is mostly not used for growth, production or investment, it is mostly used for settlement of accounts or exchange of goods or services.


I reiterate, have you actually tried to invest your spare cash? Could a poor unbanked person do such investment?


I do not expect positive return of cash that is shoved in a closet, nor do I expect a negative return on it yet inflation imposes negative return on it.


Oh? I thought investments have positive return mostly because they are being hyped up on Wall Street markets. I see more and more of actual real investment declining.


Where did I declare such assumption? Nowhere in those posts that you are responding to.


No, I dont expect them to turn into handyman business but I __do__ expect them to be there when I need a screwdriver for something. A property that cash doesnt have due to inflation. (Basically, the utility of a mountain of screwdrivers in my basement is constant while the utility of cash shoved into a closet declines at unpredictable but downward rate.)


___(emphasis mine)___: Yes only nominal profits. The word nominal means in name only which pretty much translates into no profit beyond sales growth.


That equity or capital for lender to lend to the shopkeepers must actually exist eather as resources or production capacity before the shopkeepers can use it to enlarge or optimize their business, no?




Are two weeks long term? Half a year? Three months?


Circular logic is circular.


Any extra they could put away is eaten up by inflation. Before you say "they should just deposit in an savings account" I point you yet again to the fact that many are unbanked.


Undoubtly and I applaud those organizations. I fear those efforts will be probably retarded or squashed by financial predators such as credit card companies, american banks and cheque to cash businesses that pray on the poor.


Most people are ignorant on most matters. Mostly because people often do not bother to rectify their ignorance.
If you expect people to be not as ignorant of how to deal with their wealth as of most matters then I have a freicoin for you.
So by your assertation most people are hurt by inflation.
And you apearantly havent had penny stocks, mutual fund shares or other such financial instruments fall through on you.


Are you talking about bitcoin the monetary unit or are you talking about bitcoin the distributed proof-of-work securing of transactions against double spending technology? Probably the former.


Wont happen overnight all transitions take time and transitions of that magnitude will take longer than one night. Oh, and I think it would happen gratually as people realize how hard it is for governments to seize than bank account balances (the goverments would have to take posession of the actual private keys instead of bullying the bank or financial institution) but that is whole another discussion.


No, I do not expect the value of bitcoin going to the moon (or exponentially increase). There would still be production as people still have to eat, need housing, clothes, toileteries and so forth. They will aslo desire entertainment and such. There might only be development and or growth to meet actual demand instead of just acting like a cash sink.


And how is this diffirent from current banking and wars? Study history and not only the books written by the victors.


No, that honor will fall to idiocity, greed and failed Keynesianism or other economic polices based on its flawd premises.
And the mostly stable long term medium of exchange would probably be canned food and honey not inflationary fiat or deflationary bitcoin.

Let me poke some holes into this.
You assume that your salary (if that is the source of income) will be all in fiat or tracable cryptocurrency. Doing a bit extra and getting paid for it without reporting is something that happens today and more than you think. (Usually such payment is in cash).
Then there is the question of "purchasing way above your market". There is a fictional story on the 'Net somewhere of a crew of armoured vans faking being robbed so they could swipe the moolah themselfs. One part of that story is their discussion on how to  not mark themselfs out afterwards by going on spending sprees. This involved them each keeping home-budgets and such. Keeping track of how much they earned normally, budgetting for mortage payments or rent, utilities, savings and groceries. The last two were curcial because they budgeted as little as possible for groceries and put the rest in the savings. Then whenever any one of them went to buy such stuff they would pay cash, from the loot, and just buy normally. Ditto when buying takeout food and such. This has the effect of making plausable denial possible, later when those savings are big enough to pay off mortage, buy a house or whatever.

It would work like this in the case of bitcoins: You work for a business for both USD and bitcoins. What you are paid in USD is recorded, taxed et ceterata. What you are paid in bitcoins isnt allowing the business to pay you less in USD and hence less taxes to the government.
Now, just replace bitcoins with Swiss/Cayman Bank Accounts or what ever other wierd finicial instruments wallstreeters can think of and basicly you got how the C's of companies are usually paid.

Write with a felt tipped pen "For &lt;exchange name&gt; Use Only" plus the date in rfc3339 format a few times. Then when scanning your id documents have that sheet between the document and scanner. This makes it much harder for identity thiefs to use those scans elsewhere.

Legal tender only means that it must be accepted to pay for debt. Nothing more. Otherwise places where you pay up front couldnt refuse cash or coins.
Here is a kicker though, anyone can refuse 'legal tender' as payment for debt which only means that they cannot sic collection agency or use the courts to get it paid. However it does not stop them from refusing the debtor further service and advertise|let-it-be-known why they are refusing the debtor spefically. And others are free to use that reputation info for charging the debtor more or refusing service.

Yes, up until when paypal decides that you have violated some unstated terms and freeze your account and only give your money back after 90 days without intrest.

Yes, provided the money supply is static in relation to the economic throughput of the society using that currency. As soon as banks or other such private institutions are allowed to issue more than there is value for then bad things such as inflation happens. When the supply stagnates you get deflation which can be a problem for non digital currencies. (A matter of divisibility basicly)

That question raises many intresting philosophical questions.


Only due to the fact that the security and access control in most of the operating systems which the bitcoin nodes runs on top of is laughable at best. I know one factor to the solution to that but there also other unkown factors needed. (Anyone intrested just pm me)


When the mining nodes no longer automatically get 50 btc (or 25 btc) bounty I expect that many miners will tear their rigs down and the difficulty to drop because the return of investment will not pay for the electricty.


Using coal to make electricty instead of wind, hydro or solar power is idiotic. A good sized mining rig could easily be powered by a small wind turbine, few photovoltaic cells with fresner lenses and so on.




Also consider that hit contracts targeting those loan sharks and slave traders would be possible with bitcoins.

There are two unwritten rules that are rather simple: economic activity gets taxed where it occurs and sovereignity of countries get respected (each country can tax what they want inside it and how they want)
FACTA violates both these with impunity.
Hell, FACTA could even be used as a weapon against spefic USA citizens.
A beneficary fund can be set up, in say Saudi Arabia, for an USA citizen with the stipulations that it will keep the benefits in trust until said citizen as renounced their USA citizenship (you can put all kinds of conditions on beneficary funds). The fund dutifully reports the balance to IRS due to FACTA but the citizen must pay the tax in USA or their USA assets are seized and auctioned off to pay the crushingly high tax.

The double SHA256 hash algorithm that bitcoin uses in its hashcash* calculation per block is Damgård-Merkle construction iirc. 
Merkle trees are a way to construct a hash of lot of data by spliting the aforesaid data into chunks, calculate the hash of each chunk then concatinate those together into a new chunk, calculate the hash of that and so on until you only have one hash left.
This is how bitcoin blocks are put together (been a while since I read the paper). As the bitcoin protocol rewards the one who finds a hash that fullfills the criterions of the hashcash function of bitcoin (basically the hash, treated as a number, must be below certain target number) you could say that bitcoins grow on Merkle trees ;-)
(* basically that the resulting hash of some datablock treated as a number must be below certain target number or have x many 0 bits in MostSignificantBit positions)

You apearently do not know how software update works nowdays.
Usually the updater downloads the update package of the software and then checks if it is signed by the private key corrisponding to the public key the updater has built in. If the signiture is authentic then it applies the update otherwise it discards it.

To get cash or coins:
1. select that option
2. show QR code or enter address by hand for change/failure purposes.
3. scan QR code or enter address displayed by the ATM into your phone or what ever
4. get an printed promisary note (that if exipres before redeemtion then coins sent to the address from step 3 will be sent back to address from step 2)
5. Done for now
To redeem the promisary note:
1. select that option
2. scan it with the ATM
3. eather get the cash/coins or status on how many confirmations are required before it is possible.

Mind I rebutt your rebuttals?




Recurrent payments for bills and such do not belong in the layer where payments are made. This is a service you could buy from a provider of such. (Have you tried to get your bank or credit union to pay routine bills so long they are, each, under some maxiums you specify? My experience is that they dont want to deal with that hassle.)


It has been a long time since interest rate on most bank accounts have been above actual inflation.


Which is, incidently, why many people tell them not to use exchanges accounts as bank accounts.


You* cant spend yourself* into prosperous economy, contrary to popular belief. (* Both plural version of you). Much of such 'economic activity' is mostly consumption and not investing.
 Investing in real world capital is the way but that requires due dilligence by the investor which you dont get when people are trying to flee NIRs.


So, why is some monetary policy in some country a concern of the people transacting?
Paying a dress makers in India with bitcoin circumvents the hassle of the payment not getting there due to suspiction of 'terrorism assistance' like happened to a Danish shopkeeper that commissioned such dresses.


Use an escrow service then, this is something that FedEx or such could offer cheaply. Or even offered by Visa or MasterCard like they do, implictly, with credit cards.


Could you explain it to us why it is a bad thing?


Then you arent familiar with smart contracts such as those that Ethereum supports.


it ties into escrow for when you buy stuff online and have it delivered to you. This makes it possible for such arrengements to be explict rather implict and done by default with the credit card company as the escrow.


If it adds concepts from Zerocash, Namecoin and Ethereum then it will be rather interesting to watch.


Lets see. The Federal reserve was founded after the independecne and creation of the United States of (north) America so it is less than two hundred years old. Before it most people used gold, silver or, sometimes, honey for international settlements. For more local concerns, tally staves (not sure about what they are called in English but Norweigans used them) kept track of debt owed and such. Rather stable, modulo hardships such as crop failures and such.
With the fed, well continual boom and bust cycles (one nasty one is called the Great Depression), continous printing of currency (quantive easing) and increasing debt that never goes away. To mention a few. I would say that the economy under the Fed had to become more resilient due it.


You are right, it is backed by threat of violent force while bitcoin is backed up with consensual consent that it has value.


Strange assertation, that. I personally find dollars** worth little as they are I-Owe-Untos issued by the USA government.
People in USA and doing business there find them somewhat more valueable as they are only thing accepted as payment for taxes. 
(** I assume here that you are talking about USD and not the dollars made of gold to old spanish specifications)


That strange assertion again. Most people agree that gold is valueable because it is rather rare, shiny and rather hard to fake. 


Depends on where he can exchange it more easily for, say, a hot meal. Because the network effect and it being the only accepted medium for payment of taxes most places more readily accept the USD.


Most would accept the USD because they know they can go to a nearby beuro de exchange and get local currency for it but that isnt as certain if USD was not as well known worldwide as it is today.
What would you do if I offered you say 10000 ISK or 1 BTC?


Yes and same applies to USD or other govermental fiat currency. The exact reasons why differ between the cases of Bitcoin and USD.


Nor is your assertation that USD is accepted to have value by every person in the world.
I recommend you read what Nick Szabo has written on the history of money, trade and finance.

This also applies to, well, all fiat currencies. Anyone who has studied even in coarse superficial details the recent financial history will recall the manipulation of the United Kingdom pound versus the United States of America dollar.


Even regulated and registered exchanges can lead to losses.


So, it is prudent not to leave your coins on said exchange platforms.


Translated into usual everyday language: these currencies enable individuals to manage their own financial privacy, financing of freedom fighter or just their own private security and transportation of goods past 'revenue cutters' (which was always an euphuism for state sponsored piracy*).


Yeah, often such 'digitization' is supposedly due to 'anti-money laundering laws'. Two options there for people, avoid such exchanges or use transperancies to watermark their scans of passports.

Here is a rule of thumb for you, the real inflation is most likely three times that reported. So for the 2% per annum inflation in USA reported assume it is really 6%.
This pretty much means that anything you or anyone invest in therefore _MUST_ have higher return than those 6% and that in return must be moneytary otherwise you are losing value.
Because finding out what actually does return that much to invest in is a hard problem a lot gets funneled into boon-doggles marketed by silver tounged scamsters or imbelicelles.

No. Where does that absurdness originate?
Each transaction is put into a block and the whole block is hashed. 
That hash is put into a header. In that header is also the hash of prior header and a nonce. What the miners do is to change the nonce until the hash of the header is below the current target. That takes many many attempts. Calculating that hash and chaning the nonce is what the majority of a miners computing power is spent on. That computing power is spent regardless of how many transactions is in the block.

Then you should be familiar with something called logistics cost units . They are used in planning and execution of many projects that span many currency zones and possibly many years. Why not USD or such? Because USD is subjected to the whims of politics.
These logistics cost units are usually denoted in joules. 
Often the main feasibility question of a project is how much energy it takes to realize it.
From the aquirement of ores and raw resources, refining and procesing of them all the way to the end product, be it an electronics item or a terminal port. In this is included, among other things, the cost of shipping the ores, resources, parts and such around.
As technology becomes better, cheaper and enables more by lowering how many cost units something costs to realize the richer humanity becomes.
Of course using the prior existing infrastructure lowers logicstical costs. (For that part there is always mantenance costs)


Have you looked at salary and hiring contracts lately? They all have a clause where lack of increase of payment equal to inflation is seen as cutting wages. This completely negates your 'It is better to hold wages constant' argument for inflationary currency.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:04:55
And you need to make the distinction between saving and boon-doggling. The latter happens when you or agents of yours invests your money in stupid enterprises that then shows nothing for it, reward wise.
Investing in an inflationary system has quite the disadvantage, both to investors and society in whole. due to the inflation rate setting a minimum monetary return. This makes it harder for innovative companies or enterprises to give return in something other than money.


Or prices on things people actually want went up, due to inflation, between they getting paid or income raise.
Besides, you try to save up in inflationary currency for something you want. Kids that try to do that, from allowence or odd jobs, soon learn the pointlessness of it.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:33:53
An inflationary currency fo an economic structure would heavily increase its velocity until people try to get rid of it and get something a bit longer lasting in value.

You sure the guy admitted to violating ToS of Coinbase? At least he or she did not say so in the original post, afaict.
The story so far as I understand it:
Coinbase decided, for some arbitrary reason not stated anywhere that, they did not want to continue to do business with Sofikor and asked him or her to move their coins off Coinbase
Sofikor pretty much responded with, alright then I have no idea why you are doing this but let me transfer my coins of your exchange then.
Coinbase then stopped responding at all.
Sofikor is quite pissed at Coinbase for not allowing him or her to finish what Coinbase started, the termination of their business relationship.
The suspiction is now that Coinbase is attempting theft. Given priori that many cybercoin exchanges have started to act shady and pulling off what is now often called 'sudden account closure scam' it is not that unreasonable to hold forth that Coinbase has begun to pull off such scam.

Legally? Well, you can sue anyone for anything in most legal systems.
You, like amicablegradient above, are falling into the same trap.
The question that amicablegradient put forth is basically about BTC addresses being 'legal entities'.
They arent. And because autonomous systems, such as the Raspberry PI setup I descrbied, not owned by anybody can keep and use private keys to sign transactions then institutions such as SEC has no 'legal entity' to sue per se for breach of securities trading law.

Many people want to be able to do such purchases with cash because the seller can be sure of the finality of the payment.
Something that no credit card or cheque (even cashiers cheque) can gurantee.

Btc at least is not inflatable and putting fiat IOUs under your matterss is risky in the regard of not being accepted currency after a few years. (That is old design of bills become worthless besides their numastic value)
Ever heard the expression of having money burning through your pocket? Bascily it means that you lose more value the longer you wait due to inflation.
Also. When you can transfer value to anyone or thing in ther world without having to go through time consuming KYC/AML in banktransfers or credit card charges by simply signing an transaction detailing that transfer and publishing it to the blockchain then you do not have much need for expensive middle men.

A very rough and fast description on how an end users OR connects to an hidden service:
1. First it makes an connection through Tor to a directory service.
2. That directory service keeps, among other things, rendevous endpoint entries signed by the hidden service public key. (The .onion address is an crypto graphic hash of the public key). The directory service returns such an entry to the end user OR.
3. That OR then builds an tunnel towards the rendevous point and sends and onion for building a tunnel back to the OR through it.
4. The hidden service OR gets that onion and builds an tunnel back to the OR.
Now, the end user OR and hidden service OR have established a communication channel.
OR, btw, stands for Onion Router.

It might also be handy for keeping bitcoin-notes/-bills. Or keeping a printed copy of a private key. Or for smuggling transactions on paper (avian internet anyone? and yes I tried pretty hard to think up uses)

I have the hypothesis that one factor in how cheap USD is getting relative to BTC* is the slow and stead evaporation of trust in centrally issued currencies. That evaporation is probably due to the public perception that there is a small group benefiting on the peoples dime (People not part of this small group). Also the possibility of controling your own moolah and not be subject to arbitrary confiscation/blocking. (See the cyprot situation, paypal hate and visa&amp;mastercards blocking of wikileaks donations. )
(* I reverse the usual base of value here to point out one absurdity. It is that a currency is suposed to, among other factors, be a measure of value. Due to the unknown inflation of USD in this example it would be as you were measuring lengths with an elastic cord. But I disgress)

On the first: Does the Turing completeness have to be, well, complete or is settable limits such as how long (measured in instructions not millsec) a script can run or other limits such as on the combinatory complexity of the possible values of the combinational boolean circuits whose result determine when said script finishes?
On the second: oh, damn yes, I agree with you completely there.
And finally on the third: yes, actually keeping the record of the transactions is equally important as enabling new additions/appenings to it. Something like the Eternity Storage protocol comes to mind but that isnt much workable in this instance. Really a poser this one I must admitt.

Security through obscurity never works, sadly. But sealed box with the MCU, NFC reader, the 2x16 LCD and the PIN keypad might work.  Just make sure the communication from that box to the service is properly encrypted.

In short it works both ways.
