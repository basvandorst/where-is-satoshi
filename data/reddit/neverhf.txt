Wow, you must have read a different statement than I. You should read Alex Morcos (a Core dev)'s posts at  they're really quite informative.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:28:20
Hmm, wait, do full nodes listen to miners who give them invalid crap? oh, wait, they dont. doesnt matter, then.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:44:57
Oh? Are you sure about that? Or did you just read a letter from a bunch of companies that looked just like the last 4 letters that they threw away a week later and decided that this time its definitely, completely different.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:44:16
Bitpay told people to switch to btc1 "to upgrade to segwit", in what world is that sane? Irrespective of if you want to switch to using b2x or not, telling people that this is how you use segwit is blatantly false.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:24:38
I try :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:33:49
It is reasonable for them to tell well-informed users that they should run btc1 *if* they wish to use the 2xcoin. It is not reasonable for them to do so without informing their users.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:50:42
There absolutely were Classic and XT agreements. There were letters signed by a bunch (in fact more than NYA) of businesses and exchanges declaring they were switching to some other client, just like NYA.

I said the Bitcoin community is full of toxic people like Jeff, not Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:34:46
I think you mean one Core contributor's (who since gave up and moved to Litecoin cause Bitcoin is so full of toxic people like Jeff) current research line.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:50:15
Funny, I've seen that before...about 4 times, so far none of them went anywhere. Why is this one different?
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:45:24
TL;DR: "We refuse to accept the idea that miners don't control Bitcoin, refuse to accept the obvious fact that miners follow profitability and at least may not overwhelmingly switch to our fork, and thus refuse to protect users of Bitcoin and 2xCoin alike.",
or ELI5: "The Bitcoin community is just us, everyone who isnt already running btc1 doesn't exist"
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:37:34
What statement did you read? It talked about what Bitcoin Core was doing, not speaking for anyone else. Hell, it doesnt even tell people not to run btc1, only
"We strongly advise users not to download any Bitcoin full-node software claiming to be an ‘upgrade’ to Bitcoin’s consensus rules without carefully considering the impact of the proposed changes on the Bitcoin system and the level of community support for it. This includes proposed consensus changes in new releases of Bitcoin Core."

Usually when authors abandon things its because they decided to. Maybe you should think about why he did before you jump on it.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:04:18


Heh, I see what you did there...let the 2x morons think you're referring to them while really referring to the Segwit upgrade
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:33:14
Except that at least 50% of hashpower has proven that it just follows the chain that pays them the most.....so the claims by the 2x folks are disingenuous at best, blatant attempts at manipulation, more likely.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:46:13
Mods are being lazy, I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:41:19


Or what if...they just dont? Dont be an idiot and think that NO miners are going to mine Bitcoin, maybe even most wont, but there are a ton of miners and a lot of hashpower out there.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:11:26
Fair, anyway my point here was that its not unprecedented but dont equate the project of one contributor talking about what he thinks uncontroversial forks should look like with "what Bitcoin Core thinks" or how controversial forks like 2x should work.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:55:07
I think you've been bamboozled. You're free to define Bitcoin how you like (with whatever consensus rules you like), you're not forced to just blindly follow miners.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:12:33
Well, and BIP 148. Segwit happened because everyone got to claim they won all while doing the same thing.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:42:41
OK, sorry, everyone except companies shill-bert invested in, and @_date: 2017-08-18 21:32:51
There is nothing in the OP that talks about larger block sizes, fuck it reaffirms support for segwit (a block size increase).
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:22:51
Pretty much everyone except companies shill-bert invested in?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:51:20
Oops, sorry, OK, companies from one investor and 2 redditors, out of, what, 300k subscribers? OK, lets go 2x!
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:06:48
Wait, did they really try to imply that CW is Satoshi? That the guy who screams random nonsense should be equated to well spoken Satoshi is insulting.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:46:33
Yea, but where do they stand *now*, things have changed a ton since then.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:18:50
Heh, love how journalists always teach the controversy, as if both sides are equally valid. I mean just talk to the guy for 5 minutes and tell me he isnt a complete dipshit.
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:19:17
The XT one was  and  I dont have a link to the classic one atm, but they had a list of supporters on their site, I'm sure its not hard to find on archive.org or so (there was a bunch of drama around Classic about people who were put on the list who apparently didnt sign).
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:25:37
Really? The participants intended to follow through on the XT agreement, oh and the Classic agreemnt, and there was a lot of noise about Unlimited...why do you think its different this time?
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:48:51
Why is this satire? Even if you support 2x, this is a much safer codebase to run for the next two months until the btc1 codebase is more mature and people have carefully audited it.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:04:50


What is wrong with registering a new account to promote a new project? I do not work for anyone, I did this because I think it is a much safer solution both for those who do not want Segwit2x, and those who do!
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:57:22
This signals and enforces BIP 91, unlike Core, and in compatibility with Segwit2x. It does not, however, contain the rushed-and-unreviewed hard fork code in segwit2x (if you want to run that, you should wait a month and run it later when it gets more review, run this in the meantime!).
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:20:55
Man this guy...highlights contributions from others but neglects to mention his own.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:54:22
2XWithoutTheBadParts is based on that, thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:30:01
Wait, which innovation? The one that was shown to be insecure at  ?
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:09:30


So...you love Bitcoin because you get to store it in a bank (or an exchange or whatever)? I'm confused. Maybe Craig should hire better shills.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:46:35
I believe the pairity folks built one, but its entirely unmaintained (and not complete) :(
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:18:06
2XWithoutTheBadParts does not propose any new standards - it only implements 2X in a much safer way (by dropping the hard fork part for now - people can go re-add it later when the code for it is stable and has been reviewed for at least a month or two).
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:24:45


btc1 contains massively rushed hard fork code that needs at least a month or two to get reviews and careful analysis. Until then, its much better to run something like this, which is much simpler code and compatible with Segwit2x until the hard fork, which isn't for at least 3 months.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:26:31
Done! Though its really mostly (and jl2012, a Core dev) work.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:07:23
Great idea! I'll do that (are they on reddit?)
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:47:36


I think you've been reading too much Craig Wright spam, do not fall victim to his obvious scams and carefully consider *who* you are trusting, its always someone, at least with your own node its your software!
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:28:08


Paging @_date: 2017-07-16 21:02:40
It sidesteps the issue of complete lack of code review for the hard fork part for a few months - you can run this for the next 2 months and be completely compatible without the big risks of running incredibly fresh code (the code here is much, much simpler and written mostly by Core devs, I just changed the version strings).
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:59:49
So? I registered a new account to promote my project (which is much, much safer a client for those who want to support SegWit2x, they can run this for the next few months instead and avoid a lot of very risky, very new code).
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:16:27
I'm using travis for CI - see the pending build at 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:37:34


Perhaps point out the issue if I said something wrong instead of ad-hominems against a pseudonym?
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:40:12
It also identifies itself as a 2x client (using the same version number as btc1).
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:27:11


Absolutely! But I'm sure there will be a few out there who will run 2x anyway, for example those who do not want to accept the BIP 91 blocks which will be orphaned. For them, they absolutely should be running 2XWithoutTheBadParts instead!
