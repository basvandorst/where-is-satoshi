That list means nothing. What I mean is businesses selling goods and services for only BTC and nothing else, not USD or Euros but only BTC. Such a business does not exist, and until one does BTC is worthless.
Also, back to my original question: why is the ledger alone of any value?

Goods and services have value. And there are no businesses selling goods and services in exchange for BTC yet. 
Why do you think the ledger alone has any value? If in the future, there are no products being sold in BTC, do you still think the ledger will have any value?

Actually, no. There are zero Bitcoin transactions occurring to exchange goods and services. The only Bitcoin transactions occurring are buying and selling other currencies.


It's the only standard that counts. Till a commodity that people want is sold only in Bitcoin, nobody is going to really need Bitcoin. That is how currency exchange rates work. Demand and supply. People acquire USD because they want to buy commodities sold only in USD in the United States. The market value of USD goes up. If the United States economy tanks and goods/service production slows down, fewer people will need USD to pay for these goods/services and the USD market value will fall.
In the list of businesses you pasted above who take Bitcoin in addition to USD, Euros, etc. who in their right mind is going to pay for anything with their Bitcoin, knowing how volatile the Bitcoin markets are and knowing how long it takes for a transaction to complete? 
 


Currently the ledger is worthless, as is Bitcoin. Till people need (not 'choose to use', but 'need') Bitcoin to pay for goods and services and actual commerce is conducted in Bitcoin the currency has no fundamental value and nor does the ledger (or Blockchain)
