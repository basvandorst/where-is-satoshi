Bitcoin fanboys love to circle fap each other. Hodl!

Many analysts and exchange markets in October predicted that BTC will be 17k in March 2018… and look where are we

It's black PR.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:45:40
Today it's not profitable to mine BTC. Ether works better, you need 4-6 top GPU cards to make somewhat sense out of this business.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:57:02
This kinda obvious that it's a nickname. I don't believe it's just one guy.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:24:50
Meh use other services to change btc to usd, it safer than just a guy from the web
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:27:26
He's a scummer, don't trust him 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:27:07
My man!
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:17:52
Even local news in my shithole country showed report about btc, its reddit page, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:40:08
Just swap to BTC, you lose around 50 bucks in fees, but you will have around 0.15 btc
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:56:04
Well, someone sold pizza and earned 10k be happy for pizza man
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:14:16
Sold at 15k, btc will come back someday.
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:30:03
rip btc
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:03:39
So you saying you don't know? Hmm
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:40:14
circle jerk all over again
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:17:23
I guess it's very possible!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:29:22
don't care about Coinbase it even doesnt work in my country so..
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:07:29
well every trading platform says so 
Most experts predict solid 14-15k, just google bitcoin forecast 2018. Anyway seems like bitcoin will not stop to rise even if fall a bit. Analyst says about 100k in 10 yrs, so who knows how it would be 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:15:59
forecasts predict 17k next spring
so you can try
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:30:56
Good guy = selling drugs = Bitcoin fanboys
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:40:13
Wow guys are you stupid it's a scam! LoL and you all fell for it. How easy.
I'm Ukrainian and never heard about polit.com.ua, and it has outdated articles, website is dead. Major news didn't said about crypto uah, some guys in the govt said they want to create govt systems on blockchain, other said it would be cool to create crypto Hryvna(uah), that's all. 
Any official website ends with .gov.ua
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:38:26
haha you trying so hard. Kid, go buy plastic toy lambo.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:22:30
Correction. March 30. 6624$.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:23:20
lol those btc fanboys... it's going to happen, rip btc, to the moon 100k! yeah..
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:52:10
I sold everything at 15k.
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:51:17
Nice joke kid. Go buy some shitcoins coz it's gonna be 100k tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:47:08
So far without dollars, bitcoins are worthless. Ah irony
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:33:39
It will around 10k for long time I guess
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:44:56
LOL even Reddit says goodbye shitcoin. 1k soon, to the moon!
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:08:55
Yeah that's what fanboys love to say. Big fish with two btc lol. You all convert crypto to usd, that's why it has semi value. So far it's not part of global economy, but just shady stuff. If it had real value, you could say how much costs one pack of cigarettes in fucking Mongolia, you can't till you convert to cash or you gonna say that the price is 0.00000047? Yeah you can put a price, if everyone in the world would accept that the cost for example is 1BTC it will be so.
Any money just equivalent of resources that other guy has and you want to make change. We made them up and they have zero value. Crypto still need around 50 years to become something bigger than just cash for moon kids. It's about worldwide spread and not about cost of crypto to usd.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:50:39
I bought at 8, sold at 19. I wish crypto was more stable, so far it can't beat fiat.
