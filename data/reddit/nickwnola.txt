Depending on your coin just buy a hardware wallet like a trezor or keep key.  Otherwise put it in a regular wallet.    Get it off of an exchange.

Bitfinex by Bitfinex
I had downloaded this and not set up the site yet.  Didn't know it was fake. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:22:15
Well, when you put it that way it sounds suspicious but lets wait and see.  
I downloaded BitFinex and installed it Sunday.  Never used it.  I'm glad I didn't now.  
I'm just glad I keep everything in a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:13:19
During setup you are instructed to write down the recovery seed on the card provided.  Put that in a safe place, like a safe or safety deposit box.  If your keep key is destroyed or lost you can recover it to a new keepkey

Anytime, always glad to help.  I needed answers when I got into this as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:34:36
Well I think we need to look more into what happene as the news comes out,  I'm sure there would be an announcement if their wire/ACH data was compromised.  
I did not use Bitfinex, so I'm not sure how they did bank transfer.  I downloaded it Sunday and never set it up.  I use Coinbase and Gemini.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:15:02
The best thing is to just not use it.  Keep your coins off of Coinbase unless you are about to sell them.  they keep some of them in some form of offline storage.  I haven't seen much lately to make me feel comfortable in that.  Think of it this way.  It's like a bank, they mark that you have your coins on an account, then they throw all of it in together.  If you put it in the vault I'm pretty sure they allocate some of it to cold storage but really, I dont have a way of verifying that on the website.  That's why I'd rather have mine in a medium where I control it.  
@_date: 2016-08-09 05:53:14
Yes this is standard for KYC/AML requirements 
@_date: 2016-08-24 02:48:57
It's just a prepaid debit card.   
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:27:05
I should have mentioned the iOS app.  I went to the site as well. 
No I know about the fake bread wallet app.  
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:35:52
Is there a way to verify this?  I searched RedCross.org and there is no mention of a way to donate via bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:29:50
Well first pick a wallet.  There are several, a few popular ones are Breadwallet, Mycelium, Copay, and Jaxx. 
Before you put anything on them make sure you have written down your 12 Wood backup seed sentance and put it in a safe place.  
The use the receive address and send bitcoins to it from your Coinbase account.  
Pretty simple.  But put that seed In a safe place.  If you lose it your bitcoins are gone if you don't lose your device.  You may want to look into a hardware wallet like a ledger, keep key(i use this one), or a Trezor.  You can put that In a safe and the keys are safely stored inside it.

People still use yahoo mail?  It's always getting hacked.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:36:31
I mean you will have to pay a mining fee. For the transaction to get them there and back, but you can spend directly from the keepkey's extension in Chrome.  You can also use MultibitHD to control it.  If you have and android phone there is a way to use the keepkey's with Mycelium.  I would just keep Coin you want to hold long term in there and keep a small amount in a wallet app on your phone.  I keep about 300 in my phone and the rest in the keep key.  Just really depends on how you want to do it.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:02:52
So I was reading that the setup with Bitgo was a response to the CFTC's action on Bitfinex.  I can't remember where I think it was on Reddit.  It also said that the use of BitGo in the way they set it up was the best way to meet the requirements set forth by the CFTC.  
So is this an example of a govt body trying to regulate Bitcoin and that going to shit because you can't really regulate Bitcoin?
 
Edit: 
Or is this just messed up implementation?

Well said.  I really don't see myself as a libertarian.  I just found myself intrigued by the network, technology, and possibility.  I'm just glad I'm ground in reality and realism.

@_date: 2016-06-10 23:16:36
I'd agree for a small amount in terms of USD.  If it's larger I'd get a hardware wallet like a keepkey (which I use) or a trezor. I mean be realistic in terms of what you use.  If it's not worth the cost ($99) for either, consider paper wallets...locked up in a fire/waterproof safe or safe deposit box.  
I generally follow the rule "if you don't hold the keys you don't have Bitcoin".  
@_date: 2016-06-18 22:25:37

@_date: 2016-06-29 21:23:18
just listened to this.  I've never had a transaction take more than 30 mins to get 1 confirmation.  They are completely clueless...they must have not sent a fee or one so small they got ignored.  i just use whatever pops up in my wallet (copay).  Whole thing sounds like a big block pump. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 00:45:52

That sucks.  
Regions is ok apparently with it.  They have lots of business accounts in Austin which apparently is a Bitcoin haven.  
I'm not surprised though.  Iberia bank is full of Hibernia National Bank executives who are overtly conservative with their practices.  
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:32:46
Depends on which one you use.  They have two options.  A multi sig where you hold the keys and one where they do.  The problem with them holding the keys is that it basically isn't your Bitcoin.  I use a KeepKey and I have a few paper wallets.  All stay locked up in a fire and water resistant safe.  I keep about $50-100 USD in Coinbase for when I may use someone who uses them and for my shift card.   However I'm looking for other options.  If we had more BTM's and Bitcoin businesses here near New Orleans I would just keep it all off Coinbase.  
Remember if you don't hold your private keys you don't own your Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 23:21:15
Will be interesting to see if more pop up here (in NOLA).

No your private keys are in the wallet file.  The coins are in the blockchain but assigned to your private key.  What kind of issues are you having? What wallet? What is it on? (Smartphone/computer/hardware wallet)
@_date: 2016-06-07 23:23:11
Dude, have you called your bank?  They may be able to see pending incoming transactions stuck in their ACH warehouse? I've been finding in general my ACH deposits and withdrawals for everything have been taking a lot longer.  Not defending Coinbase, I really don't use them much anymore.  Except for a few buys here and there.  Just depends on how bad and how quickly you need the money.  If its generally a "i need it now!" thing. You could always have gotten a Shift card, or a Bitpay Card.  then you could either spend the funds in fiat or make an ATM withdrawal. using the pin (of course there are fees attached.)  Just remember options are out there, although they sometimes suck or have fees attached. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 23:33:00
Well that's totally true.  Maybe BitGo.   I dunno I've read enough horror stories about keeping money with exchanges to rule out coinbase or circle.  Just all depends on the amount.

@_date: 2016-06-21 19:07:33
This doesn't sound like the need a blockchain. They just need a database.  How are they gonna tell bar of gold from the other? Serial numbers? You could just melt it to remove the serial numbers.   Doesn't seem to make much sense.  
@_date: 2016-06-06 07:27:35
I honestly don't think we will see much difference except checking and savings will be an option at a bank like at coinbase.  They hold the keys.  Unless you decide to hold your own savings.  Then banks will handle lending.  Mostly.  P2p will be around but returns and rates suck on those anyway.  I doubt banking becomes a barren wasteland of no institutions.  It will just change and adapt. Those who don't will prob go under.  We have time for this.  It's not gonna happen fast.  They are still in denial this is working, however slowly. 
I don't really think we have any idea yet what people will even do with smart contracts.  I've heard some things like music drm and laughed.  No one has apparently ever dubbed a song off the radio to a cassette player before.

If I've learned one thing in Bitcoin, it is to expect the unexpected and hold on to your stomach.  If you cannot tolerate the risk then don't buy.  Secondly, its not an investment.  This is beyond risky.  For the moment bitcoin is a grand social-computer science-economic-psychology experiment. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay but they may be only in their toddler years and that's a stretch.  People have only gone to it right now because the current system has gone to such shit in most of the world that it just seems like a better risk.  Take it slow.  Lets see where this ends up.  
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:12:17
Let's put everything on the blockchain! Water on the blockchain, bread on the blockchain, mattress covers on the blockchain, blockchain on the blockchain.  
This is just getting ridiculous.  Maybe everyone should take a step back from this and give it a fresh look.  It just seems like it's good for one thing.  Transfer of value and immutable records.  That's it.  
@_date: 2016-06-08 04:35:58
Ok so here is where I see it.  You got hacked.  I looked through my wallet settings on blockchain.info.  There is a setting to blacklist or whitelist ip addresses in the advanced settings.  I think your machine got hacked.  The got your password, got in, changed it, and blocked your IP.  if they even changed the email address it explains why they won't talk to you.  To them you aren't a wallet holder.  
I hope you didn't have a lot.   Keep out of that wallet on your computer.  Keep it on a secure mobile device and paper or hardware wallets.  
If you are running Windows you were screwed from the moment you signed up.  I have a Mac, with encryption turned on,and keep my long term stuff on a keep key and paper wallets.  Stuff I may use in small amounts stays on my iPhone.  
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:14:35
That seems odd.  Although Simple really isn't a bank.  Last i checked they were a payment services company that contracted with US Bank to process transactions.  Basically a prepaid card company.

So how does BSave make money?? I went to your site, there is no information there about who BSave is as a company.  No location, mission statement, corporate information, nothing.  If you are a savings account that pays interest, you must practice some sort of lending.  If you lend then you must be practicing fractional reserve banking. If not how are you getting the positive revenue to pay interest on the BTC you are getting from people.  
**  I do see where it says you loan out the bitcoin, so you are lending.  I do not see where someone signs up or applies for a loan.  Can you tell us who this process works.  What are your lending criteria?  What safe guards do you use to protect someones investment?

@_date: 2016-06-20 00:44:10
before you get a bunch of stuff bashing coin base i'll try to make it simple.  with bitcoin you should know by now that you need your private key to send and control the coins allocated to you in the blockchain.  with coin base they hold your keys.  we know they say they are insured but do you really want to deal with that whole process incase something bad happens.  granted some people don't feel responsible enough to protect their keys.  I get that.  However you need to know that during the mt gox mess people lost everything or large parts because their coins and keys were not in their possession.  some cold storage options like keep key you have your seed but the private key is never disclosed.  thats ok in that case because the device is in your hands. you control it.  its more about being secure in knowing you are in control of your money.  personally i used coinbase unit i realized this then i got a keep key and signed up for a regular app wallet like copay.  I use it for my immediate funds and the bulk is on the keep key.  sorry for bad formatting but my web browser is being a bitch right now.  if anyone else wants to chime in i think i got most of it.  lets just keep the coin base bashing to a minimum, it doesn't really help.

Well remember the UK doesn't use the Euro as a primary currency.   They accept it. They also accept $$ so it's prob not going to have a huge impact initially.  Now the question becomes.... Will this cause issues with the rest of the EU.  If the EU stays strong and steady then nothing.  If it slowly falls apart, as countries begin to shift back to their old national fiat then it will create uncertainty.  Then it all depends on the public.  Would they accept a risky online currency or a risky reestablishing national fiat currency.  Just depends on the vote.   Lots of uncertainty. 
Uncertainty is good for gold and apparently Bitcoin.

It puts a strain on developers and why make an app if you aren't going to to get the best distribution for it.

The sender pays the fee.  the wallet would set it up in the transaction before you press send.  Go back and look at the transaction in the outgoing wallet.

If I had a yard or a house I'd give ya a shot.  If anyone asks I'll pass the word.  
@_date: 2016-05-26 06:15:39
Good luck!
@_date: 2016-05-29 02:22:03
Ok never mind. I got lost in your chain of events.  I missed the part where the fee came out of electrum.  that is crazy.  What kind of computer is it on?

Holding.  Dollar cost averaging in to level off the volatility.  Most of the time it sits in my keep key. I keep a little in Coinbase linked to my shift card as mad money. 
Been looking for places around town here in the Greater New Orleans area that accept it.  Being such a tourist area I'm sure it would help them.

If they were to stop mining and cease a revenue stream I'm sure the bankruptcy court wouldn't be too happy with them.  Some revenue is better than none.

I'm only seeing $520.  1-2% decline after such a steep rise isn't bad.  Volume is extremely light.   A crash would have high volume and the  mempool would be huge right now.  Chill out. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 03:11:53
I'm sure it's worse with the overall size of the country.  They can't be everywhere all the time.  Plus the fact that they are mining wealth Into China I'm sure the govt turns a blind eye. With a small bribe of course.

Yeah.  I just use it to buy. This is kinda crazy.

I just downloaded the iOS version. It seems there is no security options.  No spending password, no passcode.  No Touch ID.   I don't know if I can trust this with my coin. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 15:55:24
I don't either, it just kinda fit imho. Yay, something new, its making money, let me get in too kinda thing. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:01:43
I just saw. The excess vaults have been deleted.

I management customer service people for 8 years.  It's not just dumping money at the problem.  It takes building a culture of service.  If you don't have that you don't have a genuine customer service organization. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:08:45
Yeah.  I'm on page three now and 28
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:56:22
Up to 37 now.  Now if they could duplicate my bitcoin id be happy with it.

I've been using copay up until I tried the iOS 10 public beta.  It crapped out on that.  They are working on fixing that.  All and all though I love it.  Simple to use, clean interface, and it has the coinbase integration if you want to use that.  
@_date: 2016-07-12 23:28:25
Copay and Jaxx do sweeping. It's just in a menu. Wallet setting/advanced on copay and tool / transfer paper wallet on Jaxx 
@_date: 2016-07-31 05:11:37
Just dollar cost average.

Stability can be a good thing.  For the time being anyway.  It will go up again when it's time for it to go up.  When there are more buyers than sellers.  
@_date: 2016-07-02 20:19:20
lord this topic has been beat to death.  this had scam all over it.  when i was just getting into bitcoin i bought into but something didnt sit right with me.  there was no way to see they were doing what they said they would be doing.  luckily they said they would refund you if you weren't satisfied so i pulled out and ran.  
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:36:45
That's true.  Just dumping money at a problem does nothing without a worthwhile plan 
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:44:04
Nice attempt at a pump but follow your own logic.  Armageddon prob means no power.  No power means no miners or Internet.  No miners mean no energy invested into the block chain.  No transactions being mined.  No power also means no way to run nodes.  No power to charge mobile devices.  No wireless networks.  You could do peer to peer ad hoc connections but no one to add them to the blockchain.   At that point your better off just kidding your ass goodbye.  
@_date: 2016-07-31 04:24:23
No option to even turn it on

I think what everyone is trying to say is that miners tend to sell their Bitcoin anyway.  They use fiat to pay for their operations.  They don't really HODL it.   Generally as soon as it's mined it's sold.  They have bills like power, rent, payroll, personal bills, etc.  they can't just sit on the Bitcoin they mine. 
They won't flood the market because they aren't holding a ton of it to begin with.  Now instead of 25 per block they will sell the 12.5 per block.  So it will be less that is introduced into the market.  As the system was built for.  
Your hypothesis is based on miners holding on to Bitcoin.  They may have some saved and they may sell that but I doubt they will dump it all. The they will drop some over time to fill I the gaps in their accounting.  
The question on price now is how much of the halvening is built in to the current price and how will this talk of EU regulation effect the price.  
If they can't survive they will sell off their equipment most likely or shut down.  I think it will be interesting to see what happens to the Hashrate.

I haven't looked yet, have they updated the GUI for the android wallet? I have a Blackberry DTEK on order to try for work.

Just listened to this interview.  It was great! 
@_date: 2016-07-20 19:52:26
They prob shouldn't adopt it until its easier to use.  Remember the average American operates not the equivalent of a 3rd to 4th grade education, at least as of a few years ago.  The current bitcoin wallets are shit for ease of use.  I tired to explain it to my 56 yo mother and her best friend.  Both are somewhat computer savvy and they were lost.  I literally had to pull out a piece of paper and draw diagrams.  They got it then.  Those of us here get it because we are natural early adopters or we came here looking for this to succeed.  Most people are totally clueless...  The masses will come to bitcoin when it and they are ready.  Hype isn't the reason.  
@_date: 2016-07-09 00:28:27

Kinda sounds like the propaganda you want to put out to legitimize things.  Espically down play thos "unreal transactions"

well that's a good one, i'll have to use it sometime.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:21:47
copay.  the multisig is nice to have as an option.  Even if you don't use it right away.  
@_date: 2016-05-29 02:55:54
Ah ok.  I was thinking it happened during the initial transfer off of Coinbase.  Not that familiar with Linux.  Wanted to make sure you weren't on Windows.   Keep an eye on your wallet.  If you see anything like that I would yank my balance off there.  I use a KeepKey for my longer term storage and generally just use my phone.  
What's the deal with Linux and malware?
