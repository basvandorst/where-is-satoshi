I bought in around a dollar to buy a PC game that was only available with Bitcoin. I remember being pissed off about the extra steps required to buy the game. I know it's not what you are looking for, but BTC was inconsequential  (if not down right annoying) when it was that low.

Humor is about context.

Setup was easy, you just need to set up the online marketplace and check the shipping button on each item that you want to be available. Like I said though, you can only do it with shipping. So, technically it's not perfect. It just sends an email to the customer with a code to send from their wallet and then converts to fiat. Quite a few hoops, but I'm willing to do it to spread the viability of BTC for everyday use.

It's a fee to me, not my customer.

I would try altcoin mining. You would get a similar experience setting up your miner, and you might see a successful hash every now and then. It's really fun setting up miners, even if you don't get any reward. So, I see where you are coming from. I don't want to break the subreddit's rules, but I google'd alt coins that use cpu mining and got many results. 
If you want a hobby, you want fun. I just don't think you would find any fun mining Bitcoins on a CPU.

I learned about bitcoin because people would always say: "you're smart, how do bitcoins work?" I have always been poor so I have never bought bitcoin. I mined some litecoin in like 2015 and traded them for bitcoin and then lost most of my coin on an exchange. Nothing really changed in my life. I almost got a job at coinbase a few years back. That could have changed my life at the time.

Crowd funding each tool *maybe* lol. You cant produce a finished product with one of each, you need dozens (at least) of different etch, dep and photo lithography tools. I work for a company that makes phone signal filters. It takes us nearly one hundred steps, and 30 days, to produce a single lot of wafers (which is the form of choice for ASIC production). Each step can use multiple million dollar tools. I assume creating a crypto ASIC would be even harder than a frequency filter.

I interviewed with them for a customer service job. I'm so glad I failed their test. It sounds like it would be an awful job.

You can't sell an open source integrated circuit unless your customers have access to million dollar etch, dep and photo lithography tools. 
Your example has little to do with open source, that's just cooperation between companies.

I was thinking that it would be awful due to the way people respond to the issues that they are having. As far as customer service goes, it's a lot easier when your customers are stupid. It's very hard to find solutions to problems when the customer spends most of their time trying to catch you in a mistake.

It was all fairly standard, I was just unprepared for the level of specificity. Of the questions that I remember, the hardest was something along the lines of: which of these addresses are multisig? Then it listed 4 options. I remember thinking, holy shit you can identify that from just a wallet address?  I know people want to make them the bad guy, but in this instance it was just the fact that I was unqualified.

Me too lol.

No, but thank you for pointing out my mistake. I was pretty tired.
