Speaking of Portland, do we have a user group? I've been looking to join up. 
Not sure if the thing at Madison's Grill is still going. 
I dont need a VPS, but just throwing some ideas out there. I'd like to see 2 orgs setup here in PDX.   
One to promote BTC to pdx cart owners. Seriously, this needs to happen. 
The other to promote free Creative Commons Artists to 'sell' their works via a BTC donation. Something like shopify but easier and free.

I think about doing this everyday. 
I'm down here in Portland if you need any help.  Drop me a PM.

Have to admit it was one of the neatest things to send my wife flowers on mothers day via bitcoin. And then tell her after how I did it. 
Just one more positive thing for us bitcoiners.

yep there is a brat cart downtown that only accepts cash and I never carry it.  Always end up getting something else.

OH! I like that portable QR code laminator idea!

Trying this out. Can I create a color coin for my school and then buy and sell student art via color coins? Just one of the many questions I have about them. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 03:21:33
this is exactly what I was thinking while reading ... and it is also one of the coolest things in those books.  Now that part may becoming a reality?!

I have nothing to do with SomaFM, just a listener since ~2000. I emailed them and they set it up. Over the last year they received over 2 BTC! 
Highly recommend the station Xmas in Frisko for you holiday cheers.

I've been looking forward to this since you announced netvend. Does the SQL db run on your server or mine? 
Can you draw up a little workflow of a higher level process.  Like let's say I create my own coinflow but want it to look and act like twitter. Can you go through how my app would interact with the netvend back end and maybe even the blockchain. 
The more we talk out loud the more understanding will occur. 
Lastly, could a generic reddit be made with netvend/coinflow?? I'd love to see a better news app

Thanks!  I am trying to figure out now what I want to build with this.  I'll send some back when I do.

thank you

tipping to pay it forward in the hopes that more people will join in

Fundamentally all commodities are being hammered (manipulated?) Down. Eventually we will move past this phase. 
We are sitting better than we were infrastructure wise and adoption rate. 
I see no reason to abandon ship when the technology is far superior to anything related. 
And 
Openbazaar is coming soon. 
Also, IMA long term holder.

Wonder if getting the charities to get on reddit and get a change tip account so we can pay it forward easier. 
That being said I got a 100bit tip last week and want to push it to a good cancer non profit (IMA survivor), 
Anyone know if the cancer nonprofit organizations here are on reddit?

Lol. Thanks. Just checked the user profile. Whoops. Troll fed, dang it. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:26:49
Awesome!  Thank you devs! You guys rock

I was coming back from visiting my son in my Miami and I stopped at a rest stop to use the bathroom. I just sat down on the toilet when I heard a voice coming from the stall next to mine, “Hey! How’s it going?” Although I was quite surprised, and I wasn’t in the habit of conversing to the people next to me in the stall, I nevertheless answered him, “I’m fine” I said “thanks for asking.”
“What are you doing?” Asked the same voice. To be honest I was a bit taken aback by the brazenness of this fellow, but I would never ignore anyone so I calmly answered, “I’m releaving myself.”
Then I heard the same voice again, “I’m going to have to call you back, some smart-aleck is answering all of my questions.”

Thanks! To the tipperTubes!

I found that tipping on G+ is worth while. Expose new people to the world of bitcoin one doughnut at a time
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:25:56
Was able to give some to family and friends via g+ and twitter, I love how changetip is here and the other social nets all linked. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 19:36:49
great! thanks

This is awesome. Thanks. 
Would he be willing to do 1 gallon kits on the shopify site? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:36:55
Wow. That was fast!!
