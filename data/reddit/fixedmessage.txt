In economic sciences „long term“ usually means 10 years or more. Bitcoin already passed 11 years. So it has already survived „long term“.

I can tell you what happened at the last halving: The price went sideways and dropped a little later. The bull market fun began a few months after the halving. 
So, it could still be a long time until we see the next the bull market.

This is news to me. When I asked them a few weeks ago, they told me that you only get software updates while your subscription is active. 
After your subscription expires you can still download the software that was released during the time the subscription was active, but you will not receive updates that are released after your subscription expires.
That is what they told me.

Did you even read the page you linked?

your website could also be a little clearer on this topic, because you list "constant software updates" as a benefit of the subscription. 
I get that you are trying to push the subscription because you prefer a regular income but being this vague about a topic that is clearly important for potential buyers doesn't benefit your business.
I was on the fence of buying your product multiple times in the last year but held off, because I had a hard time finding definite and reliable information on your update policy.

Understanding the lighting network requires a lot of reading. In the most basic terms it is a transaction network between multiple parties. The Bitcoin Blockchain is used as a settlement layer where the result is stored, once you are done with transactions on the lightning network.
The threat with china (in my opinion) is not that they destroy bitcoin but that they start to censor transactions. Since they have more than 51% of all mining power in their country they could require the miners to exclude specific transactions for political reasons.
On the other hand, one could imagine that Bitcoin nodes choose to ignore the blocks of chinese miners, which would effectively be a hardfork that creates 2 chains.
But yeah, its a problem.
