So wrong. The alts have always followed bitcoin, since the very first one. The entire space watches bitcoin, bitcoin moves and people freak out about alts as well.

This crash started a long time before bitconnect went down. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:00:22
There was a Google engineer who posted on twitter about his experience trying to cash out some bitcoin.
It was long, tedious, slow, and frustrating. I would read his experience before continuing down your chosen path.

No worries sorry to be rude I was just confused. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:15:09
I hope you are right. But as segwit2x stands to make miners a lot more money in the long run due to being able to process more transactions and collect more transaction fees, I'm not as optimistic as you. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:19:24
I think that's a good call. Anyone paying attention knew that the run to 7800 is/was a bubble. It may go up a lot more before popping, but it's a bubble, and bubble's decay symmetrically. Wait long enough and $1000 dollar coins will again be available before the next (larger) bubble. Lots of cash to be made!

That does not mean it was not a bubble *at that time*.
There was a housing bubble too. Houses still have value. Still a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:06:14
You mean while people can't sell their coins, and keep trying to sell them for a lower price to try and get the damn things to sell? Meanwhile the fees shoot through the roof for the same reason? Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away, but it does seem to be this community's main strategy. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:08:29
Benefits of not having skin in the game. When it goes up I live the excitement, when it goes down I enjoy the schadenfreude. Might try it yourself if things are too stressful. Sometimes it's best to take out your investment and have a breather. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:43:26
That seems reasonable. So then to repeat the calculations, when the split happens it will be:
33 minutes per block until difficulty adjusts.
1 transaction per second until difficulty adjusts.
And since the fork block is 864 blocks away from the next difficulty adjustment, it will take ~20 days for the adjustment to occur.
So, if the main chain can survive severely reduced transaction speed for 20 days without severely losing price which causes a run to the chain which is now running well over 6 transactions per second, then the main chain will remain the dominant cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:09:57
Yeah I expected Chinese holders to wake up and panic and for about an hour I seemed to be right and was having a good time. Then slight recovery and nothing. So lame. Maybe I'm just annoyed I miscalled it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:17:10
And? The result of that is S2X gets 84% of the hashpower and merrily chugs along, offering faster transactions per second, lower fees, and more network security. In the meantime bitcoin transactions are essentially stranded, taking way longer to complete until enough blocks are solved to trigger a difficulty readjustment. In the average case it will take 46 days for this readjustment to occur, and in that time transactions will be 6 times slower, further driving a run away from standard bitcoin.
And if you think most users are as proud and steady as some of the userbase in this subreddit, you've got another thing coming. 
So tell me what the core devs will do about this?
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:08:32
But if they get 84% of the hashrate, what could cause it to fail? As with all other forks it will start with a price similar to the original chain coins. If it's got most of the hashrate, why wouldn't people switch?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:05:15
Or someone is trying to sell a load of coins, but they know if they sell all at once they tank the price and lose out of profits. So they are selling in batches of 200 to stay off of radar, just below market price to sell quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:28:56
So are we all just ignoring that they are still carrying 84% of the network hash rate?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:59:57
That's true to an extent because rather than being based on time, difficulty readjustment schedule is actually based on number of blocks. Higher difficulty + less miners = slower transactions. However, increasing the number of miners will only ever get transactions back up to the theoretical maximum, since having a lot of miners will mean that difficulty readjustments occur quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:30:45
It WAS a bubble at 1000. Then it popped, and everyone who got out of the bubble and got back in after the pop won big. You savvy?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:18:18
I watch via gdax and have noticed that. What are your thoughts on why the market is managing to hold onto the 5900 range in spite of that pressure?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:29:07
China is waking up... if you're gonna jump ship now is the time. Otherwise prepare for a long bear market.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:03:35
Are you kidding? bcash never even had close to 84%. When the split happened it had 1400 PH/s vs Bitcoin's 6300 PH/s. That's 22%, and leads me to believe you have no idea what you are talking about. If bitcoin cash had secured 85%, there is virtually no doubt it would be the main chain. That is what is coming on November 16th. Segwit2x will gain the majority of the hashrate and will almost certainly hold onto it. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:31:10
Right, but *after* the current bubble pops would be a much better time, correct?
If you bought Amazon after the com bubble popped, your returns were MUCH greater than buying amazon at the top of the bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:25:43
Odd. Yeah it's strange to me that price hasn't broken down a lot further, a lot of people who bought in the last month are out money and there must be a lot of downward pressure. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:16:50
Yeah I want to see that! But my girlfriend wants to see it with me and she's working so I gotta wait for now. Heard from a lot of people that it's great though.

Do you even hear yourself? 


What is this, a religion? If you consider making money some way other than holding onto all your coins then you aren't a true believer in Saint Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:20:33
Not that I've found, unfortunately. The numbers I've given are based on my own calculations and data about segwit2x consensus from [coin dance](
Really though, if you do research to understand hashrate and what it is used for on the network, difficulty and how that is calculated by the bitcoin algorithm and how that maintains time between blocks, consensus, and the difference between soft forks and hard forks, you should be able to perform the calculations yourself. Also, [here is an earlier post I made where an example calculation is given](

A hard fork is not backwards compatible. In other words, with a soft fork, the forked chain transactions are seen as valid by nodes running the old code. So a soft fork is pretty "easy" in that nodes wishing to run the old code still see the transactions made with the new code as valid, and chains wishing to upgrade still create transactions that are verifiable with the old code. 
A hard fork creates a change in the code that makes the new transactions incompatible with the old ones to all nodes. It is a much bigger deal and requires a high level of consensus to keep the new chain going strong.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:42:25
Everyone who realizes that this fork is going through with 85% of the hash rate doesn't know what to do. Everyone who doesn't understand posts total B.S.

Way to not respond to any *actual information*. I have no intention of running or using segwit2x. I'm just pointing out that it is a problem, and ignoring it does not help. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:05:36
You do understand that without hash power the network becomes far less secure, as current server farms and mining pools have enough processing ability to significantly alter low hash rate networks? Further, if there is a sudden drop in hash rate then the current difficulty will make it exceedingly hard for say, 15% of the hash rate to mine new blocks. In fact, as a rough estimate if 85% of the current hash rate stops mining on the current blockchain, then it will take:
let b = number of blocks since last difficulty adjustment
Time until next difficulty adjustment: 10 minutes * (2016 - b) * (100/15)
Average block time until adjustment = (100/15) * 10 minutes
Transactions per second until adjustment(Assume current rate of ~4.5/sec) = 4.5 * (100/15)
In the average case, for 1008 blocks, each taking 66 minutes, it will take 46 days for the network to adjust difficulty. During this time, the transaction rate will be reduced by a divisor of 6. 
Any way you want to spin it, this is a big problem. Calling it "fool's gold" does not aid in getting over the technological hurdle. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:32:23
...and 85% of the network hash power

Sure go for it. Don't do it right now though, we are likely in the midst of a bubble. Wait for it to pop, then buy in.

You are reading it right. And whoever made the chart portrays segwit as a hard fork. Ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:32:24
Aww, you beat me to it :(.
But seriously, I'm really excited about this project. This goes beyond bitcoin into extremely exciting territory for digital privacy and small scale digital organization. Right now it appears the technology depends on certain nodes in the network being connected to a traditional ISP in order to sell service to the rest of the network. Already, this is a huge increase in privacy for the end user, since ISPs can't see past the entry-point node into the rest of the network(I'm assuming they can't, or at the very least that this can be implemented). 
But this ability to use micro-transactions to sell bandwidth also allows and incentivizes the creation of small nodal networks, completely disconnected from traditional ISPs. Node networks are an old idea, but until now they have only been motivated by idealogical concerns. Now their creation can be motivated by profit.

To be fair, the authors of that code hadn't even publicly announced it.  Someone just decided to dig it up. And it states on the repo they are moving to a C/C++ implementation anyway, which is way more appropriate for this kind of project and gives some indication they know what they are doing. Also, the fact that they already have funding speaks volumes. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 06:36:40
Why would they? The only reasons to have bitcoin or cryptos are if 
a. You're ideologically driven (libertarian, ancap)
or 
b. You're a criminal
For regular people who think *government* is probably a good idea... why would you ever want bitcoin?
