I agree.   Look at a long-term chart of bitcoin, plotted logarithmically.  2017 is starting to look a lot like 2013.  We don't need a huge  run-up to $100,000 in 2018, followed by a huge crash or bear market (like in 2014.) 
We'll get to $100,000, but this should take several years to be healthy.
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:51:02
Could be, but there's an even older support line, going back to 2011.  Its the support line bitcoin was riding in 2014.   If Bitcoin waits for that line to catch up, we'll go sideways all year, and not rally until 2019.
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:21:40
I agree.   Don't know why I would get downvoted for pointing out the older support line exists.  Arguably, it would be healthier to correct back to the older support line, as that would set up another monster rally next year.

The best advice is to make a set of rules for yourself that tell you when to buy or sell.  Then follow the rules instead of your emotions.  Dollar-cost averaging is an example of a good "system" (rule set.)
Emotions in investing will always lead you to the wrong actions.

The $200 target is what I remember from 2013-14, from discussions here on Reddit.  Doubt I could find it now.  But if you draw the support line and intersect it with the price trend at the time, you can see how the prediction was made.
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:49:08
Well, what I look at is Bitcoin's long-term support line (a line drawn connecting most of Bitcoin's lowest points going back to 2011.  I use an exponential plot.)
It's not easy to do this with a perfectly straight line, but a very slightly curved one fits very well (makes sense if we are on an adoption curve.) 
The 2013 rally took Bitcoin's price to a place very far above this support line.  And the 2-year bear market took the price back to that line.  The bear market lasted so long because of the substantial distance the price had to travel to get back to the support line.
Right now, we are not nearly as far away from that support line.  If the bear market continued, we would either start a new downward trend down to that support line at around $4000-$5000, or just continue sideways until the long-term support line caught up with us.  In either case, we would end up 2018 in about the same place we already are, $6000 to $9000.  And we'd be set up to climb back out next year, maybe hitting a new high near the end of 2019 (and then a new wild rally in 2020.)
None of this precludes the possibility of a brand new rally starting soon.  But that would set up an even worse bear market down the road.  
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:15:36
Of course "curve fitting" can be abused.  But people used this same support line to predict a $200 landing point for the fall from the 2013 highs.  It was pretty close.  
There are no guaranteed ways to know the future. But that doesn't mean we have no useful tools at all.

I went through a situation before I owned bitcoin where I had a bit of money.  I believe the money was one of the things that led to her having affairs and then pushing for a divorce (the ex wife realizing she could afford to be on her own with my money.)   
The Bitcoin money is a different thing, though - it's not so easy to grab and run away with.  I would have a hard time NOT telling her (to see her reaction.)  However, don't ever put anything in writing about how much you have (or put a completely different amount in your written records).  You could always claim she misunderstood you if the worst happened with your relationship.  And be VERY careful about where you store your BTC - if you have paper wallets or a hardware wallet, come up  with a really, really good hiding place.  Tell a VERY trusted friend where it is, if the worst happens to you.
Regarding possible life changes, wait until BTC gets to $10,000 and stays above it.  It's not that far away, and you'll have an even $2 million.  You can easily pull a safe 3-4% income (about $70,000 / year) from that for an early retirement.  Or keep your job and take any amount less than that for your other needs, while most of the money keeps growing.
Buying a house (or anything else) in cash is not financially sound if the mortgage or loan rate is lower than your investment returns.  Paying 5% mortgage interest makes more sense than losing the 100% gains you get from your crypto investment.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:12:25
My observation is just that the shape of the GBTC chart after the fork looks like the shape of the BCH chart.  It was flat rather than going up, like Bitcoin was.  
If the fund holds Bitcoin, it should mimic the shape of the Bitcoin chart.

It's a pretty desperate and irrational charge.  r/bitcoin has five times the subscriber base  of r/btc.  Pulling the crazy cord makes no sense for r/bitcoin.  
If you think "suspicious coincidences" warrant the suspension of disbelief to this level, go ahead.  But I could mine comment histories to find "suspicious coincidences" too.  It's easy to do with so much raw material to work with.
I prefer the more obvious coincidences myself.  Accounts stolen and vote-botting all in favor of r/btc's interests.  The over-the-top nature of the attack was an error, that's all.  The wrong people got paid to pull this off.

Be careful about believing in something simply for the sake of your own agenda.    
If the r/btc community were smart, they would encourage this story to quietly die, instead of circulating a crazy false-flag conspiracy theory that very few people will buy. 
Looking for, and finding new information that proves who did this won't help you either.  Think about how complicated your conspiracy theory will have to become to explain those future facts away.

Long-term capital gains is taxed at a better rate.  Try to stay invested for a  while.
Federal capital gains rate is actually zero, if your income is low enough.
A good strategy to get money out is to vary your withdrawals in alternate years - keep your withdrawals low enough to get the zero rate one year, then take more out the following year, and pay tax on it.  If you do this right, you'll reduce your average effective tax rate.

2013 for me, also.   I followed Bitcoin here on Reddit from 2010, but not seriously - I assumed it would get stomped on by banks or government any day now.  
By 2013, I finally decided that wouldn't happen anytime soon.  I made a small investmemt on the way up, some more on the way down.  My total investment was perhaps 3% of my savings.
Today my BTC comprises the majority of my savings, just from that initial investment.

That's the only part of your comment I can't agree with.  
The most obvious answer is usually what turns out to be true in the end.  A false flag is pretty far out there in conspiracy territory, especially in this case with such a poor motivation for r/bitcoin doing this to themselves.

Trusting an exchange like Coinbase might be the fastest and easiest way to get the split coins.  But there's also a risk, since your account will be frozen for a while around the fork.  Then you have to trust the exchange to do what they promised.
Some wallets (Electrum, Trezor, Ledger) have indicated they will make it possible to split coins, but details of exactly how or when this will happen are sketchy.  
Coinomi hasn't made an official announcement about 2X support in their wallet, but their Reddit spokesperson has made several comments: 
"...Work in progress. Stay tuned."
"...2X has no replay protection, a mixing service is required to protect your coins. We're working on it, more info soon."
"...we have something nice for all of you in store, concerning this fork. Stay tuned :)"

i second this opinion.  BTC is at the bottom of a bear market right now, the most likely direction over the next two years is UP.  If I were to hazard a guess, the next big bull market is maybe a year away.   Sell at the top, not at a bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:12:50
If you move the red line just a little higher, you can see it's the support line for the 2017 rally (a line that connects the lowest prices since the rally started.)  McAfee's prediction is based on the 2017 trend continuing.  
A line connecting the highest points on the chart is the resistance line.  The support and resistance lines are converging, roughly at the end of March.  We'll know which way Bitcoin is going when we break out of this pattern.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:35:39
I can't give you a foolproof entry point - getting in anyplace when it was under 8000 would have been great. But that's assuming the rally will restart soon.
If you want a less risky entry, wait until the end of March or early April, when Bitcoin should finally break out of this indecisive pattern and choose a direction (up or down) and stick with it.  If the price breaks above 10000 after that time, I think it's much more likely to keep rising.
If it goes under 8000 again after the end of March, I think we may be heading down to Bitcoin's older support line from 2015-16.   Assuming a mostly gradual trend down (like 2014) instead of a sudden huge crash, that lower price level could be $4000-$5000 by mid-year.  That would be a great entry point as well, as even that worst-case support line should bring us back to near $10000 by years' end.  
So, even in the worst case, Bitcoin ends the year pretty much where the year started.  Then we're  set up for another great rally in 2019.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:00:22
Thanks, excellent advice.  Use an exponential chart:
Draw a straight line underneath connecting the lowest points, this is the support line that is likely never to be crossed (not for a long time, anyway.)
Anybody who worries about Bitcoin's price should learn a little about how charting works (instead of downvoting anyone trying to explain it.)
Oh, and you want a simple system for trading in and out?  Look at the moving average on that chart above. Sell when price crosses the line going down.  Buy when it crosses again going up.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:08:08
Best way to evaluate the "danger level" is to look at a long term exponential chart, like this one:
If you draw a line (or hold a ruler) connecting the lowest points on the chart, that's Bitcoin's long-term support line.   It's very unlikely the Bitcoin price will go below that line.  
Look how far away the price got away from that support line in 2013.  That's what made it dangerous - the 2014 bear market took the price all the way back down, and it was a long way, so it took quite a while.
Look at the same situation today.  The biggest risk, going all the way down to that line - assuming we got there on a gradual slope (like 2014) instead of a sudden crash - would probably take us to $4000 - $5000.   But even at that level, Bitcoin's lowest support line should take the price back near $10,000 by the end of the year.
So worst case, we end the year where we started the year, and have our next big rally in 2019.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:32:06
I upvoted you because I also made a prediction it would get to the 7500 range and reverse.  
I got downvoted as well.  People here don't care much for basic charting analysis, apparently.
The pennant formation we're in suggests Bitcoin will make up its mind (either up or lots further down) around the end of this month or very early April.  It will bounce between 8000-10000 until it does.

Which means that whoever controls those coins could use them to defend Bitcoin by selling S2X, or any other attacking fork.

Well, he could certainly cash out his BCH.
In fact, couldn't such a huge hoard of coins be used to defend BTC, by selling coins from hostile forks like S2X?  There are more than enough coins to utterly destroy the market value of an attacking chain, while bolstering BTC's valuation by buying more.
Is it possible that a contingency plan like this exists for a worst-case scenario?

All you are doing is confusing the issue of who is stealing my money - the person doing the replay exploit, or the people who created the vulnerability.  Of course none of this does not make your point true.  I have not "assigned" my money to a thief.


Again, this notion from you that the people who decided to mess with my coins and the people who might steal my money have ZERO responsibility.  THEFT IS NOT MORAL.  Thieves and fraudsters have responsibilities, too.  I can't believe I even have TO SAY THIS.


Unbelievable.  Try reading the comment thread.


NOT TO STEAL OR ENABLE THEFT.  


Try picking up a history book.  Or any religious book.


Unbelievable.   How about the thieves themselves?  


Right and wrong has historical, religious, and philosophical roots.  Every culture on earth recognizes theft as a moral wrong.


I have responded to this already.  I have a responsibility to lock my door.  Failing to do this, however, does not make theft legal or moral.

That's not the same issue as pretending that bad actors HAVE no moral or ethical responsibilities.  And Bitcoin is far more than a "game".  Actual "games" don't have real-world consequences.  
You are excusing them from responsibility for their actions, simply because the system has no legal repercussions to deal them.

Basic charting doesn't tell you everything that's going to happen. It's about probabilities, price ranges, stuff like that.  
It's a lot like being a good poker player.  You don't know what's going to happen, but you can get good at playing the odds when they're in your favor.
I'm not a trader.  But I try to protect myself against the largest swings.  Example - look at this chart:
I traded out when the price crossed the moving average in 2014. And got back in when it crossed the other way in 2015.
The reason Bitcoiners should learn basic charting is just to reduce stress levels. It feels MUCH better to have some idea what's going on, instead of just being jerked around by wild price swings and doomsday press articles.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:55:28


Protecting them from who?  Thieves?  Who are the thieves in this scenario?
Of course, they're the people behind the fork you are defending.


Well, in this case it's pretty darn easy to figure that out.
I agree it's a good test for Bitcoin.  I agree that I need to take responsibility for my coins.  
That in NO WAY justifies putting Bitcoin through this, or creating an unnecessary threat to the value of my coins.  The people behind this NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, TOO. 
I will REMEMBER all the people and companies involved in this.  They made this bed they are about to lie in.  People here will be regularly reminding Bitcoiners who not to do business with.  
Creating threats and problems for your customers is VERY bad business.

Nice rationalization for stealing people's B2X coins.  Any other kinds of theft you can rationalize to yourself?
Splitting the chain for practical purposes reduces the value (splits off some of the market capitalization.)  Splitting the chain and taking part of the value of my coins is theft.  The more successful your fork is, the more of Bitcoin's market capitalization you will steal.   
Are you still pretending not to understand this issue?  "Gosh, Bitcoin holders are all so upset - over NOTHING!  I just don't understand..."

Let's let the Segwit upgrade play out first.  There are valid reasons for preferring this method for a capacity increase.  Segwit and LN will certainly solve the problems in the near term.

I have still not "assigned" any more money to this person than I explicitly sent him.  If he tweaks the  B2X fraud network to get more, that is theft.  How  is this not obvious???  


If you are looking for a relevant law enforcement agency, of course Bitcoin does not have that.  But an action does not suddenly become moral or correct simply because I can't send someone to jail.  
You are also implying that I wish to hold Miners accountable.  There is plenty to spread the blame to, but least of all lowly miners.  It's the people at the top, directing this sloppy split that deserve scorn, and boycotting.


This again.  Give me a break.  I DISAGREE VEHEMENTLY with sabotage of any kind, to anything or anyone.  We may have to leave this as it is.


Again - you are trying to make an immoral action "right" by pointing out that Bitcoin has no legal protections.

Speaking of "disingenuous", the 30% you speak of wasn't a vote of everyone involved with Bitcoin.  The only vote that represented ME was the UASF.   
So this all comes down to who you think owns or has the right to control Bitcoin.  Consensus - to me - means EVERYONE involved, not just miners with Chinese ties or large companies with banking ties.  If I want a currency controlled only by large financial interests, I have lots of choices - Bitcoin becoming just another one of those would be very, very sad.


If this were true, B2X would be worth more than BTC in futures trading.  This clearly is not the case.   Exactly which "market" are you referring to?  
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:32:23
I think worst case scenario would be BTC losing a lot of its value (capitalization), but certainly not being extinguished.  BTC fans would not allow that to happen.  Whatever it takes to keep BTC going will happen.
If B2X is more valuable than BTC, that would not likely be a permanent situation.   That would arguably be an opportunity.  Sell your B2X and buy into the price-depressed BTC for the inevitable rebound.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:25:16
I have to say - you are one of the most unusual people I have ever conversed with.
You are obviously intelligent, which makes some of the bizarre positions you have taken (that I am more responsible for theft than thieves who steal from me, for example) very hard to reconcile.
It occurs to me that I would argue the same way if I were paid by somebody to argue for a position.  This does not mean that this is the only explanation.
It's also how a person might argue if he held an overriding ideological belief, that was overriding his logic.  It's just that I don't think I've ever seen that in a truly intelligent person.
You could be an extreme libertarian.  I could see arguing that maximum freedom is more important than stopping all crime.  But not even that would make a person argue that thieves are free from personal responsibility or moral behavior, or that something must be moral just because otherwise criminal behavior isn't covered by laws that apply to Bitcoin.
Any light you can shed?
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:44:01
Here's what did it for me - remember the taxes you will owe.  Selling BTC to cash is a taxable event.  So unless you expect a bigger than 20% drop is about to happen, you'll lose less money staying in.  
And even if a huge drop has started to happen, you have to be sure there's more than 20% of the drop left to go.  That's pretty much an impossible call to make.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:53:22
Nothing in particular is wrong with a blocksize increase.  This is just not the right time, and not the way to do it.   Blocksize has already increased due to Segwit.  So there's no need to rush another blocksize increase into place.

Obviously, I disagree strongly.  Especially that you believe they have no ethical or moral obligations to protect others from their selfish actions (this kind of thinking could justify rape, theft, or murder.)  Since I can't change this (bizarre) opinion of yours, the only goal I can achieve from this discussion is to get you to clearly state your belief, which I believe most readers (by far) will disagree with.


Which of course I will do.  And I encourage others reading this to do. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:38:11


Incorrect.  I also pointed out the B2X coins don't belong to someone else.  They belong to me.


Bizarre.  So if someone stole my stock market investments from me, according to you - that is not theft?  Or I suppose it's more like someone just stole some of the market value -  perhaps found a way to steal my capital gains check.   
Look - easy definition. Someone gets something of value from me, without my consent.  That's theft.


I agree.  But that's not what this is.  It's one thing to offer a competing product.  It's quite another to offer a competing product while actively sabotaging the competition.  
I can compete with Coca Cola by making my own soft drink.  However, I can't pretend MY product is the real Coca Cola while letting the air out of all the real Coca Cola delivery trucks.
And if I owned Coke stock, you'd be damaging the market value of my Coke stock, too.  Real lawsuits have been generated from stuff a lot like this.  Do you deny that lawsuits over the market value of stocks have happened?


And who actually actively "assigns" some of their money to some stranger?   This sounds like yet another euphemism for fraud to me.  "Hey, these people agreed to be defrauded of their money.  Look, I have this phony agreement nobody signed."


Nobody disagrees with taking personal responsibility for their actions.  I just don't agree with applying responsibility SELECTIVELY.  Thieves and fraudsters are ALSO responsible for their actions.
If I leave my door unlocked and get robbed, well, I was certainly dumb, and bear responsibility.  That does not mean that IT'S OK TO ROB PEOPLE.  It's the thieves that are in trouble here, not me.  My transgression was just a fraction of the wrongdoing in this situation.

Well, OK, that's not quite right.  My actual coins are safe.  I'm concerned for the not-as-well-educated friends I introduced to Bitcoin.  
The issues around this are technical and difficult to explain.  Noobs without friends like me are the people who could lose coins, or be very confused about what "Bitcoin" actually is, and may wind up with their coins defaulted to a much less valuable chain.  Without me, none of my friends would know how to get their "real" Bitcoins back.   Some real people could be put into this situation.
This fork is a very poor idea, and appears to be poorly executed, in a too-short timeframe.  All it will do is make a great number of Bitcoin holders very angry at the perpetrators, especially if it slows Bitcoin's growth for any period of time. 
From my point of view, that is the silver lining.  Bitcoin is still a community, most of the Noobs are connected to the more experienced Bitcoiners who introduced them to the opportunity.  So word will spread, and B2X-supporting businesses will likely suffer.  This will reduce their power and influence.  
Does your "personal responsibility" ethos demand that the less-educated bitcoin owners must suffer for the sake of the B2X believers grab for control of Bitcoin?  
Or do the forkers have some "personal responsibility" of their own to make the fork as safe as possible?

Look at a long-term chart of Bitcoin, like this one:
Draw a straight line connecting most of the lowest points on the chart.  That's Bitcoin's long-term support line.  
Every time the price gets too far away from that line, we get a correction taking us back toward it.  
We all want the price to go up.  But if it goes up too fast, we risk longer and more severe corrections.  To this end, modest pullbacks are good, they keep the growth from getting too far out of control. Many small corrections are better than fewer but necessarily huge corrections.

Don't see many serious answers here, so I'll try. 
Most likely lowest point I think will be in the 5000s.  Price will trend sideways till summer, then climb back out, perhaps with time to make a new high by the end of the year.
Worst case, the price will climb down to the old support line from 2014-15.  Depending how long it takes to get there, price could be in the 4000s or even 3000s.  
It's VERY unlikely to get worse than this.  That old support line can be extended back to 2011.  It's never been violated.   
Even if we do go all the way down to the old support line, it should bring us back to near 10000 by year's end.  And we'd end 2018 about where we started it.
