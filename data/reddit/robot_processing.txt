Yes, the transaction was for the exact same amount. It sat there dormant from 11/13/17 to 12/20/17.

What if you use your bitcoin to buy some other alt coin and consolidate back to one bitcoin address to minimize transaction cost?

To me it looks like i sent BCH to a BCH wallet with the same address as my BTC wallet. There was no BTC in the wallet at the time of the Tx. When Coinbase implemented BCH, they sent BCH to a different address. 
I just don't understand how Coinbase would take a BTC/BCH split address and assigned that same BCH address to someone else.

This is what I'm banking on too.
You talked to your skeptical uncle Bill about it on Thanksgiving. You see him a month later and to your surprise he's changed his mind about those "bitty coins". Classic uncle Bill. Now you're sitting around Christmas morning walking him through setting up a coinbase account.

You’re right. I’m sorry.

So how is it that there was a transaction on 12/20/17 from BCH wallet 1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3 to another BCH wallet 13CQW2huoWaq3qzwz6ybAXkEX4FwskygH8 ?

Negative. I sent BCH to my BTC wallet. This transaction never went through. The transaction that did go though was BCH to BCH wallet with the same address.

In a way, i hope in dips down real soon. So I can buy low.

Currently on bittrex. Transferring bitcoin from GDAX to Bittrex and investing in smaller coins. Currently hoped on Mona coin.

   Back on 11/13/17 I accidentally sent 0.14967 **BCH** from my Kraken account to my Coinbase **BTC** wallet. I realized I made a mistake and contacted Coinbase support (No Response).
   As of last week Coinbase began implementing BCH (Limited) support. Under their FAQ page they describe that 


However, I never received my BCH into my BCH wallet (As of 12/27/18). The BTC wallet I originally sent it to was [1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3]( As you can see, the transaction was confirmed under the SAME BCH Wallet address.
I had been tracking this transaction as it stated the funds had not been spent... up until 12/20/17. What happened on 12/20/17? I sent 0.00349 **BTC** to the same exact address on my Coinbase Wallet. [See confirmed transactions]( I wanted to make sure this address did in fact belong to me, and I was right. The transaction went through and I have that BTC in my wallet right now.
However, If you look at the original transaction, you can see that the whole 0.14967 of BCH was moved to a new BCH address [13CQW2huoWaq3qzwz6ybAXkEX4FwskygH8]( at the same time I sent BTC to my BTC wallet on coinbase.
So... Can someone explain what happened?
Here's a timeline
* 11/13/17 - 0.14967 BCH &gt; 1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3 (BTC Wallet on Coinbase)
* 12/20/17 5:20 pm - 0.00349 BTC &gt; 1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu3 (BTC Wallet on Coinbase)
* 12/20/17 8:17 pm - 0.14967 BCH &gt; 13CQW2huoWaq3qzwz6ybAXkEX4FwskygH8 (Unknown Wallet)

My spouse has an insurmountable amount of student debt, about 7.5 BTC worth. I know this is shameless, but without getting over this bump, we will forever be stuck paying it off.

I sent BCH to a BTC wallet on coinbase prior to them supporting BCH. The transaction was confirmed as BCH and BTC wallets are the same addresses. I was hoping that when Coinbase began supporting BCH I would see my initial transaction but I have not. In-fact, the opposite has occurred. It looks like someone had access to the BCH wallet that was a duplicate of my BTC wallet and transferred it to another BCH wallet on the same day I transferred BTC to my BTC wallet 1NqqpzRzNJUcBSbUj76dFv3uHae48jStu.

I guess you would have to still aggregate all your small transactions and that's where you would get dinged. Hmm. OP is just screwed i guess.

No, anyone that's been here at least a month should have expected a big dip. Now we buy low!!
