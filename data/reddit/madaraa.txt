Gemini takes years for identity to verify. How and why they expect people to use their service as opposed to others when their verification times range up to 4 weeks is beyond me

Not true. Mine has been in verification stage for 2 weeks. This one is the third.

Well I can lose hope in gemini. I've been waiting like a week for mine to verify, thought it was some bug or they are short handed. If its 3 weeks for you then I can say goodbye to that lol

if anyone could explain how to buy at dips? any bitcoin transaction ive done so far i've had to wait over 5 days to recieve the bitcoin.... if I buy at coinbase right now it will take 7 days to get from the bank to my account, does that mean I will get the value I bought it at (now) or the value of btc when it hits my account?

How am i supposed to buy low sell high when there is a 2 day transaction fee for a card i cant even get processed because their ID verification is fucked, and a 1 week wait for bank transactions....
