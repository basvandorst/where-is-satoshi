Few things:
1) Why are banks making us less free? I can buy literally anything material good or service I can think of with cash or my credit/debit card.
2) How is bitcoin more sound than traditional money? If you don't trust banks that's one thing (I think that's naive but if it's your opinion than more power to you) but are there any other valid reasons?
3) If bitcoin wins I don't win because I don't own bitcoin. **gasps**
4) "the price is impossible speculation with wild price volatility" is not a good thing. Quite the opposite.
5) "the vision is about a transfer of wealth, power, and control by completely flipping the financial world upside down" sounds like someone who is bad at handling their money says.
6) I have no idea how the average cost of an IPO effects me (which is probably because it doesn't). Also 3.7 million dollars is not a lot of money to a significant portion of companies.

Well that's like comparing the US economy with the monopoly bank bro. You need to trust hundreds of thousands (maybe millions? I don't know, doesn't matter) of anonymous people to have the same paranoid mindset as you. I can look into precise detail about how my investments are being spent, I can see why they went up or down and I can carry that information to make educated decisions about what will happen in the future. 2008 was shitty but the economy came back as it will always do.

I appreciate the response. Can't say I agree but at least I understand better now.

Lololol me too. I just have a job because it's fun, I would do it for free if I could.

I read quite a lot. I actually have a book on blockchain "The Blockchain of Business" coming in tomorrow! What books are you referring to and what fake news are these books refuting?

Stock market will *always* recover though. Always. I would bet every penny I have. With even a small amount care buy some mutual funds, some index funds, and some stocks and over the very long term you will always make money. I guess I would prefer to always make a little bit of money than to sometimes make a lot of money (which is what risk adverse means).

I bet you make great tin foil hats

You don't trust accounting auditors but you do trust a currency where 0.00088% of the anonymous holders own 17.49% of bitcoin? I'm sorry but I just don't see the logic.

Well good thing I didn't retire in 2000! But if I was responsible with my money a crash like that wouldn't spell disaster and before long I would be as I was. As wikipedia puts it: "From 1987 to 1995, the Dow rose each year by about 10%, but from 1995 to 2000, the Dow rose 15% a year. While the bear market began in 2000, by July and August 2002, the index had only dropped to the same level it would have achieved if the 10% annual growth rate followed during 1987-1995 had continued up to 2002."

I don't understand this response.

The stock market will *always* recover. A.L.W.A.Y.S. When has it crashed and not recovered? Counter question: if/when btc crashes, how do you know it will be saved?

The huge gains some are seeing (kudos to them) can go away just as quickly. Most people are risk-adverse so it surprises me that many people don't see it that way.

Well I could use the same logic. I could say that if Buffet tanks Berk A that's just a one-off event too. Stocks go up because you bought your computer, stocks go up because you're sitting on a chair, stocks go up because you're (probably) paying for the internet you're using. Crypto goes up because your buddy said it's the hot new thing and you tossed your hat into the ring.
That is my impression at least, but I want to understand why that's wrong, if it is.

Good for you. What train of logic brought you to invest in BTC? That's probably the core of my question.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:36:18
What train of logic has lead you to that conclusion?
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:35:02
Why are you so confident in that? How has your mentality turned out for you?
