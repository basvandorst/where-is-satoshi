Bitcoin on lightning is censored but crypto’s in general are censored.
@_date: 2019-03-02 20:13:01
Actually I’ve been following bitcoin for a long ass time it’s seriously not what it use to be.
@_date: 2019-03-02 18:41:45

@_date: 2016-06-08 00:42:19
Shut up

Once lightning towers keep advancing only people who can afford them will own them. In other words that would be new age banks or telecom companies it’s going to become the new age industry fully controlled by whatever government or corporation you are under. This is the reason the elites chose bitcoin, it went from one of the best things in the world to a honeypot for the elites to control us with their new financial system. You either invest in bitcoin or don’t invest at all because it’s really their chosen coin.

Facebook and JPM will obviously use their coins to rate you.
@_date: 2019-03-02 18:56:04
We both know bitcoin isn’t censor free anymore
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:26:38
Exactly blockchain is just another finical system trap by the same people who run the central banks but have a world currency as bitcoin

You wouldn’t need to trade it against anything the price is set and will continue to climb. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 05:43:14
And the 10000 BTC on the pizza?
@_date: 2019-02-08 02:07:07
I agree 
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:44:16
We will have to wait and find out , maybe another crypto will be out there like ETH.

Samsung will be ready to give your keys up to the government any day.
@_date: 2019-02-08 01:54:09
The same people who run the banks and the government are secretly the same ones who created bitcoin...I love bitcoin but it’s the sad truth.
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:42:54
So did you see that JP Morgan just made their own cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:19:43
Truth

@_date: 2019-02-13 20:19:27
So in order to use my own brain and think outside the box that means I’m on something?
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:00:58
This is so bad
@_date: 2019-02-15 16:55:31
I thought chase doesn’t let you buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:47:10
This is the main problem, I’m sure the governments will have a controlled mining pool and independent people won’t be able to mine.

Fuck Israel genocide criminal state that steals our tax dollars
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:01:48
Trump is just another player in the game he’s purposely placed as president so he can disrupt the US dollar and the government. It would be scary to see Facebook as the head Corp of the corporate government that means we will be forced to upload every single detail and information on our profiles and our lives will become so digital and depressing. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 00:33:05
What would be a global civil war?
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:29:10
Yeah but they won’t expose this till everyone’s on it the goal is to keep currency completely digital and make it suitable for a one world government. It’s easier to take peoples rights with digital currency.
@_date: 2019-02-17 05:15:10
Loool 
@_date: 2019-02-17 05:08:37
That’s how it’s going to end up though the government will control our digital money 
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:36:45
Agreed , I’d say 2020-2030 is the corporate age
@_date: 2019-02-17 04:12:36
