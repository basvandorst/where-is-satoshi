More importantly 


@_date: 2017-12-11 03:04:05
I fucking bet it has, pricks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:54:05
they have localbitcoin up there?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:07:21


Roger, checking.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:45:53
does it have to be in-person? Use international wires or something? 
You could spread your money around... little bit on coinbase, little bit on kraken, gemini, whatever. 
IDK, they're all run on hamster wheels as far as I'm concerned and not trustworthy at all. I deposit funds on them via credit card because I know I can chargeback if necessary. Dunno if I'd do ACH or anything. Coinbase is slowly regaining my respect, after it took over a week to get verified after about two dozen attempts. And I'm a US citizen. 
FWIW, when it comes time to sell, I'm not sure what I'm going to do/who I'm going to use.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:35:30
How much are you talking and why do u have to sell in such small increments?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:44:32
Good on you. Keep reposting this HOURLY until you get your money. It's the only way. Fuck Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:05:00
gdax/coinbase are frozen on verifying ID, despite already been done and if you look at my account it says Verified OK on it. Gemini has been error-free so far, just playing the waiting game.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:59:20
Serious question. How do you plan on going from BTC to USD? Specifically, which hamster-wheel exchange are you going to trust to xfer the funds?

IMHO, paper wallets are by far the safest. I'm also the same guy that stores thousands in cash in his fire safe.
*Trust no one*
Yes, my house may be burgled and cash is less hostile than BTC, but there is no way I'm leaving my private key in the hands of someone else.
Anyhow, the way to do it is to download a free linux distro, one of the quick, tiny packages that you can boot from a CD.
Do that, get a fresh, unadulterated Operating System running. Be disconnected from the internet the entire time.
Generate your private/public key using vetted, open source software such as
 (you can download the script before you boot to your clean OS so you can run it locally w/o internet).
Print them out on paper, put them in your safe. Make a copy or two to clean usb drives. 
Done.

Why what? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:25:19
PS: Is the .000423 an exact or made-up number?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:04
........for what exactly? C'mon.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:00:26
They have a feedback system similar to eBay. I'd only ever do it in person. There is a guy near me I plan on meeting, in a public place. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:29:36
Do you trust a website that can't even stay online during demand surges to hold your cash? Coinbase can't stay up, Kraken can't stay up, none of them have telephone numbers for customer support, none of them can respond to customer support within days, let alone hours. Their help pages are written by teenagers.
Do you trust these companies to hold your cash?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:54:30
You can always move your coin. I move my coin to a paper wallet immediately after buying. Don't trust exchanges to hold your money. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:04:07
I have one about 30 mins away. 12%, but imagine the convenience beats all the online nonsense.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:40:03
thx fren
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:44:17
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:33
which is why you immediately move them to a paper wallet.

This is the stupidest post I've ever read.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:24:51
nice thx
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:59:33
Just the fees.

Which routinely hack into "secure" websites all the time. Inb4 nicehash.


I routinely let strangers rummage through my fire safe.

Guess I'll dig out my webcam.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:55:46
I'll give it a shot, thanks.

Buttons don't work. Like, physically, the Submit button does. not. work. in the app.

no no, let's cherry pick to our gluttonous heart's content
