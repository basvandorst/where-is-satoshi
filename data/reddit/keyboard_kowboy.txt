I think it may have something to do with the recent, largely positive, news from the FED. (
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:04:54
Thats a typo, should be \\o and o//.

I agree.  I buy weekly from coinbase linked to my chase account.  No issues... but I am considering opening an account somewhere else just for bitcoin buying/selling.  But, there's gotta be something else to these accounts of closure.

The value in a system is also how well it reacts to problems.  Just compare these companies to Gox and I think it's pretty clear.  Nothing will ever be 100% secure... but they do their best to position themselves to mitigate and minimize the scope of the intrusion and treat their customers with respect, not like hapless animals.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:06:41
Yeah, positive he doesn't.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:47:34
True, but he has nothing but respect from a lot of industries and is a true evangelist for this whole technological invention that is Bitcoin (not just the currency).  If a guy like Antonopoulos ends up being deceitful and a fraud, which simply won't happen, then I personally will lose all hope for Bitcoin.
I think it's important to imbue trust in those that have continuously proven themselves... that's all we've really got in the end anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:16:42
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:51:02
I'm slightly concerned about balancing issues... every invention is completely unique based on sliding scales/curves.  Sounds like constant IMBA updates/patches/tears.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:56:22
Certainly a fair statement, but Gox repetitively exemplified how *not* to run a business, continuously displayed an inability to properly operate the exchange, and people continued to do business there... Coinbase and Blockchain.info have done nothing but prove their competence and loyalty to this truly groundbreaking technology.
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:28:08
You lost your coins because you didn't go back to mining?  How does that work exactly?
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:56:19
So does this utilize a 'centralized' block chain for each coin?  Doesn't that sort of defeat the true purpose?  I completely support the need to come up with a solution that solves not having to download the entire block chain (its getting ridiculous) but at what cost?
@_date: 2014-09-05 19:39:22
Is that including gratuity?

@_date: 2014-02-27 03:35:10
Andreas Antonopoulos just personally audited Coinbase two days.  He confirmed that, at the time, 98.8% of all of their customers coins were safely in cold storage.  And when they say cold storage, they mean a real honest to God cold storage.  The BS comments from Mt.Gox claiming that the hot wallet was hacked which exposed 'a leak in the cold storage'.  Uhm... that doesn't happen if it were true cold storage.
I do agree that you should inevitably never trust any 'cloud' based wallets.  I really don't feel all that bad for people that though it was a good idea to store 100's or 1000's of BTC on Mt.Gox.  However, in the case of Coinbase and Blockchain.info, they take security extremely serious and in Coinbase's case they have a ridiculously small hot wallet in which theft can occur.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:53:52
Bitcoin has not failed you... The human condition has failed you.  Don't give up on a monumental technological break through by being butt hurt by a handful of mining companies looking to stay ahead of an absurdly wicked difficulty curve.
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:13:23
I don't think a lot of people fully appreciate the arbitrage that LTC and BTC create.  Being able to convert to and from these two cryptos in order to take advantage of both of their strengths on an as-needed basis helps create a stronger ecosystem for both coins.
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:12:47
Bitcoin.com just looks plain awful... and that bitcoin symbol... come on.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:45:18
Too many people (including most mainstream media) are directly linking a single exchange with the entirety of the Bitcoin Ecosystem/Protocol.  This is ultimately good for the economy... Mt.Gox has been (and will be in the short term) a black eye.  I'm excited to see competent, well managed companies step into the limelight and continue to propel this ecosystem and all of it's opportunities.  Also, anyone who thinks it's a good idea to store most of their wealth on an unregulated cryptocurrency website... shame on you and may this be another lesson learned for the general public... trust no one... especially the 'Magic The Gathering Online eXchange'... lawlz.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:05:40
Don't all Blockchain.info deposits/withdrawals occur on the general ledger (the actual blockchain)?  That's all public information...

Uh oh, theblaze.com thinks this is bad news... Pshh, come on.  The fact that the FED is interested in Bitcoin again is a good thing... it needs some regulation and there is news leaking that they're doing their best to avoid hampering growth while being able to supply consumers with protection.  This IS ACTUALLY good news!

Did anyone else notice when asked for FIVE things he likes and FIVE things he hated... he listed like 12 things he liked (all food)... and then listed a bunch of things he hated (all food except for press conferences) but also happened to mention more FOOD he liked while discussing the foods he didn't like.... He;s in the wrong business.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:44:14
U.S. Tax Law requires you to report any and all capital gains.  You're on the honor system to divulge of any Bitcoin related capital gains on your tax statements... but if you're audited, you've broken the law, and now you're in trouble.  I agree with others here stating that this should be treated no differently than any other currency you may have been paid in (and then presumably reported on earning).
Edit: trated = treated
@_date: 2017-01-29 00:53:46
I'm with you especially considering that Coinbase has now successfully curated a NYS Bitlicense... legally, the Bitcoin is yours.

How quick some of you have forgotten what the political landscape of Bitcoin looks like... it's all just water under the bridge now that Segwit2x is likely to be activated?  Forgot what it took to get here?
I don't think alt coins 'ride' on the back of Bitcoin... I think they 'fall' back on Bitcoin, which is totally rational and good.

That's well and true... But it isn't active on Bitcoin, making it (technically) inferior.  Use cases that need LN and bigger blocks can use Litecoin now.

This is obviously conjecture on your part.  There's a clear correlation to exchange volume when this happens... It's actually held up MUCH better than it has in the past.  I hate that it happens just as much as anyone else, but these are growing pains and I have not (personally) been let down by Coinbase concerning their overall ecosystem.  I really don't think it's fair to assert that this is related to any nefarious activity by Coinbase.

They just sent out an official communication a few days ago apologizing, stating openly what was happening with the insane amount of growth they're experienced, and what they're doing in the short, mid, and long term to handle it.
