After blocksize increase, not anymore. SW is important, so better done it right.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:15:37
Actually depends on what implementation of full node you use.

Nodes that running XT get DDoSed.
Pools that supporting BIP101 get DDoSed too.
Let's look at this facts.
@_date: 2015-12-23 04:23:01


Lucky you!
@_date: 2015-12-03 22:54:45
As I understand the way Bitcoin works, BIP101 changes hard blocksize limit, so we can manoeuvre under this limit without another hard-fork with just soft-forks (like if GB blocks will be really too much in year 2030) or miners could have own limits on their nodes, like we have 749 KB limit for a long time.
With taking this into account, could be more precise with danger of aggressivnes of BIP101? With ability to set soft blocksize cap under hard blocksize cap, I just can't see where is danger here. 
About BIP100 - sorry, but I just disagree with giving away hard blocksize limit voting to miners, it's better to be automatic - less human factor is better, and you know it's true. 
Also take a look:  (page 28) - your opinion on BIP101 could be manipulated, think about it.

Oh, you have already completed the study on this topic? Care enough to provide more numbers of future fees and new algorithm for fee calculation?
@_date: 2015-12-30 07:20:09


Table in this paper assume blocks always 100% full. For example with introduction of 8MB blocks this January there will be no claimed "Immediate excluded nodes" percent. Do I need to say more about this one?


Miners behaviour at time of GHosh.io crisis is not taken into account here. Why?
 


Verification time increase, that correct, however if it will hurt with modern CPU and modern verification methods is not clear. Propagation algorithms need to be improved for sure.


tl;dr from this that proves your original point, please:

I seen few other forums out there.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:17:46
Well... you don't get it. 1MB is not enough right now. 2MB will be not enough in January of 2017 (or if every single user will actually upgrade wallet (so much for soft-forking!) and all starting to send segwit transaction, maybe a little bit later)

It's true for softfork version of SegWit too.
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:17:58
Because of 300% transaction growth for latest two years, why anyone could think it will slowdown in 2016 or in 2017? And there is another global economic crisis ahead.

No, you are. I am not.


Miners get paid in BTC. They never went again BTC (in the sense described in this paper) and I have yet to see the evidence they ever will, because in this case they lost the profit.


Well, this time it's propagation algorithms that need to be improved. That it.

I think most important points here that:
1. We now have this cMix idea, that can be implemented in other applications, if it will be proven to be good idea (not sure about this, but we will see).
2. If all code will be open sourced, I can't see why it can't be modified to work on more random servers that people will deploy on their own. However, I still think i2p is more secure.

XT nodes deployment rise was stopped by same attack that hit me. This turning point was perfectly visible on graphs and by timing of threads about started attack in relevant subreddit.

I was hit with 10 Gbit, and I have just 100 Mbit connection. However, the fact that I have 100 Mbit didn't stop 10 Gbit traffic (with my IPv4 as destination) coming to my ISP, so ISP have no choice but put me behind NAT, then attack stopped.
That how XT nodes has been get down.

@_date: 2017-03-15 19:23:08
 - So, Core is do UASF or not?
If node without SegWit support can't verify SegWit transaction then SegWit soft-fork is not backward compatible. You can't ignore SegWit tx if someone send it to you (for example as payment or donation).
How consensus can be found in highly censored environment? I also see businesses being oppressed (if businesses state support for alternative implementation - it get censored at subreddit with most of subscribers, like it happened with Coinbase) so not sure how they could disagree with politburo on anything and doesn't get ban at the same time.

So when I touched actual technical subject (API instead of SegWit) you ignore it... why is that, I wonder?  


Your avoidance of reading roadmaps of other nodes software begins to resemble the behaviour of a religious person.


There is no implementation but Core and Adam is the messenger of the Core... like this, right?




Please don't pretend you doesn't know about BIP109 activation conditions.


I know about "P2P Electronic Cash System" Bitcoin, that was Bitcoin I bought. Now some people trying to turn it into settlement layer and claim it's right thing to do at this point, which I politely disagree, if you please.

Wow, you are described mining as it is right now. Highly irresponsible, you said? Yeah, we actually looking at negative consequences of this right now. However, I believe, miners eventually get where they mistake, [one way]( or [another](
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:41:46
It's nice that you ignored second and third link.


Never heard about for example btcd?


On roadmaps... did you read it? 


Then why Core node implementation don't provide API for requesting block in compressed format (without signatures) for light wallets that need to inspect blockchain content, but do not intend to validate it? (idea) This will give SegWit advantages without doing high risk changes like changing blockchain format via soft-fork. Sure, we still need SegWit to prevent transaction malleability attack, but why rush such change via soft-fork if we need to do things right?

Tell me, did you read roadmaps of other projects?


Why you can't see multiple teams there? What's wrong with multiple node implementations and multiple teams?

1. What maximum capacity SegWit could provide? Drop that 2MB bullshit and find real numbers.
2. What capacity SegWit will provide if, let's say, 10% of transactions will be SegWit, and another 90% will be non-SegWit? (Since Core push softfork implementation people are free to not upgrade and don't use SegWit.)

@_date: 2017-03-16 04:35:02


Oh, yeah, and HK agreement was signed between "individuals"... I see , clever stuff. Continue to pretend that pools operators look at them as individuals not as like they represented Core, continue to pretend that SegWit soft-fork being pushed as UASF not because Core failed to convince pools and miners, and now need any other way to force it on people.


This is not how for example business works. If you accept Bitcoin - frequently you need to know about transaction before it will get mined, therefore switch to node with SegWit support or bring up additional node with SegWit support became necessary. Either way, Core will claim that SegWit is "supported" by community.


So how you are going to evaluate opinion on such a broad place besides metric that is vulnerable to Sybil attack?


But for example read media that was brainwashed by propaganda, like bitnovosti.com

Russian and English version of this article is opposite.
English version state "Bitcoin ban won't pass first reading" while in Russian version Moiseev said "In practice it hardly can pass the first reading" about another bill draft that practically almost legalize Bitcoin (except mining) by clarification "surrogate money" definition - proposed definition include only "“surrogate money” issued on the territory of the Russian Federation" hence that exclude Bitcoin mined not in Russia (yeah, meaningless limitation). And Moiseev doubt this bill will pass first reading.

Sorry, I didn't realize you don't get logical errors in your own messages. You are replaced existing suggestions (like BIP100, 101, 102, 202) with your own idea (use blocksize that doesn't fit current technology) and then trying to prove that if your idea is wrong, then existing suggestions is wrong too.

I think right now they can actually because there is not many people they need control to control Bitcoin. Crazy thought experiment:
1. What if US government control not all Core contributors, but enough to use veto power on some protocol changes? Should be easy, isn't it?
2. What if China government control mining farms at large pools in China? Why not?
3. What if for this very special case like global digital currency this two governments team up for some goal? What community can do about this?

5-10 percent of hashrate should not have veto power for the rest of miners ecosystem. Essentially your idea is to make possible to attack Bitcoin with 1/10 or 1/20 of Bitcoin hashrate, which is much worse than 51% attack.

When it was last time when you verify source code of software update you are getting on your computer or smartphone? Motherboard of this computer running vendor firmware instead of LibreBoot? If your answers is "never" and "yes" then you simply lying. That it.
Now, try to be more open to difference shades of security, because you already rely on insecure environment just like businesses that rely on working zero-conf (BitPay, Coinbase, ShapeShift).

In my opinion it's like paper cash / digital transaction situation. When merchant accept cash he doesn't need to do KYC/AML, trace funds, etc. When merchant accept transaction via some digital wallet, this digital wallet usually already take care of KYC/AML because they have to do so. I think it's not very likely that government will order merchants to trace every incoming Bitcoin transaction (it's like digital cash essentially) but if on-chain transaction cost make usage of big LN hubs unavoidable for customer - we open up our back for stab - it will be very easy and logical for government to impose restrictions (maybe as I described, maybe somehow different) on merchants and hubs.

No, it doesn't. Some individuals and businesses would pay good money to have open hardware:  (but even Talos is not 100% open, for example GPU firmware will be closed, this is somehow mitigated by IOMMU isolation). There is also Replicant firmware for smartphones, but this is also not ideal solution (GSM/LTE module firmware is closed).
Do you even accept the fact that security of hardware and software you currently is rely on is not 100% perfect?

Not for transactions inside channel - that my main point.


LN could barely works for merchants that user visit on regular basis - even in this case user and merchant need spend time and mBTC on opening channel (again, how to do this in first visit? Even if they get lucky to get into next block, this next block could be one hour away - imagine awkward waiting). User also need to thoughtfully (because of open/close channel cost) determine amount of mBTC that he plan to spend at this merchant and then lock this funds in the channel. Okay, if merchants ever agree to put own funds into LN channels with customers instead of just opening user accounts and hold customer funds theoretically LN could work for regular purchases. I still not understand how this supposed to work for not-so-regular purchases, besides possible case where many merchants and many customers use big LN hubs so they just need to have open channels with hubs, not with each other, but then this hubs will act kinda like banks - regulated many transmitting services wth AML and KYC procedures.
I fail to see in LN something other than choice between broken UX and deviation from basic Bitcoin principles. Sure, there is interesting cases for LN, but this is not replacement for on-chain transactions as people like to claim: 


Not sure how stalling adoption and userbase growth will help with decentralisation, opposite is more likely. Also on what blocksize limit most of computers that currently running full nodes will unable to do so anymore?

Probably you not get idea. If businesses is prohibited to accept some form of payment - they comply. Businesses in China and Russia is prohibited from accepting BTC, and they de facto comply. Businesses for example in USA potentially can be ordered to open payment channels only with complying LN hubs, and and then they will not use some hubs from Tor.


Agree, this need to be improved.

Merchants in user's country can be allowed to open channels only with complying LN hubs... 


How LN hub is different from for example Coinbase? Both transact money between customers and merchants, and Coinbase have to comply, and even trace source of funds.


Sounds like a plan, unfortunately not likely to be implemented with Core:

Other solutions is not production ready. Average blocksize rise four times for latest two years, without increase of orphan rate or drop of full nodes. So bigger blocksize limit should be ok for now.
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:18:39
Why open (two transactions?) and then close channel (one more transaction for settlement?) for payment to cashier instead of just one tx? What logic behind paying triple fee instead of one fee?


Well, if you expect this channel opening/closing fees to cover miners expenses there should be some idea of how this will works and at what cost to user and merchant. If you have this idea in mind, let's have a talk about it.
