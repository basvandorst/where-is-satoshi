This is great news overall. Means WU will soon be out of business but they will own a small piece of the bitcoin companies putting them out.

Worlds leading debit cards? Never tried, can you say how your better than E-Coin, Xapo, Shift?
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:36:14
Awesome! I have been wanting to test a virtual card. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:26:39
Great artist and opportunity.  This is a very good idea.  Good luck

Gems is the first project that I feel can bring bitcoin to the average person in a technology we all use everyday.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:42:20
I will try it out

Is crypto articles looking to raise funding through Lighthouse?

good news
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:29:16
security in crypto and the internet in general is the  concern I have ATM
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:42:53
its been a bad month for mining operations
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:52:03
having to much good news is a good problem
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:24:12
I would say there are many. My personal favorites are SpaceBIT  who will create a decentralized global baking system. Factom who will use the blockchain to store unlimmitted ammounts of data and bring the blockchain to endless ammounts of sectors   and Gems which is simple but can bring crypto tech to everyone. @_date: 2015-01-14 17:42:49
this is interesting. What will happen to all these services with sunken costs. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:53:29
great service!
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:21:24
At least there are some forward thinking banks that will be dealing with digital currencies soon. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:09:03
Pier Exchange coming soon will change everything

moved on from Coin Base. You have freezed my funds twice and thats enough for me. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 10:51:05
this is a cool new feature
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:26:30
possibly yes, but they want to work directly with governments from around the world.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:10:32
There is no presale. The project will be funded through private VC. There may or may not be a token issued in the future SpaceBIT projects but not for Space Bank @_date: 2015-01-07 23:09:18
higher efficiency is most important. But both are ideal
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:39:04
it really is an amazing team behind the project. Professor Angell has been working on the concept of a Space Bank long before Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:32:11
do you offer solutions? If payment processors are shut down then how will fiat move in and out. We need more and better options not less.
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:37:01
I think I will stop speculating and just watch the ride. I am long bitcoin so if it drops again I would like to get 10 for $1000
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:34:37
this is just the start. Being able to store the worlds records and information on the blockchain. What a phenomenal innovation 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:24:42
the developing world are some that benefit most from BTM's. I would imagine there are people right now planning on entering these markets.
@_date: 2015-01-29 11:09:11
still all speculation
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:59:39
great idea for an article

there needs to be a cost of transaction top prevent spamming the system.
@_date: 2016-03-17 06:55:46
bitcoin = a way out of their terrible currencies. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:55:51
What is the main advantage of this?
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:11:04
we need some live coverage

Here is the Synereo blog with Synereo addressing The DAO. 
Despite being a major ETH and DAO holder, a part of me does not believe a rollback should be performed. We wanted “unstoppable applications”? We got them.
But my better angel says, if the position is – control is entirely in the hands of smart contracts, not smart people – that’s foolish. We must have both. Ethereum is now learning a lesson that Synereo took to heart from the beginning.
A rollback will set a precedent. This is a decision that is crucial to the growth of the decentralization movement and to the trust in the decentralization community. We should own up to the results of our experiment, and learn from them.
Synereo offers a social model; one that integrates measures of compassion in its code. Our reputation mechanism assures trust in people is still required, while tying the control assigned to them in formally-verified smart contracts – making that trust much harder to abuse.
We have and will continue our partnership with Ethereum to ensure the decentralized community can feel confident in the code we all deliver.  
– Dor Konforty, CEO Synereo

Over 500 Bitcoin! Impressive first 24 hours!
@_date: 2015-04-04 05:33:49
I would say with the progress the team has made so far that this is headed to become the  project in bitcoin. Someone using the blockchain for something other than financial transactions. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 18:00:31
Thanks for sharing your story. I was reading an I see so much negativity which is a main reason for the decline of the bitcoin community. Don't be discouraged from the negative comments. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:01:34
"Cost. The cost of writing data to the Bitcoin blockchain is expensive. Each Bitcoin transaction has a fee of about 3.5 cents. At current rates, it would cost $875 to store a 1MB photo from your iPhone." interesting idea. This makes perfect sense on how Factom will help bring down transaction costs.
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:45:32
Nice to see more companies signing up to use Factom API. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 12:48:31
any sneak previews of the announcements Factom is making?
@_date: 2015-03-26 17:39:50
I am excited for the start of the sale. I expect major numbers

I would love to know whats going down behind closed doors!
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:29:49
Finally a coin with real value. I have been waiting years for a coin to come out with intrinsic value. Getgems and Storj have come close but Factoids is what I am betting on!
@_date: 2015-03-28 16:12:25
Paul Snow is amazing!
@_date: 2016-05-14 20:16:15
has anyone actually tried the Bitpay card yet?
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:12:14
thats unfortunate. Have you talked to the company?
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:33:02
great discussion. I am a big fan of Paul Snow and Chris Ellis
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:21:27
I would like to see one of these projects funded. BitNation, ination, or PAX.... I am also a big fan of BitMesh but I dont think crowdfunding this could possibly be nearly enough.
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:35:00
@_date: 2015-03-27 06:18:35
Block Verify is one company building real world applications on the blockchain. I expect more to be coming soon.
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:35:46
I guess I dont see website for PAX yet
