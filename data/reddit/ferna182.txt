no. it is not. there's a couple of "auto switching pools" that mine whatever scrypt coin is the most profitable now, change it for BTC and you get paid in BTC. I'm doing that now on middlecoin.com and hashcows (hashco.ws). 2x 280x and 2x 290 averaging 0.024 BTC a day.

so, 100 grand for the next one? then finally 1M?
i don't know about you but even 100,000 doesn't sound *that* crazy anymore...

serious question: is there a study to support that fact? i mean the porn industry looks very healthy to me... and everywhere i look it seems like the porn industry is way bigger than we think it is...
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:56:11
a couple of things: first, i don't do 24/7 mining with the 290 rig... i also use it for gaming. and when i'm sleeping i use a quieter config because the fan is damn loud. so i could be squeezing a bit more out of it. 
about the profit thing... yeah it kinda depends on how much you pay for electricity and your intentions to turn it into fiat now or hoard coins for the future in hopes it jumps in value.
i always prefer to mine with gpu than to buy them because in a worst case scenario, you still have the hardware that can be repurposed for gaming so you can sell everything used and get some of the money back. is not like a gpu is worth 0 usd the second you walked out of the store, isn't it? on the other hand, if bitcoins for some reason disappear tomorrow, and you still didn't ROI your asic miners, then that's it. that's money you lost. same thing with buying coins... in a worst case scenario, that's money you lost forever.

But... How could that be? I am Satoshi Nakamoto...
@_date: 2014-01-13 13:36:45
guys... GPU mining for bitcoins is still relevant. you don't mine bitcoin directly though... you mine scrypt coins and exchange them for BTC. there are a number of different auto switching pools that automatically mine the most profitable scrypt coins and automatically exchanges them for BTC so you get paid on BTC. [Middlecoin]( and [Hash Cows]( are what i'm using now. I'm averaging 0.024 BTC a day with 2 R9 280x and 2 R9 290.

The Bitcoin comunity in a nutshell:
"Hey this old jerk from wallstreet says that bitcoin doesn't matter. It's a Pyramid scheme... it's a fad... it's just a bubble.... it's going to explode... it's just for idiots... it's monopoly money... let's all make fun of him for being an ignorant jerk. oh, wait a minute... what's that? dogecoin?A hahahahah that's just a joke man... it's a pyramid scheme... it's a fad... it's just a bubble... it's going to explode... it's just for idiots... it's monopoly money... hahahahahhaha "
but here's the thing... you point at the hypocrisy and you get attacked. nice work, guys!
I love bitcoin. i really do. but i hate the community so fucking much... i'm sorry but that's what it is.

aaahhh the good old shotgun prediction approach. yeah i see quite a lot of that in my country as well... they talk rubbish about pretty much anything possible. and then if eventually something comes true, they'll rub in your face "see?! i told you but you didn't listen!"

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:23:50
the "dip" isn't over... it'll most likely rebound to about 10k at some point after all the panic sellers disappear, but it will then crash again one more time before settling way below where we are right now for the next 2 or 3 years before the next run.
EDIT: that's just my opinion, of course, by looking at what happened in the past.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:52:06

there might be a workaround using apps though... they can't ban you from doing in-app purchases of credits for the Bread app that you can then exchange for Bitcoin...

There are browser extensions that look for coin miners and block them.

Bitcoin being down from 20k to 7k is apparently a "good thing" because it was much lower last year.
Meanwhile Dow Jones was 20k points last year and now it's sitting at around 24k and somehow that's different and it's a bad thing.
I also take my financial advice from memes and 12 year olds on the internet.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:37:44
I don't have the time, money or nerve for daytrading so i'm just waiting outside until it settles in whatever value the market wants it to settle, and then i'm going in again waiting for the next run in a couple of years.

"Before we continue, make sure you suscribe down below and give this video a thumbs up" 
How about no. How about I watch the video first and then decide if I like your video and your channel? or better yet, how about I dislike the video and close it immediately? god I hate channels that do this... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:25:19
Not only Dow Jones is down 4% vs more than 60% BTC, but Dow Jones (like bitcoin) was even lower a year before... Just like everyone likes to preach "zoom out" if you also "zoom out" on Dow Jones, it's up. (it used to be 20k points a year ago compared to 24k after the crash).
If y'all wanna be delusional, fine. go ahead... But at least try to use the same logic on everything.

the system is tweaked so that the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140. after a certain amount of bitcoins have been mined, the system will halve the amount of bitcoins a block will reward... it doesn't matter that 80% of the total bitcoins have already been mined, it'll get slower and harder to get the reminder every time.

How many times has been said, over and over again, only invest what you are whiling to lose. 
Also, Bitcoins are not a stock. Their value fluctuates rather quickly and that's a known fact. Who told you to buy? people that got rich trading stocks? your friends at school? I'm sorry but it's kinda your fault if you "invested" your money in something you didn't do minimal research for. 
and by the way... you haven't lost anything unless you trade them for less value. you still have the same amount of bitcoins you originally bought. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:37:32
who cares about that... the point is as normal people feel more confortable with the bitcoin concept they will eventually look for alternatives in accepting them without paying fees to paypal. It's a huge step forward.
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:22:32
yeah but mining at 48 mh/s is not even worth the noise of the card. at current difficulty you'd make around 0.01 BTC a week mining 24/7. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:20:09
hhmmm you might want to turn that off though... nvidias are actually not good at all for mining and you are wasting electricity. To give you an example, i have a couple of Radeon HD 7870 running at 420 mh/s EACH. not meant to be rude but this is like trying to put out a wild fire with a bucket of water. 
if you seriously want to get into mining, check the mining subreddit and switch to radeon.
you can calculate how much you can produce [here](

ah yeah... now that i think about it, i have a hell of a gaming rig. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 03:55:14
that's already happening. difficulty spiked the last couple of weeks. i was doing close to 4 LTC a day a few weeks ago and now i'm down to 1.8 a day... i switched because i predicted that this was going to happen so i wanted to rack up with as much ltc as i could before difficulty spiked... it was more of a bet than anything but if i were to trade all the ltc i mined since i switched, i'd get more btc than i would have if i didn't switched to ltc mining.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:14:41
how is it that every time i refresh the page, the counter goes back to 203 coins in the pot? oh yeah... because this is a scam
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:26:00
i knew i shouldn't have mentioned it... oh well whatever. faster confirmations is one thing... then there's the "mining" factor. for bitcoins, it seems it's not that difficult to produce a processor with a huge hashrate speed. they don't take that much space, they are cheap and they are very power efficient. having a significant amount of the total network hashrate is relatively easy (for someone who has the money to do it) compared to scrypt. since scrypt requires a huge amount of very fast memory (like GDDR5) producing "asic" like miners is not as trivial, or cheap, or power efficient as on bitcoin. getting a hold of a significant amount of the total network hashrate is actually quite difficult. you can still do it, of course, but that would be a massive headache. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 21:37:56
ok if you are happy making [0.01 BTC a week]( for 24/7 mining, and killing your card before you make up what you would get for just selling it used, then sure! go ahead...

You want to know who Satoshi is? I'll tell you who Satoshi is.
Who's been the one single company that made the most profits out of the whole cryptocurrency thing?... It's ATI. Their business was in jeopardy by the superior nVidia cards so they had to come up with a plan to make users actually want to buy ATI cards. If they are not as suited for gaming as nVidia, maybe they are suited for... other purposes. Enter Bitcoin.
And, just when their new business was beginning to be in jeopardy as well (because of more specialised hardware that does the job much MUCH better), they tweaked it, added memory requirements and called it Litecoin.
It's so freaking obvious.

@_date: 2013-04-21 05:11:26
what i mean is... by the time bfl starts shipping and the difficulty sky rockets, anyone wanting to get started in mining bitcoins will have to spend a pretty good amount of money to mine something... or wait in line to get their bfl miner. my bet is people will rather buy bitcoins instead of mining them... so as demand rises, the price will go up. 
nowadays, you can buy a bunch of gpus and start mining... but by the time bfl ships, gpus will lag waaaaay behind. so the only viable option to mine will be to order a bfl and wait til you get it. people from outside the us will get an even harder time trying to get them.

same thing with real money, isn't it? you can either save it yourself and be in charge of hiding it and prevent it from being stolen... or you can trust a bank with it so you don't have to worry about security, but you have to trust the bank wont take the money away from you.

well... some people think litecoin is facebook to bitcoin's myspace. and to be honest? i also believe that. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:18:02
but then... wouldn't the increase in difficulty to get them will make it more expensive to "produce" them (as you will need more electricity and more time) and thus increasing the exchange price of bitcoins? the calculations you made asume that the difficulty will go up but the price will not.
