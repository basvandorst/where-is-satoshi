I've made a simple tutorial, hope it helps!
1. Get [Geek Tool](
2. Create new "shell" widget. [How?](
3. Copy this code:
    curl -s ' | python -mjson.tool | grep "last" | tr -d '"' | tr -d 'last:' | tr -d ',' | tr -d ' '
4. Click '...' and paste it [How?](
5. Setup refresh interval to something bigger than 10 seconds, otherwise you might get banned
6. Setup font and color to your liking and enjoy!

And if you paste and execute the same code in terminal?

Sorry, you're right. I forgot I got it from App Store, not from the website.

Well, not true. Works for me fine (10.8.2)

What browser are you using? Works OK for me  It also depends on the performance of the computer, since it is using (quite modern) webaudio API.

I've made a bitcoin market sonification tool. It reads data over last few minutes of trades on Bitstamp and creates soundtrack based on recent developments of the market. Tell me what you think!
