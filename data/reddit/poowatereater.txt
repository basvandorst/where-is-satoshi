I'll try tonight.

Great update to the old coin ridding the roller coaster.  Can't wait for this to infiltrate other coin subreddits...
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:09:40
except its fee-less for the foreseeable future.
they want to grow their user base, and im assuming, than they'll slap on fees. hopefully a lot lower than coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:43:27
take litecoin outa that shit!
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:02:34
Not here to shill, But i remember reading about WISH being a coin that sets up smart contracts for real life events exactly like this. Pretty sure they have some type of working product too.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:19:39
This is amazing. Now if i could figure out why my credit card wont work on bitstamp....
keep getting an error. (I set my card up for Visa Verified, am I missing anything else?)
noted: I can buy on coinbase and refuse to give them anymore of my dollars.

I would love for the day to come that wallets/exchanges/sites/users have some type of safety wall that will pop up and say " hey, we notice your sending BTC to a LTC adress, this wont work! ABORT! "
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:38:14
this cant be stressed enough.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:51:03
i mean, it didn't say anywhere that " he will look into integrating cryptocurrencies into facebook services" He simply states that crypto has the ability to take power away from centralized institutions. Still i think its powerful he's come out talking about crypto
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:38:25
of course something like this would only be done in person. He lives in an upper middle class town so maybe he really doesnt care about the loss
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:04:51
it looks to be in stock color atm though... the color is beautiful but the wrap was god awful
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:08:00
meet him in person, apparently have a child thats in school with great grades.
if you are serious, use a new address to send and receive the payments. ONLY do it in person, and only if he has all the paper work(just like you would when buying a car with fiat)
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:12:16
This sounds like fun!
I've actually had the fun of looking for bitcoins at a music festival. A redditor in the subreddit associated with the festival had posted that he had done realllly well with bitcoin and hid 100 dollar paper wallets inside eggs inside a forest. I hunted all weekend for them and even ran into the guy twice.... Never ended up finding one. 
Here's to hoping you do something in the north jersey area!
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:28:33
i was just searching "mining" "crypto" and stumbled upon it. I dont have that kind of cash so i just read it and laughed a bit.
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:20:25
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:21:36
Where in nj is this? I'm in north jersey. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 23:57:45
So these hedge funds basically just have a fuck ton of money, pay some nerd to write a script/also to trade making pennies on each transaction? Doing thousands of transactions a second or something?
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:52:43
Did this delusional mo fucka just compare him preaching on reddit to what Martin Luther King Jr. did?!?!
This is fucking Golden!
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:45:48
Your statement doesn’t make sense. Fiat money isn’t a scam in the literal sense. 
The way it’s abused, created, controlled may look or feel like a scam though. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:08:42
Holy shit, if he’s not a troll account, will lose it
@_date: 2018-11-03 08:21:29
That will really help mass adoption...
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:30:54
@_date: 2018-11-14 01:06:45
Clearly fud. The up an coming fork is bringing all the scum bags out. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:48:10
Tether fud is so fucking real....
@_date: 2018-11-03 08:08:54
They would love this in @_date: 2018-11-20 21:16:47
Does the character look like a penis to anyone else?!
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:54:35
Mass adoption is truly here!
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:05:53
You sir, are delusional...
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:54:24
Ahhhh he’s trolling. It now makes sense. Fuck I thought he was a real life butter. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:32:32
You spelled hold wrong 
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:51:26
Wash trading doesn’t count at all. The flow of cash over the bitcoin network is a joke compared to visa... silly buttcoiners.
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:23:45
What was the purpose of your questions?
How do they prove that “fiat is a scam”?
I refuted your statement and you poised irrelevant questions....
@_date: 2019-01-22 05:08:53
It’s a loud space heater! Score! 
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:51:08
I didn't fall for anything. 
It's my opinion. Just like your opinion is that it was bullshit. Do you have proof it was bullshit? No.  Do I have proof it's a scam? No. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:39:44
That has nothing to do with mine and the others argument. I never once said religion wasn’t a scam...
Reddit is funny af sometimes :)
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:35:47
@_date: 2019-01-06 04:38:16
MARKET CAP MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. 
Usurped post with useless information
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:45:35
I was making jokes.....
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:00:26
How is a piece of paper, that has value in the eyes of billions, a scam?
Step back for a second and just think about how foolish what your saying is. 
I’m not saying the federal reserve is the proper way to control the country’s cash generation, but calm down. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:33:26
This. 
They are most likely not going to be overthrown any time soon. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:33:50
I tried salon out to see how invasive it was. They're using the coin hive script with fair warning of what their intentions are. CPU usage was at 100% and made browsing terrible. 
I'm not shilling, but check out the oyster pearl team out. They plan on tackling this problem in a multifaceted way. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:29:52
He probably should have read it. Very well written short article. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:31:15
Catching up with a buddy who just went to that festival! 
he thinks crypto is a bubble. He's an other-wise really smart kid.....
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:30:34
I read a lengthy post a while back explaining that it doesn't matter who tries to get into the specialized asic mining industry. Bitmain will always remain the top dog. 
Bitmain is so far ahead in the race for domination over the market that if anyone tries to compete, they will not be able to do it cheaper or faster than bitmain. 
Edit: getting down voted for talking about the topic in a constructive way. Really love Reddit sometimes. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:25:08
this literally blew my mind.......
didn't even know something like this existed...
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:54:17
I never said they were complex chipsets. The sheer over head and cost to start up a custom asic production is staggering. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:26:19
No problem! 
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:17:46
Ltc was never a fork of bitcoin. A lot of people seem to think this. 
It has its own genesis chain 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:31:50
Good analogy of what bitmain does with their inventory...
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:20:48
I find it funny that it's called bitcoin CASH. the whole idea of crypto is to get away from "cash" / "fiat".... so why call it such 
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:27:58
We have gold as a store of value because of its rarity and beauty. 
By what your saying is we have bitcoin cash because it's tied to something of value....  that makes 0 sense. 
Crypto is meant to replace fiats. 
I just find the name of bitcoin cash to be stupid as it's not cash. It's crypto currency. It's 1's and 0's on a network. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:41:43
Holding since sept 2017. Not long but oh well. We'll see how it goes in five year
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:03:17
I rather employ a lot of employed than just 300. 
Seems like the spread of wealth there is disgustingly off. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:44:08
State? City? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:20:26
These graphs and comparisons are 100% useless as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:47:05
You guys do realize that “fiat crashing” will not bring good things to whatever country you live in ?!
The government around you will start to buckle under pressure. You won’t be able to use your internet money to buy physical goods. 
This subreddit is filled with cult like mentality, shit is getting out of hand.
