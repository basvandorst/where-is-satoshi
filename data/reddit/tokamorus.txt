Some consider bitcoin a shit coin, too, and if you're measuring against specific criteria it is, but it's still king, I'd argue, because it's the one that's familiar. It is to the cryptocurrency universe what coke is to soda, meaning many people ask for a coke even though they want sprite (I.e. Will you get me a coke? Sure, what kind of coke do you want?).
When people, who aren't particularly knowledgeable on cryptocurrencies, speak of cryptocurrencies they tend to reference BTC as an umbrella term for any cryptocurrency. 
So even though BTC isn't the best suited for this use or that, and others are far better suited, BTC still wears the crown because it's the term the uninitiated relate to when the subject of cryptocurrencies arises. I imagine that'll change over time, and other currencies will out perform BTC in the long run, but I think it'll always be the "gold standard" all other coins are measured against for the foreseeable future.

I'm not sure why Linux would be necessary either. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the issue. 
You have a cell phone, with BTC on in, correct?
If so put your wallet of choice on a usb drive then send the balance to that wallet.
What am I missing?

Why not just move it to a usb drive?

I love this reaction! Every time I hear it I imagine someone back in the day saying "I don't know about this whole telephone thing. Seems like something for people who have more money than sense."
Then I buy more BTC, knowing how valuable it will become over the next decade.

Significantly more valuable than it currently is. ��
I'm going to overlook the feeling that you're being sarcastic, and point out everything I say is pure speculation, as I'm not an expert or a prophet, and have a little fun. 
Considering it's increased to 5x its value so far his year, and the year is only almost 3/4 past, it seems if it continues the pattern it's shown it will likely end this year around 7k. 
But next year, as more people get on board, similar to how it behaved this year, I imagine we can reasonably expect it to jump in increments of 2k per spike, while likely bottomIng out after falling about $500 from the new al time high it sets.
So going on that, next year's end should see a price of about $20K. 
Following that pattern, and assuming the dollar (American) doesn't completely crash, 12 years from now it should be roughly $250K each. 
If the dollar does crash, it'll be worth billions, but then again, so would a loaf of bread since anything worthless can't be traded for value.
Also, remember I said this is speculation for fun and I'm no expert or prophet. ��
