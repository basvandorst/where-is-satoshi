see this. It's a hash to gHz conversion for many CPUs and GPUs
e.g. top line shows 15Mhz Hash is what you get from 4Gz intel i5 Quad 
i.e. 15Mhz Hash = 16 Ghz Processor speed.
Conversion roughly 1 hash for 1000 CPU/GPH Hz

Who else does the encryption? That's the point of the 25 bitcoins released every 10 minutes. They pay for the encryption.

True, but you confuse hashcash and Ghz. 250,000 petaflops is the equivalent of 16 billion PCs. You are orders of magnitude out.

Seems Bitcoin Wiki must be as confused as me also. They say the same thing.
Bitcoin relies on the fact that no single entity can control most of the CPU power on the network for any significant length of time, since, if they could, they would be able to extend any branch of the tree they chose, and faster than any other branch can be extended, making it the longest branch, and then permanently controlling which transactions appear in it.

Okay. I got the number wrong. But the idea is correct. There are 7200 Bitcoins given away to miners per day. Suppose their machines run 24/7. Then Cost per machine is $1.5 per day. About 500,000 miners could be supported in long run equilibrium.  Suppose miners run Quad core @ 4GHz . Equates to computing power of 8 Petaflops. To destroy Bitcoin you need at least this processing power. Which puts you in top 5 worldwide computers.

ttps://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate is current hash rate which yesterday was 24 million Ghz = about 1.5 million miners running 4Ghz Quad Cores, not quite the 250,000 Petaflops of oregono which would be 250 billion Ghz!!
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:03:09
That seems a little big. If each miner has 16 Ghz, 250,000 peta = 250*10^9 Ghz, then you imply 16 billion bitminers? Seems a lots of people to me.

megahashes/s	20-bit	clock (boost)	model	core
14.9 Mh/s	0.067s	oc 4.4Ghz (4.4Ghz)	i5 3570k	mmx std 1x2
It's pretty simple stuff really.

This is from bitcoin.org ,which uses the wrod cryptography, which means encryption.
Who created Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called "crypto-currency", which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a central authority.
