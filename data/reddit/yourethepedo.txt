Sssshhhhhhhh, just let the free market do its thing. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 06:00:05
Are you interested in bridges?
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:35:50
Please film it and post it to YouTube so we can all enjoy your protest.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:18:35
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:11:08
You're right. Just ignore the problems presented by bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:17:36
Sorry to interrupt the cult meeting.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:23:44
What laws?
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:01:21
You're not investing, you're just being taken advantage of.
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:59:57
Do exactly what they want! That'll show 'em!
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:26:02
No one knows why all the bitcoins are falling at once.
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:54:46
*the backbone of the network
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:36:51
No one learns anything though, the cult of bitcoin has taken over.
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:27:45
Satoshi wrote the bitcoin protocol as a proof-of-concept. He never intended it to become a widespread 'currency'. Read the research paper and his posts on the forum and you'll see him distancing himself from his research as fanatical libertarians take over.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:42:38
Get ready for some epic hand-waving.
@_date: 2014-03-25 08:15:55
I paid for my vpn using a prepaid visa card I bought with cash. Neither of those transactions can ever be traced to me.
You paid for your vpn with bitcoin. That transaction is recorded forever. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:33:47
Woah, no paperwork or accountants? Totally can't do that without a convoluted public transaction system.
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:29:52
Their fries are pretty ordinary tbh. No chain in Australia has figured out how to double-fry chips, Belgian-style, yet.
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:59:33


@_date: 2014-02-17 04:54:27
Apparently you already did the research though?
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:03:55
Bitcoiners will never go for this.
The Moon is more of a dogecoin idea anyway...
@_date: 2014-04-05 12:43:43
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:02:18
Literally nothing. That's one of the many failings of an unregulated financial market.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:44:13
People are laughing because mtgox was known to have major issues, as is the bitcoin protocol. There is plenty of information for those willing to educate themselves. Some people would rather play captain of industry in an unregulated financial market though.
This subreddit is therefore a rich source of schadenfreude.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:08:45
There is literally nothing stopping, and no way to recognise, an exchange from manipulating the market in order to make money. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 02:59:58
It's like gold except anyone anywhere can just make their own version of gold with the exact same properties.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:00:18
So what do you plan to do when you forget your private key?
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:14:33
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:44:09
Why did you change it to the Thai Baht symbol?
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:00:07
It is. True Believers well say anything to get more people to join their cult though.
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:11:51
You're forgetting that in this FYGM ecosystem created by bitcoin, it's actually in your best interest to destroy bitcoins owned by others. In this way, you increase the value of your own.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:00:21
Bitcoiners are notoriously easy to scam, so yes, this will happen again and again.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:56:33
Your tears mean more than words ever could.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:03:31
No point arguing with a True Believer, dude.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:04:09
It's only 20% of the world and a constant source of bad news. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:07:31
A bailout is a bailout. The free market requires those that can't compete to fail. End of story.
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:58:34
They usually break the most important rule here at which is Pump Above All. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:14:56
You'd attract more and more competent developers with actual money.
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:46:01
Mining hasn't been profitable for a long time.
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:30:05
You are insane.
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:07:56
Bitcoin is already incredibly concentrated, far more than actual currencies.
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:51:58




@_date: 2014-02-17 08:06:11
Is this the sum total of your contribution or is there something much larger incoming?
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:15:10
The more people sell, the lower it goes. If you have actual money in Bitcoin you should try to get out while you still can.
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:03:26
Anyone dumb/gullible enough to buy into bitcoin has already done so.
Please stop harassing people.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:54:43
So close.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:04:53
Whatever you do, do not take advice on bitcoin from the cultists here.
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:10:27
Literally cash...but with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-09 11:39:26
You know that symbol is more commonly used to denote That baht, right?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:17:02
And there's probably more than a few suckers who will gamble real money here just because they see a Bitcoin logo!
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:37:19
Things that bitcoiners say every day?
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:27:47
I'm picturing you sitting at the dinner table between your parents, wearing a suit four sizes too big.
Am I close?
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:39:11
What law was broken?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:57:02
I'd listen to your friend if I was you.
@_date: 2014-01-18 01:54:47
What a colossal waste of our planet's finite resources.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:31:23
Mining is already unprofitable.
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:15:52
Is the entire protest literally two people?
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:57:55
I like it. dogecoin is fun.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:54:48
Bitcoiners by definition are easily led.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:18:03
Bitcoin solves a problem most people just don't have. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:38:04
Use BitPay. Don't forget about dogecoin though, it's the fastest growing digital currency and has a truly amazing community!
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:32:31
Banks are pretty easy to use and beneficial to the vast majority of people. Not sure what you're doing wrong to have had a difficult time.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:02:39
I just ask for their bank account number and send it through the banking system. It's free, instant, and they will reverse it if I fat-finger the account number.

A poorly built and insecure bitcoin service?
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:08:50
But begging is an integral part of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:42:18
What about a hype-meter?
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:57:31
I don't think you quite 'get' bitcoin. What you describe as "bad news" is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:00:02
Please don't throw your money away.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:57:50
How long do you expect people to wait at the merch table for confirmations?

How will your petition site not be useless?
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:18:16
It doesn't necessarily mean permissible, just pretty easy to get away with.
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:56:07
It's a metaphor.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:05:58
Downvoted. Please ensure any lines you draw on a chart are going up next time.
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:04:14
It is unsafe though.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:23:20
This is because the entire bitcoin market is the same group of people trading between themselves.
@_date: 2014-03-15 05:19:11
Are you against modern banking corporations or the concept of banks altogether?
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:46:11
Instability is stability! Why didn't we all realise sooner?
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:08:04
Bitcoin sucks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:16:05
What law was broken in this case?
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:36:06
As a NAB customer, finally. This is good decision.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:07:45
Why are these experts spreading FUD?
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:54:02
Welcome to the cult of r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:11:18
The fact that they operate in a free market allows them to choose who they do business with.
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:38:53
Hopefully they won't outright ban it and instead will ration out bad news for the foreseeable future, thus ensuring the longevity of bitcoin lols.
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:54:39
Are there any bitcoin enterprises that aren't scams?
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:24:50
So dumb.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:42:57


-- every cult member ever.
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:06:48
It's a good thing there aren't any tricksy banksters around to reverse your transaction!
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:48:30
Someone call CPS please, this is sad.
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:47:59
I think -$1,000 is more likely.
@_date: 2014-01-27 08:06:29
So? Both are bad.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:09:13


That's ok. Some of us have vision, some don't.
@_date: 2014-01-20 13:29:56
WTF is a school in a small rural Thai village going to do with bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:55:39
The smart people have been slowly selling their portfolios over an extended time period to maximise their returns.
Depending on how many bitcoins you have it may not be too late to adopt this approach.
@_date: 2014-04-12 08:04:10


Truly you are a bitcoiner.
@_date: 2014-02-06 08:19:55
No I mean which bitcoin? There are lots of different types.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:09:15
Remind me how this is superior to regular money?
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:02:06
"Room for growth"
"Potential for improvement"
"Renevator's delight"
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:26:40
Everything bad is actually good!
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:53:24

@_date: 2014-04-25 14:25:25

You're a real ideas guy!
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:27:31
All the exchanges are plummeting, very quickly as well.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:07:43
Unfairly? Welcome to the free market you bitcoiners love so much.
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:34:42
Dude just start a distributed decentralised subreddit.
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:17:56
The dumbest plan ever.
This being bitcoin though, wouldn't surprise me...
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:09:34
The flaws and problems inherent in the bitcoin protocol are well-documented and not a matter of opinion.
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:34:14
This is actually the only way we're all going to make money with this.
The more people we can attract, the higher the cost for a scarce asset, the more money we all make.
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:15:15
Be your own bank!
@_date: 2014-01-20 13:33:53
Sometimes people ask me how many albums I own, or how many books, or computer games etc. It's a perfectly reasonable questions. 
If they were asking how much you earned in a year or what your bank balance is, well that's different.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:59:18
Hours much do you trust complete strangers with your money?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:56:20

Logic, reason, dignity.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:14:23
There's literally no way of knowing if multiple pools are colluding anyway. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:21:44
The money you gave him?
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:55:39
lol. Now you learn an important lesson about financial regulation.
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:35:20
That price is meaningless. No one will give you $1000 for a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:22:57
Bitcoin exchanges can do whatever they want as they are unregulated. This is good for bitcoin because...
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:57:03
Please use a more reputable exchange like BitStamp where the price is higher.
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:23:59
You'll never convince the True Believers. This place is a fucking cult.
@_date: 2014-01-24 07:43:02
Downvoted for not promoting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:26:47
There's literally no way to tell.
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:01:24
What stage of a bitcoin company life-cycle is the bank run?
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:05:14
Don't worry, it'll start working soon.
@_date: 2014-04-15 06:39:12
You seem like just another bitcoiner with an idea and no clue on how to implement it.
Ideas are easy, actually doing it is hard. Come back when you actually have something tangible.
@_date: 2014-01-28 12:48:10
This is Bitcoin's dirty secret. There is no easy way to cash out.
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:28:30
Seems par for the course for bitcoin though.
@_date: 2014-04-14 04:16:49
They're private corporations, they can refuse to do business with people for arbitrary reasons. 
Why do you hate the free market?
@_date: 2014-04-12 08:09:43
Keep the lols coming man.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:36:43
Obscurity in financial data I see as a drawback. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:15:24
One day you guys will realise bitcoin solves a problem most people simply don't have. No amount of shiny videos and evangelists will convince people.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:04:39
Dogecoin has captured the community's spirit and imagination! People love it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:53:53
In light of the ineffable structural issues related to Bitcoin, you should sell everything you have asap.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:48:18
It's literally just an offline backup.
@_date: 2014-04-27 01:18:20
do you not understand figures of speech?
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:13:09
Exactly what laws did he break?
@_date: 2014-01-20 13:32:04
Only a Bitcoiner would take joy in others misery like this.
@_date: 2014-04-18 03:28:47
Why don't we put all the 'ideas' people on r/bitcoin have into a blockchain and then delete each private key so no one has to hear them again.
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:12:03
Why are you so afraid of the free market?
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:21:53
Bitcoin is the most efficient way to turn money into lols.
@_date: 2014-04-14 03:26:29
They're a private corporation, they can refuse to do business with anyone they like 
In this case, they've deemed the accounts of people dealing with bitcoin to be too risky. 
This is welcome news for their customers.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:12:04
Gee, you think?
@_date: 2014-04-05 12:24:08
Most businesses that 'accept' bitcoin are too smart to touch any.  Hence, they let another company take the risk and loses. 
Capitalism means knowing there are thousands of idiots who will shop at your store if you use bitpay and have a bitcoin sticker. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:08:47
You can't gamble with bitcoin though, only real money. They'd probably still make money if they gave food and accommodation away tbh.
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:31:19
Whatever you do, please don't take advice from the cult of r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:39:57
The most likely explanation is that he lost the private keys.
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:57:58
Do it. They won't miss your business.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:29:19
You have a gambling problem.
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:34:20
Why use bitcoin for this instead of any other cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2014-01-22 10:30:41
Nasty people like you are why so many are switching to dogecoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:54:34
You know they're desperate when they'll even take bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:19:10
So sick of these actual money trolls.
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:27:36
Yeah! Why don't they want to make less money?!
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:55:33
How do you plan on scamming your customers?
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:17:34
It's bitcoin, just tag him as a scammer and pretend you never had the money in the first place.
If it makes you feel better, your money was lost as soon as you bought the bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:11:02
A fool and their money are soon parted.
@_date: 2014-04-14 03:35:21
Bitcoin is a very high-risk investment. Bitcoin businesses and customers have a habit of losing all their money.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:55:28
Please don't throw your money away.
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:45:06
Actual heaters cost less.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:01:18
Pogs for libertarians
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:55:50
Whatever you do, don't take any advice from the cult of r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:39:07
They obviously aren't smart enough.
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:50:51
The more money you have, the more important your judgement.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:44:55


Based on what though? $5000 is far more plausible. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:00:41
Banks closing bitcoiner accounts will never not be funny. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 11:51:34
What's the point? It will be inaccurate before it reaches the newsstands.
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:45:04
lol. your "money" is gone.
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:17:29
Put lead in the water supply perhaps?
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:18:25
I'm talking about bitcoin, not Bitcoin. They have different meanings.
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:09:17
Your problem is that, much like a cult initiate, you see your friends and family as potential converts. They likely think of you as creepy and weird and want nothing to do with what you're trying to sell them.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:32:06
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:50:05
The inventor distanced himself from his research after claiming anyone who put real money into bitcoin was very foolish.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:12:30
It's foolish to assume mining pools aren't already colluding. There is literally no way to know for sure.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:01:10
So you're saying you don't trust Magic the Gathering Online Exchange?
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:09:02
You know you're in a cult when everyone (even children) start looking like potential converts.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:01:34
Had anyone on this sub even read the original research paper? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:16:58
Bitcoiners are always complaining about everyone laughing at them and their cult; it's pretty funny.
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:00:51
I buy more with every paycheck, as much as I can afford.
By the end of the year, $5,000 easy, probably more.
@_date: 2014-01-21 11:25:19
What is menulog supposed to do with the bitcoins they get? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:48:57
im the she lock Holmes.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:38:53
log chart lol.
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:46:59


What law did they break?
Everyone with bitcoin held at Magic the Gathering Online Exchange gave them up willingly. 
You have no recourse, your money is gone.
Though I'm sure you've heard that before.
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:08:33
All signs point to Yes.
@_date: 2014-04-26 08:13:43
Stop spreading FUD please.
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:49:47
This is truly the subreddit that keeps on giving.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:54:47


@_date: 2014-04-18 14:24:05
Bitcoiners aren't very smart.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:03:38
Why stop at 5?
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:26:18

You're the reason people mock bitcoin enthusiasts.
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:13:07
Bitcoin is a really, really elaborate practical joke, isn't it? 
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:44:36
You get to pretend to be an early adopter without actually ever touching bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:35:03
I have 3.6, always looking for more though. I plan on keeping them until their values appreciates sufficiently, then I will sell them.

The collapse of popular Bitcoin exchange Magic the Gathering Online Exchange is but a taste of things to come.

It's bound to happen with any flawed protocol.

Why would a corporation just give away their money?
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:36:10
This is good for bitcoin because...

Trick question: you can't put a price on the moon.
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:46:58
Keep buying!  You can stop when I'm done selling.
@_date: 2014-02-09 12:05:55




@_date: 2014-03-13 08:46:36
This is pretty petulant, even for a bitcoiner.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:32:48
Everyone liked them when they were $150 higher than the other exchanges?
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:16:26
Actually all you need is &gt;51% of the hashing power to do this, and literally no one would know. In fact there's really no reason to assume it's not being done now.

Ask them what they do with their bitcoins.
Alternatively, ask them who they're laundering money for.
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:50:18
More evidence that Bitcoin is the long story of how libertarians discover why financial regulations are necessary.

Anyone with any intelligence got out months ago. 
Don't worry though, bitcoin is still the future of money! Coincidentally I have some for sale! If you truly believe you need to buy more.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:22:53
No one outside the small bitcoin community cares about or is interested in bitcoin though. Bitcoin solves a problem most people don't have, so it will never be 'frictionless'.
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:09:29
A bailout? no thanks, that will only harm bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:39:09
Lost keys? That's even funnier. Your life savings essentially has a password. That is a terrible 'feature'. 
If I lose access to my bank account I just take my passport to my local branch and they reset it for me.  I will never 'lose' access to my money.

Which bitcoin are you talking about though? They're all different with their own pros and cons.

You voluntarily gave it to them and they absolutely made no guarantee to give it back.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:14:16
My bank does international transfers for free as well.
So what if they record everything? That offers security. Bitcoin also records everything.

If you have less money now than yesterday, bitcoin is working.

If you can continue to find new people to buy bitcoin, the price will keep climbing. As soon as a decent percentage decide to sell though, that's it, game over, 90% of bitcoiners will lose everything.

Anyone who has been paying attention knows it's only a matter of time. Regardless, the True Believers will bury this.

I think there's a few places which say they take bitcoins then laugh at you when you try to pay with them.
@_date: 2014-01-18 15:04:32
They run extensive "testing" before selling them usually.

My bank does transfers instantly for free. And there's pretty much zero percent chance they'll send money to someone twice and then declare bankruptcy.

That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

I'm not aware of any companies accepting bitcoin. They all seem to have arrangements with intermediaries who instantly convert the Bitcoin to cash.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:47:20
Put down the kool aid. Bitcoin is an interesting proof-of-concept, that's it though. It was never meant for widespread adoption.

I guess you guys didn't grasp my point.
You're ostensibly looking for increased privacy with a vpn. Paying for it with bitcoin undermines your goal.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:40:49
It's mostly due to people switching to other bitcoins like Dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:17:10
This is just a symptom of an incredibly shallow market.

fucking lol
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:30:19
That's because Fuck You, Got Mine is the libertarian and therefore the de facto bitcoin ethos.

Anyone who claims bitcoin has no fees is lying.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:54:13
Of course it does. Once people start withdrawing, the price plummets very very quickly.

This is a good way to look at spending real money on bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:54:09

At least 6 months. There is a massive waiting list. Mt Gox is limited to 6000 cash transfers per month. Across alll users.
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:40:24
Which ones take dogecoin though?
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:57:09
This is why people mock bitcoin. You make dogecoin look better and better every day.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:27:09
The move to dogecoin is already well under way. Only a fool would stick with bitcoin at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-27 07:09:14
Are they doing that with bitcoin though? Or are they trading bitcoin for USD?

I jumped ship to dogecoin a few days ago. It's the only cryptocurrency that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:24:08
Literally using charities to further your own agenda. You're pretty low.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:57:16
I moved 50% of my crypto portfolio into dogecoin and liquidated the rest for the time being, most of my friends did something similar.
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:46:55
Dogecoin is the fastest growing and coolest crypto currency. People like you are afraid because you don't understand dogecoin.

Bitcoin users are inherently gullible which is why these schemes are so profitable.
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:51:10
It's a redundant crypto currency. Most crypto enthusiasts have moved to dogecoin though, the fastest growing and coolest online currency.
