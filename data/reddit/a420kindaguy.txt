They have a multitude of historical data to analyse and apply now, the ability to forecast is therefore significant.. but of course these are only models and nothing is certain

No way, that would be silly

No this is a standard transaction fee, be glad it isn’t percentage based.

There have been forecasting models that have shown very high correlation to price movement over the past few years.. wether this is a coincident, who knows

Yes buy BTC. And you wouldn’t be buying and selling that regularly bc of transaction fees amongst other things.

Because they offer a more liquid market without the transactional flaws of BTC.  It’s possible that the institutional investors that are negative on bitcoin’s prospects (and there’s no shortage of those) may use the futures markets to put money behind their conviction. It’s much easier to sell a futures contract with a lower-than-market price than it is to actually short bitcoin. These investors may well send signals to the actual bitcoin market that sends prices tumbling.

You have to make more transactions or hold your position a little while, it’s their security measure.
