None of these money launderers like the Fed, central bankers, and corrupt governments cared one bit about humanity. The people are pissed and don’t need to play nice.

Those people are delirious.

Doesn’t CashApp have a higher exchange rate (up to $80-$100 more)?
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:38:57
The apps are simply to confirm on the device which cryptocurrency wallet you are sending/receiving from.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:16:26
Just got some more. Not gonna regret this
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:55:36
Does elevated by over $100 seem a bit of a stretch?
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:25:52
Cool I'll sell then
@_date: 2019-07-02 05:25:09
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:02:23
I think so. I just don’t know how secure it would be though being that hardware wallets are the necessity. Definitely will get more people onboard.
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:48:12
When you sell Bitcoin to the Cash Card is there tax implications? If so do they send a 1099?
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:45:59
Thanks guys

I believe that was it for now. I’m pretty sure they will have more hearings in the next 30 days or so.

Will there ever be a scenario where China doesn’t have the most miners to sort of balance things out. I guess what I’m getting at is the possibility of a 51% attack would be even less if they didn’t have the most miners. Correct?
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:59:55
So CashApp fees are slightly cheaper than Coinbase but the exchange rates are higher?
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:04:32
Yeah I just started doing this a month ago. Not exactly every week but definitely 2-3 separate purchases spread out over a month. This month only made one purchase but I plan on doing a couple of more. ����
@_date: 2019-03-22 03:50:33
Is $25 per week considered too small?

What are crypto regulations like in Venezuela? I heard there’s limits and so forth.

Literally having to argue with someone on another forum who just said this:
“End of the day, if bitcoin succeeds, majority of the people who did not invest early will end up super poor, despite having money. Sorry, being an engineer in computer science, I have to protect the common people by fighting against such schemes. Not take advantage of their ignorance and make money out of it.
Its a good idea to put your faith in a mathematical framework. But bitcoin ain't it. Like I said, block chain is the future. But not in this form of implementation. In its current form it will ruin the lives of many, while protecting too few a people.”
Anyone have a good response? I’m tired of arguing with stupid

I noticed that too. Not really impressed with that app. Could use some improvements.

Hmmm. Yeah that's a good one.

Just as the S&amp;P 500 record close ironically
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:03:08
If the writer of the story is a “contributor” then it’s no different than you or I writing a blog, and then slapping the Forbes logo on it. Very misleading and people think it comes from an actual Forbes writer, when it’s really not.
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:18:53
Because maybe he and the Fed have been running the most successful Ponzi scheme for years and doesn’t want it to end?

It won’t be a problem for miners in that country to move to another where it’s sustainable. If anything it will become more decentralized too.
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:36:04
Hypothetically speaking how fast could it drop back down to just under $4,000? I was actually enjoying accumulating in that range. ��

I don’t use Lolli and Apple disabled the browser extension anyway for Safari. Pei on the other hand doesn’t even work with browsers.
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:21:06
Forbes contributors like Billy Bambrough LOVE to use click bait words like "blow to Bitcoin". Pay zero attention to them
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:34:02
I think Pei is actually better than Lolli in the BTC back game. I’m hearing though Lolli has an app coming out soon to do the same with every day purchases.
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:58:16
It’s available on Coinbase. As part of when it forked I received a small amount but it does not allow you to trade it on Coinbase for anything else.

A lot of good news this morning. ����

I have about the same amount too and even i bought a Ledger Nano S wallet. Might as well do it right.
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:32:41
I’m trying to figure out a way to get rid of the small amount i have on Coinbase so I can switch it for BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:34:02
So good. ����
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:00:06
I’d be shocked if it went back below 4k ever again.
@_date: 2019-05-20 02:11:52
I thought it was good because the first story was about bank money laundering, and it ended with the Bitcoin segment.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:32:45
Nothing wrong with doing DCA and dip buys along the way. Right?
