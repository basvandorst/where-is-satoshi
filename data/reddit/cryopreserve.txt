Halvening has usually meant rise preceding the halvening and after halvening also

Can we have some serious discussion about BAKKT, to me it seems more promising. 
And what are the chances for it getting approved? 
For me chances are very high due to decision being under CFTC

LOL, its working fine mate

It doesn’t convert BTC into altcoin, it is more like several people put in their BTC in a bag and then are delivered equivalent amount minus the fees
Even masternode operator can’t know who’s who and can’t steel your BTC
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:11:48
LOL you are burning more than the sun
It’s out there buddy, they have released it
ACCEPT THIS FACT

Should have used Breeze Tumblebit 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:13:15
Its still a good start, corporate and institutional investors would precede the herd 
@_date: 2018-10-02 02:34:55
Exactly !
@_date: 2018-10-20 15:08:54
Just want to add, they are not just an altcoin, but a real world BAAS business also.

Great Article !

Well, one case i can think of is that, suppose you receive BTC from silk road or any other darknet market wallet, then you can get in trouble when FBI or any other agency investigates any wrong doing. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:18:55
Things are getting pretty interesting !
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:19:23
True and YUGE it is
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:45:42
The github of Breeze has suddenly lit up, and as per roadmap it should be released within this month, i am dead sure that they would release Tumblebit in coming days.
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:16:16
For the past one year it happened in reverse though 
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:41:19
ROFL !
@_date: 2018-11-13 12:26:15
I am not a Bitmain fan, i supported BTC over BCASH
But is that a right comparison?
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:47:25
Seeing STRATIS logo on r/BITCOIN
I thought that Tumblebit has been released on Mainnet 
( going to be released in Q1, Q2 2018 )
@_date: 2018-11-03 10:23:20
Can you please compare this with Tumblebit ?
@_date: 2018-07-31 02:57:19
They understand how this world works better than most people and use it to their advantage 
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:10:37
Doesn't the SEC people like money, do you think that they don't own BITCOIN ?
And If ETFs are backed by real BTC, whether 25 or 50, wouldn't it lead to purchase of real BTC and create demand supply imbalance, opposite to FUTURES which were cash settled and not real BTC ?
