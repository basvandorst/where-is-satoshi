Any guesses as to what effect the etf would have on the price?

I like how the arguments used against bitcoin by the public is now the same argument used to discredit alts.

Trading isn't a skill, trading is gambling. You can't time or predict the market.

That being said, If I wanted to double down on a specific chain by moving all of my funds from fork A to fork B would this effectively double my funds?

I'm sorry if I didn't clarify, English isn't my first language. I'm not really talking about the compatibility with Trezor, 
rather what happens when bitcoin forks with our current bitcoin holdings? Which chain do they assume?

This is perfect, thanks.

That being said if I have funds on Fork A and Fork B, how can I send all of my funds to support to dominant fork?
@_date: 2016-10-15 02:07:33
Will I have to do anything with my bitcoin to designate them as Fork A or Fork B and resend them to the trezor?
