Okay, gotcha.. that makes a bit more sense now.  I was confused as to why you were suggesting we do one method but not the reverse of it.  Thanks for the clarification.
As a side note, I've got no clue why you have -2 downvotes at the moment, regardless of your missing comma that was still a valid point you raised.

Yes, definitely!  This is why I'm excited to start this project.  Before I started doing internet startups, I worked for one of the largest financial corporations in the world.
I worked in the commercial sector and would often conduct training courses and seminars on the proper semantics and logistics of both Money Service Businesses AND AML Anti-Money Laundering training.  I've even worked with the federal government on AML training when our company was outsourced to provide basics/training for various federal departments.
I'm excited to combine my love of the online business industry WITH my financial roots in MSB/AML

To help curb the insane amount of I dotting and T crossing in the MSB industry, we're going to place various limits on transactions.  The beginning stages of our business will be very heavily limited and we will decrease those limits as we gain momentum.
Limits that will be here, at least in the beginning stages:
*  **Minimum BTC Withdraw/Transfer Amount** - This will help prevent having A LOT of tiny little $10-$20 transactions.  Whether the transaction is for $10 or $500, it will still take almost the same amount of time to process and report, so not allowing tiny transactions in the beginning will be a big help.
*  **Maximum Number Of Transactions** - In the beginning, we don't want someone who receives BTC payments throughout the day, maybe from a website or online service, and then requesting withdraws/transfers every time they get paid.  Rather than processing 3 transactions a day for somebody, we will try and encourage them to do just one larger weekly or monthly transaction.
*  **Accounting And Taxes** - I spoke with my accountant not too long ago about this idea.  He is a CPA/MBA/JD who used to work for the Secret Service in their white collar fraud department.  If anybody can keep proper reporting while filtering out money laundering, then this is the guy!
Again, there's obviously A LOT to work on and A LOT of factors to take into consideration.  I just want those of you reading this to realize we're not just going to put this out there, test the waters, and then disappear when it gets too hard.  
Between my business partner and I, plus the team we have used in the past (programmers, marketers, accountant, legal counsel, etc..) we are going to be in this for the long haul.

Oh no, I didn't take it as being negative at all.  I'm actually glad you posted what you did as it gave me the opportunity to reassure others reading this thread that we've got a very qualified team and are going to grow at a pace that lets us learn along the way.
And thank you for the kind words!

So far there have been a few replies, mostly in favor.. but surprisingly I have received about 15 private messages in favor of the idea and asking to be known if/when something like this is ready.
I didn't expect this much of a response so quickly, even though it's only a few dozen replies.
We're going to push the idea through.  It won't cost much to at least set up a Beta version of the site (domain, hosting, minimal programming).  
We will have the Beta version up this weekend.  I plan on maybe just letting those who private messaged me try it out first, this way it won't seem like we're spamming and we can work out any issues right away with people who are willing to test it knowing very well that it's a new service.
Please keep the ideas and suggestions coming, whether in this thread or via private message.  I'll keep this thread updated!

So basically we should NOT allow users to send us 'cash' transfers in exchange for bitcoins but the original idea of turning their bitcoins into cash might be okay?
