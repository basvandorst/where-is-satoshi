Well, when the biggest miners is for BCH, I guess this is what they do :/
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:20:38
Don’t worry bro they’re rebranding and launching again. Just taking a little while ��
@_date: 2018-10-21 06:02:24
Purse.io you can get large discounts for amazon items in BTC or BCH. It’s basically an exchange where you submit orders + a discount rate and they get filled by bitcoin buyers. You can get 15% discounts filled in minutes usually 
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:55:43
Exactly. You don’t KNOW that Bitcoin Cash can’t scale on chain. Just like you don’t KNOW that lightning network will be fully successful and deliver on everything it’s promised. You don’t KNOW anything, that’s how investing works buddy. Don’t be so dismissive, there are a lot of very smart people working on LN and there are a lot of very smart people working on Big Blocks.

I’m shorting this shit on bitmex, something I never do. Traders will sell the news &amp; the fork is going to be really ugly
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:51:00
No, they are fully revelant.
You want to spend $10 of BTC + $1 tx fee.
If you use old BTC that has 2x'ed, you are required to pay taxes on $5.50.
If you buy BTC and immediately use it, then you pay taxes on $0 appreciation.
Also, it doesn't have to *literally* be the last coin in is the last coin out. It's 100% for accounting, doesn't matter what coin is actually spent. All industries use this for accounting purposes.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:52:20
How can you argue “store of value” when it’s so damn volatile? It’s always going to be volitile when no one spend their BTC. You need usecases and liquidity 
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:16:23
Can you seriously not send 100 sats through a really well connected node like BitRefill? Jeez...
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:54:03
So Coinbase and many more exchanges, a majority of miners, majority of nodes, some very influential developers, a large amount of users is one corner of the ecosystem and a hostile attack on Bitcoin. Yeah, right.
A hostile attack on Bitcoin is forcing people to pay $10, $20, $30, even $40 fees to push a transaction through at peak times, I don't care the reason.
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:01:36
This is exactly how it works, sadly. Lightning network _is_ lame
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:27:03
What is up with so many Blockstream departures recently? Right when Lightning Network gets released too... anyone?
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:56:46
Hahahaha a change.org petition. You’re really changing the world dude, congrats
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:35:17
If you aren’t blindly for the party line, you get hate. Simple as that 
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:51:13
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:39:12
Yeah, it seems like it might be really hard to get liquidity (for multiple/many hop routing) without some hubs. Hopefully some larger players in the BTC network will start to create some larger nodes &amp; more liquid nodes so everything gets a little smoother!
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:23:44
Segwit2x was LITERALLY "Implement Segwit now, increase the block size to 2 MB in December" if you look past all the politics and BS around it. I'll spell it out for you so you remember next time... It's right in the name -- Segwit (for segregated witness) 2X (for double the block size, 1MB x 2 = 2MB).
So everything is a hostile takeover that you disagree with? Got it.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:58:55
Dude you wrote all of that and didn’t answer my question in the slightest. 
Is the money you have in BTC right now for *storing value*?
No, it’s not. A store of value is *stable* almost by definition. How can you call something a store of value that swings by +/- 10% every single month? 
Bitcoin is a speculative investment at the moment. Some other groups are trying to use it as digital cash, and it must fulfill that criteria before becoming some type of long term hedge like gold. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:34:18
Look up LIFO and FIFO rules. If you spend and replace (where you replace slightly before you spend) you shouldn’t have to pay taxes. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:55:56
No it won’t. And no, they won’t. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:17:10
So not many people have adopted/invested in BTC, but you're arguing for a store of value. When again, 99.999% of people (according to you) have not adopted in, or frankly, care about BTC.
You are really *speculating* on BTC becoming a store of value, and being adopted by &gt;0.001% of people. While I am speculating on Bitcoin becoming digital cash.
That's like me saying Bitcoin IS digital cash. No, that's just incorrect. Yes, I've used Bitcoin to buy things, but it is only accepted at 0.001% of retailers.
If Bitcoin WAS digital cash, it would be accepted everywhere. If Bitcoin WAS a store of value, it would have a stable value, and be accepted/invested in/used by &gt;0.001% of people.
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:36:28
Yeah a lot of people stopped using BTC from a month or two ago. Should be pretty cheap!
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:24:22
Ah, got it. It's probably because the channel is pushed away from you, so you can't send, only receive. Even though you got 100 sats, you still needed to pay the fee for the send...
Hopefully they can get some of these kinks worked out, but seems like this is just how LN is going to work, in a way...? It will definitely help to be connected to some big hubs so that others are only 1 hop away. I wonder how much you need to be a big central hub? I just wouldn't feel comfortable leaving that much in a hot, always online wallet, but I'm sure some people will!
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:39:35
Exactly correct. Say you started the channel with 1000 sats, it will look like this:
(Bitrefill) 0 &lt;----&gt; 1000 sats (YOU)
After you paid the other dude:
(Bitrefill) 100 - 2 sat fee = 98 sats &lt;-----&gt; 900 sats (YOU)
When you are trying to receive:
(Bitrefill) 98 - 100 (wanting to be sent) = -2 sats (invalid) &lt;----&gt; 900 sats (YOU)
Sadly, this is how the LN is going to work. It will be difficult to receive more than you have sent, because others will not route through your node when you don't have much liquidity, they will take the path of least resistance through a large hub. Therefore, funds will only get pushed to Bitrefills side when you are sending funds (other option is that someone sends through you, but that doesn't seem likely because of the above)
EDIT: Saw your edit, I guess the channel is funded. Not sure what is going on then, LN is very very complicated
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:03:58
This is 100% possible and a basic accounting technique. It exists solely on paper, you don't need to take the "newest" UTXO and use that.
You don't pay tax, because there was zero capital gain. Understand? Your brand new bitcoin hasn't appreciated, so there is not tax on and appreciation.
Instead of SPEND then REPLACE, it should be REPLACE then SPEND (newest coin)
Again, you don't need to actually USE the newest coin, nor keep track of your coin-age. Just use LIFO (last in first out) accounting technique.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:34:44
Seems like BCH fees are always lower.
BitPay accepts BCH
Purse.io accepts BCH
But LN will definitely save the day in "18 months"... too bad every merchant will have moved over by then LOL. It's "coming soon" though don't worry about your bag!
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:50:59
Right. And it's how investing works too. It's all probabilistic, so don't act like you know shit
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:57:58
All I see is that BCH fees are consistently lower. What’s the problem again monkey boy?
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:00:48


So don't use Coinbase because they signaled for a 2 MB block size instead of a 1 MB block size. Don't use any pool that signaled for a 2 MB block size, instead of a 1 MB block size. I think it's fairly clear, he's saying we should reject any company/service with a different idea of the protocol than he has.
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:58:24
Bitcoin Cash - transactions are low but steadily increasing
BCore - transactions at all time low of 2 years, steadily decreasing
It’s called being a bag holder buddy, sorry that you bought at the ATH 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:02:55
True! I bet it could work down the road. But how long is that going to take? The internet surely wasn’t built in 6 months, and was pretty non-functional for a decade almost? 
Meanwhile BTC’s competitors are picking up steam using the same tech that has been proven to work since 2009. Tech that intrinsically has less hiccups than LN. 
Whose going to win that race? Time will tell
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:52:22
Yeah, Segwit has been decent, blocks are hovering around 1.1 MB instead of 1 MB pre-segwit. Not sure how much space batching reduces, but those are only exchange tx's, not actual people using BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:25:11
So boycott everyone that has a slightly different direction that they wish the BTC protocol should take? Voicing a differing opinion is forbidden, especially in a decentralized system? Lol
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:56:20
These are pretty impressive damn
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:49:40
To be honest man, LN is looking like a disaster, and is really crippling BTC. It’s already complicated enough, unless LN network is perfectly implemented, it’s never gonna get use by the average person, and BTC is going to remain what the average Joe buys when he wants to fund his sports betting account on Bovada or whatever. Definitely not going to become digital cash, nor a new means of payment. 
You know there is an alternative right?
