Just all too much hassle and risk if your house burns down. I bet your password system if far less user friendly than running lastpass seamlessly across devices.
Lastpass isn't perfect, but it  certainly isn't "the worst". No passwords were lost in this attack as everything is encrypted.

I get you, it would be a very interesting experiment. That's why I like bitcoin as an experiment into how truly free markets work... At the moment it's a mixture of working well and being a cluster fuck (mt gox for example) ... Very entertaining though.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:22:18
No chance, Bitcoin is at present incapable of enough transactions per minute, far too volatile, still open to a 51% attack, in need of a hard fork and the infrastructure isn't there yet.

I cant see why its anything like that. Even if the dealer was caught and surrendered his Bitcoin wallet (Which the police would arguably not even think of looking for). They would then have to have the time, resources and motivation to obtain (probably federal or even international) warrants to find the names and addresses of those who sent the dealer money.
Even then that's not enough proof that you bought drugs.

I don't see Bitcoin as being used for day to day 'off line'  commerce... I don't see your customers using it any more than a single time novelty. 
I think Bitcoin could however explode in online use scenarios... if say Twitch or YouTube or even Reddit integrated a small cents donation if you click the like or upvote which pays the content creator I think thats game changing. To me Micro payments is where its at. 
In 3 years I think the blockchain could start to be used by some big organisations. 
If Bitcoin gains a higher value and more stability I think you could see money flying in from countries who are having trouble with their own currencies. 
Charity, Gift cards, asset records... things like these are what Bitcoin is good at. Not buying a sandwitch in the local shop.

@_date: 2015-06-12 05:58:20
Yes the majority of those 300 million function just fine in a fairly free market. Quite a few million do not and either need locking up or support... That's what a central organisation can do. I would say the US locks too many people up and supports too many people... I didn't say your system is working perfectly! 
As for the moon example... Say we decide to go to Mars and its going to cost $300,000 million (1000) per us citizen. Most wouldn't want to contribute. Forced taxes enable such an endeavour. I'm not American, but to me the moon landing is probably mankind's greatest feat.

@_date: 2015-06-20 06:43:58
Bitcoin is not a serious way to hedge that risk. It's too volatile, can't handle enough transactions and if all the Greeks piled in we'd have a bubble which would burst as traders take all the Greeks money. In 5 years bitcoin may be an option for counties in this state... But not today.

Why would people withdrawing their Bitcoin cause the exchange to close? These are Bitcoin exchanges not banks who use fractional lending. It means no less profitability for an exchange, unless people decide to stop buying and selling there.

Yes you have an annoying tone...also you are alienating and trolling to a group who may very well be silver investors too you idiot. It's not either / or...we just see value in a digital currency as we live in a digital age. It's no more of a ponzi scheme than silver...i bet you want silver to grow in value don't you? 
You think we may regress back to an old form of money. What's wrong with hedging your bets with both. You just come across as a silver pumper. The Bitcoin price is still far above when you started your anti Bitcoin rants...I used to actually follow you on YouTube before you went down that road as you had some interesting points...but you have now turned into some sort of troll. If the dollar collapses it will probably be replaced by a digital currency...I'm not saying it will be Bitcoin, but it's unlikely we'll return to silver.

Ha ha, I hope it doesn't It's still bit of fun. I'm not going to waste any money or Bitcoin on something with no hard limit though.

In 3 years can you envisage serious merchants accepting doge for goods instead of a better more secure virtual currency? 
The world of commerce is a serious business. 
Doge may move in line with Bitcoin for a while same as the many other joke currencies...but one day Bitcoin will explode upward again and leave the jokes in its dust.

Interesting points...though if I had just been burned for a few hundred coins I think I would call it a day on Bitcoin. Saying that, they shouldn't have had that many on an exchange either. I think a dip like after the silk road bust then some stagnation...a few more big companies like neo popping up then we're off for a big bubble around April again! The press will have written us off, and hopefully forgotten about us...But then be forced to post about our resurrection! I'm pretty sure Bitcoin is resilient enough to weather this and will be stronger for it.
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:45:14

Wow, great memory there! Ha, I was so pissed off with everything when it popped in April I just sold the lot and took the money. Seemed a lot at the time, but man do I wish I had not done that!

I wouldn't dump them, the exchanges would know who you are. I would slowly sell them on multiple exchanges, buy gold and other items and sell as many as possible on localbitcoins.  I'd also save a load as you could one day be one of the richest people on the planet. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:01:44
That's an interesting point, Zerocoin does have less potential than Bitcoin. I think however it could still be very successful for the more nefarious uses which Bitcoin currently facilitates. Of course projects such as dark wallet can mimic complete anonymity...So zerocoin might need to bring something else to the table.
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:45:57
I hold Bitcoin as essentially it could become massive around the entire globe in the coming years. I would love to travel abroad and not have to worry about foreign exchange. I don't use it a huge amount now as it's still early days...everything should get more user friendly though. If I waited to get in I would have paid a lot more for my coins.
I guess another reason I like Bitcoin is that I own a financial asset which has no counter party risk. Cash money is just a promise from the bank/government. I own my Bitcoin and nobody knows how much / where etc. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:37:33

People sell low as they think we are going lower...and it's possible, what if the devs can't fix the issue? What if gox is insolvent? What if 44000 Bitcoins from the SR are dumped? I'm not saying any of this was going to happen...but noobs might have thought it was. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:18:25

@_date: 2014-01-01 01:41:39
I sold a few hundred in April thinking I was cool taking a profit. I lost faith in Bitcoin. I've had to buy back in at greater cost. I've only ever lost money when trying to time the market. Now I'm just buy and hold, I genuinely think Bitcoin has a big future, so I'm not going to sell anymore. Only buy more and spend Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:11:09
I guess my view on this is: fiat is probably better as a currency than Bitcoin or Gold. You cant have any meaningful monetary policy with the Gold standard or Bitcoin, and both encourage hoarding. The problem is with a mismanaged fiat system (as we have), where it loses too much of its value and is inflated to oblivion. 
Bitcoin and Gold may not be perfect money, but the argument here is that it will be useful if the dollar collapses / takes a dive as it will preserve your wealth. 
It could just be a stepping stone before a new currency system is created. 
And you are correct, all currency systems collapse, unless you count Gold as a currency... I certainly would take gold for payment still. 
I think the dollar will lose a significant amount of value when it loses reserve status... which is pretty much a foregone conclusion, unless the US have created the first immortal reserve currency. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:45:31
Thanks, I'm slowly getting it all! I did know that banks actually create money out of thin air which blew my mind. I'm starting to see how QE might not actually lead to hyperinflation, if they can undo it when needed. I'm still not a big fan of inflation though as it seems like a stealth tax and the gov slowly reducing their debts...I'm guessing inflation is good too though? This topic is more complex than it seems on the surface! Pretty sure Bitcoin would be bad as a national currency, I still think it has a place though.

They regret not 'getting in early' and are too risk averse to buy any now or simply don't understand what Bitcoin is. Some people think 'we're up to something' because of the psuedo anonymous nature of Bitcoin. Also, I think because it doesn't fit with their neat view of the finance world they want it to go away. Perhaps also, they are fed up of hearing about it

It's fairly rude to ask about someone wealth. But I have enough. Although i made a nice profit, I regrettably sold about 400 in march 2013. Although less trollish than yourself my opinion on Bitcoin at the time was similar to yours now. During the time since I have used bitcoin and learnt a lot more about what Bitcoin actually is and it's potential... Which is why I don't want to sell any now and why I'm not affected by your comments. Check out the charts, there have been hundreds of drops like today's... Each time, like clockwork your ’type' come out to play. It's boring, pointless and quite sad really. Bitcoin is only about 3% of my portfolio so if it did go to zero... I really wouldn't care. It's been a very rewarding experience, actually the things I have learnt outweigh the profit I made in 2013. How many do you have? If you have some I find your conduct even more bemusing!

It's usually correlated to news rather than inversely with sentiment. The recent downturn was due to the potential possibility of liquidating 200k gox coins and actual stoppage of Chinese banks, both occurred after the little pump earlier. Eden the sentiment was positive through November the price kept going up which negates your theory.

You contradict yourself there, how can you think it's both too expensive yet it will skyrocket...implying it's cheap right now? There really is no perfect time to buy Bitcoin...some news could come tomorrow which pushes it to an all time high...you will either be chasing it on the way up or missing the rally and thinking 'it's too expensive again'. If you can't afford to lose it, don't spend it.

Its not beyond the realms of possibility that it could be widely used in some shit hole country who have a crap native currency. 
I will admit my speculations are incorrect if the price hits single digits within the decade. I think the trajectory over the last 12 months would indicate we are well on target to make a splash on the world stage...despite a few hiccups and setbacks. They only make Bitcoin stronger in my opinion.

Bitcoin can and is being gamed. It's an unregulated market...there is nothing to stop insider trading at exchanges. Every day you see whales manipulating the price. Shorting bitcoin, buying puts etc all help to reduce volatility so people shouldn't "ignore this shit". A lot of Bitcoin holders are trying to make $'s not btc . Nobody knows where btc is heading so you can't guarantee anything. I bet some traders made a fortune shorting the recent crash.

As you can't get cash out, it's irrelevant if people buy coins or not. The net amount of cash owed by gox remains the same. The only variable is the amount of fees they are making. If they don't have enough coins (if they were robbed) they would need to buy off other exchanges.

Why would the barriers to entry be extreme? You don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin. Also, if it can't clean it's act up...the markets for money laundering, drug dealing and offshore banking are plenty large enough. Bitcoin doesn't necessarily need bitter 'tech /sci' guys who feel they missed the boat to become massive. Early adopters deserve to be rewarded as they took the most risk...and years of being told they were idiots.

Everyone's criticisms of Bitcoin are so short sighted.
Bitcoin is still a baby, it will be made very easy to buy and use in time. In a few years when people realize they can travel anywhere in the world and spend Bitcoin without bothering with exchanging currencies it will take off.

Then you guys call us mean spirited and you have a conflict on your hands.

dogecoin is a joke, but its also a way of teasing pocket money and more Bitcoins out of youngsters who dont know what they are doing.

No problem at all if I'm honest. You could boot up a live USB of some different distros and see which one you feel comfortable with. As for security... haven't needed to do anything. As long as you download your software from reputable places you're pretty much safe. If you need to do anything important on Ubuntu you need to enter your admin password. 
Its not as vulnerable as Windows so I don't even need to bother with 3rd party firewalls and anti-viirus's weighing my OS down. 
Pretty sure there are far less viruses around which target windows. 
Still new to this all though, I understand some distros exist which are even tighter on security than Ubuntu.

Nahh, a low value wouldn'd decrease volatility and I don't see how it benefits rich guys. Could it be manipulated? Sure! Bitcoin is unregulated and manipulated to fuck! The china news could be fake, wall street dudes could be trying to cause panic so they can slowly buy in cheap off all the panic sheep. Who knows!

@_date: 2014-03-06 07:06:51
You need to state which ones to have any credibility. Doge? A load of kids tipping cents does not count. Also, once money is involved in anything it gets noticed... Bitcoin either stays under the radar and costs a couple of dollars our it gets hyped and is worth hundreds or thousands. I prefer the latter. If you don't like it being worth more, wait until something like zerocoin comes out...it's less transparent than Bitcoin and will be less well known.
Bitcoin is a money spinner now, no going back.

Its the market price...its what the consensus says the price is, there is nothing artificial about it. YOU are trying to make people act in the way YOU see it with your personal belief that the price is artificial.

You have to elaborate as to why you think it's impractical. If I wasn't financially involved in Bitcoin I would probably hope it fails...as it's success would be hard to watch.

'trivial'...they would need to manufacture a ton of ASICs. Or control a few hundred of the best supercomputers in the world. Just make Bitcoin illegal like they did with gold a while back would be easier. A load of kissass countries would follow them.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:27:31
And 'stolen' would fit both scenarios... he hasn't detailed how and over how long of a period. Pretty simple to do, yet he evaded that.
We are just supposed to accept 'stolen' and shut the fuck up are we?
It makes a great deal of difference to me as to when they were stolen... if over years thats good as it means they have probably been resold. This also means mark has been operating fraudulently over the years. 
If they were stolen in one go that means someone has the ability to destroy Bitcoin. I just want to know some more detail, he is not giving it so there must be pressure on him. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:42:26

You think those venture capitalists throwing millions into Bitcoin are gullible? How about the governments taking it seriously? You're clueless and probably too poor to afford any yourself so you attack those who can have a punt on a new speculative asset class. Bitcoin is the best trade I've ever done yet I'm a retard?

The country that the private keys are kept at? Who knows, just one of the lovely implications the Governments of the world are going to have to figure out.
If I die my Bitcoins will be going to my family without paying any inheritance tax... as I believe it is a bullshit tax. It is tax on income that has already fucking been taxed!
And hear lies one of the many reasons Governments hate Bitcoin. It gives power to the little guy. 
If my father transferred all his wealth to Bitcoin on his deathbed... how the hell do the Government get their hands on any. It would be hard (or impossible)  to prove that I had control of those coins! What could they do?

I didn't weather the storm in April... I was so frustrated with Gox and all the hacking and the bubble popping I sold hundreds! (nice profit), but I would have been rich now! Lesson learned.

OK, and you sound like someone who takes the statement of one man as fact. 
I'll agree that I have seen no confirmed facts either way though. Might be just the case that there is no market for a Bitcoin bank or regulatory issues made business impossible for them.

@_date: 2014-02-09 12:47:08
Yes it's a shit sub, made even worse by sad cunts trying to mock people. The voting system here also means negative views get downvoted on Bitcoinmarkets too. All Bitcoin sources are full of pumpers, you just have to try and filter that noise out. 
And again you generalize that everyone here are 'poor souls'...whilst many are just like you. Just enjoy the ride regardless of where you think Bitcoin is headed, if Bitcoin shot to 2000 tomorrow if Google announced it would accept it I doubt you world get anyone coming to Bitcoinmarkets and laughing at those who got caught from shorting heavily. Some you win, some you lose...who gives a shit in the big picture?
Bitcoin has problems and competitors will come along and I'm ready to jump ship as soon as that happens...so I absorb as much info as possible. Good luck to you...out of interest, what price are you calling for a week today? (Name your exchange...bitfinex probably?)

I think the similarities would be the out of control speculation. Most people who buy Bitcoin hoard it. There is next to nothing for me to spend mine on either (and I live in the UK). If this improves, Bitcoin has a big future. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 07:14:35
How about reading some books to get educated on these matters first?, you won't need to take random peoples views from the internet then. Implying that Bitcoin would be a superior basis for an economy is ridiculous. I love Bitcoin, but as a general currency it would however be bad for an economy. The default position of Bitcoin holders is to hodl, this would be bad for any economy especially one trying to dig itself out of a recession. If your rebuttal is 'I spend my Bitcoin'... good for you! I and many others do not. 
Monetary policy such as expanding the money supply and changing interest rates is useful to direct an economy.

@_date: 2014-03-27 13:44:21
Luckily i'm not in the US... but I'm pretty sure there is no 'unless'. Tax on that profit would be due regardless of if I put it back in to Bitcoin or spent it. The ruling is also retrospective... so there would be many people who now owe tax. Not me though... I dont own any Bitcoin and have never sold any for profit ;) 
@_date: 2014-01-26 08:34:46
That's a load of shit, if someone tried to buy all the coins the price would be astronomical...even if they did it slowly. I get the feeling you sold so the irony with your post is that you too are now biased. You are trying to validate your decision. I'm not selling, there is a chance this technology could be revolutionary. Of course most of us are hoarding, if it were easier to buy and spend Bitcoin this issue would be reduced. These things are happening and I believe Bitcoin is only just getting warmed up.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:38:50
I couldn't care less about the price today, this is a long term thing. But cool, if you get your kicks off those who are feeling panicked and sad right now, lap it up. You're a disgusting and very sad human being. Just out of curiosity, and putting Bitcoin aside here...do you troll any other subreddits? I'm genuinely interested in how you guys tick.

The press always reference the price, if we had a standardized index...They wouldn't pick the lowest price or highest price of the exchanges which fit with the tone of their article. How much is Bitcoin today? 200 or 600? If you use an index price it reduces confusion.

@_date: 2014-02-07 18:47:31
Like torrents they realize they cant kill a decentralized system.
Bitcoin could bring innovation and competitive advantage by minimizing the costs of transferring value. 
Blockchain technology could potentially offer many innovations... a global asset register which cannot be changed could revolutionize many fields.
Better the devil you know... if they dont allow Bitcoin, it will be replaced by something even harder to track. A purely anonymous currency (such as zerocoin) would be even more terrifying.

I think you're wondering what happens if the dollar collapses, not necessarily the stock market. I think people would jump on  Bitcoin, silver and gold.

Bitcoin or a successor could be of some use for sure.

There's no reason for them to close gox...They are still making profit, and possibly selling coins on other exchanges. They could drag Bitcoin down for weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:01:18
Pretty much yep. If you have been in Bitcoin for any length of time you realize that's the best solution. Don't stress and chill out... just remember how far it has come in the last few months alone.
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:49:16
I don't think we should censor anyone, there are also plenty of folk who will downvote that. I think its risky for them as if Bitcoin fails their ideals will be presumed to have failed, so they should perhaps be careful. I'm still not convinced that completely unregulated systems work well (especially with finance).
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:21:14
Absolutely, trying to cause a bank run with zero evidence they are in trouble is stupid. To see what happens after bank runs watch documentaries on the great depression...not fun times. 
Also, I like gold and silver...but seriously I don't get why people think the price is being manipulated down. Zoom out on the graphs and you will see their price was a bubble that began around 2008. It's just correcting to those levels.
If the economy is in trouble this might be some good advice...but it appears to be growing fairly well on recent data.
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:46:30
This is my take on this too...the feds or someone seized the coins and have him under a gag order. He's playing ball hence the 'Bitcoin can be used for illegal activities' thing. They can't give the coins back or let people find out they seized them as people have committed suicide over gox.

Some may have that motive, for others it's just a hedge against inflation or a weakening of the dollar...say if it lost reserve status. I can't see a time when we are bartering using precious metals again. If the dollar collapsed I think people would jump to other currencies or a new world one would be created.

There is no way in hell the US Government would allow private money to overtake the dollar... they would outright ban it first (they banned Gold once!). 
No shops would be allowed to accept it, and users would get in trouble. Bitcoin would still have value however. 
Far more likely a crypto-dollar would be issued which can be controlled and taxed.

Then they regulate the exchanges and any merchants who wish to accept it as payment. They are most likely going to issue Bit-licences for merchants who will probably be only allowed to accept Bitcoin if they "know the customer".

How? I have literally seen the same graph about 20 times and it has never resulted in a compete collapse as that graph indicates. Sure we could go a bit lower until the shit show at gox is sorted but we'll be back setting ATHs in the coming months. 
A serious question...what do you get out of posting that anyway? Have you sold so are now hoping Bitcoin dies to justify your decision? Or do you get pleasure from reposting something we've seen many times hoping to annoy some people? Think about it dude...that's pretty pathetic isn't it?

If gox comes out with a positive statement on Monday you might never see it that low again. If gox are fooked it could go to 500...and we have no real reason think they are, only rumors from people probably wanting cheap coins. Tough call! Personally I would buy now though.

You mean Auroracoin which recently forked? To mean a few setbacks for Bitcoin are expected and needed. From them we learn, move on and get stronger. It was single digits only 14 months ago...It's been amazingly resilient considering what it's been through. None of the alts show any sort of competition and all owe their existence to Bitcoin paving the way. Safer exchanges are coming online and things are moving at abb exceptional pace. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:27:33
Well for those that want anonymity they can use the soon to be released Dark Wallet. As for fees, I thought the default was just reduced drastically?, and as for regulation...I'm amazed it's so light even in the US. A year ago I could have sworn they would ban it. It's pretty unregulated in the UK and the majority of the world. Gox and neo are just an early market shaking out bad players. Rest assured millions are being invested in new services by venture capitalists (buttercoin and other exchanges regulated in the us).
Personally I don't think we have saturated demand by a long way. Can you name a quicker and cheaper method for me to send funds to someone across the globe? You won't like it but there is still a massive untapped underground market too...Bitcoin is like a digitized offshore bank. That market alone is huge. Within a year when the new exchanges are perceived as safe you will see wall street pumping millions in. And I will continue to hold...that's not a bad thing you know. I also hold my native currency.

To answer your question, I'm not selling no. I've seen a few crashes before and it's nothing, not even worried. What is it about you guys that you come out of the woodwork when the price is going down? You get excited that you think people are losing money?...man that's sad. I think all the venture capital and infrastructure that's come in to Bitcoin over the last six months it's setting it's up to beat the all time high later this year. The current price is irrelevant...I hope China hurries up and leaves.

How can you possibly know it will be cheaper tomorrow. I for one hope it will be as buying when everyone else is shitting themselves is a good strategy... but my funds haven't got to bitstamp yet. I don't feel as though I have lost anything, I still have the same number of coins as I had yesterday. The price in the short term doesn't matter to me. Bitcoins value can increase rapidly after you sell anticipating a further fall...I have learnt that the hard way during the April crash, the fork and one other time (I can't remember what crisis that was). I actually hold less Bitcoin from trying to guess if the market is going down further.

Whether it works or not is yet to be seen... I will only consider the project a success if it reaches wide adoption and maintains a stable price! ... if not it would just be an example of how an unregulated system does not function particularly well. 
You are an anarcho capitalist then? 
They shouldn't have to leave... only the ones who want to! I just think it would be great for their cause. If it worked I would want to live there too. 
It seems what you suggest is that everything is either run for non-profit or run on a business model where only the best survive?

People are selling blatantly because of China news. People buy and sell in relation to news in all markets otherwise there would be no point in buying stocks. If a company released bad sales figures your opinion that the price the stock is unrelated to that news...it is, directly. The down votes and the pure number of China posts should be a give away for your if you think this is just my belief. You need to learn how markets function before you talk about a function.

Sorry to hear that, although you should learn more about Bitcoin before writing it off as a scam. Sure the 'to the moon guys' are annoying, but it's a useful technology.

Bitcoin is more prone to boom and bust and there is an extreme concentration of wealth at the top. I never said the policies were amazing, only necessary and they haven't always been used correctly and give scope for abuse to enable the Government to inflate its way out of debts. We haven't got anything better yet... Bitcoin would be no better. At best Bitcoin would be as good as the Gold standard which was scrapped for a number of very valid reasons.

Yes, just as the Gold standard was a poor basis for an economy so would bitcoin. 
I concede that monetary policy hasn't always been managed correctly, but it is useful to speed up or slow down an economy. If you think Bitcoin would just lead to a smooth  economy with no boom and busts I think you are mistaken. Especially considering the evidence of its short life... people hoard and speculate causing large boom and busts. It would be a crap basis for an economy to run on... far too deflationary. You need a spot of inflation to 'grease the wheels' so to speak.

No banning the exchanges from selling you Bitcoin, banning merchants from accepting it or even outright banning does not make it useless. 
It will however reduce its potential by a significant margin. If all you can spend it on is black market tor stuff... the price will be back to the double digits soon enough.
The majority of Bitcoin holders are not libertarian, free market supporting ideologists ... they are speculators hoarding a new technology in the hope that it goes mainstream and makes them a lot of money. To do that it needs to get a pass from the Governments of the world. 
Thats why you see the Winklevosses et al bending over and kissing ass right now... there is a ton of money (value) to be created with Bitcoin. 
So yes, I measure Bitcoins success in its value. if you measure it differently, thats cool. I have very little use for Bitcoin if I have nothing to spend it on... thats not success. Its also a crap store of value as its so volatile... it will be successful when its price is stable, for that you need a large economy of vendors accepting it. Without regulatory clarification you will not see enough investment in businesses as it will be too risky.

If you can't see why banks would hate Bitcoin, you are naive. And world governments clearly hate Bitcoin...see China, Russia. Perhaps the US government haven't banned it yet to let the little people feel free. Secretly they certainly could be trying to destroy it. Just read some of the Snowden leaks to find out the things they get up to. Gchq ddos irc channels which is illegal.

Be careful though...I paid for my vpn with bitcoin and a burner email address. My account stopped working a few months later and I had no way of proving it was mine.

It's never going 'mainstream' anyway, the tax responsibility in the US has probably guaranteed that. Sure Bitcoin is complicated, I was confused at the start, now it's easy. There are enough geeks willing to learn how to use it and enough demand for a commodity which can be used for money laundering, tax evasion, illicit payments, capital flight or just good old fashioned speculation to ensure Bitcoin is here for a while. I've recently got into the stock market, that took me a good six months of study. If you think Bitcoin is complex try the world of derivatives, swaps, options, futures etc etc... a ridiculously complex world and yet a very popular one which does not seem to have a problem attracting money. 
There's an equal amount of effort trying to keep people away from Bitcoin so don't worry.

Ha, yea it's easy to accept the mantra that Bitcoin is perfect and fiat is crap...But Bitcoin has ignited a curiosity in me and I've read some books which show it's not that clear cut! I know Bitcoin would be a bad general currency as I don't want to spend it (could be worth more tomorrow!). It does have some cool uses though...taking millions across boarders in your head for example.  Our money system isn't perfect, but our quality of life is pretty good compared to many!  Still think the national debt is getting a bit stupid though.

Taking advantage of the knowledge of not having enough Bitcoin! Nobody else knew that, and nobody else could withdraw the cheap coins from gox and sell them on stamp for twice the price. Only mark! This would reduce the price on other exchanges, whilst simultaneously reducing his btc liability and increasing his fiat reserves at OUR expense. It's possibly fraud, depends if he engineered the cheap price on gox.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:53:56
We're not luring in anyone. If they buy something they don't understand then they are idiots. I don't think the future of Bitcoin is to remove banks and governments...it's just cash for the internet age. If you don't get it, that's cool. 
I have mixed feelings on your tax issue too. I don't mind paying tax for roads, schools etc...but they keep spending it on wars and spying on us. So they can fuck themselves.
And really, we've seen you trolls warning everyone off for a long time, since Bitcoin was single digits...yet here we are. You short sighted luddites will be saying the same as we climb higher.

I don't see it affecting the vast majority of accountants. The majority of businesses will probably not be accepting Bitcoin in the next few years (if ever) as it will probably remain fairly niche. I'm a number cruncher too, if my company ever did accept btc I think you would just need a couple of new skills...translating the exchange rate of Bitcoin in to the reporting currency. And working out the tax due. In short, not a great deal different and most of it would probably be automated.

Well I wouldn't be surprised if it touches 300... So perhaps you'll get back in. To be fair the price you buy at is actually irrelevant... Bitcoin is a binary bet. It's either going to zero or 10s of thousands. When I sold most of mine I ranted in here how it will never be legal and how it's doomed to fail. The joke was on me.

It would make Bitcoin look like a complete joke if this happened. People would lose faith in it. I feel sorry for those on Gox who lost a lot... but at the end of the day they shouldn't have been keeping considerable wealth on a Japanese exchange which has failed before. 
I doubt Mark has lost any private keys, and he is a moron if he kept them all in a single cold wallet. More than likely they were stolen a couple of years ago and he has been operating a fractional reserve exchange... hoping to make enough in fees to cover it.
Or his wallet implementation was so shit they lost the lot.
Or most likely the US gov have frozen the wallets as part of an investigation in to the Silk Road. Or a blatant attempt to kill Bitcoin. 
Its tough, but many would not want to see the protocol bastardized to give these people their coins back. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 07:16:23

Wow, you dig back in time to troll? That's some sad dedication there pal. As I said in the above... if they fail I lose some btc, so what. I knew it was risky, and like a vast number of startups it failed. I don't regret it, you need to take some risks in life...some you win, some you lose. Glad I took a risk on Bitcoin 18 months ago so I can have a gamble on the odd thing. I've been put off investing in other Bitcoin startups which is the biggest shame though. I'll just buy more Bitcoin from now on.
@_date: 2014-01-08 10:32:19
You can't possibly know, confirmation of Netflix accepting or Europe banning could come on any day. On the brief history of Bitcoin if you are going to buy, now would be as good a time as ever after a slight correction. If you are holding out until the end of the month to see if the Chinese deadline has been priced in or not, be aware that many others are doing the same. If there is hardly any down trend at the end of the month the price could rocket and you will have to pay even more than today.

Used for centuries as money, it's physical so harder to lose than Bitcoin and harder to be confiscated or devalued by inflation.

Whilst those fuck ups have happened, they certainly are not the reason for the price being so high. It's also pretty irrelevant even if Bitcoin is lost, deleted etc as they are divisible by 8 decimal places or more. So plenty to go around. 
Gold whilst divisible would get pretty unusable if it became dust. The value of gold like Bitcoin is completely arbitrary. It is a metal found in the ground. It is valuable because we have found less of it than other metals on our planet. 
Bitcoin is not acting as a currency yet...but it has more chance of being a future currency than gold. This is the 21st, century the world has gone digital...that's why you are debating here rather than in person or writing your opinion on paper.
If you are unable to look after your Bitcoin or you spend them unwisely or you can't take some price volatility...you shouldn't buy any.
Wait until innovation catches up...just as early gold finders probably had to wait for gold vaults to be invented and wait until the price stabilizes.
Although golds price has yet to stabilize...could go down more this year?!

@_date: 2014-02-11 14:35:02
It's more complicated than that, for each big retailer who accepts Bitcoin the vision of Bitcoins future looks brighter...so the price goes up. If the retailers sell immediately this could push the price down, but the person who spends the Bitcoin might buy more. Overall the more business who accept, the higher the price goes though.

Things can be built on top of the blockchain...trusted addresses for example so the vendor knows you're good for the funds or a third party which guarantees you Will pay despite one confirmation. It's but technically possible to have instant confirms, but I believe solutions will be developed in the future.  The blockchain is just the backbone.

I can afford to lose everything I have in Bitcoin so I won't be needing your tax thanks. I don't need your advice either...as you don't know what you are talking about. Bitcoin is not a get rich scheme...It's a very risky new asset class. If you don't like risk, and don't get what it's all about, you should just stay the fuck in r/investing and talk about bond yields. We don't need your advice...as you have none.

Don't underestimate them, if you feel you understand Bitcoins implications be assured that they do. 
Also do not overestimate Bitcoins ability to replace fiat any time soon. Sure one day currencies will be purely digital... but I honestly think Bitcoin would be a crap replacement for an entire country to run on. You cant use monetary policy to steer the economy and slow it down / get yourself out of recession. 
Also its too deflationary! I hate spending Bitcoin!! Thats why mild inflation is good... its an incentive to spend and keep the economy moving. 
I love Bitcoin and it has its place in the world however... I feel they have figured along the same lines as me though. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:59:00
Stop being so narrow minded... the protocol can be updated to deal with the volume.
Who said it would have to service the entire worlds financial system? 
Sure the Blockchain will be large, but storage capacity is increasing at a much faster rate that the blockchain could. Individuals wont need to download teh blockchain if it became terrabytes... it would operate similar to how the electrum client does with the blockchain in the cloud. 
I expect multiple hardforks and modifications to the protocol in the coming years. If you cant see that happening, dont buy any Bitcoin.

Pretty sure those tax rules you have there in the US won't be changing. You guys need as much tax revenue as possible to cover your deficit. It will not be going away as it's logical and fair. You wouldn't expect the profits you make on stocks or gold sales to be tax free so why do you expect them to be on Bitcoin, just because it's called a currency (by us)? It is a commodity. Luckily I live in a country which are a bit easier on the tax than the US are though. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:21:50
A high price does add stability as it's too costly to throw Bitcoin around. At the moment a single guy can move the market! The markets are pushing for an all time high so they haven't lost much credibility. If anything the whole financial crisis shows that regulation is needed in financial markets as they don't work very well in a free market. People see Bitcoin as having far less credibility than even banks after the shit they pulled...and like it our not...If big money can be made, they will get involved, and I welcome it.
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:06:22
Yea, just install Armory on the offline computer and run in offline mode. Create a wallet, back it up to a USB or print a paper backup and send your Bitcoins to the receive address it generates without ever touching the net. 
You can install another copy of Armory on your online computer (second ssd) and import a watch only wallet (created by the offline client). 
The online Armory can send Bitcoin ONLY after you create an unsigned transaction and sign it with the offline Armory client. 
I use it this way and it works well. There is a tutorial on Youtube.

I assure you the 'depression' you think we're in would have been much worse had the 'money manipulation' not been an option. Lowering interest rates (causing the high stock market prices) is a time tested response to stimulate an economy. In a Bitcoin world you have no such monetary policy options.

The existing alts are basically pointless clones of Bitcoin, with no merchant acceptance and less security. They dont devalue Bitcoin at all, if anything just the pure number of them adds credibility to Bitcoin as being the 'real deal'.

Sure you will argue its not anonymous... but it can be with technologies such as dark walltet, mixers and zerocoin.

It's pure speculation, but they could have been seized as part of the silk road take down as some judge could have argued basically all the coins had been used to buy drugs at some point. Also an attempt to make people lose confidence in Bitcoin...rest assured many powerful groups want to see Bitcoin fail. Call me paranoid if you will...you would have called me paranoid if I told you the US were spying on everyone 2 years ago too, and yet they are.
This makes far more sense to me than theft or losing that many coins.

@_date: 2014-01-31 06:48:09
Because with Bitcoin you can send money for basically free! How are banks supposed to compete? They have to reduce their margins. Also with Bitcoin you are essentially your own bank...so you need their services less. Without your savings they have less money from you...they invest your savings and make money from you by lending your money to others! 
I guess an analogy you could use would be...how would you feel about a person who offered your employer to do your job for free! How would you react to that? Scared? 
I guess banks don't see how they can make money from Bitcoin...It's terrifying for them. Just look what technology has done to other industries. Amazon is responsible for thousands of bookstore closures, bittorrent, iTunes etc. Its responsible for killing physical music stores...Netflix is killing cable subscriptions. Banks fear the same fate! 
Governments hate it as they have very little control over it. It gives power to the little guy. Nobody likes to lose power.
So basically we have picked a fight with the two most powerful entities on earth, governments and banks :) fun times.

They have said withdrawals wont be live until at least Monday. Deposits are currently halted whilst they do maintenance to install the updates. They have to test it first? You want them to just flick the switch and hope for the best?
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:05:19
Well it depends on your definition of money doesn't it? If Bitcoin is money he was doing no different to banks lending out your money whilst still claiming to have it on deposit for you. 
I'm not excusing it though... and I cant believe all of the coins are gone. Definitely some fraudulent behavior at the least. Or just frozen by an agency and hes under a NDA. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:44:55
No idea mate, I have some regular stock market funds too. No idea what the dividend will be on these...but it's better than just having a Bitcoin doing nothing in a wallet. Sure I guess the share price could go down...but if they are successful and become a European wide bank, the potential is pretty big. If it doesn't work in Cyprus where they hate banks...It probably won't work anywhere. The dividend will totally depend on their profits.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:04:53
This market can be completely irrational, sure Gox news wasn't looking good for a while.. but actually pulling the trigger and selling is very hard. As you have noticed news can push the price either way in an instant. I have been caught out before by selling then the price zoomed up on some random news.
Bitcoins price will continue to be heavily influenced by the news until there is a solid base of merchants accepting Bitcoin. Until then it is a purely speculative investment... its no surprise investors are skittish. 
If yesterday instead of banning Bitcoin apps Apple had broken news that they are developing their own Bitcoin app... the price would have skyrocketed and blindsided all those who sold as Gox is a piece of shit. 
Hindsight is great, but if you weren't banging on the table to tell people to sell last week, you shouldn't be calling them stupid or simplistic now. It is a world wide market full of all sorts of people. 
... and I love it for pure entertainment! Gox is a complete shit show and have crashed the market about 3 times now? (or more).
In 12 months this will not matter.

One exchange is insolvent and not allowing withdrawals of any kind. Please get informed before posting about something.

Ok well Mr trader I believe we'll be 8-900. I expect multiple large retailers to announce acceptance of Bitcoin and some of the projects venture capitalist have been pouring money in should be coming online. This should mitigate any further China action. Let's see what happens.
Pretty sure gox will resume withdrawals within the next week for btc.

I'm not losing money when the value of Bitcoin goes down... I am losing purchasing power. If the dollar gains over the pound... Brits are not losing money.
I am here for a number of reasons. 
* Bitcon is potentially a game changing technology... much like the internet is. To me Bitcoin is the evolution of the web. It is evolving and monetizing itself. 
* I genuinely believe it is a superior method of buying internet goods and services. Vendors can offer goods and services cheaper as they dont have to cover PayPal or VISA charges...passing savings on to me. I pay for my VPN with Bitcoin, its hard to describe to someone how fluid a transaction it is if they have not done so themselves. 
* I like the pseudo-anonymous nature of Bitcoin. I am genuinely enraged by the extent of the spying done on innocent civilians. Bitcoin is a stance against that. 
* Being your own bank with no third party holding some of your wealth is very liberating. It feels great. 
* Yes I hope to "make money" with Bitcoin... as in I hope to see the purchasing power of my Bitcoins rise. They have been doing very well in the 18 months I have been buying Bitcoin... small drops such as seen recently do not bother me. 
If Bitcoin flops to zero, well too bad. The upside potential far outweights the downside risk. 
I see nothing wrong with early adopters making money (bitcoin or fiat) as they took the risk and had to endure countless comments from people who for whatever reason hopes this new innovative technology fails. 
As I said, many thought the internet was bullshit when it arrived. But it changed the World. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:21:06
OK, well to address the initial thread question... you should not panic sell. Act rationally. 
Your other advice is questionable... I thought my stocks were going to dive earlier in the month as I thought a major correction was due. I didn't sell though despite a dip... I don't regret that now.  
I agree your buy in price doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:58:52

Probably it's pseudo-anonymous nature. The same reasons governments are dubious...it makes money laundering easier.

And not everyone is so retarded they think gun ownership is a good idea. Just look at the ridiculous number of school shoot ups that happen in the US. 
Should people be allowed grenades, TNT or nuclear material in their homes too? 
Should people be "allowed" to steal? (Or am I being childish?)
Guns are banned in the UK, and we have very few gun related deaths... I see this as a good thing. 
We have law and order for good reasons, I'm not saying I follow or agree with all those laws...but society needs them to function.

Lol, you're hilarious. I'm not a zealot...I'm not fully convinced Bitcoin is going to make it, otherwise I'd mortgage my house and buy loads more. It's 50/50 would say. I'm not desperately looking for a system to be in...wtf are you taking about? You're desperately looking for something to do with your time...And I'm willing to bet if you could travel back in time you would buy Bitcoin. Actually...if you post your Bitcoin address (or pm me) I'll send you a Bitcoin. I have plenty...see how it feels to own some!

To be fair the powers (banks and government) are not stupid... they know what Bitcoin represents. At least he is being honest. 
They will fight it tooth and nail behind the scene... pretty hard to stop, and they know worse things will come (zerocoin) if they don't let Bitcoin live. At least they can trace the blockchain with bitcoin.

I'm no expert, but the level of encryption is insane. There are more potential Bitcoin addresses than atoms in the universe!
I also love open source software and think that this has been well reviewed. 
I'm less trusting of the exchanges, but it was an interesting journey learning how to protect my Bitcoins via cold storage on a fresh offline linux machine. 


I don't think it has a chance of replacing fiat anymore than PayPal has... its a useful alternate with unique properties.
Saying that I dont see any reason why citizens of a country with a crap hyperinflating currency wouldn't fly to Bitcoin as a safe haven in the future. 
I like Bitcoin (as like gold), it has no counter party risk... I am not dependent on someone else's promise. I actually own my private keys. 
I think some prefer it to fiat as our Givernments are simply printing money to get themselves out of trouble. I like that a 
government doesn't have that power over Bitcoin. 
Ultimately I see Bitcoin as a sort of hedge against future inflation, and I also like that I can cross boarders with a load of wealth in just stuck in a brain-wallet!

I'm not being ignorant, I just fall to understand what you think you're teaching me. If you think it's going down then sell, if you think it's going up then buy /hold? 
My point is even if you are bearish and think it's going to dip a little more, selling and locking in a loss isn't always a good strategy as the price can quickly rebound above your sell point. If you want out...sure sell away.
@_date: 2014-05-24 12:38:52
Very true, its easy to spout the mantras of 'fuck the Government/Banks', but they don't suggest any reasonable alternatives. The Bitcoin price is manipulated to fuck! And absolutely nothing stops the guys at exchanges profiting by playing around either (front running on an incoming big buy for example). 
Governments and their regulations help us all day, for example I can be pretty sure the Big Mac I had earlier wasn't horse meat! 
I dont like all their rules and I think they waste a ton of money, but Governments do help us... I dont think that makes me a slave, I can leave when I wish.

@_date: 2014-03-04 07:27:17
Not sure...why don't you try it? I expect the trading fees are lower on btc e? So people who sell are intending to buy back. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:42:14
But you're just guessing at figures there man! Exiting through.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:52:44
Why wouldn't merchants accept Doge or any of the rapidly growing copy cat coins? Because eventually they would be accepting a thousand coins. Why not just one or two that people have heard of?
Bookmark away pal, I got in to Bitcoin pretty early so I couldn't give a shit. 
I'm sure a funnier meme will come along soon. 
And the fact that joe average can still mine it on gpu kind of proves my earlier point that it is far less secure. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:21:27
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:02:35
Its not necessarily "lock in losses" either though is it... some of us got our coins ages ago. 
I guess the issue I have is that I think anyone who sells Bitcoin is locking in a loss (unless they intend to buy back) as the price is going up in the long term. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:51:10
Cool, stop making up lies though buddy...it's not big and it's not clever!

Not many expected Bitcoin to go from $12 to $1200 in 2013, but it did... and many believe you ain't seen nothing yet pal ;)

Yea, but you can claim all losses too
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:34:06
I've seen it happen a few times. If you wanted a load of coins...would setting up a large limit order be the cheapest way of doing it? This guy has started a little rally so he'll have to buy more expensive coins now if he still wants them. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 11:18:14
Dude, you know fuck all about my mindset or opinion of where I think Bitcoin is heading. You only assume I think its going 'to the moon;' and 'you're a permabull' because I happen to be browsing r/bitcoin. This is a pretty shit community and I get a lot more interesting info from /bitcoinmarkets. 
Not selling is not a terrible strategy, are you suggesting I drop all my stocks as we may be entering a bear market there too?
That's stupid... just understand not everyone wants to trade. I have tried it, made a bit, lost a bit... but overall I didn't enjoy it. Far too stressful in such an unpredictable market. 
Well done if you recently made money. Gloating and mocking others is pretty fucking sad though. 
I am well up over all (more than I could have dreamed), and just as with my shareholdings I have a long term horizon. 
I made a small fortune last April but didn't mock those who lost out. 
You think Warren Buffet fucking sold at every dip then mocked those who didn't? Nope... because he was a successful gent, not a complete tool like you.

I apologize for my overly enthusiastic comments...I'm new to buying shares within the Bitcoin world and realize if I say anything positive about them it looks like I'm pumping. Truth is, I never world of heard of neobee without these sort of posts. I hope they are legit, they seem to have developed some decent products...actually getting people to buy them after seeing gox collapse is another thing.

Really? You don't think the US Government could have seized the wallets as part of the Silk Road investigation and put a gag on him?
Or a gang just said "give us your wallets or we cut your legs off"... I would hand over anything they wanted in that scenareo. 
More likely that stealing that many coins without being noticed. 
Both scenarios explain why he is not disclosing what happened. 
The US have pretty much shown they do what the fuck they want.CHHQ were busted recently for taking photos of 1.8 million innocent yahoo chatters recently... you would have said I was paranoid for expecting that a week ago. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:24:22

It's a ploy to make investors confident there's support for a given price...fearing the price will soon be rising they buy in. The guy then pulls the buy wall and dumps a load of coins for a higher price than otherwise. This of course is a theory...that guy could also seriously just want to buy a lot of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-22 08:31:17
I think even he would have been surprised by how bad gox have handled the situation...As we all are. I didn't panic when he said about the ddos. Again, how was he supposed to have foreseen that? If anything, knowing there are intelligent guys out there who can explain wtf is going on with Bitcoin to us mortals reduces my panic. His communications have been better than the core devs. I if you don't like his opinions...don't follow or listen to him.
@_date: 2014-02-22 08:23:38
No. He said mtgox has incompetent management...It does. As for ethereum he's not so much pumping it as just looking forward to testing it. If he finds it a piece of shit he'd probably say. He's said nothing yet which I think has been unethical or wrong. He's a great spokesperson for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:29:44
Well yea, any of us who have been in Bitcoin for a while spent loads. I sold hundreds when they were single digits...I still have some now. No reason to believe they are poor just because they dress like they do. Some people are not materialistic and don't want people to know about their wealth.

I'm European and never use nano, it doesn't have to be bits bit I think we need a simple sub unit to Bitcoin. After 18 months I still don't know (or really care) what a nano bit is.

I think it's more the online stores that make me excited. For example, if I want to pay for my VPN... Bitcoin is by far the best way to pay for that.
Sure the NSA are going to be all over the blockchain... not a problem. Innovations such as dark wallet and mixers will make their job of tracing us nearly impossible in the not too distant future. 
I use credit cards and PayPal... each tool has its pros and cons. 
I think one of the best features of Bitcoin is the ability to give microtransactions. Like the tipbot on here. 
In the future I will be easily able to tip an artist if I like their music, or tip someone I like on TV if he shows his QR code. 
I'm sure there are cool things I cant even envisage yet that Bitcoin will make possible... and old things like credit cards cannot do.

You can literally find anything on the internet which confirms your own opinion. Those guys who locked in losses on bitstamp at 400 earlier, should have waited. To be honest I don't give a shit anyways, if you believe in Bitcoin you don't think of it as dollar losses anyway...the long term plan is that you won't need to sell out to dollars as Bitcoin is a currency in it's own right. If people are just here to make $s then let them sell, I don't care.
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:03:51
Bad argument, a Bitcoin is infinitely divisible...There's enough to go around. Bitcoin is denominated in many currencies, the USD exchange rate would require many more USD to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:56:48
It's more to do with mind share, the new technology would have to repeat Bitcoins success in the press. Also what would the new currency have to do that can't be built into Bitcoin? Instant transactions? This could be done with a service built on to Bitcoin. Completely anonymous? Again see projects such as dark wallet.
I think Bitcoin is too far ahead to catch now.

Even seasoned pros get stung with Bitcoin, who knows where the fuck the price is going next, up, down, loop the loop. It's a wild ride, if people don't risk what they can't afford to lose then I don't care. Holding is the best strategy going by the short history of Bitcoin

I'm European and find it confusing too despite being proficient in it's use for measurements. I'd prefer bits or even the more cumbersome satoshi's but I know that's not going to happen.

As far as I understand there are no fees. There are arbitrators who referee for free if I understand it correctly. You get your goods, they release your money. 


Theres a huge market for these, well catered for on the Darkweb by a plethora of sites. Maybe they will remain the go to for narcotics, and OB will be mainly used by people who want to trade other goods freely. 


Depends which country you live in. But I wouldn't buy weapons so its of no concern to me. 


Of course some will report the taxes they should pay and send payment off to the Government. There could also be guys who sell (say) home made lemonade and make a fortune... they might not need to declare how much money they make and might decide not to pay any. Its going to be very very difficult for the tax guys to find out how much they think they should have. 
The vast majority selling there wont bother paying taxes. Power sellers may decide to. 
Me too, its an interesting experiment... much like Bitcoin itself. Two years ago when buying Bitcoin I was told repeatedly that it would never work, it was a scam and a pyramid scheme. Last week the Bank Of England wrote a report saying it could be a risk to UK monetary stability. It is now taken very seriously. 
Things change fast. It will be interesting how this plays out.

What would I do if my Government had done the same thing?
I would have decided weeks ago if I wanted to hold Bitcoin or FIAT and left the exchange. You would have to be a moron to wait it out until the end of the month.
 
Just as a fuck you to my Government I would probably keep hold of my Bitcoin, because one country does not dictate the future of Bitcoin.
Many Governments have clarified their stance on Bitcoin... Gemany for instance has deemed it a private currency. So some Governments are allowing this "threat" to spread. 
Sure I expect some more legislation... probably on vendors so they have to "know the customer" or some shit.
And just to clear things up, the 3rd party payment processors in China stopped about a month ago... so thats not going to affect anything on the 31's.
There may be a dip as people will be fearing a dip... but it will recover and we will see ATH's in the coming months. 
I get the feeling you sold, so good luck to you. You will miss Bitcoin :) 
The way I see it... with Bitcoin its better the devil you know. If a consortium of Governments could somehow quash it, its replacement will be next to impossible to trace.. check out Zerocoin for example.
 They really are better off letting this one fly.

I would say it is already having a big impact on the World stage. Front page of a lot of news websites, newspapers and serious blogs and also debated by world governments. 
Even if it fails Bitcoin has had a massive impact and blockchain technology is here to stay.
It is certainly a high risk 'investment' (if that's how you define it)... I think over time you become desensitized to the risks, so perhaps thats what you are seeing. Last April I shat myslef during the crash... this time the drop was more frustrating, I didn't see Bitcoin going to zero.

It was fairly easy spotting the moment it was about to implode back in April when I made a ton of cash. I wasn't using margin trades or short selling as I'm not really a trader. I also sold everything when I saw a tweet about China cracking down last month. Back in now though.
I'm no professional, but my point is... if you know what you are doing it would be fairly easy to make money trading Bitcoin as it is full of rank amateurs chucking money at it. 
Like I said, I just hold these days as I'm not a trader.

I think shit like dogecoin adds credibility to Bitcoin. Also competition is healthy, we don't want Bitcoin to become complacent... we must continue to innovate.

I don't think you are a fool, I'm fully open to you others opinions. I've had a classical education too... I studied business and am a professional in finance. I'm not saying you are wrong, just that Bitcoin is an experiment and we simply dont know how an economy would work if it was dominant. The current system is not perfect by any stretch, but the last few hundred years have been incredibly prosperous so you cant really say its failed. 
If Bitcoin is the poster boy of the true free market... its not doing a great job. Constant boom and busts and a complete lack of regulation leading to complete chaos. Will this sort itself out in the future? I dont know... I have doubts though. I recently invested in Neo and Bee. They have just frozen trading of shares and the owner has gone awol. That wouldnt happen in the current system as regulations would protect investors. I have zero protection and my investment is gone! I will therefore probably never invest in another Bitcoin business again. Not a great look for Bitcoin and its economy! Its the wild west, and will probably stay that way.

Not really, in the UK tax would be 20 to 40%... some big sellers will choose not to pay these taxes. The big drug dealers on SR don't, so why would these. Sure some will do and that's the great part... you have choice!

Like it or not, if you want Bitcoin to be used commercially there needs to be regulation. There's just no fucking way they are just going to let something as dangerous as Bitcoin to them be used by businesses without regulation.

Without regulation Bitcoin is going nowhere in the US...accept for nefarious uses.

On essentials maybe, not for luxury or certain expensive items. If interest rates are higher the cost of borrowing is higher, it literally prices people out of big ticket items as car, home loans become too expensive. 
What is good about your country never being able to pay its debt? It has to get paid regardless of the interest rate. If the tax due on the debt it greater your taxes will go up. Unless you want your country to default and your currency to collapse... which will make your country a shit place to live.

Its all irrelevant anyway, theres no reason not to have other markets apart from Ebay. I'm interested to see how OB goes... it will be slow to start but is very interesting and could be massive in a few years.

Worked so far... and I only sold all on terrible news. I,e. Gox choking and the price being parabolic and really really bad news from China. Riskier to be holding Bitcoin at those times.

The majority of Bitcoiners are not traders. They are just geeks holding them hoping they will go up in value. The number of traders actually trying to make money are far far fewer than those who play regular markets. Just look at the tiny volumes on the Bitcoin exchanges (relative to stock or commodity markets).

It's completely speculative that they would go to huge effort to scam investors. Read their prospectus. 
Jesus, are you as skeptical of any Bitcoin startups? How the hell are we going to get anywhere without entrepreneurs and investment in the economy. Just by holding and taking no risk sure as shit isn't going to get us anywhere.

If they reenable Bitcoin withdrawals the only way to get the fuck out of Gox is via Bitcoin... so everyone would be wanting them and not many selling... so the price goes through the roof. People seem to be thinking that they are not going to reneable withdrawals though... despite them saying they are working on it! Who knows what will happen!

Of course it means something to me, the vast majority of my wealth is based in the fiat world. My trust in that however is faltering... my country just seems to get further and further in to debt. To get out of that debt the plan seems to be to keep interest rates at near zero and inflate the debt away... which doesn't seem to be working. 
I think you need to realize we are all individuals here. I love Bitcoin, I also love regular government 'backed' money. Not all of us want to replace fiat. 
There is room for both!

Bitcoin is a new beast, at the moment it's trivial for online businesses to know their customers...or for LE to trace people based on their credit card or PayPal account details. Bitcoin makes this harder. The US in particular are unlikely allow Bitcoin to gain any big footing in online commerce unless this issue is addressed. 
The most likely solution has already been suggested... bit licences for merchants. This allows Bitcoins reduces cost advantage to continue, but it means you will probably have to prove who you are when buying something.

@_date: 2014-01-31 07:05:11
Why would a stagnant price have you worried? It's exactly what we need right now! The biggest complaints against Bitcoin is the volatility and that we are in an unsustainable bubble. If merchants see stability they are more likely to adopt it. Long term steady growth is better than crazy rallies. They will however come again, such is the nature of Bitcoin.
It really wouldn't surprise me if an entity is actually shepherding the price right now to ensure us stays around 950. Pretty low volume so it wouldn't be that expensive to buy and sell to keep it steady.

No they dont want to collapse the system, I'm pretty sure they want to be less tied to the dollar though. 
I guess thats where we differ, although I am not a libertarian I dont think the Government have done a very good job... spending far too much on wars, and not being ready for the tidal wave of old people which will cost the economy and taxpayers a fortune in the coming years. They certainly shouldn't be trusted with the money printing machine as they will just use it to get themselves out of debt and pay for services they have promised.

1) Anywhere, a slave would not be allowed to leave their master. 
2) OK, I see where you're going... an organisation could be set up who give their horse free meat badge to McDonalds if McDonalds pays them. Bad example perhaps.. I was just conveying that there are many invisible benefits which we get from a Government who do things so we no longer have to worry (Check for the horse free meat badge) for example. 
Some things are probably better centrally planned and not for profit though?
I'm pretty sure a police force which operates for profit would be worse than what we have now! And no police would be a fucking nightmare. 
I like pondering the views of An-Caps/ Libertarians etc... I just dont think it will ever happen, and I've never heard of a functioning system which operates successfully under the principles.  
You're certainly not going to convince anyone if your opening statement include insults though buddy.

@_date: 2014-03-28 20:02:39
If demand for the new coins is not met in a day (and assuming they are sold) the price will drop. Same as other commodities. Sure we are in a bear market right now, but that's just part of the ups and downs of Bitcoin and will remain that way for as long as Bitcoin is around. I would be very surprised if we dont see a ridiculous bull market this year as we saw last year, and the year before. Stop being to short sighted. If you think Bitcoin is done and over... fine, thats just like your opinion man. 
Bots? Sure... just as any other healthy modern market (commodities/stocks etc.)
I will be buying some more come payday, so I'm pretty sure there is demand at this level. You honestly think the millions being thrown at Bitcoin infrastructure by the venture capitalists and the huge amount of press Bitcoin has been receiving the last six months is not going to lead to a bigger bull market than November or March last year? I think you are very much mistaken. 
Again though, each to their own. You believe what you want, we will believe what we want. I've been listening (and ignoring) you guys for 18 months, and have been absolutely justified in doing so. you're in the wrong sub my friend, spend your energy on something that you enjoy and care about... you are saving nobody from anything and probably only trying to make yourself feel better as you lack the finances or risk tolerance necessary to be involved in an exiting technology such as Bitcoin.

Its pretty cool when you actually take advantage of it. You don't want $500 free? (I am hoping you wouldn't sell it though) You're crazy man... offer still stands.

It's all a very interesting thought experiment, and I respect your views. We can never really know if it would work though can we. The chance of getting rid of governments is slim...most sheep just accept their masters and can't be bothered with deciding on which is the best company to clean the parks and change the street lights. A small country needs to be run on these principles to prove if they work or not.

And the gox thief probably stole those coins over years do they are probably sold already. He's done us a favor really as security will be higher on the agenda for everyone now.

@_date: 2014-03-28 18:33:56
A year ago I could have sworn the US were going to ban it... I'm amazed they have legitimized it by giving it the same standing as a stock/bond or commodity. We are in great shape... especially once we shake the spectre of China's stance and the whereabouts of the missing Gox coins. Both will be resolved this year I believe. 
I would be very surprised if we never see $1000 again considering the money being pored in by venture capitalists. We got to 1000 without them, we can certainly do it with them.

Well to be fair, it depends on which country you live in. I feel pretty safe with my assets in my UK bank. They are even guaranteed by the government up to 85k. 
I also feel much safer having the bulk of my savings in a bank as opposed to Bitcoin. I've seen my Bitcoin holdings cut in half in a single day! ha :)
Banks also offer valuable services such as business loans and mortgages. In fact, Bitcoins economy needs banks to lend money to the start-ups we need.

Well yea, I'm guessing you would get the same if you went into today and wrote... omg! The stock market is crashing! There are a lot of seasoned veterans there who want to talk seriously about the market. They are fully aware of the little dip (one of many in the year) and would find your comments annoying. Swing trading completely speculative irrational assets is a quick way to lose in my opinion. Stick with the one with the most long term potential. Sure some have made gains on nonsense like doge...but you could easily lose the lot. In 5 years which looks like the better bet? Bitcoin by a country mile. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:58:01

I'm pretty sure the IRS can tax it forever. And I don't think you have to have mutually exclusive absolute scenarios to define what Bitcoin will be. It's perfectly capable of remaining a toy of traders and internet geeks. Still a big market...but I don't see it changing the world as you would like it to. I love Bitcoin, but I think an economy based around rigid rules wouldn't allow for any control of said economy. How do you stimulate an economy out of recession or avoid recession with no flexible monetary policy? I don't agree with current monetary policy...buy you need one. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:22:44

Buying something because the price is going up is not a great strategy. What if those who bought suddenly switch back to BTC... you could make a loss.

Shut up, this was just the EBA "warning" from last year... you are talking shite.

The alternative solution is for gox to buy those cheap coins and sell them on other exchanges making all our Bitcoins worth less. This may have been happening.

I heard the same things about what would possibly make Bitcoin worth $100 only a year or so ago...things change fast, and those people have shut up now.
I'm always checking out the alts for any competitors...really looking forward to zerocoin! All of them have a big hill to climb to catch Bitcoin though.
Listen, it's an experiment right...You know that? It could succeed, it could fail, time will tell. To me is is succeeding more than I could possibly have imagined a few short months ago. If you don't want to be part of it, that's cool. I don't get why you bother posting here though...I hate Apple, I don't go to their sub and tell them why I think they are wrong. Spend your effort on something you enjoy and adds value to your life. Hoping for the day when you can derive enjoying from a group of people who lose money is pretty sad. I also think it's futile, as Bitcoin is clearly here to stay.

They can't raise rates, low rates give people incentive to spend and borrow and get the economy moving. Also, if rates go higher your national debt will never get paid

Continued uncertainty is not good for the price...a whale could have got us back to 700 as the volume is pretty low at the moment. 
If Gox announce insolvency and a lot of people lose money the press will have a field day and the price will collapse again. 
We need something good to happen in the coming weeks or there will be a slow grind downward...or sudden if say China decide to completely clamp down.

@_date: 2014-02-23 14:22:25
You don't think Gox employees have their own accounts and can buy Bitcoins at the currently low Gox price, transfer them to another exchange and sell for a profit?
Its an unregulated market, not only is this extremely possible... its probably what I would do given that opportunity.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:03:50
Don't take advice from the circle jerk Bitcoin sub, everyone here is a perma-bulll. 
The market on Gox has shown you like likelihood of getting your coins out by pricing the coins at $100...i.e, they don't think they will be seeing any Bitcoins. 
There are multimillionaire investors there who are more experieced and are more knowledgeable than you or I. Some may even have inside knowledge of Gox's cash flow issues. Take that as you will. 
Its possible that the American Government have fined Gox so much they have no money left, or their crap implementation of a custom wallet has led the the theft of a load of Bitcoins so they dont have enough left to cover the massive withdrawal liability they have. 
Its a huge risk to send money to Gox to say the least.
Saying that, they also may have manipulated the price down low themselves to sell on other exchanges and make enough money to get out of trouble.
Or they may have been paid off by a huge institution to scare the price lower so they can buy a ton of cheap coins. 
All conspiracies... but all possible in an unregulated market. 
Equally, theres a chance they could reenable BTC withdrawals next week... in which case the price will spike to over 1000 in seconds. 
A HUGE HUGE risk sending money there though.

They wouldn't brag about stealing coins from many people who have done nothing wrong. Their intention may have been to destroy confidence in Bitcoin (and they nearly did). A multi pronged attack together with closing SR. Gag orders don't mean you can't speak, you just can't speak about certain details. He would be allowed to keep up the implausible case that he lost the coins. Perhaps we'll never know...but it's not out of the realm of possibility. If it were my job to end the tricky problem of people buying drugs online with a new currency and I had a lot of power that's probably how I'd do it.

It's clearly China, they have a ton off Bitcoin...They drove the whole run up and now they are being stopped from sending money to exchanges so they are selling. The speculators not in China are selling as they know the Chinese will sell! (And are right now). 90 percent or more of people here are speculators, you don't want them all to go!
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:42:47
Well your friends can continue mining pointless alt coins, I just don't see how increasing difficulty would result in the miners who spend tens of thousands on mining gear to want to sell coins for less. The price is mostly driven by speculators not miners. If plenty of good news comes out in the next few months the price will climb.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:40:24

OK, well that's one guys view. I wouldn't say **when** as that implies certainty. 
Anyway, hypothetically what would happen to Bitcoin if we had another financial crisis? Well it could go one of two ways... a flight to safety, i.e, not a ridiculously risky asset like Bitcoin (Gold/ Silver). OR the ramifications of a global depression and collapse of the dollar in which case I think Bitcoin would shoot past the moon and head for Jupiter.

I think given another global financial disaster I would definitely hold on to my BTC.

If that's true in your country I would hazard a guess that house prices are too high? Coupled with reduced incomes. 
With low rates investors are blowing bubbles in assets seeking out some return as its pointless in the bank, that's why the stock market and house prices are ballooning. 
Why is capex expenditure falling? Perhaps we're still in a recession. 
They did what they had to do with QE, otherwise the whole finance system would have collapsed followed by a straight up recession.

There have been about a million posts about the Chinese Governments actions in the last 2 months. Any Government can and will bring in regulations, outright ban, stop banks from having anything to do with Bitcoin, ban merchants from being able to accept Bitcoin or do anything. My point was Governments can have a profound affect on the price and adoption of Bitcoin. 
Some countries are welcoming it, though most appear to be cautious. We need them to "accept" that Bitcoin can be good and clarify the legal position of Bitcoin. Only then will you see multiple merchants accepting it. 
It doesn't hurt Bitcoin, and I'm sure projects such as dark wallet will allow us to be anonymous etc. But engagement with Governments is both inevitable and needed. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:57:17

@_date: 2014-02-16 12:57:40
What? The price is purely dependent on the markets combined perception of what its future worth is. It doesn't matter what price people got in at. 
Today I believe Bitcoin is worth over $600... so I am not selling. If later today I read  a news article of a superior alt being developed my assesment of Bitcoins worth might then reduce to $200... so I would sell. Simple as that, the price the miners sell at doesnt affect Bitcoins price much at all.

Of course it's valid...it's clearly a young technology. For those who can't be bothered to learn how to secure their wallets they will be able to pay or maybe even use free services to do it for them. Storing your silver or gold before banks were invented was probably dangerous too.

Yes, and I sincerely hope this is how it plays out... I'm not convinced of the recovery though and if something comes out of the woodwork in the coming years the US could be in big trouble. The debt will become too big to ever pay off!
I'm no expert, and I may be paranoid... but nobody saw the financial crisis in 2008 so there could be something else that is about to hit. What if China and Russia make a play to get rid of the dollar as a reserve currency? What if they go off for another expensive war over another terror attack?

Inflation is a fall in the purchasing value of a currency... that has not been what has happened to Bitcoin over the last 12 months. I guess you are talking about the number of Bitcoin in circulation?  
 
As for your first point... people get their online bank accounts hacked if they contract key loggers etc. Bitcion still has some maturing to do in this area though. 
Its pretty easy to do cold storage until the technology catches up.

Why do I think the fiat system will collapse? In a word... history. Every single time humanity has tried a fiat based system it ends in collapse. Printing never ending amounts of money and accumulating unplayable amounts of debt is not sustainable. If it is, please describe how the can will continue to be kicked down the road, or how it will be resolved?  
The Romans diluted their gold and silver currency by mixing it with cheaper metals, this eroded confidence in Roman money. History repeats itself and people never learn. It could be 100 years from now, but it is coming. (in my opinion).

Whist fact of the matter is the average Bitcoiner is mid 30s. And those kids annoy me less than folks such as yourself who seem to derive pleasure when things take a downturn for Bitcoin. It could fail, sure...but if we never tried new and risky things humanity wouldn't progress. Bitcoin could help the unbanked in Africa, it allows 100 percent of a donation to go direct to the person you intend. Ignore the negative greed and see it can bring good to the world too.

The financial crisis was caused by poor regulations allowing lending to people who could never afford to pay it back... then the wrapping up of that bad debt into complex derivatives. Those activities should be stopped, having high interest rates prices even people who do have good regular incomes out of the housing market. The system should work well, if greedy bankers aren't allowed to be immoral. 
If people are given incentives to save you literally will never get out of a recession. If interest rates rise the interest due on the national debt will never get paid... that debt is going nowhere, so we are stuck with low interest rates. 
I'm not a fan of huge Government, but we are stuck with them... I think the free market could actually do a worse job in many things we need!

Bitcoin was once considered a joke, now its being taken seriously by PayPal and the Bank of fucking England... yet you still cry, its a scam! 
Keep going mate, it falls on deaf ears. 
I think your type are mostly the risk adverse who regret 'not getting in early'... and perceive that it is now to late. That's fine, if its too late why don't you just fuck off?

You need to learn about the concepts of inflation and deflation. The usd suffers from inflation, meaning a dollar next year buys less than a dollar today. Bitcoin is deflationary...a bitcoin last year buys less than a Bitcoin today. The rate of currency supply of Bitcoin doesn't make it inflationary as the exchange rate is not fixed vs other currencies.
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:40:30
Best and quickest way to learn is to have some skin in the game though. They're not idiots, it takes a fair amount of intelligence to figure out how to buy and store Bitcoin. Sure many have no experience of markets...I hadn't 18 months ago. Bitcoin introduced me to it all, I now have a stock portfolio and own some commodities. The experience has been nothing but positive. I think people can grow from the experience of panic buying and selling even if it costs them money. More experienced traders exist in all markets. I'm not a fan of the to the moon shit either...but each to their own. This sub was crazy long before November!

 In the UK police don't carry firearms and that works well. Criminals are then less inclined to arm themselves...hence less deaths. I am aware the military kill innocent people...but they are necessary. For example a seals team rescuing hostages from pirates will needs guns. It's not a perfect world...I just think gun ownership should be kept within certain professionals. Even there abuses will happen. A world where every man and woman owns a gun would be terrifying...every highly heated violent dispute could escalate into a shoot out! More children would accidentally die when they stumble across daddies gun and murders would be at epidemic proportions.

Yes, but as nobody knows where it's heading in the short term...assuming you are not in this for short term gains, holding is the best strategy.

Treating it as a commodity is fine by me... a year ago I could have sworn they would make it illegal. Its not a foreign currency, its more like a portable gold. The rules can change as I doubt very much that many people will report their tax liability and its probably irrelevant for small everyday purchases anyway. 
People can claim the tax losses, and if you do get taxed it means you made a capital gain so got the good cheaper than you would have with cash anyway!

Because I want Bitcoin. The short term price does not bother me, and I don't enjoy the stress of day trading. If I wanted fiat I would have sold...but I see Bitcoin as having a big future and it's a hedge on the coming inflation from all the money printing that has yet to hit the folk on the street. My paper wealth could be taking a hit in the next few years, so I have diversified. The trolls here are so short sighted. I have no problem with those who want to sell and take profits though...each to their own.

I am fully aware that the coins you are trading on screen are not coins... the digits merely represent coins.
Hell they could just pretend to sell a load of coins with fake sales to drive the price down!
Mark could easily however set up an account and buy a Bitcoin now from MtGox for less than $300 send that Bitcoin to Bitstamp and sell it for $600. 
He then sends that $600 back to his account where he can then buy 2 Gox coins for $300 each. (just for examples sake). Each time he doubles his money!
People are still selling coins on MtGox! And only Gox employees can withdraw them! If they are indeed insolvent this would be a very tempting way to make enough money to cover the $ liabilities they have. 
They would still owe the same number of Bitcoins as they bought them with their own money. 
If they dont have enough Bitcoins as they have been stolen, then they are indeed in trouble. Mark however has a personal stash of 250000 BTC apparently so he could use those.

Don't think I'll be investing though...sounds even riskier with less reward than Bitcoin.

Solid reputable exchanges are clearly in development...and you'll see some regulated American ones pop up later in the year. 
Yes, it's a silly community here...which is why I'm even more amazed you spend time fighting the torrent of Bitcoin pumpers. Go to Bitcoinmarkets, you'll get a better quality of retort from intelligent investors who have invested more money than many of the people in here.

They don't need a third party service, they could just type in a few thousand fake sell orders to get the price low and buy with dollars...then sell on another exchange or pump the gox price back up and sell. Unregulated markets can be hilariously manipulated...especially if gox needs money

It won't be the official solution as no government wants to adopt another countries currency. If people lost confidence in the dollar the US would probably try and make a new currency...but you'll have a long period to get thorough with an unstable / useless / hyperinflating dollar. It may seem far fetched...but all fiat currencies in history have died to date. No reason to believe the dollar will be any different.
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:30:37
Never say never... you shouldnt judge a man when he is only a boy. 
The price will stabilize once a decent economy is formed underneath... which is happening. Dont be so short sighted... do you really expect it to grow linearly with no volatility,  or just materialise at a stable rate?

Yes the collapse of the dollar would affect the world, I fail to see how this is related to the debate. If anything global instability would drive even more people to Bitcoin and Gold as they are independent of nations. 
Empires have come and gone (Roman, British etc.)... they didn't leave the global economy screwed. Sure there will be turbulence, but just like after World War 2 the world would brush it off and adapt. And inevitably someone else will have a go at being top dog. 
Its arrogant and short seighted to think Americans will always be the leading nation... I would say their peak was the moon landings. Its just downhill from now on, being crushed under a mountain of debt. $60k per American citizen and climbing. It will possibly fall in your lifetime... which I am looking forward to!

I love Bitcoin, but if I was only allowed to invest money for my retirement in one thing it would be the stock market not Bitcoin. 100+ years of history shows it's pretty safe compared to Bitcoins history. You are probably going to spend many years being retired so you will need some income.
@_date: 2014-01-02 08:12:06
To those left behind... like my grandparents, parents and non geeky siblings. Saving instead of spending is not good for an economy, thats why interest rates are so low at the moment... to reduce the incentive save. 
We could debate this all day, but you are correct... what will happen will happen regardless! I think BTC has a big future as online cash and it will be huge for the underworld and criminal element. 
 I cant see it replacing any currencies though.

These problems will sort themselves. No need to start again...You will have the same issues to deal with. Wallets and security will improve, insured storage for example. All your issues just show that Bitcoin is just a baby. Let it grow before you cast judgment. Regulations are coming which should also add to the safety of Bitcoin...this is still very much the wild wild west. I love it!
The only real problem which you mention which may be hard to overcome is the association with drugs...that's a brand issue I guess. But your hypothetical replacement might also be tarnished with the same brush. I'm sticking with Bitcoin!

I love Bitcoin but if we controlled the currency of the country how would you stop recessions / depressions? There could be no monetary policy as it's already decided. You can't slow inflation or stimulate an economy. Because it's deflationary there's actually an incentive not to spend which would retard the growth of the economy. It's a useful alternative tool...it's not something you would want as a national currency. There were valid reasons for coming off the gold standard.

I'm not going bankrupt pal, I sold a few hundred near the peak of the April crash. I've read comments such as yours for a couple of years and they are all tired variations of the same. Those who said exactly what you are saying even a year ago now feel stupid...be mindful you could feel the same in the next year. This sub is a bit of a joke and I'm not a fan of the dreamers posting expectations of 100k a coin. It's an experimental and pretty cool technology and nobody knows where it's going. As always it's either going to zero or it's going to an insane amount. You have made your stance clear but basing that on very short term data is pretty short sighted. Zoom out and you will see the most likely scenario are more and increasingly large bubbles and pops. One day I believe it will stabilize though.

Lots of people care about privacy. It's the natural successor for Bitcoin on the dark markets. Bitcoin is already associated with those things and is doing fine.

If we knew the answers to those questions we would either sell all our coins or sell our homes to buy coins. Nobody can possibly predict the future.

By checking account do you mean bank account information? Sorry, Brit here. 
I'm guessing their head office is is the UK but their banking is in Europe due to the potential future regulatory issues.

@_date: 2014-02-22 08:03:57
I think the answer is fairly obvious isn't it. Of course we consider the dollar/euro/pound value of Bitcoin when purchasing something. In the future when (if) Bitcoin stabilizes in value we will have a sense of how much a Bitcoin is worth in terms of purchasing power in it's own right so we can then indeed price in btc with no need to reference another currency. We are a few years off that yet though. Companies reference dollars as their costs are denominated in dollars.
@_date: 2014-03-14 23:01:15
I'm no gambler son, the gamble is not holding Bitcoin when it's blatantly going big in the next few years. Glad I'm not a risk averse luddite. And don't worry about my retirement buddy...got that shit more than covered already :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:41:31
And some Governments will do that... but Bitcoin is global so it doesn't really matter. Making things illegal sometimes makes it more expensive (see drugs for example). 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:53:03
I buy things with Bitcoin if a company actually accepts Bitcoin... problem is that is fairly limited right now. The bet being, more companies accept Bitcoin in the future. This appears to be happening. 
I don't see a problem with hoarding Bitcoin... this is just the same as 'saving' of regular money in your bank account. 
As for trader.... I have no problem with that either, it adds liquidity to the market. You seem to complain that people save Bitcoin and complain that people sell Bitcoin. Make your mind up! 
People trade all kinds of things, if they can make money (Bitcoin or FIAT) fair play to them.
Bitcoin NEEDS to get to (at a guess) north of $5000 per coin before we get any sort of stability and merchants see it as less risky. 
Without greed Bitcoin wouldnt have gone over 1 cent. As Gordon Gekko said "greed is good".
The early adopters (which we all are) take on huge risks and may get rewarded for that. The poor guys on Gox took on too much risk and paid heavily. 
Some may have kept their Bitcoins on gox through "greed", others ignorance or naivety. Lesson learned... store your own damn Bitcoins. Lets move on!
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:45:35
I wouldn't call it micro management...You are taking about a whole country. None of your links relate to the UK. Right now you can buy cassacius coins, asic miners. To be fair you see less actual Bitcoin for sale these days. I stopped selling as like most folks I prefer to hold these days.

I know, and its silly to think that 13% of potential gold buyers would choose Gold. Saying that, I hold Gold and Goldbugs would 'get' Bitcoin I believe. 
With Bitcoin being officially recognized as a commodity in the US I think the future is exiting though as it gives people options. I think that ruling hurts it as a currency in the US though.

Buyers aren't subsidizing anyone. They want Bitcoin, and miners want to sell Bitcoin. That is called a market.

I think for anyone who has been around Bitcoin for a while... they will be like myself, quite calm about a little drop. I cant see it getting lower than 550 (on Bitstamp). 
Only because the Chinese news was worse than this and we bounced back from that. I'm not selling as I may miss out on the rebound. 
Gox isnt dead yet, they just need to get their shit together with withdrawals. 
Russia is one country who probably weren't big using Bitcoin much anyway

If you want mainstream adoption yes you need regulation. Few businesses are going to want it if they don't know where it stands legally.
If you want zero regulation, you want Bitcoin to remain in the shadows. Who knows, could still be massive.
Bitcoin itself can't be regulated, but it is still reliant on banks and exchanges and merchants so it can be regulated at those points.
If you think regulation in the US is not coming I believe you are naive. Lack of regulation caused the 2008 financial crisis, and the US are Hell bent on stopping anything that could be used by terrorists. No chance they will give Bitcoin a free pass.
@_date: 2014-07-09 09:24:18
Whilst I agree things are in decline...empires take hundreds of years to collapse. It's in Bitcoiners interests to keep people fearful of the markets /economy collapsing. But the reality is, the US has had a worse debt to GDP ratio before (after the war) and recovered. Japan is in a worse situation than the US is yet still keeps going. The stock market will crash again, as it has crashed before...long term it's proven a great place to save for your retirement. Trying to convince young people that Bitcoin is a better bet for their future is ridiculous. With an aging population and low interest rates I think the markets could get even higher over the coming years. 
Sure stick a few hundred or thousand in Bitcoin as a gamble, but don't bet your retirement on it. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:02:09
Bizarrely I wish I had fewer Bitcoins back then as I probably wouldn't have sold them all! By the time we were pushing past 250 I had a lot of money on the line!
I was convinced we were heading to zero as I hadn't been around for previous bubbles. My few frustration posts before deleting my account were probably just me trying to convince myself I had made the right decision. I loved Bitcoin and felt that it popping proved the critics right that it was perhaps a ponzi. 
Psychology is so interesting!
Anyway, yep! 'm back... out of student debt, started a pension, bought a car and got some stocks and gold with my profits, and I still have some skin in the game :)

@_date: 2014-02-02 10:07:56
I'm not from the US, but I see your point. I love Bitcoin, but if I had to bet my entire savings or retirement fund on something...It would have to be FIAT rather than a 4 year old new asset class. The best way is to hedge both maybe with some precious metals if you are expecting a global meltdown. The internet might stop working in that scenario too.

True, as long as it works out cheaper than using bitstamp I think they'll do well. Not too mention the London stock market boys may be more inclined to get involved with a native exchange with what sounds like solid security.
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:00:59
My Bitcoins are still worth 1 Bitcoin each. I hope I never need to trade them for FIAT and I believe their purchasing power will increase against FIAT considerably over the next few years. So their value to me hasn't changed. If you're just here to speculate and make dollars then you're correct.
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:04:19
The value of Bitcoin has very little to do with what it costs miners to find them. The cost of mining hasn't changed this week...yet the price has. The price is purely what the market deems it to be.

Thanks, I knew the Milli.... I never use micro in my day to day life though, or nano so I'll probably never get a hold of it. Bits (or a singular alternate nick name for the sub units) are very much needed. 
1 million Bits is far easier to understand than 1000 uBTC ... they are equal aren't they?
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:18:02
Most currencies have two 'units' ...us Brits have pounds and pence. If Bitcoin had Bitcoin and one subdivision it would reduce barriers to entry and you world feel like you are actually getting something if you can only afford a few nanobits.    
You're being pretty optimistic if you think we'll be pricing in satoshis anytime soon. How does your preferred system scale...You have a new name for each decimal? 
Yea, meters, cm, mm are easy to understand... mbit, cbits, ubits much less so. Probably because the come after a decimal place, it's completely alien to think like that and I have no conception of how much a nanobit is worth if buying something.  I doubt this will change due to the die-hards like yourself who thinks it all makes sense...It's just going to scare people away though.

Not really, a completely inflammatory post trying to evoke a response from some poor folk who have money stuck on an insolvent exchange. That's not funny man. 
Bitcoin isn't broken, gox just claimed they had built a custom wallet different to the reference client. It was just a cover for their insolvency though. The only part of Bitcoin which may be an issue is the deflationary nature...It could lead to continual boom and busts. Can't see anything better on the horizon though, so I'm sticking with Bitcoin. You need the speculation otherwise it world never have grown to the extent it has...And I believe we're just getting started. If I got you wrong I'm sorry...but your post comes across as trolling, not humorous.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:40:57
I felt the exact same way that Bitcoin was doomed to fail last April and sold all my coins... big mistake and had to buy back in. 
Sure some people have insider knowledge that I do not have, but none of us know the future. I doubt many saw the Chinese Bitcoin boom setting off the last bubble... and nobody can predict what the catalyst will be (if any) for the next. 
I see Bitcoin like a gamble... if you have taken your money off the table thats cool, you may be right. You may also be very wrong and we will only know in the years ahead. There are only really two scenarios for Bitcoin... a big fail or a big success. We don't know which one it will be. 
I agree with you that you shouldn't take everything at face value from this sub... its still a fun place though. 
Your predictions of Bitcoins death have not turned out to be correct so no need for the gloating. Also be aware that after you sell your coins you will look to justify your decision (I posted posts similar to yours in April), so you may not be acting rationally yourself. 
I thought the Silk Road bust was the death knoll for Bitcoin, turned out to be the start of the bubble. This Gox shit could be the same. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:37:17

You may or may not have more Bitcoin than me, I dont care. If it keeps taking off I have more than enough. 
You really didn't need to be extremely wealthy to by multiple hundreds of Bitcoin 18 months ago...and it saved me the effort of mining the stuff.

Because you generally can't link an address to a person, unless you have resources like the nsa who could obtain records from say an exchange and track that back to you. Projects such as dark wallet and mixers however do let you be anonymous with Bitcoin. Also, zerocoin is on its way which should be fully anonymous if you want that sort of thing.

Sorry, we get a lot of trolls here. Nobody knows when or if Bitcoin withdrawals will be reenabled. The market believes they are insolvent so don't have any money and may soon close. People are worried and selling their coins as legally they have a better chance of getting done some of it back.

But they're two separate things aren't they? I can see that banks give less loans if interest rates go up, contracting money supply. But the government creating money is a different process isn't it. There is no opposite to quantitative easing is there? They just slowly debase our currencies?

Yes banks offer a useful service, I like banks. They also however nearly lost all our money and plunged us into a global depression in 2008... so they are not all saints. 
I've had excess money taken off my debit card which was more than 15 minutes to fix. Bitcoin is like cash, if you lose your cash nobody is there to save the day. You have to be responsible, but like I said the market is there so solutions to make this aspect safer are on the way. bitcoin is still a young technology. 
One advantage of a flash drive, is that I have multiple copies of my wallet! (cant do that with your regular money wallet!).

Uncertainty as no fix has been issued yet. One is coming and the panic sellers will become panic buyers. We don't want the devs to rush though. If you have been around Bitcoin for any length of time you will understand and trust the talented devs.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:14:52

Less fees, less restrictions on what you can and can't buy, the ability to spend and receive bitcoin for goods and services. Of course we don't need it, we don't need eBay... but let's let the free market decide if it is wanted. I like the concept, unhindered trade and exchange is interesting.

The price is tanking because of China, I for one hope they fucking ban it so we can move on...  with the millions of VC capital and better exchanges popping up daily. You think its over? fine, I'm not trying to convince you otherwise. No need to gloat though... many have done the same as you over the last couple of years and lived to see they were very very wrong. I personally think we could dip some more then head back up in the coming 6 months or so.

 The past month of relative stability must have been pretty frustrating for a trader, so I can forgive you. 
I handle my business in real life just fine thanks, Bitcoin is just a bit of fun to me as it really could go to zero or the moon, I couldn't really care.

@_date: 2014-03-03 18:53:54
Yep panic buyers as they want to get in before the price runs away... the polar opposite of the panic sellers following the Gox news for example. 
Volumes look OK to me... where are you looking? I guess people are scared to be holding too many coins on exchanges right now so that might slow volume a bit. 
And your last statement is a bit of a no-brainer. Bitcoin is either heading to zero or a ridiculous figure you cant even comprehend yet.

They are fully compliant with Cypriot law... and if I read correctly, people have the private key to their Bitcoins so they cant shut up shop and steal peoples money. 
People in Cyprus hate banks as they all had money taken off them last year after their accounts were frozen. Neo is offering a safer place for their savings, much of which is kept under mattresses. 
Our savings in our banks are being stolen too... by printing a fuck ton of money our savings are being devalued. Bitcoin is an answer to that.

I've been in Bitcoin for about 18 m,onths... the last couple of weeks I have been wanting to buy more Bitcoin, but I'm fucked if im doing that with the uncertainty of Gox hanging over us. Now that is gone (going), the market can settle and I can buy more coins. 
The price had largely factored this in anyway, now the other main exchanges will have to become more transparent about their BTC holdings, the dev team will have to release a patch for the maleability things and other innovations such as decentralized exchanges come one step closer. 
This has been a major stress test of Bitcoin over the last month or so, almost an attack! And its still pretty damn strong considering! Looks like we will be launching the next bubble off a 400 - 500 base... that is pretty damn good. 
Sure the press will slate us, but many here dont give a fuck what they say. Bitcoin thrives on controversy... its like Eminem in his prime!

This...I although I'm in finance, I work in a company with a lot of IT geeks and they are the most hostile toward it. It's because IT is 'their' field and they didn't see this coming. Bitcoin isn't just a technology though, it's more.

Do you have a link to someone who can explain it well? I don't understand the contracts thing...if I have a contract to pay someone $10000 and they do the job for me, how does ethereum force me to pay the guy?

Maybe they were stolen over a long period and have already been sold. 
Maybe it was a government organisation which has control of the wallets. 
Seems beyond ridiculous that this fat retard could have lost all those coins. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:16:05
Be careful what you wish for, recent news...regulation, Russia and a very uncertain China, could push the price lower. 
Especially if speculators such as yourself are getting bored! If you knew the price was never going higher, would you sell your Bitcoin?

I was just trying to explain with an extreme example of why it could cause inflation. I don't think half of Americans will use Bitcoin. 
I think many here would agree that the fed printing money will lead to inflation as the money in your bank becomes worth less. (Do you agree?) 
Bitcoin adds to the monetary supply just as additional printed $'s do!
Its negligible at the moment as the market cap is so small. 
Instead of just throwing out "you're an idiot" why don't you try a well reasoned counter-argument?

Fair points, I guess its a matter of time-scale though.
As for the pound, its probably a different currency completely these days. Since the sterling pound was introduced its been debased, made of silver and backed by gold etc. So its only the same in name. I get your point that many are replaced, and thats probably what will happen to the USD. Ultimately the world will probably have a universal currency in my opinion.  
I'm just talking of Bitcoin / Golds usefulness if that transition to a replacement currency is not chosen (as was the Euro) but forced, maybe due to debasement or severe lack of confidence.

A year ago it was $20. This is far from over, even if it dips a little bit more... dont lose faith as those did last march when it looked like it was heading to zero.

If Bitcoin fails, I'm probably exaggerating that I would leave crypto. I think I would wait for something better than litecoin though. It offers no advantages over Bitcoin and has none of the venture capital thrown at it either.
Zerocoin maybe... or some other coin which comes out in the future.
Definitely not litecoin though.

People are fearful that they will never get their money or Bitcoins out because Gox may be insolvent... I don't think that saying was meant for this situation.

Hindsight is 20:20, I sold a few hundred in April... of course I wish I hadn't now but you can only make decisions based on the information and your feelings at the time. If Bitcoin goes to  zero tomorrow that would have been a call. 
The only thing that matters is today, this second. Posting about it does not preclude the chance that it could go vastly up in value. 
Even those who have made a million may have sold too early! Nobody knows what the future holds.

And how do you define the market price? The market price when it closed was in the 100s. Are you saying if the market price goes up to 5k in the next six months their liabilities increase? The liability should be the number of Bitcoin owed or the cash value when it closed.

Lots of people do things for free. The mods here for example. No idea how well it works, cant think of anything like it in existence. I imagine it will work on reputation... if one gets bribed and acts badly, nobody will trust them. The free market in action!


Of course, if people chose that route they would have to be careful. Lots of drug dealers have big income and don't get in trouble just because they buy nice cars. 


Do you have a link which says this was a false report?

@_date: 2014-02-09 15:03:50
Well it is the savings passed on to you from the merchants (less PayPal, visa costs) which would benefit you. If it's not cheaper then don't use Bitcoin. Merchants also benefit from less chargeback...again more savings on to you.
Bitcoin comes into it's own for buying online services like vpn's or companies you don't want to spam your email address or send you junk mail. Some of us just want some privacy back!
 I'll continue to use credit cards due to the protection it gives me from fraud. Bitcoin is just another tool for certain situations...I can send micro payments to artists I like, I can send value to a friend for free for example. Can't do that with PayPal, visa etc.
If you don't have use for it, don't use it.
I've had PayPal freeze my account and even my credit card company ring me up asking if the transaction I'm making is ok...I don't like that, I like to be in control.

Well it's not entirely bullshit is it, Bitcoin opens up a world of money laundering and nefarious possibilities. (See silk road).
If I had a wife and we divorced I could hide all my money in Bitcoin! 
It also makes blackmail much easier.
Regulation is a good thing if not overdone, the merchants we need are more likely to jump on board if they know where they stand legally. I agree, if they over do regulation it could kill it in the US however.
Libertarians, or those who prize anonymity will have to move to zero coin or something unfortunately...maybe dark wallet and stick with Bitcoin.

No I mean like the company that people would presumably pay to police the area (though not police). If my home got burgled I would expect that organisation to track down the thieves. If they can't catch thieves their company would lose the contract...there is an incentive to catch thieves as they are set to profit. This could result in setting up innocent people up or planting evidence. The group would not be impartial as they are operating for their own gain. I'm not saying existing cops are any good...I just don't see how it would work.

In the early 90s you would have thought that was all too complicated and wouldn't catch on...far too nerdy.
 Times and technologies change.
I remember thinking people with mobile phones stuck to their ears looked stupid and out of place.

The guy disappeared and stopped paying his staff. Sounds like I bought shares after the alleged theft. The threat to his daughter, sounds like nonsense. It just all sounds like a scam. Spend all your money on advertising with no real idea of how you're going to get money...raise a ton off easy marks (us) then fuck off and claim you lost it all on some website.

Bitcoin isn't mainstream so no. But it has definitely taught me a lot about how markets work, and I'm more interested and better equipped to deal with less risky and speculative commodities.

Agreed, I think the price on stamp will remain fairly stable...but we'll see a rapid rally on gox, to the point of being higher than stamp! By the time they get their coins to stamp or others the desire to sell will be diminished...unless they want out of Bitcoin completely.
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:47:59

Yes, it would be tempting... and I can see how this spiralled out of control. It doesn't excuse it though. People have lost millions and there are (or could be) suicides relating to these losses. I guess the rapid growth of Bitcoin caught him by surprise meaning his BTC liability grew quicker than the money he was making by trading.

Yea, its an arms race for sure. As processing power increases to crack it, so does the power to encrypt it. So you will need an infinite amount of power to render encryption obsolete! 
The NSA can only ever gain a small window of superiority over a target... I guess playing devils advocate, if they dont work toward it someone else will.

I have no intention to sell any.

Everyone is so short sighted with their views on Bitcoin... briefly hitting 700 today is irrelevant. Yes, its a crap store of wealth at the moment... it should stabilize when its $4000 plus and has a decent economy of businesses underneath it. This is happening (overstock, Neo &amp; Bee for example)... do you think there will be less Bitcoin businesses in 12 months? Thats pretty naive... millions of venture capital is being thrown at Bitcoin startups. 
All of the existing alts have the same problem... no network effect. 
I agree Bitcoin has a bit of an image problem, as is expected for something that was born in the internet underbelly. 
Plenty of work being done to clean its image up though as regulations are on the way. Though they wont hinder the other use case scenarios I have detailed. 
fair play, you have at least done some research into the topic so you are not your run of the mill troll. 
You're welcome to the laugh... are you here for enjoyment or saving us fools? 
There is literally nothing you can say which makes me doubt Bitcoin has a big future ahead. It makes me laugh actually that people such as yourself spend so much time arguing against it! If it has no future what the fuck are you wasting your time for posting all the time? Have you nothing better to do?

I won't be kicking myself just as I'm not kicking myself for not selling my house and buying Bitcoin 2 years ago. You can only act on the information you have available at the time. Right now doge just looks like one of the many rapidly expanding alt coins backed by a semi amusing subreddit. I don't think that is enough to catch Bitcoin if I'm honest. Bitcoin is being debated by the largest governments of the world, it is on the cusp of exploding. The others in my opinion are just side shows. But good luck to you...If it gains any traction I might throw a few Bitcoin at it in a year. There are alts on the horizon which show much more promise though...see zerocoin.

Link to him stating as fact that Gox was solvent please?
Even if he was confident that Gox would sort its shit (like I was)... doesn't detract from his integrity and competence. Nor does it imply that NeoBee is some sort of elaborate scam.
Like any start-up it is extremely risky, and I am fully aware that most start-ups fail... especially considering its such a new field.

So giving an opinion deserves being blasted? It's not even a prediction as op calls it. Tech may not be his strong point, but he's certainly qualified to give an opinion on Bitcoin from an investment viewpoint, economic viewpoint or it's legitimacy as money. He wouldn't be 'surprised' if Bitcoin isn't here...me neither, it's turning into a cult!. 
I'm just saying too that this sub is ridiculous sometimes if anyone says anything remotely against Bitcoin. And calling for some respect for the guy is not saying he's a God (although in the investment world he basically is)
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:38:44
Gox is a big deal, and I don't think it's over. Some traders in r/bitcoinmarkets sold at 720 and put large shorts on which they have probably closed out by now. After I read the press release I sold a few...but bought back in when I read the rebuttals from the devs. Gox purposely crashed the market in my opinion.
Still surprised by Bitcoins resilience. Now we need some good news or we're sliding down.

@_date: 2014-02-08 20:31:38
Viable? Yes...very risky at the moment? Absolutely! You have large exchange risk because Bitcoin is very volatile. If you intend to trade $s for btc then btc to $s you may also lose out on exchange fees...You then have to transfer the funds from the exchange back to the second bank account! In the future it may well be an optimal way of transferring funds as you may just be able to hold Bitcoin...but only when the volatility dies down. If Bitcoin is a success this could be a few years off yet.

Fully agree, if people dont want to buy drugs there... the drug sellers will stick to the traditional markets such as Silk Road or any of the others. 
Will the fact that dodgy stuff is sold there put people off buying legitimate goods? Possibly, but possibly not. In the early days I remember seeing clearly illegal goods on Ebay... it didnt stop me using it though. 
It wont bother me, especially if I can purchase the things I want at cheaper prices or with better service than other markets.

@_date: 2014-02-10 23:21:47
No we cannot agree on that... you clearly have no understanding of how markets work. It is a zero sum game, for every buyer there is a seller. Whilst the exchange makes a little fee. Everyone gets what they want. 
If Gox are insolvent it means they used clients deposits or even sold their Bitcoin and spent the money. 
There is zero evidence of this. 
I suspect the delays in cash withdrawals are because of strict AML restrictions and overwhelming withdrawal requests. And we found out today that their custom wallet software is buggy. 
That is all. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:53:52
If they don't allow Bitcoin or regulate so much people can't be bothered to use it...it will be replaced by another coin which is impossible to trace (see zerocoin). Better the devil you know...they have the blockchain to follow with Bitcoin.

I'm a Brit too, I don't find it hard to buy Bitcoin from bitbargain or bitstamp. They're only unknowns they have no feedback. In a company that sells IT with 150 staff, I am the only one who holds Bitcoin though... how do you know the UK are still buying?
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:51:44
Absolutely, monetary policy helps stimulate an economy out of recession and slow it down when its overheating. It needs to be managed correctly though. Gold and Bitcoin cant do that so would be poor over a long time, they would however be useful should people lose confidence in the currency. People are going to get sick of the dollar if it is excessively inflated so the Government can pay its debts which I believe will be the problem. They will look elsewhere to maintain their wealth, further reducing demand for the dollar. Case in point, myself who have diversified into Gold and Bitcoin. I may be wrong, my Gold has been crap but my Bitcoin has done well (to date)... I consider both a hedge. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:29:06

@_date: 2014-02-08 15:56:03
That is not a contradiction...if early adopters want to sell their BTC and make FIAT profits thats fine by me. I sold many and have made FIAT profits in the past. So fucking what.   
I still hold Bitcoin and will not be selling them as I believe they will gain purchasing power. 
Bitcoin is different things to different people, I too once used it as a tool to make fiat profit... and I regret that! The two views are not contradictions... people can do what the fuck they want. 
Do I really have to say I want to be rich? Who the fuck doesn't. That is however not the main reason I hold Bitcoin. It is however a very possible outcome and a deserved one considering the risk involved and the constant bullshit you have to read from people such as yourself. 
If you think its a Ponzi scheme fine, who the fuck cares. Don't you have anything better to do than troll on a subreddit about Bitcoin? Or are you one of the saviours who hopes to save people from losing money? If so, be aware that if people had listened to you guys even 6 months ago they would have missed out some massive profits OR growth in Bitcoins utility / purchasing power  (depending on your viewpoint). 
Come back in 12 months and gloat all the fuck you like if it flops... more than likely you will be warning people that it cant possibly go higher than $4000! 
You are short sighted, ignorant and a troll. 
The early investors in internet technology probably had to endure the same shit... yet many are laughing now and their detractors are kicking themselves for not seeing something that is revolutionary. 
If you have no use for Bitcoin, cant see how being able to send large value for cents is a game changer, or a just jealous you missed the boat then you really need to stop hanging around here as the rest of 2014 is really going to be upsetting for you considering the amount of venture capital that is being pumped into Bitcoin startups. Those people dont invest in Ponzi schemes, and Governments are also clearly seeing it for what it is (hence the regulation that's coming in the US to stop money laundering). The fact that Governments have to try and regulate and take it seriously legitimises it in my opinion.

Sure Bitcoin services could offer insurance...but again, in most situations I'll just use my credit card. Settles instantly, free (I pay it off monthly) and it's insured.

You are right...but the demand for those coins has been reduced by a lot of fallen comrades on gox. Many will want nothing to do with Bitcoin any more.
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:50:49
They have stopped Bitcoin withdrawals. Many people believe they are insolvent...that's why the coins are so cheap. It would be very risky to send money there. If you can afford to lose your money and are a big risk taker you could get some cheap coins. The market seems to think that's not going to happen though.

I don't think this is a golden age of sheeple, people are more informed of subjects than ever. 


Correct, to steer an economy you need some flexibility in the system. Gold nor Bitcoin can offer that. I'm not claiming the current system is perfect... it gives TPTB the ability to inflate away their debts (not fair), I have seen no better alternate though. 
Bitcoin is great, I love it... but its more of a commodity than a currency to me. If I need one day to transfer wealth to another country or make some micro-payments I will use Bitcoin, maybe for fringe items like VPNs too. For everyday commerce, I don't see the point as current systems suffice and offer me protection from fraud.

I would honestly be surprised if we didn't see $600 before the end of the year...really surprised. Since the first time it i it that it's been recognized and classed as property in the us, had millions on venture capital thrown at at with services currently being decrypted and deployed, we have dropped cancerous elements like Gox (currently  dropping china) and had some big merchants accept Bitcoin. Those hundreds of new ATM machines will be selling Bitcoin like hotcakes shortly :). But sure, you just concentrate on the short term China situation and knock yourself out trying to mock people if that brings joy to your world.

Bitcoin introduced me to the libertarian philosophy...I find it intriguing and it has made me question many of my beliefs. I'm not sure how successful it would be in the real world though. I also see Bitcoin as a testing ground to see if a free market world will work. So far the results are mixed...but it will be interesting to see how it pans out. If crypto fails I think it will hurt libertarianism as it will be the go to example of the shit show that happens with less government regulation. Conversely, Bitcoin could show that we don't need our masters so much.

I agree, no currency can last forever. But fiat has been good for humanity for generations otherwise we would still be bartering for silver or swapping pigs for cotton! 
The problem is the policy of printing money which has gotten out of hand and I agree is an experiment which we don't know the outcome of yet. 
Saying that, Bitcoin is also an experiment which we don't know the ultimate outcome of. A deflationary currency could just promote hoarding (I hoard)... so nobody spends and you have continual brutal boom and busts.
 That wouldn't be too good for economic prosperity. 
I have my feet in both camps.  There's room for both and I don't see the majority of people switching to BTC, simply as they don't need to. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:28:57
Don't be an idiot. r/investing is an awesome sub, they really are not going to give a shit about some kid knocking up childish memes. Cool your erection just because bitcoin is flying. It would pay for you to diversify into non experimental asset classes. 5-7 percent annual returns is nothing to be sniffed at. Slow and steady. Bitcoin could climb to 5000 then drop to zero. You won't be retiring on that.

Ok, why choose PayPal over visa? They both offer the same thing. My point is there is room for more than one method of payment, pick whichever you like.
 You reject the possibility that merchants will charge less for products paid for with Bitcoin...But that is the main reason Bitcoin will be a good way to pay for things.
So this argument is over already.
Cheaper products with Bitcoin is a future scenario anyway as Bitcoin is still a baby. Don't buy any and check back with us in a couple of years.

Exactly the same could have been said about the April bubble... and yet just over 6 months later it blew up again. The next bubble will be even sooner than 6 months.

But seriously, would you want to live in a country with no government? Sure anarcho capitalist have some interesting theories...but they are just that. You think the free market would produce a better place to live? Gox was an example of what the free market does...it fucks up. The 2008 financial crisis was due to a lack of regulations. I don't agree with all their laws and I would like to see a more hands off approach by government overall. As for Bitcoin, they have been extremely welcoming of it in my opinion! They have recognized it as property, or so commodity which is logical. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 06:25:07

Also, Index funds are highly unlikely to go to zero. Bitcoin could go to zero or way way lower than it is now. Index funds are considered risky... Bitcoin is basically speculative gambling.

If you can afford to lose it, go for it. 
To me Bitcoin has two possible outcomes...either $40000 plus per coin or zero in a few years. There's no real middle ground. With that in mind, you really don't need that many for a great return.
I don't see the point of adding even more risk by throwing money at mtgox. 
Even buying one Bitcoin at the current bitstamp reduced price will get you an awesome return.
Sure the heard may be wrong on this one and you could get some cheap coins...but the fact that you are asking if it's a good idea shows you are not really that informed on the situation so perhaps it's a bad idea. From the UK you are looking at 3 days to get funds there...by which time the coins could already be 1500, or they have shut down. 
Good luck whatever you choose. I give it 50/50 :)

I find the premise interesting, I'm just not sure a country without government would work. Can you give me an example of a successful country with little or no government, or who operate a more free market approach. There were not enough regulations stopping people sell mortgages to people who could never pay them back which was a major contributor to the crisis. (Weird derivatives then masked all the shit debt). In a world with no regulation you would have that crap happening everywhere...people getting scammed left right and center.

Bitcoin is basically gambling.

Well no, I didn't expect Gox to fuck everyone over to the extent they did...and I doubt you did either. Still the price is surprisingly resilient. I'm in this long term so it's all part of the journey, rock n roll. I did sell a load as soon as I read that press release, but panic bought back in after it started to rise again. Trading is not for me. Well done if you positioned yourself well...but still, gloating and boasting is not cool and pretty evil really.

Except Bitcoins growth will be much. much faster (if it survives) due to the speed we can all learn about developments (this sub for example!) and share ideas, and there is a financial incentive to buy Bitcoin! 
The infrastructure already exists to an extent for Bitcoin to work (mobile apps, the internet)...and where it doesnt we know what is needed and how to build it. When the internet was evolving many new services and technology had to be invented. Bitcoin is a much simpler system so development will be more rapid. We already have electronic payment systems like PayPal and credit cards... its just a matter of swapping those out for Bitcoin. 
If you had told me 15 months ago that hundreds of Bitcoin ATMs would be deployed I wouldnt have believed you! I think things will move on quicker than any of us can envisage.

I don't give a shit, adoption may be a bit slower without the isheep. Pretty sure Android and others can take it all the way. If you want to be free and use Bitcoin then don't use Apple products...simple. Apple haven't bothered to innovate their toy phone for years anyway.

Except that is on one exchange. If you are going to troll at least be informed about the subject or you're no challenge. You don't need to withdraw your money with Bitcoin as you are your own bank...that's the point of it you idiot :) 
So what if some kids claim they will become rich (although many have)...just let them dream man. I don't think I'll be rich...although I've already made a large profit. And so I should, I've taken the risk and got the reward. Also had to listen to hundreds of tools like you over the last 18 months who have all been proven wrong. And so will you old man.
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:11:53
Ethereum is relevant to Bitcoin, hypothetically you could make a contract with your Bitcoin in escrow. When said contract is complete the Bitcoin is released to the counterparty. It doesn't have to be Bitcoin, but it's the obvious choice and brings potentially amazing things to the world of Bitcoin/crypto. If you weren't closed minded you would see that it's not a competitor...so calm down and let your little brain learn something instead of circle jerking and being a tool.

Market cap is a completely misleading metric. Ripple is bigger if you use that metric and that has a tiny volume of 74k per day. Market cap is just the price of the last coin sold x the total supply. As doge has like a billion (or unlimited?) It's not surprising.
Fastest growth ever? Bitcoins price grew 9000 percent last year...has doge beaten that?

Well crypto currencies have yet to prove themselves, I wouldn't call them a particularly good store of value yet. Bitcoin specifically is also too deflationary to be of use as a national currency. (I still like Bitcoin though) 
They majority of money banks deal with isnt actually money at all though is it... its debt which they just create in a ledger and lend out. Crypto would be no good for that or making that transparent. I'm sure you will see our debt based economy as bad and that crypto is the answer... but how could we stimulate the economy out of a recession or slow it down if its overheating with monetary policy, interest rate adjustments and money supply adjustments? Bitcoin is too rigid, as Gold was too rigid... thats why we came off the Gold standard.   


I agree, that would be nice.

You are not motivated by get rich for doing nothing schemes?
OK, well that presumes bitcoin is such a scheme. Germany who declared bitcoin as private money and the bank of England who saw fit to write a report saying it 'could' destabilise the UK's money seem to not think it is a 'scheme'. 
I inherited a boat load of money a while back and encountered a few people who disliked me for 'getting something for nothing'. It's human nature I guess... Yet I bet if you could go back in time you would buy a few thousand bitcoin wouldn't you? 
And sure, there are equally intelligent people who both support and dislike bitcoin. Same as when anything new and groundbreaking comes along. 
Why not just enjoy the show? It's absolutely hilarious sometimes. For the record, two years ago I thought it was a bull shit scam and I did just buy mine to make money. Now I use it and have spent two years reading around it, learning about traditional economics in the process I can see that it is pretty awesome. It has flaws sure, but it's for real.

I guess the hope is that once Bitcoins value is high enough it becomes too costly to manipulate big swings and cause volatility. Also, in the future there will hopefully be a large economy underpinning Bitcoin so then you will know that say 40 bits buys you a banana. 
I don't think you can say "The promise of bitcoin as an escape from fiat and central banking is a fallacy " as Bitcoin is too young to judge in that regard.
Sure a few people who took on the costs and risks have made a ton of money... just like early Gold miners I imagine. That doesn't really change anything.
"What does it offer over something like Google wallet"
* You don't have to give anyone your email or other personal details.
* Its global so there are no forex charges and you can just pop over to other countries and use it. 
* Google or your bank cant freeze your account.
* No Government or Bank knows what you are buying!
* There are others, just read around a bit!
"How can the network keep up with more adoption than it already has? "
The protocol can be upgraded, it may need a hard fork. 
This is an experiment and nobody knows where its going. Bitcoin is still relatively young so needs to mature. I see it as a tool that doesn't replace fiat but it is still useful in certain scenarios.
If fiat suits all your needs, don't bother with Bitcoin.

I find techies to be the most sceptical. They feel as though they should have 'seen Bitcoin coming'. As they did not, they perceive too that they are too late to the game.  They therefore need to validate their lack of foresight by hoping it will fail. 
Non-techies just don't care about it, they have no use for Bitcoin as VISA, paypal etc serve their needs. It is these people who feel don't care about the NSA or see how it affects their lives. They are also happy with the status quo, so why change. 
I think both are good though, what we need now are more merchants accepting Bitcoin that more Bitcoin speculators. All these guys can jump on in a few years when their are simple and secure apps to use Bitcoin with.

I sold my stash at the peak in 2013... Then had to buy back in a year or so later! I'm not interested in small, short term gains. If you enjoy it, and a haircut doesn't bother you... Then go for it. You might do well. If the market tanks in 2017 without hitting well over 2k to me that would be a change in trend. The trend being ever increasing boom and busts. If it crashed now, it would just be a simple repeat of the last crash... Not a continuation of the trend.

If betting that bitcoin will drop below $1000 is a costly bet, why take it? It's only a couple of hundred (potential gain per coin). If Bitcoin is successful it's going to be worth multiple thousands per coin... And can swing up just as fast as it plummets. Recent news regarding the ETF decision has made me more optimistic... And it's only a couple of weeks away (perhaps next week even). I can't be bothered with the stress of watching for that decision to buy back in. If you've got hundreds of coins, sure, go for it with some coins. If not, and you believe in Bitcoin, I don't think the risk is worth it. Pure guess, but I'd say we'd smash it to $1500 should the ETF get the green light. Once that's up and running, who knows how high it could go as hedge funds and very wealthy people pile in. Good luck whatever you do mate.

Well yea, I've been a Bitcoiner for a couple of years so you won't see any tears from me I'm afraid mate. A little sad that you get kicks that way, but each to their own I guess. 
Well anyone who knows what they are doing would know this is an experiment, I myself am very interested to see how a truly free market (with no Government intervention) works. 
To date, its been a mixed bag... and a great fun ride. 
Will Bitcoin overcome the issues you state? Who knows, I don't think closing markets to 'cool off' is a good idea, or even needed. 
Likewise market manipulation by someone to keep prices stable is not needed either. 
I guess I'm hopeful that if Bitcoin succeeds it will get to a high enough value that it will be too expensive to manipulate. 
There wont be a stable price until their is a mature economy underneath it either.
In short Bitcoin is far too young for you to claim any absolutes about how it "cant be fixed". 
Enjoy your childish kicks from people who may have lost money here.

Thousands of dodgy hidden services still function unhindered, if they could take them down they would. Having exit nodes does not mean they have compromised it. They are obviously trying, but the only success they appear to have had was from an old fashioned browser exploit after someone probably clicked on a dodgy link. If you're careful and use the latest version I'd say it's still secure. You may disagree and neither of us can really know for sure. If the NSA have compromised it then it's pretty immoral to not close down a load of kiddie porn sites if they have that capability.

@_date: 2017-02-25 11:10:27
Sure, this is so unpredictable you might be on the right side. I don't think bitcoin has enough history to see trends though. The last bubble didn't crash after it hit the previous ATH... It carried on going a long way higher. If history repeats itself, this bullrun is far from over. In times of trump and Brexit, I think the ETF might just go through... If so I think we could see a $200+ jump in a day. Seems like everyone is holding their breath right now. You may be right, you may be wrong... But like me, if you've been here for a few years, none of us can really lose :)
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:40:32
Well you can be a bit of both my fried, I hate banks after they fucked the world pre-2008 (and ongoing?)... and I have certain libertarian views (I want less Government intervention in my life). 
But I do also however want to make money for the risk I have taken here. In an ideal world I will never have to convert my Bitcoin to FIAT as I will be able to spend it on things I want. 
I also see it as a hedge should the mismanaged $ collapse in the coming years.
I think both types of Bitcoin supporters are OK and we can live together as we love Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 09:03:39
If the rule change allowing the ETF gets approved, I personally think we'll see a much higher (and very quick) uptick than $100. I lucked out in 2013 and sold just after the top. However, hodling has served me well since. Bitcoin is too young to know that selling only at ath is a good strategy. The train could leave whilst you're all cash... Forcing you to buy in at much higher prices. If the ETF isn't allowed you made the right decision. Time will tell. If Bitcoin is a long term success, making a few thousand now by trying to time the market will be pretty irrelevant, and the downside of having fewer BTC is much higher, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-11 08:49:14

Ok, in your world where I'm guessing we pay the police directly (with gold?) to enforce a few laws which we've all magically agreed upon (unlikely)...what happens if the police force decides to abuse the power we have given them? 
How do you even agree on laws? 
Also, what do we do about people who don't want to contribute to street lights etc? 
An economy run with Bitcoin would be crap, there's too much of an incentive to hoard and not spend...a little bit of inflation is an incentive to spend and keeps the wheels turning. Gold would be a crap currency too...there's not enough of it. 
I think it's natural to have an entity with ultimate power...you see it in nature, alpha male monkeys etc. A pack of monkeys with no leader would be uncoordinated and inefficient and probably be bested by a more organised pack.

Yes, its almost guaranteed (and basic economics) that there will be future market crashes. But really, your money doesn't go poof!. You still have a house! If you dont sell the asset at the bottom, most markets invariably go back up. Even if you bought whole market ETFs at the top of their peaks, over 10 or 20 years you would still make money. 
Why on earth would Bitcoin trickle down if fiat doesn't trickle down? Humans by nature are greedy. Money is money. 
OK the USA is only the 9th richest country in the world (Out of a lot of countries)... with a $54,630 GDP. Not bad. The average standard of living is far greater than the majority of counties and very high compared to our ancestors. Sure some people are poor, but thats just the nature of a world of limited resources. Bitcoin cant solve that. 
Without a well funded Government your country would quickly devolve into a shit hole. Without their ability to expand and contract the money supply, your recessions would be longer and there would be continual boom and busts. 
I agree war is bad... Bitcoin isn't going to end any wars though.

One world currency would be pretty bad... Look at Europe and the Euro. It works for some of the countries, but having a singular monetary policy isn't ideal unless each economy is in sync. Also, even if Bitcoin did become that currency, you would probably have even worse inequality than there is now! You and i would become the richest people in the world!

* Its infinitely divisible. Gold is not... gold will never again be a usable currency.  
* You can store Bitcoin in your Brain! Gold is heavy and cumbersome. 
* In the future there are all kinds of possibilities that Bitcoin could make possible. How about a smart wallet which belongs to your Son... but only allows them to spend the funds on their 18th Birthday? How about Micro-payments? Everytime I watch a Youtube video a micropayment goes directly to the content maker... no middle man. 
How about hiding all of your wealth from a Bitch ex wife?
Really, I think the best stuff probably hasn't even been thought up yet. The world is going smart... AI, Home automation etc... there will be use cases for an internet currency we cant even comprehend yet. 
Its very easy to look at the state of Bitcoin at the moment and write it off as being too volatile, too full of speculators etc. I did the exact same thing years ago. And maybe it wont amount to shit in the long term... but what if? In my mind, this is either going to zero... or bigger than most could imagine. If you're in the former camp, fair enough. But you cant know for sure! Lots of very smart people wrote off the internet and even PC's once :)

That's fair enough, I agree! There's no reason Bitcoin shouldn't act like other asset classes. Clearly you get people buying simply because the price is going up! I find Technical Analysis interesting... perhaps it holds more weight for an asset such as Bitcoin as the fundamentals are far less obvious. 
Personally, I don't trade. I'm just a 'Hodler'. I tried to trade Bitcoin once, but my emotions were hilarious. I panic sold, panic bought and lost about $3000. Holding is my strategy as long term Bitcoin 'Might' be something special.

People have been telling me that since Bitcoin was $8. 


Correct... its not a currency at the moment. Its acting like a commodity. 
Despite buying most of my coins in 2012, I bought more today... why? Because I'm betting that Bitcoin will become a useful currency in the FUTURE. 
If you cant see that, that's cool. Its not a certainty... neither will it 'inevitably implode'.
What if, in the next 5 years a small (or large) country gets into trouble with hyperinflation? Bitcoin would be a lifeboat!
A lot of Bitcoiners, hope that we will never need to sell. Because one day it will be a currency accepted in many places. 
The fees really aren't that bad... and again, with the planned LN and things like Schnorr signatures, those fees will come down. 
You're being a little short sighted.

Well I for one would not want to live in a country where my pay would go down each year. Deflation usually follows recession, and compounds it. Investment slows down, vendors liquidate stock at cheaper prices as people are reluctant to spend. Why buy something now if it will be cheaper later? 
The US had to come off the gold standard to combat the great depression... it also enabled the US to help its allies defeat the Germans. That was a war that was worth fighting in my opinion. 
The vast majority of economist agree that getting off the gold (deflationary) standard was a good thing. Who are we to argue. 
A flexible money supply helps steer the economy... A Bitcoin economy would be utterly shit during the inevitable bad times. People would hoard and there would be continual boom and busts. Sounds familiar?  
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:15:46
Fractional reserve banking? Sure, banks can 'lend' out more money that they have on deposit. Basically 'creating' money. Its a good thing, as long as regulations are in place (which they are)... to stop banks over extending. 
Central banks can also expand and contract money supply, which is how they steer the economy... to stimulate us out of recessions and slow us down if we're growing too fast. It gets more complicated, and I cant be bothered to write loads as its late. I'd like to waffle on about how money and wealth are different etc.. just cant be bothered :)

I guess you could argue that all currencies eventually fail or get replaced. Surely the dollar would simply inflate to a 'trillion dollar note' sort of thing... it wouldn't go to zero.

My wages go up each year at a greater percentage than inflation... and millenials are the first generation to be worse off that their parents... so we are generally wealthier than ever. (I'm gen x) 
Boom and busts would be far far worse if central banks had no capacity to extend and contract monetary supply to stimulate an economy out of a recession or slow it down. 
I dont think Bitcoin would end wars, if anything it would create massive inequality. Us "early" adopters would be ridiculously rich and the latecomers ridiculously poor. The current system on the whole works well... a Bitcoin world would be a step backward to something which has failed already. 
That's not to say Bitcoin isn't an interesting asset with a couple of useful properties. Its just not going to replace fiat or stop wars.

Totally different really. Trezor is probably a small outfit of only a few people. Perhaps they have to work through the night to get all the orders out.

I've been down that rabbit hole thanks. Mike Maloney is a Gold salesman. Enough said. I know how they're different... there are very good reasons we don't back our currencies by Gold any more. It is not 'greedy bankers' or whatever nonsense gets thrown around r/btc. 
Bitcoin would be a terrible currency to run your economy on. Its an interesting asset though. 
Buying Bitcoin is a pain in the ass... I have to send my passport to an exchange send fiat through the existing banking system. Buy it, wait for it to be returned to my wallet. Stress-fully store it without any insurance if I lose my Keys or get hacked etc.

Inflation is good for an economy, there is an incentive to spend (because items will be more expensive in the future). Inflation also makes it easier on debtors, who then repay loans with money that is less valuable than the amount they borrowed. This encourages borrowing and lending, this again increases spending and investment... fueling an economy. 
I love Bitcoin, but it would be shit to run your economy on. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 21:35:45
My savings have only suffered due to low interest rates... not inflation 1.2% in Nov according to your link. 
To be honest... its not difficult to beat inflation with your savings. I get 1.5% in my Santander account and 3% in my tesco accounts. 
Other savings you could lend out on Zopa or invest etc. 
House prices are excluded from inflation (rightly or wrongly)... but they have gone up largely due to migration and an aging population. Admittedly they have been used as investments, and why not? If you have capital and can make money buy offering a service to someone who needs to rent?
I guess you're upset with capitalism? I guess I'm the wrong person to be talking to as it works quite well for me. Others? Not so much. But thats just the system we have. Socialist or Communist regimes don't do so well. Could it be fairer? perhaps... but how do you suggest that happening?

So? That would only matter if you were 100 years old and kept your money in a zero interest account. Most people get pay rises and invest. Inflation is a good thing, it incentives people to spend (as things will be slightly more expensive in the future). It also encourages borrowing to spend and invest (as the repayments are less in real terms than the amount borrowed). Inflation helps grow the economy. It's why we came off the deflationary system of being tied to gold. Don't buy the hype around here... Current us inflation rate 1.7 percent. Hardly "robbed blind"

Bitcoin is just full of people like me who hoard it, expecting it to go up in value as newcomers poor money in when the press go bonkers. My mum and friends want to drop in money despite not knowing what the hell bitcoin is or how to buy it. (I decline helping them)  It's massively manipulated too. With zero regulation you can't tell me that people at exchanges aren't front running big moves. There's no perfect money system I'm afraid. 
I'm from the UK, I don't think the cost of living has doubled in 15 years here... And even if it has, my pay has increased significantly... And I am wealthier than I was 15 years ago. Fiat works well for me, I don't want to switch to a deflationary system. Deflationary systems are not good for economies... History shows this.
Also, if QE caused inflation, we would have seen hyperinflation by now. We've averted a depression after 2008, so QE worked to an extent. Yes, your national debt is high... But compared to GDP it's been worse, so don't stress too much. Fiat has got quite a few more decades yet.

I'm plenty old enough to have long term experience of inflation my friend. I work in finance and track my monthly spending... and to be honest, of course my outgoings go up each year, but so does my income. My lifestyle has not been noticeably diminished.
I'm not a fan of inflation... but it is part of the engine which keeps the economy growing. Deflation would be very bad. 
I very much doubt the real rate of inflation is 5%. I'm assuming you're american. Lets say the Government has lied to you and inflation is not 2% ... if its actually 5%... all Americans would be around 25% poorer over the last decade. I don't see that... there would already be riots and people dying of starvation.

1.2 is not huge if your target inflation rate is 2 percent. 
The RPI was 1.6 as of December... as long as I'm getting more than that I'm cool (I am)... So my purchasing power isn't going down each year. For the last three companies I've worked for annual pay rises beat inflation. They've been at least 2 percent. My latest company was 3 percent.
If you're not getting that in your "wage slave" job... Change jobs or careers.
I agree, housing sucks for most people (I live mortgage free)...
In 2016 houses rose 6.7 percent. Are you saying your wage should rise inline with houses perhaps? That also means it would drop with house prices ... In 2008 you would have had a 16.2 percent wage drop!!! Would that be fair to people who have already paid for their house? Nope... That's why houses are not included in inflation rates.
It sucks for people not on the ladder...I wasn't for years. Must have spent 80k to some fuck of a landlord. However, it also left me flexible. There are benefits to renting to. 
House prices are a supply demand equation. The population is growing and it's hard to build new houses. I have some land and it's next to impossible to get houses built on it due to neighbours objecting and a need to maintain the countryside. 
Perhaps move to a cheaper country? Or get a better job?

That's not my understanding of QE. That "money" doesn't go to rich people. Sure, it pushes interest rates down... That causes the stock market to rise. But that's a nil sum game. Some rich guys win, some lose. QE does not cause inflation.

Well the world is still recovering from the great recession. Where poor regulation enabled US banks to lend to people who couldn't afford to repay the loans. It wasn't all bankers, it was just a shit, unregulated system. Lessons have been learnt. It's actually really hard to borrow for a mortgage here in the UK now. This is not a fault of the monetary system... It was a regularity problem which had largely been fixed.
I don't think the world is about to collapse, shit was way worse during the world wars and we came through that just fine. The biggest problem is an aging population. OK, maybe trump is a new problem you yanks have given the world ;) but no, it's not money or bankers. That's a tired old argument.

They have been around for years and amassed great wealth from the interest they charge on the loans they make and wise investments they make themselves.
 FWIW, lots of banks are closing their physical building where I come from as nobody uses them any more. 


People aren't born with lumps of capital, so you have to utilize the services of banks and pay to borrow money. With luck you can turn that borrowed money into more money than the principle and interest you pay back. 
I have worked for numerous medium sized businesses, many use loans and overdrafts for cashflow...  yet still turn a profit at the end of the year. Without borrowing, they would not exist. 


Because they offer a service which people are willing to pay for. Without a bank loan I would never have been able to afford my first car when younger which enabled me to drive to work and build a successful career or fund my studies at uni. 


You're speaking very generally there... lots of people have plenty of money. Sure there is a gap between the haves and have nots. And there always has been. Kings and peasants. That's not the banks fault... its a mixture of luck, genes, life decisions and hard work. 
Again, you are generalizing about people owning cars back in the day. Cars were cheaper, but so were average wages. 
A quick Google gave me the price of a Model T in 1906 as being $360 with the average salary being $708. So a car was 50% of an average salary... not too different to today.

Then it must also insentivize investment, research, efficiencies and progress too. Which I would argue is our only way out of this mess. Musk wouldn't be making electric cars for little profit. If we'd stayed on the gold standard we'd be a few decades more primitive... Still burning coal for heat! A simple Google will give you endless reasons of why deflation is bad, that's why developed economies shoot for mild inflation. I have no intention of spending bitcoin as I believe it will be worth more in the future. If anything all the electricity to run the network is a net negative for the environment.

It probably is being used to an extent to flea capital controls. But that just means buying it in one currency and selling in another, or gold. You'd have to be fucking retarded to keep a large proportion of your wealth in Bitcoin given its volatility. Mostly it's people who see their coins appreciate... Buy more, the price goes up. Then the bubble pops. It's pretty fucking obvious that's how this works. And it's a good thing... If this wasn't exciting it would probably never have taken off.

Ethereum has potential, but its still very experimental, and I've not really seen any game changing smart contracts yet. I don't see it being used as a currency or digital gold as Bitcoin is. 
Litecoin? Not really sure of your logic on this one... the only way I could see that gaining any traction would be if a fatal flaw was found in Bitcoin. Even then, Bitcoin would be replaced by something far less similar to it than Litecoin.

He can spot every top with his mystical chart reading. He looks for pointy bits, sells then buys back at the bottom bits. It's so obvious I'm amazed we hadn't thought to look at these charts ourselves. Timing the market works so well in Bitcoin. 
That or he'll be feeling shitty for the next few months.
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:40:33
Fuck me this is getting sad. I have no intention of promoting bitcoin with family and friends. I choose the massive risk of bitcoin myself. I don't want friends or family to lose money... You know... Because they are friends and family. 
 No wonder people think this is a Ponzi scheme.

It's a good thing for me I meant. For me to be wealthy, others must be less wealthy. That's just the way it is. I want to be filthy rich. 
Adjusting prices down for the economy is not a good thing. Deflation is bad, just Google it and you'll see why.

Its more like a commodity... sort of Gold 2.0 than a currency at the moment. I don't think of Gold as a pyramid scheme. 
One glorious day in the future it might be widely used as a currency.. but thats not really true or necessary at the moment. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 16:52:03
Thought so. I've been down that rabbit hole. Made me very negative and filtered everything I read through the lens of Doom and Gloom! Luckily I got out and things aren't that bad. The US debt to GDP ratio has been worse, certainly possible to get it down. And at the end of the day, you need debt... its how the system works. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 04:56:05
So you've traded all your fiat for bitcoin at the moment then? Pointing at a few outliers doesn't really mean fiat is shit. Bitcoin has collapsed spectacularly 3 times since the few short years that I've been involved too. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:06:42
No doubt, some may be using bitcoin for that reason... However that just means buying bitcoin in one currency and selling out to another. Nobody with any sense would store a significant portion of their net worth in Bitcoin considering its volatility and ability to go to zero at any point. The only echo chamber is this sub. "Buy the dip" "cheap coinz!!!!" Etc. Very few people use this as a currency. If we see 1300 in the next 12 months I'd be amazed. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:10:31
At least post the link correctly
@_date: 2016-12-27 08:22:37
How about if it's use case is simply a commodity, digital gold. Is it not possible that bitcoin continues its long term trend of bubbling up and crashing every few years... Each time reaching higher heights. Until, it reaches a price where it becomes so expensive per coin than individual or even groups of traders can't move the market so easily or manipulate it. With that reduced volatility wouldn't it then become an interesting store of value? It would be like gold, but much easier to move around the world. Even now, can you not see that someone in a country with capital controls and a tanking currency might see a use case for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:45:36
A lot of people on here have far far worse 'regrets'. All you can do is act with mindfulness at the time. 
I sent 0.3 Bitcoin to a girl once just to show her how the technology worked... she lost her private key. 
I think I sold 25 Bitcoins to my brother once for £300. He sold them later to buy an xbox. 
Anyone holding a significant amount of Bitcoin from 2011 - 2013 has to have hands of absolute steel!
If it dropped to zero tomorrow, you would have made a great choice. 
If it doubled next week you would have made a bad choice not buying some now. 
Its a random lottery... don't beat yourself up. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:25:39
I'll tell you what you want to hear. Sell your coins, lock in that sweet profit. Bitcoin will drop soon... So what if it's jumped 30 percent in the last month... It's impossible to keep going up... Impossible! You can always time the market and buy in when it drops 20 percent at the Chinese new year. You'll feel very clever when you buy in a bit cheaper before bitcoin takes off again! You won't immediately feel regret or keep compulsively checking the price.

Who the fuck knows what caused it. A mixture of some of those things... Then the hype train. Rinse, repeat. Long term I think things could be really good though... Or zero. Nobody knows, don't get upset about it though. It's pretty obvious looking at the history that this is one turbulent bitch :)

What history are you referring to?
@_date: 2016-12-24 13:05:24
Lol, there's nothing wrong with the pound, and we have low inflation so I don't think we'll be forced to use a deflationary currency like bitcoin anytime soon. Deflation is bad for economies, that's why we dropped the gold standard and promote mild inflation. A common bullshit fact thrown around here is that QE causes inflation... It does not. Sure, in a hundred years maybe the pound will be switched to a government controlled crypto. No way the economy will run on it though. 99 percent of bitcoiners like me hodl not spend. It's like gold, not money.
@_date: 2016-12-24 07:07:47
Oh really. I live in an advanced economy in the West. I cannot spend bitcoin in a single place in my city. It's a pain in the ass buying it. Even if my employee agreed to pay me in Bitcoin, my income world fluctuate each month depending on if bitcoin is rallying or crashing. Google wallet is way way easier than bitcoin. It also uses my credit card so if I get my money stolen...I get it back. Bitcoin is a shit currency... But a great commodity.
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:58:13
I prefer low cost tracker funds than a few single stocks. Less risk and more diversification across sectors. Nothing wrong with a small holding of bitcoin for the adventurous though. The potential upside is mind blowing.
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:47:51

Fair enough, however I'm neither young nor new to bitcoin... Bought a load in 2012. I've heard arguments either way... Both sound convincing. I'm not bothered with the technicalities or the politics, I just think the current state is a bit shit and has been for a while. I guess to sum it up I need to wait longer and trust it will all work out? Seems at the moment anyone with 5 spare bitcoins can grind the whole thing to a near standstill by spamming... That's pretty crap.

Fuck me man, if you've sold out withdraw your cash now. You don't know what you're doing nor are you emotionally equipped to be trading bitcoin.

Don't need to look it up mate. Been using paper money successfully all my life... as did my father and grandfather. Not sure what your point is. As far as I know, the dollar is not 'backed by nothing'. I guess you have swallowed the nonsense from here that QE causes inflation?

Ah, a cheesy meme that thinks governments are going to let bitcoin replace their own currencies. I see. That's mostly to pump up newcomers here so they 'invest' all their "worthless fiat" pocket money. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 08:10:22
Just out of curiosity, if your own currency started tanking and your country enforced capital controls, wouldn't you even consider putting some of your money into bitcoin? Sure it's volatile at the moment... It's still young.

What? Sorry mate...I don't understand you. I obviously want a strong native currency as my assets, salary and overall economic wealth of my nation depend on that. I also want bitcoin to grow to ridiculous prices so I can swap back to GBP and retire. That's what most people want here I'm guessing. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 07:27:53
I have no need or intention to use bitcoin as a currency. My assets are denominated in £s, I'm payed in £'s, my cities shops all take £s, only one shop I buy an annual purchase from online  accepts bitcoin directly. Google wallet is awesome, I just swipe my phone and I'm done. I can also do bank to bank transfers for free. There is no benefit of swapping to a very volatile currency. Bitcoin is a speculative bet, I don't want to spend bitcoin, I want to hold it in the hopes that it raises in value and I'll be rich one day. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:44:42
They haven't lost anything, unless they sold now and lost a few dollars. I'm pretty sure most people could weather a 120 dollar (or so) "loss". You complete and utter bell end. As always, only invest in Bitcoin if you can afford it and if you realise we are either going to zero or fucking moon. I was reading shit posts from poor, butt hurt, risk averse losers like your since bitcoin was only a few dollars. It was the same argument back then...that's it's worthless... Yet here we are at nearly $900 you blind luddite fuck
@_date: 2016-12-24 04:12:17
The vast majority of people in the developed world don't need bitcoin. I can tap my phone at a checkout and money is instantly deducted from the account my employer puts my pay in. They're not going to be arsed with registering a passport with an exchange, transferring money trading it for bitcoin. Setting up a wallet and learning about encryption and change addresses and cold storage etc. There's no need. Fiat works great. As a commodity it may gain traction with a few more risk positive investors... Certainly not mainstream though. In less developed countries it may have some uses if their own currencies are failing them. But I doubt it will be getting into their mainstream conscious this Xmas either.

I read it. As I said, I have no intention to spend my bitcoins. Like the vast majority of people here I'm holding it as a speculative gamble. When I have spent it, it's a pain in the fucking ass to buy more. Last time the exchange wanted a copy of my passport and gave me a questionnaire about what the fuck I wanted to spend my bitcoins on. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:07:25

Yes, I would make a bet that we are not over $5000 in the next 12 months. You're dilusional if you think it's worth that much with its current user base of basically just us speculators. If they ever fix the number of transactions, and we can go 6 months without an exchange hacked... Maybe in the next 5 years. Maybe.
@_date: 2016-12-28 09:00:54

I bet you watch Doomsday preppers and read books such as "The collapse of the Dollar". 
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:35:41

I'll give you both. If you sell and lock in that sweet profit two things could happen. The price will go up and you'll feel bad or the price will go down and you'll feel smart and happy. If you zoom out on the charts, both could happen so nobody here can give you that answer. Just ask yourself... Will the price of bitcoin be zero or 10s of thousands in the next decade or two. There's your answer. I view my speculative investment in Bitcoin as a sunk cost... It's all or bust. Anything else will just result in you stressing or asking random fucker's on the internet for advice. Most here simply want to pump bitcoin... Think about that.
@_date: 2016-12-10 07:34:32
Have you done so?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:44:28
That's what makes this so fun. Nobody knows. Could go way higher then crash. Could just tank from here after an exchange gets hacked or some rumour starts that China or someone is going to ban it. The drama is worth the cost of a bitcoin alone. It also teaches you a ton of things about how trading, risk, supply and demand, money etc work, which can roll over to your other finances. I would never have been interested in equities if it wasn't for bitcoin. Long term price prediction is either: Zero, tens of thousands per coin in the next decade or continual boom and bust until you get bored. I was an emotional wreck after my first bubble... This is my third and it's just fun now. If anyone knows the price of bitcoin tomorrow morning much less any sort of accurate prediction for the future... They're talking out their ass. Buckle up and enjoy the ride
@_date: 2016-12-27 08:55:05
Have no idea what your shoes are like so nobody can give you a decent answer. Not to mention you are asking on a circle jerk forum where we all own bitcoin. What's you income? Savings? Other investments? Age? Risk tolerance? What do you consider a "chunk of change"? A few hundred? A few thousand? Tens of thousands? At a more general level of advice... Only invest what you are willing to kiss good bye too... This is highly risky and speculative.
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:58:31
Oh I don't know, trying to deter these shit posts. It's a stupid question as we don't know his financial status, risk tolerance, how many coins we're talking or basically anything. Considering he's dithering and appears to have no strategy he's better off selling and taking his gain. That's based on the limited information he gave me. Nobody knows where this is going... My guess fucking huge or zero. Any number in between is irrelevant and not even worth getting emotional about, freaking out over, stressing or posting shit memes every ten minutes. Rant over
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:09:36
Yes, you should sell. You obviously don't know what you are doing. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 08:48:13
That's essentially the problem isn't it... And I'll only deal with that problem when we get there. I would sell the day they're worth enough for me to retire.... But greed is a mother fucker. I've basically written off the money I have in BTC though, so if it goes to zero I'll be fine.

So does this woman's lab/company use the bitcoin blockchain? 
@_date: 2016-12-24 04:19:48
Coming off the gold standard was largely a good thing. A deflationary money system is actually pretty crappy. If we all used bitcoin right now we would be deferring purchases of non essential or big ticket items (a car for example) as we believe it will be cheaper next week. That is not good for an economy, that's why they build in inflation...A small nudge to buy things now or invest. That's not too bash bitcoin. It's an interesting commodity, and certainly has some use cases. But don't swallow all of the rhetoric that gets spouted here. I did, years ago...I went down a rabbit hole of anarcho capitalism, I read books on 'dollar collapse' and even started watching doomsday prepers! But in reality, fiat isn't all that bad. It's served me well for decades and will continue to do so. I love bitcoin too though... Wouldn't want my economy based on it though.
@_date: 2016-12-24 22:50:20
Very promising my ass... who uses Monero? nobody. No I don't trust my politicians, I very much doubt the UK or US will be seeing hyperinflation anytime soon though (If ever). 
Bitcoin is deflationary. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 09:55:53
Yea, I read into anarcho capitalism. Sounds like something that could never actually work though. People are too greedy... Roads and public services wouldn't work as people (not everyone, but many) wouldn't contribute without legal obligation. GBP is working just right for me right now, and I hope it continues to do so, so I can live a nice life and retire in safety. BTC has its uses, but it's an alternate to gold not a usable currency. Deflationary currencies suck for functioning economies.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:33:25
I'm guessing you mean you have to sell it? Well thats not really contributing to its failure, as presumably someone will be buying it from you.
The end goal is for it to be a massive (decades long) bubble... and owning it as money will be just as useful as selling it for (your regular) money. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 20:16:42


I couldn't give a shit about the price, I made a small fortune in the 2013 bubble and cashed out hundreds of BTC near the top.. I kept a few back hence why I still frequent this sub.
I also learnt a ton about money, markets and even my own psychology and tolerance toward fear and greed which have helped me with my more regular and less risky investments.
 


Which Government? I'm guessing you are being pretty US centric there with your thinking. The World is large and has many Governments... I doubt all Governments are going to ban Bitcoin. Numerous have been openly acceptant of it. 
And really, how can they ban it? They cant stop it being spent on the dark net as it is. 


No idea mate...hopefully a long time. Considering what its trying to achieve (a Global currency) I would still class it as young. I bet the internet was a bit shit when it was only 7 years old. 


Likewise, apart from snarky people or trolls who seem to think 'Bitcoiners' are just one generic type of person. 
You should buy a small amount, if you have a stake in it it makes it a lot more fun. 
Look, its a gamble man... 50/50. I hate the guys on here who pump it up ridiculously as it embarrasses the majority of us. 
I dont want Governments to fall and the majority of my assets are in the current financial system and fiat. Bitcoin is just a very interesting, innovative tool which *could* be massive. If you disagree, that's cool... you may be right. Trying to convince others its shit is like trying to convert someone to support your football team... aint going to happen. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:05:56
Why on earth should it bring out the best in people? It's money, money hardly ever does that. When people perceive they are losing money they get pissed off! Money is essentially your time and effort, at some point you've probably sacrificed time and work and swapped it for money (bitcoin)... So to see it vanish is frustrating.
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:27:33
It may be stupid to you that something can have value and be accepted as money without the blessing of your masters... But the fact of the matter is that it IS. As I type people are doing global online commerce with Bitcoin. The proof as they say, is in the pudding. I've bought lots of things and I've donated money to people. The person I donated to got my money instantly and no organisation got a cut as they would if I'd used a charity. The history of alternative notes in the us is irrelevant. 
This is a global currency in a digital age... The rules have changed, and your 'authorities' are not mine. 
People far smarter than you or I think it's a good idea with potential. So your opinions don't really matter to me.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:32:16
Oh I guess it wouldn't matter, just think there are probably better ways for you to be spending your time. I simply disagree that you can't just create your own money... Because it's been done. The fact that the value of bitcoin is volatile is irrelevant, it is money and is being used as money as we speak. For 3 years I have bought items with bitcoin...it is money. Historically people have used all kinds of things for money, shells, stones, salt... This is just an extension of that. 
The future of money is digital... Will bitcoin be part of it, or just a beta? Who knows. 
I don't need to Google problems with bitcoin, I'm aware of the problems... And guys far more intelligent than your or I are working on them. Maybe you should Google advantages of bitcoin!? Micropayments, near instantaneous transfer of value for next to nothing, increased privacy, enabling the unbanked access to a way of storing value. Bitcoin holds promise... It's very early days however, so I get your scepticism... Some days I feel the same. But so what?! Just chill and don't care about it mate... If you have no stake in it what does it matter that I do? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:31:40
Can't be bothered to reply to most of this as again you just seem to have a narrow (the world is just the US) view.
If you want an alternative coin which is superior to Bitcoin which you hope cryto users will all just adopt and those who've invested in mining hardware and venture capital will just switch to... What features would you like to see in it that Bitcoin can't do?
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:13:55
So you just want bitcoin to stay the same indefinitely? I'll sell today myself if it's just going to stay the same.
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:19:05
I find the tech savvy are the most anti-bitcoin... Probably because they missed the big runups in 2011/13 etc. If it fails they don't feel do bad about it, so they have a vested interest in it failing.
@_date: 2015-08-20 20:21:39

And you're correct, others can make more digital currencies, and there are hundreds... However Bitcoin has first mover advantage and is by far the most popular. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:34:00
But apparently don't understand that these problems can be addressed and fixed? Its just game over?
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:17:15
Yes. From the outside, where people care not about what a 1MB block means it looks really shit. Loads of news here and in the media about unconfirmed transactions. It looks like Bitcoin is struggling. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:59:27
Why is bitcoin such a stupid idea? I can send money to a guy I don't know or trust pretty much instantaneously for a negligible fee. The unbanked in poor countries can be banked. Micropayments can be made to artists or bloggers. My personal information is not leaked or recorded by some big central entity. I can walk across a boarder with 1m in my head. I can buy weed online. In the future I might even have contracts on the block chain. You realise people like bill gates and Richard Brandon don't think it's a stupid idea don't you? In a way that makes you look stupid to me. 
Bitcoin and the blockchain are interesting and potentially world changing. If you don't think it is... Good for you. It's almost as though you're trying to convince yourself there's nothing here. Just pick a different idea if bitcoin is stupid to you. I think people who waste their time commenting on things they find stupid even more stupid! You're boring me now anyway, you come across as a troll. Night night
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:43:03
It doesn't look like a win from what I'm seeing
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:28:42
So will shops be able to refuse Bitcoin from one of the forks? 
@_date: 2015-08-21 11:38:08


Why do you care how other feel about paper losses or gains? Are you one of those sad people who gain pleasure from others loss?
Relax, take care of your business and let others take care of theirs. I learnt a huge amount about myself during the Bitcoin crashes I rode out. 


The risk of it being banned was the reason I sold during the 2013 bubble... and that fear potentially cost me 1/2 million dollars if I had waited until the November bubble. 
All evidence since has however pointed to the fact that it is not going to be made illegal... because, why should it?!
Worst case, more areas attempt to regulate it like New York. Bitcoin will continue regardless of this. Australia recently gave it the same status as currency! Its an outdated and false argument.


Not at all, considering the insane amount of 'money / value' the blockchain might handle one day I am more than happy for it to evolve slowly and face off as many trials and tribulations that can be thrown at it. The worlds best hackers have probably been trying to break it... and its still there. 
Every attack, trial, developer disagreement eventually makes it stronger. 
There is no rush either!! Do you want Bitcoin to hurry up and go mainstream, or die? You're really confusing. 
And no Version 1 would imply it is ready for the big time... which it is not. 


XT 'could be' Bitcoin...if it gains consensus... that's how this open source project works.
If there are superior coins out there, either their benefits could be assimilated in to Bitcoin or that alt coin simply wont gain the traction it needs. Million of dollars worth of mining hardware and infrastructure is not just going to switch to 'alt coin'... They are not just going to go... fuck it, lets try this other coin. Why? Because there is nothing wrong with Bitcoin that cant be fixed! And its proven itself extensively over the last 7 years. Volatile price does not indicate success or failure. 


Trading whilst timing Bitcoin would be akin to gambling yes. 
I've made and lost a lot of coin playing with this.


OK, well short it then, you'll make some money if you're correct. 
There is absolutely no reason to believe you are correct in your predictions though. Just as I cant be certain in mine. 
Competition? I dont see anything close to comepting with Bitcoin at the moment... if Bitcoin dies I don't think people would bother with another cryto. 
Disappointment? There are a ton of disappointed people here... but even those with no vested interest (you) are still here so interest is still pretty high!
Lack of improvement: This is the only possibly valid point you raise... there is clearly a standoff at the moment with the direction Bitcoin will take. This in itself is a necessary growing pain as many bigger and more important decisions might be needed in the future. 
It is a fascinating time in Bitcoin for sure!!! I love it :)  
Personally if I thought the value of a commodity (say Gold for example) was going to go down (which I do)... I wouldnt hang around the Gold forums mocking the Gold bulls who have 'lost' money or thought it was going to gain value. 
I would invest my time in topics that I had an interest in! 
You're wasting your life my friend!  
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:54:53
Very true, I don't really have the knowledge to know if xt is the best way forward... I just want the best for Bitcoin. Censoring it however makes me support xt!!!

Such as?


Massive generalization there. Two guys in our IT department used to constantly berate me for  buying Bitcoin in 2011... they certainly did not understand what Bitcoin was about technically or philosophically. They just reiterate the misunderstandings in the mainstream press. 
Have you really set up an account just because you dislike Bitcoin?
For the record, I am fully aware its not perfect... but it is very fascinating and I have found it extremely useful. Those who say it will replace FIAT or are complete fanboys give us all a bad name. 
They make it sound like a pump and dump... I guess I was guilty of that too at some point! ha 
If you don't like it, I don't understand why you expend energy deriding it? Just move on to something that does interest you mate.

90 percent of your savings is completely retarded. You're buying something you know nothing about, at an all time high after months of run up. There are big problems with bitcoin surrounding how it will scale. Zoom out on the charts and see how previous bubbles have gone.
How would you feel if the price crashed back to the previous ath of $1000 or lower? If the answer is sleepless nights... Get out now.
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:27:27


No nerve touched pal, this is it full of dick heads who make stupid comments, generalize and stereotype those who they reply to and feel superior to for some reason. 
Well I don't feel morally compromised by making a ton of money in 2013. I doubt it was from many grandmothers if I'm honest.
If people lost money, they probably learnt valuable lessons... I have learned a load from Bitcoin about economics, finance, encryption, markets etc. etc.
You sound like an early adopter who doesn't really see Bitcoin being successful... if you don't see it as having a future and you're not in it for profits, what the fuck are you doing with your life spending time here telling people you were an early adopter of something that is doomed to fail? That's ridiculous, you should be hiding the fact that you invested time and effort in to a failed experiment. 
If in 10 years Bitcoin is a major player of internet finance, will I still not be considered by yourself as an early adopter?
I'm 50/50 on where Bitcoin is going, but I have enjoyed the ups and downs a long the way... the only thing I dislike is the tools who post here sometimes. 
So if we're all bag holders, have you sold all your coins? You should do, then donate the proceeds to charity to appease your conscience . 
I personally have no problem sleeping at night when my stocks go up in value... its how the world works. Its a competitive place, there are winners and losers.  If not it would be a fucking boring World.

I think it's just a natural response to the pro bitcoin evangelists who make Bitcoin seem like some sort of religion. That and some people are only aware of the negative aspect of bitcoin... thefts, drug dealing and money laundering for example. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:26:26
How can you decree that it's a payment system? Surely it 'is' what it is used for? ... At the moment a highly speculative commodity.
I don't want to use purse.io. I get one click ordering on Amazon, very quick payments with PayPal, insured payments with credit card, near instant bank transfers with my bank. Why the fuck would I care about using purse.io.
I don't want to spend bitcoin, most bitcoin holders don't.
Will it evolve into a useful currency? Maybe... But not today. Morons won't agree on a scaling issue which might actually kill the whole project.

@_date: 2015-03-19 13:58:32
I bought a lot in 2013 and made a load of money... I'm not sure why that boggles your mind. Secondly, no idea what makes you think that I think I'm an early adopter. Thirdly, 'early adoption' status is relative... If you were a geek with a graphics card in 2009 mining bitcoin... Good on you mate. If bitcoin realises it's potential anyone who owns any now IS an early adopter. None of my friends or family use or have owned bitcoin... so I am an early adopter. I don't expect to get rich, it's just a gamble and a bit of fun to me. If it continues to tank, I'm not that bothered. And to reiterate my point, they do have value because of their expected future value... That's just economics. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:40:37
Well that's the point... one point can fail and you're still cool. Same reason people use two factor authentification for their online banking etc. It's just safer... Not less safe. By all means continue to use a single point of failure if you feel better.

Dont blame you mate, have a good night. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:27:26
That is a little bit of a simplistic view of it if I'm honest. The current financial system has been good to me and it works 'fairly' well. If the financial system was run on Bitcoin I think we would be worse off... how would you stimulate an economy in recession, or slow it down if its going too fast. We came off a Gold standard because it could lead to deflation (bad for an economy)... also so we could afford to fight some World wars. We would have lost otherwise!!! Granted, its open to abuse by inflating our savings away... but that hasn't been too bad in the West to date.

@_date: 2017-05-13 04:55:48
Bit harsh saying I'm not relevant. I would wager 95% of people who own bitcoin don't spend it. It's a huge hassle to spend it! Far easier and safer to buy stuff on my credit card.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:39:23
Most people are in as they expect the price to rise significant so they can sell at a profit. If my bitcoin was worth 1mil I would sell it for my local currency. I don't really care if Bitcoin exists in 20 years, I just want to make money. As do most people. Obviously there is a small contingent of anarcho capitalists here who want to see fiat burn or whatever... Most people don't want that though.

That's why I said some items. Technology is not the entire economy. Countries have experienced extended periods of deflation and I don't know of an example where the economy benefited.

What app is that from?
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:25:07
I'm sure it's got some use cases, for people in shitty countries or who need to send cash across borders. Or if you fancy something on the dark web. 
For my day to day purchases, it's just not worth the hassle.
Purse.io looks vaguely interesting... Seems convoluted by buying other people's gift cards though.
As I've told you, I'm just in it for the capital gain... As are the vast majority of people. 
I don't really care what the white paper says... That was one guys vision. Doesn't mean that's how it will be used! The guy who invented the internet could not have foreseen what it evolved into. 
Of course it can have value as a commodity without being a method of payment. It can also happy be a hybrid of the two.
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:14:08
Would you like to be worth 1 millionth of the world's dollars? You would be fucking loaded. If bitcoin takes off owning 1 millionth of the currency will make you unique. If bitcoin fails owning 1 millionth (at present prices) won't ruin you either. It's a gamble and I like the odds.

Local bitcoins is a pain in the ass in the UK at least. You need to register with your passport. 
I have one click ordering with Amazon
...I fail to see the benefit of swapping bitcoin on some app for probably a gift card, and then replacing that bitcoin by using local bitcoin. 
If I had a shop I don't think I'd accept bitcoin... If I had sold say, a TV yesterday, yet didn't manage to convert to £ until today, I would now have less currency than the TV cost me!!
Sorry, I just think bitcoin is a crap currency.
But I do like it as a commodity.
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:07:42
Pretty simple, there's limited supply. If more people start using bitcoin there is more demand. More people chasing the same number of coins, price goes up. Don't mean to be condescending, but it's as simple as that. The value of anything is pretty arbitrary. Sounds like you can see why it is useful, now realise that the majority of people haven't realised that yet... That's a lot of potential future demand. 21 million coins isn't really many in a global context. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:33:17

Well it's a school of hard knocks, best way to learn. I'm happy for them, they are gaining a huge amount of knowledge about bitcoin and themselves. I got burned freaking out back in the single digits listening to all kinds of idiots who 'knew' what was and wasn't a good price. 
Fuck it, experiencing some turbulence is almost a right of passage in this game.
Nobody knows what the fuck is happening.... Just let people do what they want.
 Could still see 2k in the coming months, could also see 1k. Toss of a coin, I'm happy with either.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Nobody knows which direction this thing is going, up, down, loop the loop...a year from now you could be saying. "No offence but why didn't you remortgage your house at 700" or "no offence, why didn't you sell everything at the peak". I imagine he was feeling pretty bad after the price tanked from the peak he bought at and didn't feel like investing more at 250
@_date: 2015-03-19 07:40:25
Well they have that value because of their future expected value. There's very little I buy with bitcoin at the moment, but in 5 years I can see it being useful... Traveling abroad for example and not needing to get foreign money, that would be cool. Or micro payments for artists whose music I like. To me it's better to buy now than when it gets more expensive. Of course it could crash and burn, I guess you feel that way as you think it's over priced. Time will tell!

I don't think fundamentals have much to do with bitcoin. It's not a stock. Just bitcoin doing what's its done numerous times before... Bubble up massively, then crash. It will happen this time, and maybe a few more times (with luck). I can't be bothered trying to time the peaks and troughs, so I'll just hodl. Worked well so far. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:28:53

Exactly, none of us know how Bitcoin will end up, which is why its so much fun. 
I only used the internet and PCs as an analogy as I'm not sure what else to compare Bitcoin too. I guess I could have picked any tech related field which has exploded despite having naysayers who were intelligent and well informed when they made their predictions of its demise. 
 My personal feeling is Bitcoin has a 50 percent chance of succeeding. Everyone on here will have different opinions, I wasn't being disingenuous in comparing it to the Internet as in I wasnt implying that it will succeed like the internet, just that a lot of people never saw the internet becoming what it did. A lot of people don't appreciate the cool stuff that can be done with Bitcoin that current financial systems cannot do.

You can't say "most of us" ... If that's your target, good luck. Everyone however is different, any their targets continually change.
I bet lots of people who bought in at $8 said "if it hits 1000 I'm out"... Yet they're still here.
 If it hits 4000, it's well on its way to the moon and you could be dropping out early. I bet you struggle to sell any then.
It's all contingent on how the block scaling debate turns out.

I lost my mobile last year with a Bitcoin wallet on it and Authy (2FA) to many accounts. 
I lost neither my Bitcoins nor access to any of my accounts. You are only going to if you are stupid or incompetent.
Its still early days, but safe multisig wallets will be the ONLY way sensible people use Bitcoin in the future. 
My logic in no way implies 10 password multisig would be the safest way to store Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 06:58:07

I don't think the general public will switch to Bitcoin. That doesn't mean it won't still be hugely successful in the future being utilized by many people. The biggest use cases would be micropayments ... Being able to tip artists and bloggers easily is a game changer. Other massive markets would be migrants sending money home without huge fees, people using it as a hedge against their own currencies inflating away and use in countries who don't have our banking facilities. But as you imply, everyone here has a different opinion... Who knows what will happen.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:17:07
That wallet was not a multi sig wallet so it's an argument for multisig if anything. And sure, if the person who found my phone managed to decrypt my phone and figure out I actual own bitcoin, break into my house, find my safe and crack it to find the hand written seed ... Sure I would be compromised. I'd much prefer an easy to use a multisig wallet though.
Send bitcoin from my PC, verify with my phone or smart watch.... Simple and safe.

And that's what makes this whole ride interesting. If it becomes easier to buy Bitcoin, easier and safer to store Bitcoin and more people accept and pay for services with Bitcoin I dont see why it wont be more use. I have donated to a couple of sites with Bitcoin and it was a great experience... I dont have to share my details with them and it was 'copy/paste/send' easy. 
In those cases, I just bought more Bitcoin to replace what I had just spent. Sure, we might just be boom and bust for years and never reach stability... or something crazy might happen like entire shitty countries adopt Bitcoin. Its a gamble (as it has always been)... NOBODY knows what will happen. I have had a killer time over the last 2 years so even if it does go to zero I dont feel like I've lost or wasted anything. You may be correct being bearish... but the downside to the gamble is far outweighed by the potential upside if you ask me. Its a tired argument, but there are people who said the Internet or even PCs themselves would never take off. They look silly in retrospect. 
If people dont use it for commerce, the underworld economy and money laundering are staggeringly huge markets for which Bitcoin is well suited.

I was using mycelium so kept my master seed separate. Same with Authy... it backs up to an online account. Both my phone and each app was pin protected. Got a new phone, restored wallet from seed... Transfer to new wallet to just be safe and change password on authy. Sounds complicated, but pretty easy. As a backup I remote wiped my old phone using device manager or lookout or something like that

I was using 2FA as a comparison as its fairly similar. To authorize a multisig transfer I would use 2 devices... say my laptop and a secondary device to sign the transaction.
 So exactly the same as 2FA... BOTH devices would need to be compromised. 
It is much safer. 
So what is your argument, people shouldn't use multisig? 
I don't see how multisig makes you twice as vulnerable at all.

It's debatable, I would use veracrypt and copy them to at least 2 sticks. If it's in a sufficiently encrypted container you can even keep a copy in the cloud. Or use an old PC for cold storage. Paper just seems a bit antiquated to me. My printer in networked too so I don't trust it!!

If I had 10 m (or whatever it was) in bitcoin I'd cash 2m and hold the rest to liquidate over the next year or so dependent on bitcoin movements. Even that might be too high to cash out... I'd be paranoid the place I sold them would tip off one of the hundreds of pissed off people. Many of who are going to be 'pretty serious' individuals.

Oh I've used it... But it's just a pain in the ass to replace it with more Bitcoin. I've also had bad experiences...I paid for my VPN with bitcoin. 3 months later they cancelled my service and I had no proof I had paid for it (or the proof I did have wasn't adequate). Other than that, you simply can't spend it at that many places. The price changes so rapidly I don't know how much something is fucking costing me either!

Well its been pretty well documented... and to be honest just common sense tells me deflation is bad. If the car I want is cheaper in a few months I will hold off from buying it. The go to response for you will be...but what about electronic gadgets! I guess short life-span 'lowish' cost items are immune to this to an extent. We HAVE to have the latest phone now... a car or house can wait. 
I can see it with my own use of Bitcoin... I hate spending Bitcoin as my expectation is that they will be worth more in the future. An economy run on a deflationary currency would not grow very fast at all... at best you would stagnate, or enter a deflationary spiral .  
Of course Economists could have 'brain washed me' on this... but can you point to an economy which works well in a deflationary environment?
Slight inflation gives a little grease to the wheels to keep us growing and moving. There is an incentive to buy that car now!
I said we could never have won the World Wars whilst stuck on the gold standard... you need some flexibility in a currency system.  I don't agree with the recent wars no. 
And do you think Bitcoin is an answer to equality? If it does take off the inequality will be just as bad as it is in the fiat world... most people here are only in Bitcoin to make money!


Really? No regulation? It was a lack of regulatory oversight  which caused the 2008 crash. Without regulation you get MtGox. Give me an example of a successful economy which has no regulations ?
And Bitcoin is manipulated to fuck!!

The majority of thieves would have no idea what Bitcoin is let alone that a random string of words was a seed to a Mycelium wallett which has a fraction of my Bitcoin holdings on. 
I also have a digital backup in a veracrypt container stored in the cloud. 
If they can break that shit they are welcome to the coins. 
I give out my credit card details online all the time and have been ripped off before with fraudulent transactions on my account. 
The thieves would have far less trouble stealing my check book and something with a copy of my signature and ripping me off that way. Most of my Bitcoin are in  cold storage (backed up and encrypted before you pipe up again). I also have some in a brain wallet,. 
I'm not really sure what your point is here if I'm honest? You sound like you are trolling now!

Stocks are generally zero sum games too, one side of the trade wins, the other loses. Sure the companies who issue the stock originally add value (pay dividends, or not in the case of tracker funds)... but so do the Bitcoin companies that exist and are being invested in my venture capitalists.

Nope, I have no agenda in regards to which way bitcoin evolves. I just want to be able to answer the criticism that the protocol can only handle 7 transactions per second. I don't know the best way to go about that. It's probably best to take our time though considering how much is at stake. I'm sure in time the correct path will become obvious. One slip up could ruin bitcoin! So I defer to the experts. Might see if softfork is still available :)

That's not going to happen in our lifetime. Even if Bitcoin did grow to such an extent that banks collapsed and governments lost all control over money... it would not stop wars. 
Inequality and the gap between rich and poor would be even wider than it is today! A few thousand people would be immensely wealthy. They would want to keep that power (I know I would)... and groups would want to take that power. Therefore, wars would happen.

Having a military, Wars and fighting are human nature... they have happened throughout history regardless of the medium of exchange in place at the time. Bitcoin could hypothetically be used to fund war. 
A quick google told me that in the US federal spending on the military is 57%. That is a ridiculous amount... but... the US is one of the most successful countries in history because of it. Without military expenditure you literally wouldn't exist as a country. 
Also, without wars you would enable dictators and rogue nations to do as they please... which includes attacking you.

Its completely relative!!! Example... last year I had nearly 400, and I didn't think that was many. Today I have far fewer as I cashed out in April. After the crash I even sold 30 at $30 or so, because they were worthless to me. With all the hacking, the crap exchanges and the oncoming Government regulation I preferred $'s... I dont regret it as you can only act on the knowledge you have at the time. 
7 out of 11 million in a global context is quite significant if Bitcoin takes off as a currency instead of a speculative punt.... but it could also be nothing if Bitcoin goes to zero.

Utter nonsense. I love Bitcoin, but to proclaim that an institutions which holds the bulk of my wealth are obsolete is silly. Bitcoin at the moment can handle 7 tx per second or something.

So I have some XRP... doesn't make it bad. I also have fiat!
My company use Ripple to move funds... and for that it is better than Bitcoin. I'm not trying to pump xrp up, as its not meant to be hoarded and pumped as Bitcoin is. It offers advantages over Bitcoin, nothing wrong with hedging your bets either. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:20:36
It was clearly a bubble, most people were expecting to burst. Wealth preservation is a pretty normal reaction. I think Bitcoin took that punch well...the infrastructure has been tested so we know which issues need addressing. It also shook out and burnt a lot of the people who were here only to profit. Lots of news coverage too.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:26:53
I read the article and disagreed with it, as its just a variation of the things I've read about Bitcoin for over a year. I guarantee you I will be losing no shirt.

True, or the owners fail to do it legally. It's interesting that nobody comes out and gives us a full statement of what happened. I think that perhaps the owners don't want the price of bitcoin to take a hit. My thoughts are that banks are actively targeting them.

I don't expect to convert any blinkered Bitcoin fanboys. And I'm just stating facts. I have a larger interest in Bitcoin...if I said some positive points about bitcoin would you say the same?

@_date: 2013-11-08 18:17:06
Those certainly aren't the two things that could cause a crash. Nothing can go parabolic and stay that way... its impossible. It would be nice to think that the recent rise will just level off, but that wont happen. When the top of this bubble is reached people will get board and wish to lock in the gains they have made... the price will drop... people will panic and the price will continue to drop. The price could easily be back to $200 this time next week. There are even less places you can actually spend Bitcoin than there were 6 months ago!!! And who the hell wants to spend Bitcoin at the moment... Would you buy a car today if the the price you paid for that car is 20% greater tomorrow? That is the problem with a deflationary currency when the price is as volatile as it is now. Will this always be a problem to Bitcoin? ...I don't know.

Technology and systems can be built on the blockchain,  an example would be you pay from an app which is linked to a verified bitcoin account or something so the vendor knows you are good for the money. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:35:28
I guess by then people won't want to convert back to fiat. I can't imagine someone would would cash out that much in one go either as it would be self defeating... They would get a better price spreading the sale. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:54:46
I don't think many people are using bitcoin yet. Hoarding yes, but not using. I personally think after this bubble bursts we will have a couple of more bigger bubbles in the future. I'm not sure if it will ever be used by everyone as not everyone needs what if offers. For online purchases I prefer PayPal or credit card... Both offer assurance against fraud and I know what I'm paying.

It's falling on deaf ears of closed minded people mate. That ripple scam site is a scam...they should at least update it to say ripple is open source. There's room for more than one solution in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:15:59
What coins are you referring to? Bitcoin? XRP? 
Much like Bitcoin its still in its infancy, if you don't like it cool. If you want to only trust yourself that's cool. 
My company uses Ripple, and it saves us money.

Its just a wealthy trader trying to cause a panic sale... he then buys all back for cheaper making a profit from the panic sellers. These guys are also the ones who push us through walls... they make money in both bullish and bearish markets. We need them, but they will rinse you of money or Bitcoin if you are not careful. Only proven long term strategy to not be affected is to buy BTC and hold. You won't outsmart them... they have experience, capital, powerful friends, trading bots and tools , beyond most peoples means.  As Bitcoin grows the class and power of these guys grows.

Well that service is not in my country... also, why would I want to pay a 3rd party service for something I can just buy with a credit card or PayPal. 
My credit card even protects me from fraud. 
Bitcoin has its uses... it was made for money laundering, drug trades and times when you want to be anonymous. I don's see the advantage for every day commerce though.

Good effort, I bought a load when they were 12$...took a lot of profit in April. I just have a few now and it's still a bit stressful. I would be nervous if I had a load of coins now! 
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:44:26
I use Armory, solid program. Then do a backup of your wallet, put it in a truecrypt container and stick it on a couple of USB devices. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:28:42
Well lets not fall out about it, I have read conflicting reports and China first banned the nation's banks from handling any transactions involving  virtual currency...then third party processors. To me it looks like they are slowly strangling Bitcoin trade. I believe it will get worse, you believe different. We shall see. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:54:17
Thats the deadline for the Chinese to get their money off the exchange. Apparently they are already using a different exchange... but that could easily be closed. I have no idea where we are going.

@_date: 2013-12-15 15:05:50
Bitstamp is the only way to go... localbitcoins and bitbargain are too expensive if you are dropping that much money in. You will need to verify your account with a copy of your passport... then just do a SEPA transfer from your bank account to them. I've done it loads of times... Natwest charges 10 quid for 1-2 day transfer or 30 for same day. You will get more BTC for your money. Be aware that your Mums investment could lose money easily. This is not for the feint of heart... and you don't want to feel guilty. 
Storage, look at Armory client. And remember to BACK UP your wallet to a USB drive or multiple other places after encrypting it. Other wallets are available where you dont have to donwload the blockchain.. but Armory has the best feeatures... such as printing a physical copy of your wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:12:20
Well that is one of bitcoins problems... What's stopping insiders at exchanges seeing upcoming trades and profiting from that knowledge. Regulations are there for a reason... The financial crisis was due to poor regulations. The more money at stake the worse it will be... So many clueless fish in bitcoin, it is an absolute gift for professional traders too.

The housing bubble popped...but people still buy houses. All markets surge and recede otherwise the price would be linear. 1000 plus was a bubble, we won't get back there for a long time...but there will be another bubble bigger than this recent one.

So you think a vertical line can continue to infinity? Or there will be a gentle tapering off and leveling... where all the speculators (the majority of Bitcoin holders) decide they want to actually spend Bitcoins instead of locking in their profits? There will be a major correction, and more bubbles. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:00:25
People have been thinking like that the whole way up. Just because you have sold you are looking for others to validate your position.

I think it's an apt comparison. In the UK we have cameras fucking everywhere. So watching me in my home = bad, but monitoring all my communications, present location, purchases, private files, appointments, friends etc. etc is ok? It's exactly the same.

That's pretty typical mania thought.  It would be nice if this were an S curve... But at some point (could be 2000 plus) there could be a big correction. That's always been the way with Bitcoin. In a way is needed, weeds out speculators and boosts awareness. Could be a few more boom and busts... But one day it will stay up! Need mass acceptance online though... The economy isn't there. Never bet against Bitcoin though

@_date: 2013-10-08 18:34:39
Who knows what the implications are, this is uncharted territory. I imagine it will drive criminals and terrorists further underground and therefore harder to catch. I very much doubt they ever used facebook and email to plan attacks anyway so this only about spying on regular citizens. 
Some bad shit could happen also, with that much power what is to stop say a political leader being blackmailed by an email proving that he is cheating? The Government could use this capability to stay in power, so good bye democracy (If there is such a thing).
I don't think it has made this country a better place at all. 
I think there will also be an arms race with average Joe's such as myself making greater use of encryption, VPNs etc. to try and stop big brother from watching my activity online which will again make the spooks jobs harder as they will be spending resources just to find out that I am innocent.

Well few people understand it at the moment which is pretty typical during the innovation stage of any technology. The price is the result of everyone trying to value something that we have never seen before! If a frictionless, fast, decentralised virtually free to transfer currency and payment protocol is of no value to you then don't buy any. Will it stabilise in the long term? Nobody knows. This could either be the Internet monetizing itself (massive game changer) or a rather interesting but failed experiment... Time will tell. I personally want to be part of the experiment. I sent money to Europe yesterday ... It cost me £30 and took a day. That's a pretty inefficient transfer of value from my perspective.

Virtual machine or sandbox and check it out :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:23:38
Nobody knows, the opinion in here will be extremely biased also. This looks like a giant Bubble like last April... but even if you bought at the peak in April (and held) you would be doing well today. What I'm saying is... we could be half way in to a bubble, or at the top. Take your pick. Assess what you think the value of Bitcoin is as a technology. If its worth $422 go for it. This is either going to thousands or zero. People were asking your exact question when it was $10, $100 and $200... they could be asking the same at $1000.  
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:03:40
Of course currency loses value... But not to the extent that Bitcoin can. Tomorrow bitcoin could be worth 50 percent less.

@_date: 2013-12-05 07:57:44
*  Let's ignore the fact that they'll probably continue to buy more BTC 
The early guys probably have thousands of Bitcoins so will not be buying more.
Your prediction could only come true if people actually spend Bitcoin, and there is a functional economy behind it. 
I paid for my VPN last week... if ever there were a case to pay for something with Bitcoin, that was it. Except I chose to pay with Paypal... why? Because I dont want to lose my Bitcoin.
...and there lies the problem. 
If everyone here is like yourself salivating about one day being rich, Bitcoin will fail 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:00:56
There's very little to buy in the UK with bitcoin... Also a pain to get hold of it. Going to wait until this bubble bursts... Sell for cash then rebuy bitcoin. Stupid to buy anything with bitcoin tomorrow it means I overpaid by 25‰
@_date: 2013-04-19 08:22:34
You can't say it would be stupid, there may be valid reasons for them to sell. More big name exchanges going offline...more banks clamping down. I've adjusted my position as I see risk levels increasing.  I sold most of mine at 220 then bought back in at 90  and 60. I took some profits too, now I'm just playing with house money. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:33:35
Ahhh, I'm a pessimist... actually Bitcoin has reveiled I'm completely bi-polar! I can switch from being a bear to a bull in a matter of seconds!! 'm bearish as this totally looks like your typical burst with a few dead cat bounces flailing around... but also optimistic after the Senate things etc. Sold earlier, then felt bad... then got back in (made 0.5 BTC) then felt bad. No idea whats going to happen. I would think people will be sceptical for any significant rise for a while.

It's still a baby, given time mixing your coins will be standard practice and make it impossible to trace. They may not be worried as we're stupid enough to turn bitcoin in to an eternal boom and bust cycle until everyone loses confidence. People are greedy and just hold bitcoin, the price skyrockets then crashes. We need vendors to get on board... But seriously I don't know if I would accept Bitcoin. If I sold an item for 1000 bitcoins earlier, I would now have far less than the item even cost me! Bitcoin is years away from mainstream... If ever. Mind you, the underground drug scene will continue!

I was drunk when I wrote that... I was trying to say that we need something easy to understand. I find uBTC MBtc etc confusing. The words don't roll of the tongue either... Like pence or cents (one syllable not three) . A bit is the same as a satoshi. 1 Bit = 100,000,000 satoshi. That's easy and harder to make mistakes when paying people. It's not a random unit,  and will help Bitcoin go mainstream.

I don't think the news is clear yet, are Chinese banned from putting money on to the exchange... or just from doing that through 3rd party companies? It may be that funds have to go only through the banks which makes sense. But to answer your question... I'm holding, the price can rapidly escalate and at the end of the day I want to be holding Bitcoin. I only seem to lose money if I sell as I end up panic buying back! This time next year none of this will matter. If any Government are going to be tough on Bitcoin, it is the Chinese!

Ok, bad choice of wording by me...but third-party payment service providers must stop offering clearing services to online Bitcoin exchanges by 31 Jan. I haven't read how people are getting funds on to the other exchange they are all moving too...again "loophole" was perhaps a bad choice of language. So far China have told their main financial institutions to avoid Bitcoin, next were 3rd party institutions...It's obvious the Chinese stance against Bitcoin is growing and they could quite easily clamp down on however the Chinese people are now trading. It's impossible to know how things will play out...I'm betting it will get tougher rather than better.

Like Bitcoin:
Ripple is an open source, distributed peer-to-peer payment network
Ripple transactions are irreversible, sent over the Internet, and 
counterfeit proof
Ripple uses the same underlying cryptography as Bitcoin
Ripple has multi-signature support
Ripple has low to no transaction fees
Ripple servers can be run by anyone
Unlike Bitcoin:
Ripple can send any currency
Ripple can automatically exchange currencies
Ripple transactions are fully confirmed in seconds
Ripple allows nicknames and gravatar icons for accounts
Ripple's reference client is a Firefox and Chrome add on
Ripple has no block chain download, clients are ready in seconds
Ripple has no mining or direct monetary reward for running a server
Ripple has no currency risk as people can hold whatever fiat they want

I wouldn't buy anything with Bitcoin at the moment. If I bought something today in Bitcoin by tomorrow that thing would have cost me more than if I had used $'s.

I think a lot of them wont know what the fuck Bitcoin is about... once they understand its 'potential', they will want to nip it in the bud. As seen in the UK banks fucking hate Bitcoin, and they have a lot of power. 
The Government has just spent billions bailing them out, they are not going to want a free market competitor. 
Not to mention, Bitcoins potential use for funding terror, pedophiles, tax evasion, money laundering, hiring hitmen, buying guns and blackmailing Mitt Romney. 
The biggest issue is it takes power from them... nobody likes to lose power. 
They have nothing to gain from Bitcoin, my gut feeling is they will ban businesses from accepting virtual currencies. Or make buying Bitcoin for US citizens a royal pain in the ass... like you have to register how many you have, provide your passport when buying etc.
The rest of the world may be OK... who knows. 
The recent rise of Silk Road 2 is also something they can hit with regulating Bitcoin. They are certainly not going to sit by and do nothing.

Quantum computers capable of breaking Bitcoin could also break your online bank account. It's also a long long way off.
It will be volatile until it's thousands per coin so it becomes too expensive for traders to manipulate it as much. 
It's open source so a lot of great minds have been looking at the code. 
It's a gamble for sure,  but for me it's a small down side for huge upside. When you actually buy things with Bitcoin you realise how cool it is. 
Taxes?

I didn't sell during the flash crash tool... I sold at 620. Still got a position it's just ropey as fuck at the moment. I made Tens of thousands last April so I really couldn't give a fuck about a few dollars... Brah 
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:51:21
It will remain crazy until it is too expensive for rich folk / entities to have such an effect. You only lose money if you panic sell! I'm in Bitcoin for the long the long term so consider Bitcoin money... if I dont sell Bitcoin I dont lose my money. If you only consider Bitcoin as a way of making $ you can lose $'s ((if you sell for less than you bought). I am optimistic for the future of Bitcoin so staying away is not an option. I can lose both $'s and Bitcoin if I have to buy in at a higher price. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:25:15
People have differing numbers of Bitcoins, risk exposure, risk tolerance etc. there is no magical figure when they cash out (if ever). It will be staggered... I sold a load at the April peak. You have to have balls of steel to have kept hold of all of your Bitcoins by this stage.

@_date: 2013-11-09 12:22:44
Not if the guy buying the Bitcoin wants to make more USD too! Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme but it sure as fuck is acting like one. When Mums and friends are buying Bitcoin because you have *made* money...  (though you have made ZERO unless you sell) then we are heading for a massive collapse. Its unsustainable!!! 
It happened last April too... My Mum, Sister and best friend wanted me to buy Bitcoins at $200+ ... it then tanked to $50. Luckily I didn't. This also makes the currency crap as a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:16:11

No I read speculation about why Bitcoin is about to fail...but it won't. Sure people aren't spending Bitcoin much...so? We believe in the coming years many merchants will accept Bitcoin because it's cheaper and easier to do so. I believe that's coming... by your reasoning I should sell now and buy back in when retailers accept it. What if it's more expensive then? That's why I hold Bitcoin. If you don't agree that's cool...continue to use PayPal with their fees and ability to freeze your account. Each to their own buddy.

Yea, I'm sorry...never a good idea to post opinions in this echo chamber for something which may have some benefits over Bitcoin. Bitcoin it's definitely going to replace the dollar...people definitely don't hold it just as a speculative investment, the slow to confirm problem is no problem, governments can't do anything to stop vendors or exchanges, nothing better will ever be invented so let's accuse everyone who even mentions a positive experience of a competitor of being a shill. P.S. I love PayPal...The fact they cover you if you get ripped off it's awesome. (I'm a PayPal shill too).

Don't delude yourself...the sr is a major player for the Bitcoin economy, and will continue to be unless It receives further and greater attacks as we saw earlier this week. Check out the volume the popular sellers are doing...it's ridiculous. The Bitcoin economy not on the dark net is still tiny and Bitcoin is mostly hoarded as a speculative investment. With the price rising on rumors and manipulation and falling when traders cash in. Other drug vendors probably won't succeed until the sr goes offline for the same reason mtgox is still a single source of failure...it has the most number of buyers and sellers. there's no guarantee legitimate Bitcoin will overtake illegitimate use...here in the UK banks are actively closing accounts of bitcoin companies and stopping people sending money to exchanges. I think this will generally be a spreading trend in the developed world. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:37:27

So you just want to read positive items about Bitcoin? Well I have to tell you, most people who hold Bitcoin have a financial incentive for it to succeed too. 
Maybe these commentators you speak of don't want it to succeed as they have no use for it? Maybe Bitcoins ultimate goal of a unified tax free payment method threatens the world in which most of their wealth is based? Maybe some of the crazier people on here who want Bitcoin as a one World Currency and it will be worth $10000 / BTC need to be told it won't happen with Bitcoin.
You have a point that people shouldn't stereotype Bitcoin users in to groups such as libertarians etc. We are all different. 
Myself? I use Bitcoin to pay for my VPN as it is the best tool for that job. I currently hold Bitcoin too for future payments. I don't think it has a massive future though. I see deflation as a big problem... I used to hold hundreds of coins but sold a load during the Bubble as I guess I preferred taking a profit in my native currency. I find the concept of Bitcoin interesting, but I also like having fiat to spend everywhere.  
Everyone is different, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:50:55
Not likely? It is literally perfect after only a few years? At the least its possible. Not all of the alts are clones of Bitcoins source code.
Also, In March 2013 there was a hard fork following the v0.8 release. There was a bug in the software which literally created two blockchains!! It could have destroyed Bitcoin...luckily the day was saved. We may not be so lucky next time. 
I'm not sure what you mean by your second part. Most users now don't bother downloading the blockchain so that part is invalid. If a superior coin came on to the market, which could do those things I mentioned it would start off slow, gain market share and eventually Bitcoin users would jump ship to it and it would explode. All of the Bitcoin infrastructure which is being built can easily be switched to accept a new digital currency. It is very arrogant and closed minded to believe Bitcoin is unbeatable as history has shown with basically everything in the world of technology.

I appreciate none of the current alts are as popular as Bitcoin, but it is far from certain Bitcoin will be the winner here. Always wise to hedge your bets and look out for a serious competitor. I only hold Bitcoin and Ripple at the moment, but I'd buy something new if it has promise. Bitcoin could be MySpace, or a flaw could be found in the protocol.

@_date: 2013-04-16 07:17:40
It was not that long ago that Bitcoin was $12, $50 is not that low. Sure there has been lots of media attention so lots more people are aware of it. They are also aware that there was a big crash. 
I think it would be pretty easy for an organization or entity to hinder Bitcoin using DDOS etc.. I guess its possible an organization bought a load of Bitcoins just to dump after the bubble popped to drive it down further... who knows. 
This could just be the Winklevei twins dumping their ridiculously large position.

Fair enough... I'm not sure its wise to keep a substantial amount of BTC in any online wallet. Just because you had an erroneous email does'n't mean they are untrustworthy though. Of all the online wallets, I think I would trust them the most as you can download the private keys. Lots of people have used them for a long time and I don't see many complaints. Ben is a member on Reddit so perhaps direct message him. I wouldn't be too concerned though. It is after all a free service too, with an excellent app.

It sounds crazy but they could go to $10s of thousands for a whole coin. That sounds ridiculous... But so did the internet and everyone having smart phones not that long ago. As I said, phase two of Bitcoin will be when people are buying Bits not Bitcoins. Buying 1000000 bits sounds much better value.
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:06:02
If this were the case you would see a massive spike in BTC price as people withdraw through Bitcoin instead. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:56:09
That's one risky portfolio! 
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:38:14
Well I bought low, medium and high! It's a crap feeling coming back down. The very nature of Bitcoin means there will most definitely be more bubbles...I would bet we get above your buy price in 2014. I have regrettably taken profit already...the Bitcoin I have now, I have no intention of selling...So the price is irrelevant. If it starts being used widely, your buy in point will be considered cheap.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:03:30
Bitcoin is NOT safe you idiot. Its like investing in a startup, ANYTHING can happen... China / American regulation, exploit found, major exchange banned from operating. Put your sisters share in a bond which expires when she's allowed it. I don't care if you lose your share.

Not everyone I have told about Bitcoin are positive. Some associate it with drugs, some see no need for it others believe it's a money making scheme. 
Also, I have no fear that my bank savings will significantly lose value by tomorrow. My bitcoin holdings could significantly lose value by tomorrow. I don't call that a good store of value. It's a speculative investment.

Most Bitcoin exchanges are probably smaller that we know, they are bedroom industries which have grown in only the last couple of years. Its easy to be paranoid that DDos attacks are to blame when we are all hitting refresh at home... overloading the system. The infrastructure is not ready! Its also obvious that it was going to crash so you cant blame any one organisation... the price was damn near verticle which is unsustainable! I'm not an experienced trader and I made money... its pretty easy in this game as so many "investors" pile their money in hoping to double their investment. They don't really know what they are doing and its a gift for those who know how markets work. Could the Government or some other group DDoS to hurt Bitcoin? Sure... and that is something that is very hard to stop. I don't understand why people are still buying!... we are going lower for sure. I think we will see another boom and bust too. Just need a good reason to pump it up like "Greece" or "China are buying" and everyone will be back throwing cash at this thing. Until there is a large underlying economy based on Bitcoin this cycle will continue.

Yea, it is a gut feeling...I just see the US thinking they can police the world. This pisses people off. (I'm not American). 
I can buy anything I want with cash in real life and the government probably don't know what I've bought. Bitcoin is just cash for the internet. 
They can try and regulate it all they like...it's like trying to stop torrents and piracy, can't be done. With the new darkwallet project the spies won't know who owns the Bitcoin. I like the feeling of being anonymous...there is nothing wrong or shady about that. 
I'm no expert on the wars, I think the debt the US is in as a result of them will ruin your country the next decade or less. No way are you ever going to afford to pay 17 trillion (and growing) back. Spending billions on fruitless spying won't help a superpower from falling either.

I'm not telling the guy to swap BTC for xrp...Ripple let's you swap BTC for any currency. Xrp however does offer things which Bitcoin does not...instant transfers for example. The price is rising fast also, so perhaps don't write something off which could dethrone Bitcoin. My company often trades currencies...ripple offers a cheaper and far less risky medium for doing so than Bitcoin.

If they stop US businesses being allowed to accept Bitcoin, why would a load of newbies want in? There will be nothing (in the US) to spend them on. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:36:43
Because a flaw could be found in the Bitcoin protocol. Also, why not? Nothing lasts forever... even facebook is declining. When Bitcoin is not cool, people may jump on to the next improved virtual currency. My problem with Bitcoin is its deflationary nature which promotes hoarding and speculative bubbles (just like we see now). Inflationary currency is no good if you keep printing money (QE)... but if a virtual currency could inflate gradually and confirm more quickly I think that would be better. One guys transaction on here took 40 hours to confirm despite using the correct fee!!! That's crazy. You could fly to the other person and pay them in cash in that time!!!

Visa / Mastercard or banks responding to Bitcoin with their own coin is a possible outcome.

Wtf, you make it sound like btc belongs to Americans. Why would non us countries need a new one...the old one is not broken. Sure the price would be hit...but I'd buy more when it's cheap. Your government may very well make it illegal. You are turning into a massively paranoid, oppressive evil empire. You're too far in debt to ever come back.

Welcome, Just out of curiosity.. what is your honest reason for buying Bitcoin? Do you want to make money? Do you prefer it to your native currency? I'm not judging or going to say you are wrong or anything, I'm just curious. I bought a few hundred months ago but sold most of them as (at the time) I wanted to lock in my profit. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:27:10

It totally depends on your financial position dude. If you are in debt or have no reserves you should sell a couple.

Many here treat Bitcoin as a scammy tool to make $'s. My brother and mother have all invested in Bitcoin without the slightest desire for it to succeed long term. They sold when they made profit. Although I clearly am a gambling man, I'm not going to bet against something I would like to happen. Bitcoin is crazy so could perform a miracle and not dip further and indeed make it to 1000 by Feb...it's unlikely though. A lot of people have just been burnt by losing half their investment. In the short history of Bitcoin when the EXACT same thing happened...it never returned to it's highs in the short term. It will be 6 months or so.

Oh, and it's been worth hanging on to this last year as its gone from a few hundred xrp per dollar to 40. It was in the 20s a few weeks back. I'm going to hold them as they could easily go higher...and it's an awesome project. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:37:19
No, he's talking nonsense. The people selling are probably speculators who don't give a shit about bitcoin and are either cutting their losses, or cashing in... remember these things are a couple of dollars each not long ago. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:43:56

Good for you! It's pretty easy to lose money if you panic sell...like those who sold at 455 today and then panic bought back in higher. Well done for timing it right...It's not easy. I've had variable success in trying to time it so I just hold these days.

You're clearly illiterate, nowhere in my comment did I put words in your mouth. I was mocking this sub reddit as it generally down votes anything not pro Bitcoin. I have never invested any money in Ripple and I'm not trying to convince anyone to use it. I got in early with bitcoin and have already taken a fuckton of profit, and I'm still holding...but I'm still open to alternates as its not always the first mover who wins in technology. Your "joke" was not amusing, and I'm sure you can see why I may have read that as you just being a dick. Saying I think Ripple is brilliant is not being a shill or trying to convince anyone to use it...It's just like my opinion man. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:04:26

They could find a way to limit it just to virtual currencies excluding bartering. They could also make it a nightmare to get hold of bitcoin. In the UK banks refuse funding to any bitcoin related business. That's without any new laws being implemented. Judging by recent Snowden leaks our government can't stand encryption, anonymity, the silk road or not knowing fucking everything. They are not going to let bitcoin slide.

I can maybe see a market for an alternate which is different technically from Bitcoin... I don't think it exists yet though. Litecoin, sexcoin, junkcoin blagh blagh are just noise and not needed. If you have to convert them using an app (i.e some online instant exchange action) that is inefficient, costly in exchange fees, and redundant. Why not just hold Bitcoin? If I was in Europe and only held GBP and went in to a shop I cant imagine going... wait, you dont accept GBP? Wait a minute as I trade my GBP for Euros... when it would have been easer to just walk in to the shop with Euros in advance.  One crypto (maybe two) is enough. The second one will not be litecoin, it is too similar to Bitcoin.

T'is but a scratch! ...clearly crashed, but honey badger has surprised me before. In April it crashed hard...people thought it was going to zero. This time we're just price correcting for the fact that China may want less. Speculators are fleeing to spend their profits on crap presents. But those left know Bitcoin still has value. I think it's around half of the peak...maybe more. I really can't wait to see where we are next Xmas.

I'm an old time who sold out last April, but I miss Bitcoin and find myself checking the news all the time. Recently I decided to get back in, but this US government thing has slowed me. I'm pretty sure regulation is coming in the US which will hammer the price. I'm in the UK where there is no regulation BUT the banks have made it tough by not letting you transfer money to exchanges, which is also bad. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:59:30
Highly unlikely...with the price rising so fast many prefer to just hold. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:48:17
I agree to an extent, they are giving the stuff away. Saying that though...the amount I was given free last year is now worth 3btc :) It's not beyond the realm of possibility for xrp to be worth 1 dollar...it's still very new and it's potential for big companies who trade currencies is massive. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:15:35
We are all kicking ourselves! I used to have hundreds... I read a poor guy sold 5000 for $40! They won't stay at 669. The potential is indeed in the thousands... 10s of thousands... Imagine if a small country adopts it, imagine how much crime money alone can be laundered and hidden in it! Conversely, it could all end in tears. A problem with the code,  a cyclical boom and bust because nobody spends... Who knows. It's a bet for me,  small (but growing)  downside vs huge upside.  Only invest what you are willing to lose 
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:09:49
Nobody is going to pay 14k for a Bitcoin in 2014. Bitcoin has shown numerous times it's value can cut in half in a short period of time. I think we'll beat 1200 though... max will be 4000. Just my opinion though.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:52:04
I guess because the inflation happens over very slowly. With bitcoin it moves like  25% every day 
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:15:58
No, the majority of my assets are not in bitcoin...I do not want anarchy and the loss of my money. You still need banks to pay for bitcoin. I do not want to see my non bitcoin using family and friends in poverty. Although a great film, it's also fantasy and you don't see the aftermath.

If there is one thing Bitcoin has taught me... is that NOBODY can predict what will happen tomorrow let alone next week. So some guy threw a rough number out with no backing... if anything thats an attempt to push the price down by telling people its near its potential. Seriously? Hardly any vendors take Bitcoin... its nowhere near its potential. A few months ago who could have foreseen China piling in and today their Government basically saying... we dont mind you using it. There are plenty of other countries to go Bitcoin crazy. Sure if that's your position sell and see where it goes. I'm holding.

You too need to trust that an exploit or flaw in Bitcoin is not found, that the vast majority of Bitcoin holders are not speculators and wont drop it like a hot rock should it drop below 850, and that a slew of online retailers accept it in the coming 12 months are coming. 
As Ripple grows the number of entities who you can trust will grow also.

Ha ha, I doubt even die hard bitcoin fans will want to trade with a tramp every time they want to buy something. Also why would I want to pay commission? That just adds to the cost of the item, might as well use cash. Anonymous, instant and I know how much it will be worth tomorrow.

It could become a financial black hole...sucking fiat in as its deflationary nature grows the value of your investment. It could become a sort of virus, where people actually get poorer if they don't move to Bitcoin. As Bitcoin increases in value all major world currencies become weaker...the non tech savvy starve and lose their homes. Eventually at a singularity everything breaks and we all end up with zero.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:21:06
Why don't we install cameras and microphones in everyone's homes to record them 24/7. Such little practical cost to their freedoms. Being watched when you don't want to be is not freedom...it's supervision.

Also, try r/bitcoinmarkets

That's cool, each to their own. Xrp isn't really meant for speculators and will probably never be worth much...xrp is mainly to facilitate swapping of regular currencies. We don't know the long term implications of a free market unregulated currency yet. Huge volatility, insider trading and unregulated manipulation might not work out too well. Bitcoin is an experiment after all. The ability to swap any currency for any currency is awesome and I believe will be used by many businesses in the future.
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:08:14
This could also be a 'dead cat bounce'. 
Bitcoin does not need another boom and bust bubble. This rise has been to quick again.

Yea, there are a massively growing number of alt-coins. Bitcoin has first mover advantage though.
When an alt comes out which is purely anonymous, confirms instantly and is even more secure, there could be a rush to that one. It would also be pretty easy for merchants to swap over. (que downvotes)
I have always thought the future of Bitcoin is in the black/grey markets though. Money laundering, tax evasion, blackmail, drugs, porn, terr*** woops! ... and people generally just wanting their privacy back. 
These are massive massive markets though!
One feature of Bitcoin which is hard to replicate by banks is micro-transactions across the web. The fact you can Bitcoitip people is awesome. And that story of the guy who held up a QR code and was sent 25k is brilliant. 
Its only logical that banks, visa, paypal etc. will need to up there game. Which is good for everyone.

@_date: 2013-12-24 07:48:18
Yep thats what I mean... because the market cap is so small its easy to manipulate the price and push us little guys around. Money makes money. Best advice is to buy during a dip and hold. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:21:09
No I'm saying that, as in April the price rose ridiculously just before it crashed down to like 30 percent of its value.... as all over heated bubbles do. If something increases in value by $100 in a day that is unsustainable. There has been some reasonably good news today from some US agencies who may not regulate BTC... which is bullish and is fueling this recent spurt. I don't have any inside information if thats what you mean. Would I buy more Bitcoins at this point. NO, would I sell mine, NO. It is a risky gamble... good luck. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:44:28

just look at this graph and extend out to 2 years, look at April... no offence but there are a lot of people with not much clue of what they are doing pouring money in, and there are a lot of people who want to take that money. This could get to 1000 but it will go down even more brutally. I might be wrong, but history would be on my side.

Because it appreciates in value, I might as well spend fiat which depreciates so the item costs me less. I bought something a month ago with bitcoin and I regret it. Buying bitcoin is a pain in the ass also.

Bubbles which have popped do often approach a new mean (for a short period)... think dead cat bounce or bull-trap which we potentially seeing. Maybe the recent press has generated enough buying support to stop us crashing further... maybe not. A bubble which pops does not necessarily have to go to 10% of its prior value or lower. Look at the property bubble, or stock market bubbles. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:42:42

You trust those figures from an exchange nobody heard of a month ago? 
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:24:12
Well I guess we will find out their capability in the coming months wont we. If you are correct the successors to Silk Road should fall swiftly as their admins are targeted. Obviously they will probably be more careful with how they operate, but the prize for them will be much bigger as the recent press has no doubt made many more potential customers aware of the existence of these market places. 
Personally I don't use these sites, I just like the fact that there is somewhere I can be anonymous online without the Government getting all 1984 on me. I hope they never fully exploit TOR as it is also a very important project for people who genuinely need anonymity such as those in repressed countries who are trying to get news out.

Well one thing is for sure a LOT more people now know about Bitcoin... I heard people at work talking about it. Its still fairly niche though. I dont think we have seen calming volatility, it has never been as volatile as the last month! We need to get up in the $4000 range before volatility decreases as it becomes too expensive to manipulate the market. I hope with the increased awareness of Bitcoin comes increased adoption of retailers accepting it. We also need to make it easier to actually buy Bitcoin! Banks could be utter twats with regard to this and ban people from sending money to exchanges. Some already do this. The future is (as always) uncertain with Bitcoin. But it is anything but dull!
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:16:56
I'm in the UK and we are just as bad, I understand how we have come to this (the fear of terrorists). But now it just reminds me of Nietzsche 's quote

So we have invented artificial intelligence but still use fossil fuels?! Crazy. I think money being digital is inevitable...You could just as easily swipe a card or use a mobile app to pay though. A logical response from our banks to Bitcoin would be to make spending FIAT much more fluidly and easy with QR codes etc. Or MasterCard / visa come out with a coin of their own.

1) Speculation: some believe they can make a lot of money, some believe Bitcoin will be revolutionary
2) History would imply it is a bubble... are we 25% in or 95% in, impossible to say
3) If you have made $800 and you prefer USD, then go for it. You may miss Bitcoin and regret selling if you do though. I sold a few hundred in April... and yet I am back!
4) Concern that it will take a dive during the senate hearing... though Bitcoin is the most illogical thing I have ever  seen, it could fucking shoot up regardless. Honey Badger don't give a shit!

That means it should be 600 tomorrow, and like 2000 next week? 
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:35:22
That doesn't really show how much is being spent... With SR 1 down I would wager less bitcoin is being spent. I pay for my VPN with btc... Everything else online I prefer PayPal or Visa as I'm protected from fraud. Also... Holding my Bitcoins is good as they appreciating due to all the noobs getting over excited and getting their mums to "invest" 
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:14:57
Yea, I cashed out a few hundred last april and made a tidy profit. Sure I would have made a ton had I kept them all for the last 6 months... But I think I would have had some serious stress issues. I have a couple now... I may buy more depending on what the US government have to say next week. Or when the price isn't damn near vertical. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:19:54
Namecoin and XRP (Ripple) are my top bets.
Namecoin as it has could make the net resistant to censorship and XRP as it provides access to the Ripple network which has certain advantages over Bitcoin. Its also backed my Google!

@_date: 2013-12-16 20:31:52
So they can still deposit and withdraw... just not from 3rd parties? That's not the end of the world then. its not like they have banned Bitcoin, they just want more control over it. By just channelling through banks they know who is holding Bitcoin and can better tax profits.

Nope... seems a lot of support around 600, think we will dance around there for a bit. You wont see $1000 for a while. It will come (next year), each iteration is bigger than the last by an order of magnitude. The next one will be epic, so make sure you come out of this with BTC.

@_date: 2013-11-11 22:14:17
They can't prevent the flow of electrons.. They can prevent legitimate business accepting them, and criminalise sites like local bitcoins. They won't kill bitcoin, but it's use in the US will be massively hindered for commerce. I think you overestimate the amount of fucks most people give about bitcoin... Nobody is voting your government out over their policy on something 99.9 % of people don't know or care about. Shit... Your government reads and records everything you do online and the sheep citizens have done fuck all... And will continue to do so.

If you gave me an address I could send you money now. Bitcoin is global. Bitcoin can't be inflated by a government and be worth les.s by printing more. Banks and PayPal and other middlemen can't take a cut of bitcoin, entities can't freeze your account and seize your assets, it's harder for the spies to monitor what you spend your money on, it will probably be worth much more in the future...cash will continue to head to zero. There are probably others...like it's a perfect money laundering tool, you can cross borders with it easily etc.

Except Ripple is not a copycat "alt coin"
Like Bitcoin:
Ripple is an open source,
 distributed peer-to-peer payment network
Ripple transactions are irreversible, sent over the Internet, and counterfeit proof
Ripple uses the same underlying cryptography as Bitcoin
Ripple has multi-signature support
Ripple has low to no transaction fees
Ripple servers can be run by anyone
Unlike Bitcoin:
Ripple can send any currency
Ripple can automatically exchange currencies
Ripple transactions are fully confirmed in seconds
Ripple allows nicknames and gravatar icons for accounts
Ripple's reference client is a Firefox and Chrome add on
Ripple has no block chain download, clients are ready in seconds
Ripple has no mining or direct monetary reward for running a server
Ripple has no currency risk as people can hold whatever fiat they want
Ripple solves the double spending problem with consensus instead of proof-of-work

Meh, I guess they are figuring what side they are on.

You only need a small amount of xrp to transact. But you can directly swap any currency (in theory). Many organisations (including my own) send money to foreign subsidiaries. But there is exchange risk and large costs hedging these. Ripple solves that problem so could be massive for big corporates. Sure they could use Bitcoin...but due to the huge volatility that's not possible (yet)...and may never be! It would be just too risky to send 1 million...time it wrong and you could lose loads.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:50:13
This time next year this wont mean shit... Bitcoin is the Honey Badger! ...sure it can get bitten by a snake, take a nap, wake up pissed and eat the snake for breakfast. I couldn't care less that Bitcoin is worth $300 or $700 dollars today. I want to hold Bitcoin. My Bitcoins are still worth the same number of Bitcoins I had before this. The fact that a Government has made a move against it, just means that it is REAL and not the virtual worthless sham some would have you believe.

Nope, Bitcoin was clearly in a speculation bubble... MtGox choked on the volume of trades and DDOSing. The Bubble could have gotten bigger, but it burst early.

It's dropped 50 percent? So...it was $12 a year ago! It's growth is still ridiculous...and it won't go to nothing as Bitcoin is still as radical as it was a month ago.

But its not sinking money in to the economy... in a way Bitcoin acts like quantitative easing! Bitcoin has effectively printed extra money which is expanding in value and making $'s worth less. Granted the impact is minimal at the moment... but taken to its extreme Bitcoin could take over like a virus and devalue the $, or any currency for that matter. They wont foster it as it has no benefits for them and they have no control over it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:26:15
That's very pessimistic... I can only see it happening if Bitcoin is illegal in their country. I don't think it is, but sure Banks hate Bitcoin so they are not going to make it easy. Business will just move to where it is legal though. I can see why US companies might (and do) have issues... even in the UK Blockchain.info had to stop selling Bitcoin. Nobody said inventing a global internet currency would be easy. Pretty unstoppable too... local bitcoins and similar would just take up the slack and prices will rise

We are all speculating on its future value... nobody knows what that will be! If there were a big Bitcoin economy of traders who accepted Bitcoin the price would be more stable. So too if the value was much higher as it would be too expensive to manipulate the market... by triggering panic sells and buying through walls. A lot of panic sellers lose money as the price rapidly recovers. I think people get used to the price going up, and then are amazed when it comes down!!

True, I don't know how hard it is where you're from for students to invest in regulated markets... but its far easier for them to invest in Bitcoin. What if they get the bug, lose a ton of money and their parents come in to lynch the teacher? I see Bitcoin as more of a gamble as the only thing driving the price is pure speculation... there are very few fundamentals underlying the current price rise, except the network effect of more people hearing about how their friends and relatives are making free money. Its an interesting case study granted, if I were a teacher I would however be careful how I approach it. I know it is not... but it is acting very much like a ponzi scheme at the moment. Even my Mum wants to buy some and she couldn't give a shit about Bitcoins utility as a currency. She wants to buy because the price is going up... just like the majority here.

Speculators are leaving as they wont be seeing profits for a long time, and some are cutting their losses, traders are leaving as there is less money to be made from the speculators, and big money is leaving as Bitcoin is no longer 'the next big thing'.
This is all compounded by people selling because they think the price will go down. Its a self fulfilling prophecy.

Why? We already had a big crash... what makes you think we are due to go deeper?
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:21:44
Absolutely is happening every day... except the bit about 600 above market price. They only need to buy enough to get people panic buying "because the price is getting away!" Once the price is over what the "millionaires" paid for their coins... they sell making a profit. If their plan succeeds people panic sell thinking the price is crashing. They then buy back at the lower price, and repeat. This has been going on for a long time and will continue to do so. Until maybe Bitcoins are too expensive to do this without a ridiculous amount of money. Then we will be stable, until then you will see the wild fluctuations we see everyday. To mitigate this, buy during a dip, and dont panic sell.

It depends on what sort of crisis we are talking... if the US keep printing your money into extinction or China decide to get rid of their trillions of $'s which they have stockpiled... I think many (tech savvy) people would pump some cash in to Bitcoin. There is a real possibility of a US $ collapse in the coming years... 17 trillion in debt and rising is just an accident waiting to happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:56:42
I would say a large proportion of bitcoin holders are from the US. If the utility of use and ability to buy bitcoin is hindered then confidence and demand will drop. European countries may also see their actions as a blueprint for action too. The US have banned alternate currencies before.

How was he talking shit... he called a bubble which would pop. It did, now we are at 50% of where we were. True Bitcoin is a new beast, but the psychology and movements of markets in general are very applicable to Bitcoin.

Be prepared for more fights in the future... I would bet Europe as a whole will try and pull some of this shit in the future. If you are scared of Government action, then Bitcoin is not for you.

It's not reaching critical mass during this iteration... people are not using Bitcoin as a currency! How much of your .31 have you spent? How much do you intend to spend? None? There lies the problem... its not currently being adopted it is a speculatory gamble! Long term will it take off? Maybe... I have a few Bitcoins. I however sold a few hundred back in April as ultimately fiat is more useful to me. I may also buy more... depends on how the US Gov act later this month. If I were a betting man I can see this getting to $600 or so... the the US Gov put in some policies, then the grandmothers and people who dont give a crap about Bitcoin will want to get out!!! Even those who love Bitcoin will sell as they dont want their funds to devalue. This could be a massive collapse!!!

There are all sorts of people 'manipulating' the market. That's the price you have to pay for an unregulated currency. 
Some of those DDOSing are probably just kids who want to feel powerful, not necessarily buy Bitcoin. 
Could also be any Government in the World trying to nip this in the bud. The Silk Road alone would be good enough reason to hit Bitcoin. 
I would guess that more than 80% of people who buy Bitcoin are hoping to make a profit. Greed is human nature.. don't be mad at it.

I feel violated, I have to self censor everything I do online for fear of being wrongly labeled by some bot. Terrorists aren't stupid, they probably don't use the internet at all. Our governments cause the terrorism by invading THEIR lands, stealing their oil and killing their families. 9-11 was bad... but more allied soldiers died fighting in the revenge wars than died in the attacks. That is just stupid. I would prefer a higher risk of being blown up by a terrorist (statistically very small chance) than being spied on and scrutinized 24/7.

Meh, it's a pretty shit currency at the moment. But that's to be expected, it's only a baby! Merchants aren't just going to materialize out of thin air...it takes time. Bitcoin is more than a currency though...It's a payment protocol and a commodity. There is a vibrant black market which uses Bitcoin very successfully as a currency, even if it stays underground it still has room for massive growth. If you don't see it, that's cool...you may be correct. Time will tell. I'm betting India will start buying loads or even some small country with a shitty currency will adopt it in the coming years...I'm enjoying this ride immensely, you should get involved!

Well kind of... You are gambling that the US or Chinese government don't regulate,  you are gambling that a floor isn't found with the bitcoin system,  that a superior competitor doesn't take off,  that there aren't inside traders who can see upcoming trades on the exchange... This is after all an unregulated market! I think the biggest gamble is that you are gambling that everyone here is really only interested in making money and couldn't give a shit about bitcoin. I'm not that heavily involved with bitcoin now... But last year I was,  at the start the gamble was worth the amount I had invested... When the value had multiplied by 10 the gamble wasn't worth that much to me so I sold and got that lovely cash. I still have some btc , but it's just fun now :-)

Nobody knows...conceivably it will get less volatile when it is multiple thousands per coin as it will be too costly for traders to manipulate the market. Also if there were a stable economy underneath of merchants who accept it volatility would reduce. I can't imagine a replacement which could be stable...unless it's government backed, which we already have.

I dont think they will ban it either...  unless they just ban US businesses from accepting it. They will probably just make it so businesses need to know their customers...i.e, you need to show some ID when paying with Bitcoin. I think this will spook the speculators, of which account for probably 80%! I think the price will be back to $200... thats just a guess though. Who knows, all very interesting!

I thought it had succeeded in April... Success for bitcoin is thousands per coin. I get what you are doing and why... but if I have learnt anything it's not to underestimate the honey badger. Sure there could be a major correction... In six moths, when we are taking in bits rather than bitcoins your success might seem rather small. (As mine does from April). I too thought the easy money had gone, but seriously... I'm the only person I know who even owns bitcoin... this is a fraction of its potential. Well done on holding for the last 7 months... I don't think I could have handled the stress. It's easy for me now though

A rational commentary on Bitcoin! I get frustrated by those who believe we are dislodging any Government with this... never going to happen. 
I may be paranoid, but although Fincen gave it legitimacy, I think the Governments of the world would like to see Bitcoin fail. Perhaps they are letting it fly for fear of what could replace it?
A truly anonymous currency perhaps?

Perhaps you missed the recent Snowden leaks which showed that the NSA has had only very limited success in identifying TOR users through methods such as browser hacks. I don't see how the UK would be ahead of the US in this regard.

I suspect the Silk Road take down was largely due to good old fashioned Police work.

I know the US government / NSA are a bunch of evil cunts... but they have yet to show they will outright steal money from innocent people. Though they may need to to repay the ridiculous debt the US is in. 
If they have intercepted my Laptop and installed some sort of device at US taxpayers expense (I'm not in the US)... just to steal Bitcoins I would be surprised. I don't think I'm being naive. 
I use an encrypted Armory wallet on a fresh install of Linux. I don't want things to get even more inconvenient. If we have to all use cold storage to stop the NSA from stealing our coins... we might as well sell them now.

This has a 50% chance of being a bubble
This has a 50% chance of being an S curve (i,e. going to keep going)
I have a feeling it could drop due to the senate meeting, but Bitcoin is very very unpredictable... it could keep going just to spite the meeting!

I've been on here for a long time (a year before my current account)... I'm fully aware of what the group think is like here. I don't really care about a couple of downvotes... probably because I mentioned Ripple. I too hope Bitcoin becomes worth thousands as I have a good position. But I'm not joining the pump crowd who are blinkered and I try to maintain a more level headed and open minded approach. This subreddit is ridiculous sometimes as it is a complete echo chamber... it's wise to broaden your view. Tools such as Ripple actually work very well with Bitcoin... it can do things BTC can't. If a virtual currency is invented which confirms instantly, is actually anonymous and has fewer attack vectors and is more secure.. it could certainly gain the network effect rapidly. Likewise, there is room for more than one. I see Bitcoin more as a commodity than a currency. There are plenty of commodities, there can be multiple successful virtual commodities. If this is against the group beliefs here... that's cool. If we all have the same opinion that is unhealthy.

Perhaps they have a low risk appetite?  Bitcoin is either going to be thousands or zero.  Perhaps they believe that if something is too good to be true, it is.

Personally I think regulation is coming... taken to its extreme, if Bitcoin becomes massive it means we can keep all our savings out of their eyes, people can launder vast quantities of money through mixing services, people can be anonymously blackmailed with no paper trail, terrorists and pedophiles can trade more easily across boarders and people can be paid without taxes. Criminal gangs can't have their assets frozen... the list goes on. The Government will (do) hate what Bitcoin can do... it takes power from them. I can't see how they wont try to act. At present perhaps not all the old folk in charge even understand what it is! But it literally threatens their entire system... a system which we live in! The majority of my assets are in fiat, in many ways I don't want Bitcoin to succeed as it could reduce the value of my fiat based assets! Making our own money (Bitcoim) is sort of like quantitative easing of our own design!!! It adds to the money pool decreasing fiats value even more!

Those who invest more than they can afford to lose will also learn some valuable lessons. I believe Bitcoin has a big future...if it didn't, why is a large government scared of it?

I don't want to see that, it's terrifying... Although it could make me wealthy. People have been warning people off bitcoin for years, if I had listened to them I would have made much less profit. If people can afford to gamble some cash,  a small downside for a potentially massive upside then let them. It could reach 1000 before it implodes. What if this is the next big thing? This could be the Internet monetizing itself and become the future reserve currency of the world. Things happen fast in cyberspace. Would I buy more now? No... But I'm not selling them either.

I dont know where its going, but you are clearly wanting people to sell to validate your decision. One thing we have seen is that it is the holders who do well in the long game.

Whilst they cannot kill Bitcoin, I'm pretty sure whatever they do will hit the price. They have shown in recent months they hate anonymity and encryption! They are not going to give up and say... sure keep your funds hidden and let shops have income they dont need to declare for taxes. They could quite easily ban US businesses from accepting Bitcoin or make so many hurdles as to make its use very difficult. If a business has to know who they are accepting funds from that would be bad news for Bitcoin. If I had to give a shop my ID when paying with Bitcoin I for one would just give them cash or use a card instead. All they have to do is play the terror card.

The value of that free ripple you got is largely irrelevant. Its not meant to be hoarded to hell like Bitcoin. They are giving away most of it whilst the inventors keep some. 
Fuck them for wanting to profit hey!
I couldn't care if my few XRP go up in value... that's Bitcoin mentality! How about a useful and instant payment system that doesn't kill the environment or deflate to hell in continual boom and busts?
If you don't understand Ripple best disregard it... move on then and not try to get it.

One day I believe Bitcoin will bubble up and stay up as it will be supported by a thriving digital economy. At the moment its full of speculators. The dot com bubble probably looked like that chart... check out the situation now :)
