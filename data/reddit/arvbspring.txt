If you believe that then you've already decided it has no value. You believe this even though people all over the world have converted their money to crypto to avoid the effects of an unstable government on their savings, and their decision to use it as a store of wealth has proven to be an extremely good look. 
That right there is a use, and even if bitcoin or whatever crypto they used stayed the same value it would be a good idea, and that's ignoring the fact that many primary coins have skyrocketed in value since then.

Don't buy or sell anything unless you have protection and shipping insurance (via paypal, ebay, etc.)
If there is no incentive or penalty for shipping you your item or sending you the money then every time the person orchestrating the deal will dick you over, and you can't really blame them because why would they pay if they don't have to?

Trumpists will do literal mental gymnastics to convince themselves that he and Putin are somehow mavericks. 
How there are people that believe Putin's brand of authoritarianism or Trumps brand of croneyism (willingness to let Jeff Sessions infringe on states rights, letting a super-conglomerate decide what content people can view online, etc.) are at all in line with Libertarian ideology is beyond me.

You may be right about this, honestly I've been persuaded before and I could see myself agreeing in the near future.
That being said, the problem for me is when lack of regulation leads to what we may see occur with issues like net neutrality. While I believe that eventually (we don't know if that means years or decades) the market will produce providers that compete with the current conglomerates, thus allowing individuals to choose internet providers that will not restrict their access to certain websites or bandwidth throttle others, in the short term this will give an authoritarian level of power to these corporations regarding information flow/access which to me is absolutely terrifying. I can guarantee one of the first things to go will be access to torrent and streaming sites that offer intellectual property for free, thats not even up for debate. It will really start to get dystopian when the political preferences of those who have stakes in these conglomerates begins to dictate what news and forums you have access to (this may seem paranoid but in the era of fake news it's really not that much of a stretch).

What would you call having children? By your logic nobody should ever want to invest in a child, as you're taking on a massive monetary burden with little or no promise of return. Yet most people on earth choose to make this decision, over and over. 
Sometimes you put your money towards something because you believe in it, other times it's because you want to help change the world for the better. Not everything is about 'gains', crypto has more to offer the world than making all it's original investors rich.

Maybe I'm a bit more centered than most, but TBH most anarcho-leftist groups I'm a part of exhibit this same distrust of the government in it's current state, and it's hard not to believe that corruption will always take control the larger that government becomes. Even with previous communist governing bodies, after a certain amount of growth many became as bad as the capitalist societies they were supposedly rebelling against, and eventually morphed into an authoritarian nightmare. Socialism works best on a small scale IMO, and will be less corrupt if you can prevent it from becoming centralized around a single individual or small group.

You could say the exact same thing about various states, which was my original point... There are states where this would work just as you've described (not everyone will use the public hospitals, as those who have the means really shouldn't be using them anyway) and there are states where it would not. Just like Europe, America is not a unified region (as much as we would like to convince you otherwise). This is why we have legal marijuana in california and Jeff Sessions talking about sending the feds in to intervene. 
Just as with Europe, there are HUGE variations in values, work ethic, concentration of wealth, etc. I could genuinely see socialized healthcare working somewhere like New York, but not in most states. 
That is precisely why Scandinavia vs Europe as a whole is an example worth using when discussing the feasibility of socialized healthcare on a smaller scale, and it's infeasibility on a larger one.

Before anyone talks shit about this, MDMA was originally produced to be utilized in psychotherapy and showed a TON of promise in treating PTSD and use in couples therapy. 
It wasn't made illegal until it's wide use at raves in the late 80's and early 90's. Also, most ill effects of MDMA are due to it's adulteration with other substances (methamphetamine, bath salts, speed, etc.) which isn't an issue with clinical trials. MDMA on its own, in small doses, is relatively safe.

True but IMO if done on a state-by-state basis this might not be as pronounced. The idea that a one-size-fits-all set of laws can be applied to an area as big as the US seems silly, especially given the extreme variation in economic opportunity, quality of life, quality of education, etc between states. 
Basically I believe the government should be offering access to things such as socialized healthcare while simultaneously being prevented from overreach in the lives of individuals. I honestly don't care if they regulate large corporations as long as they do so in a way that benefits the lower and working class individuals these corporations make a profit from.

Bitcoin has a lot of momentum right now, more than many of these fringe (but immeasurably important) causes they've been supporting.

Developing a crypto currency does not help with it's mass adoption, at all. Buying into that currency and encouraging others to do the same does, as more people will have a reason to want that currency to succeed. Right now crypto is manipulated solely BECAUSE it is not yet ubiquitous, coinbase was easily able to pump Bcash because it's like the only exchange that anyone casually uses (solely bc of it UI). Imagine if there were thousands? Do you see where I am going with this?


Pretty much, yeah. Most American's think their country is un-sinkable despite the fact it's only really existed as a power for about 100 years. In the grand scheme of things thats not very long.

People thought it was the end of the world because they had little to compare it to. Hell, there are now liberals who are reminiscing about the Bush years for god's sake.

Actually I am the one saying it's feasible, didn't cite you outside of discussing Scandinavia, and as someone who actually lives in NY and is native I can say we have a much stronger sense of community and feeling of cultural 'otherness' when compared to people in other parts of the US. Yes part of that culture is a sense of individualism and to outsiders a seeming lack of concern but I've never once seen an instance where someone needed help on the streets and 4-5 people didn't come to that person's aid. It's mostly transplants that see NY as this free for all, meaning on both a city and state basis, and have no real sense of community outside of whatever trendy neighborhood they decided to help gentrify.

This is changing due to general lack of trust placed in the government. There was a time where I genuinely believed gun ownership was unnecessary and would only lead to more violence.

You can be leftist without believing solely in communist ideology. 
I honestly don't think we're as different as the media would have everyone believe, and that we may have more to learn from one another than anyone would like to admit. 
I had to work through my own personal aversion to gun rights years ago, realizing how irrational it was and that I'd want our government and it's appointed few to be the only ones with the ability to defend themselves. 
Similarly, I've seen libertarians who previously had no interest realize the importance of class consciousness and protection through unions and other semi-socialist constructs. 
Personally, I see the promise of bitcoin as a way to protect what little compensation I get for my labor from the possibility of seizure by the government. I also see it as facilitating transactions over the web that our government frowns upon (ex. IMO most narcotics should be legal for personal use) and as an outlet for gains outside of fueling the shittyness of the stock market and lining the pockets of the upper class.

Most Libertarians don't really care about marginalized groups though, and while they are right about many things (gun rights, government overreach, etc) I can't agree with many of them about the effectiveness of capitalism. It's flawed in it's current state to the point where a brand of socialism might be vastly preferable (IMO) as it currently produces a fairly parasitic relationship in which the upper class feeds on the disenfranchisement of the lower.

The entire speculative worth of bitcoin is based on the notion that they will maintain their relevancy/value. By this logic you wouldn't have to exchange for fiat currency, ever, as they'll eventually be adopted as a spendable asset (probably in a much smaller denomination than 1 btc, maybe .00001 btc). If these funds are being pulled directly from a private wallet (however that might work) you could spend it as you do cash, without the IRS breathing down your neck.

True but it's beyond frustrating. When will exchanges catch up to the traffic/demand? it's not like they aren't making enough money to do so...
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:06:44
Obviously, but they were developed together. You can't just decontextualize a technologies introduction and pretend bitcoin had nothing to do with it...

Finally dips again and coinbase shuts down purchases...

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:43
yes, because we're all carrying around bars of gold to pay for shit
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:53:28
That wouldn't be bitcoin failing, unless you're just using it to cash in on hype. Once back down to ~$1000 it would be useful as a currency again so technically it would be bitcoin succeeding at it's original purpose

You trump dick riders will force him into any conversation 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:46:00

Pretty much this, plus he's like a libertarian idol and that accounts for a large portion of his sub.
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:39:30
Your analogy is off and you're seriously reaching to defend bcash by the looks of it, the word "dollar" here is closer to the word "coin" which almost every single cryptocurrency uses in their name lmao
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:30:03
The US dollar has always been referred to as USD not "dollars" that's some America-centric nonsense, the term dollar is Czech in origin 
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:15:15
People aren't disputing the use of 'bitcoin' in the name of another cryptocurrency, they're disputing the attempted revisionist nonsense that the Bcash team clearly supports in which "bitcoin cash" is somehow the grandfather of every cryptocurrency and actual bitcoin is simply some beta version

not a libertarian, but yes
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:55:08
Yeah well anarcho-capitalist's believe a lot of WILD shit, I've seen some argue that slavery is fine and should be re-adopted in first world nations. Point being even if you're an anarchist you might not want to align yourself with ancaps, some of them are absolutely batshit.

This thread isn't going to go over well in a space full of right-leaning libertarians, but I think it's important to remember that as a possible re-distribution of wealth the changes that could potentially come from crypto taking off will be of great importance for whichever group can, or already has, gotten an early foothold.
If women want to spearhead this power/wealth re-distribution more power to them, but as of right now I don't see it which is a shame, I want to see people taking the potential of crypto seriously enough to be vying for that spot 
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:22:01
I DISAGREE
