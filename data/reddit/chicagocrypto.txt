What if you invest in equities, indices, commodities, and currencies using bitcoin settled CFDs with 1Broker?
Is it fair to say that I've allocated 30% to US equities, 30% towards long US Dollar vs Euro, and 40% towards SP Index, but on top of Bitcoin?

Maidsafe.org is close to making this a reality.  Expected for release to beta testers Q1 of next year.

To correct your statement you should really only thank the person or people who bought your borrowed bitcoin at 925.  After that buyers hurt your potential profit by a declining price.  Good for you though, nice trade.

I don't think the application or use case has been developed or thought of just yet that will cause major user adoption.  Hopefully now that the core will be worked on again along with innovations like sidechains,  something will exist soon.

Just visited and bought 3 smoothies.  Spoke with the owner and he said that word has been spreading from advertising on forums. Transaction couldn't have gone smoother!

Excellent points and I agree that something easier than QR codes is needed for the non-tech crowd in order to break free from paper money.  Currently, credit cards are MUCH easier to use than QR codes.  I like the idea of Bluetooth LE and hands-free payment, but am curious about the security involved with such a process.  For instance, if there are 10 people in line all looking to pay using Bluetooth LE and the cashier presses the button to extract payment, where's the control that takes it from the correct person's wallet?  Perhaps this is where the wearable device comes in play so that the customer can either press a confirmation button or tap their wrist against a payment pad at the checkout counter... either way, this seems years in the future but seems like it could work.

Bitcoin is volatile enough to trade and fees aren't that high using bitfinex (plus you can sell short).  Just know your stop loss BEFORE entering every trade to take emotion out of the equation.

Just purchased using btc.  What a great and simple experience.  No credit card numbers, no logging in (since I was already logged into coinbase), no hassle.  This is how easy shopping online should be.

The article does have valid points in regards to how ETFs make money.  Passive funds such as the proposed bitcoin ETF should have very small management fees since the goal of the fund will be to simply replicate the spot price of btc.  However, for those who are tech savvy and are comfortable securing their own btc (or using a web wallet/vault such as coinbase), you'll receive higher returns using this method.
The ETF will still serve a large crowd who are not tech savvy and still want to speculate in the potential upside of btc.  There will also be a crowd who are tech savvy but wish to invest a portion of their IRA into btc; this will be the only way to currently do so.
Journalism on bitcoin I'm finding is more of uninformed opinions than anything.

Something must be going on with coinbase as my Trezor is pushing to the network just fine.  My coinbase transactions are all stuck pending without showing on the network.
