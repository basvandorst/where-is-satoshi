What is considered valuable on a market requires more than 1 person.

I love Charlie Lee and my Litecoin :)

Bitcoin with Lightning will be faster and cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:06:28
Lol. How's it going buddy? Hope you're getting paid enough. Lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:16:43
Serious question. I want to know your logic for your stance on coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:05:44
You can say that about any coin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:14:29
No it does not imply they are building a new crypto. Charlie Lee has always said that Litecoin is his baby that he want's to see succeed. If anything it would be looking to integrate Litecoin into Facebook if this speculation is true.

Your pessimism was insightful into Coinbase's operations. Thanks. /s

GRS coin? Haven't heard of it. It must not be in the top 100. I don't really care who implements what first but Litecoin has a large share of the market and can be the catalyst for Lightning that brings Bitcoin along. Segwit wasn't implemented in Bitcoin because of GRS but because of Litecoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:51:52
None. It can't be on the Lightning Network, currently it needs SegWit. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:43:03
SegWit is a precursor to Lightning. But yeah I agree, though I doubt they will add LN right away.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:13:01
Why do they not deserve the benefit of the doubt?
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:29:17
Do you fork?
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:18:10
Death by 1000 cuts. It will take time for lightning and adoption to come in but yeah, it's useless. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:40:17
Are you pro Bcrash?
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:30:47
Can you explain?

That's why I'm 90% in bed with Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:05:08
This is all new to me but from my understanding, this is what Litecoin can be used for - To get the tech out and into the market.

Any funds to help pay for my astronaut training school would be greatly appreciated. PM me for address. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:47:34
That was a statement not an argument - Learn to read. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:52:11
No idea. I have a couple but that's just out of principal to diversify. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:22:31
It also have been around since 2011 unlike most other coins. The lead developer was the Director of Engineering for Coinbase. I can go on but I'm not trying to convince you, just want to say that it's worth your time to look into and do the research yourself.

Most people start off investing in Bitcoin as a way to make fast money. Then they realize that it can be used as cash, but the fees are too high. Then they learn about Litecoin and the low fees but are like it takes 2 minutes for my transaction to go through! But once LN is up they'd be like weeeeeee! Best of both worlds!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:33:26
FUCK TRUMP
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:02:35
1 in a million for LTC goal. Can't be 1 in a million for BTC since that would mean I'd have to own 21 bitcoin and the price just keeps going up. 
Also LTC has better tech than BTC so I believe that it will have its day. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:42:32
lol yeah. Actually I think I should amend my statement to if the US switches to BTC 1 satoshi will be $100. :P
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:26:26
I wouldn't message you about Bitcoin but you're in r/bitcoin

Bitcoin is worthless if no one spends any. Don't you know, money makes the world go round. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 06:32:54
I think a software update would be able to increase the decimal place. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:51:00
Because the current system already is unequal. This new framework at least provides a level playing ground for everyone which is a huge improvement. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:02:52
And how do we trust that a central organization will be fair?
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:00:54
This vaguely reminds me of a story of a rich king, Persian maybe, who was so wealthy he destroyed local economies with what he considered a tip. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:56:34
Lol, you are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:20:45
What would it take to start a new coin that is 100% fair? What is fair? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:34:24
Ok. How do you do that?
edit: forgot the u in you.

If it's happening while he sleeps he wrote a program.

My goal is 1 btc and 84 ltc.  Almost there.
