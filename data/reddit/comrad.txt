Once he said that there are no third parties involved. On the other hand he talk about his 90$/h consultant.

Wuala offers bitcoin payment as well, and offers a huge bitcoin discount (

So do they fear paper money as well?

Cool, you just added it! Thanks, but i guess 50$ for a bread (38$ shipping to germany) is a little heavy ;)

stay... until your website is gone? It is btw.
@_date: 2012-08-16 13:28:25
Good thing, the site seems down now.

Sure, the same as driving your car may reduce the lifespan of your car.

The pricing should really be on the front page.

Please also point out where you delivery to and for how much. I would love to order, but i guess your fresh bread won't be that fresh anymore when it arrives in Europe :-/ too sad, open a franchise in germany (please, please, pretty please!)

also try  which i use to buy and sell bitcoins.

It is indeed. Because it's alpha staged and they process it manually you get a discount. I payed 2 BTC for 20 GB.

But that's not what would be covered in mainstream media. I guess it would read more like this: "Virtual Bitcoin currency involved in kidnapping incident".

They've accepted bitcoins a long time ago. In the HumbleBundles. 
They now accept them as well in the Humble Store!
