ok, sorry. I tend to be a tad extreme in my views. Apologies.

But without Rulers there would be no roads &amp; who will save us from the terrorists !

pretty shocking... I look forward to the day when those responsible face justice for their *policies &amp; decisions* that leave millions of people working 50 hours a week &amp; drowning in debt. It will never come from our "leaders" because they ARE the very filth that sneaks this BS onto the unsuspecting masses. How many single moms are out there working their asses off &amp; feeling bad about themselves, blaming themselves when the system has been designed to bailout the scummiest of the sociopaths on the backs of those who actually have to work hard for their money... We need a reshuffling of the current hierarchy.

LOL wrong ! Your understanding of Libertarianism does not resemble Libertarianism. The non-aggression principle is closer to what Jesus &amp; the Buddha preached. "Obey whoever has money" could not be more wrong. Government can ONLY exist using aggression &amp; threats of aggression. So yes, against violence = against government, sooner or later, we will all have to tackle this little annoyance.

Sorry if I insult your intelligence with this link. Many people still believe in a Santa-Claus-like Uncle Sam. If this describes you, skip over this vid. No offense meant.

To any libertard circlejerkers who may object to everyone getting fingerprinted to deal in bitcoin, this is just a necessary first step, soon our benevolent Authorities will implement a convenient chip that goes in your forehead or right hand &amp; then we can all deal in bitcoin &amp; sleep well at night, knowing the terrorists won't be able to use bitcoin. Trust us, this is progress :)

This is all due to the state. These behaviours are cultivated &amp; promoted by the state. Ever wonder why liars run the government, why sociopaths run corporations, why abusive personality traits are sought out by law enforcement. Why people are encouraged to go on welfare &amp; not produce anything of value but rather watch tv all day ? If this is the best society you can imagine then I pity you. The rest of us *get it*, please do not get in the way of our collective evolution. You can still watch sports &amp; drink beer. It's all good.

being under high tension ones gives you a constant shower of positive ions, which is a little bad but not as bad as cell phone radiation, so you've got bigger things to worry about. :)
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:57:07
&amp; how many people have *you* killed recently ? How many people have killed you ? because 250 million have been killed by "the state" in the 1900's alone...

War &amp; employment is not what I meant. Throwing someone in jail is violence against them. &amp; you can be thrown in jail for driving your car too fast. Threatening someone with jail if they don't pay taxes that then using those funds to kill "terrorists" is also aggression. Theft. This what I'm referring to when I say governments cannot exist without the threat of violence against individuals. If governments &amp; their policies were optional, you could fund &amp; support whoever's policies you agreed with, we'd be closer to a Libetarian world.

Thanks for keeping it more pure. The last few years have seen bitcoin producing higher returns than owning a sweatshop or cutting down the rainforest. I look forward to when p2pool mining is more profitable than mining at Ghash...

These *not taught in school* ideas are a case of *you either get it or you don't*. Much like bitcoin. "But who will build the roads?" is like when a non bitcoiner says "It can't have value if it's just ones &amp; zeros in a computer." If you have the intelligence &amp; interest &amp; actually take the time to investigate the root causes of what is going on in our world today, then it may dawn on you that a future without rulers is not only possible but a natural progression from where we are now. Stefan linking taxes to war. *not taught in school* ideas...

You cant say it's impossible until the end of the universe... too many variables -&gt; an accurate predicter could arrive eventually.

a black hole ! but bitcoin would have to go to the moon for that to work.

Sorry for my smugness, but your same arguments have been used throughout history to argue against any major evolution... When the printing press arrived, some people argued that without the authority's monopoly on "truth" &amp; printed text, chaos &amp; insanity in the populace would ensue... The only reason most people these days can't organize &amp; act for themselves is because we all share this belief that there is a benevolent group we elect that will look over us much like a parent does, but this is not the reality. The reality is that power corrupts &amp; all people must take responsibility for their actions or others will take advantage of them. &amp; this is what we see in our war filled world where no individual truly wants war yet we see it everywhere. Why do you think that is? A corrupt government full of liars is *not* the reason we have roads or healthcare. Humans are perfectly capable of negotiating &amp; organizing &amp; implementing solution to problems we have in our lives... We do not need rulers to have order. I suspect it is actually the complete opposite. We need responsible equals if we ever want peaceful &amp; prosperous co-existence. Again, sorry if I appeared smug or condescending, but it can be difficult having opinions that differ so much from the norm &amp; it can be frustrating at times too. :)

He's a founder of bitcoin magazine ! Many articles linked from this sub to that site, that we've all been reading for years are his writings.

Vitalik is invaluable to bitcoin. I very much respect his opinion &amp; I'm glad he would speak his mind like that.
