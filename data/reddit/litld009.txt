So is there any detriment to moving my funds from legacy to Segwit on my ledger? Can I still trade it to b
Other legacy addresses from the segwit one?
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:21:42
Thanks, I'm starting to get the impression that coins with a higher daily volume and a lower market cap would be more likely to rise.
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:54:24
The thing that sucks for me is that I was remodeling my house and held as long as I could. Ran out of money when it was at the low and had to sell half. Was able to buy about 1/3 of what I sold back but still cost me a pretty penny. Nothing I could do though needed to pay bills.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:19:17
And you can also do the reverse.  Send BTC to GDAX and cash it out if you so desire on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:03:47
You should... I do always :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:39:44
why only make 5% I'm pushing it to 10% lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:39:55
I tried to buy at the low this morning and it didn’t look like my order went through. Panicked and doubled up the order. Both ended up going through. Not upset about it!
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:53:55
And I can't wait to buy more if we see 9-10k again!
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:41:16
If you're actually asking.  GDAX is what I use.  It is the exchange that coinbase uses and you can put some money on the exchange and set limits and buy and sell without having to wait for the BTC to clear each time.  I was able to buy and sell 3x in the last day making about 10% each time.  Its fun!
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:04:12
Look at you doing LOTS like the HODL thing... clever clever
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:35:21
Thanks for this information.  I knew something was up with i saw how many ripple coins were available.  It makes me feel like the penny stocks that have 1b shares or the marijuana stocks with 100b shares.  I'm a little disappointed it went up to .80c and pushed the market cap up so much.  Do you guys know anything about Monero? one of my friends was talking about it.  Let me know if i need to drop off and join another thread for this too
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:40:12
I third this more than i can say.  GDAX is an amazing platform that is backed by coinbase.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:00:33
Am I the only one around here that's happy its stabilizing around $14.5k?  It can't continue parabolic and I expected a bigger dip... am still expecting it 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:20:44


Why are you Bull on XLM? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:42:40
Me too,  I am still HODLing my base position but i've been having fun playing in the GDAX market buying and selling today between 14k and 16k.  With the futures coming I'm not sure what to do.  I have buys set all the way down to 8k and sells all the way up to 16k lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:42
I have no debt and a fully funded emergency fund. Enough disposable income to test the crypto waters without touching my retirement or anything that will affect my future 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:00:33
Love me some limit orders. Yesterday paid for Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:21:34
I learned this after the first drop. Got a couple lucky buys in today at the bottom!
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:33:56
I wouldn't say it looks boring.  It already has a 6B market Value!  Some other people were excited about RaiBlocks too.  I guess everyone has a different horse they're betting on, but I don't think the banks are going away.  They are adapting as our world is adapt or die.  It's why I almost bought ripple at $0.25 and talked myself out of it because I got distracted by the decentralization machine.  I love the idea of it but the reality imo is we will in the near future now have a choice between decentralization and centralization.
@_date: 2019-03-15 21:47:48
Wow What is another platform that people use and trust? Is there any without maker fees?
@_date: 2019-03-16 16:18:45
Ah ok. Then I’ll just stick with them 
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:42:09
But even if it supports a different chain after the fork couldn't we just pull our original BTC into blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:55:18
I guess I meant it in a way to ask if there is a good litecoin wallet or If I should trade through coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:27:04
Ok,  how do i trade litecoin.  I only have mine sitting on the Coinbase exchange.  So others are upset about fees is that why we are having so many hard forks to improve it?  
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:45:33
Thank you for this meme. Lol
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:14:57
So literally Bart Simpson’s head. Lol
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:58:07
What is BART?
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:07:33
Probably, I just checked and I had a balance on there to move out.  The last I heard is that coinbase was funding the BCH sometime in January 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:44:47
There are a couple of options if you follow the link they give you on the box.  I opened up the Ledger to look at the hardware and verified it had the original chip set.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:20:49
4 business days. I forget when I made the transfer but it was awhile 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:44:03
I ordered mine from a 3rd party site on Amazon because in order to get it to my location it would take 2-3 weeks.  So I wanted to be sure the 3rd party didn't change anything out on it.  It had great reviews and after verifying it was good to go! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:22:19
Yeah at the time of the first fork I took it out of coinbase because it wasn't being supported.  I just need to get some information and grab my BCH but I don't know a trusted service for it.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:45:55
Yeah I added the chrome app.  I guess for some reason I was thinking it would show my balances on the actual Ledger as well.  With only being able to see the balance on the Chrome app it feels more like the coins are being held on an exchange or server opposed to my actual ledger
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:14:00
It seems like i did everything right then.  I even got my BCH!  Of course I bought it really because I was looking to be sure I would receive coins from the Segwit2x split and now it looks like it has been cancelled.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:13:08
Yeah I have a couple buys in right now at $7k, in case of a random dip.  If you have the extra cash I would keep some in there.  Also if you have a coinbase account you have a GDAX account, they are the same company just GDAX is an exchange.  You just need to re verify some information.  If you're not used to trading on an exchange watch a couple youtube videos on how it works.  Very simple. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:16:18
I still don't know where to get my coins from the last fork.  I have some BCH floating around the universe... oh and I just checked its up to $500/BCH! woot!
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:22:03
Oh wow!  Where do you recommend sending it to?  Is this something Ledger or Trezor will hold?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:39:16
GDAX fees are significantly less.  In fact I can put a limit order in and wait for a specific price and pay $0.  A market order, which is what you do when you purchase on coinbase, costs something like 0.25%.  So it depends on if you're a trader trying to play the game or in for the HODL.  I didn't realize all of this when I put $$ into GDAX or I would have just bought on Coinbase since I just plan to HODL
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:30:16
Ok perfect.  Can I order a Ledger on Amazon securely?  
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:18:58
I almost bought a ledger wallet.  I'm debating between that and a Trezor right now.  How do forks work with regards to a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:50:13
I’m finally in the green too!  Had some fun day trading today. Don’t recommend it for the faint of heart but during the flash crash I was able to make a couple hundred and end up with my positions before it climbed back up over $13k. Just enough to buy another ETH woot!
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:39:23
Haha same happened to me.  I sent $$ into GDAX and didn't realize it took 4 days to clear.  Finally bought in at $7750.  Oh well happy to HODL my original position!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:30:29
Same for me, my last buy was at $4300, which seemed high. Before that it was $2700.  I put some money into GDAX exchange trying to buy the dip but didn't realize i had to wait 5 days for it to clear.  Oh well, next time i guess.
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:06:07
Thanks! Yeah I have most on my Ledger. Just this last bit I was trading a bit. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:27:01
I've seen a couple of you all mention taxes. With bitcoin being a currency why do you have to pay taxes on it. What's the difference if I buy gold at $1300 and hodl it for 2 years and sell it at $2600. I don't see how there is a way to track it. Rather how it is considered extra income. Also. Since I can buy gold on websites with bitcoin what's stopping me from converting my currency into a precious metal without getting taxed. At some point after you move it around enough times you lose what the original investment was. Especially if I then sell my gold for cash. What am I missing here? Ethics?
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:42:03
Thanks this makes a lot of sense, I guess i never realized about selling currency and the capital gains taxes.  I'm used to claiming my capital gains on stocks because its all digital so it shows up and i add it on a form for my taxes.  I imagine this is the way we had to handle stocks before it went all digital.  Not to mention I also have never sold any of the metals I've bought lol.  I'll make sure to keep a better log of my initial investments on BTC.  Last question here however is if i'm buying multiple times at multiple prices do i take my average investment price if I partially sell?
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:06:20
I thought this was very informative. Anyone disagree?
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:38:46
Taxes are dumb. I mean. IRS if you're listening they're great!
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:51:17
Am I the only one who believes in the tech and wants to make a few bucks?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:01:43
God damn where's my crystal ball 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:03:09
The only thing I'm upset about is saying I'm going to buy when I wake up. Almost bought at $3050. Now it's too expensive again. I'll be content with my buys at $3250 and $3450
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:11:49
Can't wait. I'll start following your channel 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:09:55
Nah I was trying to be funny and must have missed the mark. lol

I panic bought my last shares at $67 now I'm not too upset about it 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:19:28
Was this your original video? I would like to see some more about running a full node and what that means in ELI5 mode 
@_date: 2017-07-15 04:04:10
Btw BTC is down about 100 points since I bought. So you're all welcome lol!
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:57:50
So once it forks how do I get my bitcoin cash or whatever the proper word is and sell it from my wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:56:02
I don't have a lot but just moved mine out of coinbase to bread
@_date: 2017-07-15 03:54:11
Thanks for all the great responses everyone! I'm starting to get the idea of this. Can I transfer my coin out of coinbase to breadwallet then?  I also bought some ETH the other day and not sure where to keep it. Is there an even better option than a wallet on my phone? And yes I have a pin on this phone now that I have some wallets. ��
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:48:23
I have no idea what you guys are talking about but I want to buy some bitcoin and transfer it to breadwallet. How the heck do I do that? I can also buy it directly from them for 1% fee. Thoughts?
