Actually, "argumentum ad hominem" is pretty close to Latin for "insult." 
It means directing your argument "to the man" or "to the person," in other words, attempting to weaken your opponent's argument by directing your critique to them as a person, rather than showing flaws in the logic they have put forth. 
Sure, there are nuanced ways you could put forth an ad hominem attack that was not very insulting, or maybe even flattering ("This woman is tan and beautiful, she can't know anything about Linux because she obviously hasn't spent much time in indoors in front of a computer.") 
But that is usually not the case, and is definitely not the case here.
If you'd like to make a case that the chart /w/witcoins posted was *not* an insult, I'd be curious to hear it.

The voting system is easy to manipulate. One person with 15 puppet accounts can easily upvote a comment to the top or downvote a comment to the bottom.

Nope, it isn't. If people start using it a lot I'll just hire an assistant in India to do it, and split the tips with them.

Great idea! I'll polish my logic chops and then try it out.

Definitely! I'll pitch in for the patent lawyer fees

That's a good idea, thanks. I've never used that feature on RES.
There is still the issue of trolls posting comments with false logic, which might look true to newbies. 
I still feel like posts with bad arguments should be corrected, not just ignored...
