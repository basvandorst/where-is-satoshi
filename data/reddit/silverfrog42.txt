Sorry about roger ver. I guess they just put him in the video because he is a bitcoin fanatic. He seems to generally have strong emotional overreactions to everything. Besides the Roger Ver part, I found the video interesting.

There is a massive amount of hype around cryptocurrencies right now, but while Bitcoin and other similar currencies are most likely a bubble blockchain technology, in general, is something that has a lot of potentials.

The blockchain is a technology that could have a lot of potentials. It is somewhat similar to the early internet. Not a lot of people understand it and it does seem a bit weird at times, but technology like this could provide a platform for massive innovation just like with the internet how companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon ended up providing massive innovations for many people. However, despite all of the potential in a technology like blockchain it could just be over-hyped and may not end up changing the world all that much. Blockchain overall is still quite risky, but I am personally very excited about it.

I have no idea what has been happening too the cryptocurrencies market lately. I mean I understand that its value is volatile, but this is just crazy.

There are many possible potentials of blockchain technology that are still yet to be explored. One example of this is dash currency. It is similar to bitcoin except the algorithm is designed to make transactions much faster. The risk of this technology is the same with any other new idea. It is almost like staring into an abyss. If you’ve ever seen the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies it looks like an unpredictable rollercoaster. Blockchain could possibly end up changing the world and giving birth to multi-billion companies, or it could just be and overhyped bubble.

Pretty much what I saw happening in my best brokers stock simulator account. I invested a ton of money in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, dash, litecoin, and neo. My entire account plotted over the past few months just looks like a large partially burst bubble. As you could probably guess I was not too happy to see this.

I like cryptocurrencies in general, however there still are a few problems with them. Such as the volatile value, and investment risk.

Bitcoin may be dying, but the blockchain will live on.

Sorry about having Roger Ver in the video. Besides that part though, I found the video interesting.
