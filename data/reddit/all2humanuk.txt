Well that's your first mistake putting you faith in one investment. You know whats a good investment long term? Mutual Funds. You know what's a safe investment long term? Treasury Bonds. There's nothing wrong with treating Bitcoin as an investment but I'd probably consider it much like people do precious metals where you only want to allocate a limited amount of your money to it.

This is complete nonsense firstly there had been a successful tulip trade in the Netherlands for decades before the mania so people knew where to get them. Secondly there was rarity, that's the whole point. People wanted very specific bulbs with a virus. That virus made the bulbs harder to propagate, hence scarcity.
If you are going to theorize on something at least know your subject or it makes your argument look weak.

So what's the alternative? How do I quickly and conveniently pay for my coffee and the vendor confirm my money's good? Genuine question.

Yeah I did. I was asking what the alternative was. You gave one which is less convenient and seems more like using BTC to pay for the novelty of it all. that is the reality if crypto is to really take off it needs to rival established alternatives in convenience and availability.

I'm not personally convinced with the argument for crypto currency in these smaller face to face transactions. Not when there's already the convenience of the things like Apple Pay and contactless payment cards.
