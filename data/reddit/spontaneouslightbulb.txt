Can you tell I used to implement eCommerce websites and credit card payment processors? lol

They're not covering fraud, they're covering the lower margin due to using the payment processor.

It's not abnormal to get upset when someone you don't respect is right about something, especially at your expense. Even if they're not "right right", semantically speaking, it still hurts. Hopefully it's not too bad on you and is just a learning experience, something teachable you'll share with your kids. It's possible the greatest contribution this has is not yet realized, kind of like how the dot com boom went.

A lot about how the author admits to trying to talk to Satoshi almost seems like harassment. I'm a huge supporter of Satoshi, and so glad he exists, but maybe he just wanted to be left in peace. He's not an active part of that world anymore, and maybe he chose to leave for personal reasons. He pulled his email from a provider of train parts, called all his family members, shows up at his house... I would have called the cops too.

I worked as a project manager at a software company that had a lot of delivery issues. Even I am surprised by Jordan's poor handling of the situation, he didn't seem to keep the stakeholders engaged with changing situations and the fact he'd not follow up with then after missing his already delayed delivery deadlines is just bad management. I wouldn't trust this guy with a single dollar.

I love the internet and how quickly we can all find out the twists and turns in every instance of history in the making.

Love the platform, but remember to try to represent yourself as you are. Don't make your platform, "I'm not that guy.... Who you've reelected for two decades,".

Being overly literal will not make what you want any more true or possible.
