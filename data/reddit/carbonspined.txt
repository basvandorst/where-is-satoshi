There is actually someone who has had that idea ;)

No...I was going to make an effort to make one, but the domain name was already taken...so this is not me. :)

If you think Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, you probably should get out of cryptos all together as we are all basically trading our money for something that has no tangible value, expecting it to be worth more in a few days, weeks, or months. All value generated by other people wanting the same thing...

Well...that doesn't make it a Ponzi, now does it? The fact is that the value of other coins is tightly tied to Bitcoin. I agree that, at the moment, Bitcoin is unusable as a real-world currency. But so would any of the forks and most alt-coins also be at the volume you need to be to be considered a currency you could use the way you use a fiat.

I don't freak out at all my friend. I have been holding my bitcoin since it was worth nothing, and will, most likely, continue to do so until it's worth nothing again.
The point I wanted to get across is that for crypto to be more than a niche in the future, we need Bitcoin to be strong. Not only for the sake of the small investors, but also for the other coins.

Indeed!! The Lightning network is one of the things that can right at least some of the problems Bitcoin is facing. 
Let's hope it's not too late to keep people investing and drive new innovation for the crypto market. We need a strong coin at the bottom of things...

Litecoin is indeed an interesting coin. I do have a little invested in it as I think it will gain some more traction next year. 
Another interesting project is IOTA, but they have some way to go still. 
The thing is...Bitcoin is usually the "base" of most coins out there at the moment. It needs to do well for the other coins to thrive. I wish it wasn't so, but right now it's a fact of life.

Indeed it is, and I believe I mentioned it in the original post as one of the reasons to why we need Bitcoin to be strong. 
This could be changed, and probably will be in the future, but there's really no coin that is suitable for the role as things fall now...

The issues with Bitcoin is real, but these are issues that most coins will face with the usage that Bitcoin has now. This is a problem none of the coins forked from Bitcoin will solve either. Granted...some of them will last longer but will hit a wall soon enough. None of them are ready to face regular use as a currency with the volume of transactions that entail.
There are however other coins that may have solved this...let's hope they get some traction soon...

Good answer!! 
I wish that more people cared about the tech behind the different coins. That's what got me interested in the first place. Sadly...most people are interested in fast profits over understanding the tech behind.
I agree that Bitcoin, and all of the other coins for that matter, resemble a Ponzi hence my reply to you above. This whole crypto market is based on the fact that you set a value to something that has no tangible value at all. Without anyone believing it has value, it's worthless, and vice versa. 
...and yes...other coins scale better than Bitcoin, but none of the current coins, with the exception of a couple very interesting projects, can cope with the TPS you would need to approach real-world use. IOTA has been on my radar for some time and seems very interesting in that regard.
I still, however, think that for the moment...we need Bitcoin as a base of the market. It's the coin everyone knows and trust. That counts for a lot when it comes to small investors.

I'm a happy user at Kraken, especially now that the site works a bit better, but I do tend to transfer out most of my coins as soon as possible. You never know...
