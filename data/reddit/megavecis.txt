Sending all 201BTC at once for tokens to stranger. For me it is hard to believe. But if it is true, what a valuable lesson!

Hell yeah if Iran adopts BTC, thus bypass all the sanctions imposed by imperial democratizators.

Fail, again. The state regulates that currently rich stays rich, by impossible regulations for fair competition. Remove regulation, and many will enter the market, providing same goods, but cheaper. 
Rich in 3 generation by default has become lazy, lack motivation, because they had it all form the begining. They will lose their capital, if there is no state...

Please remember that a day before Estonian CB, Lithuanian CB made exactly the same report/statement for bitcoin as possible Ponzi scheme. Russian CB also issued (27.01.13) hostile press release to bitcoin.  Let's wait when Latvian CB will make similar warning. Russia, Lithuania and Estonia all are neighbouring countries to Latvia.

Russell is maried in Rotshield family, has ties to current global elite. History shows that following these elitist types is really bloody and nasty thing. Should be tenfold suspicious of him. Advocates wealth redistribution and collectivist wet dreams.
p.s. his quote: profit is filthy word.

Thank you Satoshi, again. DNB got it good. Except criminals, but this argument will allways be reminded by our "protectors".

Corporation are possible only if state supports it. They are artiffical "too big to respond to market" organizatins, so they lobby and regulate market for themselves. 
Where there is regulation, there is no free market! The term Regulated free market is like Allmost pregnant.
P.S. BP spills are possible because by concept that oceans and seas is shouldn't be property. But property without owner, thus responsible for its management, is allways subject to squandering and trashing.

If there is no gun at your head, then how could anybody coerce people to buy one brand? Do you will go to mcdonalds and eat their cancer junk, if across the street is some chineese (anybody can offer more healthy cuisine) foods? And profit nicely. Even, if the price of one meal is double mcdonalds?

Corporations are a cartels. The state is required to enforce it. Temptation to break out of the cartel, drop prices, increase quality and take over huge market share, thus gain more than being in cartel. Without state corporations will dissolve in minutes. Guaranteed!!!
Here is proof. I live in the EU, 80km form the border of Russia. Gasoline here is about 1,3 EUR/1 litre. In Russia one liter costs 0.6 EUR. Remove borders and after few hours there will be russian gasoline in my backyard, delivered. Arbitrage, pirce equalization will happen. And no one will go to STATOIL or other gas station owned by corporation. And STATOIL may put out to local inhabitants any "law", rule or order. They will say **"STATOIL MY ASS! I BUY RUSSIAN"** 
P.S. 2 years ago there was plenty of merchants offering russian gasoline. Contraband you may say. But quality was superior comparing to "official" gasoline in tanks. Seriously!

Here, look for your self:

Russian rouble is backed by US dollar reserves. If Russian CB wants to issue more roubles, first they must buy toilet paper to "back it" propperly. So they has been screwd bigtime. All official talk about BTC as backing-free currency is display of ignorance and propoganda. Thats all!

why do you invent such unrealities? 


how Microsoft can take away somebodies freedom? Did they have a jail-houses? Funding personal police agency is fucking expensive - this adds to their product price and makes it less competitive.
