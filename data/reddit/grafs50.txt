Good luck getting that money back after they steal it.

This needs to be brought up against the Bitlicense.
@_date: 2014-06-22 08:35:56
Come on, now. You know this isn't good news. It just makes Bitcoin look like a vehicle for criminals. This will NOT help gain popular support. Definitely, it will cause the opposite if it becomes a media story.
@_date: 2014-08-28 22:09:14
This is a drawback, certainly.
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:43:15
I feel like this is sarcasm. But if you really heard this (very unlikely), where?
@_date: 2014-07-23 07:11:46
If this happens in New York it will end up happening basically anywhere. Let's be honest, in the financial system we have today, Bitcoin cannot be allowed to be unregulated if it becomes part of that system.

I seriously don't understand why this subreddit constantly links to all of these posts that don't even actually effect Bitcoin in anyway. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:10:34
Because the buying and selling will offset each other, not because the sending of bitcoins is done off market. Circle has to buy from someone or mine, just like everybody else. Im sure Coinbase also sells at least some of the Bitcoin it buys back from its users.
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:16:02
its coming back down quick though.

I must be missing some step. What prevents somone from sending a random hash that still meets the requirements? I think I understand how blocks are verified, but not why the verification "is" a verification. Say a correct hash of the block header is 002a4f, with two 0s being necessary to solve the hash. What would prevent someone from broadcasting the random characters 004ef3 as a valid hash? They both fit the requirement.
@_date: 2014-08-15 09:32:33
OP already said that this was meant sarcastically. But price volatility in something hoping to be a store of value is definitely not good.

After a certain amount of transactions all previous transactions are locked in aren't they? I thought after a certain number of either blocks found or confirmations the network would not accept even a longer chain to wipe it out?

Ya, this was it^. Thanks for correcting me.
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:32:02
Well Bitcoin was the original so it *was* the original. But the real differece between bitcoin and litecoin is the network effect. The reason that litecoin needs significantly quicker innovation than bitcoin is because litecoin is in constant, direct competition with all other altcoins for second place behind bitcoin. 
The network effect is bitcoin's advantage. litecoin doesn't have this, It needs to find a competitive advantage and quick if it wants to survive.

Why do you think the slow devaluing of fiat will cause a collapse of the system? if in 150+ years (it will take longer than this) bread is worth a $1,000, $1s will be treated as cents are today. We could have $1, $5, etc. coins like we have 1 and 5 cent coins now.

r/bitcoin is important for Bitcoin's future and should not be allowed to become a place for ads; which this borders on.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:35:04
OP, you're not thinking rationally. You're stuck in the hype and ideology of what you hope bitcoin can become. You need to realize how free markets work. People are NOT going to start buying bitcoin, at this stage, just to support an ideology, especially with a crashing price. Maybe that's how it worked in 2009, but the market is just too big today. 
If you want Bitcoin to succeed, you need to give people reasons to buy it. Not just tell people to stop panicking and artificially hold the price up. If that worked, we would never have a currency crisis.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:29:33
Overstock holds about 10% of the bitcoin that it recieves.

Except that this only holds true if every participant in the market has all relevant information, and that traders are always behaving rationally. Neither of these are even remotely true.

So I have seen some interest for having this image, posted as a previous thread, being put into a t-shirt. I know someone who runs a screen printing business that might be able to make a bunch of these - possibly even at a discounted price if there were enough of them. Right now I think the price is about $18 plus shipping (which I think is a flat rate of $3.50 but no promises. I'd be fine accepting bitcoin if there was a way to do easily do that.
EDIT: He'll ownly do the top part of the picture from "Bitcoin:" to the end of the formula. He doesn't want to offend anyone.
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:58:35
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:52:41
I'll see if they can do that. Can you please email virtfund so I can keep track of this?
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:50:31
I could get you one of these tshirts. I know a guy that runs a screen printing business. I think it would cost like $15-18 plus shipping. I'll make a post about it on here too.
