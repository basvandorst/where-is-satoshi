 Well, you could try buying bitcoins at CEX (r/ with your cards or even via bank transfers. But mind that the company provides its services not to all US states. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:24:31
 Why wouldn't you try CEX? It's a practical and convenient exchange where you can buy cryptos using debit/credit cards. By the way, the company has recently made a relaunch of the wires option and offers bonuses: r/ 
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:07:55
 Oh, thank you! Perhaps I'll follow your advice :) 
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:52:45
 Where are you from then? As far as I know, most countries from Europe are used for buying Bitcoin.

 If you wanna hold bitcoins you'd better buy a hardware wallet. Though it is quite expensive, at least it's more secure. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:29:58
Theoretically, if something like happened, you could withdraw your money by using CEX, as an option along with Binance and Coinbase. This company is based in the UK, by the way. And lately, they updated their wires and withdrawals are now available in USD, EUR, and GBP, r/ 
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:00:30
This is the case when the new replaces the old. While the price of gold is lowering, money is flowing into the crypto market which means that investors may consider cryptocurrencies more interesting than fiat money. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 13:33:23
 Try CEX for debit cards. They accept dollars, euros, British pounds, and even rubles. Also, the company has a wires option which is fully renewed: r/ 
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:40:10
 You may try using CEX (r/ You can purchase there btc or other coins using yours cards. And if you need a wallet, they provide one with cold storage. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:13:21
 Well, there are many exchanges where you can buy btc. For me the most convenient payment method is a credit card, so I’m using cex. You can check it too, r/   
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:05:52
 Besides, we should mind that bitcoin is independent from any country, which makes it something close to international currency. And, sure thing, it may be exchanged for other currency or certain goods, which makes digital money just as useful as common ones.   
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:30:38
 Why do you think it’s radical? If I'm not mistaking, buying and selling crypto through exchanges is online activity. And it’s quite usual thing.  
@_date: 2018-08-06 14:03:44
 I would recommend cex - r/ Their fees are quite reasonable and the website is really simple to use. Though, they require ID, so it might not fit to you. But to be honest, I think that since verification is needed in terms of security, it shouldn’t be a problem. Sure, your opinion may differ from my one.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:44:03

 It seems to me that sooner or later there will be a children's manual about bitcoins – titled “The Story of One Coin” or something like this. Then I can show it to my parents too ;)

 Which exchange has failed you? Sorry to hear that but we must admit that problems may occur at any time and with any business. Maybe it would be better choose another platform. For instance, cex (r/ I'm using it and haven't faced any serious issues yet. If you don’t like this exchange, you can make you own research and find the one that’ll fit you.

 It’s funny how modern governments and analysts react to the implementation of crypto. Traditional systems are afraid of new trends and crypto in particular. Countries like Venezuela and Iran try to find a new way of using cryptos instead of fiats. Btw, Switzerland do the same but calmly...

 You know, I've recently seen a website with a very useful tool. Cryptowisser if I'm not mistaking. It has a special filter which helps to select the exchange by choosing a certain characteristic. Try that, it might help.

 Very useful article. I think you should also pay attention on fees. Don’t they depend on a chosen payment method? Well, maybe you're providing us with info only about cc/dc transactions. Besides, this data may need some update, try to be more specific. The majority of exchanges charge comparably low fees for trading.

Regarding alts - think about ethereum, it’s still the second most popular. 
As for the exchanges - better find one with a friendly interface. I first started with cex.io, it seemed quite intuitive.

It's hard to tell for sure what the future may hold for BCH. For all the public doubts and uncertainties BCH is now supported by almost all exchanges and trading platforms. It stands a good chance to establish itself in the market and compete for the second leading position with ETH.

Well, you know it’s not really time to make final conclusions. However, it’s always time to be thankful to the developers. And I’m pretty sure that SegWit will eventually make the Bitcoin network more efficient.

What really helps is watching different videos on YouTube and googling. As for the news websites - coindesk, cointelegraph, bitcoinmagazine, cryptocoinsnews, cnbc... (probably these are the most popular)
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:18:02
Hardware wallet and a paper wallet (with a recovery phrase, or private address written on it) are undoubtedly the safest to keep your Bitcoins. In this case, they can’t be stolen by hackers through the internet and can’t be lost in case your hardware wallet is broken. You will still have a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:42:44
You said $4000 is the next stop. I think it won’t even be a stop but just another record point that Bitcoin will cross and continue  increasing. $5000 is a realistic price for Bitcoin in a short term.

There are NO perfect exchanges. The recommendations are always vague and subjective. Take any of the exchanges you mentioned and you will certainly find both positive and negative reviews. They all have clear advantages and disadvantages. The question is how these exchanges respond to these reviews and whether they are interested to somehow improve their services and interact with their customers. I do not intend to cover up for any of these exchanges, but I clearly see, who cares about the reputation:       
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:30:49
I've read somewhere about a man who threw away his hard drive with 7,000BTC in 2013 or so. I can't even imagine how he feels right now, when the price is $4000.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:25:15
You may know that Bitcoin has already hit the record of $4000. Currently, it’s about $4400. I have no doubts that 5k is the rate we are going to see very soon.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:18:22
I’m not really sure that bitcoin will hit $10k by the end of this year, but in a longer time. Still, I would be really glad if you’re right.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:50:50
 I think there are two different scenarios. There is some possibility, that Bitcoin will disappear as a whole, or it will replace existing money and other cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:21:41
 There are actually many places or ways you can get bitcoins. Take a look at that,  There's a comparison table for exchanges. Agree with the previous suggestions, but I would also mention [cex ]( I tried both coinbase and cex, and they are fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:55:30
It really makes sense. Given that we all know that Bitcoin will more probably grow. The price and market cap can reach insane heights by the time the reward halves.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:47:07
OMG. I can’t believe. I stumbled upon this video about two weeks ago and now I see this and can’t stop laughing. This is so true!
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:56:38
 It contains just some popular facts and quotes from well-known people who believe in a great bitcoin future, but there's also a sarcastic comment at the end and a misleading headline. No useful information, no proves nor analysis. The question for me remains whether it is irony or not. If not, I can’t imagine how those facts are able to encourage to invest in bitcoin. The effect is exactly the opposite. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:42:30
 If you want to buy, do it. Bitcoin has proved that it is not a bubble and it won’t disappear. Its price will definetely grow, and now is probably the perfect time to invest. If you've finally decided to buy, you should choose a place. The safest one is the exchange. There are plenty of them, and I would advise CEX. This platform allows you to easily buy crypto with fiat , plus, it's very convenient for beginners.   
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:44:58
 The main thing about cryptocurrencies is their unpredictability. The price may reach $250k by 2022 as well as $4k or less. The cycle from bearish to bullish market repeats, but neither patterns nor charts are capable to accurately predict the future, since the time frameworks and price range always change. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:14:43
 Currently, people use Bitcoin for speculative purposes and nobody, except for 8-10% of users, cares about its original intention. Only the price encourages people to buy Bitcoin, not the benefits it brings us. But the value of Bitcoin is not in price but in a principle of the fast exchange of money without intermediaries. When people will realize all the potential Bitcoin and blockchain have and benefits that they will bring to our lives, they will be more motivated. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:36:31
Coinbase is not only a wallet but the cryptocurrency exchange which provides a vault for storing digital coins. And it's said to be the best and advertised as an exchange.Actually, for purposes of storing it might be better to buy a hardware wallet like Trezor, KeepKey or Ledger Nano S. Additionally, you may register at the exchange like Coinbase mentioned above or CEX ( [https//:cex.io/]( ) offers cold storage for cryptocurrency funds. Offline storages are way more immune to hacker attacks.
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:06:35
 In fact, it's better to obtain a hardware wallet. It's more secure though rather expensive. Alternatively, you can look for the exchanges which provide a cold storage. One of them is CEX that allows buying coins with cards or via bank transfers. If you happen to have btc, you can get altcoins like zec with it . 
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:59:56
 Check out CEX. The withdrawal definitely takes less than 3 weeks there, it may vary, but usually, it's a matter of a few days. Furthermore, CEX offers reasonable fees. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:39:07
 Bitcoin.com is not namely for buying. If you want to buy Bitcoins, better use the crypto exchange. Check CEX as it is a trusted and reliable one. Create an account and verify your ID. You purchase BTC with USD or EUR there. The platform allows depositing with a credit card or via fee-free wire transfers. You can also take a look at Coinbase or Kraken. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:27:24
Agree, it seems to be about adoption. Guess crypto adoption into
real life globally is a new big challenge of 2018 for all Bitcoin and other coin enthusiasts, to 
move it all to the next level from being just something speculative to something worth thinking
and having.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:45:52
 I agree regarding resetting expectations. I also believe Segwit adoption and Lightning Network can provide a competitive environment for Bitcoin to remain its position of Number 1 crypto. Besides, the more popular Bitcoin gets in the long run, the better for all crypto currencies due to positive public image and better adoption in the society as consequences.

 His account was locked down rather than blocked. I think that Tweeter's attitude towards cryptocurrency scams is justified. Taking into consideration some fake accounts that have used Elon Musk's name for promoting crypto scams, there is nothing surprising.

 This is a new currency, which is digital, unlike our usual money. As some people says, it aimed to be used anonymously, without banks. But in fact, that's far from the truth. 
Here are some pieces for considering :   
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:56:37
 First off all I’m not sure that it’ll happen. But even in case it will, there is a solution. We'll just come back to using our centralized currencies as we do it in the present time. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:35:57
I think everyday people are able to decide by themselves if they need Bitcoin or not. But due to global interest in this phenomenon like cryptocurrency they will probably start using this in their everyday life as payment. Sooner or later.

 Well, if you think that Coinjoin, Schnorr, and even Dandelion is not enough, you may take a look at this -  I believe that deep research may help to find other methods of improving bitcoins privacy as well.

Have you seen this article on [Bitcoinexchangeguide]( ? And this one, on [Masterthecrypto]( ? If not, read them. Hope they will help you with your research. Talking about the particular topic, I think cryptocurrencies can be as an alternative to fiat money, or even will replace it in the distant future. In case they will become accepted globally without exception.  
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:37:22
 Lol. Yeap, sometimes it really feels like this. But I think that t's not as bad as it may look like. In my opinion we shouldn’t get into the public panic and keep on holding until it'll go to the moon. At least that’s what I do. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:56:14
Amazing idea. Great job taking the initiative and start reaching out to the common person and the day will def come when ppl start paying with crypto. Its just a matter of time. This is the exact kind of everyday help that the crypto world needs to get some legs under it and make it an everyday applicable currency.
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:18:01
I think the price is tied to exchange platforms, and as soon as they become more universal and first time user friendly, then we will see much more invested and the price rise. Its just too hard for lots of people to waste the time getting "verified" in order to invest. Much easier to open a bank deposit.....
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:56:26

Bitcoin can hardly be called a safe investment. Although it doesn’t mean that I am not going to invest in it. As a rule, if the risk is low so is the income. Investing in Bitcoin is risky although can be extremely profitable. Considering the lapse of 15 years… Well that’s a very long term for a crypto industry. Anything can happen. But I’m more likely to say yes to bitcoin investment than no.

 I never was in her shoes, but I think that I’d drive mad too. I really hate shady financial operations. Actually, transparent transactions system is the most valuable reason why I entered cryptoworld. Sometimes the banking system makes ordinary people vulnerable and helpless before banks.

 For me the most reliable place to purchase bitcoin is cex. The platform answers my expectation by all points. The established exchange has a high level of security and unlimited withdrawals. CEX is convenient for buying crypto and trading as well. The fees for depositing via credit card are agreeable, wire transfer deposit is fee-free. For newbies, it will be an ideal place due to the minimalistic and comprehensive interface. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:35:04
It depends on the location and regulations. In countries where bitcoin is a legal means of payment, you can buy almost anything with crypto. I’m not from the country that accepts bitcoin as a payment method so my list is quite limited. But it grows, and I believe that soon I’ll find more options.
