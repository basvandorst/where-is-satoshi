Thanks - the video is good but didn't address my question - my understanding is if two miners have the same transaction list, but order them differently in the tree, they are solving for a different merkle root.
Why do miners incorporate different transactions?  What governs the priority of transactions and the likelihood of inclusion in different blocks? If for example 100 transactions are evenly distributed over 10 minutes, why not solve for the first 10, starting at minute 1, and score a time advantage by starting earlier over other miners?

Great answer - thank you!  I forgot the coinbase transaction that rewards miners for their own effort. By definition therefore the Merkle root will be different even if the same transactions are being mined, and even if they were assembled in the same order in the Merkle tree.
Bitcoin days destroyed = thanks for explaining this - I was struggling to understand the significance of this stat given its presence on the charts list at blockchain.info - its use as an indicator of spam probability makes sense.
As to the algorithms that miners employ, I understand it's both (1) an optimisation problem: effort to compile and solve increasing number of transactions (largely determined by their byte size) vs the potential rewards on offer (the associated fees + coinbase) and (2) game theory given the competition between miners, their relative processing power etc.

Are transaction records ordered in a particular way in the Merkle tree by each miner, or is it random?

Is there any insight into what bitcoins are currently being used for today? I recognise that by definition transactions are pseudononymous so this is by design impossible to know for sure, but interested in any anecdotal views.
