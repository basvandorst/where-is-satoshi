Except there was no hack.  The celebs that had their icloud accounts compromised had terribly weak passwords.  Their accounts were compromised because of their poor choice of passwords.

Is this what mining is?  I thought that there were a certain number of hashes out there and mining was running values through an algorithm to determine what value matches what hash.  When you found a match you have now mined a bitcoin.  Am I completely wrong about this?

I get the concept of mining with a pool.  I think I'm not asking the question right.  If bitcoins are awarded based on people verifying transactions how are they awarded?
Does a system already have the list of values and randomly award them based on a random number generator?  I think the crux of my question is: where do the bitcoins come from if 'mining' is just verifying transactions.
Thanks for all the answers.

whats the lottery aspect?  can you explain in a bit more detail?

A second question.  Does this mean that once all bitcoins are given out (could be years but eventually they will be) that there will be no incentive to verify transactions since there's no possibility of be rewarded?

Thanks for the explanation.

Thank you for taking the time to write that.  It was really helpful.
