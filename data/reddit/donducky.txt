Well that's the whole reason for the all-in-one html page, so that there is no need to connect to the internet. If you generate the addresses online you can no longer say that these address have never touched the internet which is the whole purpose of offline cold storage. An attacker could hi-jack the bitaddress domain and inject his own code into your browser, possibly forcing you to to generate non-random keys that they could easily generate at a later date. It just removes every possible attack vector.

I can see the advantage of the instant transaction for first-time users where you could wait for your gateway to open your account while holding fiat, I can agree that's that good thing, thanks for your responses, it actually helped to clear up where ripple serves as a beneficial party in my mind. As a user already in trenched in the ecosystem its hard to see the benefit. Thank you. However in in practice I would find it really hard to explain to a new user how to use ripple in that fashion, I guess with time it could get easier. Thanks again.

A transaction may be safely sent without fees if these conditions are met:
- It is smaller than 10,000 bytes.
- All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
- Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below)
**Otherwise, the reference implementation will round up the transaction size to the next thousand bytes and add a fee of 0.1 mBTC (0.0001 BTC) per thousand bytes[1].** As an example, a fee of 0.1 mBTC (0.0001 BTC) would be added to a 746 byte transaction, and a fee of 0.2 mBTC (0.0002 BTC) would be added to a 1001 byte transaction. Users may increase the default 0.0001 BTC/kB fee setting, but cannot control transaction fees for each transaction. Bitcoin-Qt does prompt the user to accept the fee before the transaction is sent (they may cancel the transaction if they are not willing to pay the fee).
Note that a typical transaction is 500 bytes, so the typical transaction fee for low-priority transactions is 0.1 mBTC (0.0001 BTC), regardless of the number of bitcoins sent.

Early 2013, watched the price jump up to 256 and down to 100, I thought to myself "Holy shit, this thing has a pulse". I had heard of bitcoin before and saw a few videos on it here and there when it was $15 but didn't dig very deep and was turned off by negative comments on various websites. Immediately went into a research frenzy and had many sleepless nights catching up on all the latest developments and the nature of the whole system. Grabbed a couple coins at $100 and I'v been eating popcorn ever since. Also created 3 or 4 bitcoin web services since then which have been pretty good resume stuffers as a compsci student.

Bitpay and coinbase accept bitcoin transactions instantly, there is no wait-time. The difference in block times really mean nothing, it's considered impossible for the blockchain to be reversed for nearly an hour under the worst network conditions, same is true with other cryptos, all require 1 hour to be considered impossible to reverse, in most cases for smaller coins this is even longer, but since the hashrate of bitcoin is sooooo huge its really the most secure option in this regard. The block-times are an illusion.
They way in-which bitpay and coinbase accept instant transactions is really simple and requires knowledge of how a double-spend would likely occur. How they do this is they monitor the network and see what percentage of the network has seen that transaction. If 90% of the network sees that first transaction then its more likely that the network will accept that transaction, if a double spender tries to spend those coins twice, at-most 10% of the network will see that transaction and it becomes extremely unlikely that that transaction will make it into a block before the first one that reached 90% propagation across the network. It's a game of odds and it works quite well.

This post isn't having a go at people who have a large stake in bitcoin. I have no problem with that, the whole point is theorizing what satoshi did with his coins, not what any other people might do with theirs. This isn't a "hit piece" that you need to get all defensive about.

I completely agree with this assessment, wasn't trying to troll anyone here, but even in this future scenario there is no guarantee of a stable store of value or practical unit of account.

Well I would point you to this thread: 
If you received a 0.00006 payout 175 times you would have a grand total of 0.0105 btc which is far less than the OP of this post, so you could expect your balance to be eaten up very quickly by the transaction fee.
In theory you could receive payment from an address until it reaches a certain threshold and consolidate the balance and begin collecting from another address.
More on transaction fees here:

Doge isn't fueled by fiat exchange, it's crypto exchange. How is the marketcap calculated? You take the value of doge in bitcoin and convert bitcoin to dollars, that's how all the value is determined on coinmarketcap. There's near zero liquidity for doge and fiat. That doesn't mean the value can't go up in terms of bitcoin, doesn't negate my point, just means there was buying going on in during the dip of bitcoin.

Are you aware what is meant by the term turning complete? If you've actually looked at bitcoin's scripting language its extremely limited so that only a couple functions are permitted, m-of-n transactions and time-lock.

In the paper wallet tab it asks how many you want to generate, the default is 3 but you can put any number there. As far as bulk sending... that's a tough one,  individual scans would probably be required. Also, 500 satoshi's isn't enough for a bitcoin transaction fee, you would just be handing out useless paper. Like its 1/3 of a cent..... the paper its printed on is probably worth more
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:01:07
You would still need to go though all the AML/KYC and open accounts on gateways to get cash out of ripple, if anything it takes a very market-based and decentralized process and props up a central party as the sole proprietor of all market functions. I'm sure ripple has a say in who opens a gateway and can wield a lot of power over who can use their network. Just seems like a needless concentration of power. I could be wrong though.

You will end up with less bitcoin by mining rather than actually buying them. Mining is has such a LOW barrier to entry that its barely if at all profitable, and even then you would be better off just buying them straight up. As far as price goes look at bitcoinwisdom.com and name anything, ANYTHING at all and you can buy it will bitcoin, go ahead name something.

Avoid "free bitcoin" websites, its a huge waste of time, you receive unusable amounts of bitcoin. Transactions fees are determined by thier size in kb, and when you receive a whole bunch of tiny transactions it creates a higher transaction fee, often more than the balance if you use these "free" bitcoin sites. We call these tiny transactions dust and are pointless to collect.

Coinbase is not a true exchange so they add a premium (they're more like a store), and Mt.Gox has been having issues lately so you can't withdrawal bitcoin or fiat, they are basically a zombie exchange until the foreseeable future, therefore you should take their exchange rate with a grain of salt and look to Bitstamp or other exchanges for the "real" exchange rate of bitcoin.

I just meant that you have to treat coinbase like a store, it's not a traditional exchange where the buyers and sellers are individuals and exchange with each other. Coinbase is great for getting your initial bitcoin but if you want to trade go with Bitstamp.net, avoid mt.gox like the plague. If you actually want to withdrawal fiat money I would go with coinbase aswell or localbitcoins.com, but the real price action and liquidity is on traditional exchanges.

There are 2 main problems I can see with this proposal, both of which are inherited from the concept of an "idea guy":
1. Communication with a project leader who isn't a game developer is pretty much impossible. One who doesn't know which things are hard or relevant can't be head of a whole project.
2. Paying someone a percentage - while it might sound good on paper - is something noone worth their salt is gonna take up on. This is because out of all games that are completed and put on the market in any way, only a very small percentage actually generate anything more than 100$. 
If you have a solution to these problems I would be interested in hearing your idea.

That's what xrp is for I guess, you have fiat on an exchange, and you want to transfer that fiat to another exchange, you would first have to buy xrp? Otherwise it would just be printing dollars, because if an exchange credited fiat into ripple that cash would still be sitting at the old exchange and now there's twice as much fiat. In which case why not just use bitcoin.. lol

Although the blockchain size is growing every-day and is already quite large with it's current size at around 25GB, it is not required to download to use bitcoin, for example: I could generate a bitcoin address offline with just an [HTML page]( and store my bitcoins on that address, when I want to spend those coins I could use a service that runs a full bitcoin node such as blockchain.info, load my keys into their service and send bitcoin that way. There are plenty of other ways to use bitcoin without downloading all that data. In the future it's likely that only bitcoin services and users with lots of space space will run a full bitcoin node, and it will likley take a while to download, but for everyday consumers this is not required. So I feel pretty confident that bitcoin will still be here 6 weeks from now.

Yeah I'm aware, but it's no where near the liquidity of doge to bitcoin which was my point, markets don't stop if bitcoin dips. If people see doge as a good hedge it will see buying during dips, same thing happened to litecoin not to long ago, and asicminer shares. I like doge but declaring independence is a little too premature. I wasn't trying to be rude with my response, just wanted to point out the context of that percentage point, which would explain OP's query.

Although I don't personally use Multibit, I think I have a pretty good idea of how something like it would work. All the key generation is on your client side, meaning that they do not have access to your keys, thats all that really matters. What makes Multibit useful in the sense that you don't have to download the whole blockchain is that they relay your signed transaction. Signing a transaction is a mathematical process in which you would authorize the transaction you want to make with your private key. You can't reverse engineer a private key from a digital signature so it would be considered safe to forward it to the multibit servers where they would broadcast that transaction to the entire network. I hope that helps answer your question.

Worst case scenario people wait an hour or two, coinbase has some serious backing, they probably have a rigorous human protocol that are on-call 24/7 for this kind of scenario. At the hearings they mentioned that their in and out flow are nearly on par which helps medicate their coin flow issues.

Good idea, just a quick plug - I make a site that creates a generator automatically for any designs you have at: 
Unfortunately it only displays QR codes and not addresses in text, but should get the job done if that's what you're looking for. Just right-click on the resulting design, view source, and save as a .HTML file and voila  you have a custom generator.

I'm fine with satoshi, anything more adds too much abstraction which requires understanding of satoshi so its pretty redundant. As value rises these intermediary units become irrelevant. Just my opinion. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:13:25


Buy, mining will result in negative profit.


It will cost you more in electricity than the bitcoins you will produce.


Bitcoin and paypal do not mix, paypal is reversible, bitcoin is irreversible. Therefore people get scammed all the time trying to sell/buy bitcoin with paypal. Credit cards are reversible too so they don't work, you need to use a bank wire transfer or buy them with cash locally from people around you, see: localbitcoins.com


See sidebar ---&gt;


Yes they charge 0.5% per trade I believe, but don't use Mt.gox if you are in the USA, it will take months to withdraw your money, see more options to buy in the sidebar ---&gt;

Yes you just send it to the paper, when you want to spend you would import the private key into another client like blockchain.info 
The whole point of using a paper wallet is that the private keys have never touched the internet, so when you spend from your paper wallet it's best to send the "change" to a new paper wallet. Search this subreddit for the concept of "change addresses" and "paper wallets" there is plenty information out there.

Because there is no limit on how many cards they can produce, it is centrally controlled. Bitcoin is decentralized meaning no one has the power to create more than the pre-determined limit. Also you can't send pokemon cards over the internet instantly for basically nothing, and I don't think a single merchant is willing to to accept pokemon cards for goods/services, with bitcoin there are +20,000 merchants ready and willing to accept bitcoin with more and more coming online everyday.

Just make a new post, leave this one here, you might get a bite or two. But to be honest multi-sig transactions have been a highly requested feature for bitcoin for quite some time and I'm not sure there have been any results so far, thier might even be a larger bounty elsewhere but I'm not sure.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:25:12
I see what you mean by voting with your dollars for features, allowing donations to take a crucial part in the overall design of the system, that seems pretty complex but I like the idea. Hopefully we'll see something like it arise.

The whole point of using a paper wallet is that the private key has never touched the internet, once that private key has been imported into a client/blockchain.info, it's best to create a new paper wallet and send the change from you transaction there:
To understand change, see this post: 
Personally, I find bitcoin-qt too cumbersome for transactions, I like to use blockchain.info and import the private key into an account that has **2-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ENABLED**, always use 2FA for online sites, otherwise you WILL get hacked and whine about it here, just download the google authentication app, takes 5 seconds to setup.

@_date: 2013-11-10 01:21:13
I just want to point out that using bitcoin faucets or "free" bitcoin sites is a terrible idea, they will accumulate alot of tiny transactions that will add up to an absurd fee when trying to spend them (could be as high as 90% of the balance). This is called "collecting dust" which can end up with disappointing results if you spend a lot of time on these sites only to learn that you wasted your time entirely. I would recommend just buying them outright and dispersing them among the classroom.

This sounds like wishful thinking


Yeah, only one person is working on bitcoin, your right lets all pick-up and leave. In my opinion that's bitcoin's greatest strength that it is completely opensource and relies on voluntary contribution removing monetary incentive and allows it to stand on it's own merit and not the financial backing of biased parties.


There are lots of smart people working on finding solutions for this, and plenty of secure offline solutions exist today that seek to provide protection and convenience. At least with bitcoin there is a choice to be made freely by the user, can't say that much for ripple. I'm not a bitcoin core dev so don't expect the most articulate answer from some random on the reddit forum, this is just my opinion and nothing more.

All you should need is a debit card, also it won't work if you have a visa debit card.


Good job looking them up, they defiantly have some unsavory business practices, but they are the oldest Canadian exchange and have the most liquidity. However, I don't have an account with them due to thier strict requirements.


I have to agree with you there, but in bitcoin land it's not as easy as whipping out a card. Due to it's irreversible nature sellers need to be protected from charge-backs so that really limits your options. It sucks I know, but it should get better with time.


Also have to agree with you, us Canadians really don't have the greatest options. We used to have LibertyBit which was a godsend, email transfers for $2 and only took a day or so to clear, and no verification needed. God I miss them. Unfortunately they had to close down due to bank crap and charge-backs.

If you store coins on gox you deserve to have them stolen, if you don't have FA enabled then your a real retard.

Doesn't get easier than that.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:29:32
That's been my experience aswell, people love to spam armory and electrum here and it's mindboggling that you would expect people to be trained in top tier security practices right from the getgo, it's easy to lose sight of the simplicity of bitcoin which is really a tragedy imo.

And it's centrally controlled and has a microscopic community supporting it's development and growth compared to bitcoin. The centrally controlled part is it's biggest weakness, as they have premined billions of ripples and just give them to thier friends.

Have them set up a bitcoin wallet!
Paypal is reversible, same with credit cards, you will likely get scammed if you try to buy and sell with these platforms since bitcoin is irreversable.
You could also have them set up a merchant account with bitpay or coinbase so they can receive the fiat equivalent instantly (next day) into thier bank account if they don't want to hold bitcoins long term

With brain wallets this is already happening, people can generate addresses with a simple seed that can be recreated, so for example the addresses generate with the seed "hello world i am a brain wallet" with bitaddress.org would generate the following key pair:
public: 14dGhtdzPXHdeB6GRxEfntADscGZa1WuKC
private: 5JrGdqbUn8wN19GgYbrme4EddiWEifnDnr8oCvLc31QoWUarKi8
Which could be re-created by anyone.
So people are constantly generating addresses with these simple seeds and monitoring them for transactions. 
As for randomly generated addresses it's possible, but ridiculously unlikely if the addresses are truly generated randomly. To give you an idea of how many possible Bitcoin addresses there are, imagine a particle of flour. This particle represents 1 Bitcoin address. If you were to turn every possible Bitcoin address into a particle of flour, the flour would completely fill 225 Milky Way Galaxies.

- download the sourcecode from bitaddress.org (HTML file)
- convert you image to base64: 
- go to line 7537
- replace that big block of code with your base64 image data
- adjust the css values of the qr codes if need be (with an extension like firebug or something, you can also just use your brower by right-clicking and selecting "inspect element" )
- save your changes in the HTML code
