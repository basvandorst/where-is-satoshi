I use this on my Iphone.  I can now spend bitcoins anywhere with my iphone and it rocks.
I am not storing a lot of Bitcoin in my 37coins wallet.  Only about $50 worth.  I basically treat it like my real wallet-which also could be stolen with minimal investment and work.
I wonder what level of investment it would take to steal the coins from my 37coins wallet?  If it is possible, but basically costs about $100 or more to do it to any specific phone, then in general it is safe to keep less than $100 on it I think.  But if you can rob a phone for less than $10 a phone, then we have a problem.

I am setting up an Armory offline computer, but I have one concern.  After 6 months, the operating system on the offline computer will no longer have the latest security patches.  Do you plan on somehow updating it, or do you just assume, since it is offline and never on the Internet, it is secure enough and not vulnerable.  …This will get weirder and weirder as time goes on, an OS not updated for 2 years is very out of date…
What do you think?

I think the best thing we can do to encourage quality dialogue on bitcoin is to upvote and downvote AND use bitcoin to tip the highest quality posts and comments.  This has the added benefit of helping encourage participation we want and demonstrates the amazing power of bitcoin to do what dollars cannot do:  give money instantly in any amount to anyone anywhere for next to nothing.  So here:

Leo says, "I have 4 Bitcoins....Bitcoins are worth more than $100 each last time I checked."
Leo says an FBI spokesman has said they will sell DPR's bitcoins when the trial is over..."But they've shut down Mt.Gox so I don't know where they plan to do that at.  But anyway, they have to put Mt.Gox back online so they can get there money."

I only talk about Bitcoin if it comes up organically in conversation.  But...a coworker of mine was really interested.  I told her all about it.  A few weeks later, she wrote me a check and bought a bitcoin from me.  It was at $204...literally a day before this latest lift off.  She is not tech savvy.  I am giving it to her in a paper wallet.  Thats my story.
