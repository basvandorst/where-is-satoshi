It's not debt. It's literally just a clock, it showed the date and time
@_date: 2014-11-30 18:10:04
Can I use this on myself?
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:32:22
I mean for the most part. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:04:31
Oh, okay I guess maybe not then
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:14:39
Wait, I'm sorry, what are they doing? Figuring if Bitcoin is a proper means of payment?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:39:49
Fine, let's wait another year or two to get our money back. I don't know about you guys, but I don't have that kind of time.
@_date: 2014-01-24 12:29:42
What's that card?
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:55:18
I think its me. I'm bad luck. First I bought in the 900s, then it crashed. At 600 again, then it crashed. At 600 again the other day, and now this. Literally everytime I've bought, it's crashed. Sorry guys.

So is this ebay for bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:32:07
They've killed Bitcoin. If not them, then something to do with this has killed it. November Bitcoin hits $1,200, now it's at $487. I can't believe it.

I really don't understand this whole things with china and bitcoins. Do they like bitcoins? Do they not?
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:59:39
Will it generate a new wallet or something?
@_date: 2014-06-19 22:17:52
...I dont get it
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:13:13
So, when will eBay start accepting Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:10:04
Dear God no more selloffs please
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:37:03
Godam I'm oblivious 
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:27:54
Not a joke. Im completely serious.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:14:06
Nice man, real descriptive and informative. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:02:13
gotcha, thanks
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:59:52
Ah shit dude, thats awesome!
@_date: 2014-06-03 01:05:17
When does this go into effect?
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:24:29
I'm just surprised they talked about something other than Flight 307
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:50:16
Also, how can I set up a wallet where I will be able to access my private key?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:49:06
Oh I see. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:48:55
Ohhh, perfect. That's where I was confused. Measure in crypto not dollars. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:49:23
And how would I go about moving them off the website to my own wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-19 00:10:53
...How do you auction off money?
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:11:07
Aready tried them, but they want my bank account number :/
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:57:00
Uhh... what are these "Linden Dollars". How do I select to buy Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:30:23
*sigh* alright, I'll think about it. Still very hesitant though. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:55:04
hmmm, good idea.
