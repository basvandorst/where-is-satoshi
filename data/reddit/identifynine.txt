My thinking on the subject is driven by a few things: 
1. Though my home is in one of the most beautiful places on the planet, there is not much in the way of a local economy - one either drives 40 miles to a job in one of the 'big' towns (Homer, Soldotna); or one works a rotational job in the oilfields/fishing/etc. Because of this, real estate in the traditional sense moves slowly.
2. There are a lot of folks who were forward thinking about Bitcoin and either got in early or mined their way to fortune. Some of those folks might be interested in a lovely Alaskan retreat, and wouldn't think twice about exchanging 200 coins for it. I originally got in at $24, and do most sincerely wish I'd had the wherewithal to do so earlier/bigger.

Thanks! That's the sort of thing I'm looking for - though my home qualifies as 'luxury' in only the most abstract sense of the word, lol
Edit: Hmmm...seems somewhat stagnant, and I note that u/bitpremier last posted 2 months ago. Doesn't inspire much confidence, sadly.

Fair point. I figured I'd pay the closing costs with cash, but hadn't given a great deal of thought to it past that vague notion. Details, details...
You're in Soldotna? I don't know of anyone else, but there's probably somebody in the 40's who's been mining since the beginning, lol.

Actually he says right up front that he's from the future - this is obviously a true story.
