Of course the second I sell, the price goes up again. Figures.

I bought at 2700. Of course I'm gonna sell. OP probably did too.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:09:49
If my funds were infinite, I might have let my 2700 200 euro buy in there. I don't, however, so I sold, and will be putting the 175 euros I have left into bitcoin when it bottoms out and the price starts rising again.

No problem. I'm getting off this hellride. Maybe I'll buy again when it plateaus at &lt;1k in three months.

I bought in at 2750 this afternoon. I don't see this rising any time soon. I'd be better off selling and buying when it starts to pull itself back together. I missed the bubble because I was being cautious and I sold way too late because I was too cautious as well. Maybe I'll have some more luck next time.

Why is it so hard for some of the people on here to realize that
1. The majority of people see bitcoin as an investment
2. If their investment devalues, they lose money
3. If you hold onto it instead of selling at the start of the dip, and buy back when it starts to rebound, you'll have saved a SHITTON of money.
It's like some of you are taking this "buy high, sell low" advice seriously.

It just broke the 1800's on bitfinex. We're in for a wild ride. How fast can we go?
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:23:38
Oops, it just went below 2k and holding there :). Guess that was bullshit.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:15:52
I'm looking at the charts. Bitcoin isn't going to rise to 5000 in one tick. If it does, I guess I'm stupid. Maybe it will be 1000. Maybe even 500. Who knows? All I'm saying is that the price has been declining for the past two days after the peak was reached and it shows no signs of stopping.

Being the owner of this "service" is a pretty smart way (and the only one) to make money from bitcoin short term.

If they salivate at the very thought of extracting 25$ of "wealth" from me that's really sad. This is a game to me. A gamble, nothing more. If I lose it all, fine. I'm just going to try not to let that happen.

It's not like it went down two points, dude. If I had left my money in I would have lost over 30% of it by now. I made the right choice. Long term at 2700 or at &lt;1500 which it's heading for is a big difference.

I bought 50 EUR worth of BTC about two years ago to buy something, can't remember what. Blockchain says it was worth like 400 euros if I'd have held onto it. Until Bitcoin plateaus and stays the same price in USD exchanges for over five years I will never see it as anything but a short term bet / long term investment opportunity.

It's not about money? Yeah, okay. Pack it up people, this currency is not about money. I guess everyone who ever bought BTC was wrong.
