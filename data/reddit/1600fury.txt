Surely they will have no issues ����

I swear to God, every single 14 year old 'i got into crypto 9 months ago and think I'm OG now' think that Reddit account age has something to do with how old you are or are too dumb to realize that maybe (just maybe) it's possible to have alt accounts. 
Newsflash genius. I'm.90% sure that you got into crypto after me, I mine on a larger scale than you, and have multiple Reddit accounts that are older than yours.

Sure kid. You just spend all day pretending the Bitconnect affiliates aren't criminals because you are concerned for them ����
Now get in your racecar bed and take a nap. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:38:52
You realize coininstant (very close to your name) was a fairly high profile scam in the day. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:18:27
Personally selling a financial instrument without lincensing to act as a broker is a federal crime. This goes for affiliates, and ad-buyers as well. They are federally fucked. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:29:05
No. Being a whale is owning a lot of wealth. What you describe is market manipulation, and it's very much not legal at all. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:35:06
If you think Trevon lost money on Bitconnect you are pretty much legitimately retarded. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:12:03
Like Two weeks right? Cause it's been 'launch ready' and 'only waiting for SegWit' since 2015 if you were to believe the group's involved when they called for Core. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:10:38
How is this hard to understand? Take a wild guess how easy it is to charge back a crypto purchase?
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:08:56
Well, technically because the foundation went broke. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:35:45
Prognostications. Yeah, go away bitchboy. Anyone dumb enough to defend some retard that scammed his way to fame shouldn't be allowed to handle money. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:35:41
Making excuses for scammers makes you pathetic at best, and retarded for sure. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:32:47
Oh sweet retard. You really are scared that the poor friends and family you conned into Bitconnect are gonna land your dumb ass in prison aren't you..
Nothing guaranteed? Except the 40% interest that they stated in their terms of service and advertising?
Be sure to get your whole head in front of the shotgun scamcunt. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:19:33
Don't bother. This knuckle dragging tardburger is an affiliate kid trying to argue for the Bitconnect team cause he's scared. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:43:43
No. I'm using exactly what I did. Sold 90% between $14k-$20k because it's not super difficult to read a high volume candle pop. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:27:06
Don't bother. He's retarded and scared. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:23:54
No need. They already have it, and their affiliate list, with payouts etc. If you were even somewhat involved you will be fucked. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:33:12
The 13 year old Bitconnect affiliate defending him if nothing else. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:09:31
Oh God if you only knew. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:29:37
You are literally too dumb to even know how advertising works. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:04:08
Cause having the company that holds your money be anonymous and unaccounteable while wash trading and running a fractional reserve is great. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:37:13
Don't bother. Digi is one of the insiders, or just a scared affiliate trying to defend the human garbage behind Bitconnect. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:35:15
You might be mentally slow. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:20:20
He didn't lose his buy-in either. 100% paid by Bitconnect. My guess he made $800k, lost nothing and was paid an extra $500k by Bitconnect direct. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:31:02
No it's not. Just because people do it, doesn't mean it's legal. Market manipulation is a federal offense no matter what financial instrument it concerns. 
Bitcoin is taxeable, which means it's a financial instrument. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:34:06
Wanna buy a car? Ok, here is a bag full of shit. Ha ha ha. You idiot, you thought you would get a car just cause that's what I promised and the contract said. 
Retard. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:39:29
Ha ha. Blow it out your ass shillcunt. I'm gonna laugh my ass off when that wannabe gangster gets stabbed in prison..
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:34:21
"most people who trade lose money" is just an excuse used by people who lose money. Beating 51% of people isn't hard if you have some experience. 
Thanks fact that historically holding has proven financially beneficial also doesn't translate to it being so in the future. Something that seems lost on many. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:12:16
So... For now a picture of a computer? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:11:22
'not in your lifetime' uh... What?
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:29:07
No. They did that, and sold a financial instrument without a brokerage license. AND to make matters worse, they profited off that sale. So it's big boy prison for affiliates as well. 
Not to mention they are double fucked. Cause if they try to hide their connection, then they can't pay capital gains tax on their income. Making them liable for tax fraud. 
Sucks to be a scammer ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:34:21
I don't get it. Holding since $20k was obviously a terrible decision, what makes it a good idea?
