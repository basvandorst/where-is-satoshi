well my first transaction is at 35+ confirmations, second still at zero and the first came in about 3 hours ago and i sent out the second shortly after.
About when could i expect the second to go through?

thanks a lot!

alright thanks for your help
What fee would you recommend for the future?

this is ridiculous, I'll email but I'm at 0 confirmations after nearly NINE HOURS

can you give me a real eta please? Over 6 hours now since i received a payment and it's still @ 0 confirmations, its not the first time this has happened either so im thinking about switching

Thanks but it says transaction is not likely to ever confirm. My fee is 122 Sat/b while your site estimates 7 days to confirm for 128 Sat/b so should I just expect it to take a little more than 7 days or significantly longer?

Classic. If you could help me with that that would be great

Actually I don't need it. Thanks for your site though. Its really well made and designed and of course does what it's supported to do.

I could do a cpfp, know any sites where I can do it easily?
