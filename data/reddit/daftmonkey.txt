I just can't understand how anyone can possibly take anything these guys say seriously. The only thing Jamie Dimon and co are authorities at is making money for themselves. And their track record, quite frankly, is mixed. Lord knows if I had an endless supply of free money and the Fed backstopping me, I'd probably be able to make some money too. It defies belief that they even bother to make these statements. Just shut the fuck up and try not to crash our economy again you fucking spoiled idiots.

I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone would ever take market analysis from a major bank seriously. We've seen repeatedly that THEIR traders don't take it seriously. They have every incentive to actively misrepresent their internal position to maximize internal profits, as they did during the financial crisis.

I think Al Gore's been a pretty good advocate for Global Warming, wouldn't you say? But thanks for choosing to respond to my comment from a maximally obnoxious obtuse point of view.

You get that just because they say something in an email to a developer, doesn't mean it's true, right? Apple has regional filtering. They could turn it off in regions where it's overtly illegal. They do this with plenty of other apps. I'm not going to find a citation. They're making this decision for strategic reasons so as not to rock the boat, which is certainly their right. My whole point was that we should see if we could help persuade them to loosen up.

If YouTube had given the government time to regulate web video, the web would be a very strange place covered with MPAA red tape. Instead, when Congress finally got around to creating regulations, YouTube was so entrenched that they had to more or less bless it. The same will be true here. If real companies like Google and Apple bless bitcoin, the government will follow their lead.

I dunno. What if 200,000 people signed a petition? It would certainly bring the issue to the fore, no?

i'm not going to pretend to be some sort of investing wiz. but the principle is buy low, sell high. If the market keeps oscillating between 800 and 1000, I plan to buy everytime it gets to 800, and sell above a thousand. It's just gambling. But it seems for the moment like these wild swings in price are fairly predictable...

I'll spin it for you. I'm not sure any of this is good news for the bitcoin community, but it's good news for investors. I sold at $1200 and i'm planning on buying back at like 300 next week.

I don't think you got my point. All they need to do is NOT ban Bitcoin apps in their app store. There are plenty of bad things that happen to their customers as a result of things in their app store. Fat people are having easier access to food. Single people are having easier access to herpes. WTF?

A. I can think of plenty of reasons for the worlds largest consumer electronics company to support a transformative international currency.
B. My point was that WE collectively need to be advocates for Bitcoin. I don't think Apple currently believes supporting Bitcoin is in their interest, which is why I asked: "What can we do to convince Apple to allow Bitcoin apps in the App Store?"

As a late-to-the-party Bitcoin enthusiast and investor, I'm terrified that Ron Paul might become the face of Bitcoin. Sure, he has a handful of interesting ideas and he's been a powerful advocate for them. But he also has a bunch of insane beliefs. And he's Rand Paul's father. We need a statesman like Al Gore or Warren Buffett.
