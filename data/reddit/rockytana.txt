You have buys in at $16,000, so you haven’t bought anything yet, correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:05:36
This isn’t going to end well
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:42:26
I could easily be wrong, I’m just repeating what I’ve read from a few traders I follow that due very well at hitting their projections. 
Upside was $24,000 on a slow crawl if we could break out above $20,000, but that’s got beat back, Bear downside is just above $15,000 and that seems to be coming into motion. 
The bears are going to win sometimes, it’s not that big of a deal, BTC is still worth a shit ton, but buying up at these prices, well the risk is just so so high. 
This guy is good, like really good, don’t k ow how he does it, but I bought ETH at $370 because of him. He hits his numbers. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:52:32
Totally agree, the change in this sub in the last 6 months is staggering, they scream of USD and gains. 
No one talks about Bcash ripping bitcoin in two, no one talks of the lighting network or what the kind of change means to the blockchain. 
I loved the tech, now I think it’s a passing fade, it’s truly sad, Bitcoin needs to loose 50% of its value and settle for a year, shake out this bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:16:45
Are any of the exchanges in compliance with these new rules?
If not, what do they have to be?
Can they still operate until they comply? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:24:31
You’re exactly right, it blows my mind that people except this as the new normal, the miners are holding everyone hostage, I sold off my BTC reserves and moved into ETH, LTC, I’m sick of the drama and in fighting with BTC, it’s sad, the worst thing to happen to BTC was gaining value. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:38:28
It’s still fucked, this market is a joke, it’s crashing all the time now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:31
Ha, autocorrect hates jokes
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:53
Seems it, this is one hell of a day, hang on fellas. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:38:56
I know, it sucks and it’s why BTC is really screwed in the long run, have you tried boosting it? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:09:07
Ok, well you can’t exactly be excited about what’s going on with the network, can you?
That’s my main issue with BTC, if we can just call it an asset and doesn’t really need to be moved quickly or cheaply, then sure, it’s fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:07:12
True, but this is now starting to happen more often, $57,000,000 last month, it means these wallets are now big targets for hackers, it could be Coinbase next time. 
You can’t just deny anything that isn’t positive about bitcoin, it’s foolish. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:05:14
You’re investing in a Tech, you need to research both and see what tech you want to back. It’s really what it comes down too. 
BTC is a religion at this point, you’re not going to get the answers you want here or on BTC. 
Research both BTC &amp; BCH, throw in some ETH, LTC as well, understand what you’re buying into, that’s the best advice I can give you. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:53:10
I don’t see how you’re wrong, but no regulations, so it’s all fair game, big fish eat the little fish. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:09
It’s not trading, it’s just sitting there
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:14:11
You should scroll the book down a little, there’s hundreds of buy orders just below that, it’s not even 2-1 at this point.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:19:51
Ugh, no thanks, I won’t be trying to guess that market play. 
 
It’s ETH for me, I’m house money in BTC, if I lose it, so be it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:05:15
Don’t think so, SK is trading at higher rates then we out by a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:09:18
They’re banning banks from trading or holding crypto, not banning crypto, did you read it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:04:33
I really hope this is a joke. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:05:52
SK must really think war is going to break out. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:44:54
Sounds like you’re trying to convince yourself, of that. Market is stable now, it’s not going to have quick climbs like that, futures markets made bitcoin more normal, then anything else. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:34:32
You’d cash out for fiat? The thing BTC is going to replace, this makes no sense at all.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:38:07
Only the USD is, not the coins, do your research 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:53
Because it’s supposed to be a currency, come on!!!
People want to buy stuff, they need to be able to move it around, my god.

Ah, long time holder, then yes, congrats on that, one of the few. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:48:55
So you don’t go to jail and have all of your money taken away from you. 
They’re looking for people just like you at the moment, look what’s going on with Coinbase, also, nice work posting this question on the fucking internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:15:02
This is about the best advice you’ll get from a stranger on the internet.

Well, the herd isn’t coming. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:51:15
My guess is she sent a low transaction fee, so it’s going to take a while, keep an eye on it. 
You’ve haven’t lost the coin, don’t worry about that, it just might take hours or days. 
Welcome to the scaling fight. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:23:28
First off, this is total bullshit, no one answers the phone at Coinbase, good try. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:53:05
Crickets 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:57:44
OMG, someone who actually understands what’s going on and explained it, I’m I really still in r/bitcoin!??
Perfectly said, BTC network is almost useless at this point, it’s an asset class now. It can’t be currency it doesn’t have the Tx speed, they’d have to change the entire tech at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:54:58
This was profit taking, not much more. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:02:54
This is very troubling, anyone calling it FUD, is just trying to calm their own nerves. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:36:30
This whole thing reminds me of the Pokémon Go craze, OMG this is the best thing ever! 
This will last for ever, eh it’s pretty good, well I don’t play as much anymore, oh yea that was fun, what’s Pokémon go? 
But with a far worse downside.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:16:53
It sucks, it really does, but they are growing at a rate they never thought would happen, yes they blew it with the lack of support staff and they know it. 
They put out a release about how they’re trying to catch up and have hired more people, does that fix it, no, but they’re are trying, I guess. 
They will get to you, it’s just going to take longer then you like, this happened to me, took them weeks to respond. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:56:10
Right? Also, Coinbase didn’t force anybody to buy or sell BCH last night, the sub is full of cry babies, No rules in the crypto world, a lot a kids learned a lesson last night, greed doesn’t get you anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:48:46
The network isn’t doing so hot, if you’ve failed to notice. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:30:38
You can’t insider trade in a unregulated market, it’s just trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:52:18
Have .25 I paid $500 for, left over from the 1.70 I sold during the attack a couple months ago, I was in to deep, had like $9,000 invested, stress was to much, I sold off, held a little. 
Sure I should have bought back in a while ago, but my .25 for $500 is jamming along. So, it could be a hell of a lot worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:33:46
In it for the fiat, I see, was never about the tech, was it? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:32:44
That’s what I’ve always thought, just seems like the base fees are pretty high at this point, if you want your coin moved in a timely manner, thanks for the input. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:00:11
And USA to start cracking down on them, this isn’t a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:45:22
This was from last night, I meant more, don’t count your chickens before the hatch, I don’t have a clue what will happen, my guess all along had been, stabilized, then a pull back, because it won’t be as sexy. 
But who the hell knows, I’m investing mostly in ALTS now, BTC is overpriced to have the crazy gains.   
I really don’t have a clue what you’re on about, I’m not OP. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:50:01
If they short it, then yes, it very well could be. 
But no one knows, spooky stuff.

GDAX 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:21:38
Agreed, if they open at all at this point, they’ve held it so long it’s all sells now, they had a chance at a balanced launch and blew it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:59:17
And you took the bait! How’s it going?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:37:13
Yes, no, maybe 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:41:29
Well, how do you define a correction? 
We’d have to agree on a % I guess, but it’s not a simple bet. 
Relax 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:35:05
That’s what I’m saying, they’re moving a lot of fiat into bitcoin, because they might have get the hell out of town, fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:37:37
It’s going to start happening more and more, governments don’t like their money going places they can’t trace it.

Looking at it now, there’s about 1900 buy orders between $4329&amp;4320
With 2,500 sells at $4330, the buys are gaining support, I don’t know if it will clear the book or not. 
But the sell orders have slowed and the buys are gaining for now. 
Geez, what a thing to watch, I sold my BTC yesterday and moved into ETH LTC, I needed a breather.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:04:36
Oh wow, ok here we go. 
What I was referring to was a bet between to people on the fucking internet, not shorting BTC or the futures market.  
My god, you really must have nothing going on in your life, do you? 
It was a quick comment on a Reddit thread, that you now think is the word of god, no one was saying anything about playing futures. 
I just didn’t want to get into deciding what a “correction” would have to be, that’s all, geez, chill out, don’t take your shitty day out on me. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:11:05

@_date: 2017-12-02 01:16:12
There is, but it’s mostly just you, screaming at your computer screen. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:03
You can’t judge anything right now, no liquidity in the BCH market, people are just finding out they released the coins, it’s a wild time. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:21:52
At least 3 days, could be 2 weeks, BTC Tx are trash at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:15:35
Should it could and would a much easier way to buy off someone like that. 
It’s actually a really good idea to do it that way.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:23:30
Yes, I’d think that’s safe to say.

It would take forever to get the money deposited. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:39:45
But this market defies all logic, but I really feel it stabilizes things more. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:21:38
Fair enough, that’s what I try to get people to talk about on here, no one seems to want to address any issues with the network, that it can’t be a currency at this point. 
A storage of wealth, sure, speculative investment, absolutely. 
If you ever want to talk ATL coins, DM me, been messing around in those, it’s fun, they’re cheap and the upsides are hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:08:22

@_date: 2017-12-19 17:44:37
The roof alone would be $8000-$11,000, the fence could be $8,000 at least, my god, what a terrible offer. 
Plus another $5,000 for the yard, then $3,000-$5000 for the paint, this is easily a $25,000 bid. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:28:23
R/Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:44:41
Seems like that and Korean War worries, if you were to see peace talks or any backing down of the threat, you’ll see a sell off. 
The US SK exercises will wrap up soon and it will cool off or all hell will break loose and you’ll have a shit load dead people, it’s a real drag. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:06:33
That’s what it’s worth now. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:13:49
Sure, keep telling your self that, this is trying to get around American sanctions
The USA isn’t going to like this.

Ha! And I probably still own more coin then you, that’s the funny part. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:55:01
Man, this is going to get ugly when a real selloff happens, people have no idea what they’re involved in. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:58:30
You’re clearly young, BTC would have to be worth millions for someone to retire off it, the average person at 65 would need two million dollars to retire. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:12:22
Thank you!! It also seems everyone just learned that BTC is an unregulated market as well, so much crying.

@_date: 2017-12-06 17:18:53
This seems fishy, it’s a big pump before the futures market opens on the 10th, they could easily be setting up a major short play on this. 
 
There no logic left in this market anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:19:35

How could this ever happen, you have to set there for hours for it to be confirmed or pay more for the transfer fee then the Big Mac. 
BTC isn’t a currency anymore, it’s an asset. 
Also, what kind of monster puts catsup on a Big Mac? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:00:32
What happens when this market turns bear, that’s what it means, it’s all well and good now, but it won’t last forever, they never do. 
All I see is people on here, telling everyone it’s will never end, are they saying it for others or for them selves? 
Everyone’s so nervous

Ripple, it’s the only one fastest enough to not big down, BTC will never be used by amazon, unless you were to hold your coins in a amazon wallet or exchange. It’s just to slow of a transfer otherwise.

The futures market stabilizing things has been the thought for a while, it seems to be true, at the moment. 
But it’s only been a few days, I’m sure you’ve got scared money that’s worried about a short play, then you’ve got people thinking this could be a top for a while, so they’re taking profits on any little surge up. 
You also have the Alt coins going off, people selling BTC and moving to ETH, LTC, it’s cheap with big up side and much less risk, so that’s an attractive place to invest at the moment. 
People don’t know how to play the BTC market at the moment, you’ve never had to deal with a futures market before, there’s going to be a learning curve for a little while.  
Also you have SK taking a long hard look the market right now, they’re going to release news on how they want to deal with it on Friday, from what I understand, so I’d think people are in a wait and see pattern at the moment as well.

Well, if Wall Street has bought up a shit ton of BTC, over the past week or so, to drive up the price, then puts in their shorts on Sunday, then dumps all their BTC at once to crash the market, yes it will affect the price. 
And there’s no one to stop them from doing it over and over again.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:18:07

Because it was announced last week and we’ve all moved on.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:50:16
So, at this point you don’t feel Bitcoin will be mass adopted and fiat will win out? 
Not saying you’re wrong at all for doing so, but you seem to be a long time holder, so I’m interested in your thoughts on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:11
For sure, I’m just looking at what there’s to look at right now, that’s about it.

That’s what I’m saying, they’re moving a lot of fiat into bitcoin, because they might have get the hell out of town, fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:31:20
Don’t know if it could even then, but people aren’t buying it for that use anymore, it’s more of an asset class at this point, it seems. 
I’m late to the bitcoin game, most are at this point unless you’ve got money to burn, that’s what worries me most about all this. 
It will be taken over by big money shortly, it really feels. 
The futures market isn’t a good thing for BTC, i don’t see how it could, Wall Street was never part of the equation here. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:29:33
They can do that, nothing you can do
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:06:15

You can’t compare the stock market to a currency, you know better then that. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:33:54
Little pop, then it will stabilize, I feel, Wall Street want freak out and cause big swings like normal people do, I think it cools things and people get bored, start to pull out and it becomes more of a stabile to bear market.

Now think of what this guy said, in a few years 1 BTC would be enough to retire off of, it would hav to be worth, what? 5 million at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:36:33
Not likely going to change anytime soon, the network is being spammed it seems to keep fees high. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:07:21
Nice, we just got a VidaMix blender, just up our smoothie game. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:13:24
Sooooo, no response? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:11:42
Still costs the same to mine, with more reward and more traction’s, the fees should be aiming down, not going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:00
I’m speaking more of what it would look like to the public, if you had a major hack of an exchange like that. 
Imagine is Bank of America was hacked and $60,000,000 million was stolen from peoples accounts, it would be major major news.
You can’t just shake off over a 100,000,000 million in coin stolen in the past money or so, it’s a big problem. 
Convince is everting now as days, online banking rules the roost, if you want bitcoin to be a currency it has to be easy to use, now you have two major hacks close together, it’s not good for crypto as a whole, it shows that it’s not a safe, easy way to use money. 
That’s all, it’s concerning and to think it’s FUD is foolish, you’re going to get a giant hack of a shit ton of coin, it’s going to happen, there’s to much money there not for it too.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:32:50
Well, then it should just cancel out, you can’t confirm something that is real. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:43:36
Ha, 90% of this sub has no clue about the tech. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:55:35
Do you have everything you have in BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:06:09
Fair enough 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:56:17
It’s the BCH Vs BTC battle that’s about to take place on Coinbase, get your popcorn. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:17:15
$40 is a low fee!?!
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:31:09
But they’re both slower then ETH and LTC, why bet against them?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:01:17
Ok, I will bite. 
If you’re trying to get a hold of Coinbase, you should email, tweet them and post in r/Coinbase 
They’re backed up for weeks with costumer service issues, they will get you, but it’s going to take much longer then you’ll want, that’s just how it is right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:07
Well done, thanks for a well informed comment, it’s rare on here. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:29:39
Eh, BCH is now worth 25% of BTC, that whole, Bcash is going to die today thing, that didn’t work out. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:55:56
What could go wrong, right? 
Sweet throwaway account
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:27:27
Interesting, thanks for the info, I’ve stepped away from things a bit, so much flying around, it’s rather dizzying. 
So BTC is making another push with this, I’d imagine.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:36:38
Bullshit post, traders from SK have been saying it’s due to the war threat, nice emoji 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:21:30
If it was a confirmed address, unless the person sends them back, because they’re a nice person, they’re gone, there’s nothing you can do.

Yes,no,maybe

Question, are you a realtor? 
Have you ever bought or sold real estate on this level? 
If not, I am and have been for the past 7 years, there’s no “website” that will help you. 
If he wants to sell  his holdings, you list what you’re willing to except as tender, finding a buyer with BTC is pretty tough. 
I don’t see the point of only taking BTC, when you can just buy BTC with fiat after sale. 
You won’t avoid taxes by taking BTC, I’m not sure what you’re advising him on here. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:41
Got yea, from what I understood it goes live an hour after the books opened. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:01:38
I believe that’s a personal insurance policy, not FDIC insured, from what I understand, but I guess the main issue is, neither of us know for sure?
I just don’t trust those exchanges at all, that’s why I’m not surprised by any of this, it seems foolish too. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:12:28
Ah, got yea, well I thought that’s what we were discussing. 
What did you make your living in? Seems like you’re new to BTC on Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:25:10
And everybody else, exchanges are a big old bullseye. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:10
To think any of these exchanges are established or trusting is foolish, no one forced anybody to buy or sell BCH on that launch last night, in fact, it would be foolish to react to a surprise launch of a new coin by buying or selling it. 
You didn’t have to do anything, anyone that bought or sold last night did so by their own free will, this market has no regulations, you’re swimming in open water with sharks. 
All of this stuff is New and you’re going to run into shady things, what exactly did Coinbase do to you, if you bought or sold, you did so of your own free will, you panicked, the exact thing you’re not supposed to do in the bitcoin market.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:42:35
This will be called FUD, but it’s so far from that, people are blind with greed. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:44:23
I believe there was something posted yesterday that showed this is exactly what they’re doing. 
Why wouldn’t you? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:16:14
It’s just not anywhere close to being a currency, they keep saying the tech will update, but it never does. 
ETH is a better tech with faster scaling and more coins, so people could actually own them and use them. 
The scaling issue for BTC is major, 5 transactions a second? 
That’s just a joke, I’m not pumping ETH I’m just pointing out the truth, I don’t ETH will be mass adopted, I how it does, because I have 5 coins there. 
I had 1.75 BTC then the attack from a few weeks ago showed me exactly how shitty the network was, slowed to a snails pace with ease, imagine if you had paid real bills with BTC during that time? You’d been fucked, then you’ve got the people on here screaming about the price in USD, you know, the exact thing bitcoin was designed to ruin, the irony in that is next level. 
This is a speculation bubble, it might work out, it might not, I have my .25 BTC I paid $500 bucks for and I’m happy to see what return I get out of it, but that’s about it, money ruins everything, BTC isn’t about changing the world anymore, it’s about the price it is in fiat. 
I can go on, but you get my point, BTC will never be a mass currency, the HODL crowd has insured that, but creating a false shortage of coins, if they fucking used BTC like it was supposed to be used, it would move around freely and have shot at really hurting fiat. 
But no, they want to prove everyone wrong and show how smart they’re by blindly holding it, while destroying the concept of BTC at the same time.     
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:47:37
Just keep making those miners rich, great advice 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:48:04
In it for the fiat
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:26:18
Must be
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:04:12
This is hilarious 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:32:21
It’s always been said they own around 1% of the coins out there, it’s based that being true, it’s a write up, not much more. 
Also, they wouldn’t be anything, until they sold it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:47:10
You’re a brave man, time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:20:58
Sorry, yes 1%
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:39:54
No way, that can’t be right, it’s to easy to buy it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:52
180,000 in the meme pool, you’re going to be waiting days. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:15:44
It blows me away at home many people cry about BCH, Ver is a salesmen, he’s selling his product, if you love BTC so much, then sell it!! 
I don’t have any BCH, just FYI. 
Oh Coinbase did this, oh Coinbase did that!! Coinbase didn’t do anything, if you sold, it’s your fault, if you bought BCH at $8000, it’s your fault, nobody else’s.   
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:42
HA! By the way, I’m famous for stuff like this, ask any of my friends.

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:28:36
Check the blockchain and see if it’s there, you’ll have a better understanding of why it showed up, if it’s there, someone sent it by mistake, that would be crazy. 
If it’s not there, it’s a bug and it will correct or you should report it. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:27:00
Ah, so charts don’t mean anything anymore, keep pumping it, what could go wrong? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:22:52
Fair enough, I was more towards the, you can’t really do anything with bitcoin side of it, you just own numbers and data. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:21:31
How can you believe in BTC as a tech, it’s so slow and the Tx fees are high, it’s like investing in Beta when VHS came out. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:07:53
Limit buys and sells on GDAX, no fees either
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:16
When do they plan on it going live? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:09:08
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:12:23
What shill, he posted the Tx, it shows the fee and confirmation, if anything you’re the shill trying to hide facts. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:44:37
Well said!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:38
You can’t cancel it, if he really just did this, those BTC are gone, unless you have the nicest person in the world on the other end, that will return it to the sender. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:35:12
That’s what I’m saying, they’re moving a lot of fiat into bitcoin, because they might have get the hell out of town, fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:47
He has some very good points, I’m don’t understand why people are sticking their heads in the sand about all this, you can’t move BTC around without it taking a long time and costing a lot. 
Lighting isn’t going to take care of this issue like people think, it’s also costly and takes time to set up. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:05:35
Yea, she sent the base fee, it’s stuck in the meme pool, it’s going to take a while to confirm, you’ll just have to wait. 
It sucks, BTC is costly to transfer now. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:01:56
Miss read the article, it’s says backing bitcoin as gold, my mistake. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:43:12
It hit a double top, it’s not a good sign. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:08:14
BCH will go down in price, it seems, as of now, in about 53 mins the sell bottom will be opened and then the show really begins. 
Please correct me if I’m wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:14:32
Ha, you only report it if you sell it for fiat, if you sell it for fiat, you’re going against bitcoin anyway. 
Good job on advising people to commit a felony
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:55:45
They want to corner the world market, if they see value in something they move on it, imagine you’re a retailer and you can design a currency or store a currency for your customer base, they use it to buy things from you and you get to store it for them as well, it’s every retailers dream. 
Think about it, you can charge a small transfer fee if people use the coin somewhere else, while not charging one, when you buy with amazon. 
It’s perfect, you get a to paid if someone shops somewhere else, while giving an incentive to shop with you, the more I write this, the more I can’t believe they haven’t done this yet. 
That’s why they’d get in the game, no reason for them not, amazon wants to be the go too online mega store.   
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:42:41
No, not at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:22:57
What’s the bet, $20,000 in ten days or less? You can’t really bet a correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:19:12
Nothing, if he thinks it’s going to happen, he just said, but I think you get a big pullback in BTC, down to a $15,000, but that’s still an amazingly high price. 
Watching all the new accounts get upset over this post is pretty telling. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:59:40
Yea, that’s as close as you’re going to get, not much You can buy with BTC, it’s all changed to fiat during the transaction, it’s BTC’s dirty little secret. 
It’s why I think BTC is funny money, an asset at best.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:01:13
Thanks for your insightful input l, so your thoughts are transfer fees are just out of control and this is how it’s going to be or you just feel like not helping this guy out? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:19:20
Yep, all the government need to do in the US to send BTC into the dumpster, is link it to ISIS, by by mass adoption, they soundly even need to outlaw it.
It so foolish to think, that the US government is going to allow something like this to threaten the USD, a simple, it’s not legal tender, you can’t expect law, will crush the market.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:20:40
This is troubling, they’re starting to rumble about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:12:45
What’s your address, so I can mail you some. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:31:44
No problem, it takes 7-10 days for the BTC to hit your account, you should have an email with the estimated date. 
Nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:19:02
Ah, the truth has been spoken!!
I agree, so bitcoin is what now, an asset?

I’m not saying he’s wrong or right, I just want something to support what he posts, that’s all
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:21:47
Nothing, miners are trying to prove a point here, they’re mining BCH, the meme pool have 141,000 in it, it’s going to be a while before it settles back down, about 24 hours or so, from what I’ve been reading. 
Hang tight, we are at crossroads here. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:18:34
This!!! A millions times, this!!
A bubble has to have mass investment, meaning the majority of investors have to be invested in it, Bitcoin isn’t anywhere near that, during the tech boom, everyone who had stocks, owned tech stock, that’s not the case with bitcoin, we are in the beginning stages of people coming into this market. 
Great post OP, thank you! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:23:21
You got it, if the Chinese jump to BCH, that’s it, it’s pretty much over, BCH will me the new “bitcoin”

@_date: 2017-11-08 22:57:45
Don’t think it breaks $7,000, it bounced off that hard last time, I really think it rally’s off this news

@_date: 2017-11-26 17:01:55
Oh yea, it’s something alright, that I wish I never found out about, I’m terrible with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:03:49
Just broke $6000, hold onto your shorts, free fall coming, floor was $5515ish last night, that’s my play here. 
But I’m just a guy on Reddit 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:22:23
Just wondering, was it based on any charts or reasoning or did you just expect it? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:30:18
It’s something to keep an eye on, but it’s not a problem at the moment. 
90,000, then I’d think something it up
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:30:29
No, the other side of the world is 5:30am, they’re awake. 
I don’t see this dipping below $7,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:50:37
No no, I haven’t bought any, you’re fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:04:59
But they aren’t users, they’re holding it, so it’s an asset, not what it’s designed for. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:23:17
You’re not wrong, little fuckers. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:31:47
140,000 in the meme pool, you’re stuck in the middle of an attack, just hang on, your coins are safe, don’t worry about that. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:40:28
Has to bet set in amount you want to buy of BTC, can’t do it in fiat, at least I can’t find a way too. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:48:08
Yea, this is madness.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:27:36
Not fall off the face of the earth and have Bitcoin cash become the new “bitcoin” 
Bounce off what ever price it is at that point 
Rally to back some of its lost gains 
Just not fucking die 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:01:34
What did you do, what type of transaction? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:09:20
It bounced from just above a $1000 to around $1450 90 mins or so ago, that’s a big pop, check the inter day chart. 
My comment was from an hour ago. 
When that started BTC dropped a couple hundred or more and hasn’t really be able to hold above $6500, it’s just a way to watch the women flow in and out of the two coins at the moment.

If you control your private keys, you will have the same amount of each coin, after the fork, even if it’s off line, any coins recorded on the blockchain before the fork will be matched. 
Your statement is 100% incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:47:02
I have no idea, but it seems like it’s starting up again. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:08:33
It had a 6% dip last night 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:59:08
I’m with you, I think we end up around $7,400, it’s strong up that way now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:57:10
You’re right, it’s crazy. 
None of this makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:47:55
$6,900 seems to be the wall at the moment, I also said, if 
But, Gt, you’ve thought this about it for weeks, I’m not saying it’s going to skyrocket. 
I said if it holds here and moves back to $7300-$7500 you’ve got a good idea that people want in below $7,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:11:16
Yes, I️ was reading up on that, seems like a good idea, then the bolckchain because a safety net, it has to be done, this is a total nightmare at this point. 
Why would anyone use BTC to send money to people, we need a Vinmo for BTC or it never becomes a real currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:36:54
It’s trading pretty well at the moment, next wall is $7,250, if it breaks that again, keep an eye on it. Could get a bump. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:21:55
But it’s not a bubble?
Be careful out there. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:06:30
No, not at all, I think you’re 100% right, history repeats it’s self, but I think this is going to be a nasty retelling of the story. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:46:28
How do we know he hasn’t!?!
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:48:29

@_date: 2017-11-10 15:38:12
WHAT!?!? No way, doesn’t it get canceled after 72 hours?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:20:26
Hopefully the Lighting network clears this all up, but you’re correct, Bitcoin isn’t a currency, it’s an asset. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:43:49
I have no fucking clue, who’s doing all the buying!?!?

Oh no, I wish I could swing this market like that, people were posting some panic statements last night is All and I was bored as hell, so I felt like chatting, never thought the post would get so much attention to be honest.
I think this price gives people a better window to buy in here, if we get a bounce back up soon, I think it shows a healthy market, with real support levels. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:34:10
Well, I’m not trading it for anything, it was designed to used to purchase goods and services, was it not? 
So, if you can’t use it do that, then it’s an asset class, your USD to yuan point is incorrect. 
BTC was designed to be used, not to be held as an asset, if I️ go to China, I️ trade in my USD for Yuan, not because I️ want to hold it, because I️ want to buy food or gifts or whatever. 
This is the same concept behind bitcoin, a currency to be used in a digital market place or a brick and mortar one. 
It’s fine to hold it, but if you do, then that’s an asset and only an asset, but you’re doing the opposite of what bitcoin was designed to do.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:01:04
My biggest issue with the buyers now are, they don’t care about the tech or what bitcoin was designed to do. 
They want to get rich quick and cash out for fiat. 
Everyone cheering what BTC is worth in USD is next level ironic, they’re actually cheering the exact thing that bitcoin was developed to destroy. 
If bitcoin is worth $1,000,000, but you can’t buy much of anything with it, then bitcoin has failed as a tech and became something it was never supposed to be. 
People are cheering Wall Street trading bitcoin futures, WTF!?! 
Bitcoin was supposed to destroy Wall Street, not embrace them. 
What’s even worse is, most of the people reading this comment, won’t understand what I mean. 
And if you do understand, I clearly didn’t me you.     
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:01:59
But .25 at 7,700, meh it’s fine, if I thought 7,700 was anywhere near the top, I wouldn’t have even tried to buy today.

No, maybe 20% 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:57:01
You’re not wrong and I’m not right, I just think this attack put a bad taste in people’s mouth about the tech, I know it did for me. 
Forget the prices, BTC is tech and it just got its pants pulled down and it’s ass exposed. 
That’s what my worry is, it’s a big problem with the tech and that’s what I really care about.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:27:12
No, the issue is, if they want it to be used as a currency, it can’t work like this, I️’m moving 1.5 BTC, $9 bucks is fine, but if I’m trying to buy a cup of coffee, because that’s what people do with currency, they buy things, $9 is a major fucking problem. 
It’s not a fucking asset, it’s a currency, why is that so hard to see?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:09:35
It’s not really that bad right now, it popped up, now around $7,200, I think we end the day in the $7,300-$7,400 range. 
If you wanted to sell, $7,800 would have been the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:08:25
You know what else is kinda worry sum, what are these people going to do with all that coin once it gets moved?
They’re most likely moving it to sell and it could get even uglier, but you’re right, I sold off All but .24 of mine, because the tech sucks at this point.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:41:10

The safe play is 10% of your investments, spread amongst BTC, ETH and LTE. 
I’m not an advisor, but its a buy and hold play, best way to put it is, invest what you’re will to lose.  
 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:02:20
No, incorrect, in a way
You can do a instant purchase with a debit card, the fees are higher in that, but your purchase limit is much lower. 
Sounds like you used your bank account OP, fees are lower but you have to wait to get your coin. 
Everything is perfectly normal for your purchase, just keep an eye on your email to make sure it doesn’t get canceled for some reason. 
Yes, that can happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:15:19
Don’t tease me

Oh man, that haircut. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:15:42
It’s not about the tech anymore, it’s about what it’s worth in fiat dollars, you know, exactly what bitcoin is trying to replace. 
Smh 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:03:56
Most people don’t like to take risk, risk is scary and you can get hurt, they want someone telling them what to do and how to invest their money, it makes them feel safe, it makes them feel that someone’s looking out for them.
But most of these people aren’t being looked out for at all, just become someone is rich, doesn’t make them smart, people are very set in their ways.
The gold standard is just that, it’s the standard, it’s been around for as long as they can remember and it seems to work for them, so why question it, it’s safe, they think they understand it and why rock the boat. 
What amazes me is how quick people went back to trusting the banks, they about ended this country’s economy and the worlds for that matter. 
They wanted to kill Wall Street and their big money banker friends, this was only 8-9 years ago. Americans have a very short memory, we are the goldfish of the first world. 
How could they question the guy on TV, telling them that Bitcoin is bad and a bubble, why would he say such a thing, well, maybe it’s because it’s the biggest threat to his industry and his big money Wall Street pals, that’s come along? 
 
People hear and see what they want too, most don’t question or challenge the hire ups, do to the risk of what could happen to them. 
So it comes back to that word “risk” and how much you’re willing to handle, I hope with the press BTC is getting, it will give people more access to the correct information about the blockchain and what BTC is, I believe in a digital currency, it’s easier to track and it’s not stuffed away somewhere in a place I can’t go and see it ( Fort Knots). 
Information is key to all of this, the more information, the more people can decide for them selves. 
Sorry for the rant.     
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:07:13
Still out for me and has been for a little while, not good. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:12:16
True and it went to $1100 and popped, then it was followed by years of a bear market. 
A bubble doesn’t mean the death of something, it means it overvalued with scared money, BTC isn’t going to die, I’m not saying that. 
But it’s too heavy at the moment and could have a major correction to a bear market, just like it’s done many times before. 
I hope it does well for you, just read up on what you’re cheering about, that’s all. 
Knowledge is power. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:06:20
Eh, depends on how you feel, do you think it dips after the fork? 
Why would you think that it will, why would that think that it wouldn’t? 
Do you want to be in on the sell or all in on the hodl? 
Do you want to sell some and hodl some? 
How do you want to protect your self, personally, I’d be pretty surprised if we had a dip before the fork, let alone this far out, but that’s just my logic. 
The one thing you want to do is make a well thought out decision and not a panicked or reactive one.
 I kinda feel this is the dip off the high of $7450. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:14:28
Well, that’s a bullshit headline. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:36:41
01-2014, it’s very far from New, I’m not saying it’s not out there, but do your research. 
It’s very far from being mainstream, it’s a good thing if you want to invest, but it’s also a bad thing, because it might never be. 
Are we having fun yet!?! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:38:49
That’s your choice, it’s what tech you believe in, I think both stink at the moment.

Right? BTC would swings hundreds in a matter of mins just a couple months ago, now if it doesn’t hit a ATH every two hours, it’s a dip. 
I’m worried these people are going to learn about the crypto market, that hard way, very soon.   
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:39:42
Well, China can’t really trade anymore, can they? 
I was thinking Korea and Japan.

I don’t disagree, I listen to both sides, if someone makes the long suggestion, I ask why and what they have to support that as well, I’d love to be a MOD for this sub, I just want research based comments or disclaimers on someone prediction. 
But this guy’s comment was really out of left field, like there was nothing to support that a pull back was starting, minus that it wasn’t sitting at the all time high, that’s all I was saying, I wanted to know why he thought it. 
It’s a different market now, CoinBase has added sooooo many new accounts, those people can’t even buy yet, think about that, any dip is going to be bought up and fast, people want in, and the gains at the moment don’t support anyone new, selling. 
The old holders, sure, but if they sell, it’s going to be bought up fast, it’s a supply and demand rally , as well as other things. 
That’s numbers based, that’s why I think this hit $10,000.   
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:06:22
Not you, was referring to the comment that a $150 billion dollar market can’t be messed you. 
Saying something is foolish is hardly a personal attack.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:21:03
Well, it can be easily slowed to a snails pace, it relies on miners, who are out for profits, it takes massive amounts of energy to mine, you can’t use it to buy goods or services because of the transfer cost and time of transfer. 
I keep hearing it’s being worked on, but it’s not, then I hear about the lighting network, well that’s cool, but it takes the transactions off the blockchain, so it’s not what BTC is all about. 
Its got a long way to come and it’s seems like no one seems to understand that.     
It’s become a religion at this point, not a tech, people are blind to its flaws, someone is going to bring out a coin, that fixes all these issues and that will take over at some point. 
21,000,000 BTC hurts it, you can’t go global with it, there’s not enough of it to go around. 
It’s an asset at this point, not a currency. 
Lite coin is a much better product, but no one seems to care. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:28:58
Did you get into BTC to make a $1000, if so, sell. If not, then buy or just hodl, it’s hard to guess this market. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:37:36
The support at $8000 is so big at the moment, that’s the level to look at, if it drops below that, then you could see a selloff to the $7200-$7400 range. 
Otherwise I wouldn’t pay much attention if it stays above $8000 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:03:56
Huh, that’s one I️ haven’t heard yet, Time will tell
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:55:34
There’s a very good chance that it will stabilize the bitcoin market, you won’t get the big swings anymore. 
Google it, you’ll see some good writes ups on the matter. 
Real traders will come into the market, they don’t react like normal people do, you’ll get a better idea of where bitcoin price is headed, so the wings won’t happen anymore.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:34:11
People say a lot of stuff, people buy at highs all the time, hang on, I️ bought my first .50 at $4700, China news broke two days later, dropped to $3,000 in a few days.
I️ bought all the way down, I️ now have 1.73 BTC, I️ just lost 9% of my holdings in 24 hours, you have to know that BTC is the most volatile market there is, OP isnt trying to sell BTC, he’s just saying we’ve all been here before, that’s all. 
Hang in, it’s a dip in the road for now, welcome to the market.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:27:54

It’s worrisome, what do you think the “truth” is? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:34:33
It’s hard to say, I believe it’s more of a power grab then anything else, I do feel that bitcoin needs to have more transactions per min, to become a really form of currency, but highjacking the code and letting the minors take over, isn’t the way to do it. 
This is a great read on scaling and what’s going on with the fork. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:49

Because the market wasn’t driven by that, it’s a solid investment with CME opening a futures market. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:32:29
It’s a different market now, you have different type of investors in BTC now, day trading has changed as well, really money, with smart people are in this now. 
BTC isn’t going to lose 90% if it’s value just because it has before. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:34:58

Oh I know, I’m just pointing out a lot new people are getting a taste of a crazy market for the first time, now they can’t sell because GDAX just crashed, another great sign for bitcoin. But that’s another thread. 
Today is going to be crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:21:30
Sure, because bitcoin just became something totally different and is now only to go up forever.

@_date: 2017-11-11 01:01:56
What’s your thoughts on it?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:27:47
Maybe hedge your bet, half now, then wait till after the fork, being all in on either side is the biggest risk, investment is risk, it’s figuring out how to lower the risk that’s the key. 
We can’t predict the future, so all I can see is, a little now and a little later. 
But that’s 100% your call and what the fuck do I know.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:16:28
In the short term, depends on much money you’ve got to play with, in the long term, who the fuck knows? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:35:30
Well, I hope you have a lot of BTC, for all those kids 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:31:09
Eh, it’s a fun idea, but I don’t think most of them could have bought in so fast. 
But it’s as good a reason as any for it to go up, it’s defying logic. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:15:16
Got ya, was a little confused. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:41:58

The fees aren’t great, but if you’re worried about them to much, you don’t really think BTC will move much at all, do you?

Oh I see, anything factual against bitcoin is FUD, I get it, you’re a gone down with the ship, ok, I respect that. 
I like to understand what’s going on with a market and why 140,000 transactions are stuck in the meme pool, when a group of people and an entire country of miners are trying to crash a network. 
So, if that’s FUD, then yes I was screaming about it. 
I think of FUD as opinions and lies, not what is actually happening before my eyes. 
Agree to disagree? Also, I don’t want BCH to take over the show, but I also don’t want to watch all these newcomers get their asses handed to them and not understand why.  
My god, 170,000 in the meme pool now! 
Not even the large fees are getting confirmed, this is so shady. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:38:34
Is dropping back down to $5700 not bearish? 
I’ve got buys in at that price, I just don’t see a breakout here, because BCH just started a pop and BTC is below $6400 and lowering.

The arrows all point to a bubble, at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:48:35
We had a correction of 7%, that’s a pretty healthy correction, it dropped off of an ATH and is now floating around 6% off that high. 
This is what a correction is, a steady down off of a high. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:29:58

Hahahah, but I’m not sure if you’re kidding. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:15:06
It’s not crazy at all, it’s a basic inside job, with zero down side for them.

You guys aren’t going to like the futures market. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:20:48
Well, it seems that way, I don’t know for sure, I can do is look at what’s happening, it’s back to higher then it was 2 days ago, even yesterday morning and the news is everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:44:05
7-10 days, check your email, it will give you the date
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:26:49
Nice, I’m currently stuck in the ducking meme pool, because $5 on a transfer isn’t enough it seems. 
So you think this is the support level?  
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:08:17
I’d be frustrated too if I sold at $5,000, I get it, just don’t try to influence others, you’ve got to much emotion in it, it’s dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:05:18
There’s no way in the world they could know this
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:50:58
Interesting, I didn’t know that, never traded fiat 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:33:34
It’s says they’re going to do it anyway, on the site, been posted a few times here as well, I️ have no idea wtf is happening at this point, some say it’s trolling, some say it’s a rouge miner doing the spilt anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:21:09
Thank for the tip, didn’t know about this one, paid $4 more dollars, will let you know how it goes, even if you don’t care. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:23:43
Thanks! I will check it out. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:59:37
Totally agree, but that seems to be shoved to side on this sub, it’s about profits and price now.
Just pointing out that BTC feels more like an asset, then ever before. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:41:38
This is the dip and it’s currently at the higher end of the last couple days. 
Might be on the move back up, sell wall is moving. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:19:57
They have been developing  their own tech around the blockchain, they never hated the tech, they hate bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:36:23
Ha!!! Love it 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:22:16
I totally get it, I just think it’s funny, the irony of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:44:37
Is investing in gold, a Ponzi scheme? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:07:52
Maybe hash rate is more favorable for BCH, again. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:00:36
This is real, this is a real attack on bitcoin and it’s working, you should be protecting your self, but you bought before the fork, I’m sure, so why would you give a shit? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:10:33
Well, they’re reporting on a something that’s been going around in the community, it’s not just a few, it’s being talked about a lot. 
I’m not saying you’re wrong, but a lot of people are very new to this market and don’t know it’s ugly past. 
I think making people aware of something that could go wrong isn’t such a bad thing, That exchange has been having some major issues lately, the exchanges are making the most money out of all of this and could just close over night, I don’t think most people are aware of that. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:26:20
I’m not sure if they have, but you can see how the price reacts based on the amount of google searches  for Bitcoin, that’s been pretty interesting to watch. 
I firmly believe Bitcoin is just being exposed to the masses, with that, comes more confidante investors, talking about BTC, at some point bitcoin will be a must have for any portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:32:19
This isn’t a good sign at all, this is text book single of a bubble. 
Faster gains at a higher price is not good news. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:16:41
Well, I’d hope you’d be able to trust this person, if you feel you can’t be fully honest with them, I think that’s the bigger issue, not if they know you own BTC. 
What would be the downside of them knowing, it seems to be a large part of your holdings, if you were to lie and they advise you do something with that money, not knowing where it really is coming from, you could be put in major tax trouble, by no fault of theirs. 
Be honest, you need to trust this person, fully, if you don’t, find someone you do. 
That’s just my 0.000002
Congrats, it’s a good problem to have. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:34:48
It’s not a hard thing to do, you can buy I BTC right now, I don’t get why this is a thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:40:50
Fair enough, I stand corrected. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:57:56
Higher gains at higher prices isn’t a good sign for this type of market, you should read up on bubbles. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:37:58
When you have to make statements that something isn’t a bubble, it’s not a good sign.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:54:47
It seems the market cares
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:08:40
Yep, I’d be buying at $3000 as well, the sell wall at $10,000 is massive. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:28:27
Of what? An asset? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:38:39
True, it’s hard to say, but if I had too, I’d be surprised with a major dip anytime before the fork, it’s already moved around $600 if it’s high set last nice and has pushed back above $7,000 for now. 
I think you’ll see more money coming in before the fork, so you could see $8,000 plus, on the high high side, $10,000. 
CoinBase just added 100,000 new accounts in the last 24 hours, those people didn’t join to sell, they joined to buy and they can’t even do it yet.
That’s my 2 cents, if works, I’m a genius, if it doesn’t, what do I know, I’m just some dude on reddit. 
But I’ve made my money over the past few months by hodling and buying the dips, I have 1.5 BTC with my total invest of $6,600 and I’m not selling.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:57:09
Do what’s best for you, this is just Information, just use your eyes, $5500 is the new wall, if it gets smashed, $5000 is a real thing. 
Good luck and happy trading.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:14:28
Really, that’s it? My god, my insurance agent has 21,000 stuck in a trust, what’s that make him? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:42:12
Wow, that’s it, I ask you for the reason why you think something and that’s all you got? 
Also, I really hope English isn’t your first langue, because that comment is a shit show. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:13:56
What date was the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:10:17
Seems it, what a fucking mess
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:06:06
That’s the million dollar question, I’m not the person to answer that, to where I feel safe telling you. 
Google private keys and the wallet you use, should be a video on how to do so, it’s how I learned. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:55:08
Exactly, speculation buying, what’s happening right now is the definition of a bubble.
Bigger gains at higher prices, more people think it’s undervalued now, then did when it was worth $2000. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:24:59
I don’t think you’re wrong, I think it’s become an asset now, uncle Dick will sell his for fiat, he doesn’t think he will buy things with it at some point. 
Money has changed bitcoin, it’s not a currency, no one will spend it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:53:14
Money spoils things, it’s just the way it is, the only reason any one cares about BTC at the moment, is it worth in USD, people buying it because people say it will be worth X amount in how ever many years. 
Not because of the tech, nothing about bitcoin has changed, it’s still the same thing as it was when it was worth $600 a year ago, the only thing that’s changed is the money it’s worth. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:54:06
If bitcoin doesn’t rally off that in 16 hours, BCH is the new king and BTC is dead, like for real dead, because now one will be mining it. 
Not bead, because people think it won’t work, dead, like really dead. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:24:06
Good point, but they’ll work something out, they own so much, you could use it at Whole Foods, it would be buying into their company. 
I’m more pointing out, that amazon has zero incentive to use BTC, there’s not enough of it to go around. 
Also, how would you price things with it, the market price moves so quickly, you’d have to write code to just keep up with the pricing of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:29:21
Look at the buy wall at $7,000, it’s already off it’s lows, if you want in before the fork, no seems like the time. 
Or it’s not. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:37:33
Sounds like to small of a fee, will take a few days to confirm, most likely. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:38:23

God, I feel sorry for the poor soul that has to try and explain bitcoin and the blockchain, to Trump. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:38:30
Oh I see, you just hate BCH, so you’re blinded but that, well, it’s still holding around $1,500, good thing you advised everyone to dump it before it crashed 
Hope you didn’t cost a lot of people a shit ton of money. 
But you have your own agenda, I get it, we all do. 
And anyone who listened to me yesterday selling around this price and picking back up at $5500, did pretty well for them selves
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:33:45
True, we understand that, but the average person doesn’t, we’ve been programmed to follow the heard, you have very smart people, working very hard to keep the masses from questioning anything. 
A population the questions is next to impossible to control, so, you have have advertising set to make you feel like you don’t have enough and you’re not good enough, they defund public schools, make college to costly for most to get a higher education, the poor are made to think that joining the army is the only way out. 
This isn’t by mistake, this how the powerful keep power, they can’t have the populace, happy, educated, healthy and wealthy, because then they’d start asking questions about, what the fuck the leadership of this country is actually up too. 
If you’re to worried about ISIS in the bushes or how you’re going to make rent, you’re sure as hell not going to have time to look into banking institutions, politics or fiat money. 
We are up against a finely tuned machine, that programmed to keep us consuming and not questioning. Because stepping out of line is considered taboo or wrong, how dare you question or challenge anything, because most are to afraid to do so, so they sure as hell don’t like it when you do. 
Sorry for the “ tin foil hat “ stuff, but it’s true and I’m just a guy on reddit. 
Question what you don’t think feels right, it’s that simple.   
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:51:37
Poor timing with this comment 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:17:15
I’m just asking, it’s so up in the air as to what it is, it’s private currency or asset. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:18:01
Yea. That’s the amount in the pool, you can look at how many low fee transactions, if they’re really high, it’s a good indicator there’s a spam attack. 
Last weekend the poop was much higher then this, 150,000 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:25:42
Hey, no problem, I’m just not in the Amazon BTC boat. 
There’s no reason for them to do it.

And here comes the panic, dropped $800 in mins, people that don’t know this market are going to start to wet the bed. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:41:53
Didn’t break $8000, weekend is coming, banks are closed, profit taking. 
And it’s overvalued 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:39:55
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:21:30
Because the tech is fucked and the fees are high, But yet people are pumping up the price?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:33:10
There’s nothing there
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:11:14
One goes up the other goes down, it seems. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:46:24
It’s crazy!!! I just wanted to chat, more then anything. I like the banter, keeps me from doing dumb stuff.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:49:07
That’s is the miners return, China moving over to BCH would kill Bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:24:54
But BTC has gotten closer to BCH, it was over 3 earlier today, maybe you had a smaller switch over and that’s why is slowing some. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:37:10
Some say it will stabilize the market, others say lower it, a few say raise it. 
I think a little pop, then a pull back to a stable market price. 
But I do think it cools off the bulls. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:57:20
Going well so far......
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:39:35
It’s got more stable money in it, but it’s been swinging a lot of the past few days, so I’m not exactly sure what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:22:40
Not a bad stance, it just feels like we got real bearish not breaking $8000, but who the hell knows. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:48:51
It’s pretty simple, an exchange is like a bank, when you have fiat in a bank, the bank using your money to make loans, pay off other people, you know, bank stuff. 
So you don’t really control your money, if everyone was to pull out all their money from a bank, the bank would be short the total some, this is what happened during the great depression. 
When you leave your coins on the exchange, the exchange is doing the same thing with your coins as the bank does with your money, yes you have control over the coins, but it’s just a number the exchange shows you, they trade the coins around, so, again, if everyone pulled their coins out of the exchange, he exchange would have trouble meeting the demand. 
The only was to have 100% control of your coins is to move them to a hardware or paper wallet. 
Yes the exchange controls the private keys, yes your nano will give 100% control. 
If anyone had any corrections on my comments, please feel free to help out.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:16:29
Oh, you’d think he’d try to clear that up. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:05:36
I’d be happy too, it’s just Shady to delete your wayyy off predictions, will you at least admit that? 
You keep throwing out these predictions, Miss by a ton, then do it again, you could be costing people tons of money on here, the new people don’t know what to do, it’s reckless. 
At least leave up ALL your comments, so people can look at your history and come to their own conclusion on if they should trust you.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:13:09
Am I? Huh, ok, you’re so kind, I guess this bubble will pop with you all blindly holding, btw, I own BTC, I’m just not sold on the tech, yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:43:33
They have so much money, why would they ever rely on someone else’s tech? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:13:27
So, you don’t use banks, credit cards, checks, online payments or any other form of payment besides cash? 
FYI, if you’ve got all your cash in your house, it could be stolen or burned in a fire, then POOF.

You must not watch CNBC very much, but I get what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:28:58
That’s the plan, Thought I️ had it set correctly. But it kinda feels like the miners are trying to hold us all hostage, no?
If we don’t pay the high fees, we have to wait days, this will never be a real currency like this, miners have all the control, am I️ wrong? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:42:42
Slow confirmation time, high transfer fees, limited supply, high cost of mining. 
I can keep going, this is a bubble, not a revaluation 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:50:30
To much money at risk for me to believe in these other scum bags. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:54:52

I’m happy for the kids, the dads an asshole. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:43:46
So, you have no idea what bitcoin will be?
Doesn’t that concern you?
But they’re still video games and will always be video games. 
They haven’t changed, they’re just better versions of the older ones. 
So, bitcoin will just be a better version of this? 
So, you think it will be a asset. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:13:11
Sigh, they really keep pushing this, don’t they.

Lesson learned, can’t change the pass, good for you at getting back with it. 
All you can do is not make the same mistake twice  
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:03:02
It’s real concern and to not think it needs addressed is foolish, it’s happened before, if you had a major crash and people all tried to cash out, it could get ugly really fast. 
It’s not somewhere that’s very safe to keep your money, that’s all the article says. 
Why is it total bullshit? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:42:01
Well, 65 and 22 million isn’t so bad 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:34:16

Sell now, then, bet you won’t, dude, calm down, you’re going to ride this with the rest of this, take that frown and turn it upside down. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:25:08
Yes, of course, but if they had money in the pump and dump of BCH, spreading FUD in a sub that doesn’t make you any money isn’t that big of a deal. 
That’s what people are saying, they had skin in the game on that side, i have no idea if they did or not, but some of what that post says adds up. 
That weekend on here got really really strange, nothing got removed, it was a FUD fest and nothing was done to stop it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:24:01
Amazon no, but investment wise, Groupon sucks, instagram is down and twitter is barley holding on. 
But not amazon, they are just fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:15:05
So you think this is just a cash grab? no pun intended and all the miners go back to BTC when it adjusts tomrrow evening?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:32:07
No, this is what a bearish chart looks like, we’d all be happy to look at your bullish chart. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:30:44
Value, not much more of a statement about the reaction to movement and a place for people to discuss it, didn’t say what was going to happen or tell them what they should be doing. 
It’s a comment on the New users in the sup freaking out last night. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:52:06
So, you’re asking? Not telling? 
I don’t see any why you’d think that it’s started, just set another ATH and is now holding above $7,300. 
He hit an ATH yesterday morning, pulled back around $600 to ,$6,800, bounced off that, then set an new ATH less the 24 hours later. 
It now has a new floor set around $7,300, what out of that gives you a sign of a pull back starting? 
 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:25:44
I think he’s right, people are in fear of missing out and think they will get rich quick. 
It’s concerning.

Do you live off the savings?
If the savings went poof tomorrow, would you just be sad or in real trouble?
What is the savings doing for you, what’s the growth or interest it’s earning?
Could you handle losing everything you’ve saved? 
Are you prepared for the stress of going “all in” on something? 
Sit down and talk to yourself about all of these questions, then see what side looks better. 
This is a HIGH risk investment, big gains, big loses. 
Good luck

Started buying a few months ago, I have 1.5 BTC at the moment, if I sold right now, I’d profit $4,000, but I won’t be selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:45:31
It’s feeling very bearish at the moment, I think early next week after a slow weekend. 
$7500 is the floor it seems, if we break that, I’ve seen charts at $6800, where I’d happily throw more money in. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:57:34
It’s not wrong, it’s crazy that it’s this price, it pays no dividends and you can’t really buy anything with it. 
Personally I don’t send tons of money P2P, who really does? 
This is all speculation buying. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:15:24
If you sell it for fiat, it will, but yes, if you never do that, you’re in better shape.

If you’re trying to secure a mortgage, then no, title companies will not expect it, nor will banks, you might get a private lender too, but you’d still have the title issues  
Realtor for 7 years in two different states, with over $25,000,000 in sales, I have knowledge in this field.  
You could show it as proof of funds, but you’d have to sell it off for fiat before the sale and transfer it to title that way. 
Only way to buy real estate in the states would be an all crypto purchase, that the seller would have to agree on, you’d have to work out the payment to the title company in fiat, but it can be done, but it’s far far from normal.

I wish he was, but the story checked out, bought $1500 worth in 2010, he’s able to trade and purchase within his trust account. 
The details are spot on, even down to the price buy in and timing, he’s talk to the lawyer of the trust, he’s trying to allow him to divest of them over the next 18 months. 
I brought up the bitcoin, he got real sheepish about it, I pressed him on it, I don’t think it’s a lie and trust me, I grilled him over it. 
He knows the tech, paper wallet, the whole nine yards.

$6250 seems to be a good support level, bounced off it hard this morning.

It’s so funny me, these type of posts, people selling their bitcoin for fiat, it’s clear how many that are in it for the money and not the tech, this is the biggest threat to bitcoin.

Good point, you’re right 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:07:07
As it should. 
The signs of a bubble are getting louder and louder. 
Faster gains at higher prices
People thinking it’s undervalued the higher it gets. 
This is getting worrying, people taking out loans
Everyone talking about how they’re going to be rich! 
This has every single red flag for a bubble, but it’s not a bubble? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:22:05
Why do you say that? Charts point bearish after this pop. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:21:03
$250 plus in a matter of mins, that’s a swing now a days 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:56:19
Something losing 70-90% of its value isn’t a connection, it’s a bubble pop.

@_date: 2017-11-26 05:46:30
Something has to give, here, the bulls are out of control. 
Faster gains at higher prices isn’t a good sign, I sold off much lower then this, never thought it would make back its gains in 12 days. 
Still have a little left, .25 I bought for $500, so not like I’m doing awful. 
But this is just wild. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:12:13
Right? Nothing says this should be happening, no chart, nothing, this is the miners and BCH getting together for a good old pump and dump.

Maybe he’s saying the meme pool is growing, so he thinks there will be another price drop?

Miners don’t want to crash the market, they’re making more money then they ever have before. 
Also, there’s a very easy way to stop them from doing so, just don’t buy or sell BTG, no market, no money, no mining. 
NO2X 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:25:55
This is a prediction, this is actually really happening, Bitcoin is has never been threatened like this, you can’t just blindly hold, the blockchain is under attack. 
If the miners move and it’s looking that way, BCH becomes bitcoin, open your eyes, this isn’t a statement by someone person, this is actually happening as we speak.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:24:11
Think of it as digital gold 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:56:06
You mean $6,612
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:33:50
What he said, it’s a mining play, they will mine the shit out of BCH and hope the Chinese join them, if that happens, BCH will be labeled the New “bitcoin” and the Korean miners will have mined a fuck ton of them, making this rich.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:22:44

Yeah, it wasn’t kosher, that’s for sure, but I think we can come out of this better. 
I hope, anyways. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:31:46
Bitcoin cash is spamming the network, grinding it to a stop, certain mining groups have moved to BCH and are mining it for better profits, they’re hoping the Chinese miners join them, if they Chinese switch, it’s bad, like really bad for BTC
BCH will be labeled the new “bitcoin” and BTC could become worthless. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:27:21
Now, where’s that delete comment button, I’m happy to be wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:18:31
If you sell and take gains in USD, you should report as such, capital gains, if you are just holding it, then no, I would not. 
But this way I pay my account, for these exact issues. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:27:10
This is why people think bitcoin is a scam, gross 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:29:44
If you have to ask if this is a good or bad idea, really shouldn’t be giving financial advice.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:01:38
I meant they talk about BTC a lot, geez
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:45:31
They did it at $1200 less then this, you’re foolish to think they can’t. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:40:57
Maybe he bought it at $5500 last night?
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:16:59
I mean with a company that’s been around, not putting your money into an Exchange, by safely 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:35:22
Exactly, we are all guessing, on both sides of things. 
I didn’t think it was a bubble, until I saw it fall to $5600 and skyrocket back up. 
I started to research more and it has every single sign pointing to a bubble. 
But I could be very wrong, you’re right, time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:51

Pump and dumb, it’s got a lot of signs pointing that way. 
Big fish control this market, they wait for the little fish to follow the “buying” trend, then the big fish sell off and eat all the little fish up on the way down. 
It’s pretty simple, just keep your eyes on it, might be a nice dip to buy into.

People are going to learn the hard way about how risky crypto is. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:06:36
Seems like you’ve got a good outlook on it, but that’s not the norm here anymore, you can’t even talk about the tech, people just rant about price. 
I sold all my BTC, during the attack, because I learned at how bad the tech is at the moment, it’s concerning. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:42:07

FUD? Bitcoin just lost over $2000 in 48 hours and there’s 140,000 in the meme pool. 
That’s what I’m seeing, nothing else, I already sold and have made money by doing so, but hodl away, I will buy back into it and have the same amount of coin for less money. 
Ya, the FUD has really taken hold of me. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:30:52
I can’t believe the reaction, I thought people were coming in for the double coin, I was soooo wrong. 
$10,000 here we come!!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:06:56
He’s right about the commodity part, that’s what it’s become, with all these new people buying BTC. 
I’d say 85% are in it for the money, just look at this sub, now. 
 
People screaming about what it’s worth in USD, you know, the exact thing BTC was designed to destroy. 
Do I think BTC is dead, no way, do I think it will be a real currency, no, not at all. 
It’s internet gold now, is it a bad thing, I don’t think so, but it’s not going to be used as a currency in a mass scale at this point. I just don’t see how that’s possible at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:36:53

This is an interesting moment for the bull rush that’s been happening, there’s nothing really happening, it’s just normal, fork is done for now, so there’s not much to talk about. 
The futures market opening up will be our next be into war, I’ve read November 20th? But can’t seem to find a confirm on that, I️ think it’s going to be pretty flat until then, maybe a steady climb up towards $8,000, but otherwise this seems to be were we hang around for a while.

As long as you can handle it being worth half that or worse, I’m not saying it will, but remember this was worth $600 a year ago.

Ok, then look at this as digital gold, instead of “owning” a rock, you own code, no one else can own that code, but you. 
Can you touch it, no, but it’s a new technology, if you believe in the technology and think the gold standard is something that’s past it’s prime, then bitcoin and the blockchain are great for you. 
If you think it’s a “poniz scheme” think sell and move on, it’s pretty simple.

Wow, you weren’t kidding 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:05:52
Just be carful, I meant more, be carful, it was poorly worded. 
If you look at what’s gone on, holding has been the best thing you could do, by far. 
If you want to hedge your bet, sell some and hold the others, watch closely, set some stop orders and buy orders, big risk, big reward, small risk, small reward. 
Just depends on how must risk you’d like to take, but the one thing you shouldn’t do is panic, just don’t do that and you’ll be ok. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:13

Seems wild, but a strange thing to lie about, but he doesn’t have access to the money, it’s in the trust, can’t touch it till he’s 65.
Here’s the thing, why can’t it be true? People took shots in bitcoin in 2010, no one saw this coming so soon. 
Good be bullshit, but if he closes his insurance office and retires, we will know it’s true.  
The reason I think it’s true is, it’s a crazy number to lie about, 21,000, it’s so out there no one would believe you, so lying seems pointless, if he said 500, you’d go along with it no problem.

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:51:42
Take this as you will, but it seems pretty real. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:35:35
But it’s not, there’s only one internet, there’s loads of crypto coins, the blockchain isn’t bitcoin and bitcoin isn’t the blockchain. 
So everybody thinks bitcoin is going to take over the US dollar and the US government is going to do nothing to stop it? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:17:49
Isn’t the lighting network going to tack transactions of the blockchain? 
Please correct me if I’m wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:37:59
Yea, it is, this market is fucking crazy right now. 
Get your stop loss protected, this could pop. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:58:36
Riding it out, best thing to do is not panic, it’s going to interesting, to say they least, I have my coin in my bither wallet, keeping off the exchange, in case this go crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:17:30
If that holds, then yes, but it could change in a matter of seconds, but if you look around this sub, a lot of people are thinking a big sell off at or around $10,000
Just keep an eye on it and project yourself with a stop loss, if you want. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:56:20
It’s wild, if you followed that idea, you’d be cleaning the hell up, right know. 
I just can’t believe they’re at it again. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:01:22
It’s interesting, that’s for damn sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:21:24
I’m just glad it’s over, sky didn’t fall and the blockchain is safe.

It’s happened before, they do have federal insurance, so that helps. 
But, no there’s nothing stopping them from folding, it’s a concern 
It would hurt things, a lot, trust is a big part of doing business

I’ve also used my card to buy, you need to call the back back, this isn’t correct. 
You are the only report of this happening with Chase that I’ve ever seen. 
They might to trade futures if BTC, something isn’t correct here.

Thanks I️ will
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:45:27
I’m not saying you’re wrong, I’m just talking about risk management, you’ve put yourself in the upper levels of risk, that’s all I’m saying. 
Man, I totally hope it works for you and you kill it! 
I just worry when I see posts about people putting money they don’t have into a high risk market, but if you’ve got the fiat put away to payoff the debit and are just leveraging others peoples money, then I totally get it. 
I’m in real state, we do it all the time, but we have a house to give them if it goes bad. 
Kill it!! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:24:03
and it just broke, I sold, I'm sitting this one out, this is real and not FUD, BTC is under attack and it's losing.

I.E. this past weekend
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:52:20
Could get scary, I sold around where we are now and have buys set up down too $5550. 
That was a solid bottom last night, but I will have my eyes on the screens

Square is sneaky, you’re selling your bitcoin in a round about way, it gets turned into fiat right away. 
Didn’t know that’s what they were up too

Lol, I wonder what’s driving this dip, besides profit taking, but it seems to be the pattern of late. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:50:16
Yes, that could happen, they’re aren’t approved, people are buying the news, you’re correct that if they went, sorry, we aren’t doing it anymore, it will be a sell off.
Don’t think it would kill anything, just be a pull back. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:59:06

You’d have a selloff, it’s unlikely to happen, but yes, yes that could happen. 
Bitcoin has no protection against something like that, like the stock market does.

Posts like these, are why this sub has gone to shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:04:28
Yes that’s a “gap”
But this is a “gap down”
First, let's make sure what a gap down is: It's when a stock trades an entire day in a price range below the prior session's low. The "gap" from the prior day's low to the high of the next day tells investors that market makers and specialists on the stock exchanges had to bring the share price low enough to draw enough buyers.
As I said, I think we are talking about the same thing, but with different terms. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:28:54
No, but it will most likely get canceled after 72 hours, don’t worry, your coins haven’t gone anywhere, you’re just stuck in the attack on the network at the moment, you won’t lose your coins, don’t worry about that.

Well, what % of those viewers have money to burn, the average American has little to no savings, look it up, it’s terrifying. 
Here's the percentage of the 8,000 survey respondents who have:
$0 saved: 39 percent
Less than $1,000 saved: 18 percent
$1,000 to $4,999 saved: 12 percent
$5,000 to $9,999 saved: 6 percent
$10,000 or more saved: 25 percent
Let’s look at these numbers, so around 7 million get thrown right out the door. Now another 1.5 millionish have less then a $1000, odds are they won’t be throwing money blindly into bitcoin. 
Now let’s look into the age of the viewer, it’s very safe to say, that the older you are, the more money you have saved, so let’s look at the viewership numbers
It was a Thursday 8pm time slot for the popular family series, and rose to the top sport in viewers fast, with 17 million. Holding the broad age range of 18-49 year old viewers.
More then half of those people are under 35 years of age, that means less savings. 
My point being is, yes, most of the people watching aren’t invested in BTC, because they can’t be, it’s foolish to think all those people have money to burn and invest in anything, let alone BTC. 
It’s good word of mouth, but that’s about it, you won’t see a bunch of money come into the market the next day from the viewers of a TV show. 
This is a really basic break down things, if we go deeper it gets worse. 
Most America’s live paycheck to paycheck, I don’t know if you do or not, but if you’re messing around in the crypto world, I’d think you don’t. 
Not trying to rain on your parade, but it’s word of mouth, not much else.

This is flawed, EVERYONE owned tech stock, during the bubble pop, it was part of almost all stock portfolios, his isn’t the case for Bitcoin, it’s market cap isn’t anywhere near the total of the .com stocks. 
I’m not saying that he’s wrong, I’m just pointing out a major issue with any bubble comparison, maybe  1% own bitcoin, that’s no where close to the amount of people that owned tech stocks before the pop. 
This is never touched on, it drives me crazy.

Just wondering, you’re new to the market and haven’t been around for what has happened with BTC before, so talking shit to the people who have seen major market crashes isn’t the wisest thing to do.

If you bought before the fork, You have equal amounts of BCH and BTC, CoinBase has said they won’t release the BCH you have if you held in a CoinBase wallet during the fork, until January 1st

Thanks for the charts and the breakdown, looks like the rally has cooled for the moment. 
Sells coming in now, but that’s profit taking, it seems. 
I took a beating over the weekend, trying to get back in around $6100, lost a good amount of my profit, but none of my investment, so it could be a lot worse and I still have .24 BTC, but I missed the bottom, like a fool.

I can’t babysit everyone, if they panic sell this weekend, then they need to get the hell out of this market, because last weekend showed them exactly how it goes. 
I don’t think we will see that level of sell off, Meme pool isn’t as bad, but who knows what these guys are up too, they’re pretty good at fudging this market. 
Oh, What will the weekend bring!?!?

It’s such an easy market to do that too, why wouldn’t they?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:42:26
Sure, but I’d keep an eye on them, fork is still awhile away. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:39:48
I think he sells only as a nuclear option, tries to crash the price of BTC by flooding the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:54:56
No, I’m saying IF we hold here and bounce off back up, I think you’ll have a good indication of where people want in at and where they see a value buy. 
And yes, a big buy wall does help support that idea, but time will tell and it’s bounced back up over $7,000 for now.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:09:12
And that’s the billion dollar question, what tech is best suited to deal with that exact thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:37:38
Link? He puts out a lot of stuff, not saying he’s wrong, but he says so much, hard to know what’s right or wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:27:08
No, it’s going to stabilize when the futures market opens, it’s going to get boring.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:42:22
I 2nd this
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:18:42
It’s profit taking, you should see the buy wall on GDAX at the moment, it’s like if we don’t blast through every ATH, the sky is falling. 
Great post though, well thought out comment and your information to support it, wow, top notch. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:27:06
4K !?!?!?
Don’t tease me
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:45:15
Speculation, no other reason. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:33:18
Have to lean towards the last one, miners will go where the profit is.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:24:42
That’s not socialism, first of all, it’s capitalism. 
But ya, I’d be happy to pay more now, didn’t realize setting your wallet to High payment isn’t really High, that’s all I’m saying, I️ just want to move my BTC, this is why it won’t be a currency any time soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:55:10
Well, you did it now, don’t worry to much about it, this is normal for the market, looks like we will bounce around between $7,000 &amp; $7,300 for a while, it’s like the Grand Canyon on GDAX at the moment. 
Hang in, I think we will be around these prices over night.   
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:52:51
I guess we have different definitions of that term, but yes, you’re correct, nothing is fool proof, of course. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:43:16
It does when you’re involved in market manipulation, it makes perfect sense. 
Seems like it was an inside job. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:49:59
If there was only a way to look up every transaction ever made on the blockchain. 
Ugh, these old dudes really like to talk about shit they know nothing about. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:10:20
Maybe buy 25% of what you want to buy, then buy more of if moves in ether direction? It’s best to buy on averages.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:56:50
CoinBase just added 100,000 new accounts in the last 24 and 100,000’s before that, the hard fork is the only real target you can pin point, if a correction is going to happen. 
I don’t feel there will be one, you’ll see dips, but I don’t feel BTC is overvalued at this point, you still have tons of people that want in on it.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:45:21
Unless Wall Street shorts BTC in the futures market and it’s pointing that way. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:18:13
I️ hear you, trust me, but the lighting network should clear up these issues, have you read up on that? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:41:54
No, he’s always been against it, others in the firm disagree. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:21:05
I think you’ve got a little while, that sell wall is getting higher. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:21:55
Seems, it
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:28:58
I didn’t, don’t worry��
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:27:17
Sell on the next bump 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:28:51
Wtf are you talking about, decreasing at what rate? It’s been pretty steady at this price for almost 5days, besides the quick pop. 
Bitching about the price at $7,200, the greed here is unreal. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:21:01
Bull back? It’s sitting at $7,300 plus at the moment, it’s hirer then yesterday and only $100 off it’s all time high.
What on earth are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:42:25
It’s a couple hundred of an all time high, my god, what more do you want?  
TBH, you should sell, I don’t think bitcoin is the correct investment for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:29:14
Tone best thing I’ve read about what’s going on, thanks for sharing OP, I learned a lot from this. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:55:48
Didn’t say it would die, just saying it too heavy. 
You’ve been on Reddit 3 months, calm your tits. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:37:28
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:35:23
It’s a different market, it really is, New money with smart investors behind it, you have a real futures market be launched, that will bring in the herd. 
You can’t compare it to 2013 based only in charts, this isn’t just running up, because it’s just running up. You have real news and real investors backing it, I think long one BTC folks need to learn to adjust to a new style of market.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:11:54
They’re up, it’s past 5am and their price alarms had been going off, ALTS recovered and BTC has leveled  
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:06:35
 Because it’s sexy, big swings, fast profits, fast loses, that’s why people like action movies more then they like a slow sell thought out period piece. 
It’s pretty simple, it gets the media clicks and ratings. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:45:11
I was half joking, you’re right, he got screwed 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:07:40
The US government could ban the purchase of it, so intern, you couldn’t link a bank account or CC to any exchange or have any exchange based In the US, that would crash bitcoin at least 90%
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:08:07
Then that’s awesome, depending on where you bought in, of course. 
But that’s a long way away. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:49:27
Why do they know that? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:21:20
Man, people are going to shit their pants when this goes back to a bear market. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:59:06
Question, when did you first buy BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:48:00
Ha, you know what I mean, sorry if that wasn’t clear. 
I’m just concerned people have been trying to move to the exchange for 2-3 days and it will slowly clear, so they start to do what they were trying to do a couple days ago. 
But who the hell knows, I for sure don’t. Just a thought, because people are pissseeeddd
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:48:23
That’s good! Means you’re not losing anything, I️’m still bullish, but it will be slower on the rise. 
If you’re long term and not looking to buy a dip, I’d walk away for a couple days, no need to follow it so closely. 
I️ bought some more at $7,700 yesterday, but if I️ had thought $7,700 was its ceiling, I️ wouldn’t have bought it. 
I️ want to know what BTC will be 3 years from now, that’s what I️ really care about.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:12:41
Point taken
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:19:02
He’s got money, but I suspect no where near what he claims it is. 
Nothing about that guy’s checks out, lied about military background, lies about poker winnings, he’s a social media bullshitter. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:13:33
The tech is the last thing in anyone’s mind anymore, this has become all about money. 
CME trading bitcoin futures, how much will it rise today! 
But yet, we have a major issue with transaction times, prices and how open the network is to attack. 
All I here is, oh don’t worry, that will be fixed! Umm, well it’s not and who’s even working on it anymore? 
Now the lighting network is coming, that will take traction’s off the blockchain, because, you know, that’s what Bitcoin is all about. 
This isn’t about the tech, anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:47:18
So, you’re wrong, more then you’re right and being bearish for 4 days, isn’t a thing, you just throw out numbers over and over, you don’t help anyone, provide zero data to back up anything you say. 
What’s the point? Oh it’s going to hit this, oh it’s going to do this, what are you trying to do with saying this? 
You don’t help anyone, you don’t provide tacts, you just spew your predictions and you do understand, that at any level someone has bought, they’d be in the black, but maybe some you bough just above $6,000, I’ve looked at your posts, nothing but random numbers and when you miss by $100 you say you’re right, come on, what’s the point to any of what you say? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:43:53
I sold most of my holdings a couple weeks ago, just held my profit amount in BTC, so I won’t lose any of my investment if this all goes to shit. 
Bought 4.40 of ETH 6 days ago, that’s made me feel smart, but who knows. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:11:37
Like Sonic the hedge hog hitting a spike
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:29:42
Oh  I️ know, I️ get it, but it’s making it hard to use BTC as what it was intended, you know what I️ mean? Just frustrating to be held hostage now, if the high setting on my wallet means nothing, that’s an issue, no? 
I’m just stuck, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:11:59
Well, it is how trusts work, but I really don’t care if he has them or not. 
The trust can’t be cashed out until he’s 65, his grandfather set it for him when he was born, has stocks and what not attached to it, he’s aloud to make investments with in the trust, like the restaurant he’s open his wife, $500,000 build out, he also is going to work with me flipping houses. 
The guy has money, This shit happens, but I’m not about to go proving it on Reddit, I could give a shit if he’s lying or not, has nothing to do with me. 
It’s amazing how green with envy people become, if he’s lying, ok, strange thing to lie to me about, in such great detail for no reason, but fine, he’s lying, whoopie!! You won the internet for the day, people did this, they bought shit loads of BTC many years ago, most sold it, but he didn’t, because he can’t sell anything that’s in the trusts name.
So it makes more sense that he’s held it this entire time, because he couldn’t sell it, sure, I will get right on that with his public key, how should I explain it? 
Hey man, can you give me your public key, this random dude on Reddit wants me to prove you could buy and sell him like a used car, ok cool thanks. 
Wait here, I will be right back with that info. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:42:33
Be carful calling anything “Black Friday” in the fading market.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:20:41
Profiting taking, stop orders, people aren’t sure if the news is real. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:46:31
Miners bailed out, can’t fork and fail, better to get out ahead of it and say you’ve called it off. 
Save face. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:07:30
Now it it’s just, what’s going to happen now, at least it’s now and not 10 days away still. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:25:33
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:26:56
Got it, wanted to make sure, thanks!
This is really getting strange, putting a very bad taste in my mouth about this ever becoming a main stream thing
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:46:51
Ok, then what? It’s collapsed the USD, now everything is super peachy and what? We use bitcoin to buy everything? 
It can’t handle that, the scaling is fucked, you’d never be able to hide what you buy from anyone, it’s all right there on the blockchain, that flashlight you bought on sale, yep, that’s the transfer right there. 
This is what no one can explain to me, how this transfer to bitcoin from fiat happens, without a total cluster fuck of the US economy. 
  
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:45:51
It’s pretty simple, if bitcoin becomes a threat to the US banking system, the government will act, until then, they don’t care very much. 
If the US government starts to talk about bitcoin in a negative light, that’s when bitcoin will be a real currency, until then, it’s just an asset, internet gold nothing more. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:12:34
Transactions per hour, you know, like Visa? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:51:57
Only 52% of Americans own stock and you think 25% of westerners will own a$1000 bucks worth of bitcoin in 5-8 years!?!!
That’s insane 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:04:46
Yes, that’s correct, if you’ve got coins in the exchange, that’s a different story, you should only hold coins there if you’re trading them. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:05:17
Wow, spot on write up, from 9 months ago, no less, I have to say this attack opened my eyes to how terrible the tech is with Bitcoin. 
Imagine if this was really adopted and the USA was really using this to buy goods and the network was spammed like this, we’d be helpless.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:11:45
It’s a month, not tomorrow, so, no, we can’t tell you 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:04:21
Looks like they’re working on their own coin
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:09:39
Not a problem, vent away
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:28:08
I don’t think you’re wrong, was just pointing out how many BTC one person has, it’s really not like most markets, where one person has so much power over a market. 
This is all really strange to me, BTC is having the worst fees and meme pool it’s ever had and the price is rising. 
i smell another pump and dump, the market manipulation in BTC and BCH is at a level I’ve never seen. 
Hard for the average human to stand a chance. 
BTC has a major tech issue, with its transfer times and exposures to attacks. 
Not saying BCH is the answer, but it’s a problem no one seems to have an answer for, it’s become a religion, not a technology.   
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:34:29
It just won’t happen, now it’s back to business as usual. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:36:01
They just shot a missile into the Sea of Japan, now ATH, why do you think again will change?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:12:19
Well, most banks take 24 hours to transfer funds, unless you wire it, but that has, guess what? 
High fees!!!
Welcome to the scaling debate. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:03:57
This is a flawed outlook, what is high enough? 
That’s different for everyone, some will just be getting in now, some got in years ago, some got in months ago.
The point you’re making can be used for any asset, oh, well, everyone will sell when it’s high enough. It’s rude to make comments about something you have no knowledge of, what if someone saw this and didn’t know you know nothing about BTC? 
Delete the post, it doesn’t do anyone any good, read up and then come back. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:13:45
You’re right, I’ve got a buy in at $6725, when that goes, I️ will a $300 lesson, I️ sold 1.48 at $6,500, but it will be profit loss, so it wasn’t real money anyway. 
Thanks for the pep talk 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:26:23
Oh no, I have no issue with what he said, I was referring to the fact he said, go to church to feel safe. 
No where is safe anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:19:10
That’s not wrong either, it’s rough out there, but nothing showing a rally anytime soon here. 
Those lows are for sure I play. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:34:41
Well, it was and still could, but keep holding away and advising people that don’t have BCH to do the same, you have a flood attack on BTC that’s still going on. 
Move some coin, see how that works out for you and if you look at my comments, I did talk about $5500 being a support level. 
Anyway, I buy and sell your net worth in a day, but you’re the expert with that .0010 BTC you have. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:28:59
It does and you’re correct 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:27:17
It will flirt with that level again, just keep your eyes on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:43:49
This is a pump and dump of BCH, I️ feel a lot of people are going to lose their greedy little shirts 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:26:30
Yea, it’s going to be interesting to watch, but the really word seems to be, Wall Street is going to short bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:21:25
You’ll see some selling it’s having a hard time staying above $6500, try and stagger your buys so you end up with an average. 
It’s the best way to handle your risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:28:28
I believe we need to bring the S2x into the fold, their ideas aren’t wrong, but the way they wanted to go about it was the issue, we can all do this together, I see no reason why we can’t. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:43:18
It’s fucking batshit 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:22:28
It’s says, miners like higher fees, so the higher fees get cleared, isn’t that controlled by the miners or is a default setting? If it is, I’m 100% incorrect and admit that. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:40:00
I was referring to when or if it hits 10K and there’s a quick sell off. 
Isn’t Gap down when it trades below the high of the day before and slowly retracts and not a sudden loss? 
If I’m incorrect please excuse me, I was trying to explain how to maybe protect himself from a quick and sudden selloff. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:23:54
I’m sure you’re right, but just be careful 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:25:25

@_date: 2017-11-11 00:38:22
This site worked for me, you’ll have to pay a little more, but my stuck 1.5 was confirmed shortly after I️ used it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:45:43
Ok, well, time will tell and I hope you’re correct, but shits getting very real and the name won’t matter if the miners don’t mine it. 
There’s a shit of BCH out there and if they can pump the price, they will make a killing. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:40:13
You’re just stuck in the meme pool, like everyone else, bitcoin cash scumbags are spamming the network with micro transactions, grinding everything to a stop.
Good news, your coin is safe, it hasn’t really left your wallet.
Bad news, you’re stuck until it gets cleared up, could be a day or two. 
After 72 hours, it will most likely just get canceled and be back in your wallet, there’s not much you can do at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:57:20
But I’d be worried to, if I was as deep in as you are, remember that bitcoin was worth $600 a year ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:40:45
I️ used this site today, was stuck in the meme pool, paid $4 bucks and I️ was confirmed in less then an hour, it works and with 95,000 in the meme pool at the moment, $4 is nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:11:05
This isn’t normal, miners are on strike, in a way, but at least you’re standing your ground,about it all.
Oh wait.......
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:23:20
Not scaring anyone, this is Information, that’s all, haven’t told one person what they should do with it. 
They are grown ups, so with it as they please. 
It bounced off $5,500 pretty well, but it looks like it will test it again, I’d buy back in anywhere near that level. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:51:36
Question, why would you sell before the fork, this is what I’m not understanding. 
If and that’s if, Sx2 takes over, that means you’d have to buy back in and have no idea when to do, if seems like a major risk for a reward of what? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:32:16
They’re just jelly
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:50:12
You can move BTC, it just takes a long time and costs a lot at the moment, it’s not wrong it’s just worded poorly. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:56:41

@_date: 2017-11-18 16:39:13
When he posted this, it’s was dropping, “the” was auto corrected. Didn’t mean for it to be general  
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:04
Let’s put it like this, there’s wayyyyy more people who have ruined their lives dealing in bitcoin, then their are, who have become rich. 
Also, bitcoin isn’t about becoming rich, it’s about turning it into a new currency, if BTC where do do what it’s designed to do, all your stupid memes would mean nothing, because the USD would be worthless. 
The irony of all this is unreal. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:30:11
Well, yea, why would you sell, I get that, but the heavy buy side I don’t get, really seems like people think CME is going to level out the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:21:45
Well, in a way, yes, but after you posted this, it dropped to $5600 and buying at $6100 is fine, my point is, this sub isn’t for this kind of stuff. 
If you must post it put a disclaimer at least, but there’s a whole other sub for this kind of stuff. 
BTW, buying at $5600 crush’s your posted buy statement, ����‍♂️ 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:33
Ok, so you haven’t made anything, yet, the debit is there and real, your holdings are just numbers until you sell it and payoff the debit, we aren’t tying to shit on you, we just don’t want to see you get in a bad spot. 
Taking out debt to buy is about as high risk there is, why not sell what you need to pay off the card and keep the profit in BTC? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:37:05
For your reading pleasure. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:45:52

All passing fads, that’s kinda worrying. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:06:14
What’s “all in” mean to you? If you were to lose it, would you ruin your life, if so, that’s never a good idea, this market could swing back to $600 in a heartbeat. 
Risk what you can handle losing, it’s the best way to deal with it.

Ok, fair enough, I’m sorry if you felt I was harassing you, I didn’t mean for it to come off that way if it did, but you make bold statements, don’t supply any info or data as to why, you’re going to put a big target on your back. 
Taking a step back is a good thing, I hope you can get back in, I don’t want you to lose money, but you need to look at the market from a different angle now, it’s got real money coming in and is just being learned about by most people. 
It’s not us against them, it’s us, trying to make Jen understand what we are all about. 
Good luck man, I really wish nothing but the best for you.

A quote I read
“I don’t know one rich person, that has all their savings in bitcoin, but, I know many poor people that do”
It really stuck with me, this has become a money grab, it’s not about changing the world. 
Screaming about the price of BTC in fiat, the exact thing it was designed to destroy, oh the irony in that is next level. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:28:30
Hard to see, are you showing a base level at $5000?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:50:22
It’s such a great tech, with some many new things using its blockchain. 
It was cheap at $370 when I got it, if it takes off even more, I will be happy I got in when I did. 
People don’t get it, it’s a better version of BTC, but it’s not as sexy at the moment, anyone that’s really into crypto owns some ETH or at least respects it. 
If you see a major pull back from BTC, the money goes into ALTS and I will be waiting with open arms. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:42:06
Well, there’s a lot of factors, CME with it’s futures market isn’t a great thing for bitcoin, it will be the first time major major money can Short BTC safely, that’s worrying.
Also, you’re going to have a ton of new money in the market at these really high buy in prices, so, you’ll have billions at risk in the ATH levels. 
That money is scared money, any dip and we know we can see some big dips, will cause a panic sale in a a lot of new money people. 
There’s a lot of things working against it right now, this is looking more and more like a bubble every day. 
 
This is a very interesting read, a lot of very good factual points made. 
So with what you will, just be mindful of who you’re up against.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:16:08

Don’t think it breaks $6,000 at any point, nothing says that cart wise, strong wall at $6250  
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:04:30
If the US were to deem it “illegal” then you’d see a major set back in price, I’d think 90% pull back. 
It would still be around, but it would pretty much crush mass adoption in the United States for a long time to come. 
The FED spoke out against BTC yesterday, it’s on their radar now, I wouldn’t be surprised if Trumps people don’t want to due away with it, it’s old money vs new. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:08:44
You’re not the only one, this is a big problem and BTC won’t be the same because of it. 
The rumblings of Wall Street shorting BTC are something to really watch, if they want to make something happen, it’s pretty hard to stop them, it’s rather scary. 
Next month is a massive test for what bitcoin is and will become, the greed of people on this sub has blinded people to what this really is, it’s a tech that is trying to replace the use of fiat money, it’s pretty foolish to think Wall Street and the banks won’t try to deal it accordingly, good post.

They’re playing catch up and will be for a while, they added so many new accounts over the last few months, by mostly noob traders that think it’s easy money, they are overwhelming their system. 
It will hopefully get better with time, but you’re 100% right, for the amount of money moves through them, they should be much better.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:53:45
Totally agree, I meant I’d post again, thanks for that info, I think you’re making a good point. 
I bought on the way down, I’m new to this, but I think I’m about to buy another .50
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:54:19
It’s only worth what someone is willing to buy it for, it’s up the buyers, that’s will set the market price. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:46:01
Also,  100 days from now on, WTF does that even mean? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:09:12
Ok, why?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:12:36
Well, in a way, yes, but I don’t sell unless I’m lookin to free up money to buy on a dip.
Here’s a very simple way to invest in BTC, if you see a dip, it’s flopping around and you like that price, buy a little, if it goes down a little more, buy a little more. 
Then just hodl, the object is to buy as close to the “floor” that’s been set as you can, then if it goes back up, you wait it out, watch for a new “floor” to establish and buy some more, repeat this pattern, note the prices you’ve bought at and track your % growth of your holdings. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:27:40
Phase 1, starting to move to phase 2, would be my best guess, it’s easy to know that it’s not close to phase 3, just ask random people if they know about BTC or by chance own any, it’s the easiest phase to gauge in a way. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:24:19
It's back up, I guess then woud have been a good time
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:27:21

No, usually they work for themselves, I’ve been with my mine for over a decade, he knows more about me then anyone I work with. 
I’d start by asking your friends and family who they trust, it’s a good place to start. Mine is located in Los angles, but can work with you in any state. 
If you’re really that lost on where to start, PM me and I will give you his information, he’s good and works with people from all walks of life.

I buy on dips and hodl, day trading right now isn’t worth the risks, I’ve made way more just buying on dips, I protect my self with limit sells set up if need be, but that’s rare I execute them, I have just about 1.75 BTC, All bought at different prices, if I was to sell now, I’d have a return of over 20%, that’s about 2 1/2 years if I had invested it in a mutual fund, for the same return.

People are moving back into their ALT coins, a lot of money was moved into BTC to get the new coins after the forks. At this moment ETH and Lite are up 3.30% and 2.34% they’re off the highs of the day, but that could change or it could not, that’s crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:34:47

Don’t think you’re wrong here, was just pointing out that BTC is changing and we have to learn how to react to it. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:48:07
I agree, this is just a dip, a healthy taking of profits that happens, I think we push past $6,000 on a steady climb as people see the stability in BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-31 21:15:26
Well, look at it this way, what price do you think it will be?
And will a few $100 make a difference at that number? Don’t sweat the little stuff, pull the trigger if you’re bullish on BTC.  
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:25:49
Ya, it’s total bullshit, you’re not the first person to post something like this on here, the banks screwed us all in ‘08 and got away with it. The government didn’t do anything but bail them out for it, now it’s time for us to show them what we think of them, they’re getting worried. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:53:22
Wait, what? So, it’s 90 days? Not 100 days, also the way he worded it is fucked
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:50:44
There’s always risk, but it’s pretty safe from what I understand, well I hope so, anyway. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:38:17
Here’s the simple answer, do you believe it will be worth more or less in the amount of time you want to hold it, if you believe it will be worth $500,000 in 4 years, then why wouldn’t you buy it now? 
If you think it will be worth $7,000 in 9 months, why wouldn’t you buy it now? 
If you think it will be worth less then it is now, then why would you buy it now? 
Don’t over think it, it’s really that simple. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:22:04
If they feel it’s easier to except Bitcoin, instead of developing their own.

@_date: 2017-10-23 16:21:08
Coinbase to outside wallet has fees
Coinbase to GDAX is free
GDAX to outside wallet is free as well
It’s going to take some time to get confirmed, just hang in there. 
Low fees means longer transfer times. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:12:48
I never said that, either, that’s why I’m not sure what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:35:03
You’re asking people to predict the future, no one has any idea if or when a dip is coming, if someone tells you they know, they’re lying to you. 
Buy when it’s right for you, if you think bitcoin will be worth more in the future, then now is as good a time as any to buy. 
Good luck

Not much, you should have the same amount of GOLD as BTC, you don’t have to do anything really. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:05:54
Long term, if you think BTC will double triple or shoot to the moon, a couple hundred in a dip isn’t going to make much of a difference in the long run, break up your buys and leave it be, trying to guess a dip to maybe get a $200 bump, isn’t really worth missing the boat on a big up turn and as of now, it’s just moving up, but that’s right now. 
Good luck  
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:03:23
Do you have anything to back this or are you just pissed you sold at $4,400?
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:13:05
Well, there’s a lot of reasons, one is people like the idea of having money be theirs, yes you control you fiat dollars, but you have to answer to a higher power when you want to do things with it, like move it out of the country or transfer it to another person, you have to explain why and how. 
Once the average person understands that we aren’t all lowlifes and scumbags in the crypto world, that will really appeal to they them.
Also, who the hell likes big bankers? Is their really anything worse then those group of people, they totally screwed up in 2008 and did their best to crash the worlds economy, for no other reason then pure greed, so, if we can put those pricks out of a job at some point or even hurt their bottom line, I’m all for that, as I believe most people would be. 
another is we are a global economy, that’s it, no matter how much people kick and scream about it, it just is, what happens in other places effects us, so why not have a way to purchase and invest around the world in a easy stream line way, it’s only logical. 
Also, bitcoin has a way of protecting smaller countries against their governments destroying their economies, it gives the poorest people in the world a chance at protecting themselves against a government that has no interest in protecting its people. 
The gold standard was fine for what we needed it to be, but we have evolved past it, people scream and yell about, if but BTC isn’t based on anything, well, yes it is, it’s based on math and us, not a shiny rock, try buying a pizza with gold flakes and see how far that gets you in this day and age, selling gold is a pain in the ass and isn’t easy to do, but yet people think you can go to 7-11 and buy a soda with, spoiler alert, you can’t. 
I’m for progress, I’m for being a human and betting on us as a global society, BTC makes that easier for us to do. 
It’s a good thing, based on good tech, I want to be along for this ride, I hope others believe in it as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:14:34

It’s going to hit $6,000 with ease, the sell off yesterday happened and the bounce back was nice, trading above $5,700 again, was around $90 off the all time high, we will get another pop here soon. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:01:22
It’s also the 25th in the Asia markets, so you’re pretty spot on, I’d say. Bounce might be sooner though, but I think you’re correct.

BTC has the word of mouth market share, if you ask the average person, maybe they’ve heard of BTC, but it’s rare to never that they’ve heard of any Alt coins. 
The miners will go to where the money is, it’s pretty simple, BTC is where the money is and will be for a long time, but I’m some guy on reddit, so what the hell do I know. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:37:01
That’s a hell of a bet, sorry it didn’t work out, I stopped gambling large sums of money on sports long ago, I took a brutal beat once and I just couldn’t do it anymore, well, better luck next time, but I bet Westbrook comes out like a killer in his next game. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:17:25
Well, I’ve bought on dips like this and it’s worked out so far, guess what, I did again, .25 in my account 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:25:36
Right? It’s something screwy, here’s what happened.
I sent .25 from my Bitter wallet to GDAX 3 days ago, I put to low of fee by miss take, took 3 days, zero confirms. 
I wake up to an two emails from CoinBase both with the same time stamp, one says I’d received the .25 and it was sent to GDAX, then another that says it had failed to transfer and I need to do it manually. 
I sign into my CoinBase on my app to do that, but there’s no balance and nothing in my GDAX either. 
I’m looking at my Bither account, it has 51 confirms but isn’t a closed transfer, I’m wondering if it was canceled after 72 hours, I’ve never had that happen so I’m not sure what to look for. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:08:19
Kinda feels that way, been a slow and steady climb, but it feels like it’s going to make a play at $5,000 again.

Right? Oh, Jamie said it, so I should repeat it is a bad life plan, I just don’t see how you can compare the too, it’s  frustrating.

There’s a very simple way to look at all of this, every single person that has said Bitcoin would fail, has been 100% wrong, so what side would you’d like to be on? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:56:34
Well, they want Bitcoin gold to take off, so they have to flood the media with this idea, the average person isn’t going to buy bitcoin gold, they won’t understand it, any hurdle to investing becomes a wall real quick, if some is new to crypto investing, they will go to the blue chip first, that bluechip is Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:25:53
It’s also really really hard to apply any real to BTC trading, do to the level of emotion trading that goes on with it, so it’s part logic and part do the opposite of what the masses are doing. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:14:11
Thought so, just wanted to double check, I blows me away that they keep using this, it’s not correct in any way, it’s the amount of tulips, not that there were pick or blue and so on, you can just grow more of the damn things! You can’t grow more bitcoin, it’s 21,000,000 and done. Can’t plant them in the yard and get more, trust me I’ve tried.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:40:46
100’s ummm, yes, I’m in the 4 figures and that’s just buying and holding, nothing else, don’t try and trade this market, holding is much better way to make a profit. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:13:25
I just pulled the trigger, bought .50 on my first go. But that’s just me, but you need to pull the band aid or cover I believe you’d call it. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:33:37
That’s insane, the did take 26,000 BTC, that’s worth $111,800,000 now, I wonder if they held it. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:55:49
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:35:32
I would say now, before the fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:46:00
It’s going to take at least 90 mins, a lot of volume being moved, just hang in there. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:54:06
Isn’t this what the fork is all about, bigger blocks, more transactions, faster confirms? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:41:59
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:35:01
It’s going to be $6,000 before the fork, I’m with the slower craw to $6,000, but you’re not wrong!!!
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:30:07
They’re dealing with 35,000 new accounts a day, it’s going to take some time, sit tight. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:38:54
What famous people are posting? I’ve seen Cuban but not much else, but really, take a poll see how it works out, I’d say you won’t get more then 10% and zero who own coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:44:01
So, they sold off the coin and sent fiat to the seller? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:29:16
You live in a bubble, eveyone on here knows about BTC, you seek out others that know BTC, but the average person doesn't have a clue about it. You're just seeking it out, also, stop using a new name, it's pretty lame and how could anyone trust what you post?
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:55:21
Yours in the more in-depth breakdown of what I said, there is no right or wrong answer at this point, the only wrong thing you can do is invest more money then you’re ok with losing. 
Going “all in” never crossed my mind as to a plan, god no, don’t put everything in and pray you don’t ruin your life. 
I’d never suggest that, it terrifies me that someone would do such a thing, I’m suggesting that if you think it’s going to be worth more later, then now is a good place to start as any, because we can’t go back in time. 
Thank you for the thoughtful input, I didn’t mean to come of as reckless.

I tempted to buy a full coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:24:16
Oh, I do, if you’d like to discuss it further PM me, I don’t give that sort of stuff away for free. 
It’s gone up $175 since I bought this morning, but I’m a moron, right?  
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:08:21
Well, this might mean the hobbyists miner can make a come back?  
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:25:42
As of now, no news seems to be driving the a slight down turn, I’d think it’s just some profit taking, $4,500 seems to be the next wall, but I’m with the $6,000 by years end crowd. 
BTC was tested like it’s never been over the last month, we are already back to $4,300 as of now, you’re going to see a lot of up and down with the hard fork rumors flying around, I’d put in a buy on a low number just to protect yourself and go about your life, HODL!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:25:49
It’s flopping around $5675 now

No, it posts it twice in you history for some reason, I thought the same thing when I used it. 
It won’t post the coin to your account for a week or remove the money. Just keep an eye on it, but you should be fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:59:26
I’m a NO2X, but isn’t this one of the reasons why they want to fork? At this point, it’s all such a mess, I don’t know what to believe anymore. 
I’m a if it’s not broke, don’t fix it, type of person. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:13:40
May I ask why you decided to join Reddit two days ago and this is your only post, also, who the hell is selling their home to buy bitcoin, most people I know have never even heard of it, let alone own any of it. 
Wide spread media coverage, CNBC talks about it some times and it’s brief. You shorted and it didn’t payoff, I’m sorry about that, but don’t shit on everyone else who didn’t. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:28:37
No way to cancel, on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:03:27
They didn’t say a word, just as we all said, don’t ever believe these type of rumors. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:31:49
I believe it will be well above that in 5 years, if you’re looking to hold long term, unless you see a big dip coming , I mean a lot, buying now is fine, if you see BTC being $20,000 plus in 3-5 years, buying a little lower isn’t really going to make much a of a difference in the long term. 
But what can happen is, you miss the boat and cost your self money before the rise, hope this helps a little, good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:39:28
Sell a little, hodl a little, then you can either love or hate yourself, half as much?

Your fees are to low and the block chain is slammed, last night there were 40,000 backed up. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:56:26
Ya, I’m ok with that, but I will double check it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:42:51
This will explain everything you need to know in a simple way. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:32:08
Yes, higher you pay, the faster you get confirmed. If you’re in no hurry, just wait it out, otherwise you can raise your fees and you’ll get confirmed faster. 
My buddy did it last night, raised his fees after 8 hours of waiting and bingo. 
Also, as of last night, there were 40,000 unconfirmed on the block chain. I think I’m going to heat my basement with a miner at this point. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:21:54
Real investors are moving into the market, Last month shook out a lot of the panic traders, this is how you stability, it’s not always bots controlling things, BTC traders are dealing with things they’ve never seen before, real money investors. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:43:24
SCAM ALERT 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:29:33
Well, it’s looking like it should, even without the math, right now CoinBase is opening 1000’s of new accounts daily, it takes time for those people to get confirmed, think about that, they’ve added close to a million new accounts over the past few months, that’s unreal, most haven’t even begun to trade or buy and HODL, I’m still bullish and will be for a long time to come. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:50:45
GDAX, but I will buy your coin if you’re looking to see it. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:35:22

Good for you man, I hope to follow in your footsteps, in a few years.

I just bought .25, had to snap up something on this dip. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:50:10
I bought, so what’s right for you, but who’s cares if only takes 6 months, buy on the dip, it just forked and held on the lows of the day. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:41:14
I have two emails from coin base at the same time, one says they transferred it, then the other says the transferred failed to complete and I need to move it manually. 
But i log into my account and there’s zero balance in both my CoinBase wallet and GDAX account. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:27:14
One famliy from one story is what you've based this on, come on man, you could find this for anything, go out and ask 100 people about bitcoin and see what you get, I'd say you meet 0 that own coin.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:30:48
Well, no one knows that answer, it depends on where the investors go, it could split the value, $2,500 BTC
$2,500 SegX or the new coin could flop and BTC will stay the same or gain, or the miners will back the New coin and the value will move to the New coin. 
That’s what we will learn after the fork, the last fork was supposed to cause bitcoin to drop, but it didn’t, people sold of the new Bitcoin Cash coin and put it into Bitcoin Cash. 
What most are saying is to get your coin in the right place and wait for the dust to settle after the dust settles. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:52:11
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:30:28
Here, you can always grow more tulips, there’s only a set amount of BTC at 21,000,000. 
So, the tulip comparison is flawed at its very foundation, how does everyone not see this?

Google brokers in your area, private people can sell you coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:37:42
Take a look at what you just asked, you want a bunch of strangers on Reddit to predict the future for you, I don’t think BTC is right for you. 
You clearly can’t lose the investment, try something less volatile

@_date: 2017-10-20 20:27:47
I really believe the big swings are cooled at this, BTC has big money investors in it now, they’re more level headed, when the price gets good, they buy, not sell. 
People are going to have to relearn how the markets acts.

Did you read this before you posted this clickbait, no where in his testimony does he speak about Bitcoin, got out of here with your FUD, I’m sure you sold at $3,000
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:54:16
Ha! Didn’t notice, but I was worried. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:18:38
Well, then you bought it twice, it seems, sorry for the confusion on my end, but yes, if it’s showing to purchases in your history, at two different times and price, then you did buy it twice, worst case you sell it in a week if you don’t want it. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:27:31

No issues on that end. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:02:55
Wow, that’s the pot calling the kettle black, I told people the worse move they could make was to make a panic decision, that’s about it, you on the other hand posted a massive rant about how bit coin was dead, look at you username and I’m the one pushing my agenda, dude, I can go on all night with this, but yet you won’t answer any questions I pose to you, you at so upset about Bitcoin and bash it all day, but I tell people to take a deep breath and not panic sell and I’m wrong? 
I’m done with you, maybe you can remember your other password someday. But at this point, you’re ranting about nothing and being zero information to this discussion, go back under the bridge.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:45:03
I will but yours now at $150 each
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:28:13
I will try to remember, I’m happy to talk about my progress and how my style has worked out, but I’m HODL, so if it dips again, I will just buy. 
I’m interested in what BTC will be in years from now, not really a month from now, in a way. 
 keep BTC for the people. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:14:43
Vietnam is a small communist country with little to no impact on the global economy, it’s countries like it ban BTC it wouldn’t surprise anyone, controlling fiat is a major game plan of those type of governments, they’d have to ban it to keep control of the population. 
Basically it’s not anything that anyone would bat an I at, if you were to see major economy’s banning BTC you’d see a market reaction, but Vietnam isn’t one.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:50:34
Just trying to bright side it, but ya, it’s not a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:57:27

@_date: 2017-10-24 18:24:23
You’re right and wrong, that’s what the problem is, you’ll have the “old” chain that runs on a set of rules and then the “new” chain that runs on a new set of rules, so yes you can’t “update” the old chain, but people want that, they like how it runs. So they feel it doesn’t need to be undated. 
Now there’s the group that wants more transactions and bigger blocks, that’s not really a “update” it’s a whole new way of doing things. 
It’s a mess and hopefully we will get a better understanding of things, soon. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:33:02
I’m not saying it will, but a bubble means it will pop and the bottom drops out, I do believe it will correct and then go back up.

@_date: 2017-10-14 18:40:35
It’s holding above $5,700 now, $6,000 would be a breeze on Monday.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:44:42
It’s off $6,000 by $350, that’s not much, hate to break it to you, but yet again, you’re just spewing your thoughts, I’m long term anyway, a long term bear market, I sit back and let it play out, most people don’t sell on a high, it’s hard to do, but you’ve been on this sub for like a whole day, why in the world would anyone listen to what you have to say, you lied about why you’re using this user account, you can’t remember your other password, come on man, what’s the real reason you’re doing this, did bitcoin diddle you or something? 
A long term bear market is just that, slow and steady with not much movement, how do I handle that? 
Well, for one thing I don’t fucking panic and sell all my coin, that’s one thing I don’t do, you have no idea of my holdings or how I invest, one thing I do know is, all you sky is falling types never back up what you say with any graphs or math or tea leaves, it’s just your opinion. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:47:03

@_date: 2017-10-09 15:02:39
People believe that BTC is the gold standard of Alt coins, they think the hard fork might cause waves and people will retreat to BTC do to its market share of the altcoin world. 
Basically, if the Alt coin market goes whacky, BTC will be the place everyone lands, the name is safe and it has the most money behind it. 
Well, I think that’s it, but I’m just some guy on the internet.

@_date: 2017-10-22 05:16:52
Holy shit dude, you posted two days ago that you were new to BTC and you see it taking off in the future? 
But now you’re a fortune teller and it’s a bubble? Pick a side and stick with, FYI we can see your past posts, my god!!

Bitcoin is “new money” Warren buffet is “old money” he has no understanding of it what so ever and is applying stock bubble theorem to it.  
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:38:20
I think you’re mistaken on how few people already own coin, this is just gaining ground, you have thousands on new accounts being added to CoinBase daily, it takes a while for them to get cleared. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:19:30
You’re addicted to the surge, we are a few hundred off an all time high, people are going to take profit, it’s the sign of a healthy balanced market. 
If it just went up and up and up all the time, you’d be at major risk for a total collapse, small ups and downs show money going out and money going back in, you want to see this. 
When it drops 10-15% in a day, that’s a sell off
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:57:45
I think that’s Aussie dollars
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:50:32
You think it splits early? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:58:06
Change banks, that’s insane they won’t let you cut what you want that is perfectly legal. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:53:15
Good sign, Coinbase has said, they will follow the chain with the most hash, seems like core is making its move. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:34:46
Set you limit sales as needed, that’s an easy way to protect against that sort of thing, why is everyone so uneducated on how to protect themselves and investing large sums of money, we can’t babysit everyone. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:39:45
Will do, I’m always happy to talk BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:33:03
How would the US government “ban” it, exactly? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:29:35
Holy bananas, you’re kidding, right? Every Craigslist scam there is, is done with either of those, also, don’t take PayPal either. 
Use some common sense, if it’s to good to be true, it isn’t true, why would anyone give you more money then they needed too? 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:15:28
Well, watching how it’s reacted, I think it breaks $6,000, maybe $6,100ish, retracts down to the $5,850 window then does the steady match to $6,400-$6,600 and flips around there till the fork. 
It’s how it’s preformed of late and shows the numbers the numbers to back it, we are now back to flopping around $6,700, I think we push $6,000 by the weekend. 
 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:53:04
No, it means 4 hours after the fork, you’ll be able to trade it. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:33:25
Oh Jesus, I see you’re still on your throwaway account, still on you phone hours later? 
Me telling people to not make panic decisions is bad advice? Why don’t you back up anything you say with one graph, a website, even a crystal ball, oh ya, I read your bullshit posts earlier today, you back you statement with ZERO facts and lie about what account you sign in with, take your FUD sand shove it. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:42:59
It will take close to a week to post to your wallet, that’s for sure, they should have sent you an email telling you the date it will post to your account. 
If you did but twice, you’ll have two emails waiting for you. That’s the best way to figure out exactly what happened. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:25:23
It’s a healthy thing, people take profit off of highs, but ya, you’re going to have some people sell off after this fork and move back into ALTS, I feel this is pretty normal and healthy. 
I feel it starts to push back up. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:16:09
Scroll down man, people are asking all sorts of wild questions, just a PSA, not saying you are. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:37:08
I really hope this isn’t amazon, that just seems insane to me that anyone would buy into that “news” 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:06:04
No problem, good luck, NO2X
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:36:59
Interesting, people are going to flip if that’s true 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:52:42
I think the slow crawl to $6,000 before the fork 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:48:38
Personally I haven’t run into this problem, but the small amounts might just get pushed to the back of the line at the moment, are you still at zero confirms?
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:28:47
So you’re taking something that’s not written about bitcoin and then applying it to Bitcoin, do you have anything else? 
 
The last part talks about November 4th, is that 2016? I don’t think it’s wrong, I just think it’s vague and not about Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:08:39
Ya, it’s the best thing I’ve read by miles on what this fork is and how to handle it, it’s rather exciting that it could all just go to shit after, isn’t it? 
Wild times!!
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:21:06
GDAX limit buys, no charge 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:58:52
Just relax man, the worst thing you can do is panic, get some rest and revisit it with a clear head in the AM. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:49:59
Really though, it hasn’t really been talked about much at all, I think it would be more of a surprise if they did say something about it at this point. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:00:13
Based on??
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:47:20
It was a rumor weeks ago and you’re the first to bring it up again, so I’d say not at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:06:26
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:46:43
You know what I mean, anyone that has any idea what’s going to happen after the fork is just trying to push their own agenda, I think BTC will do well or could have a sell off, but I’m a NO2X, so I’m leaning toward an up swing, I don’t thing anything or anyone can stop it at this point. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:36:37
I wasn’t aware of this, who are they? I’d like to do some research.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:34:10
Just buy, it’s going to blast through $5,000
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:29:49
I work with a friend, he’s the math degree I’m the people degree, if you’d like to talk,  I’m happy too. 
I was just messing around, I didn’t think you thought that, I’m more of a dope then a moron anyway. 
Happy hunting. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:51:50
Gold Bitcoins will be next
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:43:58
I keep hearing this, but it doesn’t seem to happen. It’s a different market now, the big swings seem to be behind us. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:00:39
You need a good accountant, not a financial advisor. 
Really, get a accountant you trust, they will help you with that, even a tax lawyer,  an advisor is just going to help you move the money around, mostly. 
Don’t trust one that is giving you tax advice.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:21:36
Yes and your lottery numbers should be 46 18 38 3 25, come on man, think about that question. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:03:09
Right? It’s the base of a Ponzi scheme, who’s gaining from it? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:28:58
Yeah, this is looking more and more like CoinBase issue, we found the transfer from my wallet to CoinBase on the Blockchain, so we know CoinBase got it, now I just need to know what the hell they’ve done with it. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:54:25
Smart thinking kid, I’ve told countless people this exact thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:38:36
Whew, thank god for you. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:55:25
It’s a futures market, only places it’s trading is Brazil and Russia, from what I gather, USA market and everyone else can’t do anything with it until they announce it on November for 1st
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:46:45
Got it at $5,720, just off the lows of the day, now I’m done for a while. 
Fingers crossed
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:58:18
It was $650 a year ago
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:08:54
Short answer, no, it doesn’t matter
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:34:43
I think you over estimate how many people are into Bitcoin, it’s no where near the level of the stock market, it’s also not based on earnings, so it can’t have a bad earnings report to effect value. 
My issue is applying old world sock standards to a new world product, when is this from? I can’t find it, I did find something else from Rosenberg saying it’s a good time to invest in stocks.      
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:07:07
It’s profit taking, it flirted with $4,500, people felt the it was time to sell a little, they did and it went down. 
But if you think a $200 down turn of BTC is a crash, you’ve clearly not been watching the last month very closely at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:58:59
Look, there’s always a chance for a drop, it’s BTC, I’m sure people are playing the short here, but it all depends are your gain, the best play here is to buy more on a fall, I wouldn’t risk my coin to make a small amount. 
Because it’s soooo much worse to miss a take off, then it is the short.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:54:49
Yours in the more in-depth breakdown of what I said, there is no right or wrong answer at this point, the only wrong thing you can do is invest more money then you’re ok with losing. 
Going “all in” never crossed my mind as to a plan, god no, don’t put everything in and pray you don’t ruin your life. 
I’d never suggest that, it terrifies me that someone would do such a thing, I’m suggesting that if you think it’s going to be worth more later, then now is a good place to start as any, because we can’t go back in time. 
Thank you for the thoughtful input, I didn’t mean to come of as reckless.
