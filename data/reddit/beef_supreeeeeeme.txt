Oh, honey...
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:20:54
That's the spirit :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:01:42
Damn, that's pretty crazy...
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:35:51
Lol, if you seriously use McDonald's wifi you may as well keep your wallet.dat unencrypted in a shared folder on your desktop.

So all the medium links are 404...
Anything new happen with this?

I don't think you understand where the problem lies... you can use as many VPN's as you want, it doesn't matter. If your base connection is an unsecured, PUBLIC wireless network, you're doing it orders of magnitude beyond wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:04:31
I don't think you understand how networking works at all. 
ARP Poisoning and MITM attacks don't give two shits how many VPN's you use. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:23:04
[Yeah, okay.](
Enjoy your willful ignorance. Why the hell you would connect on an open network at all is beyond me, can you not afford internet?
Also you should look up the definition of an 'acronym' because you clearly know as much about using English as you do about networking.

This, I've had it happen with several of my addresses as well.

A bit over a hundred karma is more than most get in their lifetime? I find that hard to believe...
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:22:20
I don't think you fully understand the details around what happened. Additionally, they never proved he ordered any assassinations and it is not in his charges.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:15:08
It's all part of a conspiracy, look at all the outrageous [permission requirements!](
How dare they access publicly available information!?
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:13:07
Damn, just when I thought these stories couldn't get any more insane... This shit had best get made into a movie.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:52:58
Pretty sure you'd change your tune pretty quick if someone told you they'd harm your family/loved ones. It's been a pretty common tactic since forever.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:17:54
Apparently people didn't get your sarcasm.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:23:16
Not sure if I should downvote or upvote your response... 
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:13:50
Boy are you going to feel stupid when nothing happens on Feb. 10th! 
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:51:19
Good advice, I'd heed it.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:06:34
This needs to be higher up towards the top, he posted in this thread here ~7 hours ago:
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:25:16
It's 2017 and people are still reading Gizmodo?
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:03:19
And of course they don't list an actual source for that information. 
If this story was actually true, it'd be in the evidence in the case and they'd have brought it up.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:08:42
Fingers crossed! This case has certainly kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:21:27
Pretty sure just about every Gox customer wouldn't mind seeing him rot regardless. He screwed people pretty hard.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:58:31
Lost my shit at 360nowarrant. I'm gonna use that.

Completely disregarding the many other confusing things about your post, I'm curious as to how the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is somehow connected to LSD.
@_date: 2015-04-14 02:09:17
This is an awesome idea, great work!
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:26:32
The point stands though, regardless of the BTC-USD ratio at the time.
No reason not to secure your funds as much as possible, especially with hundreds of BTC on the line.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:47:15
That's interesting, especially considering that Bitcoin isn't even 10 years old, and, by its design, you couldn't have mined only 3 during its initial launch period anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:57:19
It's pretty heavily dependent on the size of the investment.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:07:54
Damn that's sick. I've got old 6x 750TI rigs sitting around, I'll have to spin em up.
What's your overall average hashrate with those on each coin? And got any pool recommendations? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:34:37
Oh man, I remember the ActiveMining debacle.
Had the chance to sell at a huge profit margin and made the mistake of believing in them and lost it all instead...
Hindsight is 20/20

Damn, what are you mining with GPUs that's netting you that much per month? And what GPUs are you using lol
I've still got some GPU rigs lying around that haven't been doing much.

Thank you for doing this, I just found it over there. Gonna call Paypal tomorrow, I just started the process of filing for fraud with my bank today.
BFL has the most terrible business practices of any company I have had the misfortune to interact with. I can't believe I gave them money in the first place...
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:39:35
Thanks! :D

You're assuming that people who are buying and selling illicit goods are going to go through legal/regulated routes of currency exchange. I doubt anyone would be stupid enough to use Mt. Gox to exchange their illicit profits.
The simplest way is to buy/sell bitcoins with cash locally in p2p transactions. Also there are plenty of hidden services that sell BTC without requiring ID. There are a million ways to get around having your name attached to the coins, you just have to know where to look. For example, there are lots of people who will trade BTC via moneygram/greendot/western union/etc. Then there's services like Coinfog which can help obscure transactions. 
Anonymity is still possible, it just requires a bit more effort.

They refused my request for a refund saying that now that they are shipping they will no longer refund orders. I am filing with paypal and my credit card company directly if I have to.
