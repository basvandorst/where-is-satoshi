Shouldn't this be in the sidebar or something?

Well, still sounds like the market will decide.

Of course their is a huge overlap between the Tea Party, libertarians, and anarcho-capitalists...
I think your definition of Tea Party is inaccurate and collectively paints them as all cut of the same ilk.
One end of this tea party/liberty movement is actual libertarians and voluntarists ala the 2007 Tea Party moneybomb which raised $6 million for RP in one day on Dec 16th.  That movement assisted in the election of Rand, Massie, and Amash types who are making waves.  That movement lives to this day on sites like RonPaulForums.com or DailyPaul.com or TomWoods.com or LibertyCrier.com.   No they are not interesting in electing everyone who claims to be a conservative. 
The other end of the tea party/liberty movement was organizations of the establishment who slapped the words tea party in their domain name post teaparty07.com and hailed as the right top down astroturf org you should sign up for if you're upset with the theatrics of a lawless government such as FreedomWorks, TeaPartyExpress, 9/12 projects.  Oh yea, Glenn Beck is or has a libertarian show now too....... 
They were then attacked by the left media outlets and lo and behold, the MSM heavily promoted wing of the Tea Party is a bunch of wankers.  Don't listen to anything they say.

Ancaps/voluntarists often help out on the libertarian small l projects I have worked on.
On RPF, we have been working on a blueprint of smaller government for over six years.  Many ancaps saw how this would be beneficial through at least the educational aspects of it and have assisted in many efforts.  It's kind of like taking steps off the mountain, instead of taking the cliff and hoping for the best on the back end.  That's what I've seen at least.
