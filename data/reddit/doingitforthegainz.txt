This is real financial advice folks. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:29:06
Isn't cold storage still the best option for holding?
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:52:01
Welp, no one tipped me on any of my accounts 
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:22:46
Are there other websites?
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:20:33
Guys, let's not get crazy here... They couldn't possibly make 2.7 million a day with a helpful customer support line AND segwit utilization. 
*You're asking for too much*
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:07:28
HAHAHAHA you got me there..
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:38:57
wtf am I doing wrong here?!
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:59:39
I'm back and forth on this, as a altcoin trader I want everything to rise. 
But as a bitcoin hodlr, I want it too moon. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:28:43
Oh man, you deserve gold for this. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:23:25
This guy DD's
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:23:55
And futures announcement!
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:24:29
Is there a r/wallstreetbets for bitcoin? I'd love to be a part of that sub. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:33:35


@_date: 2018-05-24 14:25:13
Where are you able to view shorts?
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:50:22
Came here to say this. Not sure why everyone is supporting RH in crypto. 
Feels like just a few months ago it was a lot of "Cold storage or Die"
Not we're all like "Screw it, let the exchange hold your crypto"
Huh. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:13:36
Not douchey enough. I need threats, deragotry terms, and copious amounts of money lost. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:09:16
Can someone tell me about owning a bitcoin ATM?
It's my understanding you need ~$10K BTC Liquidity to keep up with buying demand, and replenishing BTC to the wallet. Is there a machine that allows buys directly from an exchange, and I collect just fees? Or would I have to buy BTC on margin, if I don't have $10K in BTC? 
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:56:31
Not if you bought in before 2017
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:02:35
I had all my BTC stolen *before* it was cool. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:46:02
Yes, I change the channel pretty much whenever someone totes themselves as a "bitcoin expert" 
9/10 times it's bullshit. For the 1 time that's it's not, I'll catch it the next day on the sub. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:03:49
Average being the key word. I know a very basic amount about Crypto, and even less about blockchain but when I hear TV "Experts" talk I literally have to turn the channel. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:54:37
Hindsight is 20/20. They knew the risk, and if they didn't then they shouldn't have blindly threw money around. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:50:50
This is why I will Hodl a portion until the shit hits 0. There's good news everyday, I trade pennies, but this is my long play. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:15:24
Same, set a limit buy at 9950, thinking there was no way in hell the resistance was going to break... Whoopsie.. If it's still down tomorrow I'm in big. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:44:40
I mean, you can always set aside a % of your holdings to also make quick cash. Nothing wrong with taking profit. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:12:05
That's the market. Everyone outside of this sub preaches about the evil of volatility and the risk associated with it. If you buy bitcoin and expect to make outrageous returns day after day  you're fighting market trends. Being patient is the winners game. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:52:22
I see what you're saying. You're reffering to a "Pump and dump", basically.
 I meant more about cashing your intial investment out and allowing your profits to work for you. At least that's my strategy at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:54:01
 Where did I say I made a play? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:00:21
HEY! You didn't even mention Timmy's. What the fuck, eh? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:31:29
I've realized this is me.. I don't ever sell, but I deff don't buy. I've realized my strengths lay in determining highs. I couldn't predict a low to save my life. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:32:57
I'm more interested in this. Can someone link me an article regarding free coins?




@_date: 2018-02-01 20:58:56
I also mulled around at 19k about selling a few hundred worth and waiting for the correction but got greedy and waited too long. I don't mind bag holding though, I bought in in 2014 and have held. I'm making profit not matter what unless it hits sub 1k.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:07:47
Because I'm not "tossing my dice", so to speak. I'm content with the astronomical gains I'm gotten out of the main three. I'm gamble penny stocks. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:45:30
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:46:32
I'm telling you my dude. Try it once, it's easy. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:45:40
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:19:45
I'm well aware of the trojan floating around that changes the clipboard but this whole thread seems to be in manderin. 
Tell me how I can save my crypto
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:55:59
Do you have any resources for mining altcoins? I have a fairly decent computer sitting around not doing much. I wouldn't mind mining lower tier altcoins while it sits.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:14:53
Worthwhile and informative comment. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:10
Gdax bro. Unless you need it ASAP there's no reason to pay coinbase fee's.
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:33:21
Critics also believe something may happen, good or bad... 
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:32:25
This. As someone who bought from coinbase originally in 2014 I don't feel like they'll up and disappear overnight. 
I dislike the way they've become but they're still the most trusted. Also, it may be just habit, but I think Gdax is the cleanest and easiest to use trading platform of all the ones I've looked into. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:25:18
Best of luck to you brotha. Enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:03:34
This,  I can get behind. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:49:40
I think they're saying it's not a large enough purchase for PNC to care. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:37:15
I'm not the right person to ask about this. I was just clarifying what the above posted implied. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:39:47
It appears you're in the wrong sub my friend, you're looking for r/investing.
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:33:35
I don't think you meant to reply to me.
