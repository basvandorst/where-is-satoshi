Each state has two branches. One that takes some time and a second one that works immediately but requires a secret. If I post an old state I'm doing the former and have to wait. Meanwhile the other side should have the secret for that old state which gives access to the immediate branch which by the way, gives all the coins in the channel to the one who didn't try the old state. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:22:25
For a while. LN increases the potential utility of each onchain transaction so once all of the small stuff is moved onto LN, fees (aka security) will start to climb again. This should be accompanied by some serious price appreciation do the best insurance is conveniently to buy and hodl.

A channel is created with the maximum that can be in it, so there's no risk that it will grow larger.

They can be but the onchain fee is friction to close channels as much as on the opening side. In practice this seems to have translated into most channels being open long-term

It's an easy thing to say but hard to pinpoint. There are many ways to lose funds with Bitcoin, most of which have nothing to do with the wallet software itself. LN adds another incentive to being able to simply run secure systems.

Increasing capacity would require an onchain tx. More likely is that you'd open another channel with another node to have better redundancy.

It was 0.167 btc. Some channels have gone as high as 0.13 but none over so that limit may still be on place. People are already compiling what they're running so it's not hard to remove the limit when ready. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:56:45
Opening a channel means committing some btc to be used in it. This places an upper limit on how much can be represented by the balances in the channel. When most people open channels they will start with the entire balance pushed to one side or the other. If it's all on my side, then no more funds can be added. If it's all on the other side no more funds can be sent. Every update to the channel state is actually a transaction that could be posted to the blockchain. If you were able to withdraw more than had been committed to a channel then we'd have a way to create bitcoins out of thin air. If you try to send in a direction for which there is no capacity you just get a routing error. Hope that helps. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:39:10
You don't need consensus for this. Just cooperating nodes. It's likely that those with more capital and confidence in their security will go much bigger.

Can you explain what is meant by restricted topology?
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:39:37
Each little box is a Lightning network node. They can connect with other nodes and open payment channels (colored lines) . Once open, payment channels allow nodes to trustlessly update balances between them offchain and for very low fees. 
With a network like this a node on one side of the graph can send a payment over several hops to another node. All that's necessary is for a route to exist between the two nodes with enough capacity to carry the payment. Even with many hops, fees are small and settlement is instant.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:36:27
ATMs will very likely prefer to fund an existing channel if you have one with spare local capacity. Remember it's a network not just a single channel with whomever you are paying. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:11:23
You don't have to get it out via onchain. You can and will probably prefer to send it through the network to wherever you were thinking. If you want to keep the bitcoins in cold storage you would probably want to send the LN btc in exchange for onchain btc sent to your cold storage.

This guy was born. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:13:32
It's trivial for your node to have some designated place to send excess funds. What's kind of implausible is a counterparty wanting to add so much to a channel with you when you have a much lower max preference. You can enforce overpayment at the protocol level here and in your example you make it something that requires funds to be somewhat stuck (I'm assuming you don't have other 1 btc channels open with other parties).

@_date: 2018-01-18 17:39:11
Each channel can be closed cooperatively or non-cooperatively but I don't believe channel modification has been implemented anywhere. If that happens, it will likely have the same cooperative/non-cooperative modes where if other part misbehaves, you can take all of the money. If you don't want people opening channels and sending you money, then you can not run a public node. Opening a channel, after all, requires direct communication with the counterparty's node.
I'm curious, what is your use case? It sounds similar to low-limit credit card or a limited gift card.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:41:15
No, what's most likely is the payment processors first payment to you if you don't already have capacity will be onchain to setup a channel with your side having all of the sats for one or wait a week and two paychecks. You can then spend directly from the channel. If do want to make capacity in that channel, maybe it's several paychecks in size, then you send the coin to another channel or someone who will exchange LN btc for onchain.

It's a payment request. Give it to your lightning node and it will find a route and push satoshis from channel to channel until they arrive at the destination. You can always close a channel but you'd really on ly do that if you want to send the money to cold storage or to someone who isn't on lightning yet.

If we assume the hash rate is such that blocks occur on average every 10 minutes, then 15/6 = 2.5 minutes average per block. The chances are 25% that a block can be found within 2.5 minutes on average so 1:4. Doing that 6 times in a row is 1 in 4^6 or 1:4096.  Should happen about once a month, preferably under a full moon.

If you make a payment just once with a vendor, make it a payment channel with all of the funds pushed to them. Then if they or anyone else needs to pay you, you can use that channel to receive up to that amount.

It's unlikely anyone will want to close a channel because they should be able to send funds better and faster back through the network. This lock/unlock terminology isn't great because funds are kind of super-powered when committed to channels with well connected nodes. The one case I could see for onchain is to send done funds to cold storage.

It's either of financial interest, or isn't, to spoil one's trust with you. Selective scamming is a thing; but if you're careful you can reduce your risk greatly. Check for complaints or enjoy a perk of being in the community.

It is very much of a natural progression. Dimon has gone from nocoiner to shitcoiner.

Anti-vaxxers have come up with a number of arguments, memes, and stories that appeal to a large number of people while simultaneously being the opposite of what history, science, and medicine have found over more than a century. That and many institutions have abused the public trust so people are more vulnerable to pseudoscientific and sensationalist arguments. It's weird because I don't really see what those who pushed anti-vax had to gain, but here we are.

Several wallets use sats, especially the lightning-supporting ones. Maybe lightning is the new sats frontier.


Yeah, we'll get there but it's going to be from more new hodlers who see the value proposition of money they actually control. Not because some of us moved the decimal place.

He's trying to discourage you saying this is a bad time which is unnecessary bias to add. Honestly 1% is pretty good as fees go.
@_date: 2019-04-29 18:25:29
And the total fees were like 2 cents per participant.

If you need a node with the uptime and connectivity of a datacenter then you should insist on bare metal. Otherwise raspberry pi it or run on a computer under your physical control. Be careful storing any funds on a vps.

Nobody in their right mind uses one site as their source of information. Do you not agree that one should research as many sources as necessary until they feel they are getting to some idea of the truth? Or should you follow someone completely and parrot their crafted phrasings?

I googled that. Really opened my eyes.

You seem to think we live at the government's pleasure. It's the other way around.

Then you have a couple/few other services do this to your node as well and you start to have a pretty robust connection to the network.

$100 is about 2% fee. This is on the lower end overall if you count cash and atm methods.

Except that it's nearly impossible to take this man seriously. The only one he looks good to is whomever throws their money away by supporting him.

Banks pay to elect the politicians and monitor their voting once in office. Banks can't claim to be victims. There's an ebb and flow here but Bitcoin helps break the cycle. Now regular citizens can buy politicians too.

Can you explain how escrow works with Lightning? Is there multisig escrow or is it custodial?

Another post says yes. Not that big of a deal to wasabify them coins if you want your privacy back.

Neither handles spare change which is a unique use case of a small amount of money. Gives a way to convert money they weren't really counting on into another savings vehicle.

The other lightning toy platforms have taught us that charging a small fee to post only keeps the lowest level of mass spam off the platform.
What would be cool is if editors could be paid easily and automatically for posting quality content.

It's hard to understand how three relatively decent people went so wrong. Maybe they got overextended and had to get out of a hole.

That just sounds like invoices with extra steps. Typically the merchant wants to reduce the number of steps a customer must do to make a purchase. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:21:16
Lineage can always be traced to a point. As they said in the article this is an adjustment to reduce what was a telltale pattern for ricochet. So it makes figuring out what's really happening a bit harder. Put enough of these types of improvements together and that coin lineage can be obscured to whatever level the sender wants.

Bitfury is a cool name.

False but also unprovable. At some point - maybe even already - there will be nobody who understands how Bitcoin works. Even you. 


Dont underestimate me.


Worthless comment. We all know this.


Its also not a silver bullet. Anything else it isn't that you wanted to share? 


The comment was worse, it's actually of negative value to me. I should stop trying to educate my competition. The earth is alive?


Sometimes it's not addition but a highlight that is one's purpose.
Finally, Why did you ask these questions if you already know the answers? It would have been better to just say a ricochet is whatever you think it is. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 07:25:48
I don't know. It takes time. Some of them were probably bored.

I don't think activities that appear to split/weaken Bitcoin is an important role but maybe I'm missing some long con they're into.

It's an improvement and I know this was more of a fun holiday project but you'll get a ton more usage with a bit more explanation and an example or two.
I've never run rust so what do I need to do to run these on Windows/Linux?

Nobody cares more about your money than you. Evidently they can't or don't want to teach you about finance. In a few years, you will learn tons and be on your way to way better financial decisions than if you never held.

It seems everyone is government property there but I don't believe it. The next revolution is definitely going to be epic.

While the Bitcoin codebase could conceivably have one, the concern is more at the operating system and hardware level.

There is no consensus requirement for LN. If a node wants to be economically useful it'll upgrade to keep up with the latest protocols.

The Bitcoin wiki and please don't call them nocoiners if they want to learn. Besides being name-calling it's reserved for those who willfully won't learn about or deal in bitcoin.

Another reason. The earlier the request the less closely you're tied to this revolutionary concept called wanting to control your own money. Act now and maybe it's, you just learned that you could hodl it yourself.

If it's a bank run then exchanges and wallets like Coinbase are banks. Why would we trust them to that level? Do they give loans (even to themselves) when they're not supposed to? Is there insurance?
If all is as they say, on the 3rd there will be no other consequence than that users hold more of their coins which can only be a positive thing.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:59:16
Yes, more if you can. Honestly wish I had worked harder before to buy more then just held. No alts. No loans. No leverage. Just sweet holding.

Why is pissing off gold bugs a good strategy? These seem like better people to educate and encourage rather than to antagonize. More time and money wasted including admittedly this comment right now.
@_date: 2018-12-22 18:46:39
It's not about causing shorts to do anything. It's all about educating people that they can and should hold their own coins.
