It would be amazing if you could get your change from purchases in these stores in Bitcoin.

ChangeTip was the best! But you can't expect it to work anymore when transaction fees are so high. I sent $30 worth and transaction fee was $8. :(

How do you know? How do you know it will be a failure? Did you try it? Why suppress a different vision? Especially if it can be so impactful. All I want is a useable store of value. Is it really that hard? Keep it simple.

I don't think Roger Ver cares about being a billionaire and never have to work anymore. He has a bigger vision than that man, see the big picture where we are going here. Frictionless peer-to-peer transactions. Ie. LOW FEES. $12 transaction fees are not peer-to-peer electronic money. how can we help the poorest people on earth, when our transaction fees are $12

I don't buy Bitcoin in hopes of becoming rich. I just want to be able to buy groceries with it and transact peer-to-peer. Then i can retire using escape velocity.

or... we (the users) are not content with high transaction fees and we (the users) are moving to a crypto that works as intended

Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin
