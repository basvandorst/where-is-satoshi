Does this mean PayPal is literally Hitler?

I live in Texas, but I'd rather buy a Mel B album.

The titles aren't as sensationalist as I thought they would be.

Nope. It's silver, so it's a Litecoin.

Well I asked because it took more than a day from when it was sent. I've never had a transaction so slow before. I know transactions without miner's fees will take a while though, but this one had a fee.

I'm pretty sure it's based on a formula where you won't be able to buy or sell if the price fluctuates by over X%.

Their third party payment processors stopped payments. It wasn't a decision on BTC China's part. That is what has been said to the media so far.

He tweeted it once a few weeks ago. He mentioned BTC, LTC, and QRK in same tweet. Too lazy to search though.

I'm not understanding what you are trying to say.

This "corroborates" the $80k hit he thought he placed. Pretty interesting read. It seemed like this guy thought it was a TV show or a game.

Thank you. I was wanting to figure out how to do this. I have bookmarked it for when I wake up :)

Anyway you can verify you were apart of the dev team? Thanks.

It was an accident. It wasn't an address of someone associated with theverge.com. It was from a redditor who made a joke and edited the original and "enhanced" it so you could easily scan the QR code. Relax :)
Although, pretty bad research, but they weren't trying to get over on anyone.

I honestly wouldn't doubt it. I wish the financial world had more honesty in it.. I think I do.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:50:29
Why now?
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:19:34
It's because they understand that it's not a big deal, but we think it is because we have a guy on bloomberg posting a sensationalist title that did not explain his story at all.

I think it should be ??? for step # infinity because they will not be heard from ever again.

You mean like every politician? There are no "my word is my bond" people in politics.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:59:24
He is saying the government hasn't officially said that so he can't speculate on it.

The biggest thing that gives him away is that most senior citizens I know are very slow at typing, and have typically poor typing abilities. (Because I somehow know a lot of senior citizens?? Just anecdotal lol)

I think it was because of the December 5th announcement though. I know the fees went up a little later, but it was kinda cloudy to BTC exchanges since it would be more difficult to do transactions onto their sites. I think the ethical thing to do would be to not charge anything for withdrawals as long as you cannot deposit. I understand why they would charge though since this will possibly be their last chance to make any money from BTC if they can't get a way to deposit.

Bills have been introduced because people at twoplustwo and the Poker Player's Alliance have had people tweeting, e-mailing, and messaging their congressmen as much as possible. They have actually got something done. Having a bill introduced is a big step, and a few states have decided to legalize it on their own. The pressure is rising.
