@_date: 2014-09-22 19:10:21
As Bitcoins become harder and harder to mine, is the "worth" of the mined coin set to increase?
As in, if computation ability doesn't map to difficulty closely enough, is there some fluctuation in the codebase to say "this is getting really hard now, this should be rewarded more highly" or is it more "this is getting really computationally difficult, we should allow for a wider spread of mined results, but keep the value pegged to the same number of Bitcoins"?
I'm not sure how clear that question is...
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:14:07
This is really helpful, thanks. I assume multiple verifications are needed before the account is credited?
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:47:29
There's different types of credit, and if you have a genuine positive balance with the bank, there is more they can do with it. For example, creating new money through new lending.
Rich people, and companies, don't get rich by allowing any amount of money to walk out the door. You take your money, your future custom, your credit, your word-of-mouth, your internet opinion, etc etc with you.
Also, it's probably not reflected well on the commission of the poor soul working behind the desk when you close the account. They have a vested interest in finding out why you're leaving, and working out how to make you stay. Anything outside their power will become a statistic and work its way up the chain.
Again, if the affect is minimal, it can be considered acceptable loss. But it's not a trivial thing, and will be considered at some level other than just the account balance.

@_date: 2014-10-14 00:04:00
That wasn't the point.
The argument was, can code replicate data with enough detail to be confused for real data, fast enough to be comparable to multiple users worth of real data. Yes, it can.
If money really is available, these methods will scrape it up.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:30:18
Inform the bank in very clear terms, so they can use it for their statistics, why the decision is being made to close the account.
This way they can see the affect (however minimal) on their bottom line.

@_date: 2014-09-22 13:55:58
I'm not sure if I'm getting this right:
An algorithm does math, and finds a magic number which conforms to a magic math rule, and it's declared that a Bitcoin has been mined.
How does the system know this has happened?
And how does this event create wealth in the hands of the person who can the code to find the magic number?
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:05:15
I didn't realise the difficulty was built into the algorithm, I guess enough people have looked at this now to ensure all the loopholes are closed. 
I've had some (fractions of ) Bitcoins for nearly a year now, always good to know more about how it all works.
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:14:06
Great, thanks, this is very clear.
With so many people mining, isn't it plausible that 2 miners find the magic number within a short space of time, so there are multiple claims to the same coin? I assume all the blockchain holders must have their system clocks seriously closely synced up.
@_date: 2014-09-22 15:23:04
This is really good, I appreciate the detail. I didn't realise the difficulty was adjustable. I assume there's a set of immortals out there who decide when this needs to be cranked up a notch? That would suck if you'd just mined a coin, but it turns out the difficulty changed so it's no longer valid.

Interesting. In terms of currencies, how do you define the usage of the word 'strong'?

USD is its own special case, as it's the world currency that all else is compared to, and people ignore whatever is actually happening in the US with respect to capital. Even when the US failed to sort out a budget, nothing really substantial happened to the markets.
It's down to perceived trust in paying debts, and we all assume that the US will never default on a loan. Or at least, if it does, everyone else has been fucked for ages.
For GBP, I'm not sure of any other currencies which can compare to be approximately evenly.

People spread fear to further their own agenda. Some want the price to drop so they can buy, some just bought and want it to go up.

I should be able to run my own private services, for my own use, without someone telling me that I am suddenly considered a commercial operation.

I was just thinking the same thing. A stable exchange rate does allow for people to actually spend a bit, rather than sitting on it hoping for a "to the moon" event to occur.
I can't see why people would buy in at a higher rate while crashes are so frequent, unless they're investing rather than using it as an online currency.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:17:28
Somewhere along the line, they either didn't understand what they were doing, or were lied to. Bitcoin has never been described as risk free.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:16:09
The idea is to make the currency move about. The retailer doesn't care about the success of bitcoin, they are only going to be attracted by the new customers and lower transaction fees.
It's up to the bitcoin holders and exchanges to absorb the losses of whatever new service/payment they're offering.

This is always true. When you buy petrol/gas, the (pre-tax) price is largely due to the dollar price of fuel on the global market. All fungible commodities will be pegged to exchange rates, regardless of the currency you're using to buy them.

I basically agree, with some stipulations.
1, you can't just sit and watch them. You have to spend them. Not all, but enough to maintain confidence in both the buyers and the retailers.
2, "fortune" implies, to me, an element of luck. You have to work for it. In this case, it's spreading the knowledge of bitcoin, increasing confidence, increasing the spending power through sales, and calming the panic of confused newcomers - again by increasing knowledge and confidence.
