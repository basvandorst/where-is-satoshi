This is only true if other transactions are unknown. Once there's a link to you and your wallet(s), you're now identifiable.

Bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. The IRS, specifically, is using  for tracking where thing are moving.

This sounds similar to how a correspondent banking system functions. Money is moved between accounts but money isn't necessarily exchanged  between banks. Is that about right?

I'd be surprised if they do cycle on/off like that - energy price swing would need to be enormous.
Anyone investing in capital intensive hardware has fixed costs for rent, facilities and depreciation. Increasing difficulty is another DoF which puts a very real expiration date on your hardware.
Generally, I'm skeptical of on-demand mining's commercial viability. Over-fencing as is done in China makes sense (and is an extremely common practice in other industries).

Reddit is a great example as to why you shouldn't assume you're anonymous. As soon as a bit of information leaks out, your entire post history is linked to you.
The problem is that Bitcoin won't leak that information, it's where you buy shit from (or who sends you coins).
Better not to assume you're anonymous. I mean, maybe if you never buy anything, never sell. But in that case, the IRS doesn't care.
Here's on write-up on the subject.

Maybe here is where we disconnect. That's not the end of the story. A bank is just an entity, not a person and its not lending its own money. Bank lost other people's money? Start another bank. If we know anything, its that people (masses of people) aren't very smart. Institutions can do shitty things but people will continue supporting - even if out of complacency.


Why not? Debt products have been creeping into trading platforms and P2P debt with bitcoin already exists (although nothing truly unique/new). We can't exactly stop someone from trying to turn a profit off a product and there's nothing about Bitcoin that prevents debt.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:54:25


The need for a bail out (voluntary or otherwise), as I see it, is a symptom and not the problem. That's why I say there's nothing about Bitcoin that stops  people from doing what they're doing now with traditional currency, putting their trust in third parties (banks).
Bitcoin addresses the monetary policy issues of allowing a magic money injection to bail out an institution but it doesn't prevent a profit-driven institution from getting to a point where a bail-out is needed to remain solvent.
The best we can do, right now, is tell people to hold their own keys. But we're trusting people to do that and I don't have a lot of that trust for everyone.

Why do you feel that you had no responsibility in the 2008 economic recession? Presuming you held USD - do you feel like you did not take responsibility for keeping your wealth in USD? (I'm asking because that seems like it would be your position)


In a fractional-reserve situation, who is going to force the persons giving bad loans to take responsibility? What would taking responsibility for making bad loans even look like? It certainly could be through legal action but that's not a Bitcoin feature, that's how the current system works.


You can't back out of a transaction, but once debt is involved (and at mass adoption, it certainly will be), there is the option to default (break the deal). If you loan me 1000BTC, you're trusting me to pay you back. If I renege (maybe my business failed for whatever reason), you can't force a transaction from my wallet to yours. Bitcoin isn't the thing holding me responsible.
The status quo would be reneging on debt in USD and having wages garnished (forced to pay back creditor). I wouldn't call that a feature of USD but part of the US legal system.


And that is the 21 million BTC question. I don't believe BTC resolves this but I'm hopeful there's innovation with respect to cryptocurrency and debt that makes traditional lending obsolete.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:39:32
So, I hadn't realized you had funds in Mt. Gox - that sucks.
As I interpret what your post - you are personally responsible for keeping your funds in Mt. Gox but as I see it, Bitcoin didn't force you to take responsibility. Bitcoin doesn't force anyone to do anything (which I'd call a feature).


I agree with this, but to go back to the root of our conversation


I don't see it as Bitcoin holding an individual/institution responsible.  If someone decided to put their money in SuperSketchyBank and said institution goes insolvent - its not the currency (any flavor, Bitcoin, USD, simoleons, etc.) holding them responsible, it was their decision that makes them responsible. Weather or not that individual takes responsibility instead of blaming others is on them, however.


As you can imagine, this is part of why I don't trust individual users at mass adoption. If early adopters will act irrationally, there's no reason to believe a less committed person would be just the same. The silver lining, for now, is the community tries to inoculate against panic selling by encouraging against such behavior (even if its mostly memes).


If you caused my losses (taking at face value that this is possible), Bitcoin doesn't have any mechanism to force you to take responsibility (if there was, we'd have much bigger problems). I think that gets into a very different subject, for another time, however.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:48:44


Yes, this is otherwise known as a bank run. What was described in the comment you responded to is fractional-reserve banking which is currently how banks provide loans.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:21:50


Most manufacturers don't want to be in the business of distribution/marketing/sales. These payment terms are basically lubricant and can be very sophisticated. Those working capital loans/facilities enable seasonal businesses that need to fund day-to-day operations (lots of consumer stuff, but also essentials like agriculture, durable goods, construction).
Another loan flavor.... Some construction parts companies have shipping containers full of parts that are dropped on site. When the project is done, the container is taken back and inventoried. Any parts used then get billed to the site. It's way cheaper to operate this way because the cost of delay is so high but effectively, they're loaning out a fair bit before even getting to an invoice with payment terms...
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:10:55
So I've been noodling about this, on/off, for the last few hours.
In what way are you responsible for Mt. Gox? I've been trying to put myself in your shoes to answer that but I suspect your take is more interesting.
I feel confident in taking responsibility for my own actions but I do not feel it necessary to force you to be or take responsibility for my actions. For you/me, this isn't an issue but with mass adoption we could see familiar financial instability that would have otherwise been avoided if people didn't place trust where they probably shouldn't.
If the mere act of holding Bitcoin (in any medium) is taking responsibility, I don't think that's a Bitcoin holding you responsible - you are responsible for holding RMB or USD or EUR etc. over some other asset or equity you feel best for your situation.


That small nuance is pretty fascinating to me.  I don't want to imply that I have a particular solution or know what's best. When I look at this from a high level, there are some opportunities around debt that are not resolved but could be unfortunately filled with more traditional banking practices (not necessarily now, but with mass adoption).
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:32:44
100% agree - but that's not a requirement for a fractional-reserve banking system. What you described is one solution to deal with  untrustworthy parties in a transaction that requires trust.
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:18:29


While I don't keep my crypto holdings in a bank (not your key, not your coin), I do keep my USD holdings in a bank (not your coins, not your coin?). Shit, I keep a safety deposit box for my crypto because I don't trust myself or my neighbors enough to not to burn my building down while making toast.
As adoption reaches critical mass, I think we'll see more bank-like institutions. They'll sell the idea of trust (because trust is why people use banks and what people know about currency) and they'll drive the point home that the average person is very likely to lose their private key(s). I don't necessarily agree with that path, but there's nothing to stop it (technically, perhaps legally).
To drive it home.... Using a bank, stupid or not, doesn't change that Bitcoin changes the game with respect to monetary policy.
e: I word worded
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:32:58


I agree - the only reason I posted in this thread is because fractional-reserve banking is cited as "why Bitcoin was even created." There's no need for rose colored lenses - Bitcoin is great but it doesn't solve or even address that issue.


I don't see the profit part as a problem, it's more going back to what you wrote earlier - individuals need to take responsibility. I don't share that level of trust that individuals will take responsibility.
I agree a bail-out doesn't need to happen (my statement was that bail out would be needed to stay solvent), that doesn't mean there's zero impact on the currency. My. Gox saw no bail out (good) and the market responded as one might expect (lots of panic selling) - we all "suffered" someone else's irresponsibility.
If it's not obvious, I do agree that we're in agreement - I'm not attacking your position. It's sometimes difficult to find level headed conversation on this subject.
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:57:26


From an operational point of view, I don't think bitcoin holds a fractional-reserve institution responsible for bad behavior. If a bank make sketchy loans or doesn't hold enough in reserve or has poor security... Basically, if a bank breaks their trust and goes insolvent and can't pay out. Who holds the bank of bitcoin responsible?
My position isn't that banks are necessarily a good idea - I see them as inevitable with mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:00:57
First, I appreciate your comment. I may respond out of order...


100% Agree. So long as we **all** hold the line, this will be true. We could do the same for fiat currency too - so long as everyone holds all of their cash in their physical wallet, banks can't fractionally reserve. A bit of a prisoner's dilemma.
My point is that Bitcoin does not address fractional-reserve banking, the users of Bitcoin must. That's putting a lot of trust into mid and late adopters who may understand Bitcoin just as much as they understand yesterday's currency which you mentioned here:


I believe there will always be a group of people that don't understand how their money or its monetary policy works. I also believe this will group will be a majority or plurality of users for any currency with mass adoptions. I wish it wasn't so, but there's nothing about Bitcoin that stops the uninformed from using it.
Bitcoin affords the option for digital transactions without a third party and without trust. Bitcoin does not remove or exclude the option to use a third party whom you believe to be trustworthy. There is literally nothing stopping someone from making a bitcoin deposit into a bank that will accept it.


I think this is true for the scenario you've laid out but I don't think this is how it will play out without some cataclysmic global financial event that wipes the slate clean. People are already using bitcoin debit cards and in a landscape with competitive currencies, such a service makes adoption easier and if VISA decides they want to integrate native bitcoin, this is going to accelerate Bitcoin's use within a traditional finance environment (sans traditional monetary policy).
We should never underestimate people's willingness to give up something for convenience (how many people keep their coins on an exchange?).


If you can grant me a moment to be an ass (playfully).... I'm not sure how the FR Act of 1913 used Great Depression propaganda 16 years before the Great Depression started but I need that time machine to tell myself (I'll tell you too): 2009, mine Bitcoin.

An arbitrage move would be executed by simultaneously buying and selling. You'd need to be positioned in both markets before the arbitrage opportunity presents itself.

I think you may misunderstand fractional-reserve banking... You don't need to loan more than the deposits, you need to loan deposit *liabilities.* That's why its called fractional-reserve, you only hold a fraction of your deposit liabilities.
As an example: A bank with 100 customers deposits 1BTC each (total 100) - each person sends their money to the bank's wallet(s). The bank extends 40BTC in a loan. The bank's deposit liability is 100BTC, but they're only able to fulfill 60BTC (60%) until their 40BTC in loan principle is repaid. We now how 100 people with claim to 1BTC each and 1 person holding 40BTC - no coins created (but more supply).
Things go tits up if there's a bank run but that's not a Bitcoin problem, that's a bank problem. The bitcoin feature (?) is that there's no omnipotent power to create more coins for the bank to become solvent again - the bank would need to find a lender to restore solvency (did you ever see It's a Wonder Life? The back-story is basically a little bank/CU trying to avoid being acquired by Mr. Potter, the big bank).
Bitcoin allows digital transactions without the need for a third party but **it does not exclude the use of a third party** if one is available and people chose to use it. There's literally nothing stopping anyone from sending bitcoin to a bank that will accept it. (sorry for emphasis, I don't mean it aggressively, but I just realized this is an important point that doesn't come up in these discussions)
Its not my recommendation to trust a third party but I see it happening as bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) reaches mass adoption.
(sorry for the long post)
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:00:27


That's more of an issue of credit/loans than Bitcoin (or any currency). The lender takes on risk by trusting the lendee(s) will repay - the lender's reward is interest. I call it an opportunity because its a nontrivial problem to solve.
That said, bankruptcy is a legal status - what jurisdiction applies? Will it even be possible to discharge loans and on who's authority? I don't have an answer, but it will be an exciting day when we find out.
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:38:50


There's no reason to believe each customer must have their own wallet held by a bank. You might not use such a bank, you're an early adopter and know better. Bitcoin doesn't address fractional-reserve banking so when we're beyond early adopters and reach mass appeal, problems with fractional-reserve banking issues can resurface.


I agree. While insolvency would be bad for a bank's creditors/clients, the inability to create new coins to "make the bank solvent" is what bitcoin does (that's the monetary policy issue bitcoin addresses).
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:27:16
I'm hoping a P2P lending mechanism takes hold before traditional lending. There are still big hurdles with respect to things like credit worthiness and I'd bet my last bitcoin multiple parties are working on that right now.


Agreed, but that's not a feature of bitcoin (nor a bug). You could swap bitcoin for USD and the sentiment still holds true
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:37:23
Bitcoin doesn't provide an alternative to fractional-reserve banking. There's nothing stopping a hypothetical "Bank of Bitcoin" that uses client deposits to provide credit/loans.
I believe there's a huge opportunity for Bitcoin/crypto: How do you extend credit, a transaction requiring trust, in a system designed to be trustless? 
Bitcoin addresses (but I hesitate to say "solves" as that's a matter of opinion) certain monetary policy issues. That is to say, there's a  difference between fiat currency and fractional-reserve banking.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:51:57
Hell yes, I'm on board.


On board until that part. If society is going wrong, Bitcoin won't stop them from doing the same thing they're doing now (for the most part). I can't force you or anyone else to keep your money out of any institution - and that's a feature.
Hilariously, governments may be the one to force us NOT to have fractional-reserve banking with bitcoin.
I'm hopeful that a better lending solution takes root before we get to the point of "traditional" banking/loans. I don't know what that solution is (P2P, ???) but the thought is exciting.
