The current financial system sucks and is based on fear and violence. People want out
@_date: 2019-11-28 05:49:12
If you understand bitcoin, it is your duty to tell people who want to know more.
Whether they question the current system or understand that it is time to exit and why...they may not know enough about Bitcoin to start migrating away. Share what you know!
It may save them from serious harm.

The people pushing dependency on the current financial power system want you to believe Bitcoin is not better than reliance on them.
However, if you simply consider money that no one can TAKE from you and the lack of living in fear of that violent act of confiscation... Bitcoin clearly fixes several shortcomings of the old system.

When so many people don't understand bitcoin or what it means to humanity or understand what problem it solves for the first time in history...some of us need to be passionate about it.
Do you think the American founding fathers weren't fanatical after exhausting every option with the British crown? 
There is no Choice, the current system doesn't work anymore and people are too terrified to admit it or say it out loud.

Omg, you are quoting one guy, Matt Ahlborg who runs usefultulips!  The entire article is about how bitcoin and cash are being hoarded.  "Pro traders" don't use localbitcoin!

You fail to grasp that violence is what backs fiat. That violence is the only value it holds. There is no way to prevent confiscation of assets other than crypto. You don't have equal force to the people who want to confiscate. They rule by fear. 
That is why fiat is obsolete. There is another option and no one wants to live in fear. It is over.

You sir are highly misinformed
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:48:46
No, you can choose NOT to give up crypto regardless of violence.
You cannot prevent someone from killing you and taking other assets.
You must give someone your crypto, it is a choice. The threat of violence is coercive but does not take away that choice in the end.
For the first time in human history, might does not make right.
@_date: 2019-10-07 03:58:30
Maybe I should simplify this answer further...
One man giving into fear, does not change the reality that he had a choice to hand over his assets. 
That means money is now an individual human right, not a privilege.
Case in point Hong Kong:

You misread that. People are trying to get cash and bitcoin...and get out of banks for fear the govt is tracking their bank accounts to identify the protestors
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:03:30
Good news, your comment is very wrong...
Most Americans want out of the current system...they just don't understand economics enough to know that socialism is the old failed forerunner of capitalism.
Changes to economics for an asset that cannot be corrupted and confiscated by government are hard to explain...but it will happen

I am moving money to one this morning. BofA has gone too far
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:55:25
Another associate on the phone said they didn't have documentation. So, I am pressing the issue.
Credit cards...ok  I can see an exposure argument. Debit Cards and Checking Accounts is just illegal.
Ok found something they can send me!
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:32:07
I tried both
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:45:54
Hmm, will need to  investigate that.
We all know the actual value of bitcoin is more than 15 times the manipulated market price, but I stay with the legit, above board companies.
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:36:22
So, to right this injustice several of us need to gather information.
We need analysis showing the bank using funds to finance the shorting of bitcoin futures. 
The policy documentation, I can take care of.
BofA shows no records when they deny the coinbase transactions. Unlike normal denials, they know this is illegal. I was on the phone with BofA while attempting a transaction and their systems did not show anything. Other users need to attempt the same transaction.
We need confirmation that the system at Coinbase was not in error.
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:29:03
I am getting this is writing. It is time to bring a criminal case and class action. I will post a copy here
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:39:54
I know, this shows collusion to use unfair trade practices against a competitor as a group of businesses.
This policy is another document that we need
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:14:45
My first transaction worked also, from a business account. Then it was blocked.
Last night I tried from a personal account and they locked my debit card for suspicious activity.
This is about market manipulation, so the timing of your purchases is important. Try a small buy today.
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:46:41
Read up on why Anti Competitive practices are illegal.
This is a "per se" violation
Typical examples, price fixing, market division, bid rigging, group boycotting
"Rule of reason" also applies here
Examples, monopolies, tying, exclusive dealings and price discrimination

I just got off the phone with James at BofA Business accounts. He told me that BofA policy does not allow any purchase of bitcoin from any type of account.
Not your checking, not credit, nothing. Absolutely a violation of the Sherman AntiTrust Act.
