Some authors are very insistent about wanting to only be known by their writing and not their speaking or even their physical appearance. He is apparently one of them. I think the same goes for musicians who only want their music to speak for them. Then there are actors who are the same about their acting (I think the most famous example is Jack Nicholson, who has notoriously avoided talk shows for his entire career).

I think the word "crash" is the most overused and misused word in both reports and forecasts about Bitcoin. How about saying "dip," "fall," "drop," or "slide" instead? I think that "crashing" has only been appropriate when it fell *50%* 3 times, from Nov 2013 to Feb 2014.

Here's my theory about Bitcoin: There are so many individuals and groups of individuals, plenty of whom I believe are even in junior high and high school (after all, Bitcoin can used on Xbox games), who are constantly doing things to enrich themselves via Bitcoin, and whenever you see the price jump, that's because a bunch of those people all did something at once. And it will only EVER keep climbing, year after year, because of those people. It started this year at $963, and yesterday, the last day of November, it hit $11,517. At its current rate, if the past 11 months are any indication, it will obviously reach about $12,517 this month, and I see it going above $13,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:34:52
I disagree. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:54:32
I'd define a crash as a 50% drop or more, and I say absolutely NOT. It is a whole new paradigm. Watch this video to see the kind of faith that certain very powerful tech figures are putting into the blockchain - goddammit, it was removed - well, the links in comments show that both Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen are huge believers in the technology:

I see extremely slower growth. I am a huge proponent of Bitcoin, but I'd say that if it's still around in December 2018 as we know and use it today, it'll be around $700. $5,000 by December 2018 is incredibly, extraordinarily optimistic. The level of adoption and use would be high enough to make it comparably as mainstream as having a smartphone in 2010, or having a Facebook account in America in 2011 (the IPO was May 2012).

Who exactly calls an echo chamber? That sounds like quite a strawman you just set up. From what I've seen from a few years of activity here, is that it's one of the most argumentative subreddits around. Users of Bitcoin and even strong proponents of Bitcoin are very critical-thinking and opinionated (and not just opinionated in the sense of thinking that Bitcoin will replace all fiat currency in 10 years or whatever), and the subreddit is thoroughly filled will commenters who are tamping down or even extensively rebutting the pro-Bitcoin or simply Bitcoin-related statements, predictions, or advice from others--and that includes in response to whole articles posted here from ardent "believers."

I very respectfully disagree with the pronouncements with this whole "near guarantee;" I ABSOLUTELY guarantee that what you describe here WON'T happen:


I saw naysayers just laughing at Bitcoin yesterday, about how it "crashed" from $11,500 to $10,000 and below. How overused is the word "crash" in reference of Bitcoin? I mean, there's "dip," "fall," "drop," and "slide," but I think that "crashing" has only been appropriate once thus far, and was in December 2013, when it went from the $1100 range to the $500 range.

I believe that fiat currencies are much more important and will be the primary currency on the planet and any system that tries to subvert all regulation will likely be a niche system or be a dominant system in the less than legal part of the economic ecosystem. So the really exciting thing about Bitcoin isn't Bitcoin but the underpinnings of Bitcoin, which is the Blockchain. One of the things that bugs me a lot about our financial system is at least 80% of all profits generated by the financial ecosystem are worthless for society hacks to make profits without adding any value (generally talking about derivatives, HFT, fixed-income trading, and many other obscure financial transactions which are used to make legal but unethical or at least socially non-beneficial profits).
So the Blockchain is extremely valuable in disrupting much of the less valuable parts of the financial system and in making the more valuable parts of the system much more efficient, transparent, and accessible. Simple things like land registry and title insurance, escrow services, systems of record, authentication of documents, are first generation Blockchain applications that will enable even more complex Blockchain applications in second and third generation systems built on the first generation features and facilities that are enabled to dramatically reduce the cost and improve the level of services (my dream would be that the financial sector is less than 5% of the profits of all business in this country, not one of the most profitable segments, because the business of servicing business which is what the financial services is, shouldn't make more money than all the businesses that generate real services that end users consume like cars, movies, medical services and the like). The Blockchain can get us started on that path.

Business of servicing business which is what the financial services is, shouldn't make more money than all the businesses that generate real services that end users consume like cars, movies, medical services and the like.
Why do they(finanicial institutions) even earn so much more profit now?

blockchain technology is starting to be applied to new applications.  one online voting system company has adopted this as their foundational technology.  I have also proposed that we treat each individual vote as a "transaction" which gets recorded in the large network of blockchains -- for both transparency and security.

Coincidental editorial from yesterday:
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:21:49


From what I see, the commenters and comment-voters here, whom I assume are virtually all subscribers and frequent followers, are generally smart and strong-opinioned people--I mean, just consider who would follow a text-based Reddit (i.e, article-sharing instead of pictures, videos, or music), AND use Bitcoin, AND be interested in Bitcoin-related news and analysis. That's probably someone who is more of a nerd or brainiac, and not an average- or below-average-minded person. 
I don't think there's some herd mentality here as there is in many of the most subscribed subreddits where posts and commenters get hundreds of points in a couple hours. My point is that highly voted comments usually *are* value-adding, insightful, and thought-provoking. And thus, we need comment scores! :D

I would say that the absolute cutoff point for any claim to Bitcoin-related foresight, as of the year 2015, would be September 30, 2013, when it was at $118.48. The better cutoff date would be January 28, 2013, when it was at $19.87 (1987 being the year of the big stock market crash). And right now it's at $363.08.

I very respectfully disagree. As he says, he supports the whole broadcast by selling things--"We're listener-supported." There are 4 main ways to support a show (or website, for that matter): sell physical products, offer a service, request donations (as Wikipedia is doing yet again right now), or get funding from a backer. He sells products. The ads are almost always at the end of the videos and you can simply just click out of the page. 
It's apple to apples: I'd say that when I watch NBC primetime from 8 - 11 PM five nights a week, THEY are going out of their way to sell me a Subway Tuscan Chicken Melt, a State Farm insurance policy, a Geico insurance policy, a Progressive insurance policy, and a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu. I'd say that having to sit through the same commercial for each of those 4 things literally 60-70 times a week sure looks like THEY are trying really hard to extract money from me, but because they are big companies who've paid millions of dollars for years and years to have their brands imprinted on the public psyche, you see some fundamental difference between them and the clothing, books, and DVDs that Alex Jones is selling. But it's all still advertising of products for the purpose of supporting a broadcast and thereby supporting both businesses (the show and the company that produces the advertised product). But thanks to DVR technology, I can skip those commercials, too, just as I can do with YouTube videos, and you can too.

Where do you get the 2-4M estimate from? Is there a site that quotes that figure? This is of particular interest to me, since I know someone who works for a startup that has about 3M monthly uniques, and he's always ripping on Bitcoin.

You're talking about their intelligence, not wealth, and you're also implying that Bitcoin must be validated by way of transfer to another currency. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 10:45:36


And that's because so many companies are still foolishly refusing to accept Bitcoin.


And so many companies are still foolishly refusing to accept Bitcoin, which they could transfer to local fiat currency once they get paid. 


That's still a very far-progressed view of it, seeing as how minimally it is accepted right now. It would be hard to find an online vendor that *refuses* PayPal or Visa. Maybe you meant "challenger" instead of "competitor." And I don't see it as something to replace the dollar or the euro; it's another currency. And I think one of the main messages on this subreddit is not "Kill the dollar," but "Learn about Bitcoin and try it."

Ok, I agree with you saying that Bitcoin's early adopters have included drug dealers and a few of the more cavalierly investing Wall Street types (financial-industry workers), but...pimps? In what way are actual real-life pimps using Bitcoin for some aspect of their pimping business? I guess that would also perhaps involve prostitutes who use it, yes?

It's a question of reality being defined by...reality, the same way that when 1 billion people use a word in a certain way, that word has that meaning even if no standard published dictionary contains that definition. I guess Goldman Sachs would only recognize Bitcoin as a currency if a sovereign country officially adopted Bitcoin it as a national currency, so that it can then join all the other currencies on the Forex market, and Goldman traders and investors can jump in and start gaming and manipulating it. But then Bitcoin would be something very different than what it is, since it's not issued by some country's central bank.

Well, that's YOUR worry. You're not ready to make the leap, or rather take the step, in the direction of embracing Bitcoin with more confidence, and you said in your previous comment that your participation in this subreddit is more a passive, intellectual/observational one, rather than an active, believing/evangelizing one. 


It's not nobody, but it's extremely few companies and vendors, and is that is the PROBLEM that the article is squarely addressing. 
And the fact that you just implicitly identified PayPal-account money as a crypto-currency, or as something nearly comparable with a crypto-currency in its function and its use, shows a fundamental misunderstanding of much of what digital peer-to-peer crypto-currencies (and certainly the vanguard one, Bitcoin) are, that all I can do is recommend taking the time reading this article from beginning to end:

The really hockey-stick growth of the currency will be whenever 2 or 3 of the the 200 or so current Hollywood celebrities promote it--by which I even include them simply SAYING the word "Bitcoin" on TV or in a video, as long as the statement about it or reference to it is not disparaging or as part of a punchline. I have a theory with quite a bit of empirical support, that such social networks as Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram did not get hugely popular (as in, "everybody" knows them) until the most popular individuals in society--i.e. famous actors, actresses, singers, and rappers--associated themselves with it. Whether the next powerhouse social network will be Snapchat, Vine, Pinterest, or something else, hinges very much on "star power" support, I believe. 
To put it in concrete terms: I'm not joking when I say that a single tweet from Katy Perry saying "Hey everybody! Get yourselves some Bitcoin!   would make the currency skyrocket in value and use. Maybe it's more likely that such a message would be from Twitter manager, lol. Social-media companies now use the term "influencer" to denote people with particluarly huge online fanbases and followings. The obedience of their followers and the attention from media outlets would only multiply the viral effect, and then Bitcoin will be known to AND used by millions more across the country and around the world. Maybe someone from Litecoin or Ripple (the # 2 and 3 most valuable cryptocurrencies out of some 454, as of this comment -  ) is reading this right now and will put the theory to test by paying off whoever they can afford here for some promotion:

In both cases, advertisements for separate products are the way that a broadcast is paid for, but you just have a problem with the show's host being the spokesperson/brand ambassador for the products, and that's your problem. In the 1950s, TV hosts regularly would do spots for the products that sponsored the show (mostly food, drinks, and cleaning products, whether for carpets, counters, or teeth), and amusingly, in the last few years before he switch to satellite radio, Howard Stern was doing those same type of old-fashioned spots every morning for things. You may have this problem with it, but clearly not enough of a problem to have not voluntarily sat through enough of those independent/survivalist/prepper product spots to enthusiastically rattle off that very thorough list of products that he offers. And just as every commercial-jingle writer's dream is to get people the parrot and reference the jingle even in stray conversations, I'd say that this is a case where some level of brand awareness has been achieved, and that's a goal in itself, and an impressive one at that, considering the ocean of American political-commentary channels on YouTube that you and I haven't heard of or watched. I only ended up on this page after I tried submitting the same video, and I'll continue to try sharing more as I deem them relevant to whatever particular subreddit.

Actually her simplistic, fun-loving persona is a carefully crafted act intended to be consistent with the lyrical content and attitude of the songs that she makes millions of dollars from. In the internal record-company meetings and daily correspondences, she is very sharp and we make sure she has a thorough understanding of the terms, conditions, and requirements of the contractual obligations behind every single thing she publicly says, does, wears, and purchases, or even *wants* to do. And that includes all her "love affairs" and "relationships," which are carefully arranged, managed, and have their course scripted by managers, agents, and handlers in conjunction with her fashion stylists and an array of entertainment-media writers, editors, and publishers. The pop-marketing business may not require the same level of brainpower as say, astrophysics, genomics, or quantum computing, but you can't THAT dumb and be a musical performers. In the field of American politics, however, you can. In short, I'll bet she could understand Bitcoin.

I thought that too, and I think that author purposely says "blockchain" in the headline because there are so many kneejerk anti-Bitcoin readers out there who tune out as soon as they see the word. Incidentally, those same people also don't seem to know or understand what the blockchain is; they blur Bitcoin together with all sorts of online scams. I know a guy who's been saying that "Bitcoin is Bitbullshit" for years; in fact, he even wrote that statement in an email on January 28, 2013, when Bitcoin was at $19.87, amusingly (as that was the year of the big stock market crash of the '80s).

Sounds like a very casual HODLer to me... I got both CoinMarketCap.com AND CoinCap.io open continuously on my computer and phone, and switch back to it between every mental breath I take. "Oh, a display in the middle of this news article I'm reading? &lt;clicks tab to check the price on both lists&gt;"... "Oh, this YouTube music video is taking one second to load? &lt;clicks tabs to check the price again&gt;"... "I wonder what time it is &lt;clicks the tabs before checking the time&gt;"

I know, it's so annoying to know the value of a unit of money in my possession. 8000AUD, 15000AUD, whatever. They're just numbers. Money itself is pretty fuckin annoying too.

Thank you bringing me into the majors. Now I just gotta figure out how to create a Bitcoin bank account. Can I do it all on Chase.com? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:53:42
In the past 2 weeks, I had one friend who created an account on Coinbase and another who created one on Gdax, and both had inexplicable delays and problems in the first few days. The Coinbase guy bought .05 of BTC and 1 ETH (respectively $286 and $312) and then his account was suddenly "frozen" (his word) for 4 days but then it was fine. Maybe the sites are just totally overwhelmed by both the volume of activity and these astonishing price fluctuations, and all sorts of crazy things that even a tiny fraction of users are doing.

I've used it many a time to see pictures of girls I've met in real life. Great for finding out someone's real age. Just last month I got to know a girl who voluntarily referred to herself as being 26, but I already knew, from a few different sites via Pipl, that she is in fact 32.

**Agenda-setting theory** is the theory that the mass-news media have a large influence on audiences by their choice of what stories to consider newsworthy and how much prominence and space to give them. Agenda-setting theory’s central axiom is salience transfer, or the ability of the mass media to transfer importance of items on their mass agendas to the public agendas. As political scientist Bernard C. Cohen wrote in 1963: **"The press may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about."**
While most mainstream media outlets ignore Bitcoin unless there's something negative to say (such as the recent frenzies over the following: *Bitcoin darknet marketplace AlphaBay has been shut down! Wall Street Billionaire Jamie Dimon bashes Bitcoin again! China is outlawing Bitcoin! Bitcoin flash-crashes from $4100 to $3300 from Sep. 13-15!*, and so on), CNBC does several positive articles about it every week:

659 is a hell of a lot. There are only 180 circulating physical currencies "recognized as legal tender in United Nations (UN) member states, UN observer states, partially recognized or unrecognized states, and their dependencies." So there are well over more than 3 times more cryptocurrencies. Rearrange the "Currency" column alphabetically by clicking the arrow and you'll see that so many countries use the same currencies. East Timor, Ecuador, and Zimbabwe are said to have "none," but they all most commonly use the Almighty US Dollar, but see the 3 other articles below for more about that!

Hundreds of 60-year-old toupee-wearing politicians who think Bitcoin is some sort of untraceable-money video game will disagree, whenever that vote comes around.

He'll be changing his name to Bitcoin Tony soon enough, mate. Or Ether Tony. Maybe even Lite Tony. Ripple Tony?

What does that mean, and what Latin proverb is it based on? (I tried finding an answer in Google)

whether in Bitcoin or the potentially soon-to-be-created Bitcoin Classic, yes.

I was actually making a point about the subreddit, not against your comment. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:02:50
Exactly. The name is just the name. I mean, what if instead of the name and slogan "Bitcoin - *Vires in Numeris*," the currency were "CyberDollars - *Use 'em instead of your country's currency!*"

Perhaps "Entering or Reentering" would indeed have been more thorough--and serve as a reminder to travelers. Putin's recent meeting with the founder of Ethereum will probably be used as a reason to expedite the passage of this bill. Take a look at the news coverage -

This may be a dumb question but, by "paper wallets," you mean actual slips of paper with QR codes on them? I've seen those on eBay, but never known or even heard of anyone here using those.

Do you really think that that one word-change would have made a difference in terms of this reaction? I mean, consider how the name "bitcoin" contains the word "coin," as in, a physical piece of a money, a medium of exchange or legal tender. Maybe this new currency should have been called something with no relation to money at all, like, I dunno, "ethereum" or "ripple" or something. (I know, those names are completely nonsensical and absurd, I'm just spitballin' here.)
