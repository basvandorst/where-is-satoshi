Well I am no wise dude, but I have lived 50 years and stupidity and/or incompetence explains most things. Of course greed can cause a lot of stupidity.

I think he is just being an elitist jackass, do not waste your time being serious with him.

Hey I learned in the US Navy that a good fuck up explains a hell of a lot.

I believe the maxim of do not come up with complex conspiracies, when greed and incompetence explains it. Occams Razor.

Apparently cryptonewsonline also has a market "program" that will steal Bit, Lite, and Doge wallets. Possibly others but I have not read about them.

I did not say it would, who says the winner has even been created, and once it is we will look at it and say of course it should have those features. Maybe Cryptos do not own the future, they are just a stepping stone on the way there.

Well as I was 11 and 12 respectively it was not so easy, and hindsight is 20/20.

If sued in an American court, he has to testify as Civil proceedings are not covered under the 5th. However, he could demure on anything of a criminal nature.

Old dude here, in 1975 Sony introduced Beta-Max, and one year later JVC introduced VHS. Every-one just knew Beta-Max was going to be THE video tape format as it was backed by Sony. Do not count your chickens before they hatch.

I agree and in fact I am a rarity on Reddit. A Conservative, albeit from California with heavy Libertarian leanings. I do not get it virtual currencies can really help transform things, and help reduce the amount of money the bankers and financial "service" folks reap from raping the rest of us.

CP really? I have seen tons of businesses accepting BTC, LTC, Doge, et al. Was that supposed to be a slam and I am not getting it?

I think it is rubbing their faces in it, I may be alone but I have seen posts on DogeCoin about not doing that as well.

You see I do not know, that is all I was saying. I am 49 and the only thing constant in my life, born in 1964, has been change. I was not trying to insult you, I have no investment in Dogecoin. So blast away as you wish.

Good, I think the infighting is stupid, as someone who turns 50 in a few weeks I like the thought of liberating currency from the assholes who manipulate it and charege us to death for access to our own money. Of course whales have and will maipulate the cryptos in the short term, but my bet is the Genie is out of the bottle.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:59:06
OK then

OK I am going to sound like an old guy here, mainly because I will be 50 this coming April. It is analogous to the cable networks and providers fighting so hard against streaming. Look at HBOs GO and having to have a cable account to get it. When in reality they are only sticking their finger in the dike. Things are changing, and the system that made them a crap load of money and power are going the way of the dinosaur. I have seen this over and over with the old folks fighting the future as they want things to stay the same, the thing is they always lose. This does not mean current crypto currencies will win, after all who ever owned a betamax video recorder? The fought still has to occur as to who will win the future.
