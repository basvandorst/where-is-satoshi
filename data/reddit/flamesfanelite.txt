Yeah but people don't use that. They browse the AppStore and see the top 10 apps and download them. If someone has the choice of choosing an app or a web browser they're gonna choose the app due to simplicity. Majority of the public isn't very tech savvy

Does Gemini have mobile support? I think a big reason coinbase is so huge is because they have an app for smart phones. People want to be able to buy and watch prices closely seamlessly wherever they are. Almost nobody has desktop or laptop access everywhere they go

Sell if you want your money. There's no guarantee you won't lose it in BTC. If you're gonna be upset about losing it all you probably shouldn't be buying BTC

fair point

"No data to support the claim" is where I stopped reading

Unfortunately I can't buy on GDAX since I'm in Canada

Not really his fault that you put your life savings into crypto though

That isn't a wallet

Thats why the alts spiked a couple hours ago too

Nobody knows the future. We could all tell you what you want to hear but in the end, none of it is certain.

Sadly this doesn't work for Canadians as GDAX doesn't allow us to buy or sell anything.

Do it

If you can't afford to lose money, you shouldn't be investing. If you lose sleep over losing money, you shouldn't be investing. If you'd be okay (financially, mentally) losing whatever you put in then go ahead and put some more money into it

Why do you say coinbase isn't recommended?
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:27:13
Price is dropping as people exchange their BTC back into alt coins 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:31:09
yeah, nothing is quite as user-friendly as coinbase though 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:38:39
Never actually thought of doing that (lol). Just kinda assumed it wouldn't be very mobile friendly. Thanks!

There isn't really a right or a wrong time. Wait too long and you might miss your chance. Nobody really knows where its going to go so just pick a good spot and jump on in haha
