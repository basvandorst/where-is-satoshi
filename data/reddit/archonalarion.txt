That's true, but if fractional reserve banking is problematic, it's worth people complaining about it. Even if it isn't *innately* problematic, discussion is good. On the net, it's easy to get circlejerk vibes from people going on about fractional reserve banking and the Fed. Offline, it is rare that anyone brings it up. Sometimes, online circle jerks can bring important issues into focus. I know that you are a frequent skeptical poster, but I hope you realize that what seems like an annoying circlejerk on reddit is often a relatively informed opinion of a minority compared to the offline discussion.

Merchants will discount the price of their goods with deflationary money. Think about it, by giving a merchant deflationary money, you are giving them something which is increasing in value. Therefore, they have more incentive to discount their prices, especially given some market competition.

Selective decreasing. One piece of regulation balances on another piece to counteract yet more regulation. The ultimate argument is that we would be better off with the minimal amount of regulation for all areas of the economy. Regulation in one area will distort another area, creating the need for additional regulation.
It's like making so many house rules to a game, that the original game is no longer visible and only those players who can afford specialist "rules analysts" can play. One rule is removed "deregulation" and suddenly certain players gain an advantage, but the game is still vastly distorted.

I would not be surprised if the GOP takes to Bitcoin more quickly than the Dems. The GOP has a suffocated, but still lingering libertarian/paleocon constituency and they are often fund/ad hungry in local and state regions, excepting the times when the Kochtopus pumps money up their rearends. The Dems have rich city-folk and the media for the nationals and state funds, and unions for localities. Note - Rothbard coined the term "kochtopus", so I don't feel bad using it haha.
In the end, I hope Silicon valley and a "born-again" libertarian-leaning GOP help fight against anti-crypto laws. Eventually, the non-venture capitalist neolibs will come around, but only if some major, and populist, multinationals take to our little trojan horse first.

Ostracism from the network or voluntary submission to arbitration. Occasional armed seizures either covertly or overtly depending on popular approval.
Smart contracts aren't self-enforcing they are self-administering. Reputation systems will play a big part in what course of action is taken for enforcement. I think ostracism will be a popular deterrent. It is one of the oldest forms of deterrence and it remains consistent with liberal property conventions.

If the hard cap on Bitcoins is removed or extended, then, ceteris paribus, the value of each unit of Bitcoin will decrease proportionately. So it would not be in the interest of miners (ceteris paribus) to increase the cap because they will not only devalue the coins they hold, but will also destabilize faith in the currency, further devaluing their coins.

Somewhat related - why deflation is benign:
Merchants will discount their prices relative to their expected time-frame turnover of the money they receive (how long they will hold the money) combined with the expected rate of appreciation (how quickly the money is gaining value).
They are rewarding you for giving them something that will likely increase in value, hence a discount, incentivizing you to spend rather than hold the money.
In this specific case though, I think the discount is more influenced by the reduction in fees, because Newegg isn't holding on to the coins. I hope you can see my point though. The inflationists only look at one side of the coin, they forget the perspective of the merchant.

You are exaggerating, or speaking of big prices jumps that happens to Bitcoin now. I'm talking about a steady and gradual deflation.
It doesn't matter anyway, because the merchant would offer 2 laptops *today*, knowing that the price would increase tomorrow. Given that they also know about the ratio of laptops to BTC today and tomorrow, they would want to give away their laptops, which are decreasing in value relative to BTC.

In a free market context, the rare rise of monopolies post-competition is a good thing. It means that society (in at least one area) has so much certainty, trust, and efficiency that it is able to effectively plan production centrally with little recourse to the price mechanism. Sort of like a bunch of small competing families becoming one big family that is so smart and trustworthy that people are able to organize like a household. The system allocates resources better than a market (in that area).
Firms and other forms of centralization arise for this reason (even perhaps states). At certain points and in certain areas humans are able to come up with planned systems of resource allocation that are even better than the unplanned and roundabout market system.
That almost never happens though and will likely happen less and less as the economy grows increasingly complex, so complex that no person or group or even a super-computer could possibly organize even a substantial percentage of it without recourse to markets and exchange.
So, if the possession of Bitcoin becomes centralized (assuming a free market), that would indicate that in the area of Bitcoin at least, society "knows" that Bitcoins are best kept in the hands of those specific people and institutions. I doubt that will happen though.
One other concept to keep in mind: If bitcoins were cornered they would need to retain their usefulness, otherwise their value will drop. At a certain point, cornering the market might decrease the value of the coins and thus the value of further cornering.

That is why I will soon be withdrawing my (relatively) small amount of BTC from your service.
As much as I trust your company, I really do not think you fully understand what you've stumbled into. Bitcoin is an anarchist/extropian conspiracy 25+ years in the works.

They raid, plunder, and steal, but also trade and enterprise.

How do you know that the consequence of monopoly, resulting from natural economies of scale is not better for society at large? Maybe there is a wisdom that you do not fathom?
Laws and regulations require a state, and the state incurs substantial costs to society, both intentional and unintentional, ostensible and latent. The state, of course, is also a monopoly, but worse, one entrenched by violence and dogma. I do not see any reason to trust such an institution's judgement over the choices of consumers in a free market.

Actually, I would argue that although Bitcoin does derive significant value as a first order good (aesthetic value), it's primary value is derived from its utility as a higher order good (specifically, as an institutional good) because by using it in conjunction with others, one gains greater consumptive potential relative to existing alternatives (western union, visa, paypal, fed, etc.).

Why would anyone be left holding the bag, if there is still a use in using bitcoins to represent money and assets? Anyone who wants to use Bitcoin purely as a way to transfer money, will need to acquire those scarce bitcoins from *somebody*.
Bitcoin is a p2p electronic cash (i.e. asset title, banknote) system. There is a demand for cash to exist as a way of transferring value, and bitcoins happen to be scarce.
At the end of the day, you could use bitcoins (or fractions of bitcoins) to represent titles to a physical asset. If all the bitcoins have been used up as "colored coins", then there will be a demand for pure bitcoins, untied to physical assets.
If the fiat price of Bitcoin drops close to $0, it still has a potential use as a token representing the title to some asset, and if that title system is better than alternatives, that creates a demand for more of these tokens, and thus the price will rise.
Bitcoins do have a use other than money, as tokens representing the title to something else, for instance, a stock, vote, or usage-right.
You're banging your head against the wall, Dave, because you mistake bitcoin as trying to be a commodity money, when it's really way to make scarce, electronic cash/banknotes/asset-titles, and yes, there is a demand for those things.

As shwag has asked, why are such loans necessary with a deflationary economy?
You are saying loans won't work because deflation won't let it work, but are such loans even necessary in a deflationary economy? Maybe such loans are a consequence of the status quo, but actually useless otherwise. Maybe people will go, "Yeah I really wouldn't want to take out a large loan in this deflationary economy, but why would I anyway? I'll just hoard to save."

It's a matter of relativity.

Europeans expect socialist/conservative/fascist/labor politics, we have higher standards. No offense. Not that the USG lives up to those standards, but the cultural component is still important.
NY is the state in which America's banks live. Those banks are the most powerful and wealthy banks in the world. They are the most powerful and wealthy institutions in the world. They collectively own more wealth than that which has ever existed in the entirety of human history. We have reasons to believe their pocket NY regulators are up to no good.

It would only happen if:
1. The decimal place of a Satoshi could not be feasibly extended. If it can be extended indefinitely, then it can be periodically adjusted to provide more granularity as satoshis are permanently lost.
2. It got to the point where Satoshis were too valuable to price low cost goods in because the decimal place could not be extended appropriately.
3. (It would only happen if) The utility of Bitcoin as a currency was threatened by the above to *such an extent* that the devaluation of each Satoshi (due to the increased cap) would be offset by the added utility of increasing the coin cap to provide liquidity/granularity.
A problem that may arise, however, is that human collective-irrationality/path-dependency will *undervalue* the added utility provided by increasing the coin-cap at the crucial point, and thus will allow bitcoin to slowly die and eventually be replaced by substitutes as all units of bitcoins are eventually lost. This will not be an issue for decades, but it could become a topic of debate today, if the relatively small and "path-open" group of devs and minors that currently exist decide it is.

Not that all Bitcoiners are libertarians, but technically speaking American libertarians are liberals. The term liberal is more appropriate, but mainstream discourse has changed the meaning of the word, so that to be an "extreme liberal" means the opposite of being liberal (one who favors a secular, minimalist government with a constitution, market economy, and pluralistic culture). Now "liberal" means a progressive social democrat, someone who has rejected classical liberalism at least partially.

Bitcoin is a system that strengthens as a whole, the more distributed its maintenance is. It is an incredibly intriguing system, but ultimately these sorts of systems (which may arise arise in all stratas of human enterprise), despite solving the issue of trust and cooperation in one area, push the issue of trust and cooperation into another more murky area. The other area is the realm of culture and ideology, which is why the libertarian underpinning of the network is vitally important, but often derided or disregarded.

It is well known that he is extremely conservative about tech, especially information technology. From his perspective, this stuff is too new and too disruptive to be properly assessed for its value to society. So he is very skeptical and cautions people about novel tech investments.
I think his perspective is pragmatic for the risk-averse investor, but sometimes life calls for being risky. In Bitcoin's case, it requires understanding of pretty technical computer science concepts and simultaneously economic concepts and the general trend of political institutions. One wrong move and you've made a great error. Bitcoin investing is an instance of knowing the technical fundamentals, doubling down on your political beliefs (which matter, I assure you), and taking a risk. Risk isn't always the way to go, but neither is conservatism. Best to mix it up and diversify based on your personal interests and idiosyncrasies. Hindsight is 20/20 yadda yadda.

Regulation, in this circumstance, is a case of multiple variables. Essentially, the capital trading populace has a bias against non-regulated exchanges, those exchanges operating in a world that has not yet evolved market solutions to non-state-regulation. Therefore, although it will likely have adverse effects (outwards), exchanges that are regulated by the state will give confidence  to those religiously attached to statism and therefore may likely reduce volatility as a side-effect of their participation. It's a complex subject, but yes, you are correct that a centralized and severely over-extended land territory owning institution does not in and of itself reduce volatility by regulation of its internal subject institutions. At least, it is quite unlikely that it could given its over extension and lack of informed incentives.

Fair enough, and thank you. I only mentioned my thoughts because the artistry of the music video provoked the ideas within me. Sometimes music videos are relics of contemporary cultural status symbols or else propaganda for the state complex. Sometimes they reach deeper and provoke ideas of a more philosophical basis.
The geometry and linguistic meaning of this video was worthy enough (imo) for me to comment about how god will be re-imagined in the 21st century, due to the specific aesthetic and poetic choices of the artists.

Yes, it is. I may be disappointed by the price changes, but I am not upset or angry, nor am I blaming the market for my decisions.
As you said, we do not have a free market. The FBI seized bitcoins from the Silkroad due to the (quite anti-free market) war on drugs. They still have coins to sell off (more supply, same demand = lower price). further, potential Money Service Businesses have to wait for the Bitlicense (not free market) to complete before they initiate. These factors are likely contributing to the decline in price. Even further, the strengthening of the dollar due to the Fed's QE regime.
Bitcoin is a tiny free market inside a not-so-free market world. Libertarians complain about intervention partially because it means that we (as observers) cannot really tell if markets are operating organically or if they are skewed due to the manifold distortions. It means that we as individuals have less of an understanding of why things are happening. It obscures economic calculation.

Only until the vast majority of the world is Darwinian and atheist will humanity find god. This is a pseudo-contradiction which has been awaiting exposition since the 16th century. This dynamic is not specific to Bitcoin, but is a factor in its development, as in all developments which universalize, rather than divide human action.. 
God is and has always been the unknown... the darkened part of our knowledge which we anthropomorphize into a projection of our selves. In this century, if things go well, the majority of humanity will realize the vastness of our anti-knowledge and thus the luminous magnitude of "god", that part of ourselves which we relegate to the blackness of infinity, infinity being a projection of our infinite self object (as self-perceived by the self; a unique development of selfness).

It also ignores the concept, that if Bitcoin pushes other institutions into non-existence (Western Union, credit card companies, banks, wall street, etc.) then that's quite a lot of energy "saved". I am not saying this will happen, but if Bitcoin electricity use was to become so high that it was actually significant, then it would already be at the point where it would have made obsolete a number of industries that has used electricity even less efficiently.

The Gist:
The U.S. government and financial industry have been shitting their pants for 2 decades about the possibility of a financial war with China and Russia involving computer hacking of wallstreet.
The *real* reason why Wallstreet is getting in on Bitcoin is because it offers the possibility of a system less vulnerable to Russian and Chinese hackers.
Further, the U.S. economy is going to implode in a matter of years and many strategists in the gov and fintech have concluded that the cyber-attacks will come when the U.S. economy is most vulnerable (kick 'em while they're down).
So, if you were ever wondering why the U.S. is surprisingly bullish on Bitcoin, it's because they are hoping it can reduce certain vulnerabilities in the financial sector (which it can, possibly).

I think it could mean two things (or both)
1. He is sort of worried about the price, but expects or hopes that there will be big buy-ins at the bottom.
2. He is excited about the price and he himself will be buying in at the bottom (and maybe he has been helping to drive the price down all along in anticipation of this sell-off).
I don't think he is sadistic, he's either anxious/hopeful or gleeful that his plan is coming to fruition (to buy a large chunk of btc at a bargain price).

It's a complex problem. We could develop third-party oversight services and maintain the libertarian ethos, but there will be many fuck-ups along the way, and so much money chasing the central bank's credit bubble right now, that decentralization, holding, or regulation are the only timely solutions. Like most things in history, the result will be a mixed bag of good and bad, forward and backward, but hopefully a bit more good and a bit more forward.

Interesting use-case on page 14:
**Use case 3: Power bartering**
Physical assets are often unused a majority of the time. These underused
resources cannot often be effectively utilized due to challenges around
discoverability, trust, security and an effective payment mechanism. ADEPT proposes to
address this in a big way. A small instance of this concept is
captured in the power bartering use case.
The washer, in this use case,
• Is in a contractual agreement with other medium-to high-power consumers in the house.
• It subscribes to analytics from a feeder that indicates an upcoming spike in
power price. Accordingly it determines that a power negotiation is required
with its peers to ensure that the owner is not hit with punitive charges
The washer, which is currently operational, detects
that the TV is currently
It requests a power down from the TV.
However, the TV’s analytics indicate that it cannot power down, as this is
peak TV viewing time
The TV
declines and in turn compensates the washer with owner
approved tokens as per the contract conditions.
The washer accepts the payment and delays its cycle by a couple of hours.
The TV in
the viewers that an impending power price hike has been
offset by the washer delaying its cycle.
A second part of the use case has the washer negotiating directly with a
community owned micro-grid. In exchange for specific KWH of power for
one week, the washer offers a specific number of free wash cycles to
community members at a later date, as per the contract set up by the
owner with the community.

In an asset based economy, personal saving can be accomplished simply by "holding" money until something of worth finally comes along that you want to spend the money on.
It creates a natural savings mechanism.
The only "problem" that I can see with a deflationary, asset-based economy is that people will have to get used to prices AND wages falling. People will need to think of their labor more like a good they are haggling rather than "plugging-in" and deserving an ever increasing rate. On the flip-side, prices are always getting cheaper.

The concepts that are relevant here are praxeology, history, and ideal types.
*Praxeology* is purely how self-aware, acting beings coordinate means and ends in a context of limited resources. It is a very abstract sort of logic, basically the logic of "freewill" in relation to scarce means.
*History* is about what has actually happened filtered through a theory of relevance and meaning. History is data combined with analysis.
*Ideal Types* are explanatory analytical devices. For instance, an entreprenuer or "promoter" or firm or state is an ideal type.
So, Menger and Mises were speaking of the evolution of money *praxeologically*, how it is logically possible, given the axioms of human action, how money can evolve out of barter endogenously.
Graeber is talking about money in the historical sense, but as we should always keep in mind, filtered through his own selection of relevant vs irrelevant records.
Money itself is an ideal type, a combination of praxeological possibility and historical actuality.
My own opinion is that (perhaps being quite ignorant of Graeber's gist) is that Graeber misunderestimates the full spectrum of barter more abstractly defined.

Democracy does not necessarily "decentralize power".

Bitcoin has utility (intrinsic value, use value, as oppoosed to "exchange value") in 2 ways:
1. Appeal to cypherpunks and libertarians (as sexy as a gold necklace, "baby do you want to see my Bitcoins?").
2. Improved system of money that can potentially lower various costs, risks, instability associated with existing sorts of money systems (gold's poor liquidity, fiat's instability and unfairness).
The argument that Bitcoin does not have use value is absurd. That argument is based on the false assumption that the use value of a money is always unrelated to its value as money. In fact, money itself has use value because through reducing the costs of exchange, it facilitates consumption (use). Even beyond that is the initial hobbyist appeal that Bitcoin had and still has, which is why it people began to exchange it for established currencies and commodities, thus connecting it regressively to fiat and metals (satisfying Mises regression Theorem).

For example, how does one go about making a government? If you consider that in depth, you may realize that although your criteria for the  justification of a theoretical government may rest on doing x,y,z, all past governments have been predicated on religion and military might.

Yes, this is known as a "Goldfinger Attack", named after the infamous James Bond Villain. Essentially, the attacker's motivation is to destroy Bitcoin to gain something external to the Bitcoin market. For instance, some agent of a government that greatly benefits from Bitcoin's demise even if it costs them a lot of money to perform.
There is no systemic defense against this sort of attack, one (considering adopting Bitcoin) just has to factor in the probability of this happening, including all the relevant assumptions about the long-term self-interest, motivations, rationality, and resources of would be attackers.

Yeah, but the only reason why people convert immediately back to fiat is the volatility. The volatility is a product of speculative hype outgrowing adoption. If adoption catches up or speculation stabilizes, then merchants might choose to hold the bitcoins more often. With enough adoption and stability, people could forget about the fiat. Not saying that will happen, but it is a possibiliity. Until then, Bitcoin is just a nifty payment mechanism, mostly of use to libertarians and crypto-nerds.

Here's the thing,
As an anarcho-capitalist, I have no problem with sharing and community. The problem is that social anarchists have not found functional ways to produce the sorts of institutions they desire. Not on any significant scale. Bitcoin could lead to those institutions, but it was the right-libertarians and ancaps that latched onto it first, whilst many social anarchists remain skeptical or antagonistic because they hate money and commerce to begin with.
An advanced division of labor society, where most everyone is reliant on an interdependent network of trade, is not isolationist. It is far more "social" than the yeoman-artisan depiction of individuals in a mutualist society. If profit from trade is hampered by possession-based property regime, then trade will be less valuable, the division of labor less valuable, and interdependence less valuable.

I'm not sure, I wanted to hear people's suggestions about adjusting interest based on the risk of inflationary or deflationary fluctuations. It seems pretty intuitive that rapid inflation and deflation would disrupt the economy for some people.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:56:22
Yeah me too. I think they are screwing us due to the crash. They specifically said it was possible to cancel on the buy page.

That misses the other side of the equation: Those who receive the currencies (like merchants). Merchants would prefer getting the deflationary currency, so they will discount prices there, and bump prices for the inflationary currency. Why would they not factor inflation/deflation into the price? I mean a price adjustment with "real" not simply statistical reasons. By giving a merchant a deflato-coin, you are essentially give them a little nest-egg, so they would give you a lower price, because the value you give them will increase.

I'm emailing them again... ugh. I would never have ordered in the first place if I knew I couldn't cancel. They fricking said you could cancel, what is this crap?

My comment on her blogpage:
"As a merchant, why would I accept an inflationary currency over a deflationary one? I would price the inflato-coin higher to break even.
If I am a merchant accepting either currency, and I know I am going to spend the currency I get today on goods tomorrow, then the price of the inflato-coins will be equivalent to the value that the deflato-coins will be tomorrow.
1. Deflato-coin will double in value tomorrow
2. Inflato-coin will half in value tomorrow.
3. Today, 1 defcoin = 1 infcoin in exchange rate
4. Good X costs 1 defcoin today (equaling 2 tomorrow) or 4 infcoins today (equaling 2 tomorrow)
In other words, the merchant will offer a lower price for defcoins, knowing they will be more valuable tomorrow, and a higher price for infcoins, knowing they will be less valuable.
Everyone ends up hot potatoing the infcoins trying to get rid of them as quickly as possible, so who the heck is actually buying them in exchange for defcoins? Nobody wants the coins that are losing value, even stable-coin will lose value RELATIVE to deflato-coin.
So basically, the argument (in this case) against deflation is only looking at half of the picture, they are missing the merchant side of the equation. The merchant WANTS deflato-coin, so they will make sure that you the customer pay through your nose for giving them depreciating currency.
Answer: The merchant takes into account the rate of appreciation and depreciation of the coins relative to the merchants expected timeframe for spending either coin. So, the customer will not gain by choosing to spend the depreciating currency because the price of the good will have the expected depreciation factored in, and the same is true for appreciation, except in the reverse, the customer gains a discount rather than penalty, which will be greater or lesser depending on the merchant’s prospective turnover of the coin."

I'm in the same boat. They explicitly said canceling was an option, and I only agreed to the terms BECAUSE I COULD CANCEL. They are screwing us. I'm going to call my bank.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:18:21
Mmm, okay.
So, what might be a plan B in that sort of situation where the attackers want to destroy Bitcoin? Maybe alternative crypto-currencies?

Governments are accountable to corporations. Don't fool yourself. They are the ones with the means to consistently and frequently lobby for privileges. Corporations have only been able to grow unaccountable through these privileges that the government has sold them.

Wouldn't the risk of either inflation or deflation be calculated (to some extent) *prior* to the loan and the rate of interest adjusted accordingly?

If you are of the belief that Bitcoin will get bigger in the long-term, then don't panic sell. If you are buying a small amount of Bitcoins for investment reasons that is.

If getting people to pay their taxes was a matter of persuasion, they wouldn't be called taxes. You are essentially threatening ancaps that if they do not pay taxes, they will be violently subdued. Taxes are not charity, the social contract is mythical, yada yada, etc.

How do I cancel my order just in case? I've gone to the transaction page like the directions said and a cancel option is not appearing...
@_date: 2013-09-24 04:26:53
The "Tangible" category is an invention. There is no reason why a currency *has* to be "tangible", it's just that *in the past* intangibility has implied that the *finite* nature of the currency can be tampered with.
So, tangibility is only valuable to the extent that it insures that the supply of the currency remains definite.
The nature of the Bitcoin network makes tangibility a negligible and even costly alternative.

It was not a bad clip. I think they were reasonably skeptical, whilst still being interested and giving bitcoin some credit as a payment mechanism.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:30:57
I think it's a scam or you have to actually request a cancel from them personally.

Also, those who are receiving the deflationary currency will discount their prices because you are giving them something that will rise in value.
The discount will be based on the expected rate of deflation and the time frame the merchant expects to hold the currency. Deflation means both lower nominal prices and real prices.

Consider this: What if the adjustment government needs is removal? 
I am being intentionally confusing here to highlight the two meanings of "government". Government can mean "that which makes society safe and orderly" and it can mean "the state; a large land-renting cartel."
Libertarians are suggesting an adjustment to government (in the first sense) by removing government (in the second sense). We believe that  order is the daughter and not the mother of liberty. That a decentralized, open-minded, laissez-faire society will be more orderly than one under the yoke of giant land-renting cartels that sell privileges to private corporations.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:37:37
I got credited back, so I'm happy. I think the price will keep dropping, but if I sold today, I'd actually make a few bucks, so Coinbase may keep my business. Good luck!

That's what scarce money does (assuming you are still holding unrealized gains). It makes you more frugal in habit, and also begins to affect how you think about life in a wider sense.
Imagine an entire society that only spends money on things they cannot live without, readjusting investment towards more ambitious projects with bigger future payoff, pushing the human lifespan in an effort to realize their investments... Forget that Katy Perry,  spend spend spend crap. We'd become like... elves who live in space. Fedoric, I know, but one can dream.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:47:36
True. I wasn't advocating the implementation of the scheme, but I figured it might be part of a grander re-adjustment of government funding in a post-bitcoin world. So they might try that, combined with other measures to tax the wealthy. As Friedman mentioned, land and traditional assets could be taxed normally.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:16:04
I emailed them a couple hours ago. How else do we contact them?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:21:07
I can't find the cancel option on the transfer page and I sent an email.
So, I paid ~$100 yesterday and will receive my BTC on the 15th. Will I get $100 worth of BTC for yesterday's market price or the 15th? Obviously, that would determine whether I cancel or not.

Republicans and democrats though, champions of intellectual consistency! Oh, how I moan with gleeful delight whenever one of the enlightened adherents to a mainstream political ideology bestows upon me a tirade of well-worn and easy-peasy arguments they heard from their father, or perhaps their favorite television pundit.
Those libertarians though, they really should just move ter somalier already cuz if they don' like it THEY CAN JUST GET OUT.
