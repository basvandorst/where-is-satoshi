To be honest, I think posting this is entirely unhelpful. 
They f’d up the upgrade roll out, yes, but now that the exchange is back up and running it is working perfectly.  Not a single error for me in over a dozen trades and all of them were instant.  I’ve also been able to process crypto withdrawals (haven’t tried Fiat) to wallets that were processed quickly and without error. I have also successfully deposited fiat since the relaunch.
The comments you pasted were people rightly venting their frustrations, often in the usual overhyped manner regularly seen on reddit. But they’re now out of date, the crypto world moves fast.

I was wondering why the exchange I use was always lower than the global average, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:11:58
Amen to that!  It's like a completely different sub.

Bot now back on and selling in 0.3 chunks?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:26:43
Back to 0.2 again...
Does anybody know much about how these bots work? Will the sell amounts be automated also, or is someone making a decision on the spot to increase/decrease pressure?
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:09:56
Yeah, that's my point - 25/4 was two weeks ago...

Yeah, except that instead of letting 20 people on the boat each trip there’s nothing stopping 2 people with all their belongings (data) from getting on Johnny’s boat and using it to move house. He has no way of stopping them doing that, because all he cared about was having a bigger boat and didn’t invest in any kind of ticketing system.

What are you even talking about?  The median transaction fee is currently about $0.31 and the average is $1.32 - still lots of people getting super cheap fees, not our fault some people are pushing through unnecessarily high transaction fees.
There was a four day spike about two weeks ago, but that resolved quickly...

No, I would presume they're going to create derivatives based on the price of BTC that have nothing to do with the underlying coins.  Nobody will own any BTC, or even need to purchase any, they're literally just betting on the price going up/down and exchanging fiat.  Hence why people saying this is institutional money flooding in are all kinds of wrong (at this stage), but it does indicate a certain degree of legitimacy (if you call investment banking parasites legitimate...).

Watching someone buy 1 BTC every four seconds on GDAX... XD

Alright, so I'm finally taking this more seriously and going to set up a node - is RaspiBlitz still one of the best ways forward?
I want it to be an educational process and involve a bit of tinkering, but equally want a straight forward tutorial approach to getting everything set up and working (including Lightning).
Can I go with a Raspberry Pi 4 and still follow the GitHub tutorial that builds from a 3?

It's a good idea to buy now.  Even if it corrects by 20-30% just hold for the long term and you will be fine, halving taking place next year.  Nobody can predict the price from day to day - and you will run yourself ragged trying to do so - so just buy in and check price once a week.

This is way too conservative approach considering it rules out 99% of the population (6 months cash savings? $10k non-pension/non-property investments?).  Fine for those in the top earning brackets, but wealth transfer opportunities like this don’t come around very often for everyone else.
Look at it differently - most people go out three or four nights a month and will spend around $100 doing so each time.  Take one of those nights and put it into BTC.  Then convert one of your at home take away nights and add that each month as more BTC or perhaps ETH/altcoin of choice.
Take some of the money you would normally spend on recreational activities and use that - expendable cash, money you can afford to lose.

His sales? This is a major chain store in the heart of one of the world’s biggest cities - they’ll be fine.

I hadn’t heard this particular argument in detail before and it’s a really compelling one - thanks for sharing!

You forgot to mention their first argument, which was widely spoken just a few months ago, that LN was vaporware and would never be released at all.
Yeah, that one was dropped pretty quickly and quietly...

All of these 2 - 25 BTC buys are a beautiful thing to see on this Spring day!
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:57:09
That buying pressure is a beautiful thing to see :)
edit: trying to resist against 20 BTC + 30 BTC sell orders on GDAX...
