No, I press send before I finish my message. Sorry.
I am a bitcoin believer myself, but still we cannot underestimate its volatility.
Just hodl and we shall see the day dollar vanished. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:29:51
I am guessing it's gonna be similar to drug enforcement, on top of that they have their whole Chinese internet monitored, every message you send are being watch.
Meh, commis. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:49:43
That host is basically how 99% of the people here on earth are like.
The 1% are buying more bitcoin by days protecting their wealth while the poor stays ignorant because the 1% telling them it is a scam, ponzi, tulip, it's illegal government going ban it omg don't touch it.
And they fucking believe them, believing those bankers and 1% who have been robbing them a lifetime.
Fuck this world I am living in such bullshit.

They are shutting all of them down before 30th. I think it's official. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:14:45
I have a strong belief the Chinese government plans on shutting down mining as its next target. First ICO, then bitcoin ban, now what's the point of having mining operations when bitcoin already banned. It's only logical.

Shit post continue,
I've been having the same thought that Satoshi Nakamoto is an Alien who came to earth to introduce us Blockchain and Bitcoin.
That is why he never show his face cause he ain't earthling.
That is why he hasn't move a bit of his premined Bitcoin because he has no use.
That is why he disappeared when the community matured for he has to go back to his home planet.
What have we discovered? omg.

I AM HODLING
I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.
so i've had some whiskey
actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

However when major online businesses(Amazon, eBay, Priceline Group, etc) start accepting bitcoin as a payment method, to da moon we go.

I don't know dude but she hot to me
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:23:52
I was about 16 when I first introduced bitcoin's existence.
Very young and I was not the brightest student, still went ahead to try to understand just what the heck is it.
Unfortunately I was too naive and uneducated to even understand the basic and gave up the idea of buying/mining.
Now that I look back, It was 2011 and the price then was around few bucks a coin.
Did not invest until this year, when I finally have a stable income.
Biggest regret of my life to be that stupid.

Mass adoption is the stopping force, not more than 1% of people even adopted Bitcoin yet?
That is the problem we are facing now, and imagine the price for 1 mBTC could be when there are over 10%, 20% or even 50%?
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:00:13
But find your silver lining you are within the group of &gt;1% group who adopted bitcoin, buy more while you still can.
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:00:38
I KNEW BITCOIN BACK IN 2010 WHEN IT WAS 6 CENT BUT HAD NO MONEY AS A GRADE 10 STUDENT PLUS MINING IS TOO HARD TO BE UNDERSTOOD(at least for me as 16 years old back then).
