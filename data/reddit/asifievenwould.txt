Again, this isn't 2009. In world where bitcoin is illegal, so are other digital currencies like Linden Dollar. If crypto/digital currencies actually threaten fiat/Central/World banks, then it will be squashed. They have more money and influence than you can possibly imagine, and hold more power than all governments combined. They literally run the world. Sad but true. If they want it gone, it's gone.

You're dumb
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:18:30
This is actually incorrect, but I understand your sentiment, anyway. Regardless of the intent, though, it could absolutely happen. We are no longer in 2009, BTC is not anonymous, it requires a LOT of electricity to mine, exchanging, etc. All easily traceable. As it exists today, right now, Bitcoin is very vulnerable to legislation.  
I am in no way saying or predicting that any legislation will actually happen, just stating the possibility. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:28:25
It's easy. You just add dollars to your account that can be paid for with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:25:08
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:37:19
Technically true, but they could be legislated into obscurity it becomes too much of a threat. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:59:55
lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:23:33
What a crying ass lil bitch. Lololol. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:32:25
Dude this place already TD. Everybody else knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:40:21
Bitcoin isn't necessary in any of your scenarios, and saying that BTC is more expensive to use because of its security is laughably stupid. lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:59:35
lol. $10.00 is cool and 3 days is acceptable? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:53:09
This is incorrect...
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:07:19
People aren't happy, lol, they just don't wanna pay the fees to xfer all their coin to a new wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:51:19
No. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:49:59
If it's on Gdax, it's on Coinbase and vice versa.

The coins in escrow have no value until released into circulation, all will be released into circulation over the next 5-6 years. 


Yep, and that's how it should be. The minute Ripple itself starts using their coin to manipulate the price, it's game over, any way. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:08:40
If you're on an exchange with a ETH to USD pair, yes. Be careful... Most lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:27:39
lol. Hope the cash out is coordinated... 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:03:12
You're so dumb. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:32:50
There is zero need for bitcoin related to any of those coins.  
Savings account? lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:20:40
No.. He spent $3500 for $2500 worth of coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:26:16
Literally everybody involved in trading cryptos is saying the exact same thing, so, no, he didn't come up with it himself.  
Why you mad? Cuz it's true? 


Yeeeaaaahhhh. Whatever you gotta tell yourself, lol. Denial is a river in Egypt. A dozen shitcoins outperformed BTC this year. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:16:33
And wait 6 days. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:35:44
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:45:43
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:33:26
Still not cheap or fast, lol.  
I hope BTC turns it around. Lightning is coming, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:34:39
They can't be true if they're negative, yeah? lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:21:20
Volatility wouldn't be a concern if the fees weren't so high and it could be converted into fiat quickly and cheaply. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:12:59
lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:14:11
Any exchange. Be careful. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:53:49
Fair enough
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:47:37
You're so dumb. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:31:57
Edit: Thanks for the link, though.

Obvious answer would be *"obviously not"*.
I have hope for BTC, and it's good for what it's being used for right now, but technically proficient aren't saying good things. Just letting you know since you care about what they say. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:37:14
lol
