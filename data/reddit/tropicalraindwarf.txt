Does 'angst' mean 'fear'?
I'm Dutch and I didn't know this was also a word in English.

Thank you, I agree completely.
@_date: 2014-06-08 10:24:36
Mine too! :)

I do affiliate marketing / CPA and I get paid in Payoneer. I use a debit card to spend the money here in The Netherlands. Highly recommend it.
