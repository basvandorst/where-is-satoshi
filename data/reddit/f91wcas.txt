Back in the glory days on digg.com I heard about it twice. Once when it was introduced, and again when it hit $30. I was a teenager back then, and the next time I heard about it again was either reddit or the news. I can't recall exactly.

Do you mean 4 cents? Or do you mean 4% of one cent?

Never buy or sell bit coins with reversible means. Cash is the best option.

Anybody have a transcript of the whole article? This is just a preview.

What you're asking is if it is possible to "time" the market. That is, buy low, sell high. This is very difficult to do on short time frames. 
This analogy is sort of loosely related, but may help you understand. Say you're at a football game, and you plan on leaving it at such a time so as to avoid heavy traffic. You might want to leave thirty minutes before the end of the game to accomplish this. BUT, if everyone had the same idea, and tried to leave 30 minutes early, they would all be stuck in traffic!
So with the market, everyone wants to buy low sell high, but the act of trying to do so by everyone, makes it much more difficult.

I had that attitude at $80 once, now I just buy here and there when I can afford to.

You just play a YouTube video, don't even need to watch it, fill in the captcha, and get 5 ubtc. It's very little bit coin, but it's also very passive. 
The site also has some amazon mechanical Turk type tasks too.

In the US the federal reserve banks do. They are also private banks. That is, not owned by the federal government.

I'm not an expert in what is and isn't reversible. I just only do cash, and I've used coinbase to buy some. Just a heads up for future transactions. Good luck.

Is this the "difficulty level" of mining but coins?
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:01:01
I'm not totally sure. But it hunk it's just a think through amazon to get money, where you do online tasks like look up websites with google. I've heard about it in r/beermoney before.
