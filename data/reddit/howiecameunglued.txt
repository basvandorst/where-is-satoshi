I'm not really for or against Uber; I'm just happy they accept bitcoin.


How exactly? It costs double the price of a cab, and at least for me, it takes longer for an Uber car to arrive than to hail a cab. It might make more sense for people that live in suburban areas, though.

Someone can break into my apartment and steal it much more easily than they can break into an online service. More importantly, I'm afraid I'll screw something up when saving it, and typing a long key in every time I want to spend it ain't cool.
I can sort of see saving it digitally like in an encrypted KeePass file stored on OneDrive. That might be a good compromise since even if Microsoft servers are hacked, the file is still secure.

I get it; I was just pointing out how poorly the logo was designed. Their font choices and web design don't do much to change that opinion.
Not that that says anything about their coffee, and it's awesome they accept bitcoin :-)

What's this about bitcoin adoption in Ukraine? I thought Argentina was the cpinty where bitcoin was seeing the most adoption amongst the lay community.

The thing about GPG not being user friendly is big, IMO. GPG4Win is one of the worst applications I've used; it crashed several times, there are multiple parts to it, and the interface is not at all intuitive.

He said "for a month". So he's willing to give up $3000 to not have to send his ID. Sounds like a genius move right there.

Honestly, I feel safer having Coinbase take care of my money than trying to secure the private keys myself. The chances of Coinbase being hacked seem much less than the chances of my losing access to the private keys or screwing something up irreversibly in the storage process.

Honestly, the fact that big banks are taking an interest in cryptocurrency is probably a good thing in the long run for its adoption (ie being aple to pay with bitcoin in every store) and certainly for its price. The nature of the protocol is such that we're not going to be giving up control to these financial institutions, so why exactly does everyone have a problem with JP Morgan being interested in cryptocurrency?
They're obviously going about it in the wrong way, but once they realize the traction bitcoin has rather than trying to market their own crap, I can only see good things coming from the marriage of existing financial institutions and bitcoin.

Mining is incredibly inefficient. Mining hardware is very expensive and will take a long time to see a return on investment, not counting energy costs. You can turn your GPU on overnight to do some mining pretty easily; but you'll pay a lot more in electricity costs than you'll ever get back (and it's a VERY slow process). Best way is to buy it.

Everything in America can be paid for with a credit card. Even taco trucks on the side of the road often accept credit cards. The idea of paying for things when you buy them is completely lost, it's all about building up debt.
I'm always amazed that I'm considered such a credit risk. Apparently paying for everything yourself, and managing to not borrow any money for 26 years means that I'm a bigger risk than someone who builds up huge amounts of debt and only pays the minimum every month.
Obama has the biggest credit card, of course. If the government can't be responsible with their money, I don't see how the citizens can be trusted to either. So I appreciate in European and Asian countries cash is still a thing people carry with them.

Most bitcoin ATMs have 💩ty rates right now since there's not much competition. As they become more common, we'll see the spread go down. There's also the fact that few people will want to turn cash directly into BTC; most deposit it at a bank then buy via Coinbase or something similar. Those who do want to turn cash directly into BTC are usually willing to accept the price.

The best privacy would be to use a real mixing service like Bitcoin Fog where the inputs and outputs aren't linked (note there's a fee for doing this though). Basically, the idea is that you put money in, and some unrelated coins from other people trickle out over the next few hours. The inputs and outputs are completely unrelated in the transaction log.
Joining multiple transactions, ie using DarkWallet is less anonymous since there is still a direct link in the transaction log from the inputs to the outputs, but it's much quicker to do and doesn't come with a fee.

How exactly did ProtonMail violate PayPal's TOS? I don't see any evidence that's what happened. Is there a clause in PayPal's TOS that a company cant receive a large influx of donations in a short period of time?

This has happened many times before, and will happen many times again. This is what doing business with PayPal is about.

I'm not sure about the "layman" but a lot of hate in seems to come because a small minority of bitcoin proponents are conspiracy theorists/extreme anarchists/paranoid douchebags. If you go around calling people "statists," of course people are going to react negatively.

The "Financial Establishment" by and large doesn't want bitcoin regulated any more than we do. There are certain parts of the banking industry that stand to lose from bitcoin getting bigger (ie western union), however over-regulation of investments is bad for firms which make their money that way. "Big banking" is not overly threatened by bitcoin.
The impetus behind the law is to (attempt to) curtail money laundering and illicit transactions. For that, I see the bill as a complete misunderstanding of the nature of bitcoin, and I doubt it will have any positive effect for law enforcement, but hey that's what you get when the people drafting it have no idea what they're talking about.
EDIT: That's not to say there's some money being thrown around. Seizing drug money and running prisons are pretty lucrative businesses in their own right. But I doubt Citigroup, for example, supports this bill. And any support it has from law enforcement won't see much of a return; they'll just waste their time harassing people who are using bitcoin for legal purposes while people who are laundering money will continue to do so without reporting to the state of New York.

If you're that paranoid, wouldn't you want to generate a new wallet address for each transaction anyway?

So you're saying you're willing to give up 6 BTC (about $3000) because you don't want to send a photo ID? It sounds like you're either doing something illegal, or you're a paranoid tool with so much money you're willing to drop 6 BTC to prove a point.

Hey, you're the CEO of Bitcoin. You're probably the guy they interviewed.

Why? He's acknowledging a stigma about Bitcoin that's a legitimate concern for a lot of people. Bitcoin *is* used for money laundering purposes. It has many other uses, buy I'd say it's pretty ignorant to stick your head in the sand and pretend every transaction is legit.

Checking your balance is definitely a special usage.
