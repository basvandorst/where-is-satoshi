You mean the site that covers Preorders thru Ebay ?


If you are selling goods or services in an online store (not eBay), you may be allowed to presell items but we may hold your money in a reserve account or limit what you can do with your account to reduce the higher risks associated with presale items.
We recommend that you delay authorizing and capturing the money until you have the product available or until you plan on delivering the product or service. Once you have the ability to deliver the product or service:
Authorize the transaction.
Once the authorization is approved, capture the money.
Ship the product within one business day of capturing the money.
On eBay
If you are selling items on eBay that can’t be delivered within 30 days, you must obtain eBay’s approval before you can list the presale item. Learn more about eBay’s presale policy.
Magazine subscriptions (which are considered presale items) aren't allowed to be sold on eBay because the first issue generally can't be delivered within 30 days of the purchase date due to the publisher's processing time.
Promotional items and events
You may be able to presale manufacturer supplied items but your listings must be approved by eBay before the item can be listed.

I proved you wrong and you still won't admit it the fringe policy is a program you have to op in for.

And money laundering never has it been easier to launder money across  international boundries

Nvm there is no 30 day policy considering they would fuck over digital purchases and crowd sourcing

OK So 
Bitcoins are essentially a piece of software in there legal eyes and yes there are different rules for goods available for digital distribution


Claims or Chargebacks for Significantly Not as Described.
Items that you deliver in person, including in connection with In-Store Checkout.
**Intangible items, including Digital Goods, and services.**
PayPal Direct Payments.
Virtual Terminal Payments.
PayPal Business Payments.
Items that are not shipped to the recipient's shipping address on the Transaction Details Page. If you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the Transaction Details Page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller protection. We therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.
I read a lot of the t&amp;c just posted a link to the one i was currently and well pay-pals policy densest change a whole lot from america to AU and Australia has a more stricter buyer protection laws 
So therefore you are full of shit until proven otherwise

Isn't software different for some reason ?
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:30:42
So you where full of shit with the 30 day policy for the Coin farmer things 
The 20 day one is optional 
and only really covers if you trust paypal to hold the money in escrow
you can just bypass and not use the paypal preorder shit

The first  comments try to call the owner a hero 
Second comment points out the whole hiring a hitman part
third comment says it wouldn't happen if it was a legal website
Or did i misunderstand it ?
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:38:23
they answered a question with a question pretty much anything after that turns into shit as we all know
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:48:42
Pretty sure paying one person to kill another person is pretty clear in its moral standpoint we don't really have to use the word murder if you don't like it
But hey as long as we got cheap opium 
@_date: 2013-10-04 02:47:37

That sounds like an assumption you don't know how the DPR guy works and he seemed fairly keen to go for the kill the blackmailer route
