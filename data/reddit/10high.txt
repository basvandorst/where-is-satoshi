It's only lacking, "It was a dark and stormy night..."

Absolutely agree. Once you've been in a while, it becomes normal to deal in decimal amounts, but looking from the outside in, it's alien because it holds little resemblance to what you're used to. Having said that, markets aren't usually for consumers. The average person doesn't buy dollars or whatever from a trading platform, but something like Local Bitcoins could benefit from switching to mBTC IMHO.

Well then, let's hope you never rise to a position of power. Or is it a deep sense of powerlessness within you that makes you so angry?

That's the funniest thing I've read in ages. Thank you!

Agree, whiffs of IT geekdom.

Since the German pope, it's become a kind of joke to phrase everything as if you are the thing itself, like "Wir sind Papst!". Accordingly, I think "Wir sind Bitcoin" works quite well ;) - but what's the reason behind the pic?

Some solid reporting there! ;)

"End up" or "end"? If you want people listen to what you say (which you clearly do), it can only aid your cause if express yourself clearly. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:41:42
Ah I get it. Thanks for taking the time to reply.

It's not too often, but I'm occasionally paid from the US to here in the EU and I hate losing the money on bank fees and conversion rates. I'm basically going to start offering a discount on payments made in BTC. They they can then decide for themselves if it's worth the effort. And I figure that even if they don't go for it, at least it helps publicise BTC as an option and hopefully contribute to popularising it. Maybe one day, it will it become as accepted as PayPal for international payments.

As a freelancer I've been thinking about this myself, but unfortunately the infrastructure for a smooth client side process is not really there yet. But if you have an ongoing relationship with this company and they are willing to be flexible, you could offer them a 1-2% discount on paying in btc and provide help for them on how best to acquire some. They would then send them to your address and you could sell them at your discretion on local bitcoins, where you usually get a markup on the exchange rate price. You could even keep some for those purchases you can already  make with btc, or even hold some if you're feeling bullish. There would be a learning curve for your client and yourself, but if it's a long term scenario, it could probably benefit both of you.

Far too much is being made out this IMO. I regularly shop at Amazon.co.uk from mainland Europe. Prices are naturally listed in pounds and I pay in Euros. Does that mean that the Euro is a payment conduit? Of course not. And if I return an item, I get back the listed price converted into Euros on the day of transfer. Some times it's a little more, some times a little less. You're making too much of a drama out of this.

Totally. That's what I do. I just meant in the context of this discussion.

I currently subscribe to Netflix.uk over a VPN. I want to get Netflix.us for greater choice, but I heard you need a us based credit card. Are you saying it's possible to pay with gift vouchers? If so, you mind telling me which ones? Thanks!

@_date: 2014-01-07 18:32:32
That is true! And it stops me from making major purchases in BTC atm. That's just how it is right now. Hopefully it will change in the near future. But exactly the same applies to other currencies around the world.

After all the excitement on this subreddit today there a few people who could certainly benefit from a calming cup of tea. ;)

It's still difficult to pay with debit card in Germany. When I left the UK 13 years ago, I could pay at the local cornershop with my visa. Recently, I went I tried to pay at a restaurant with my debit card, to be told they only accept cash. Granted, that's unusual, but Aldi only started accepting debut cards about 8 years ago or so, and that's a national chain. Germany is just extremely conservative and slow at adopting. Just look at the television programming to see what the majority of the country outside of the cities is like. Even if Bitcoin achieves since kind of mainstream adoption in Europe, Germany will be at the end of it.

How is this FUD? The article is even somewhat optimistic towards BTCs long term prospects.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:09:33
True, but normally send an invoice to the contractor who prints it, signs off on it and passes it on to accounts. These are obstacles that can be overcome, but it makes me realise how btc is still not simple to implement as a payment option in this context.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:10:27
Ha. Yeah irony is tricky online.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:18:27
As I understand it, even that allows the vendor to save in terms of credit card or PayPal charges. So, even in the vendor isn't a "Bitcoin believer" they can still save money using it.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:02:10
Thanks. I'll keep an eye out for that. I've belatedly realised that you need a third party for something like this because I issue an issue and could always claim that I never received the money. With legacy banking there is a trail. But if I did it strictly p2p the client has to trust me.

I was wondering how long it would take for pictures of cats to make their way into this subreddit ;) 
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:05:32
Yeah, for purely promoting btc to my clients this makes sense, but being unable to include a simple way to pay with tracking and invoice number highlights the convenience of legacy banking in comparison.
