Mt. Gox is NOT the place to be anonymous.  They have a pretty well documented history of being anal about ID verification with withdrawals. I wish people would realize that so things like this wouldn't happen.
I feel for you because it's pretty shitty of them to allow people to create accounts on TOR if they are going to lock their accounts when they try and withdraw using the same method. But at the same time if you had done your homework you could have avoided this situation.

This guy cracked the Da Vinci code. And to think, the answers were on the website the whole time.

So if I ever wanted to take my bitcoins with me (and not my computer) I could copy the wallet.dat file onto a usb drive and then find a clean computer (in the sense nobody else's wallet is on there) and D/L the bitcoin client and then overwrite the wallet.dat file?
Assuming I did something like this should I wipe the original wallet.dat file off my cpu as to not confuse the network by having two out there?
Thanks again for the help

Cool. Ya I don't plan on doing the USB thing. Just using it as a hypothetical to help me understand how it all works.
