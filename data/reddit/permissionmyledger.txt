There are tens of thousands of us who "understand the fundamental problems" and have been deeply involved in Bitcoin for five or more years.  We've been censored, banned, and the Bitcoin developers who represented us, the ORIGINAL developers who made it what it is today, Gavin, Gazrik, Malmi, others, they've all been forced out.
Don't speak to me like I'm some sort of child. I know a whole hell of a lot more about Bitcoin than you, Greg Maxwell, or Adam Back. This type of authoritarian technocratic BS is the reason we're going to end up with a split. Here's the bitch though, we're taking the miners and infrastructure with us. Core and Blockstream have put down and mislead too many people for too long. 
I look forward to dumping my BlockstreamCoreCoin for real Bitcoin someday soon on an exchange near you. Cheers, mother@

You wrote an FAQ for vaporware.
Call me when you can send Bitcoin to someone else directly with the lightning network through hubs that are just as hard to censor as downloadable software.
In the mean time, no more keeping Bitcoin, which we know works today, small and without scale/adoption.

Justify this position using facts and numbers.
I can justify the opposite position. Most software never makes it to commercial success. Lightning Networks is a cool idea, but so far it doesn't exist or work like Bitcoin does today. When it does work (and I believe it will, someday), right now there is no way to prevent centralization / larger hubs. Larger hubs will be regulated. If this happens, and there is no alternative, we've just ruined bitcoin's homogeneity and fungibility, destroying its usefulness as a currency. 
Effectively, the current development path Core is on will downgrade Bitcoin to Ripple with banks as hubs. That's not what I want. You shouldn't want it either.
What I want is Bitcoin working, with Lightning/payment channels available for specific use cases, like exchanges or groups that move a lot of transactions directly. I do NOT want payment channels to replace Bitcoin transactions between normal people, or to make Bitcoin too expensive to compete with bank transactions and cards.
No, this doesn't mean I want to buy coffee with bitcoin. It means I want bitcoin to be able to bank the world's 1.5 billion unbanked poor people, and be a decentralized form of currency that just works without friction.
Complete focus on Lightning Network while letting Bitcoin die of suffocation is destroying all of the things that are exciting about Bitcoin, and it's most crucial features, it's ability to act as currency that is fungible and censorship resistant.
I could NOT disagree with you more. I think you should leave Bitcoin and go work on Ripple, Ethereum, or R3 CEV.

I'm talking about system memory of 16GB being common, not hard drive space. Do you understand the difference?


Read the above again.


Again, minimum system requirements. Not dogma and all or nothing statements like "limit nodes to hard core user". This is where the debate goes off the road again and again. That said, it would be retarded to require full nodes to run on shitty computers or mobile phones. Normal people will use SPV wallets. There are more than enough hard core users (i.e. tens of millions around the world) that will be able to run a full node if we keep the spec to high end gaming rigs.


Show me where this is documented, please. I don't believe you, and if it is true, then a four year old computer is one year from being obsolete. Who chose this arbitrary number, and why was there no discussion with users? 


Now you've crossed the line into FUD.
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:36:23
Do you define 'innovation' as turning Bitcoin into a private settlement system with high fees and regulation?
Because that's what a hub and spoke model (lightning network) naturally does. Lock up more bitcoin, open more channels, make more lightning transactions, get bigger, become a major hub, big enough to regulate, BAM. Banks 2.0.
No thank you. We need Bitcoin AND Lightning Networks, not Lightning Networks and Bitcoin with $100.00 fees that only bank hubs can afford to use to bulk settle their payment channels.
Core needs to stop taking so much money from Blockstream and put some actual Bitcoin scaling into the roadmap. All we've seen since Blockstream raised their first $21m is work focused on making Blockstream money (RBF, SWSF). No scaling. It got far worse with the second $55m.

You've responded with a long bunch of bullshit text and some bullets.
Where is the application I can go download on my computer that will send a lightning payment through hubs/lightning network using onion or flare routing, presumably, and route 10 BTC to a receiver through an open payment channel?
What you are asking me to do is send a Bitcoin transaction to an address. That is not the lightning network.

@_date: 2016-11-28 23:26:05


You said "A month. In two months it will be 32GB"
[As you can see from this graph of the UXTO over Bitcoin's history, that statement is ridiculous and no where close to 16GB.]( Even if it exceeded 16GB, most high end computers have an SDD supplementing a spin drive, and SDD's are also technically memory and damn fast.


That's because the blocksize limit is preventing Bitcoin from reaching more users, no one wants to invest VC money because there is too much risk of no growth, and Lightning Networks are a long shot at best, and probably can't replace Bitcoin as a primary way to send money peer to peer.


No, I want there to be minimum system requirements we agree upon to run a full node that change from year to year. Gamers have been upgrading their PC's for 20 years to keep up with the latest software. We should be doing the same thing for full nodes. Hell, if we let Bitcoin actually grow a bit, there WILL be specialized PCI 3.0 Express 16x cards that are built to do nothing but run a full Bitcoin Node, with memory on the card to handle the UXTO, using the system hard drive for the blockchain. I'm sort of speechless that we haven't increased the max block size at this point. It's bordering on insanity given the possibilities if we optimize while we scale.


I think that you are trying to make people afraid and haven't provided any meaningful information about how you would accomplish this. What is "A full block."? 
Are you telling me that there is some new attack vector that no one has addressed in a dozen different ways already across Bitcoin core, XT, Classic, Unlimited, or the 100 other implementations that are running on mainnet?
@_date: 2016-11-30 15:30:05
It is NOT the same as increasing the blocksize!
1) increases aren't immediately available, only as others do work to reprogram their wallets/exchanges to support it
2) It creates two different sets of pricing for block space. Full price for regular transactions, and 75% off, that's right, 25% of the full price for Segregated Witness transaction data, i.e. the signature data.
This means SW transactions are cheaper than normal ones.
That extra space that is cheaper and only holds scripts and signatures? It's not going to be used to fit more transactions in blocks, it will be used to bloat up the bitcoin blockchain with complex scripts needed to support Lightning and side chains, both of which carry centralization concerns!
Comparing this to a simple 2MB increase is insane. Seriously insane. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 06:57:40
Printing money is a nice way to control people when you aren't at war, but ultimately any fiat currency's value is a proxy for the power of the authority backing it. That power is based on control of resources, and is secured from force. As long as governments require taxes to be paid in currency they issue, and the alternative to not paying taxes is jail, well, there you have it. Sorry, Bitcoin will not get rid of States. Because, men with guns and nukes. /thread

@_date: 2016-11-29 04:22:44
This is the source of the rift in the community. No one believes core will actually increase the blocksize. Moreover, most were expecting SegWit as a HF with the 2x blocksize increase, not shell games creating more block space for SegWit data, giving that data a 75% discount vs. other transaction space (without any discussion with the broader community), and calling that a blocksize increase. We already had trust issues, making the paper napkin sketch of blockstream come true with this 75% discount isn't helping!
Core should fully commit to a 2MB HF next. Not MAST, not other crap, a straightforward, no tricks, blocksize increase. That would be the best next step for everyone involved. Better yet, scaling that automatically just happens, similar to BIP101.
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:25:51
Wow. 
Bitcoin has steadily grown for 8 years. You can't dispute this fact, because, it's public data.
The blocksize has also steadily grown, and started to hit the 1MB limit about 7 months ago.
It is irrelevant if you think this is a "spam attack" or not, or if you blame a forum (which is insane, it's a forum not an organization), or a development team (which is ridiculous, and a shitty thing to do).
The fact is, we now have a steady volume of Bitcoin transactions that runs at close to max capacity. If the block solution rate slows down, or if someone transmits more transactions than normal, it will cause a backlog.
The refusal of core to increase the limit has made Bitcoin vulnerable. It is irrelevant whether they are spam or not. Core dropped the ball. This is why so many people are pissed off over at and why the China community is ready to throw core out and adopt BU. 
Keep calling it spam and do nothing. We'll switch to BU. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:29:07
I would like to take this opportunity to point out that:
1) There is no lightning network
2) Writing an FAQ seems a bit premature
3) Pointing out the obvious doesn't make me a troll, and 
4) We should also make sure Bitcoin itself still works reliably and doesn't cost a fortune, seeing as it is the only way to pay someone using Bitcoin right now.

Care to comment on my statement that malleability isn't actually a big deal for normal Bitcoin use?
Also, what do you think happens to Bitcoin when sending a transaction costs $100 in fees, and the only way to send money is using LN (hub and spoke), which routes naturally through the largest hubs with many channels and much bitcoin locked up (faster, lower cost), making hubs a target for regulators (converting them to banks 2.0)?

I'm not against this. Let's pay blockstream to go away. We can afford a 10x. Everyone sells 7% of their BTC for USD, wires it to Blockstream with the requirement that they dissolve their company and all officers/employees sign an agreement that they will not work in any cryptocurrency for 2 years, they make a 10x on their $76m investment, and the price goes to the moon. Deal.

Funny, there doesn't seem to be a "Lightning pay" option with any of my wallets. How do I route to this address via the Lightning Network through imaginary decentralized, censorship resistant, unregulatable lightning hubs that don't exist?
By the way... and joking aside, that's a P2PKH Bitcoin address. If you were going to try and seriously fool people into thinking lightning network was actually real, you could have at least used a P2SH address beginning with 3.
Nice try. You lose.

Malleability isn't technical debt, and SegWit as a soft fork introduces MUCH more technical debt than fixing malleability would ever solve. Malleability isn't a major or even moderate problem for Bitcoin! 
Do you even know what transaction malleability is? It's the fact that the protocol lets you modify some data elements around the digital signature without modifying the signature itself. Some clever scammers used this to modify transactions so the transaction ID didn't show up to exchanges, when they had in fact been sent Bitcoin. It was easily fixed when the exchanges upgraded their transaction search tools years and years ago!  
Malleability isn't about technical debt, it's a blocker for Lightning Networks and Sidechains ^TM, both of which are central to Blockstream's plans to milk the Bitcoin network for revenue. 
Well, LN doesn't thave a decentralized routing mechanism in place that would truly displace the need for L1 Bitcoin payments, and Sidechains have serious technical shortcomings as well, but here we go again, putting all our chips on the bets that Blockstream wants to make, regardless of whether it benefits Bitcoin.
I'm tired of this. Really tired. All that MAST stuff? It is CRAP in the context of making Bitcoin bigger and better. It's stuff that Blockstream needs to make an ROI. It's CRAP for Bitcoin. I'm tired of watching Bitcoin bleed out.

The people running things now are not more qualified than Gavin. That's a subjective statement. 
The fact that you, as a moderator, would take to this kind of toxic smearing about the guy who Satoshi trusted with the project really makes me wonder about your motivations. Attacking the people who built Bitcoin and dividing the community is not in Bitcoin's best interests.
And face the facts, when Gavin oversaw the project we saw a huge growth, more and more users, and over a billion dollars in VC money pouring in. There was a huge sense of optimism about the possibilities. 
With him gone, usage has gone sideways, we haven't accomplished any kind of scaling, VC investment has literally fallen off a cliff, there's censorship everywhere, and you can't even talk about Bitcoin without having your thoughts attacked by shills and trolls, or your character assassinated if you are brave (foolish) enough to reveal your real identity. 
If Gavin is less qualified to lead the Bitcoin project, then give me back the amateurs!

Greg Maxwell is not a reputable source for anything related to Bitcoin, especially involving the term "fork". He has a history of distorting the truth in order to rewrite history to benefit the interests of the company he works for, Blockstream.
Using the commonly accepted definition of "hard fork", there were no fewer than two (2) hard forks in Bitcoin's history. They were widely described as such just after they occurred. 
[The first occurred in August of 2010. Read the details, it was a very HARD fork.](
[The second occurred in March of 2013, where a miner running version 0.8.0 created a large block (at height 225,430) that was incompatible with earlier versions of Bitcoin. Incompatible with earlier versions is the DEFINITION of a hard fork.](

Na. 16GB of system memory is common now. Heck, video cards are shipping with 6-8GB. Hard drives are 2TB or 4TB. 


Hard core users will dedicate more than 1/2 their hard drive to run Bitcoin. I know enough of them to verify this. To be a real threat to decentralization the cost must be above the cost of a high end gaming machine.


Again... don't underestimate the hard core users, they will most certainly string up 2 or 4 HDD's into a RAID0 array. Bitcoin users are mostly geeks.
I think these sorts of statements are a glaring example of why we need to agree to a set of **minimum system requirements** to run a full node and target our scaling ambitions to that set of system specs.

The Bitcoin S&amp;L case and Schrem didn't have any corrupt cops I guess, but the fact that the biggest and second biggest cases in Bitcoin had corrupt cops deeply involved is really unnerving.
