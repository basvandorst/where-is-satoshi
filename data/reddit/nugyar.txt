There's an important distinction between bullion pieces and numismatic pieces.
Gold numismatic pieces are regularly sold for a full markup (e.g. 1oz numismatic piece sells for the price of 2oz bullion).
Silver numismatics usually sell for a 500% markup (e.g. 1oz silver numismatic piece sells for the price of 5oz silver).

The question is whether the collector's premiums in terms of BTC will hold up. Today someone might pay 3 BTC for a 1 BTC round, or a $1,000 USD premium. In ten years' time when 1 BTC = $10,000, will anyone pay a $20,000 premium? For an ounce of silver, minted in 2013, which anyone could have counterfeited?
Considerations like this are why collectors who don't insist on PGP chains of custody are unwise.

The intersection of BTC and fiat makes the Bitcoin collectibles market a very interesting, very risky market to play in.
The newspaper in particular is an interesting piece. Old papers announcing, e.g., the moon landing are worth a lot of money for their historical significance, but many copies would have been saved because it was obviously a significant event.
The Times Jan 3 2009 was not in any way a remarkable issue, so most copies were destroyed long before the significance of that particular issue came to light. I recall Charlie Shrem saying that he had sold a copy for around 8 BTC at a conference.

Go ask a traditional numismatist whether they'd ever pay a $20,000 (EDIT: or even a $2,000) premium for a 1oz silver novelty round, e.g. SBSS. In fact, show this thread to ANY numismatics forum and see what they think.
It's also worth noting that counterfeiting privately-minuted rounds carries negligible legal risk, compared to counterfeiting fiat coins.

We do produce CMYK prints occasionally, generally for full-colour book covers, but I'm a big fan of really vivid colours, and most of the colours I work with are outside of the CMYK gamut.
Plus, you can't do split flood backgrounds then, and there are no more smooth vector lines, just halftone dots.
CMYK is great for some things, and definitely a lot less work than 15 spots, but there's just no replacement for gorgeous, smooth, bright spot-colour shapes. I don't mind spending the extra time and I think the extra care shows in the final product  :)
We're actually in the process right now of building a new aluminum-top vacuum table. M&amp;Rs are great but there's just no room for one... here... yet :)

Also worth noting (many readers may not know this), but the original 0.5.3 release (upon which 0.5.3.1 is built) predates the Vessenes/Karpeles phoundation. Throwing stolen GOX money at Gavin doesn't make them legitimate.

Some analysis of the larger bets
(Y/N  /  Weight  /  Wager):
Yes    100,000    1000.00000000
No    44,411    1500.00000000 (avg weight of six 250btc bets)
No    40,234    999.00000000
No    11,155    1401.95203057
First No:
(15000*.99)+(.99*(1500*1121*44411/144085882)) =  15363
Second No:
(999*.99)+(.99*(999*1121*40234/144085882)) = 1298
Third No:
(1401*.99)+(.99*(1401*1121*11155/144085882)) = 1507
Net profit from whale No bets: 763btc

I'm sure anyone who wished to push the code to git would be encouraged to do so. 
However, using PGP-signed patches has the added benefit of (hopefully) encouraging more people to use PGP, and also lets other users add their signature to a patch once they're satisfied that it does what it purports to, which helps bring WoT-style trust into the codebase.
