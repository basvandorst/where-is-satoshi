Like I said, watching the video above will show you the other side of the perspective, and why people support it.

So you're saying, cash is the problem? And changing the financial system will prevent all the crime you are mentioning above to end?

Sure.. tiny majority ... But what's your point?...ban it and arrest anyone that believes in digital cash? Keep letting banks launder money and fund crime? (and do the research, cause they launder more than crypto). 
It's a new technology that is changing the way people all over the world can access the market.

Is this Bitcoin CASH?

You should actually watch the video above to challenge your perspective.

Im still not getting what your argument is. 
Is it that you believe BTC should be worth nothing, so therefore it has to be? OR is it because bad guys can use it, it should be ban? if its the first,  that's not how the world works. You don't determine market value of technology that is 9 years old. I hate super hero movies, but they gross billions... oh well. 
 Bitcoin is more accessible to people than banking. That is a fact. If you have internet you can have Bitcoin. Not the same case as banks. And Bitcoin is a global system.. not tied in with some cases of corrupt government currency systems like Venezuela, Argentina, Greece, India, etc.. 
That is the advantage. Just because you live in the US and don't see value in it, doesn't make it useless for the world (or even a small community).

Childish. You added nothing to the community or world of crypto currency. Grow up.

We potentially lost out on new individuals getting cryptocurrency and contributing to the ecosystem. Period. Destroying ads of projects in a down market is the worst thing to do. No new users!!! We're too hip for that!! Cypherpunks not dead!!

Sure.. paying the interest and  destroying credit history aside... He might come out on top... In two or three years....

Show me one example?

Oh god that camera is so strong
