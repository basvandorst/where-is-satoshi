I've been mining off and on for quite a while.  After a while, bitcoin lost the excitement of a digital money system.  With the fact bitcoin is still liked to a fiat currency, the value, it didn't make any sense.   
I understand why people want bitcoin.  I have hopes that it becomes main stream.  The problem is the backing of all world currency.  No matter what people say, the value is still linked to a Fiat. It's not worth my time or money to get $20 worth of coins or spending $20 in my bank.

Funny, I'm getting out of it.  Selling my BFL miners the moment I get them.  I've also used all the BTC I had.

"Tonight at 7, 125m bitcoins stolen from infected computers..."
If bitcoin becomes main stream, we'll hear that.

I can have 100m bitcoin, but without a value, they're pizza worth.  
As for Fiat's value, its valued on peoples word.  Nothing but words are its value.

The US already said they're cool with Bitcoin.  For now at least.

I bought two of the 4.5gh/s models when they were $150 each.  Paid all in bit coins and never put a dime in.  If I don't make anything, oh well.

Good way to test if a SSL cert is fake or not.

How could that help the cops who are just as easily able to find?
In Chrome URL box, "cache:&lt;URL&gt;"

Step 1: Copy wallet into correct folder.
Step 2: Start Bitcoin
Step 3: Check "Addresses" 
Step 4: ???
Step 5: PROFIT!
