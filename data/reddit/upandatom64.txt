Gambler's fallacy

Bruh, gold, copper, you know every elements in the periodic table have different unique properties right?
Bruh, the basis of your argument why something has value is because it's rare/finite supply. Counter-arguing that having something like a "one-of-kind" snowflake, one in the world, making it valuable, is no real basis for an argument. Ability to uncensor something doesn't give it value.
Exactly, the only value is extrinsic. It only has value is because of adoption. All of the value is premium. Intrinsically, is worthless.
Attacking me rather than my argument, logical fallacy, ad hominem, nice.
Good luck mate in your future endeavors, I ain't gonna going back and forth with you all day.

Are you saying "Got Bitcoin?!" because it has a limited supply(inflationary proof after a certain amount of time) or because it has "value"? Bitcoin has the same intrinsic value as USD fiat, zero. Bitcoin is pretty much online fiat.
If you are about downvote this, Open your mind for atleast 5 seconds and think about what I said.

"liquid"?? Do you mean divisible?
Not sure but I think you can make a gold alloy coin containing 0.000000000xxxxxxxxxx% gold to buy those eggs you are talking about.
As for the "people stopped", that's like cash/ credit cards, convenience

Let's keep this short.
Gold has intrinsic value because of it's uses/properties; also has extrinsic...(Gold/precious metals= special...too long to explain)
Blockchain technology is awesome. But, Bitcoin has no more intrinsic value than zynga poker chips or runescape gold; all of it's value is extrinsic.
People often bring the argument of a infinite supply to support their argument. That's like saying that "one-of-kind" snowflake/art has intrinsic value. Scenario; Someone just has to have the "one-of-kind" snowflake and is willing to pay $100 bn for it, then snowflake would be worth $100 bn. You could theoretically make the argument that the "one-of-kind" snowflake is worth more than the other snowflake around you; but lets not go into that rabbit hole. Value is still extrinsic.

Do you have to follow him on twitter to vote on the poll? That's the question to support op's title.

I think I die a little inside every time someone compares bitcoin to gold. Seems like they regurgitate stuff they hear other people say, while not truly understanding what they are saying. I have literally heard my brother make those statements.

Government make their own currency, people make their own coins all the time. Depending on how anal you want to be testing a coin, acid test, purity, plus weight, testing for density,. Pretty sure google has many other methods of testing a coin. Gold is continuously divisible to one atom, bruh. You don't need a central bank to make you own coin. Credit cards were create as a convenience for fiat. Fiat was created as a convenience for gold. Illiquid and divisible mean two different things.
Good luck mate in your future endeavors, I ain't gonna going back and forth with you all day.

Pretty sure roosters come from eggs

skimmed thru
The argument is that just because there is a limited supply of something doesn't give it intrinsic value. I can have a one-of-kind snowflake/art. Someone can pay 100bn for the snowflake and it would be worth 100bn. Practically, all of it value is extrinsic, unless you want to drink your snowflake etc.
