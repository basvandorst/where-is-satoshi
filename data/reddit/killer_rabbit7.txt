Thanks! Yeah that is the issue with making these videos. I don’t know how detailed I should make it. I almost need to make a separate video for what a crypto wallets/paper wallets/hardware wallets/software wallets. Each one would have more detailed examples. This video is simply a broad overview.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:31:17
I definitely want to do both. Channel is still new but I’m aiming to combine both topics of tech/finance to help retail investors and normal people manage their finances. Cryptocurrency fits that hybrid perfectly, which is why I find it so fascinating to discuss. Yeah I want to appeal to a variety of audiences (probably not the super tech savvy viewers). I could always just put a tag in each title such as “beginner” or “detailed explanation” or create video playlists.

Congrats on the gains! Are you you re-balancing your portfolio or just letting it ride?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:58:50
Those are some great ideas for videos! I’ll add it to my list of projects.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:30:29
No you can cancel the order if you want to replace it or just get rid of it!

Hey man just made a video about managing risk/expectations in crypto investing if you want to check it out! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:53:33
I made a video about the different wallets that can used to store crypto. The safest option is a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:44:31
True true. Just my opinion backed with some reasoning, but then again I am just some random guy. I always like to discuss opposing ideas to my own in terms of where we are and other people's exit strategies over the long-term.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:19:31
Haha when I say “high level”, I just mean I’m not going to get into the details of the algorithms and mathematics behind how the bitcoin protocol. Yeah that’s the level of detail I could go into for the different kind of wallets as well (including the multi-sig options).
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:11:43
I suggest getting a hardware wallet, as I believe it has the most security. I have a ledger nano s which has worked well for me. I linked the website on the video description. It really depends on what kind of wallet your looking for/if your trying to spend money or not.

Found this answer when looking up your question 
“First you will need to import the paper wallet private key (the secret part) into a software wallet.
With MyCelium (Android/iOS):
Select the Accounts tab.
Tap the three dots menu and pick Cold Storage.
Tap QR Code and scan the paper wallet private key.
With the Blockain.info app (Android, IOS):
On the sidemenu tap Addresses:
Tap the Add button (+).
Select Import Address and scan the QR Code of the private key.
❌ Important: Once the coins are moved from the paper wallet to your software wallet, make sure you never ever use the paper wallet address again, on purpose or by accident. Don't try to only transfer part of the funds from the paper wallet — most likely you'll lose the rest (most wallets don't allow partial transfers anyway).
Once you have transferred the assets from the paper wallet to your software wallet, funds can be transferred to/from another person using the Send/Receive options in the app.
Keep in mind that if you are using an offline wallet such as MyCelium then the damage or loss of device will result in losing the coins, unless you backed up the seed and stored it in a safe place. Same applies to online wallets, such as blockchain.info: if you forgot your password and didn't export your secret seed, then the funds will be irrecoverably lost.”
Hopefully that helps!

Holy shit I hear you. The amount of risk people take when it comes to crypto scares me. It’s a speculative bet and people treat it like it is guaranteed positive returns. My next video was going to be about risk management/allocation %/ portfolio rebalancing.

He’s saying bitcoin isn’t a currency if you’re always converting it back to the USD value. Which he is right for now, but one day in the future we may value everything in bitcoin. The only reason people are making money from bitcoin is because it is a new technology/currency nowhere near mass adoption (which at that point won’t have great returns do to the low risk/stable value).

If you get audited they would ask where the extra $5000 came from
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:31:27
True. In the video I said for small amounts, the convenience of leaving it on an exchange makes sense. An exchange wallet can be thought of as a checking account while a hardware wallet is like your savings account!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:35:21
Yeah I shoot for 10% which is on the higher side, but I'm younger and no one depends on me so I feel like I can carry more risk with my investments.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:10
Unfortunately it is post only, otherwise I would sell a market order and get filled at these insane prices 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:52:17
Yeah if it is an amount that is causing lost sleep, it is probably too much. Good on you to diversify across some safer asset classes (stocks not the alts lol).
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:25:08
I guess if it is in cash, and he only ever spends it in cash on small items over time he could probably get away with it. But I don’t know if local bitcoins reports anything to the IRS about account holdings. But still it’s not worth the risk of getting caught. To each their own.

You never sell. Just hodl till you die.  /s

Tried posting, but it got rejected as the link has been posted too many times��
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:20:07
lol fair enough, everyone has a right to their own opinion. I mean I do still own bitcoin because I believe it has a future unlike Jamie Dimon.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:21:58
That was only one point in my video about forced spending to "stimulate". What about the complexity issue, central entity infrastructure, regulation, price stabilization, and transaction fees/verification times?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:21:15
Yeah I’m having the same issue with ETH getting moved from gdax to my coinbase wallet. I submitted a ticket and will try agin tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:30:16
Interesting. Do you have a good video/article that explains the intricacies of how it works?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:44:09
Thanks I enjoyed the video! Now I understand you simply can’t increase the block size, but I still don’t know how exactly off-chain transactions can occur and not run into the issue of double spending. I’ll have to do more research I suppose.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:56:19
Because of volume issues haha or you just disagree with what I was saying?
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:26:50
I think it is healthy to bring up the potential issues and figure the best ways to fix them instead of just ignoring them and saying bitcoin is the best thing that has ever been created and will achieve world peace.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:50:50
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:57:21
Also the original design/whitepaper was to be a currency not a store of value like gold.
@_date: 2019-04-19 13:53:52
Crunchywetleaves, there is no convincing this troll. Don’t bother wasting your time.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:14:04
Well ICO's are competition to bitcoin. I believe ICOs that are legitimate are good for the market. Competition creates innovation and efficient markets.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:08:57
I would say a ban on ICOs is regulation. Basically any influence from government entities in the cryptocurrency space I would consider regulation.
Anti regulation would be let the markets manage themselves and let it be the Wild Wild West. Let those investors that invest is scam ICOs loose their investment and learn their lesson the hard way because they skipped due diligence. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:35:02
Yeah that is a valid point. I think there is a difference between regulation and an all out ban of ICOs. I lean towards slight regulation to prevent people getting scammed and hurt financially. No one should be held at gunpoint or arrested for trading crypto. The scammy ICOs should on the other hand get in trouble for peddling fraudulent tokens.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:29:22
What does that have to do with ICO regulation?
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:11:33
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:28:43
I definitely agree that some of the ICO's are scams. That is why some regulation would be good for the markets, as it prevents as you call it "phantom value". I just hope that over regulation doesn't inhibit developers that have revolutionary ideas!
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:36:22
Haha yeah
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:15:55
 watch my video to use gdax and buy bitcoin without any fees. You are already ahead of the game with a coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:32:50
I actually did a whole video on how to buy/sell cryptocurrencies for free on GDAX. Give it a watch if you want :) 
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:57:31
I understand from a PR standpoint it looks good and attracts customers, but if they continue to grow as the got to exchange for cryptocurrency they may be the target of more market manipulation.
With a growing customer base, are they going to bail people out every time someone attempts to manipulate the market?
