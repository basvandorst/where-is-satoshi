Naively syncing 4 nodes independently is going to soak up 4 x 250GB over the internet. Just sync 1; that will require 1 x 250 GB. Then when it's done, copy the blockchain over to the other 3. Or just point the other 3 at the one that is synced until they are synced. 
The BTC p2p network has a finite bandwidth available to supply the blockchain. Doing it your way is using up 4x more than necessary.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:40:58
OK right, 150 GB. I meant, whatever the size of the blockchain is ATM. I was too lazy to check.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:44:07
Well it's also a concern because if you download 4x more than necessary you are crowding out everyone else who is trying to sync and thereby slowing everyone down. Most full nodes throttle/limit the GB per day they're willing to upload.

Unless your business model is collecting a lot LN fees. In which case securing your IT  infrastructure is a big part of the value you bring, and isn't all that expensive. Banks are already the kind of target your refer to, and know how to do security.

Technically there's nothing to prevent travelling faster than the speed of meme. It's just that under normal circumstances price-dilation effects make it harder and harder to accelerate the closer you get, such that one can approach it, but never attain it.

Could I ask for a bit of clarification please? There are Bitcoin ABC nodes talking to Satoshi nodes at the moment. So a transaction broadcast on the BTC network also gets relayed to ABC nodes, who would presumably still try to include them in blocks they mine. So what's the mechanism that prevents sending coin to an address from having  effect on both chains?
Ultimately the ABC nodes will get blocks relayed to them that they see as invalid, coming from core Satoshi nodes, and vice versa, and they will ban each other. But in the mean time, I don't see why a broadcasted transaction doesn't happen on both chains.
Sorry if that's a stupid question.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:22:35
I don't think they got the reference. Whoosh :)
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:00:48
Don't take it anywhere. An unencrypted wallet will as likely as not be stolen. Just take the hard drive out and plug it in to the machine you're using now. If you don't know how, learn how. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:47:15
Thanks, I'm all over this!
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:58:03
Thanks. Hmm. I guess you're suggesting the nodes have some way detecting that the block that was relayed to them from the non-compatible node is "foreign", which is distinct from invalid block for the non-foreign chain it knows about, and thus not a banning offense. I guess I could look at the code. I'm obviously ignorant of the details.
A weird state of affairs to my eyes. I speculate they use the same seeder infrastructure Satoshi nodes use to find peers.  Of the 112 peers I see at the moment, only two are ABC. So they would run a real risk of starting up and finding nothing but Satoshi nodes to talk to, which doesn't do them any good. And in the mean time we and they waste bandwidth sending things neither side cares about?
Seems it would be happier for both sides if they would just fork off and leave us alone, and just talk to each other.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:52:33


I don't think so. My impression (I'm not an expert) is that In the spoke and hub model, you open a channel with a hub.  Hubs will already have open channels with each other (or enough other hubs) so that lightning payments find a route through the network to anyone (who also has a channel open to a hub).

This is likely a [bip 39]( 12-word seed for a wallet. If so, you should be able to restore by creating a new wallet using any bip39-supporting wallet. E.g. breadwallet, mycellium. 
I wouldn't go entering this info into any website.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:07:43


Ah, that makes sense.


I've got a peer that is an ABC node connected for almost 7 hours, and I'd think I would send it roughly 6 blocks per hour that it must think are invalid, and it's still talking to me. I've sent it almost a gig of data, and it has sent me about 344KB. So perhaps it's merely in the mode of downloading a copy of the blockchain, and won't notice the "invalid" blocks until it catches up.
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:17:19
Hmm, perhaps not bip 39 then.
Sorry. Try to remember what wallet or website you were using? Look for other emails around that time; perhaps they sent you one.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:37:02
Thanks nullc. Dropping the knowledge bombs! 


I always had suspicions about peers that I send a ton of data to, but I only ever receive a few KB from. Spies are they? I toyed with the idea of hacking the source a bit to allow me to detect and drop the miscreants, but didn't invest the time to understand the code or understand what was going on exactly. And got fiber, so it stopped being an immediate problem.
@_date: 2017-01-16 09:45:58


No, I'm opposed to large blocks that force centralization into a handful of data-center-sized full nodes.
One side of the fork will survive, the other will ultimately be worthless. The one that survives will be the one with lightning network + segwit. 
And in the mean time, we can get back to Satoshi's vision where every full node is also a miner, assuming the new hashing algorithm is ASIC- (and GPU?-) resistant.
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:01:01
I doubt it was 2009. I don't think tradehill existed then. Are you sure it was a web wallet? I see them referring to the core client here:
If that's what you were using, and the computer died, check to see if the hard drive in that machine is still readable, if you still have it. The wallet.dat would have been stored on it.

A corp would likely use multi-signature addresses. M-of-N (e.g. 3 of 5 or whatever they choose) officers or other appointees must each sign with their private keys.

1. Yes, pull the [0.14 branch]( not master.
2. Yes
3. You don't need to do that.  Just run it with the same command-line arguments you would run core bitcoin-qt. You can use `-datadir` to point it at your existing downloaded chain.
OP is talking about the equivalent of "putting a bumper sticker on your car" as mentioned above while still only running core. Running a BIP148 UASF node is doing something with more significance.

This particular topic might fit better, and get more attention, over on or A bitcoin topic I would like to see the counselor address is: what is the legal status of a bitcoin lightning node?
