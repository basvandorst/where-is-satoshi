Blockfolio is a tracker non related linked to your real holdings. It means that you will set a buy trade and the app will ask u at what price and how many coins.
This will calculate your USD profit/loss thanks to this formula (real time price trade multiply by nb of coins minus price traded multiply by nb of coins).
On a daily basis you will track real time USD price
Check youtube its easy to use

France and Germany are working together on the crypto regulation for upcoming G20. However, it seems like France isnt overall in favor and is going to regulate it strictly

Are you willing to sell btc if it hits 50k?
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:28:04
so funny
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:35:34
Bitcoin has value : 1. Limited coins 2. Decentralized 3. Mining cost which gives a minimum cost and not only speculative price 4. No more intermediate
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:57:21
Simole. Since you borrowed a total of 50k, if BTC price drops from 20k to 7k, then the break even should be 14k, right?
However you did not spent the first time 25K into BTC but $16250 since you withdrew $8750 to pay your loan (which I guess isnt related to BTC loan money otherwise the rate is absurd).
Following this scenario, you invested 25k at a lower price and 16k at a higher price, hence the break even is not 14k anymore but lower

Random holders have no interest in dumping BTC price. It is mostly manipulated by whales/institutions to transfer the money from wallets to wallets

Kraken.com : buy bitcoin
Just download blockfolio app it only shows your holding when u parameter it. Nothing related to your real bitcoin holdings

@_date: 2018-02-04 12:19:09
This may also be a good point. Imagine a lot of people buying with their life savings and more. The day there will be huge correction people might panic sell and make a worst reputation to crypto as they lost a lot

Not to mention E.Macron was planning 62% tax on crypto gains. Even if it is not confirmed and I think it was certainly to create fear among the community, we can see the trend

I think they got involved and lost money which explains anger. There are other possibilities : 
refusing new tech, have no knowledge, don't want to see people earn money.
I know some people still thinking bitcoin is only a gamble like sport betting, not knowing there is tech behind.
