Companies in the US are forced to accept OUR official currency. That is the USD. If you go and try to buy something at a store with another countries currency they will look at you like you are crazy and ask you for USD. Go ahead, go try it.

sooo you want to live in america.... and use another countries currency??? yeah good luck. Also, you should think about the fact that some OTHER countries use the US dollar as their currency, or a secondary form of currency, because their national currency is that unstable.
