Ok maybe not, but this is what Satoshit did with a  CHAIN and eventually BLOCKED his anus causing an anomaly right up his arse and eventually coined the term Blockchain.

The logo contains three important meanings.
The first, Swiss origin of the company. The logo is rendered in the colors of the national flag and the famous Swiss cross can be seen formed by the gaps between its elements.
The second, cryptocurrency. The logo clearly exhibits the bitcoin symbol with its characteristic vertical serifs.
And finally, a metaphor for profits. The straight line between the serifs symbolizes the road to a bright financial future awaiting anyone who decides to invest in cryptofinance.

Believe it or not English would appeal to global audience. If the ad was in your native language and OP would have posted that here there would have hardly been any traction besides that from the native speakers.
