Not surprising at all when you learn it's founded by a Goldman Sachs guy.

Exactly the same happened to me. Canceled my account right away. Don't care if Coinbase is the "cool" Bitcoin startup—its automated issue-handling process is ABUSIVE (i.e. just siphon money away from any and all bank accounts and credit cards on file) and its customer support is ABSENT.

Why does an issue have to be reported in public forums like this before it gets your attention?

By the way, **the co-founder is a Goldman Sachs alumnus**

Cannot agree with this more. Can't believe people here are so naive.
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:37:36
Stop being so arrogant. You fucked it up.
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:32:56
This happened to me as well.

Coinbase is NOT Bitcoin.

You obviously haven't dealt with Coinbase's customer service before. It's completely understandable once you realize they would completely ignore issues like this until it's reported on the public forums.
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:28:35
You're kidding. Coinbase has no customer support. What they have is PR team pretending to be on top of the issues. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:16:57
Literally true. **The co-founder is a Goldman Sachs alumnus.**

My friend had an interview at Coinbase. This guy Ehrsam comes in with a plate of dumplings near the end, says nothings, just eats dumplings. I don't know, but you hear stories when you live in the Silicon Valley.
And then you learn he's from Goldman Sachs. And then it all makes sense how Coinbase has terrible customer support, and how they're focused on hyper-growth at all cost.
