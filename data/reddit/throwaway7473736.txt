I just read a lot about exchanges crashing or stealing the bitcoins of their customers, but I'll try to find out more about Kraken, thank you.

Not at all. I can Google my way out of most problems, but I'm feeling out of my depth here.

Thank you very much.

If possible, I'll retrieve the money tomorrow. I don't think people will steal it that soon..?

Thank you for the detailed explanation. I'll hold out until the upvotes are no longer hidden. Electrum seems to be recommended a lot so I think I'll use that. Any recommendations for an exchange? I read a lot of warnings about those as well..

Thank you, I'll take care not to post anything that could make me lose the bitcoin address. It's just 2 codes, 1 slightly longer. The shorter one leads to a blockchain link.

Yes, that looks similar. Thank you very much. I'll hold out on following advice until post votes are visible. I'll be more confident to follow it by then. Thanks again.

Slightly more than 0.01, so still a lot of debt unfortunately. But every little bit helps, so this is still a nice surprise in a sad situation.

I'll wait for a reaction to receive upvotes, so I'll feel better about following its advise. Thank you for looking out for me and I'm sorry for all that money you lost. That's rough.

Sending it to an exchange won't be too risky? And which exchange should I use? There are so many. I'm in Europe by the way.

I found 2 codes. One of them is the private key I think? I will try the Electrum thing if nobody objects here.. I'm kind of scared to do anything, with so many warnings, even here in this topic. Thank you for responding though, I really appreciate it.

The Netherlands.

Thank you very much.

A little more, but I have no idea how much the fees will be when I cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:30:00
Yes, the shorter one gives me the blockchain result on Google.

Thank you for the detailed answer. I'll look into coinbase first.
