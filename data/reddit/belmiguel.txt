Whats the transaction hash? Is stuck in the mempool?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:35:55
Because more hard drive is required and bitcoin does not incentivize the chain storage just the transaction processing. So at the end only “few” will be able to keep the chain data.

Put higher fees. There are calculators all over the internet. Base on that not on blocktrail default ones.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:05:12
There isnt much you can do apart from waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:41:40
Always hodl!
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:22:21
The transaction is finished? or stuck in the mempool?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:00:46
Predict future is complicated. Id say when this wave will pass.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:46:27
Because part of the hashpower moved to BCH since mining was more profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:15:13
how important is actually for the users of bitcoin the speed of transactions? For me, not much. I can wait hours without too much problem.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:34:37
Game changer.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:35:22
There are many.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:22:59
Then you were not right ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:34:31
Always hold!
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:05:27
Why it was needed?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:45:50
Bitcoin will  be fine, don't worry.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:09:59
You can use the btc.com one but If i would be you i wouldnt have too much faith.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:21:43
This things happen, is fine.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:42:14
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:48:17
Let's see what happens the next few weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:41:19
Not much u can do, best option is wait.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:26:44
Are you familiar with the term decentralization?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:03:49
Wait. You cant do anything else unless you want to double spend.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:31:57
Can you post the reference of the transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:40:39
Brave to say without taking into account the electricity price of the readers...
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:49:34
Run a full node. That should be enough.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:26:50
Maybe some market maker in your exchange. Or a big resistance.

@_date: 2017-07-12 17:27:00
One bank is not all banks.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:37:34
It is. Yes, you would not loose anything.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:56:52
Forks are bad for the business.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:33:19
They poured money into bitcoin? I dont like comapnies/people who do not put the money where their mouth is.
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:46:27
Coinbase should be okey but mind the fees (3-4%).
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:08:52
With 2 USD as fee should be minutes.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:32:39
The bitcoin enthusiasts of those countries should react and enforce the derogation of the bans. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:17:57
Yes or no.
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:41:42
No one cares.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:37:47
Repeated...
