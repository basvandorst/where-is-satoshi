Whatever makes you feel better.  Typical response from someone who missed the boat. I tell you what lets put your money where your mouth is.. 12/31/2018.. 1 BTC bet that the value of BTC is higher than today.
We can use a Ether smart contract as escrow.. Do you accept?
here you go cupcake.. i was slinging tents for bitcoins when you were wearing diapers.

the best day to invest in bitcoin was yesterday.. the next best day is today.. and it will always be this way.. if you're DCA, the price of today makes no difference. Which nearly every single person here should be doing. If you're making 1 purchase as an investment and hoping it goes of from that exact moment you're doing it very very very wrong.  If in turn you buy $50 a week every week, well then.

Listen kid, I was chatting with Satoshi when he was writing the first lines of code on IRC. Because I use throw away accounts doesn't mean I don't know bitcoin.
You have no clue who I am, or what I own so sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up.. The adults are in the room.
I was starting bitcoin business in the beginning when bitcoin was $10.. I sold a fucking Diablo III account for 13 BTC. So before you tell someone they don't know what they're doing based on a fucking reddit account date, check yourself home boy.
Sorry you're late to the party.
