The cards are stolen, and eBay will ban your account and often lay claim to repayment of the funds. Avoid, avoid, avoid.

Yeah, in the Whale Club Teamspeak someone described it as a "bitcoin rage."  So i'm getting the drift that he was screaming at his charts, neighbors called the cops cause it sounded like someone was being raped with an anvil, and then he just transitioned to screaming at the cops when they arrived.
To call him a "political prisoner" is a slap in the face of anybody who has ever suffered for their beliefs. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:58:11
Lol, this is the stupidest story ever, and anybody donating money is even stupider.
"Bitcoin Prisoner" / "Political Prisoner," oh please, that's such a lie. 
"While he was in his home, and had an open leveraged position Long in Bitcoin, the police arrived
to his home and he was passionately expressing his beliefs on the economy and political system, while advocating strongly for the use of bitcoin and decentralized systems."
^So he was in his own home, losing money trading bitcoin without stops, being so fucking loud that his neighbors called the cops on him, and when the cops showed up he transitioned into screaming at them.   &lt;--that's how the article should read.

Not happy that I have to upload my college transcripts in order to place a bid on a writing freelance project. You should make "verified" an optional tag. People could then opt to hire a verified "expert," or maybe pay verified experts more, but it's lame that I can't even bid on a job without giving you my college transcripts.

Or maybe... he's just sharing his opinion without concern for other's opinions. Wouldn't be the first time a public figure has shared a controversial personal opinion.

"For the most part, I will be choosing to avoid services which require alts. My personal opinion of course, but it seems to be one shared by many here."  Yeah, i'm not really sure the OP posted this here in the first place.  It's like handing out invitations to a hanukkah party at a mosque.

Almost there, buddy.

I don't make a practice of discussing altcoins on r/bitcoin because I know this isn't the correct forum for that, but since it's kind of on topic...

@_date: 2015-01-29 17:33:26
It's kinda' fucked up, because it's not yet completely clear whether or not BTC is a currency. For my part, I view it as not a currency, and am simply selling a commodity/digital token to someone else for cash.  But, who knows how that'd stand up before a judge.
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:15:02
Hell, I sell BTC for cash on LocalBitcoins.com, and I charge a 15% markup.  Lots of customers and no complaints yet!
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:11:03
This isn't about Quicksilver specifically, but more just BTC vs. Alts in general.  Bitcoin isn't the wheel.  Blockchains are the wheel. 
Most altcoin projects aren't reinventing the wheel, they're just taking the standard wheel design and customizing it for their specific use.  Kinda' like all-terrain tires, racing slicks, pulley wheels, etc.... Not reinventions, but just customizations. 
Cryptocurrency is such a new and exciting field, it's a damn shame to view Bitcoin as the "end all."  Plenty of room for people to build unique projects and innovate in their own way.
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:24:16
Because where i live most drugs are still illegal, and if someone told me that they were going to use the BTC to purchase drugs, then I would not sell to them.  Not worth being viewed as an accessory to a crime, etc. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:32:11
I'll have to check bitquick.co out. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:40:45
Well that's why it's kinda' fucked up.  IRS says its property, but several judges have ruled that it is currency--the government (US) hasn't been very consistent thus far. Regardless, i'd just as soon not risk it. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:28:42
that change is "your money."  Seems a bit different than selling someone BTC. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:54:50
I do not condone people using BTC for drugs, and do not sell to people who express this as their intent.  
A couple customers have been forex traders who wanted to try out BTC, a couple hipsters who are fleeing the dollar, and several people I couldn't place. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:47:52
I knew it was coming, but it still made me laugh.  Zero chance it was BTC, based off the original teaser video.

on the left hand side there should be a link for "other ways to give." Click that, and it brings up lots of less popular ways of donating, such as money order, check, wire transfer, and Bitcoin.

Buy up the majority of a small and mostly dead altcoin (there are plenty of options). Then start pumping the altcoin with your Bitcoins. Look at coinmarketcap.com, there are a number of super shitty altcoins with a $1million+ marketcap.  Then cash out Bitcoins and claim them as profits from the altcoin pump. Do this a couple times, and you'll be fine.
You'd have to pay taxes on the Bitcoins you cash out (probably capital gains tax), but it'd work. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 22:20:04
Assuming you're in the states, it's fine to cash out Bitcoin through Coinbase that you made from Bitcoin trading. So obviously don't do it all at once, but you could claim it as trading profits over the period of several years. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 18:00:31
Haha, I used to do the same thing as you, but 1) the time involved, and 2) the high fees eventually pushed me towards better options. I use OKcoin.com for my trading.  You can buy and sell as much as you want per day, with minimal fees.
It's based in China, but Tim Draper helped fund it, so that might help with any legitimacy concerns you have. Anyway, I've used it for over a year and have no complaints--their 24/7 support staff are also topnotch from my experience.
If you end up going this route, I'd appreciate it if you used my referral link (
Best of luck!

Nope, fuck that noise. Just declare shit for taxes when it touches your bank account.

Ah, that is a problem. Lots of people just fake their verification information, but I'm not going to suggest you do that.  Other exchanges take American customers (I think), for instance Bitfinex.com

Day-trading Bitcoin is not inherently gambling.  Day-trading Bitcoin takes a lot of discipline, skill, and time, but it can (and has) been quite profitable.  That being said, most people do not commit enough time, develop the discipline, or acquire the skill to be good day traders, so their trading is in fact gambling, which then makes them bitter and angst against any talk of trading. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:42:41
I've made so much money just margin shorting Bitcoin for the past year... It's been glorious.

Totally depends upon how many free spins you have, though each spin generally gives you .1 LTC, or occasionally, 1 LTC.  Throughout my spinning, I've grossed about 70 LTC. 
I mean, nobody's getting rich off it, but it's something to do to keep me from overtrading, lol.
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:14:04
You can come margin trade it with me on Okcoin.com :)
Before I get slaughtered by all the r/bitcoiners in here, yes, margin trading can be risky, but that's why you start out with a very small amount, and treat it as a learning process.  Furthermore, there are at times very obvious moves (Coinbase pump, Lunar Pump, etc), and if you are near your keyboard during these announcements, x20 margin longing is basically free money (and more Bitcoin to hodl!)
But yes:  start very small, be disciplined, and enjoy the learning experience.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:51:52
"malicious traders could then calculate how much money is needed to drive the price to a level that will force margin calls on other users, and earn profit from those users who were forced liquidated."  
Lol, I'm pretty sure that actually happens on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:39:49
Thanks for doing this AMA, I am a big fan of your platform, and trade upon it daily.
1) That being said, while trading on OKC, the presence of HFT bots has become quite evident. What is your position on users implementing HFT bots on your exchange?
2) Others in the industry have enabled x50 margin trading--are you considering implmenting the same to ensure that your platform stays up-to-date with industry standards?
3) Just a suggestion, I think it would do you well to promote some of your more notable backers. Whether fair or not, Chinese exchanges often come with a stigma to western traders, and spreading awareness about some of your large supporters (for instance, Tim Draper) would go a long way towards increasing user confidence.
Overall I love the site--thank you for providing this platform, and I do hope that you continue to work in the community for years to come.

As an NA user, I actually won lots of "free" LTC on the spin wheel.  Granted it wasn't in English, but the LTC spends the same.
