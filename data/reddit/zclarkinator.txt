his use case is "use it to purchase things", I don't know wtf use case you have yourself but it's not the one most enthusiasts want
if you see bitcoin as an investment from which to profit from then you're part of the problem. ideally the gains (and loss) from such a currency would be extremely low and stable, as in any real currency
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:42:21
well if folks just dump money into it forever for absolutely no reason then sure, it can continue forever. but uh, people looking for an actual currency are going to look elsewhere. people dumped money into beanie babies for years for basically no reason, look how that turned out

I think that's like 50% or more of people invested in it currently
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:19
I mean I can buy a hammer for $5 at lowes and get your wallet password easily enough
everything can be taken from you. nothing is forever. nothing wrong with owning things, but don't act like they matter in the grand scheme of things
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:20:11
how about use a different coin that already has these features and skip the problem entirely
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:28:54
That's a better sub if you intend to trade things that have actual value
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:27:21
Bounce back to what? Do you really think 20k is the natural resting point? Who's to say it's not supposed to be at 5k?

worthless commodities have been used as currencies before, nothing new here
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:43:55
not all money in existence is ever loaned out at once you donut
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:29:44
make sure you hodl forever instead of putting actual thought into it
just like any inves- I mean currency

...or they decided this was a sound financial move and has nothing to do with what randos on reddit and twitter want 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:40:07
...but you won't have an infinite number of tokens so you will directly care
and if you did have an infinite number of tokens, their value will be exactly 0. not 0 dollars, absolute 0 value, 100% worthless in any exchange of anything

I mean it's about 90:10 so he's not really wrong
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:42:45
that's psychology, which isn't a factor given that you can't see who's buying what, or how much. It's one big soup of anonymous peoples, and some of them can even sell to themselves, muddying up the mix even more
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:43:02
...yes? where the money is kept at a given moment doesn't relate to who owns the money. by that logic anyone that has ECoins on an exchange doesn't own any coins at all
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:31:42
There are a finite number of beanie babies too, what's your point
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:08:09
what proof do you have that they weren't putting the gears in motion at the very start? I'm more wont to believe actual businessmen who do this for a living before anons on reddit

a stock goes up nearly $6000 in value in a year and you don't call that volatile
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:21:56
are you actually an idiot? _you get the interest money from wherever it is you earn money_, like a job or other investments or whatever. This extra value doesn't have a physical bill backing it up, but the bills are fucking superfluous so who gives a fuck. It really doesn't matter how much USD is represented by a bill, because we live in a world in which the internet was invented and you can hold money by proxy
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:39:45
it's a stock in all but name. the only difference is it's not tied to the performance of a physical company, which makes it even more volatile
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:25:36
you mean jp morgan deliberately tried to make the value of bitcoins fall (and succeeded) knowing they it will bubble even further so they can make money off of the idiot that think something can just gain infinite value magically and will never fall
I like how you say tulips have no use, but then don't explain what use digital nothings have, in fact I'd say tulips at least look pretty so they're arguably _more_ useful
just admit you're gambling, I'd respect you more for it
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:29:46
60% less than a month ago evidently
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:33:07
It's not up 600% for the gigantic majority. Most people claiming they got in way early are full of shit.
That you see bitcoin as a store of value instead of a currency makes you part of the problem. Nobody fucking uses gold to buy things, that's retarded
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:38:43
because this whole deal is a house of cards and he decided to get out at a time he felt was safe, which seeing as how things are going I can't blame him
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:29:46
if fiat currency crashes, bitcoin loses about 99% of its value because society would be in the middle of major collapse and nobody will give a fuck how many digital coins you have vs. getting food and supplies
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:37:22
they can make it useless to the gigantic majority of people though, which will tank its value instantly. it's easy; websites that operate in the US are not allowed to accept cryptocoin payments. Boom, it's effectively banned. You can still privately send them around, but nobody would want them (besides other criminals) because they can't spend them on anything
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:53:22
So how does this work as a currency then? Why would my mom be interested?
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:44:48
the money doesn't come out of "thin air". using money that isn't yours comes with a cost, called "interest". you don't just get free money, it has never worked that way (except maybe in the 1600s or something in Rome)
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:36:11
I can't help but sense some projection
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:50:27
you haven't actually made an argument so there's not much to admit to begin with
too bad you deleted your post, I was going to suggest coming back in a year and rereading that just so you get a look at how cringy you sound. seriously, you're mimicking every teenager I've known on this website almost exactly. you should work on that, bubby
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:35:49
watch out, you'll cut yourself on that edge
