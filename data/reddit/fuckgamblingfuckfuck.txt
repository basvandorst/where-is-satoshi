Twitter post said something about binance giving away free BTC if you send to that address. Like they would double it or something sending double back of what you sent. Idk didnt read it all just guessing.

I hope it doesn't go full parabolic again. Slow and steady sounds great to me.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:55:46
Yeah eventually at 100K+ (1M+ so McAfee doesn't need to eat his dick!?!) it will be a lot more stable.
I think we are gonna have a few more bubble/crash cycles before then though.

 [ So, That's the End of Bitcoin Then]( –  Forbes | $15.15 
" Bitcoins aren’t secure, as both the recent theft and this password problem show. They’re not liquid, nor a store of value, as the price collapse shows and if they’re none of those things then they’ll not be a great medium of exchange either as who would want to accept them? . . . It’s difficult to see what the currency has going for it. "

@_date: 2019-06-16 10:23:08
Right? Money is a human construct. Bitcoin is money with a wildly swinging purchasing power until it gets more stable with mass adoption (if it happens).
We have two options to cause the price to stop swinging:
1. Mass adoption and BTC moon.
2. People stop using it.
For some reason right now the masses keep wanting to use shitty infinitely inflating, devaluing fiat that takes DAYS to transfer between accounts.
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:10:14
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:52:44

Get a Trezor or Ledger, infinitely safer than encrypting your keys. They are like $70, not a waste considering if you encrypt on a USB, if the computer is infected with malware when you decrypt to transact you could lose thousands. $70 for piece of mind is worth it.

You should use a passphrase, then you are safe even if someone finds your 24 words. The passphrase is an additional word, making the seed 25 words but you don't write the passphrase down. There is an option to do this when you set up the wallet and documentation on Trezors website.

I just don't want to hodl everything through a crash again. I have a feeling there will be a pullback when it gets close to 19k since a lot of people will be thinking the same thing as you said. I think I'll just slowly scale out and use some stop loss ordera when it gets close to there.

I got downvoted for saying the following, blocking these morons, shouldn't have even bothered.
"It is a cryptocurrency. We could debate for hours on what a "real" currency is, but I don't want to get into that.
Many places accept BTC for payments now. Including AT&amp;T and Whole Foods."

Quick!! Buy some of that Ripple, it's so dang cheap. It's less than a dollar!!! It's gonna go up so much because it's so cheap like Bitcoin once was. --My father

The only way I can see this happening is if all countries make cryptocurrencies illegal, and even then they can't stop the network, just criminalize it. I don't see this happening considering big players like Fidelity beginning to offer cryptocurrencies.

Get a Ledger or Trezor, much safer. You don't have full control on an exchange. Not your private keys.
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:16:22
Something doesn't have to have a psysical representation to be real. Is this thread on reddit not real?
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:22:44
We will see the bull flag if the support hexagon doesn't go too far into the 29th fib line. When we see the ascending unicorn that is the signal to buy as the meteor shower is commencing.

Use Coinbase Pro or just Coinbase? Coinbase Pro has pretty low fees. Binance has even lower if you use a stablecoin instead of USD.

@_date: 2019-05-20 17:54:16
Please explain then, I want to understand your perspective, you are not the only person I have seen with this view. If BTC was only $2, the total USD value of circulating supply would only be $35.4 million. What if people want to move millions with BTC, what about billions? They won't be able to with a price that low.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:27:38
It seriously feels like market manipulation. Whenever this happens there is tether news.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:59:07

It's extremely frustriating.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:45:05
Yeah I know the feeling... I lost the private key to an ETH wallet with 0.1 on it :(
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:11:34
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:12:37
Safer than holding on some random exchange, but having sole ownership of your private keys is the absolute best way. If you have a lot, it is worth getting a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor.

It's a little better. Resistance and support lines work often but you can't rely on it 100%.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:41:24
Only buy what you can afford to lose.

@_date: 2019-05-20 08:13:22
If BTC was under $2 it wouldn't be any better than paypal... It is a lot more than just for online transactions, it is decentralized money. Gives power back to people and away from the banks. At under $2 it would have almost no market capitalization so people would just buy it and immediately spend it you are saying? Everyone should concur that the dollar is thr better currency? That's what XLM/stablecoins are for.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:38:52
