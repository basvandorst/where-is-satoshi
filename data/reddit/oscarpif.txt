Not really a counter-argument but couldn't you raise the same concerns with respect to mining? 
And if one government starts choking too much, I guess hubs will move to other jurisdictions. And if all governments start cooperating for the ultimate global scale choke, well ... that would be a first ;P

Every 2016 blocks, which translates to roughly every two weeks.

Is the coordinator “almost” gone?

How does transaction batching actually work? I guess you have one transaction with a whole bunch of inputs and outputs rather than a whole bunch of transactions with one(?) input and one output. But what exactly makes it more efficient to do batching?

The first lightning transaction has been conducted on the Bitcoin mainnet. That's not vague. When and how it will be usable on a large scale that's still vague yes. But again, lightning is an application layer on top of Bitcoin. Even without lightning, Bitcoin has unique features that make it valuable. IOTA is *IMO* not so interesting if it cannot get rid of the coordinator.

I've had issues. But indeed, Ethereum transactions are typically faster and cheaper than Bitcoin transactions. But IMO Ethereum nor any other cryptocurrency has solved the scaling issues as of today. For some currencies it's just less obvious that they are there.

I would say it's different. If IOTA cannot get rid of the central coordinator, it is nothing but a complicated version of an excel sheet managed by the IOTA foundation. Right now, IOTA is not working as intended. Don't get me wrong, I definitely would like to see IOTA being able to achieve it's goals in the future. 
Bitcoin, whether or not you agree with certain design choices being made, is working as intended. Lightning would be an application layer on top of the base Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:51
At least with Bitcoin you can get your transactions through by paying higher fees than others. In that sense it is working as intended. With Ethereum it is a complete mess right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:51:23
Does the change output really count towards the transaction size? I thought it is not actually part of the transaction data but that it is automatically calculated as the difference between inputs and outputs. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:26:20
Propose a BIP. But my guess is that the majority of devs prefer to implement techniques to compress transactions first.

A day or two after the lnd beta was released, there was this person who was "caught" trying to publish old states to the network, but, as it turns out, this person was not actually trying to steal anything. If I remember correctly, this person lost the file containing channel states, recovered the file from an outdated backup, closed channels based on these outdated channel states and then got punished.
If I understand correctly, with the eltoo mechanism, would simply allow the other party to present the latest state to the network in this case thief-whose-not-actually-trying-to-steal would not be punished. Doesn't sound so bad to me to have this option.

I've seen the same OTC activity but it might as well be scammers trying to sell non-existent tokens.

I have incredible amounts of respect for the Core devs. And I can imagine them being frustrated by all the NYA stuff. I think it would be better if everyone would stop with name calling and accusations on things like Twitter though.

"Nuff said"
No. Regardless of who the authors are, we should be discussing the proposed idea (and luckily that is happening as well). Even if the idea turns out to be not that useful that's still OK. Discussing it serves as education. And education is important. More important than all the conspiracy shit (coming from both sides).

It’s not necessairly the 2mb that is the problem I think, it’s the New York Agreement. The future of Bitcoin should not be decided by a few mining pools operators and other businesses. The “NO2X” really should be “NONYA”. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:45:28
No, this is not my “first experience with Core”. And I appreciate the work that is being done by Bitcoin Core developers to improve Bitcoin. No need to use my remark on part of a tweet from one developer to make a negative statement on a whole group of developers.

You are making this bigger than it should be. I’m aware of who Eric Lombrozo is and I have great respect for the work he is doing for Bitcoin. And it’s not like the “other side” is playing nice on Twitter. I just everyone would lay off the accusations and name calling ao that we can focus more on things that do matter.

A lot of the hate seems to come from "investors" who got into cryptocurrencies last December and who think that it is the Bitcoin developers who determine the withdrawal fees charged by exchanges.

@_date: 2017-09-15 12:28:17
Why worse? Back in 2013 after the crash Bitcoin (and Blockchain) was seen as a failed experiment. Nowadays there is an incredible amount of businesses seeing value in Blockchain technology. Even traditional media have stopped with the "Bitcoin is for criminals" only nonsense. I'm not saying there isn't going to be a bear market. But I beloeve the situation to be very different from 2013, different in a positive sense for Bitcoin.

I agree with you that Andreas' introduction video is an excellent start.
I would also highly recommend this video from "3blue1brown":  
The animations are beautiful and this dude also made a really cool video on how secure SHA2256 is. It may be a good idea to pause the video every now and then to make sure everyone understood and agrees with what was being said.

Let's say you have a Bitcoin wallet on your phone and convince Alice and Bob to both send you 1 Bitcoin. They do so and now there are two so called "unspent transaction outputs" (UTXO's) on the network that you can unlock with the help of your private keys. If decide to send 1 Bitcoin to Charlie, you only need to unlock one of them. If you decide to send 2 Bitcoin to Charlie, you need to unlock both UTXO's and the transaction will be larger in size.

I used to like Breadwallet. Would have been willing to pay/donate back then. But they decided to do an ICO a few months ago. I'm no longer willing to pay them for anything.
