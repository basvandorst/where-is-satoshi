That's SUPER long term though... Still upward only compared to last October... 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:55:37
So all in all you're up? That's good to hear. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:53:57
If you’re invested with both it’s kinda stressful

25, and I bought into bitcoin in November, but have been following since last summer. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:44:48
Betting on other crypto's success would be great.

Since it's only been around for a couple years I feel like monthly still makes more sense than yearly. I definitely see where you're coming from, but I can't shake that we are in the same place as we were 6 months ago. Sure, there was a bubble that I expected would pop... but I didn't see it popping all the way to here. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 04:35:23
My PayPal doesn't look like this... is this new? 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:30:51
I definitely hope this happens as well... but it seems to me like they are just driving it straight down to zero. What would make them fend off?
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:56:04
Keep asking! They are listening!
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:56:14
It just seems like their ceilings are getting lower and lower instead of higher and higher. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:31:54
I feel like your scenario is just as possible as the opposite one. Greedy sharks tanking the price with waves that will get lower and lower. That's why I'm scared. I want your scenario to win, though. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:36:03
Mine have been in cold storage since November, when I bought them. I definitely thought of them as an investment. I'm hoping in a year or so they will be stronger again, but if it tanks, it tanks. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:36:39
Very pretty. I signed up to be a beta tester but never got an email?
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:46:53
Did you buy a lot? You never sold? I'm in a similar situation and have lost quite a bit now. i'm pretty sad about it. but at this point it's like... welp it basically worth nothing now
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:48:32
hold on for deal life
@_date: 2019-11-19 05:05:52
Have you not been on one of Boston’s famous Duck Tours? Sir you should treat yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:16:05
Like paper storage. With a QR code?

@_date: 2017-11-03 22:24:53
But if I am not “in coinbase” by November 16th will I miss my chance? 
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:34:42
There’s a bitcoin office on wall st. Call them up!
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:35:24
The winklevoss twins actually look at their dms try them

You mean “90’s”???
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:38:07
Mmm yup. You’re right. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:16:23
My hope! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:55:49
What news is that?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:43:21
Mine are in a paper wallet but originally purchased on coinbase... what does this mean for me? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:55:59
Not gonna lie. I am sad.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:16:04
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:00:09
You are so helpful I really appreciate it. Hopefully when the software arrives another helpful person will post about it here and we will all be simply set! (Easier said than done with bitcoin though) 
Have a nice day!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:50:17
Ah that’s interesting. Your assumption is that someone will make a program to easily transfer a paper wallet to three separate accounts? Do you think coinbase will do this or will it be a new third party? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:51:46
Ah that’s interesting. Your assumption is that someone will make a program to easily transfer a paper wallet to three separate accounts? Do you think coinbase will do this or will it be a new third party? 
Furthermore... after I transfer them back “online” through this software would I presumably be able to put them right back into cold storage? Or even just withdraw them as cash?
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:10:46
I can't figure out how to buy monero
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:52:36
Yes. Numberer.
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:07:48
Well that was nice to listen to!

I am a professional voice over artist and accept Bitcoin as payment via my site EliteVoiceOver.com! 
No one has ever used it to pay me, in favor of PayPal... but I remain hopeful! 
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:47:51
Pound-er? Hash-er? Number-er? What are you saying.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:33:39
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:10:34
Seems legit
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:34:37
Thanks! So the major drops in price won't happen too many more times then?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:00:13
Oh man that hurt to read... so jealous
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:32:38
Thanks! These are great reasons. I'm mostly looking for things to keep my eye on... since is really all I know what to look through at this point. 
I feel like coinbase might cause some problems in the future, since they are really the only easy way for a noob to get in... and sometimes they don't make any sense.  
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:09:26
Well, if you can prove that you didn't authorize the transfer, and that it was a hack, then you should be able to get it back... no?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:11:49
I don't know when you last checked, but I just bought a bit a few minutes ago and that message was gone and said that I would get exactly the amount I purchased just now. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:56:30
I don't understand how you do this...?
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:28:19
I have an iPhone... but that thanks for your input! I do use coinbase... I might just have to bite the bullet and say SCREW a retirement fund! Ha
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:43:10
This makes a lot of sense, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:14:26
What makes you say that? I feel like it's not that many either, but here is my reasoning: 
If you bought some BTC at $1 I feel like it would be rare that you would invest $1500. That's a lot of money for something that basically no one has heard of at that point. Then if you got in when they were $50 you would have had to spend $75,000 to have that much now. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:30:34
I've got a Celica in Newton that I need to sell. Any chance you want to buy it with BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:39:08
I've already lost money.... I keep telling myself not to sell... just wait it out. I'm so sad right now. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:10:15
I know but like... over 1,000 people? Over 100,000 people?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:54:46
That describes my inner turmoil perfectly!  
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:14:17
How exactly does one do that?
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:45:14
Not to be bearish but I think that could be true sometimes. Who knows. Hopefully even those sharks will see the real value in holding bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:25:01
Can you please explain what Fiat is? Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:08:06
Yesterday I saw this sign up most of the day. For like, an hour or so, it wasn't there, which is when I bought. I was told that I would get exactly what I paid for at the price I paid for it. Hopefully that's true!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:15:18
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:10:44
I suppose that does make sense. It's scary, though. I think the paper wallet system is probably really the best idea then. Just... protect your own money and don't keep a lot online.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:38:07
Ohh so just wiping the phone would wipe your bitcoin. Yeesh! Again, I'm super sorry about that.

Oh man. Whoever found your phone really knew what they were doing. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:08:36
Woah woah woah... losing your smartphone means you can lose your bitcoins? How is this possible?
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:52:29
I know. Hearing that makes me feel better. I know in my brain that you're right. My heart still weeps. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:03:59
But... Why?
