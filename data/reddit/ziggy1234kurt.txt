Its mainoulate buddy. They pumped it again to 14k so they could get more shorts in before the final crash

Not necessarily, their aim is to make as much money as they can. The mega whales are also holders of bitcion. I believe they definilty dont want the price to go to 0. They will pump btc next CME contract.

This is absolutely not the reason, are you serious? Billions get taken out of the market to fund presents? How naive are you.
This occurred because CME futures closes tomorrow. And the whales want a low price to close the contracts out. 
In saying this i beileve their next move will be to pump btc as they are also mega holders of bitcoin and a 0$ bitcoin hurts them too.

Yeah i agree all scammers, id prefer them to regulate the mess of the alt coins and in doing so kill 95% of them
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:27:03
This, hopefully alt coins all die this year and btc goes mainstream
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:29:20
I agree with what you are saying entirely, but why do you think there will be no greater fool to continue buying, seems this market and world are full of an endless number of fools.

This is 100% accurate and I have lived in China for 6 months. Foreigners have no chance vs a Chinese in any situation in China.

You dont understand, btc dominance is an absolutely useless metric. You realise i can create any alt coin with 100mil supply and sell one coin for $1 and thats a 100mil loss of BTC market cap. Multiply this by new alts being created everyday and you have a loss of BTC dominance

Buy VEN give moneys too Chinese overlord
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:54:12
Yes unbelievable the amount of uninformed idiots that come out at this current time.
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:52:43
Yeh go over to r/cryptocurrency and watch the noobs argue over how shit bitcoin is and how superior eth is. Alot are even saying they hope btc goes to 0 as long as we get rid of it from the market-doesnt matter if it takes everything down temporary. 
Probably just noobs that bought in Dec and watched btc destroy all their profit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:54:37
Pretty certain this will happen. B/w 10-12k until eth tops out too high in terms of satoshis, then btc will go on a run

Even people in regular crypto are too stupid for bitcoin, yesterday in the NEO thread I argued with someone who doesnt care whether a coin is centralised or not as long as it is fast. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:25:15
What happend to r/cryptocurrency I stopped going on it because it was an absolute shillfest. Now its changed to every noob hating on btc. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:34:21
How is that promoting, i was saying they are idiots and i dont own any NEO, maybe you are stupid as well. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:32:25
I wouldnt get so arrogant, it can still definitely happen even thought i hope it doesnt. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:05:58
Who will accept a centralised coin if they smash bitcoin into the ground, they are better off pumping it and getting everyone to love BTC before introducing their own. Which probably wont be a competitor anyway. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:30:07
Do not do this, sell alts at the bottom could be the stupidest thing you could do. Although I agree your ratio of btc to alts is terrible, nows not the time to fix it. Wait to alts pump first then reallocate
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:27:53
Anyone know where all the 8000 BTC wallets that sprung up in the last 2 weeks came from?
