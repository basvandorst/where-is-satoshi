I think it's way, way past that sentimentality. Thanks to the Internet we now have practically instantaneous, uncensored, unfettered mass communication. And with the ubiquity of camera-phones we now have instantaneous, almost-uncensored and unfettered (they try to block it, hard) evidence gathering.
The "few bad apples" mantra doesn't cut it anymore. With academies regularly pumping out indoctrinated, militarized, fraternal, thin-blue-line, Us Vs. Them-cultured "sheepdogs" (yes, that's what they call themselves) [after a mere 20 weeks]( with *barely* 36 to 100 hours of training in actual law, there's little room for good apples. The evidence is overwhelming, good apples are turned rotten or tossed out of the barrel.
I know this will get down-voted to oblivion because people still insist on putting law enforcement on an undeserved and unearned pedestal of trust and admiration, like our good parents taught us to do, but now more than ever we need to scrutinize first, laud later.
Until proven otherwise, they're all bad apples.

Contrast that with the Federal Reserve's estimate of [How much U.S. currency is in circulation?]( 


So, if the value of one Satoshi rose to equal 1 Cent, then a Bitcoin would equal $100,000,000 dollars and the total max value of the Bitcoin universe would equal 2.1e+15 or 21,000,000,000,000,000 or 21 Quadrillion US dollars.

I wish I still had it, but I used to have an old DOS "Banner" program that would take a line of text and print it out sideways on fan-fold paper, each letter as tall as the page width, made entirely out of that individual letter printed over and over.

No. It was spam.
I mean, there *may* have been an underlying idea at some ISP that it might positively affect their e-mail subscriber numbers, but in those days they weren't making money off of e-mail clients. E-mail service, like FTP and a basic webspace, were an add-on incentive to attract users to their ISP business. It later became so ubiquitous that no ISP would even consider NOT supplying e-mail service.
But it was not at all unusual for a user to already have e-mail through any number of other e-mail providers (most often their University). Or even run their own e-mail server.
The blocking came about from the spam wars of the 90's, with the likes of [Sanford "Spamford" Wallace]( who would open thousands of accounts daily on thousands of e-mail providers and then blast millions of spam out per day until the accounts were shutdown then move on. They would also take over existing mail servers (often hosted by home users) and hijack e-mail clients and use them to send spam.
To combat spam the ISP's found it expedient to take the lazy route and just block outbound, off-network port 25 SMTP traffic not destined to their own mail servers. This caused a HUGE explosion of outrage among Netizens, who found their business and university accounts now blocked, and Net Neutralists who were of the "DON'T FUCK WITH MY DATA" persuasion. Many ISP's were forced to back off and unblock port 25 for those who demanded it.
When ISP's burble about "reasonable network management" data blocking, they're talking about shit like Port 25 as their justification.

Yes and no. 
If you are communicating to a host who is also on Starlink's network then your packets will go straight up from your pizza-box transceiver, get routed satellite-to-satellite (@ speed of light in a vacuum) to a satellite over the host and then beamed down to the host's transceiver. Same in reverse. Your packets never leave Starlink's network and enjoy faster long-distance transit times and (typically) fewer hops than terrestrial packets.
If you're communicating to any other terrestrial Internet host, your packets will go up, get routed satellite-to-satellite (@ speed of light in a vacuum) to the geographical region of the host and then beamed down to a nearby Internet peering exchange. There it will continue on the remaining distance same as any other terrestrial packet.
As far as the Internet is concerned, it's all the same. *There is no geography in cyberspace.* All that matters is "speed of light in a material" + digital routing overhead.
