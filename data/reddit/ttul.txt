Absolutely, but as a public service, I could see some of the larger pools doing this if nuisance data in the block chain starts to become an issue that reduces the potential value of Bitcoin. They miners have a huge vested interest in keeping the blockchain clean and useful, and so I predict some scrubbing of garbage transactions will start happening if it hasn't already.

I'm having a hard time understanding why Mark isn't being more open about what things they are trying in order to resolve their problems. Sometimes shit happens. If your intention is to be around for the long term, you maintain communication and tell people how hard you're working. Just think about BP's response to the gulf oil spill. It was clear they fucked up, but they at least gave the media front row seats, allowing them to see all the things BP was doing to clean up the mess.

I would guess by codifying regulations that specifically delineate what a crypto currency is, and which players in the market need to report about transfers. Chances are there will be a legal requirement to report Bitcoin transfers over $10k in value - even if this is unenforceable with technology. So, not just transfers to and from fiat, but also BTC to BTC.
Yes, good luck with that.

I think there's a good chance that Intel is looking at adding some Bitcoin mining capabilities to some of their mass market processors. Probably not standalone chips because the market is too small, but if they added mining to all chips (or substantially all), then this would provide a very interesting new revenue stream via some Intel mining pool service.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:11:21
Thinking about this a bit more... Intel is basically a chip manufacturer. Everything else they do is in support of maintaining and extending their dominance of the general purpose processor market. When Intel sees someone making silicon for a specific purpose that might help them sell their general purpose processors, they get interested and either build that capability themselves, invest in the company, or buy the company. "Intel Ventures" is basically a way of supporting ecosystem partners that help Intel sell more processors. This is why they've invested so heavily into Cloud computing companies - the "cloud" is basically a big distribution channel for processors.
So the question is: how does blockchain technology help Intel sell general purpose processors? If they add mining computation hardware to their chips, then Intel can essentially make everyone a part of the Bitcoin world. Add a bit of special purpose hardware to help make the mining less susceptible to botnet takeover, such as enabling customers to register their hardware with the Intel mining pool, and locking the mining contributions with hardware encryption tied to the chip. Boom - Bitcoin mining moves to the masses, with each participant being paid a tiny sum for contributing a bit of power to the process.
If Intel believes that blockchain technology is going mainstream, making sure they are at the center of the blockchain world via mining hardware on every chip would ensure that AMD and ARM are less well suited to solve the problems that people want to solve using their general purpose processors.

Consider this: If Bloomberg news dropped a story tomorrow morning that Saudi Arabia had to shut off 10 million barrels a day of oil production three months from now on a given Thursday, do you think traders would wait until three months from now to start demanding higher prices for oil? Or, would the price immediately trade higher?
Answer: The smart trader holding oil buys more of it, because he knows if he can hold it in a storage facility until three months from now, the supply/demand ratio will drop, raising the price at which the oil can be sold. Lots of traders do this (within minutes of the news breaking), and the price increases quickly to the point where it's high enough that adequate oil storage will be brought on line to deal with the forthcoming shortage.
Now let's consider the Bitcoin world. Everyone has known for a very long time that the mining reward is going to be cut in half. Anybody who's invested a material amount into a mining operation has modeled this fact for ages, and has already priced in the cut in the mining reward to ensure their operation will continue to be profitable after the cut takes place. Equivalently, buyers of Bitcoin have factored in the forthcoming drop in production, and in anticipating scarcity, have bought up more coins than they likely will on a daily basis after the mining reward is cut. Just like the oil example, buyers are stockpiling coins now, in anticipation of a shortage in future.
Therefore... I wouldn't expect the price of Bitcoin to change much as the reward is cut in half. What will probably change - gradually, albeit, because people are slow to adapt the scale of their mining operations - is that miners will be forced to become more energy efficient, and that many miners who are using GPU based operations will find themselves running unprofitably and will therefore give up and exit the market, leaving more hashing strength for those who invested in efficiency.
Extend the story further, and Vlad's strategy starts to make a great deal of sense. ASICs mine about 7x more efficiently than FPGAs. So while many miners blow thousands on FPGAs, Vlad is busy working on an ASIC, which - when the mining reward is cut in half - will give him such a massive advantage that he may well end up controlling close to half of the network (he'll never try to control more than that, because it will cook his investment).

Wire transfer is not the only way to move money across borders. An example would be xe.com. Using their service, I can get money from Canada to Spain for 0.4% of the transferred amount - and that's all the fees I pay.
If you consider the cost of moving USD into Bitcoin and then back out into the receiver's local currency, traditional money transfer services can be cheaper. In my analysis I found Bitcoin cost about 1.1% vs the 0.4% quoted above.
However there are some huge advantages to Bitcoin. First, transfers are instant. Second, nobody can stop you. Third, sender and recipient can remain anonymous. Even if you're not using Bitcoin to buy drugs, these advantages are pretty cool. There are many times each month that I wish I could pay international suppliers with BTC... It would save me many hours.

Getting set up takes a few tedious steps because they have to know your identity (yes, Bitcoin wins here); however, once you have set things up, transferring money to and from registered accounts is very easy. EFT-based transfers (using SIPA or the Canadian Payments Network for example) don't incur transfer fees. You only pay the spread on the currency conversion, and the spread is going to be way way smaller than at your bank.

Not long... You'd be surprised how profitable bitcoin mining is (still). I ran a model and worked out an annual return on capital of about 150%.
Here's why it's profitable:
1. People are actually using the currency for real transactions - $10K/hour worth! Holy shit: 
2. Setting up a bitcoin mining operation is a pretty technical task. Most people would never do it, so miners are getting rewarded not just for their capital investment, but also their "skill".
3. You have to be a little bit smart to not blow your brains out on hardware investment. The best people can set up a "rig" capable of mining 1.2GHash/s for $2,000. That just blows me away, considering the GPU cost for that rig would be at least $1500 at today's prices.
So.. it's a question of supply of smart people vs. demand for currency. And the currency demand just keeps growing. I think 2011 will be a breakout year for Bitcoin. Just waiting for the WSJ coverage to make it really explode (just wait until the hedge funds get involved in this).
@_date: 2011-03-25 03:31:46
Yes, this is accurate. The difficulty level is increased as the power of the network increases. It's all tuned to keep the average rate of bitcoin generation at 6 blocks per hour, 24x7x365.
So if you suddenly have massive amounts of computing power, the limit of your advantage in the market will be to benefit from the transaction fees and value of new bitcoins generated. But you'll never exceed 6 blocks per hour, and their current value is 300 bitcoins (50BTC per block).

I found a posting here about Via SHA-256 performance: 
That was back in 2006 and the numbers are for the Via C7 processor. The C7 web site claims 5Gbps of SHA-1 or SHA-256 (see  Each Bitcoin nonce iteration requires 2048 bits of SHA-256 operations, so we can estimate 5Gbps / 2kb = 2 million per second, or 2 MHash/s.

I have heard that the 6990 may not be as good as the 5970 because it has a smaller number of stream processors. But time will tell. Someone needs to actually get one of these things, run it, and then report on the performance.
The problem with the GPUs is that they aren't designed for high integer performance, but rather target floating point. SHA-256 hashing is all about integer performance. This is why there is such a huge discrepancy between Nvidia and Radeon - the Nvidia cards have shit integer performance even though their performance for graphics operations is very closely on par with ATI.

I disagree - mining profitably requires some level of skill, and that skill is rewarded with profit. There's nothing crazy about this.
You wanna make money mining? Invest a few million on a custom mining ASIC that beats the pants off of GPUs (from a performance-to-power-consumed perspective), and then sell the silicon to miners. The best computation to power performance will always win. GPUs are very very powerful, but eat up about 2MHash/s/Watt (in the best case). A custom ASIC could provide 10-fold increase in power efficiency.

Transaction fees. Every time a transaction is broadcast to the network, it includes a "tip" for whichever miner is lucky enough to create the block containing that transaction.

If they are truly using 28nm, then they will completely obliterate the competition. But I seriously question whether they are doing 28nm. The up-front costs of spinning at that geometry are in the millions of dollars. I just don't see how they are doing this on an apparently shoe-string budget, as their web site evidences.
What they might be engaging in is a confidence scheme, whereby they create a partnership with a closely related ASIC shop, collect (illegally, in my opinion) advance payments for devices that don't yet exist, and then use that capital to fund the development process.
Guys, when you take pre-payments toward R&amp;D, it's called raising equity, and that falls under the purview of securities regulators -- big nasty types who will put you in jail unless you follow the rules.

This is a really great idea. Keeping your Bitcoins in a hardware wallet is really the only way to ensure that they don't get hijacked. PCs are too insecure, because no matter how well you write your wallet software, the rest of the environment can be hijacked, for example to put a shim between your keyboard and the password entry in your software wallet.
I imagine another kind of hardware wallet that has a small UI on it allowing you to send transactions. There would be a UI on your PC that would request the wallet send some BTC to a particular address. The USB stick or whatever would show you the details of the requested transaction, and you'd have to accept it by pushing a button. At that point, the transaction would be generated by the device, so the private key never leaves the hardware.

Why not contract out manufacturing - you know, like almost every self respecting electronics company in the world. Nobody buys their own pick and place machine. Why do this? Can anyone explain the rationale?

I'm still weirded out by BFL. Their cavalier approach to deposit money and their extreme delays. The spotted criminal history of their founder. The murky corporate structure.. Who actually owns that thing? Where is their funding from? Deposits? Angels?

That might be a good solution. Where can I buy a block erupter?

That all but confirms the theory. redandwhite is probably working for the NSA.

True. ASIC to FPGA means using a structured ASIC like Altera HardCopy or eASIC. The geometry of the structured part might be 28nm, but you lose a lot of power and space efficiency by not being able to customize the transistor layout.

Unless they are regulated by securities regulators, use extreme caution. Cavirtex had been clean so far, but that doesn't mean squat about the behaviour of their fund, and if nobody is forcing them to be honest...

If they are using eASIC, they will likely succeed; although they are looking at $1M NRE to get production parts made.

Sounds like a clear violation of the FTC rules. But, complaining is unlikely to help.

"A person that creates units of this convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods and services is a user of the convertible virtual currency **and not subject to regulation as a money transmitter**."
In other words, pay me $$$ and I'll send you a bunch of mining ASICs. Use those to generate your Bitcoins, and you and I are officially freed from the grips of FinCEN.
I wonder how FinCEN would view someone who provides a service that rents mining capacity to those who wish to obtain Bitcoins? Is that person exchanging dollars for Bitcoins, or dollars for computing power?

Federated exchanges is the only way to go, IMHO. Open source exchange software, spread like wildfire to a thousand different exchange operators, who link up with each other and share trade data to create a global order book. Each exchange provider can offer their own boutique approach that satisfies the needs of a niche of customers, without losing the scale required to offer good prices.
Anyone working on something like this yet?

... And I am pretty sure the securities laws here prohibit what they do/did, with harsh penalties. You can't start offering investments for sale without an investment dealer license; and then you also must sell only securities which are properly listed and monitored by the government.
I laud their creativity, but you have to understand we see a lot of investment scams here in Canada, and Havelock looks like one.

Well, if TSMC is involved, that would cut the time for spinning wafers. Mere mortals have to wait. Those with $200M and an equity stake, well..

I love Mozilla, but they're not in need of donations.

Yes, totally false: 
@_date: 2013-08-05 03:53:40
I don't see why not. The NRE on 22nm will be &gt;$10M; once you're in that range might as well just sink $200M in and win the race for all time. With this kind of cash, Avalon will absolutely dominate. Perhaps more importantly though, TSMC as a partner will block anyone else from doing the same with their 20nm tech. Joy.

In short: Tor was not compromised in order to find Ulbricht. He revealed himself by making some key mistakes, and from there it was a matter of plain old police work.

Hear hear - while trading provides liquidity and improves pricing for everyone, what's really missing is the global infrastructure to make Bitcoin accessible for everyone, in a wide variety of scenarios. We need more startups building more tools and integrations so that accepting Bitcoin is as easy as sending money via PayPal.
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:48:02
Roger that. Someone is going to seize the opportunity before long, and will be carefully reviewing this legal case to ensure the same mistakes aren't made. It's an arms race, after all...
