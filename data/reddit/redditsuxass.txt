Enforcing property rights requires violence, too, unless you consider state-initiated violence to be something other than violence. (Many people make the distinction of "violence" when ordinary people do it, versus "force" when the state does it.)

Evicting debtors and tenants from their homes requires *aggression,* not merely defensive violence, and yet is an expression of the banks'  and landlords' property rights. The only thing that stops debtors and tenants from using defensive violence is the overwhelmingly massive amount of violence that only a state can unleash, and the fear generated by the prospect of such an extreme level of aggression.

The "aggression" part is when the police come, sometimes armed with battering rams, SMGs, and other military weaponry, to do the aggressive work of eviction. There is nothing defensive about an eviction, unless you ludicrously equate the tenants' failure to vacate with initiation of violence.

Computers aren't limited to holding numbers that fit in their hardware registers. Numbers that *don't* fit in the registers, called arbitrary-precision numbers, or *bignums*, have existed since the 1960s.
Bitcoin is limited to 8 decimal places only because the designers of the software picked that limit.
