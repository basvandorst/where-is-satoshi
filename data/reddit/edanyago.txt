Hi All,
Thanks for your concern.
The fact that the coins have not moved, is unfortunate, but not a scam. The money was raised during the last days of the Maidan crisis in Ukraine. This was followed swiftly by the Crimea crisis. As a result, the original purpose for which we raised the funds had ended before we were able to get the funds out.
Therefore, we have been unable to disburse the funds to the originally intended recipients. We have been in touch with many groups operating inside Ukraine, seeking an good alternative. This has proven difficult, as there is a lot of confusion on the ground and finding someone we can trust is not trivial.
The funds will not be moved until an appropriate recipient is found. We are in touch with several groups operating to provide free and transparent media in Ukraine and they are the most likely candidates to receive funds. In any event, once funds are moved, we will provide what proof we can of the recipients and how the monies are being used.
We apologize that this has not been a smoother process.
Best, 
Edan Yago

I understand. I too like dash cams.

It was a test address. We have fixed it. Will transfer the coins transferred there to the main address. 
We did this all really fast. And are less perfect than Satoshi. We are merely human :)

Tel Aviv has the most intense Bitcoin scene in the world. Even regular meetups dwarf some of the Bitcoin confernces I have been to. 
The most advanced improvements - colored coins,  Zerocash (zerocoin), Ghost protocol, Mastercoin, multisig arbitration - all being developed in Israel. 
Really looking forward to the Tel Aviv Inside Bitcoins conference in July.

I love this community. Indeed, trust as little as possible. I hope we can maintain this kind of healthy skepticism more than two weeks out from a Goxxing. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:05:39
Not only can I confirm the above - I can also confirm that Tel Aviv is an amazing hotbed of Bitcoin innovation.
Lets raise thousands of coins!

I suck at Reddit titles. Suggestions?

A key problem that is currently being experienced by Civil Society groups is an in ability to obtain access to funds. In particular, they are unable to purchase much needed goods in Europe, as funds are trapped in the Ukraine. Bitcoin has already been bridging that gap. 
We are working with the Human Rights Foundation and its sister organizations to make sure that the funds are disbursed only for humanitarian and civil society causes. All funds will go to individuals or groups identified by these organizations to be performing a role in either:
* Providing humanitarian aid
* Providing civil rights support
* Journalists or others providing information to the world about what is going on in Ukraine
Funds will only be distributed to be used directly support of the above.
No funds will be provided to political groups, combatants or for the purpose or purchasing arms or armaments.
We look forward to additional suggestions from the community as to how best distribute funds, so long as it is in line with the above.
Funds will be distributed ASAP, starting from Saturday next week - and in any event no more than 10 days after the close of the funding campaign.

How thinly sliced can the timestamp be? In other words what temporal resolution could you get? Minutes? Seconds? Milliseconds?
Does the fact that blocks are generated at variable intervals have any impact?
More generally, what time is the timestamp tied to? The time on the clock from the node sending the transaction? The time on a receiving node? What if there are discrepancies?  
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:12:03
Yes. Time Zones, flights and Saturday have made this more difficult - but this will happen over the next few hours.

This whole humanity thing is a major bubble. Bound to come to an end sometime.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:36:44
Thanks Jason.  Means a lot coming from you. 
What made this feel important to me, is the opportunity to highlight the best aspects of Bitcoin - at a time when others are telling us "told you so".

On behalf of the social sciences, I would like to congratulate the professor!
Previously, serious questions were raised about his competence as a academic, when he made factually verifiable claims. This seriously undermined confidence in his ability to develop theories that were properly divorced from reality (or as we say in academia: "reality").
We are glad his theories are now sufficiently vague and abstract as to be beyond criticism that would make us question what we have been doing with our lives. 
Expensive faculty.

This is an embarrassing interview. The interviewers knew nothing about the subject matter. They know nothing about how the government works and made some pretty elementary mistakes. Perianne responded with a great deal of patience and civility - a kindness the interviewers were too juvenile to show her. 
We as a community need people like Perianne, who is doing a great job of advocating to powerful people who couldn't care a whit about technology.

On-chain transactions are the most secure. Of the various off-chain solutions, none are yet mature enough for primetime. They don't yet have good, extensive ecosystems and tend to create new frictions and barriers in transferring value. Of key benefit of using a decentralized system is the fact that everyone can be on the same standard. Current off-chain solutions break that standardization. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 19:30:37
The block-size debate is a huge problem, and symptomatic of an even deeper governance problem for this decentralized consensus system. It is, therefore, HIGHLY unfortunate that several members of this community have the same approach to free speech and controversial discussion as a Yale freshman student. .

CEO of the company here - we are indeed using the Bitcoin blockchain. What else would you use? 
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:14:58
Weird. We posted an update after transferring the fund to a Ukrainian  charity. But I can't find it.

I think, digitalh3rmit, that there may be something of a power imbalance between your power of boycott and that of global regulators.

Thanks. We will try to repo - but seems to be working for us.

That's me. I'm glad to say we are well on track - so I expect we will be making an announcement in November, as promised. Best way to stay updated ATM is through my twitter:

This type of activity is both inevitable and perilous. It can destroy the fungibility of bitcoin (bitcoin neutrality) and has menacing implications for privacy - especially in the hands of oppressive regimes. 
It is an issue I have brought up with many others, including members of DATA. A prime concern is that regulators will seek to disallow companies, such as exchanges, to accept coins that have not been "greenlit". 
The worrying truth is, I don't think we have yet a good idea how to combat this.
I encourage you all to offer up your suggestions. If you prefer privacy, but have some thoughts, please PM me.  
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:26:31
Tumblers will become easy marks - any coin that has been through them can be considered "suspect".
@_date: 2013-06-21 00:03:45
That's an insightful question. Several and we are performing substantial due diligence. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:35:51
Link is to (badly) Google translated version. Better translation of some other key quotes from the report:
"Bitcoin is primarily used by tax evaders, money launderers and individuals for whom privacy is considered sacred."
"The official financial authorities of the world are concerned about the phenomenon as it hides substantial money movement from their eyes."
I think this speaks to how financial authorities are currently thinking about Bitcoin: "Its probably just a bubble, so no need to deal with it - and if not, we will just crush it." 
This comes after Israeli Banks recently shut down Israel's main Bitcoin exchange. Israel may be a test case for how US authorities handle Bitcoin. The two countries have close ties, and Bitcoin adoption in Israel is greater than in the US. Countries often let one or another go first, to test the waters.

This is great! I wonder if there are other such precedents in common law.

Yes, we are working on creating a secure community website. We will be sending out invitations, initially via twitter.

If only it were that simple. The fact that a coin can only be spent in some places immediately reduces its value vs. one that can be spent anywhere. So suddenly Yifu's virgin coins become more valuable than those mined by some mom &amp; pop operation which is not registered. 
This will create the exact opposite incentive - not to defect but to join.
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:31:13
Thanks. I think that is a good idea and will put together something like that.
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:12:54
Thanks you sir. I am always nervous, when I put something out for public consumption, that the true depth of my stupidity will be revealed. I take solace in comments like your and single malt scotch.
