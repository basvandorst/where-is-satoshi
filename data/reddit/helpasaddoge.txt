Especially Litecoin. Litecoin more so than Bitcoin.
Why? Simple;
Historically, Litecoin goes up more (percentage wise) when Bitcoin moons. Plus the fact that Litecoin's lower price makes it more accessible to others (yes, yes I know they can get a tiny percentage of a Bitcoin, but most people don't know or want that), so more new players will enter the market.

Oh ok. I just wanted to know if bitcoiners care if a webshop writes its own reviews, or if they are a certified dealer, or if none of that matters as long as btc is accepted and products are delivered. Because I think the btc-exclusive shops are mainly dropshipping, I thought they were holding their own stock :P.

Thank you for your reply, but I don't appreciate your message. I ask a simple question and I get the complete opposite of my question. Did I ask what the safest way is to store my bitcoins? No. I have bitcoin in cold storage and want to try out a new bitcoin service. I am asking if that service is safe and trustworthy to use. If someone could give an informative reply, I would be thankful.

This is how I solved the problem:
- 1: New software update
- 2: Disconnected from the Wi-Fi connection at the office and used my own internet connection
- 3: Removed the BTC-e code, and downloaded it again (I have backups of the QR code and the written key with me and stored at a few secured places)
- 4: Go to my iPhone settings and reset date &amp; time and switch to ''automatic''.
And it worked again :D.
It's like a ''refresh''.
I don't know why I couldn't login though, my old iphone settings worked perfectly fine until today!

I don't understand why people still take a huge risk. China banned deposits and withdrawals, but an exchange decides to go against the rules of a totalitarian government (regime?), and people are buying into it. Their solution with funding through their own bank account and I believe gift cards will only work for a while. It's too soon to say when it will collapse as it is obviously a huge infrastructure to keep in place, and the government can close their business at any time as they are doing something against the law (yes, I know it is technically not against the rules they implemented, but every sane person knows that it's just an excuse, if it is up to any court/government, they will rule it as illegal).

Japan didn't impose bans/restrictions on bitcoin trading. MtGox's failure had something to do with the management. Besides, MtGox is history. These Chinese exchanges still exist, and people can still **prevent** to make the mistake to trust them. These Chinese exchanges are operating in very dangerous waters, their government basically banned the trading of bitcoins, they are only operating because they found some ways around it. How long do you think they will last? Before you know it, a new shit storm of negative news comes from China, stating that the government shut down all the Chinese exchanges. And if people put a lot of trust in these fake-volume exchanges, it will have a negative impact on bitcoin. But if people just keep away from these fake exchanges, and don't act on the non-news they publish (like Huobi's ''Litecoin trading''), negative news from China won't have a negative impact on bitcoin in the future.
So just stay away from these exchanges. Everything points to a future scam.
0% fees? Really? 
How stupid are you to fall from something like that. They want you to deposit your coins, and once they have tens of thousands of coins, they will suddenly shut down ''because the government restrictions which were announced in February just came into effect.'' I am sure they will make up some bull shit excuse. Just like the other exchanges that ran away with our money /bitcoins!

Actually it does. Bitcoin acceptance is something people need to focus on. But I wonder where the bitcoin shops get their supplies, I think they're just dropshipping products, but it's not a bad thing to ask questions right?

I read this on Havelock:
''Investor Protection Plan
The initial 5,042,638 shares of LMB Holdings have the privilege of getting all profits until a total of 0.0035 Bitcoin per share has been paid. Following this initial period of protection, dividends will be divided equally amongst all public and private shareholders.''
If I purchase shares today, am I still eligible for this protection, or have they already sold those initial shares?

Well, I don't keep a record of who said exactly what, but the general opinion on was that China doesn't matter anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:15:15
But is it like, logically related? Or is it just emotions/fake news being spread which causes that people panic buy, even though the news isn't really that important (anymore)? 
I mean, 2 Chinese exchanges decided to add LTC after the Chinese bans, this doesn't really make sense to me, it looks like they are just trying to pump the price, just to dump their Litecoins later on. 
I understand if bitcoin rises as it is widely known and has real value and exchanges etc. which operate bitcoin, and thousands of merchants that accept bitcoin, but I just don't see why Litecoin/BTC value increases, I hope someone can give a logical explain if that is possible.
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:21:48
Yes, but Huobi has also been accused of faking volume, so how much is that really worth?

Are you blind, or stupid, or both? Read: WHEN IT COMES TO BITCOIN. 
Do you think a country matters on all fields just because they are large or  have the 2nd largest GDP? India will soon have a larger population than China, but it doesn't look like India is affecting bitcoin, or does it?!
Again, read: China banned bitcoins. It doesn't matter how big they are in economy or population. The government is what matters. The government banned it. It's not like 1.3 billion Chinese are trading bitcoins and litecoins. Probably just a very select few with a lot of money and enjoy gambling (and Chinese are known for loving to gamble).
So please don't lecture me with bull shit like ''they are important because there are a lot of them hurr durr.''

That they haven't scammed/stolen yet doesn't mean that they won't in the future. This just smells like preparation for one of the biggest bitcoin scams. People are depositing coins there because of their zero fee. In combination with accusations of faking volume, I expect that we will see another ''disaster'' soon. This is just so suspicious, I can't even believe people try to justify it. 
0% FEES. ZERO. FAKED VOLUME IN THE PAST. THEIR HOST COUNTRY BANNED FIAT DEPOSITS TO THEIR EXCHANGE, AND WITHDRAWALS FROM THEIR EXCHANGE.

It's not about that. If the Chinese exchanges keep playing with Bitcoin for their own gains, it will only benefit them and those who make the right choices (gamble). But it will harm Bitcoin. If they continue with their game, we'll continue to see negative newsheadlines about Bitcoin. Serious investors and people who believe in Bitcoin will be scared away and sell their Bitcoins. Other people won't touch it because of its volatility. 
Everyone on seems to think that Bitcoin is only about making a profit. I don't even understand why this subreddit isn't called because very few people here seem to actually care about Bitcoin integration.

Thank you for your reply, but the last few sentences confused me (again... :P ).


Ok, so if I purchase shares on Havelock, I will receive the .0035 BTC per share ''dividend'', right? And do you know how this dividend will be paid out? (Automatically via Havelock?).

No, it is not old news. It was posted today on the Australian and less than 24 hours ago on WSJ. So shut your mouth about this being ''old news''. If it was old news, it wouldn't show up as most recent news in Google. Desperate fool.

Wow, 400 bitcoins!
That was worth almost 500,000 USD at its spike... And if bitcoin become really popular and successful (adoption), it could be worth even millions.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:27:47
Yes, this is what I mean.
LTC is more and more becoming a pump and dump coin. 
I mean, it went from $13 to $50 in a matter of hours, and it's actually still declining, but this China news is making litecoin go up - and always almost immediately go down. Literally seconds before BTC China announced that LTC is added, a huge buy order was placed on BTC-e. How is this not insider trading? I do not believe in ''luck'' when someone makes such a decision in a declining LTC market, and suddenly makes tens of thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes (LTC went to 21, and dropped back to 15-ish less than 12 hours later).
I find it a little bit discouraging. It looks like bitcoin is kinda stabilizing (which is good, stabilization is a good basis for steady growth), but other coins are really dangerous and misleading !

Why do people still report on Chinese exchanges?
I believe when China took measures AGAINST Bitcoin, everyone on this subreddit was shouting that ''China doesn't even matter, Chinese blocking has already been priced in.'' 
But now that those same Chinese exchanges show recovery, China suddenly matters again? That is very hypocrite and if shouting that bitcoin is going to crash = FUD, than acting like this is also FUD. 
Huobi &amp; other Chinese exchanges are known for faking volume, I think people should avoid using Chinese exchanges as measure for bitcoin price, they don't matter anymore, Bitcoin's volatility is caused by those exchanges. Chinese are known for loving to gamble, and they will continue to do so. As long as the Chinese have a huge role in bitcoin, price will never stabilize, those people are gamblers and only in it to make money. They don't want bitcoin to be adapted worldwide or people to start accepting bitcoin, like people in the West.
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:51:16
If bitcoin goes to Wall Street, bitcoin will lose its value as a currency and face the same issues as the USD and other fiat currencies. Like you said, they will create bitcoins out of thin air, they will be selling and buying non-existing bitcoins. Sounds the exact same like governments printing money which isn't backed by anything! 
There should be some price control, but I believe it should be an external organization voted for by the community, not by a government or Wall Street, we all know where that leads to!
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:00:27
Why are you even posting on this forum? The amount of Chinese who are suddenly active on English language forums is too damn high. I bet you're all desperate because your governments anti-bitcoin position. Your exchanges are all faking trading volume and you're trying to screw us over with your non-news!!!
Just leave us alone please. China has a very negative influence on bitcoin. Chinese are a bunch of gamblers, most of them don't care about bitcoin, they only care about pumping &amp; dumping coins.

*Litecoin has the same 1MB maximum block size limit as Bitcoin has. The big difference is that Litecoin generates 4 Blocks every 10 minutes while Bitcoin produces just one. So in theory Litecoin could handle 4 times more transactions as Bitcoin in its current implementation.*
*Bitcoin currently allows about 7 transactions per second (if I am not mistaken). So Litecoin should be able to handle about 28 t/s. But keep in mind that the total amount of transactions greatly depend on the size of each individual transaction.*

I already asked Charlie, but I'll ask it again in case it goes unnoticed by him;

Those threads only show that most people have no idea what to do. Comments like ''carry a dead man's switch in your hand at all times'' are upvoted to the top. And although I understand such comments are not serious, it just shows that the majority of Bitcoiners don't care to answer/address complicated questions/issues like this. There are some good answers, but the solutions suggested are complicated and the majority of people won't even try it. Understanding how Bitcoin works and creating a safe wallet is complicated enough, and when people start throwing technicalities like ''time locks'' around, it gets only more complicated.

It is not a flaw, but with traditional banking it's much easier. Bitcoin means more responsibilities, and most people are not waiting for more responsibilities. This is something that needs to be taken into consideration. You can't expect people to adopt Bitcoin if you straight out tell them ''take care of it yourself''.
