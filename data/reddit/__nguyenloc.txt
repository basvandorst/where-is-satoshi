I'm so stupid to use PayPal = SUP.
I just wanna be free = IWF.
1. They did not tell me that they charge 4.4% fee (Scam)
2. They did not tell me they will hold my money for 21 days (Scam)
3. They did not tell me that for them 1USD = 22,000 VND (Scam)
4. They did not tell me that they will need 2-4 days or 14 days to KNOW my transaction is smooth or not.
5. They did not email me the process as they promised
6. They did not tell me that they don't wanna answer a Vietnamese
7. They did not tell me that their phone number is not working.
8. They only tell me that I just need to tell someone transfer money to my PayPal account.
This is my story,

16. Day 16: SUP
17. Day 17: SUP
18. Day 18: SUP

21. Day 21: SUP but now I can withdraw my money. (Oh Yeah!). Oh Fuck! 1USD = 22,000 VND. Fuck Fuck Fuck! Why the fuck the payment is completed but I did not receive my money? SUP IWF

PayPal does not have customer support email. They only have this shit.  
Lols, you're so naive. You think you can call their number. Try +1-866-648-5843 for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:20:49
Now I know, many people like me, can't find the email page.
Check this 
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:18:22
Yes. It's the first scam.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:31:01
Now, PayPal wanna talk with me. LOLs . 
I told them "Go fuck yourself"

How do you know that PayPal will give my money back? 
They hold $1200 of this guy since 2016.

Lols. 4.4% fee is legit then. 
And btw, for PayPal 1$ = 22,017 VND
But for Google 1$ = 22.944 VND
I called them (+1-866-648-5843) but it's not working. I couldn't take it anymore.
I rather lose $1000 than do any business with them again.

They scammed this guy $1200 too.
Now, I know PayPal's algorithm.
TakeMoneyOfAPerson(FindRandom(Person.balance &gt;= $1000, Person.country  != USA)
They hold $1200 of this guy since 2016 too. Fuck you PayPal.

Correct me if I am wrong but I think you work for PayPal. 
And fuck PayPal, they said that if I have any question about my PayPal account, I can send them a message. 
So why the fuck you support PayPal? Not me, the one who got scammed by them.
And do you even a Bitcoinner?

You didn't get my point.
Yes, after I shared my story on Twitter and a few other places, PayPal wanna talk with me. And I told them "Go fuck yourself" 
Why I told them "Go fuck yourself" if I need to get back $1000 ?
What I did is warning people who are not aware of PayPal before. I don't get it. Why the fuck some stupid guys always thinking about the money. (Do you think it's about the money?)
It's about TIME, customer support, fees, racism, etc.
And what's Bitcoin missions? 
For me, one thing is very clear that we will remove middle man like PayPal. So fuck PayPal. OK.
