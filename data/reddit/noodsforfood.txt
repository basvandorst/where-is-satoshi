looking like we might hit 13k by end of day tbh
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:12:09
Yeah, that's what I was saying! That the hardcore, admirable BTC people for which money is secondary would never sell, they're keeping their bitcoins for when bread costs 2 satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:15:44
12.5 - we're on the run to 15 boys
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:59:36
I keep waiting for it to stop and it won't
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:21:36
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:41:17
13k on Coinbase!
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:26:16
TFW like 7% since the OP was posted
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:23:51
it'd probably be like, really great for his digestive tract or something
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:44:48
That's what I figured too
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:17:31
No. Hardware wallet is probably your safest option. The IRS is suing Coinbase in federal court right now; I'm not saying I don't trust them, I'm just saying bitcoin is meant to be trustless.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:39:08
Gotcha! The more revolutionary people would say no. I will likely cash out to fiat at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:57
I bet we beat it lmao
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:03:25
 Agree. I'd never take a short position on bitcoin nonetheless. Even *as* it is crashing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:38:38
Yeah, I realized after how ridiculous that sounded, I need my coffee 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:38:23
Jesus Christ. Can you imagine seeing BTC at 30k before New Years?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:37:05
Yeah I wouldn't be surprised to see a mini-crash down to 10k that gets bought up immediately. Normies will be waiting for a dip
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:40:42
I agree that it's totally different. That doesn't mean it won't happen. It's ran to 13k since I posted this.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:53:05
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:40:06
Mostly it's just institutional interest, banks and stuff getting involved, a lot more popularity. Cryptocurrency has been blowing up for the past few years but this run really got everyone's attention, and a lot of people don't think it's over. I agree with them and am holding
Anyone with a better explanation feel free to offer insight
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:47:03
Marked as a spoiler just so y'all know what to expect.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:14:44
I don't count on anything with BTC anymore, except the moon
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:39:01
CBOE is on the 10th also
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:29:32
Agreed. And great post Sell200.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:30:30
buying both would probably be smartest
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:46:08
woah everybody let's just enjoy these sick gainz ok

@_date: 2017-12-06 12:58:55
DON'T DO IT MAN. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:20:25
It's nothing super nuts; they noticed that there are a ton of people with more than $20k in BTC on their platform (a few thousand) but only like, 10 of them paid taxes on it so they're pissed. They want user data to investigate. 


@_date: 2017-12-06 05:34:23
Bet you we hit 100k before falling back down to 40
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:13:27
12.2K AYY
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:59:19
I don't think so - unless there's a way to use the LTC private key as a BTC private key?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:55:27
Dropped a 0. Whurps. Barely *100%. Slightly less than.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:44:26
20k is not even 100%, though. I wouldn’t be shocked if it flounders a bit before pushing through by the end of the month.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:39:56
Hey, sorry, this comment confused me a bit haha.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:14:16
"Some point" is 100k-1m probably.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:36:05
Let’s see how Wall St feels about it on the 10th ��
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:41:06
I agree it wouldn't be healthy, but the argument is that a correction after healthy growth doesn't really tend to happen with BTC. Usually it's not until shit gets really insane that there is a long-term pullback, i.e. $10 -&gt; $1k -&gt; $500 would look like $1k -&gt; $100k -&gt; $50k. I'd expect it to run to at least 25-30 before real problems.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:34:46
No, sorry; I meant BTC, and "pop" in a good way. That was pretty ambiguous I guess lmao. Stock market is getting sold off. Today's a good day for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:15:59
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:44:25
Not gonna lie, I felt bad for you until the "I bought bitcoin cash" part. Sorry but not sorry, OP.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:34:25
How do you think the futures will impact BTC price tho?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:30:32
I think today it's gonna pop again. The logarithmic growth is starting to speed up. Bloomberg has been talking about it all morning. Get ready for some cash today guys.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:45
16k. Yep.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:42:45
Yeah, I saw that Japan was planning to allow BTC derivatives trading in March or April.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:20:09
Someone's short isn't going well
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:35:09
"Pay your taxes." I was gonna say that, but trying to stay above 20 comment karma... Lmao
