I am saying technically, the limit down for today ("circuit breaker") is $8964 on Bitcoin Futures.
Could it go down more on the spot market? Sure! But in my opinion, after watching Bitcoin Futures over the past month, not by much.

If you're American, go ahead and use Coinbase if you want. They're a safe custodian for the cold-storage-illiterate. People 'round here have taken a disliking to them, what with their lack of segwit/batching implementation, and how they went about listing BCH. But let me tell you som'n, I've been in this space a long while, so I'm entitled to my opinion. And I do believe that Coinbase provides a great service still, and that they are likely working on getting those implementation issues resolved, yes indeedly-doo.
But I will also say, to anyone who disagrees with me, kindly git off my lawn thank you very much.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:28:26
Limit down is 8964.
Can't go any lower than that today on the CME. Not saying we'll get down there, but that's the limit anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:31:31
Not necessarily. Bitcoin is likely benefiting from the past 8 years of asset price inflation. A strong bout of asset price deflation could likely take bitcoin along with it. I believe that most people still categorize this space in their head as risky tech, not a store of value. I may be wrong, but only an economic recession will tell us for sure... and we haven't had one of those since Bitcoin was released in 2008.
This will be the longest bull market in US history this summer, thanks to quantitative easing around the world. Go figure Bitcoin has done so well. We'll see what happens soon enough as quantitative tightening is in full swing later this year into 2019.

An actual crash feels like Bitcoin is completely dead and done, and it truly makes you not want to buy in again at lower prices. You question it entirely, and it takes years to recover. And by the time it does, you have nothing left... 
...except the undying thought in your head saying, "Why the hell did you donate 25 BTC for a lifetime membership to the Bitcoin Foundation".
Good luck.

Nail on the head, this article covers the spread mechanics you're talking about in better detail:
My strategy is when the CBOE lists, shorts will suppress price from whatever high it's at (maybe 30k+) down to the $19.7k (current Coinbase high) to hold as support. Then when CME lists the following week, we will finally see a sharp decline back to 10k or less. You and I seem to agree the price will run into 2018 (so will US equities, I think) and then another sharp decline will occur in the summer. I think 100k is possible and that a selloff will happen around April-July.
If we're on the same page... let me know. That would be pretty cool :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:06:41
I've been trading on the CME for years, private account (mainly ES)... and I completely agree with you. I came to the same conclusion when the futures announcement was made, because that's exactly what I would do. The spot price rising now is confirmation that our analysis is correct. They are allocating the underlying to hedge against their shorts come Sunday.
It's funny how many people in this space are so ignorant to how these markets actually function, and the way commercial traders manipulate price to get the best deal/liquidity out of the market.
I also agree that they will do it again in 2018, except to extraordinary levels. That is where they will really make their money on this. Good luck :)

Also, something very interesting to watch is the spread between Coinbase (which doesn't offer short selling) and Bitfinex (which does). I've noticed that Coinbase typically runs hotter than all other exchanges, and I'm willing to bet that's because  A. it's a US based exchange with easy fiat transfers, and B. they don't have a short mechanism.
I've seen the spread push $1.5k over the past couple days which has signaled this recent top. It's awesome.

It's not apparent to me that consensus on MBS would change because of an elastic block cap.
This proposal doesn't solve the fundamental issue of whether or not Bitcoin can exist as it currently does, as both a low fee and decentralized Tx network. Realistically, this proposal only helps to resolve an issue which came up on the side of if we do nothing, as there's no need for an elastic cap on blocks filling at low capacity.
The question still remains: what do we do about the blocksize?

Just in case anyone misinterpreted the post, Meni's suggestion isn't a solution to the maxblocksize issue. The theory is that this would help with the issue of network instability as we breach the maxblocksize limit.
It's missing a few important economic variables that would still need to gather consensus. I think it's a good idea, but it doesn't attempt to solve the much bigger issue facing Bitcoin (MBS).
Perhaps it will be useful in the future if the maxblocksize issue is resolved to tightly filled blocks, but until then it's probably best if we leave it in our bag of tricks instead of focusing energy on it (right now).

Perhaps Bitpay or Coinbase could contact the developers of these little table-POS's that Brinker or Applebee's use and simply integrate a bitcoin option, which they could then turn to Brinker or Applebee's and offer at no extra charge.
That would certainly help promote Bitcoin adoption. The promotion alone will help our little economy and ultimately benefit Bitpay or Coinase in the long run. These restaurant chains are EVERYWHERE and do a ton of business with younger groups.
It would be awesome.
If I could take my friends out to a Chili's or Applebee's and show them how easily I could pay with Bitcoin... I think it would ingrain the perfect mental image of how Bitcoin works, and would be a great topic starter into the other awesome benefits of this technology.

I think we're at an interesting point in this area of space development where asteroid mining is just far enough into the future to have little effect on the longest-dated futures contracts for precious metals, but close enough that it should influence the allocation of (central) bank reserves, since those are meant to be very long-term investments and will ultimately deal with this issue. I'm not saying central banks are taking any action now, but they really should be IMO.
Once that realization occurs, which is likely to be preceded by a secret unwinding of gold positions (if it already hasn't), then modern consensus assets like fiat and sovereign bonds will do very well among trusting nations.
Ultimately (and this is many decades away), I believe the only asset that ALL sovereign nations will agree has IMMUTABLE value, not being affected by central policy changes of that country, and will be accepted as a form of payment, even by enemies, is Bitcoin... or some cryptocurrency, but likely just the dominant fork/version of the same Bitcoin we know and love.

I've personally met Jaron, the CEO, at one of our first Bitcoin NYC meetups early last year, as well as a couple others from Coinsetter. All very intelligent, experienced guys. Jaron's been through a couple interviews on national television too, for anyone interested.
They've actually been around for a long while, developing, getting the proper legalize in place. One of the more responsibly put together exchanges IMO. They didn't officially open their doors until they were prepared and actually ready to go.
I would highly recommend these guys if you're looking for a new US trading platform. Just the way they went about building this exchange suggests that they take a level-headed, responsible approach to whatever they're doing. Definitely worth the risk to try em out.
I can see them becoming one of the major US exchanges in a few years; especially for NY's HFT -- big money.

Crowd-funding using Bitcoin is just as viable and supportive of the community's broader interest, not just Keisers.

If the man really wanted to be left in peace, he shouldn't be going around town hall uncovering government corruption, unearthing the scandal behind a lack of stop signs in dangerous intersections. He brought it upon himself, this media frenzy...
You see, this dates all the way back to the beginning of January 2009, when the Los Angeles County district attorney began investigating allegations that Temple City's mayor, Judy Wong, along with city council members David Capra, and former mayor Cathe Wilson, solicited bribes in exchange for support of the proposed $75-million Temple City Piazza mall project....
At the time, a portion of those bribes were coming from the head of Temple City's Department of Transportation, Lee McGrath, in order to secure a sizable contract for a local construction company, Crewsweak. However, a few weeks after the solicitation, Mayor Wong decided to oppose the project, for reasons unknown, and threatened to veto the project all-together. In retaliation, this forced Lee McGrath to use his power as head of the city's DOT, and begin pulling down stop signs at dangerous intersections throughout the city. This action threatened Mayor Wong's reputation, as vehicular accidents were increasing at alarming rates, and a campaign of angry citizens began joking that Temple City be renamed to "Liberty City".
Soon after the government corruption hearings over the stop sign issue, instigated by the findings of one, Dorian S. Nakamoto, the scandal was uncovered by the Los Angeles County district attorney. 
Mayor Wong, the city council, and Lee McGrath were all charged with lying on fair political journalism disclosure forms... but the stop-signs were never fixed.

It's not just integration. You gotta get a ton of legal people involved, returns department needs to have a guideline set, coinbase needs to work it out with them, and all the testing that needs to get done before it rolls out so that people don't start flipping shit when things aren't smooth. A failure in any of those areas would also promote bad press, and it would  make Bitcoin, not just overstock, look really bad. A lot more was riding on this than just flipping a switch (which I would agree would have taken a few days or less under normal circumstances)

The larger global market indicators in general look pessimistic for the second half of this year. I think investors have already begun and will continue to move money out of speculative tech stocks, Bitcoin, and into defensive stocks, fixed income, etc...
Bitcoin, Twitter, Groupon, Yelp, Biotech, etc have had huge gains over 2013, and huge losses throughout the beginning of 2014. Smart money took advantage of those movements last year and have since started moving their money into safer assets in past few months. Soon, even non-cyclicals will participate in the correction which has just started in the NASDAQ...
A lot of it has to do with the Fed's shift in monetary policy beginning in December 2013, stating that QE was winding down, and that the interest rates were going to start rising soon thereafter.
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:48:50

This isn't a charity. I would look at this as an experiment. The point of this is to see if we could make some random person in our community a millionaire just for fun. We donate to charity all the time with Bitcoin. Let's try this now.

I enjoy eating out once in a while and spending money on electronics, sure that money could have gone towards a charitable cause instead, but then life would stripped of a lot of the things that make it enjoyable.

I really liked your solution with a side mem pool of encrypted transactions that miners could verify was initiated before the block was solved, but then I understood everything up until...


Lol. I want to understand what that means haha... Can you break it down for me? Maybe there is a solution to whatever that problem is. I could certainly think about it for a while :)
My guess.. doing this would reduce the strength of the cryptography used in Bitcoin because we are encrypting data multiple times in order for this to work? So there is an easier attack vector in doing so?
Edit: ahhh... Or are you referring to the order of verifying transactions which would be effected when certain transactions in their tree are secret... Yeah that would make sense... Had to google "lemma" to understand lol.

Greenbacks, well, that's a different story...
@_date: 2014-07-25 20:17:49
There's truth in this.
Additionally, if the exchange price of Bitcoin doesn't increase dramatically in the next year, even the block rewards won't be enough to keep a lot of the miners running under current losses, and transaction costs may increase and not be very competitive. The next halving is only 2 years away. Could be a very volatile time if new capital doesn't vote in favor of Bitcoin soon. 
And that's all under the pretext of a strong global economy, which we've been graced by the Fed with over the last 6 years... if that turns for the worst, Bitcoin is going to get clobbered.

@_date: 2014-05-07 23:32:10
Its not so much the velocity of new money that's the most serious issue, but the unelected direction of where the new money goes.
With Bitcoin, the miners and early adopters are in control.
With fiat, the central bank and banks are in control.
At the moment, I personally believe Bitcoin is a more balanced system of money direction, but only in comparison to older, massive, centralized systems. I also believe Bitcoin's early adopters have interests more aligned to my own and so support them by using Bitcoin.
Over time, Bitcoin risks developing into another centralized system if there are fewer and fewer mining pools, or if the richest early adopters hijack the system for their own good by manipulating the economy (Mark K., etc...)
In terms of monetary policy, I think the benifits will be short lived. But Bitcoin offers a lot of other benefits, the biggest being the first real competition to existing systems, and others like cost efficiency, the potential to move worldwide, open source, etc...

**By January 1st, 2015, if the Bitstamp price of 1 bitcoin is still above $430, I will pay you 1 BTC on that day. If at any time between now and January 1st, 2015, the Bitstamp price of 1 bitcoin falls below $430, you will pay me 1 BTC on the day it occurs.**
If I hedge my bet now by purchasing 1 BTC, I will be out $453.58 (current price at the moment) + fees if the price does not fall below $430.00 before Jan 1st, 2015.
If you put aside $430 now, you can only lose $430 + fees.
I see this as a great deal for someone who believes the price of bitcoin will not retreat to $430 ever again, as I start this bet off at a $23.58 loss.
Granted, I could hedge 2 BTC, but if I truly believe the price will go down, I will have an additional $47.16 loss + fees, for a net gain of $382.82. Naturally, I would prefer the $406.42.
Lastly, your time risk of 7.5 months is offset by the potential for unlimited gains, whereas I can only win $406.42 ($430 if I play this risk poorly).
How does this sound?

IMO, I've found that a majority of Bitcoin trading patterns are based off technical movements.
I have predicted a majority of the highs and lows using TA since being involved with Bitcoin in 2012, and what surprises me more is not that I've been able to predict these price movements, but that has the opinion this analysis is useless. And furthermore, this sub not only downvotes TA to death, but it upvotes other speculative posts which do not provide any real support for why the price actually moved the way it did.
TA is literally evidence in the form of a picture, presented right in front of your face. Maybe you guys didn't even look at the chart?
I think the comment made by "usrn" explains it best, because I can't think of any other realistic reason as to why this analysis is overlooked; it's so ridiculously obvious to me why the price dropped $50 today, and bounced off $350 a couple weeks ago, and etc...

It's data like this that show the user-base is growing and there are A LOT more people aware and using bitcoin than even a year ago. However, they just aren't as heavily invested as users were during the price-rise of last fall. Most of these new users hold small amounts of bitcoin and are waiting for the next bubble to buy in.
If we start to see an inkling of the next price-rise beginning to occur, it could easily be fueled to 10k with all these new users whipped into a buying frenzy (a lot of them now are very wealthy investors)... but I don't see this happening for a while; the dollar is gaining strength thanks to increasingly hawkish fed policy.
We will have to wait until a serious QE 5 to see another "traditional" price-rise for bitcoin. When will that happen? Probably a couple years, or at least after the next huge drop in equities/housing prices -- which will scare the fed into printing more money again.

Honestly, this proposal does more for the future than current utility requires. Though, zero-conf Tx's are already statistically not a very smart thing to do... regardless. Additionally, there will come a time when these payment processors like Bitpay, Coinbase, Coinkite, etc.. will develop their own payment networks outside Bitcoin, where Tx's are mainly off-chain for day-to-day use (like visa, discover, etc), and will use Bitcoin Tx's only to settle large amounts, like Visa using ACH to settle. This off-chain Tx layer will mitigate zero-conf double-spend attacks and it's cheaper for these payment processors anyway to do BTC Tx's in bulk.


Exactly. And by this point in time, we may see the Bitcoin mining industry go through some VERY competitive changes. To the point where certain mining companies will have consolidated the others into one or two large monopolies. As it stands today, certain pools are growing in power similar to this, with GHash.io at over 34% of the total hash rate RIGHT NOW,... and there is no way that any of us can stop this from happening.
With a feature like this implemented now, users can take steps and chose certain pools to handle their Tx's. That will at least help to slow down this growing problem from becoming a much bigger security issue in the future.
For example, all users can choose to send their Tx's only to P2Pool. This would increase payouts at that pool per block found, incentivizing hashing power to move to that pool and away from others. This now makes the entire system more decentralized and more democratically governed by using a pool that is open-source. It may take longer to get confirmations in the beginning, but over time, that pool will become larger and will close the gap on that time difference.

@_date: 2014-01-09 15:30:42
Thank you for the response! I thought about it a bit more... 
I'm okay with centralization within the pool itself, since it would be a necessary evil (like centralization within individual political parties) in order to effectively compete against some other pool with a monopoly (the major political party). The question is, technically, is it feasible for the miners to simply contribute hashpower towards solving the block, while the pool operator handles verifying transactions?
The other issue you mentioned would be that other nodes would not be able to verify these secret transactions until after the block is solved and propogated. But couldn't a miner who solves a block technically enter their own transactions and do that now? Which is why you would normally wait for a few confirmations anyway... is that logic correct?
Granted, this feature could be an interim implementation used until we get P2Pooling running as the best and easiest pool to join. With a decentralized mining operation taking control of the network, we wouldn't need to fight against that power, and all transactions could be non-specific to a pool again.

My point about SecondMarket is that big money has already shown a $60+ million interest for this bridge (within 3 months of being established), so why are you even bothered to ask this community? of course an ETF like this would make you a shitload of money in fee's. Get on with it already. And good luck competing with everyone else, like the winklevoss, who also want first to market.

I've been saying this for years... 
Granted, I've gotten a lot of what I've asked for since then (early 2013).
But whatever the transparency issue is, Andreas, leaving the Foundation won't make it better. The foundation isn't perfect, and the board knows that.
Maybe start a campaign to change the bylaws? You've got the public's ear. Be smart about this. 
A lot of people agree that institutions like the BF could use more transparency (though "complete lack of" may be exaggerating it), and I'm sure even Gavin agrees more can be done to keep it open... but naturally, he would probably also say someone needs to step up and do the work. I think that's really his main issue with most things. 
So, do we fix the old group - or start a new one? What's your real beef with the BF?

No worries thanks for responding :) 
I'll be honest, I'm not exactly sure how this is going to be implemented, but I am worried that if we still have an upper-bound (threshold for accurate verification using this method) that isn't set by the miners themselves, we still run into problems of centralized-gavin-control of Tx costs in the future. 
Do you know if Gavin is going to implement this solution in addition to the market-driven maxblocksize solution?

To me it just seems like he's just ignorant of the details of how shit really functions and why things are the way they are. Can't really blame him for that considering the multitude of work he's done in other areas not related to politics or economics. Seems like he is genuinely trying to help, though.
Like jmaller said, it seems that - lately - brand has made an effort to learn more about these things he is ignorant about and is open to new ideas and ways of thinking. I think that speaks way more than his lack of understanding. 
He's smart, he'll figure it out. And when he does, instead of saying things like poor people need money and houses (which they do), he'll suggest real initiatives for change on a pretty massive scale... because of his unique charismatic qualities that got him 8.8 million twitter followers.

To the author, 
Don't worry, as the price goes up, "Bitcoin is in a bubble", "a ponzi scheme", or "has no intrinsic value" gets thrown around by a lot of people. Realize, getting over all the negativity, just because you think you can make money off of this, is already hard enough for people to do. I bet there are actually very few people invested who don't also really understand Bitcoin's true potential. So keep in mind that price is mainly reflective of adoption, not adoption due to price. In the early days that was more prominent, but even now that is still mainly the case. All of these "Wall Streeter types" are simply people who actually understand Bitcoin just like you or I do... They just have a lot of power to foster it's growth to the next level.
We need these people. They're just as important as you are.

It's already begun. It actually started months ago
The speculation is that it will continue, even further throughout the year. 
I could ask the same of a speculator who thinks the price will go up, "How do you know this will happen?"
No one knows for sure. I don't know for sure. But you have to take a risk at some point, and I'd rather take risk based off of ALL factors of the world economy, rather than just based on Bitcoin's small ecosystem.
Taking a global perspective into consideration, things are not looking good for speculative investments as the Fed begins to reverse QE, thus forcing the reallocation of capital from emerging/speculative markets and into safer assets. This is just the beginning, and there are a lot of indicators to suggest the sentiment.

Realistically, I don't think either of us is doing it for the money, its about getting the call right. I have a feeling, based off them having said they traded for 30 years, weve both been in positions where we've lost way way more than this. 
I think the real bets we both placed are outside of this one, and probably involve way more money.

Or rather, not even discuss speculation on at all?

You know, they never define in what form the "payment" is, so this could technically just be laying out how traditional pool systems work, with a bitcoin payment at the end of the "rental", and reiterating that it's not a money service business to join a pool if you've got the hardware.

Gavin, 
I appreciate the response and wanted to personally thank you for the approach you take resolving social, economic, and technical issues regarding this community. Your thoughts and solutions have always been well-phrased, considerate, and comprehensive. Your leadership and public contributions are undoubtedly one of the reasons why bitcoin is so valuable right now. I think serious investors would've had a harder time accepting the sustainability of Bitcoin early on, without such a level-headed face maintaining this fragile project over the last few years.
Also, having a realistic view of the world definitely resonates with a lot of people and I think is healthy for Bitcoin. As you're well aware, most of us are not wearing tin-foil hat's thinking, "we're better off simply ignoring traditional institutions". I thought it was great how you publicly handled your meeting with the feds a few years back, and thought it was smart to support a well-funded Bitcoin action/advocacy group early on.
Lastly, Andreas is fantastic at public speaking, sure, but I've seen a lot of your talks and they're fantastic too. I know you don't want to be the spokesperson for Bitcoin, but you really are the guy who should be. I'm confident Satoshi chose you for more than just your programming skills; there were other guys working on the code at the time. I think he sensed the sensibility... that quality works really well in public relations.
DO THE TED TALK! :-P

I think MBS is a big issue for this community as a whole, not only because of the difference of opinion held between dev's, but because fundamentally the issue is about de/centralization, a core property of Bitcoin. And it has to be a change (if implemented) that's well ahead of when it would practically become an issue for people who support cheaper Tx's. 
For the sake of those who support Gavin, we need to be talking about this either now, or in a few months, and since we're talking about it now, we might as well just talk about it.
Forking Bitcoin does not mean Gavin get's what he wants, it just means the majority of miner's have spoken and think cheap Tx's will be best for Bitcoin's success. If it turns into another centralized currency system, then so be it. However, that will not stop people from pulling their wealth out of BTC and putting it into something with greater decentralization, yet higher Tx costs. If the price of GavinBitcoin drops because of people pulling out, then so be it... but that doesn't mean it's the end of crypto, it just means gmaxwellcoin will suddenly see an increase in capital. The two can live side by side... this isn't a zero-sum game.
One way or another, I believe this split will happen as long as their are differences of opinion. 
Obviously, people have a lot of money on the line here, and so want to try and persuade the majority to side with their version of Bitcoin1. This is a big issue!

What's your opinion of Darkwallet's code?

@_date: 2014-12-05 00:20:46
The high variance in block discovery is just a large numbers game, a product of a high total hashrate/difficulty on the network. Smaller miners just don't have the same power as the big guys. How would we reduce the high variance for little miners on Bitcoin? 
Treechains. If there was a core code change that chained-miners didn't agree with, they really wouldn't be able to influence or participate in the vote, no? I would think the point of a decentralized system would be to limit power, but it's just, either way I look at it, centralization always seems to occur over time as participation in a system grows...
I dunno, it just seems inevitable to me. Btw, thanks for the replies.

It just seems pretty unprofessional -- to the point of questioning your legitimacy -- to come on for advice on the interest of such an investment, as you have "been in the industry" and "on the internet" for so long, and should know the answer to all of your own questions posted here.
So let's be honest, if you're looking for large amounts of BTC capital via this medium, then prove, tell people why this structured product, fund, trust, etc.. will be superior, and quicker to market without similar regulatory delays. Seriously, describe your process in detail... or just stop with this hype and get on with actually doing it.

You mean it would make it hard for a small miner who hasn't been accepted by a private pool to find a block by themselves successfully (but that's been the case for a while now, even with public pools).
I'm just trying to figure out if transitioning to private pools is actually going to make a difference to the system, because it seems like that's practically what we have now... which means this "attack" is kind of moot.
EDIT: Alright, after thinking about it a bit more, I can see how private pools can be negative to smaller miners... If small-time miners don't get accepted to any large private pool (and mining alone would be effectively pointless), they won't even bother entering the market... yeah that's not good for a "decentralized" currency.
Any ideas on any solutions to this? As this work shows that we may ultimately get there... maybe just succumb to another coin? 
This inevitable outcome for Bitcoin seems to be just the tragedy of its success. Perhaps any/every system will ultimately reach a similar result and there's nothing we can do about it?
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:55:42
Someone please explain to me the current application of this. Respectfully, it seems like this is being built for a *future* use-case.
Also, if the contracts are tied to real-world stuff, you're still going to need centralized assistance of some sort, government or private, transferring the contracted item.

No. Trading BTC for USD wouldn't reduce the value of Bitcoin. When you sell BTC, it does not go to a landfill and disappear forever. Understand that someone has to buy BTC with USD in order for the trade to occur. Furthermore, Overstock is adding a huge amount of utility value to Bitcoin by accepting it as a form of payment, thus making it MORE valuable, not less. 
Now, the price decrease of BTC by Overstock.com purchasing USD is an offset to the price increase of earlier BTC prurchases made by those shopping on Overstock.com. Unless of course, people who mine a ton of Bitcoin decide to unload their holdings at the site, at which point all of this is irrelevant, since they were going to unload their BTC anyway, bringing the BTC price down somewhere else.

The next financial crisis won't fuel bitcoin's next price rise, but the measures taken by central banks following the crisis will. Unfortunately, the price of bitcoin will be negatively affected right before and during the crisis; which is partly why I'm not invested in bitcoin right now.

We are already subject to the precursor of a strong dollar policy over the next year or two. The fed has gradually been reducing their QE asset purchases since December and are scheduled to end the whole program by September or October. At which point, the Fed speculates they will begin rising the Federal Funds rths after that time.
Asset managers around the world are already shifting their wealth away from risk. This is already being reflected in the tech and small-cap markets.
tl;dr strong dollar policy from the fed means Bitcoin will get hurt

I already own 1 BTC but you are still correct, the bet is $20 stupid on my part since we started the bet $20 from the strike price.
But just so you know me, its not a stupid bet. It's a lazy bet, because I did take this all into account before I made the bet, but just didn't care enough to make a big deal over the $20. Its $20 bucks man... 
IMO, there are a lot of factors in my favor, like time and being $20 off the strike, and many factors in my oppenents favor, like an infinite gain and being $20 off the strike.
Eh, it seems fair to us, that's all that matters.

Gregory, perhaps we should just split Bitcoin. Perhaps that would be the best option for both sides, honestly. I know no one really wants to talk about it, but I think both sides have valid enough reasons to keep or change the MBS. Seriously. And if we don't do it now, the market turmoil will only be worse later down the road.
I'm being completely serious. Let's split the chain and have two different versions of Bitcoin. We know we can do this, it would just take a lot of work to reconcile in the markets (especially for private exchanges). But at the end of the day, one chain will be a more decentralized but expensive system, and the other cheaper but more centralized. People can make the choice of keeping their savings in the expensive chain for long term storage, and everyday payments can be made on the other chain. One chain can be paid for mainly by the inflation (coinbase), and the other mainly by tx fees.
Of course, you already know all this... So basically my point is just why dont we just suck it up and split this thing. This is a natural process IMO. There ARE valid reasons on both sides to do this.
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:29:48
I would even go as far as to argue that one of the reasons why the price of bitcoin is stagnating has to do with this unresolved blocksize issue; investors don't like uncertainty.

And and as a side note, I've always had this idea where upvotes are like investments that pay off with additional karma as more and more people upvote a post... you know, just to add incentive for people to go through new posts. 
Example: say you were the first to upvote a post, the next 2 upvotes by others and you receive 1 karma. If you upvoted second, you would wait until 3 others upvoted until you received karma, etc... So that people who upvote early also earn karma (albeit not as much as the OP). I think this would help with better content making it to the top.

I agree, but even the price is interesting in it's own right. The higher the Bitcoin price, the *MORE* utility value it has. Once it gets into the trillions market cap (we're not far off), financial institutions can use it to hedge against foreign currency positions or process interbank exchanges. It will also be less volatile, and have more consumer appeal as a stable currency. There's a lot that's interesting purely about price alone!

I wouldn't argue that. What I would argue is if the price of 1 Yen fell 80% to the dollar, that would be a serious problem for the Japanese economy, and for those who hold Yen-denominated assets.
Like the booming US oil industry, 10's of millions of venture capital can flow into a new industry, but if the price of the underlying commodity of that industry drops to a price lower than the break-even for whatever service or good that industry is serving, much of the new ventures in that industry will fail... 
Price matters. 


That's not true. All of the exchanges, even coinbase, make their profits on fees; the lower the price of bitcoin, the less fees they make when denominated in BTC. Furthermore, Bitpay makes money on purchase processing, typically a percentage of the transaction... same logic, if the price of bitcoin is lower, holders will have less wealth to spend, in terms of dollars in BTC, and therefore will decrease Bitpays profits in that respect.
Lastly, a lot of these companies hold a significant portion of their total assets in bitcoin, either as a hedge or long term investment strategy to help keep the price up to boost their bottom line.

That's not true. 
Bitcoin's success *is* tied to bitcoin's success. When the price goes up, that means more time and energy is being invested in Bitcoin. The opposite is true when the price goes down. Gavin isn't working for free. The only reason developers have in the past, or would in the future, is because the overall success of both Bitcoin and bitcoin depend on it, and they're all heavily invested in this after 5 years.
We can't have declining prices for Bitcoin to be successful.

You're right about the motives for why the cboe is pushing the SEC to get this done -- it does benefit them. However, this would allow for 401k's and pensions to be able to invest in btc if they want to. Right now they can't. You can't add "coinbase" to your portfolio or fund like you can with an exchange traded asset.

Doesn't Bitcoin have traceability issues that would prevent this mass influx of nefarious wealth into bitcoin? I think if Bitcoin were **actually** untraceable, we'd see a lot higher prices even today.
Also, I don't think bitcoin has enough liquidity to handle the amount we're talking about here... maybe in a few years, but we still need to find a work around over the traceability IMO.
Does anyone know a lot about Monero?
Seems like a good workaround, but I'm skeptical. I would think it would be really popular by now if it were actually as good as it sounded.
Any other ideas?

In my previous analogy, these suggestions would be akin to strictly reading the thesis of those researchers. A thesis is meaningless without evidence to support it. There's no substance to the words of hypothesis. In order to defend a hypothesis, you need the evidence which comes from action... and what a closed ballot does is hide all of the evidence (the vote).

Maybe they won't even have to. The ECB is doing all of the US dirty work right now. US gets benefit of equity inflation with a strong dollar/cheap debt financing...
Anyway, I agree. We're not even seeing core inflation move in the right direction... 
We need more spending, but I don't think the Fed can effectively stimulate with QE4+ (diminishing ROI). We need to raise wages, tax the wealth that already exists from the previous QE's, and put that money to work via government programs and benefits.
We'll see what happens. I know Janet Yellen has been [on somewhat of a crusade against income inequality]( so I think she understands what I outlined needs to be done. We all doubt the wealthy will let her do those things, though. I agree. Where's Frank Underwood when you need him.

But what would incumbent elections looks like? The incumbent would ALWAYS say they voted 100% in favor of their constituents. We'd never see new politicians in office, EVER.
The obvious problem here again is trust... As much as I would like to believe our representatives would vote in our best interest when we're not looking -- as much as I would like to believe that data you put forth -- I don't think the current population would ever trust politicians... and to be honest, neither do I! And to be honest, I don't trust a lot of people as it is! And we shouldn't have to! That's what Bitcoin solves!
I wonder if Satoshi could work on a solution to THIS trust problem lol...
I will think about this for a while, but I wonder if we can't come up with some other system to resolve this issue in government using technology... you know, like Bitcoin has... but in some other cool and unique way ;-P

OK so this point emphasizes that the important thing is getting people into congress who will actually represent us.
Let's run with that for a second...
Assuming we don't close the vote (we don't make voting secret), if we elect the same person into office who will vote in our best interests, we will have proof of that record and can vote for them again and again (much like how Ron Paul was re-elected based on his record). Yes, this opens them up to lobbying, vote-buying, and everything we're against, but at least it's not a guarantee this will happen; they *may not* become bought by money.
However, if we close the vote (we make those same votes secret), we will have no idea if that same representative actually voted in our best interest. We have no idea how well of a job they did representing us; providing the public with a guaranteed zero amount of information to go on when the next election comes around. In fact, that allows the same politician to say they voted 100% in our favor during their last term just to get re-elected again, and we would have no evidence to prove them wrong... so this may lead to people voting for the same politician over and over, who, as it turns out, may continually vote 100% *against* their interests.
EDIT: Secret ballots don't hurt the country when citizens abuse the voting secrecy to lie and say they voted for a person (when they actually didn't), just to look good among their peers. But they do hurt a country when the elected politicians abuse the secrecy to say they voted for certain LEGISLATION (when they really didn't), just to get re-elected in the next congress. In other words, what we vote on matters very little compared to what our representatives vote on. We can afford to lie about our votes, but I don't think we can afford to let congress lie about theirs.
I agree we need to get money out of politics...  but I'm not sure this is the best way to do it.

This argument... it's analogous to a company funding an R&amp;D project, letting their researchers progress for several years without supervision or corporate guidance, allowing them to keep secret all of their research data and discoveries that are made, and then come time for the investors to make a decision to keep funding the project, not having any data or proof that the project is even productive or worthwhile...
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:11:38
The *data* doesn't guarantee congress will act the same as they did pre-1970.
The *data* doesn't say much of anything on how politicians will vote in the future if we institute secret voting again. 
I think if we're going to try and convince the public to change something like this, we had better come up with a system of implementation that at least addresses the concerns I am raising. 
They are valid concerns that the public will undoubtedly share, so thinking about solutions to them now would benefit any campaign to reinsitute secret voting.

Well, how about if we also change term limits? That way even if we don't know how well they voted in the pubic's favor, they would be out of office in a certain number of years anyway...
* Institute closed ballots
* Institute closed congressional term limits (as opposed to open-ended:
* House of Representatives: 1 four-year term (instead of unlimited two-year terms
* Senate: 1 eight-year term (instead of unlimited six-year terms)
A lot of our state legislatures already have closed term limits...

I think we're all excited about this simple idea (I really am, too), that closed ballots could significantly help remove lobbying from congress, but I think it's blinding us to some logic here...


Logically, closed ballots don't just make it harder, closed ballots make it IMPOSSIBLE to determine how congress is representing your interests. We would have ZERO data on how congress votes! And that's the point! That is literally the point of a closed ballot initiative, because then neither will the lobbyists. So... maybe you meant to phrase the idea behind this comment in some other way.

They would support it if they were the ones who created it, or were involved early on. We have no idea who Satoshi Nakamoto is (possibly developers hired by the wealthy elite to create this global currency), but I do know that Cedar Hill Capital (Liberty City Ventures) mined half a million coin early on in 2010, and these are the same guys from SAC capital. Wealthy people aren't ignorant... the less smart will just take over this sector a little later (2014), making some of us nerds just as wealthy, but keeping things pretty much the same for everyone else.
Again, I'm not saying any of this is true (the Cedar Hill thing actually is), but it's something worth keeping in mind. Bitcoin isn't this saviour of the poor. And although it does solve the unequal money supply distribution problem (banks get fed money first)... for now... once miners become giant corporations, like banks, the whole thing starts all over again IMO. The random money generation isn't random when 5-10 pools collect 99% of the money supply.
The thing that really bothers me is the fact that we dont know who Satoshi is or what they're actual motives were... if I were to at least know who he was, what his background was, it would reduce my fears immensely. Regardless, Bitcoin is really awesome as a technology, so that's why I'm here.
I appreciate any arguments!!! I would honestly love to have these speculative theories be completely wrong here.

Data? Here's an absolute fact:
Open voting in Congress allows me to see exactly what my congressman votes for or against, that way I can make an informed decision on whether or not to re-elect them. Otherwise, I will be making an uninformed decision, as it will be based on whatever the politician tells me, and NOT based on their recorded votes.
My point is, there is an issue of multiple-term limits that needs to be addressed. ESPECIALLY if you have closed ballots, since having no record would exacerbate the problem of having a fraudulent representative.

Why I love the how Jon expresses himself...
"The bursting of Bitcoin technology on the scene at this time in history is not a mere  coincidence. It is a reaction to three separate epochal developments largely emanating from the developed economies: (1) centralized and oppressive monetary authority (2) a dominant and complicit legacy banking system, and (3) the eradication of financial privacy.
Future generations will not be very forgiving if the Foundation fails in its mission to standardize and protect Bitcoin worldwide. The youth of today, including the youth of the legislative and ruling classes, certainly grasp this movement and the demographics clearly bear that out. Choice in currency is the free speech of commerce."

So one issue that comes to mind with secret voting in congress: if a representative's votes are secret, on what evidence do their constituent's decide whether or not to vote for them again in the following election? Or do we simply get rid of the ability for people to run more than once for any type of office?
I think there needs to be a middle ground here... or an interesting solution to that specific problem.
Perhaps if all the votes were secret throughout the representatives terms, and a few months before election day they are released to the public?
(FYI, I think this is a great idea. I just think it has this one flaw that needs some thought worked on it.)

The price volatility you see now is due to an S-curve adoption rate into a new technology/asset, not money supply inflation. Thus, price deflation of goods and services denominated in bitcoin have actually been the inverse of this specific type and rate of adoption, rendering the typical metric of price delfation, normally due to faster economic growth over a slower money supply, as incomprehensive for bitcoin's situation.

Even through the frustration, you guys emanated a respectful yet passionate tone with him. As bitcoiner, and schiff-fan back in the day, I really appreciated both approaches and shared in the happy frustration as well. I also enjoyed when Voorhees gave Schiff the benefit of the doubt, discrediting the theory that Schiff is against Bitcoin because it competes with his gold ventures. I thought that was very sensible. I like you too, Voorhees ;-)
As a reminder, next time someone brings up the alt-alt currency argument of, "You can make/clone as many of these alt currencies as you want, we don't even know if Bitcoin will be the one to make it in the future.", let them know that Bitcoin is a melting pot, open-source system, and the good parts of other alt coins can be pulled into Bitcoin's source code. In fact, this process helps to keep Bitcoin safe in that these variations make for good testing environments before being combined with Bitcoin. So being first here really was the most important in terms of market capitalization. Bitcoin will constantly adapt to become the most dominant currency in the future, and may not even be the same system as we know it today, however all the wealth that was moved into this new digital system can remain.
The other argument of intrinsic value is unfair. Bitcoin HAS intrinsic value. Voorhees mentioned most of them, but in addition to being an awesome payment processing system (and all the benefits that come with it), decentralized store of wealth, backed by millions of people, secured by 10+ petahashes of computer processing around the world... THE PEOPLE are in control of this system, and changes to its constitution (source code) can only be accepted democratically, not by a central authority!

It's really not that secretive. It could be A LOT better when it comes to transparency (I'm one of the most outspoken about that on the foundation's forums), but it's a new org (barely a year old), peter stepped down and Matonis stepped up (which was the best move that could have ever happened) and I'm going to be patient a little while longer to see what happens... The cause is actually a good one for Bitcoin businesses who WILL have to deal with regulators, and anyone who supports the dev team's work will find donating for a membership to be worth it. Not to mention, they put together the conference which was a great time and offered a lot of publicity.
Over time, new board members will be voted in that will reflect the ideology of those who oppose the current foundation's way of doing things. Jeorg Platzer almost won this past election (he disagreed with the need to lobby and have such a focused role solely in the US, to an extent), but the simple voting methods which were used split the votes too far between other candidates like him. We're working on fixing that by trying to implement non-standard voting systems for the next election, like the schulze method. I'm sure someone like him will win next time around. There are a lot of us within the foundation who feel similarly to a lot of people in this thread and on bitcointalk. The current bylaws wont stay the same forever, or the whole thing will fall apart.

The Federal Reserve is essentially a private organization. They have no authority over Bitcoin. Only governments can impose regulations and have authority over Bitcoin's utilization.
Now, what they do or say behind closed doors to legislators is another question. Not to mention, Bitcoin could have been developed by those same people we all believe would be against it.
It has the potential two become a global currency, after all. And here we are, fueling the flames of private wealth and socioeconomic disparity.

This perspective is correct in the future (5+ years), as Bitcoin's capitalization grows to meet other major assets. If the equities markets crashed next year, I don't think Bitcoin would step in, quite yet, as a safe-haven asset. This sort of question is time-sensitive and the answer depends on if Bitcoin is mature enough to be perceived as safer than US treasuries. I just don't see Bitcoin stepping up to that role within the next few years, but I do think longer term it certainly has the potential.

1.) Undefined contributions will follow the majority. If there is no majority, they will go to the first bounty hunter's submission if there is no dispute from any other bounty hunter with a submission. If there is a dispute, they will go to the majority after the requesolution process (the resolution process involves a mixed voting process by members of the requeddit community). 
If there are no submissions to fill a request, the bounty will be returned to the contributors after the request expires.
2.) Submissions must go through a verification process in order for hunters to collect the request bounty. So if a bounty hunter never gave anyone a chance to verify (and if necessary "seed" the request), all they would have done is wasted a good opportunity to collect a bounty.
Bounties will be returned to the contributors if no submissions are verified.

Exactly. Individual risk tolerance is certainly effected by overall market sentiment. Following the 2008 crash, the Fed implemented credit controls that essentially forced people to invest, speculate, and take abnormal risks in many different asset classes. The extent of this past 5 year's sentiment was not around prior to 2007, as everyone was focused on the housing market specifically. Not to mention, computer and networking technology was not mature enough to handle something like Bitcoin's current scale in the early 2000's.
The Federal Reserve literally created a womb for something like Bitcoin to take life in these past few years.

We've been through a lot. You could imagine the amount of scams, thefts, and ponzi's we've been through ever since Bitcoin became worth something... 
You'd think for such a skeptical group, that we would be skeptical about "some new electronic money bullshit fad called bits and coins", but in fact, it's because we're so skeptical about everything and thorough with our research, that we fundamentally understand that Bitcoin is the real deal.
We also all come off sounding the same... which I find fascinating, considering that I'm sure a lot of us are completely different... funny actually... never thought of that before.
Bitcoin does that to ya, though. It's like getting laid for the first time... not that any of us would know.

I've thought about this. This service as a whole would be lethargic on Tor, reducing quality and use. So running a tor server wouldn't be preferable. On the other hand, Requeddit wouldn't be hosting any of the submissions, so I should be okay running this on a server in Sweden or Iceland. Worse comes to worse, they just shut it down... and the world opens up another one :-P

The premise of this discussion is not when the dollar crashes, because if it were, I would agree with your arguments. However, this is about "a financial crash/credit crunch type scenario". So well done. You've taken your perfectly good argument and wasted it on the wrong discussion, while insulting someone for no good reason. 
I hope something good comes out of this.

Give it a few weeks. That 10% will be drastically reduced when this current price rise in btc comes falling back to earth.
The more speculative the asset, the more volatile it is.
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:17:55
The market cap would only be about 120,000,000,000 (if it were to hit 10,000 right around now). And that doesn't take into account over a million coins that won't be touched due to being Satoshi's, held by the government, or lost.... so practically, it would be even less. 
just some perspective.

I agree. It's a good suggestion to try and develop it myself, so I'm going to give this a try. It will definitely take some time with such a wide learning curve, so I would be open and looking forward to any collaboration - consistent or not. I'm not in it for the money, so I don't care if it's open and replicated. Maybe the best way to do this is open up a github for it? Start here I suppose :)

I recommended a BUY on July 5th at 10:54 AM EST on twitter for $66.50, and a SELL around $90-$100 at the same time on Satoshi Square's Facebook group  There were obvious technical indications to justify this call. Lot's of others, beside myself indicated similar recommendations. For example, Lucif on Bitcointalk: 
I believe these next couple weeks will be very important in determining where the price goes over the next few months. I personally believe we will ultimately head back down below $50 before rising above $160 (which may not happen until next year+)... But we shall see. If the price can break above $120-$140, then I will definitely change my opinion.

1. Apparently Second Life currency is important, and that red-haired lady next to Tony knows everything about other virtual currencies because she had a Second Life avatar and knows what warcraft gold is... she also brought up ripple like it was cool...
2. Ultimately, the Treasury Dept will most likely buy USD with all of DPR's seized coins (hello lower price!) - based on Calvery's opinion as having been head of the dept that handles that sort of thing.
3. Everyone is being very cautious about regulating Bitcoin because throughout both hearings, we've instilled in them this deep fear that the rest of the world will forever take the lead in the Bitcoin space, especially China... who will become our financial overlords... and that the US economy will miss out on the benefits from this amazing new technology, the likes of which have been compared to the innovation of cell phones (according to someone who wasn't Tony)... but seriously, this.
4. Everyone on the committee sounded like they owned Bitcoin. They brought up the rise in price many times, as if starry-eyed and in awe. One committee member said, "why don't we just leave it alone? let people make their own choices and take responsibility for their actions?" Another talked about how his business-owner constituents would be thrilled over how much money they'd save by processing their payments using Bitcoin. Only a nickel! Show'em Tony! (Tony holds up a nickel)
6. I never got the impression like there was a conspiracy going on to destroy or over-regulate Bitcoin. Hardly any of them except for Tony seemed to even relatively understand it. Tony really brought home the point that Bitcoin has both good and bad users, just like anything else, and everyone genuinely agreed that was the case; especially Calvery and Schumer, who helped to take down Liberty Reserve. They both proved that they understood the difference between Bitcoin's illegal and "legitimate" uses, and that Bitcoin isn't this magic technology that hides criminals, because they were able to prosecute DPR and pirate... a very level-headed, responsible, and sensible perspective on Bitcoin.
After watching the hearing, I was left feeling optimistic about the future of Bitcoin with government involvement (at least for now). Mostly everyone in the hearing admitted or declared, in one word or another, that Bitcoin was going to be very successful and beneficial to society, which was why they held these hearings as a precaution in the first place. 
The humor here is, these are people who unknowingly cause their own governments demise by reducing the value of how they finance their debts. Almost zero discussion was held on how this could replace government currency and the implications behind that, with most of the focus directed towards a shiny new technology that will defeat unemployment, reduce payment processing costs, increase tax revenue, provide banking access to all, and save the world.
It seems that this direct, straight-forward approach of working with the government, along with their ignorance of Bitcoin's potential, is paying off (so far). It's ironically similar to how the current banking system maintains it's delusion of benefiting society, by being so complicated that most people don't understand the true implications of such a system...
except that now the tables have turned in our favor :)

It's a long story, but ultimately I couldn't find any developers among my circle of friends who could implement this idea. I was working with a couple of guys who were very interested at first, but real life got in the way and the Bitcoin learning curve probably threw them off, so things ultimately slowed down to a halt.
I know BitcoinTalk has an impromptu area where people list bounties, and other sites exist that are kind-of-not-really similar, but they definitely do not offer the same benefits/services as this. The most significant difference probably being the way disputes are resolved.
Figured I would share it with you guys now, for feedback, and if anyone was interested. Maybe it will spark an idea for something else, I don't know. I have constantly found myself wishing something like this did exist though. I would certainly use the service, myself.
Maybe someday.
Anyway, here was the project outline I sent out (I'd recommend just reading the attachment at the very bottom due to formatting issues):
looks to long;wont read: An anonymous service to request anything, add bounties to requests in bitcoins (which others can also contribute to), fill requests and collect bounties, process and resolve disputes without host involvement (utilizing user base resources, ratings, reputations), and including social interactions features such as user picks, request ratings, etc...
