The network effect is completely irrelevant when friction between various currencies is near zero, and friction will be near zero.
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:30:14
But those layers on top of the bitcoin network are going to be services provided by various groups, who without a doubt will include other currencies. When Cryptocurrencies go mainstream, we won't be using bitcoin-qt. Have you seen the Jaxx wallet, which supports BTC ETH DAO and DASH? It has built in Shapshift functionality. If everything feels like one network, and is in the one wallet, then it doesn't really matter. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:15:03
Perhaps. But then again, perhaps not. I completely agree that there will always be a currency in the number one spot, and that most people will be working with it, but to say that that currency will fill every use case, and that it will be accepted literally everywhere is ridiculous. Like I said above, some properties are mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:52:22
Sure, not for the majority of people, but absolutely for a significant minority. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 18:30:30
I disagree. I think that certain currencies have certain desirable properties that are inherently in contradiction to other desirable properties. One that comes to mind is transparency vs anonymity. Both are desirable in different contexts, but can't exist together. I see no reason why there MUST be one global currency, especially considering the lack of friction in services that handle conversion.
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:39:24
Do you think the most secure encryption is standard? Nope. The one that is good enough is standard. People won't care that Bitcoin is the most secure, as long as other currencies are secure enough.

Sure, but you're weighing very very small fees for potentially very large advantages of properties that other currencies have. Do you think layers on top of Bitcoin will somehow be free?

It would be like running any other program on a schedule. If you're mining with your cpu,  is a good option, as Bitcoin mining requires specialized hardware.

It depends on your definition of drug related violence. In the United states, the primary source of drug related violence is from the police. Most drug related crimes are more so due to poverty than drugs. Unless you are talking about the Mexican drug wars, which I think happens as a result of competing underground businesses.

@_date: 2015-12-26 21:10:04
But they don't have to accept it, and they might stop accepting them if they are not making enough in fees. Miners want to make the most amount of money possible. So, they will require enough fees to make profit. They will never stop accepting low fees as long as they are making a profit. As soon as they do, other miners will take those transaction along with the fees. So, the point where fees become profitable to miners is the point where fees will be accepted. And it won't be too expensive for users, considering the volume.

They would be very wealthy, but unless they also owned the means of wealth or production, it wouldn't be a huge deal. In a world where someone holds that much wealth, I would imagine that there do exist other entities which control the means of production or other such essential components of society, and would very quickly absorb the wealth of a wealthy person if that wealthy person were to ever spend it. You can't simply purchase the means of production. It is more valuable than any amount of money.
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:56:36
I consider that theory, but I'm not convinced. I need more evidence one way or the other. I don't need speculation. I need tangible evidence, and both sides are lacking majorly.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:41:38
Ok, so we have established that it has an insignificant benefit to some people. Now, can you explain why you think it resulted in more damage than the alternative? If not then you have absolutely no reason to condemn it. Or you at least should be focusing a majority of your condemnation on the alternative. Maybe both are bad (I don't think so), but the silk road is at least better than the alternative.

Enlighten me.
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:05:14
If anything, it opened up the market for non cartel dealers. It created a place for sellers to sell without physically being in the cartels area and thus avoiding violence by them. Either way, your argument still makes no sense as the damage is primarily a result of the product being illegal.
We are both just speculating at this point. Until you can empirically prove that the silk road made things worse than it was without the silk road, you have no argument. Without evidence, we should assume no damage was done. You must also show that the damage was not due to it being illegal, as if the damage only exists when it is illegal, there ceases to be justification for it to be illegal in the first place.
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:07:32
It doesn't get rid of them. It decreases them.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:57:20
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:53:19
Sure, drugs aren't the best, but a majority of the damage is due to the fact that it is illegal. If it were legalized and treated like other legal substances there would be far less of an issue. Just imagine what would happen if sugar were made illegal. I'm not a fan of sugar, but making it illegal creates a much larger problem. Underground markets are inherently dangerous, especially when there is no solid community regulation. Legalize them, and you remove a great deal of the danger, primarily because things are out in the open and able to be scrutenized. If someone takes advantage of me on in an underground drug market in a back ally, I can't say shit. If I do, I get in trouble for buying drugs. If drugs were legalized, and a person in the public local market tries taking advantage of me, I'm going to announce to the whole community that this guy is doing bad business.
So, please continue to tell me how an open drug market causes more damage than the existing system. Seriously. I'm asking you to explain it.
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:53:59
It's a legitimate point. How will they make a profit from this? They are hardcore in the profit area. Not so hardcore in the change the world for the better department. Somebody needs to show me how they can possibly get their money back without corrupting the software.
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:58:03
My argument doesn't rely on the silk road solving all of the world's problems. It just has to be better than what is currently happening. And it is. Sure it doesn't get rid of the cartels, but it does create a cleaner business environment that even the cartels would benefit from, and would reduce the need for violence. That being said, the evils of the cartels are similar to the evils of so many large businesses who out source their production to third world countries. It's bad. The current system doesn't fix it. Why disregard a slightly better system that also doesn't fix it, but fixes other problems? What are your priorities here?
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:51:25

The total amount of US currency in circulation flows through the government roughly twice a year via taxes. No amount of money stands even a slight chance against this. Inflation is a big deal in conjuction with the tax system, as it is strategically produced and given to particular entities that are functional/essential to the system as a whole. Someone who owns 2/3 of all the bitcoin would be like an extremely limited reserve with no power to gain value back. The money would be best spent on creating mechanisms which gain ownership of the means of production, as the means of money isn't accessible to people via bitcoin. They would be purchasing mechanisms that give the owner a piece of the means of production against opposition to already established systems which control the means of production.
So yes, they would be able to have an impact, but only a miniscule one in comparison to entities through which a large portion of the money flows through on a regular basis. I'm not sure if I am communicating this clearly... let's say there is someone today who holds 2/3 of the current wealth. Let's remove the federal reserve for simplicity's sake. The government then spends 1/3 of all of the wealth twice a year via money received via taxes. That means in two years time, it will have made twice the possible financial influence that the entity who owns 2/3 of the wealth can possibly make in two years. So basically, it has the ability to have a greater influence for anything under a year. At the one year mark, it will be even, and after that, the government will have had more of an influence. So, the rich entity would have to completely change the game in less than a year.... which, in reality is far more difficult than what I am describing here.

Do you shop at businesses that sell products produced in third world countries? Cartels are similar to any other large business in that regard. Sure McDonald's isn't good for me, but it also isn't illegal, and I don't think it should be. The business isn't one I would like to support. In fact, I would say it is down right bad. Take alcohol for example. Terrible substance. What was worse, legal or illegal? The point is that having a fair system that gives power to consumers is better than the opposite. Also, transparency is very important. Being an underground market makes transparency almost impossible. The same market made legal is far more transparent as people are no longer afraid to call out injustice for fear of punishment. The silk road created a small world where people were not afraid to call out injustice. Punishment for injustice was that you could no longer take part in business there. It's a good system. Better than the typical underground market. Again, you can bring up the source of the drugs, but that's a moot point as your system is failing miserably in that regard. And if you still shop at common stores, you don't really care either.

I think you are smart, and good intentioned, like the rest of the small blockers. But, I also think I am smart, and good intentioned, and I don't see small blocks as a good idea. I'm completely open minded though.
The irrational outbursts of many XT proponents is understandable, considering the situation that they are apparently in. That being said, I don't see the XT experts as rash and unscientific (at least not in any way that you could say small blockers are not). There are thoughtful arguments on both sides, from what I can see. The way I see it is that we will learn through experimentation. Excessive restrictions remove potential. Not to mention that in the case of block size, the fear seems unjustified to me.

Also, It reduced the need for traveling with drugs, thus reducing the chance of being caught with drugs during routine and petty traffic stops. Again, I'm not suggesting that the silk road fixes everything. I'm just saying that it is better than the alternative, and that an even better option would be to legalize the sale and consuption of such drugs. I'm willing to have a few more people doing drugs for the benefit of increased transparency. I'm not afraid of people who do drugs. I'm afraid of police and poor/desperate people.

Owning all the money is not the same as owning the supply of money. For example, I could own all the money, but as I spend it, it gets less, until the point where I don't have much money, and I can't do anything about it. With the current fiat setup, they literally have all the money all the time. They let us play with it just enough to keep a productive ecosystem. In reality, the total sum of us dollars flows through the government about twice a year. In addition to that, they can print more whenever they feel like it. Pretty fucked up if you really think about it.
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:29:52

You're basically saying you don't know how they are going to fork, and therefore you're afraid. That's fine. You could sell all your coins before the fork if you're afraid. That would solve all of your fears. Or,  you could find out the details of how they are planning the fork, so you could make an educated decision. Or you could trust the developers. Trusting the developers is not my favorite choice. On the other hand, if bitcoin requires people to understand these sorts of issues, I have a feeling it's going to have a very difficult future. I think the developers have learned a great deal from the shortcomings of the ETH/ETC fork. This time around, the developers are much more conscious of the potential problems of a fork. Both Core and BU are looking into these issues and finding solutions to them. I'm personally not worried at all.

I agree for the most part, but you are ignoring the current political climate. Segwit as a softfork apparently isn't being accepted. I'm not suggesting that segwit is an anyway attached to the blocksize limit, except in a political sense, which has been proven to be significant. If you don't want to unnecessarily delay segwit, then bundle it with a blocksize increase. Bitcoin is not so small of a project that it can any longer ignore politics. If it continues to do so, it is deliberately committing suicide.

This is from Peter R, on the BU Slack:
" and I just presented at Coinbase.  I think it all went really well and that we won over a lot of people.
Some initial thoughts:
- Exchanges/wallets like Coinbase _will absolutely_ support the larger block chain regardless of their ideology because they have a fiduciary duty to preserve the assets of their customers.  
- If a minority chain survives, they will support this chain too, and allow things to play out naturally.  In this event, it is very likely in my opinion that they would be referred to as something neutral like BTC-u and BTC-c.  
- Coinbase would _rather_ the minority chain quickly die, to avoid the complexity that would come with two chains.  Initially, I thought there was a "moral" argument against killing the weaker chain, but I'm beginning to change my mind.  (Regardless, I think 99% chance the weaker chain dies from natural causes anyways).
- *Coinbase's biggest concern is "replay risk."  We need to work with them to come up with a plan to deal with this risk.*
- Although I explained to them that the future is one with lots of "genetic diversity" with respect to node software, there is still concern with the quality of our process in terms of our production releases.  Two ideas were: (a) an audit of the BU code by an expert third-party, (b) the use of "fuzzing tests" to subject our code to a wide range of random inputs to look for problems.  
- A lot of people at Coinbase want to see the ecosystem develop second-layer solutions (e.g., payment channels, LN, etc).  We need to be clear that we support permissionless innovation in this area and if that means creating a new non-malleable transaction format in the future, that we will support that.  
- Censorship works.  A lot of people were blind to what BU was about (some thought we were against second layers, some thought there was no block size limit in BU, some thought we put the miners in complete control, some thought we wanted to replace Core as the "one true Bitcoin," etc.)"

That was a confusing way to say nothing.
This is a political post about Rand Paul in relation to bitcoin. He was stating his opinion on the topic just as everyone else was. If you want the reasoning behind his opinion, ask him.

It's really not about Bitcoin succeeding. It's about the concepts and ideals behind Bitcoin succeeding and going mainstream. Bitcoin is obviously the most mature crypto at this point, but if someday it dies, and a superior cryptocurrency gains mass adoption, we should all be very happy.

@_date: 2017-03-29 16:23:55
Segwit as a hardfork plus a blocksize limit increase to 2MB would solve everything for everyone, everywhere, all the time, for infinity and beyond. There would be a clear super majority of nodes and miners in favor, if Core would be ever so slightly flexible and get behind such an idea. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:57:12
Exchanges are businesses and are likely to do what makes good business sense. The exchanges that DO deal in both chains will probably add an equally descriptive tag to each coin("Core" and "Unlimited" ) rather than naming one of them an alt coin before knowing which will turn out to be dominant. Exchanges know full well that the coin used most often will take the name Bitcoin, as the greatest number of people consider it to be so. Once a champion emerges, exchanges will drop the tags, and give the loser its naturally acquired altcoin title. BitcoinCore/BCC BitcoinUnlimited/BTU or something like that.

@_date: 2017-03-29 21:40:15
I don't understand where the disagreement is, other than that Core should compromise at least slightly. There HAVE been plenty of compromise offers from the other side of the fence. BU might not be compromising, but that's irrelevant. Bitcoin Classic is the perfect example of a compromise. I believe the only reason it wasn't accepted is because the already trusted and established dev team isn't the group that was offering it.

Most people want larger blocks. If the only change in a fork were larger blocks, people would absolutely go there. ETC is a great (albeit somewhat reckless) example of how a fork like that could work. ETC had way less support than the larger block camp in Bitcoin. If a fork like that were to happen, everyone would be on both chains. Only those who held a strong opinion would move first. Miners will jump to the new chain as an obvious place to make some good money, just like they did with ETC. Even miners who disliked ETC mined it, as it was profitable. There is almost no question that an organized and intentional fork of that nature would be extremely successful. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:53:36

The efficiency is very important, I agree. But to say that the security isn't important is ridiculous.

Lel. Merely growing pains. If stupid people have the power to kill bitcoin, it was destined to die anyway. Thankfully stupid people can't kill it.

The problem is that nobody else means that when they refer to an altcoin. Your definition isn't useful, nor is it intuitive. Try to make your point without using very strange definitions. Untill stronger definitions are established,  the best we can do is use terms in ways that people understand, or propose new/adjusted definitions for their utility.

Damn right. Open source software does not function on a political system, but rather a rough survival of the fittest mechanism. If XT doesn't eat standard bitcoin, then it wasn't meant to be. The software that survives is the one best suited to survive. It doesn't matter if there is one dev or 100 devs all working on the same version of bitcoin. What matters is that if the devs do something stupid, other devs can pick up the source and run with it. That's why open source software still exists today. Forking forking and more forking.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2015-08-03 11:42:07
Are you suggesting duckduckgo doesn't work well?
Also, I do compromise. I don't run open firmware, and I use proprietary drivers. I have all the functionality with a little bit of sense for the future. If you are not concered with making decisions now that might effect the future positively, why are you in r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:26:56
How much profit have you made?
You are using a system that is designed to benifit the users of the system, and by doing so, you are increasing the value of said system. Same thing goes for other software. Not all profit is monetary. Privacy, security, comfort, etc are valueable. Sometimes money can get us those things, but sometimes it is at an unreasonable price. That's where open source comes in. It creates valueable things that work because the people who use it are looking to gain that valueable thing without the monetary cost, which is naturally very high. You can profit all you want, but if the things you value are not available at a reasonable monetary price, then you don't get what you actually value. Bitcoin is special because it is more than just monetary value. It gives its users something that other currencies don't. In particular it gives the user secure control of their money, among other things. If that isn't valueable to people, bitcoin is pointless, and there are far better ways to seek monetary profit.

The real question is who controls our bitcoins. The answer to that is complex. In part, we all control them collectively. Also, market forces, physics, etc. As is about to be whitnessed with the rise of XT, those who seek to control our bitcoins will fail. They can't control the masses, which control bitcoin. As soon as the devs mess something up, 100 other devs can pick it right up. That's the beauty of a completely unregulated market, in combination with open source software. It's invincible!

If that is Satoshi, I must admit, he doesn't seem as intelligent as I thought he was. No system will succeed by following any "original vision". This person seems to think that bitcoin will succeed based on whether or not individuals make the right choices. Any system built on that will fail. If bitcoin succeeds, it will be because of it's engineering. If it fails, it will be because of it's engineering. Forking is good. More forks, more engineering. If 99% of the forks fail, who cares, as long as one survives. This is cyberevolution. Diversity and experimentation will be the success of bitcoin as a concept. If bitcoin fails, there must be a bitcoin2.0, or bitcoin whatever.

This seems very misleading to ms. As a "big blocker" I advocate side chains, payment channels or whatever. What I don't advocate is REQUIRING that people use those extra features.

Nothing is free. If you want the services that bitcoin has to offer, you will have to pay one way or another. Transaction fees makes the most sense to me.

Bitcoin allows us to participate in currency for the first time. Let's take advantage of that.

Programatic consent, or dev consent? Neither make any sense whatsoever in this context. You can poll for user approval, but it's up to the devs to make sure they get accurate polls. Once they feel like they know what people are looking for, they make it, and if they make it well, it succeeds. If they don't make it, in the open source world, anyone can make it. And that's how forks take over.
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:26:14
Benevolent dictatorship has been a very successful concept within the open source world. We don't mind having a dictator, as long as there are other dictators to choose from, and the freedom for anyone to be a benevolent dictator. May the best dictator win. Or should I say, the benevolent dictator with the most followers IS the one that is winning. It's completely dynamic though. If a benevolent dictator screws something up, he looses followers. As long as things are open source, this all works well. Politics within a particular implementation is the less important piece of the puzzle.

Have you taken into account the increase in the value of bitcoin in 6 years? I have no idea how to setup a miner, but with this, I don't have to know how. Maybe I just want to contribute to diversity on the netowrk. There are a few cases where this little guy makes some sense. It's not for everyone though.
@_date: 2015-11-26 01:36:36
Yeah... it does. It's like words. It would be stupid to consider words a commodity. Or ideas. Or information. These are more similar to bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't exist like gold does. Bitcoin exists like a song exists.

I would never suggest that only the code needs to evolve, nor would I suggest trying to make a one-size-fits-all. Rather, I'm suggesting we make one size fits as many as we can and especially to fit those who need most.
I'm interested in technology which works to solve humanitarian problems. I'm not at all interested in technology which does not do that. I'm especially upset when it seems that a peice of technology could have helped more people, but refused to for political reasons.
Regarding the devs, I don't trust them. I don't trust any human being, especially those who hold some amount of power. Those with power are those who we should be most critical of. I do trust systems which have been proven to provide results. I think diversity is one important part to achieving less areas of power concentration. Any group which activity removes diversity is not a group I would stand behind.

I totally get what you are saying, and I agree. For amatures, mining is not a reasonable option anyway. But when it comes to amature mining, this little thing is a decent option. It will eventually pay for itself, and offer some diversity on the network. Not a bad option for people who are interested in something like that.

What exactly is your argument? You say it is bad that some people have a large amount of wealth, but you have no problem ignoring the fact that our government has the means of taking as much of the wealth as it(or the bankers who hold it by the balls) sees fit. The worst that satoshi could do is spend the money. It's not a monopoly on the ownership of money.
2.2 trillion is significant when in the context of the total wealth of this nation. It's not that they have or can have a large amount of money, it's more that, they can have ALL of the money whenever they want.
If you can't see why government is scary, read a history book. Any history book. Governments are not beyond the reach of greedy powerful people who lack humanitarian instincts.

No, actually it is designed to bring people in to the big exchanges by filling an artificially created void in bitcoin's functionality. The feature isn't at all useful. Infact, it's a massive finacial security risk, not for the exchanges of course, but for their victims. They are just doing business as usual though.

Even in this case, I don't think they are a commodity though. Your drivers license isn't a commodity. The ones and zeros of a bitcoin are completely useless without the network. They have no value in and of themselves. Just like a drivers license. It's useless piece of plastic. It's value is determined by what it means in a particular context. That isn't a commodity from my understanding.

Not him specifically, but there are tons of bad ideas floating around with no regard for their dangers. Not to mention plain stupid comments regarding XT that are generally being praised. My comment about big business is purely speculation, but it is something that should always be on the front of our minds. Bitcoin doesn't protect against blatant stupidity. If we put all of our coins in another persons pocket, we should expect them to disappear. While it is just speculation, there are plenty of examples in the past regarding monetary manipulation. Understanding how it was done will give some insight on how it might happen again in the future. The amount of ignorance in this sub about how it has happened in the past makes me afraid. The ones who are leading seem to be leading in a dangerous direction. From where I sit, this looks either ignorant or malicious, and I don't know these people to be generally ignorant, so I'm leaning strongly toward malicious. That being said, who can blame them? Whenever someone is offered the riches of the world in echange for ethically grey decisions, it always goes the same way. I'm not criticizing anyones character. I'm just upset that people are not cautious. Obviously, this particular thread doesn't directly relate, but it triggered my feelings.

That may absolutely be the case. I'm just not a big fan of giving people the benifit of the doubt when something important is at risk. They may not have a conflict of interest, but it is something that should be looked at carefully, thoroughly, and continually when it comes to these sorts of things. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:40:19
I understand what you are saying. Don't you think we should preemptively make the bitcoin protocal ready to handle all payments, so that in the case that any individual wanted to avoid side chains, they could? I see sidechains as filling a small use case, but I don't see any reason to make sidechains more neccessary than they would be with a bitcoin protocol made to it's full potential. Sure, bitcoin won't die if we remove it's usefullness to the general public, but if we can make it useful to the general public, why would we not?
For the record, I had nothing to do with your downvotes.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:57:26

Interesting video. I agree that centralized mining is a bad thing if it becomes too extreme, but I'm not so sure his solution is a very good idea. The way I see it, if mining is profitable, people will do it. We don't need 11 year olds mining bitcoin. We just need enough diversity to make centralized attacks too difficult.

@_date: 2015-10-14 06:41:29
It doesn't make sense to you because you seem to be confused about what I am saying. Increasing the block size grants you your functionality WITHOUT having to trust a corperation. Businesses are not trustworthy. They never have been and they never will be. They do one thing, and one thing only. They make money. They are not benevolent organizations who care about your finacial security. This side chain nonsense is an attempt to throw off the current power balance. I'm not advocating slow processing. I'm advocating as fast as possible processing while still keeping financial security in mind. I use exchanges all the time. I do NOT keep my money stored there. I keep my money in the safest place possible.
The need for these side chains is an artificially created problem that can be fixed without sacrificing finacial security.
@_date: 2015-10-09 00:34:53
By investigating every possible positive.
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:38:42
I'm not upset that the service exists. I'm upset that bitcoin is being portrayed as slow, due to an artificially created problem, and that that problem is used to say we need sidechains.
I don't care what you do with your coins. I'm not criticizing you. I'm criticizing the people who actually make descisions that negativly affect a large number of people, and that they are doing so in a slimy way.
Less than 10 minutes for a confirmation is rediculously fast, considering the available options for fiat (not sure what you meant by an hour). Again, I don't mind the service existing, and I don't mind that you use it. It's none of my business. What is my business is measleading information meant to be used to take advantage of unsuspecting victums. Liquid is designed to reel in masses. Not professional traders.
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:47:59
While you are technically correct, that isn't the way people see it. Most people believe bitcoin will become slow and delayed due to the small block size. Liquid offers an alternative solution to that problem, which will remove the need for the block size to ever increase. Those who don't want to trust the exchanges with their coins will want to directly use the blockchain, but will be faced with delays, as many many people will be transfering via the exchanges, and won't feel the delays of their transactions.
So yes, block size does not currently have anything to do with it, but it is important to consider the future. Raising block size assures people that bitcoin will not be slow for them in the future (10 minutes is not slow). It doesn't stop things like liquid from existing and serving the small number of people who are interested in such a service (not currently a small number of people because they are afraid of slow transactions in the future).

Anyone and everyone is a mod. Those who advertise themselves as mods and have a good reputation on the forum would be good choices to select as your mod. What you see would then be filtered by their modding. You could act as a mod, and advertise that you are doing so. People who respect you would then select you as their mod. Pretty much a completely decentralized moderation mechanism.

People with excessive amounts of money is scary, but not nearly as scary as someone owning the means to wealth,  or owning a mechanism which takes 20% of everyone's wealth. You have to consider how much money is flowing. In cases like satoshi, it's really not a big deal as more coins are not flowing into it. Let's look at the US government for example. The government collects about 3.7 trillion dollars EVERY YEAR in taxes. Would you like to know how much money is in the hands of the population?  Around 1.2 trillion. If you want to be afraid of something, there it is.
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:42:19

Less than 10 minutes to transfer is rapid. Increasing the block size protects against delays caused by spam.

I understand what you are saying, but I am not sure it is true. What factors are you taking into account to calculate the actions benefit? Or is this based purely on speculation? I'll be honest, I'm just speculating, but at the face of it, I am not convinced that the payout for being altruistic is greater than the payout for not being altruistic in this particular case. I'm sure there are miners who would agree with you, and there are miners who agree with me. Untill some data is presented which suggests one way or the other, your claim that altruism is benificial to the individual in this case might be true, or it might not.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:00:37
Boo. Wtf is the point of having bitcoin if you keep it in someone else's bank account? If you're keeping your coins in someone else's pocket, you're doing it wrong. Why is there so much positive feedback back on this? Do people actually have real problems with transferring coins that isn't a direct result of having too small of block size?
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:56:26
I completely agree, but no acts take place which don't have a selfish bearing. Some also have an altruistic bearing, but not all. The point is that we can't rest purly on altruism. That doesn't work. What we need to do is make the selfish things we do also altruistic.
Writing posts on reddit fulfills entertainment needs, as well as refines my thought abilities, which makes me feel good about myself. Various selfish motives causes me to do the things I do. I realize that altruism is benificial in the long run, so I try to do the most altruistic things that I enjoy.

Which is why we should stick with the system that is blatantly doing this on massive scales. The fact that it is theoretically possible that what you are saying could happen, as it is highly unlikely, and our current system already does it. So you should have nothing to worry about. Worst case scenario is that you have 100 years of a prosperous currency.
@_date: 2015-10-12 12:54:31
No, the long term gain or loss has no direct connection to the individual act of altruism. It is directly connected to the communities cooperative altruism, which is out of the individuals hands. In the case that everyone is altruistic, it is most benificial for me to not be altruistic. And if everyone is not altruistic, it is still most benificial for me to not be altruistic.

What is the purpose of liquid? It seems to be an incentive to store your bitcoin in one of the major exchages rather than keeping it in a personal wallet. How is this different from keeping cash in a large bank? Or is that the point? Also, what sort of mechanism exists to ensure that the validators are trustworthy?
@_date: 2015-10-12 15:41:02
What I wrote was a response to your points. A counter is necessary, unless you have no counter, in which case, I think you should rethink your points, as they don't address what I wrote. Communal altruism only works if there is some mechinism of accountability. In this case, there is no accountability. The actions of the community does not depend on whether or not I am altruistic in this particular situation. In the case that the community is altruistic, I don't personally benifit from being altruistic. In the case that the community is not altruistic, I still don't benifit by being altruistic.
