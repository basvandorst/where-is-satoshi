I don't disagree that government wants to prevent tax evasion, but money laundering statutes are really about keeping criminals from hiding their assets from the government, which will seize them precisely because the assets were involved in some outlawed activity.


The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is explicitly an anti-tax evasion law that was passed in 2010. It was enacted mostly with Democratic support, and was done not in the name of the "children!" but of "jobs!" because Democrats wanted a way to pay for the tax breaks they wanted to give to businesses to hire more people. FATCA attempts to place a burden on financial institutions *everywhere in the world* to report to the IRS about their US clients, and also burdens US citizens to report if they have money stored abroad (caution to US citizens who have money in bitcoin exchanges!). In spite of its overreach, I haven't heard too much complaint in general regarding this anti-tax evasion law. The Republican party made some noise about it this week, but good luck getting Obama and the Democratic Senate to agree to repeal it.

The title is still misleading. California did not pass it; the California Assembly did. It still has to pass the California Senate and then be signed by the governor. 
I don't see why this bill will not eventually become law. All it does is amend existing law to say that the use of alternative currency is not prohibited as long as that currency is redeemable for or has a value based on USD. It doesn't seem like such a big deal to me, unless you were afraid that the state would "ban" bitcoin, whatever that means. The bigger hurdles that users of bitcoin face are all the state and federal laws that make it difficult or even a crime to move money in certain circumstances or in certain ways.

So true. The irony is that Fed has a bald-faced policy of making your USD worthless by 2% every year. Everyone knows (or should know) that their buying power with dollars diminishes from year to year, but because it's so small, most people don't complain. Maybe if people did the math and saw what damage this little yearly inflation does after 5 or 10 years, they would wake up and do something about it.

Congress often cedes authority in very broad or vague language, and agencies sometimes will exercise that authority in ways you might not expect. Congress does not have use specific words like "bitcoin" or "digital currency" in its laws for an agency to find some reason to think that it can to issue regulations that will affect such things.

Do banks have the potential to interface the bitcoin ecosystem? Yes, for example, when I want to wire money from a US bank to a bitcoin exchange.

Anyway, she said that she does not see the authority to regulate bitcoin, possibly due to the fact that she has not really thought through what it means to regulate it. We can just leave it at that for now.

What does what I have say have anything to do with needing to take an intro to personal finance class? I am laying out the base case for what is happening to your fiat buying power as a result of government policy. This is true regardless of where you decide to put your money.
Pray tell what accounts pay more than 2% interest every year. A CD where you have to lock up your money for 5 years? 
Buying real assets or securities in search of an increase in price is far from a guarantee (see last housing crisis or any of number of stock market crashes), and government shouldn't be forcing or driving people into making those decisions by making their money worth less every year. The people who really get the short end of the stick are those who want to earn interest on savings and do not have the stomach for the volatility of stocks or real assets.

I have a friend in a similar situation and told him to print out the electronic bank statement, scan it and submit it. As long as it looks like it could have been mailed to you (i.e. it has your name and address on it), isn't obviously downloaded (e.g. it doesn't say "electronic statement download on Nov 18 2013" on it) and is an image rather than a searchable pdf, I'm guessing Bitstamp will not be able to tell the difference. Worse thing that could happen is that they reject it and tell you to submit something else.

So my question is how you can justify advising that bitcoin should be treated as a capital asset and not foreign currency. What is a capital asset? What are the characteristics of bitcoin that make it a capital asset and not foreign currency?

1000 responses that are properly sampled over the entire US population will give you a 3.1% margin of error at a confidence level of 95%. After a certain population size, it does not matter how big the population is. This [site]( explains how to calculate MOE. Try entering the numbers into this [calculator]( and see what you get. Enter a sample size of 1000 from a population of 300 million then try 3 billion and then 30 billion. You'll see that the 3.1% MOE does not change. Don't get hung up over your gut instinct about the sample size. Trust in the math!


This has no effect on MOE. But it does affect the nature of the conclusion that you can draw from the survey. If you pose your question in a certain way, then your survey might not tell you what you think it tells you. This has nothing to do with sample size, though.


landlines, younger people are more likely to use cellphone.
This is a valid concern and has to do with whether your sample was properly drawn from the population. According to the [survey]( people were reached through both cellphones and landlines. Most if not all pollsters these days are well aware of this issue and take it into account. If they don't, *then* you would be suspicious of their conclusions. But again, that has nothing to do with the size of the sample and more with how the survey is conducted.

I'd also make sure that you draft, sign and have your employees sign a document wherein your employees explicitly agree to accept their wages in bitcoin instead of fiat, you state how many bitcoins they will be paid, you lay out the risks of being paid in bitcoin and they agree to assume the risks and hold you harmless if for some reason bitcoin blows up. There are probably other issues that you should discuss with your lawyer. You need to be very careful when you do something that affects your dealings with your employees. The field of employment law is full of plaintiff lawyer sharks looking for the slightest reason to sue employers.

You could have insurance that replaces the money. If you want to sue someone, I think you could now, but the problem to me lies more with the evidence you need to prove your case, and rather than with concerns over whether a court will consider bitcoin to be "real money".

I think a trade is a trade, whether you do it on an exchange or not. 1099s are reporting requirements imposed on financial institutions (US-based ones, at least). I doubt that Bitstamp or Mt. Gox will send you a 1099 at the end of the year (anybody know?), but the law is concerned with your actions, not the formalities associated it. I trade stocks, and now brokerages are required to include all of your trades on the 1099. Every year there is some mistake on it, but I don't think I am allowed to pretend that the mistake is a fact. 1099s are not dispositive as to whether or not you have made a trade. Your responsibility under the law is to report the truth, and 1099s are supposed to be an aid to the government in determining whether you comply. When a financial institution does not issue a 1099, it makes it harder for the government to know what happened. In that case, whether you report your trades or not is ultimately up to you, and you will have to deal with whatever consequences ensue.
As for your scenario, I don't have much experience with section 988, but 988(e)(2) provides an exception for "personal transactions".
I believe that bitcoin is a currency, and in the absence of further specific guidance from Big Brother, I think all the usual rules apply.

I have an online checking account linked to a stock brokerage account with [Schwab]( (last choice on the page). I never use the brokerage account to trade stocks, but wires will be sent from it. You just transfer money from the checking account into the brokerage account, which goes through immediately, fill out the wire form and fax it or take it to your local Schwab branch like I do. The fee for an international wire is a flat $25. Bitstamp takes 0.1%, minimum $15. Maybe I've been lucky, but all the wires that I initiate in the morning Pacific time hit my Bitstamp account by the next day.

If bitcoin is to be treated like a currency, then 26 USC 988 and 1256 are relevant. Losses and gains from currency trades are ordinary under section 988 or, if section 1256 applies, subject to "60/40" treatment.


You are thinking of the [currency transaction report]( which is triggered by transactions over $10,000 and which gets reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), not the IRS.


You're thinking of [structuring]( which is a technique used in money laundering. If you're a small business, the federal government uses this excuse to [seize your assets and then return only a portion of it back even if no criminal charges are ever filed against you]( The use of [civil forfeiture]( as it is known, has been abused by governments as a way to fill up its coffers, since challenging it is often costly and futile.

In Bitstamp, as any other exchange, if you put in a buy order for 2 bitcoins at $650 and someone is willing to sell 2 at $650 then you will get 2 bitcoins immediately. But you can't just "enter [your] bank details and buy some Bitcoins". You need to transfer enough USD into your Bitstamp account first in order to fund your purchase. In Europe you have something called SEPA and I don't know how long that takes to move money into your Bitstamp account.

I understand your frustration, but there could be a small silver lining for not being able to trade in a very volatile market. As I saw BTC/USD go up yesterday, I very hastily signed up with Coinbase and bought a bunch at $712. Since I will never use Mt. Gox to buy USD, doh! Luckily, the average cost of all my BTC is low enough that I am still ahead, but there is use in having some restraint, whether externally or internally imposed, when things are going crazy.
That said, while I am a little forgiving of Bitstamp given the unusual volume in the past few days and the relative nascence of the company, the problems that I have experienced with them will have me looking at other additional exchanges to see if I can diversify my broker risk.

Kraken is US based, but right now, most US citizens cannot deposit USD into their Kraken account and then exchange USD for BTC. I think Kraken is in the process of complying with the money services business laws of each state, which require applying for a license and keeping a certain amount of securities on deposit with the state. Who knows how long that will take. I know that nonUS citizens are able to use Kraken to exchange their fiat to bitcoin, but the company must have somehow interpreted the law as allowing it to deal in that way.
As for Coinbase, I think that I read somewhere in this subreddit that it does not believe that it is a money services business or else it does not believe that the money transmitter laws apply to it in such a way as to prohibit it from doing what it is doing.

"Use it as you like" seems too broad an interpretation. The only explicit sanction was that you can trade it like a virtual commodity. The notice does not prohibit exchanging bitcoin for goods and services, but at the same time, it does not sanction it either. In fact, I find it troublesome that the government stance is "it is not currency in the true sense. Bitcoin is a specified virtual commodity, it does not have equal legal status with currency, and it cannot and should not be circulated as currency on the market." By your comment, I think you might interpret "currency" as "fiat currency", but it is plausible at this point to interpret "currency" as *any* currency. In other words, one way to read this is that you can trade bitcoin on electronic exchanges, but you can't treat it like a currency for buying stuff.

I would suggest taking stock of all of your assets and determining how you want have your equity distributed, keeping an eye on staying diversified. How much equity do you have in your house, your savings accounts and your stock brokerage/mutual fund accounts, including your 401(k)? Ask yourself how much risk you are willing to take and then allocate accordingly. My own allocation is about 15% in my house, 75% in stocks and corporate bonds, 5% in USD cash and 5% in bitcoin. I would not put all or even most of my equity in bitcoin. I've been dabbling in stocks for a few years now, and I have never seen volatility as I have when looking at bitcoin charts. Having a low percentage allocation in bitcoin means that for me, all the crazy movements are fun and exhilarating, rather than insomnia and anxiety inducing. But at the same time, I am giving up the possibility of becoming an instant USD millionaire. You need to determine the right balance for yourself in view of your assets, liabilities, job stability, desire to have kids, etc.
If I were you, I would not touch your 401(k). Historically, the S&amp;P 500 returns 9% a year, meaning your 401(k) will double every 8 years if you just let it sit there. I suggest maxing out your 401(k) contribution; paying down your wife's student debt as much as possible, unless the interest rate is freakishly low like mine (~2.25%); and putting only your mad money into bitcoin-- money that you could completely lose and not want to kill yourself over it.
