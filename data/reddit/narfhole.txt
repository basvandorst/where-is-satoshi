I don't know, could be seen as censorship.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:28:28
It's like a Blockstream ad.
@_date: 2014-09-25 10:33:48
Might this affect bitcoind?
@_date: 2014-08-21 04:45:07
It jumped 0x13 in 10 minutes?!
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:40:41
Yeah, he's always shown some sort of agenda.
@_date: 2014-09-25 11:19:39
It isn't own citizens.
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:06:45
Can you explain why?
@_date: 2014-01-11 15:19:56
How about we ask open source software devs instead?
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:24:05
The hell is this?
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:25:27
Has BIP 70 actually been implemented? Does this version use CAs for any sort of payment authorization?
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:11:24
3 billion bitcoins, holy shit!
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:59:49
I've always used them, fine registrar.
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:19:46
bitcoind is plenty accessible to the visually impaired.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:04:31
directory.io time!
@_date: 2014-10-09 00:50:00
That's the spirit, show all those who haven't that they're too late to get into Bitcoin. We need even less Bitcoin users!
@_date: 2014-09-25 11:51:18
Yeah... doubt it'd use any shell commands over system calls.
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:04:05
How do you avoid OOMs?
@_date: 2014-08-24 06:55:01
Seeding this and hosting a node makes good use of my hardware/connection.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:02:44
Your domain makes me think Bitcoin mechanical turk.
@_date: 2014-05-21 15:32:30
i2p, Freenet? People doing what they want with content, laws be damned.
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:30:45
I already run a full node on one of my Scryptcoin mining boxes. Trying to run a full node on a 1GB RAM Xen VPS but the swapping isn't helping. :/
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:27:53
Bitcoin is a hedging instrument in the grand scheme of things if you're investing in it. What were you hedging against?
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:29:48
Bitcoins'd in, wire transfer'd out. Wire transfer may be more expensive, but I didn't have to submit photo ID etc. I approve of this exchange.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:24:49
I'm going to spend it all on iHookers and iBlow!
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:55:08
Are those the features that rely on a CA?
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:44:48
https, even: 
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:35:04
If it's only a client feature and doesn't change anything with bitcoind, I don't mind it.
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:03:57
So, where can I buy assault weapons with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:52:03
It isn't users.
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:22:56
I know Perl!
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:44:11
With the CAD falling against the USD, this is of use.
@_date: 2015-05-26 12:23:22
Humans will always pursue what they desire, nice to see Bitcoin aiding in freedom of expression.
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:37:34
If you run a node, anyone can get your IP address. Is it that surprising?
@_date: 2015-08-01 04:09:50
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:12:48
Nice detective work, highlights even more schisms within the devs.  
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:16:08
That's not how it works...
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:47:49
Only if a transaction you make was included in a &gt;1MB block.
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:28:02
But, Core isn't currently enjoying a wave of user support behind the block size issue. People seem to either not know of or don't consider those to be bugs.
But, someone should fix them.
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:29:04
How do you represent a settlement system in graphic form...
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:13:28
You don't think all nodes mine blocks equally, do you? It's 75% of mined blocks with a certain version number, not 75% of all nodes...
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:05:15
Well, in that situation you didn't lose your coins, coins sent to you never arrived. I'm not seeing how there's any fear tactics associated with choosing to use a non-core Bitcoin node that does what you want it to do.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:42:34
That's great, give me the registration invite.
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:52:35
He's waiting for a point where Bitcoin is no longer aligned with his vision for it. At that time, if it occurs, he can flood the market and destroy its value to miners/venture capitalists.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:08:04
Where'd you get the ~4300 number from?
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:03:45
Give me the 2 BTC first and I'll tell you what it is, you may not like the answer, though. ;)
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:57:14
I don't understand what you mean...
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:01:42
Generally when it comes to OSS, if you have bugs/issues you submit a report/patch.
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:23:36
If someone does indeed submit patches, or at least commentary, more review could occur.
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:25:45
Logic about technological progress like having exponentially more storage/transistors/bandwidth than you had 10 years ago isn't going to stop certain people/entities from profiting off the blockchain the way they see fit.
@_date: 2015-08-10 11:02:43
I'd rather see the block size increase, so I'll never be running this on any of my boxes.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:09:44
Was this Streisand Effect situation intended? Does the pro-censorship mod actually want XT to succeed?
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:45:25
You're not discussing the privacy of IP addresses? then what are you discussing?
@_date: 2015-07-05 04:39:41
Might want to use https on the voat link.
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:00:36
Yeah, they're call altcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:32:17
Why are you so bitter? it's a great buying opportunity.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:34:54
If your convinced of such a doom and gloom situation without looking at the code changes, don't bother submitting patches after all.
@_date: 2015-07-25 03:19:39
Not all people would see it that way, the fact that we continue to receive unsolicited commercial email shows there are people who buy products/services from them.
With a cost attached to sending email, the pitches in the email would have to be more effective and the business model of the sender would have to be more solid.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:53:35
 has worked fine for me in the past.
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:22:11
Submit some patches for those issues.
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:24:38
Node sponsorship, anyone? Vote with what you run, mine and sponsor!
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:56:35
Seems like tor users would have a lower priority, rather than an outright blacklisting.
@_date: 2015-07-25 01:36:40
I can understand it being spam if there's no cost, but with a fee it's just a use of the blockchain some people don't like.
It's like if email required proof of work, some people may not like getting promotional emails, but there'd be a cost in computer hardware/electricity that someone other than the creator of the email profits from.
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:08:47
Or, you could link to them saying they intend to include code in an open source project that would no longer make it open source.
@_date: 2012-03-22 19:35:28
Wait, was 16 the one supported by that guy used his pool to put Christian nuttery in the blockchain?
@_date: 2011-06-24 14:47:19
As long as you're in the black, it's fine.
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:47:58
Should help with that.
@_date: 2011-06-11 05:55:30
A lot of putty windows works for me.
@_date: 2011-05-09 00:30:49
No AIDS pool.
@_date: 2011-07-10 22:57:40
Your username, I get it...
@_date: 2011-06-29 20:16:33
GST on your commission, or each trade's value?
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:53:06
I'm sure you'll get an answer any minute now pointing to the exact line of code that's suspect. /s

Autism is the new retardation.
@_date: 2015-02-24 03:36:11
Haven't tried them,  has worked for me in the past.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:50:08
Bitcoin will have to be perceived as much less risky than it is now before women get on board en masse.
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:17:55
Alright, sent an email with an issue. Should I expect a response soon, or only if I'm to get a reward?
@_date: 2013-08-22 20:14:17
Ron Paul only appeals to a small amount of Americans. Wouldn't it be better to try to court a more worldly booster for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:35:22
What is "bbqcoin"?
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:47:31
What an unfortunate pidgeonholing of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:32:22
Got me mining somewhat again!
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:48:02

    Bad credentials.
Trying the password reset link and entering new password:

I'd certainly not use it until it's open sourced.
