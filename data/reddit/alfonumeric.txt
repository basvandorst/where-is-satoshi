in science we move forward by proposing better and better theories that can fit the facts on the ground.
this particular view is called the alfonumeric theory of the evolution of bitcoin over the first 121 months....
and will be superceded by more realistic theories as we become more able to perceive the reality behind the scenes.

i was trying to inject some light-hearted banter to show how contentious and serious scaling can be !

i prefer the chi because of the appropriate associations 
everything is made of 3 aspects:
aspect  = Sat (Sanskrit: सत्) is a Sanskrit word meaning "the true soul essence and that "which is unchangeable" of an entity, species or existence
aspect  = o = omicron = sub-atomic matter
aspect  = chi the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet ( Χ, χ ), transliterated as ‘kh’ or ‘ch’.  22 codons for 20 amino acids
chi=qi chinese = universal energy force
a worthy name-meaning for the inventors of blockchain tech

=sat ...Sanskrit word meaning "the true essence and that "which is unchangeable" 
=omicron ... Greek small o": Όμικρον, o mikron, micron meaning 'small' in contrast to omega) is the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 70. This letter is derived from the Phoenician letter ayin 
=chi[shi] : chinese for energy
=satochi = energetic matter as micro-payments

see  for calculation
peak hashrate = 6878, low hashrate = 5878
1000/5878 = 17%     so total = 117%
not all the drop of hashpower will flip but if mcpool = 500 approx
these figures will even out

i'm looking at the uptake so far on bitcoin...
600,000 addresses have have got at least 1 bitcoin
i guess that translates into - about 100,000 people take bitcoin seriously ....
lets take the people with bank accounts as 1 billion
so that translates into 1 person in 10,000 who have more than dabbled with this new technology..
sounds about right if we take a sample of our friends and neighbors
so let's get 3 productive shows on the road running on full gas, rather than burning up so much gas/satochis arguing over which philosophy is best.
let the market decide which philosophy to go with and that will free up the 3 sets of bitcoin-philosophers to refine their own theories rather than shooting down the other 2 theories.
