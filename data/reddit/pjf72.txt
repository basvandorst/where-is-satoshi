Ok, politics and education. 2 different things. Sometimes, rarely, they meet.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:40:04
Yes, which one?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:24:33
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:08:17
Yeah it's both. Originally it was a misspelling when someone was drunk And made a thread online. It got changed to mean hold on for dear life. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:40:39
Oh yeah, there's always one smart arse, who knows everything but in reality knows absolutely fuck all and drives round in a 28 year old honda accord because he thinks it's a collector's item and paid more for it than I just lost today on crypto, and combs his hair on Monday and leaves it for the rest of the week, and looks like a bird's fuckin nest for the rest of the week!

Yes, and one country banning it will only make the competition better - as the neighbouring countries will provide services to the banned countries. They will have a huge financial incentive.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:25:02
The problem you have is that, if anyone else find themselves in Ross's position, they may as well go on a killing spree, because they're getting locked up forever anyway. If they'd charged him for plotting to murder, then they could've used that as another reason for 50 plus years. It's the same reason rape is a lesser crime than murder, because all rape victims would be killed.

It was BBC summary of a football match the other night/day whenever it was. But they had to get a dig in at Bitcoin.
Btw, I've only just got the pun about 'sterling'...but still, it was still a dig.

We just need a better system of transfer than what is available now. Why do we need a key phrase? Why cant we have something else that's more convenient?
We already have exchanges involved which compromise decentralisation. I dont see why the evolution of exchanges couldnt address the problems you've so well demonstrated.

Ooh, what happened before? All crypto took a huge dip of about 20% then back up in 10 minutes?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:07:56
Yes, but 99% of them would've sold at the first opportunity for a decent profit. If you bought for $1, and then 2 years later they are $100 - most people are going to sell. Or some aren't going to keep them secure and get them stolen or lost. Very few bought at £1 and still have them now, at $10k+.

Coinbase support is in my experience around 2-3 days
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:14:56
Are we seriously thinking of holding these things for 50 years? No. Didn't think so. What's inflation got to do with anything, over 5 years?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:36:38
Once the general population gets into this, it'll go off like world war 3. We've only scratched the surface of this crypto stuff. I'd say &lt;5% in UK have bought any crypto. BUT if they are to get into it, it needs to made simpler. Some people struggle with opening bank accounts, emails and tax returns - this is WAAY harder. That's what will hold it back.

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:32:28
That's exactly what happened to me. I read a little about it, bought a book that I've started reading, but I decided I needed to get into it ASAP, so bought £1000 worth, and now I read about bitcoin all day long. It's really got me motivated to learn, knowing I've got 1000 sitting on it.

Oh, of course, the gains from drugs etc. What about anyone else cashing them?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:31:13
I don't know, ya know. It's just using a bank that isn't in your country. You don't have to live there to use their bank or financial services or bitcoin exchange. Transferring bitcoin to a U.S. account obviously would be tax declarable. Definitely gets a bit complicated, legally though.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:45:08
People who say this completely ignore how good it feels to have 4 million in the bank and a sweet house and car.

Ok, total newb here, I have approx. £1000 worth of bitcoin in Coinbase. Is this secure? Or do I need to place it somewhere else? Do I need pass keys or something to transfer them? Or do I just need to log in?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:14:00
Man, this thing has gone up and down 40-50% in like 2 hours, then climbed back in half a day. It's kinda normal, but a bit excessive. As soon as it drops a big percentage, people start buying again (buy low sell high obv).
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:41:46
Yeah. And if he knew about money then he'd mortgage to the hilt, and invest his money so that it covers the mortgage payments and then some.
If you suddenly won the lottery, you wouldn't go out and buy cars and houses with cash, you'd mortgage or loan everything. Then you'd live on the interest or investment dividend.

@_date: 2017-12-01 07:40:09
No, of course. I mean trade in bit coin. It's not an easy thing to do, by most people's standards. I don't know of a single other person who has bought any. This thing is still for the hitech.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:37:53

Btw, i love your optimism. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:03:13
Ooh. I like it!
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:59:38
Yeah but only when you sell it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:44:20
It ain't a Lambo, so, no.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:57:48
I don't think we've seen anywhere near hype, certainly not in the uk. Hardly anyone has bought any, except a few clued up techies.
Once the general population start to buy, invest and spend bitcoin, that's when the hype will explode. That's probably 2 years away minimum. I predict steady gains til then, then an explosion.
The biggest issue that bitcoin has is the technical hoops that investors Are required to jump through to purchase coins - most people arent going to be able to do that. Loads of people don't even have email accounts. Obviously they're are at one end of the scale, but there's a large proportion of the population approaching that end of the spectrum who won't be able to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:35:05
Yeah. I don't know any either. I was being generous with the 5t, it's probably 1%.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:19:05

A house doubles on average every 10-15 years. You won't get 6-9x in 25 years.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:20:59
Or they could simply ban bitcoin from the internet...
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:35:44
Yeah but why would that stop someone from putting a few million into it? Isn't that nearly every millionaire does anyway? Or do they have special bank accounts for the rich (like in UK Coutt's etc)? I which case, this wouldn't matter either.
I would've thought there would be situation with large deposits into accounts being suspicious and would alert banks to money laundering purposes etc.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:09:10
I bought at 10k. I now own 0.115 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:22:56
There's a surprising number of people with serious disposable income who wouldn't think twice about throwing 1k plus at a growing stock like bitcoin. The problem is partly fees and partly difficulty and delays getting into the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:33:52
Man, people were arguing this ad infinitum the other day - where were you then!?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:03:23
You don't make money in the RE or banking world without fairly substantial sums of money to start with. Crypto were penny shares, effectively. Now they're 5 digit units.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:54:39
So, if i were to buy a house with my bitcoin, how would they tax me on that? Just when i come to sell the house?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:46:30
Ah, thanks for that. I still have my recovery words written down, phew!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:49:13
Yeah, definitely. They're certainly less informed than your average stock investor, as a whole, certainly not this community. Or perhaps we're more educated in the technology of crypto, rather than the investment mechanism. But we're certainly getting there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:59

My purpose would be to travel round the world playing the best golf courses, staying in the best hotels...
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:33:39
How would you keep check of how much profit/loss you will make? As you've bought at different rates/values, it'll be difficult right?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:07:12
In UK it's definitely not that way. You only pay tax on cash release or income from the sale. It's called capital gains tax.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:23:36
Oh i see, of course
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:35:33

@_date: 2017-12-05 21:25:38
I think the best thing to do for those with fairly large profits from this (say, $100k+), would be to perhaps take 10% of it and actually SPEND it, get the currency MOVING. You won't have lost anything because you've bought items with the 10%. And the other 90% will more likely go up MORE due to this (if most people did something similar). The MARKET for bitcoin as CURRENCY needs to be stimulated - supply and demand.

I'm just saying, it isn't stable. There's no argument when you look at the facts.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:45:40
Btw, if i have a wallet, how does the transaction transfer if it's offline or wherever?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:04:26
Yes, and i think the crypto market is full of these types of investors, much more than your average stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:31:16
Well that may be true for US but it's nothing like that in UK. Earliest record i could find is 1952, average price was £1891. So, property price scales up very very quickly, even with inflationary corrections.
Btw, how come house prices were so high back then? How did people afford them? What was average wage back then?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:25:02
My bank takes several hours to transfer money.

Nah mate, most people struggle with computer use. There's a very steep learning curve to buy bitcoin and most people aren't going to struggle through that, unless they get help with it.
As it stands, this is out of the reach of millions in this country, at least. How can someone manage to buy bitcoin with confidence, when they haven't the tech savvy to set up an email account? These people aren't in the minority either.
It's going to have to be made simpler, maybe by integration with standard banks, or by active help with the transactions.

@_date: 2017-12-03 22:05:52
Passwords, e wallets, choice of coin exchanges, setting up coin exchanges and wallets, transferring money internationally, And that's just a few things off the top of my head. 
Plus, even getting an IBAN and BIC number requires me to travel to a 'local' branch to get told what it is. Most people can't be arsed with any of that. It's far from 'easy'.

If the whole world started using bitcoin, each person would have about $20 worth, on average (probably much less due to lost coins etc), so you'd be pretty wealthy over the average person.

Hey, I'm only putting an opposing view out there. R/bitcoin has been wanking itself silly about lightning this lightning that, yet the real issue is getting your money round exchanges.
If you want to bury your head in the sand then that's fine, but it's a huge problem. Adoption won't occur very quickly without these things sorted out. The whole of Europe has to use coinbase, and it no doubt puts people off.
Why should i have to learn the tech? Don't be such a condescending little gobshite...you don't know how spunk forms, doesn't stop you wanking gallons of it a day hahaha

That's an investment, too, unfortunately. House prices have quadrupled (before inflation) since 1950. Average house price in 1952 was about 2k. Average now is 200k, roughly. Inflation is 25x and house price is 4x over that period.

So, everything has been going up in price....but wages havent? Oookkaay....I'm sure in some realm of alternative economics that that's true, but clearly it's impossible in this reality.
Average wage in 1970 was about £30/week. Average wage now is £600/week. That's all inflation, effectively.
It doesn't matter what you're spending it on, wages are wages.

@_date: 2019-06-07 17:38:10
I agree mostly with what you say, apart from a couple of things.
They can't destroy something that isn't tangible...unless they have the keys....no way of knowing.
Secondly, owning crypto wouldn't be illegal, but trading it would. Basically, decrminalising crypto (possession is ok, trading it or mining it wouldn't be ok). Because, if you already own crypto, how would you get rid of it? Burn your keys? How do you prove that? They'd just have to draw the line and say, possession isn't illegal, but selling it, using etc is illegal.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:45:11

Yes. That's digital fiat. But 40 years ago or whatever we were using mostly cash (notes and coins). The point is that we are transitioning to a fully digital system, which opens the door even ore for btc etc.

That aint gonna happen because its illegal to say you can cure cancer.

@_date: 2019-02-13 19:27:43
Weren't they encouraged by the police officer? I think you're twisting the truth a touch here
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:23:21
And you don't think they will rocket the price up? This is the only barrier to it happening.... User friendliness.
When the first home computers arrived in around 1980, they were very user unfriendly... But that changed after a while. When the Internet first started, it was slow and it was only really useful for email. That eventually changed.
Bitcoin is just waiting for a killer interface, to go along with the killer apps. Then it will be off like a rocket.

@_date: 2019-12-30 21:09:52

It's the best preforming asset over the last 10 years, and it could be for the next 10 years.
@_date: 2019-12-30 16:08:12
Yes. However, we've only ever seen tiny (on a global scale) amounts of money invested in BTC. Once that changes, there will be huge upturn. And then the model will revert to what it's displaying now - slow, steady growth.
@_date: 2019-06-07 21:47:52
God you're dim. How do you send cash to an exchange? Fuckin thick cunt
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:39:10
You'd need an exchange for that...but they're banned.
@_date: 2019-12-28 12:37:30
I mean that they are paying their larger electric bills... And getting bitcoin in return. It doesn't matter that they might only be just breaking even.... They have bitcoin now. Which will grow.

What if one of the sharers dies?
@_date: 2019-12-30 14:48:46
0.15% of the world's economy is in BTC.....imagine if just  10% was in it? Or 50%?
Also, that chart has a logorithmic scale. That's why it's tailing off.
@_date: 2019-12-31 12:12:06
But it does.
@_date: 2019-12-28 00:19:30
Or they are monetising their electric bills.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:14:19
How? Surely they can ban credit card to bitcoin etc. Or bank transfers?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:41:08
So...how do we find out the 100 day moving average?
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:00:19
Yeah, but it's shit that you cant buy weed in a shop (in UK at least). It's a much poorer experience, it being illegal. I wouldn't be able to buy BTC if it was cash only. Wouldn't be able to trust anyone.
So, it's like trying to plug a leak - you plug one, then another appears, and so on?
@_date: 2019-12-30 15:39:42
Yes. I agree. The data and analysis in this article is great.....assuming everything stays the same, in terms of attracting money into BTC. However, this hasnt even become mainstream yet....but when it does, it will jump massively. It WILL jump massively, but only when the steep learning curve to buy BTC is reduced. Once that happens, and your Granny can buy bitcoin in the local post office, or pay the gas bill with it, it will grow like weve never seen growth like it before.
Only 0.15% of world economy is in BTC. It doesn't take a genius to realise that even 10% of the worlds economy would be a huge increase...leading to 1 satoshi equal to 1 cent (or dollar?).
@_date: 2019-12-30 16:37:39
Ok. How much money is in gold? $8T\~. So, thats about 10% of the worlds economy. I'd suggest that BTC can at least reach this level....based on it's killer app - a store of value. BUT we havent factored in the other killer app - it's use as a currency. Which will replace some of FIAT, perhaps 10% in the next 5-10 years.
I think BTC will replace a large proportion of bricks and mortar investments, as most people are priced out of the housing market at the moment. Even if it's used as a way to save and accumulate interest on your deposit savings.
Also, institutional investment hasnt really taken off yet - as it's seen as a risky investment. But once it starts to grow again, we should see people hedging against the dollar and the banking system.
We are at the tip of the iceberg, in terms of investment channels pouring into bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-03-01 19:39:01
Depends which part of the 90s - the first 2 years, there are more crypto. The last 7 or 8, there is more www, but it still took many years for it to become an everyday thing.

@_date: 2018-03-12 22:52:58
I've never seen a fixed rate of more than 5 years. No wonder you can't find any!
They are lending it to us because they use my money as leverage, to lend to others At a higher rate. I give them 20k, on a 100k house. They can then lend out 180k using my 20k as leverage...they earn a lot more on that money than it costs them lending me 80k.

If everyone got paid in btc, it wouldn't matter what the value of btc was in relation to usd. 1btc would still equal 1btc, regardless of the usd pairing.

So, does he mean that we go on a climb as we approach the halving?

@_date: 2018-03-08 22:08:36
I think I see what you mean there. I never really understood what deflationary really meant, but when you have a finite amount of it and then everyone wants to INCREASE their share, it must automatically make it more valuable (due to demand). I like it.

Well, you certainly can't get free porn by opening a wallet. But you can earn big sums of money. Both things could be equally as influential in the growth.

It's not catching on faster because it's so difficult to get into buying it. The barriers to entry are too high for your average person.

I don't think that would be allowed, FSA etc. But i do think people will be advertising their services to help people set up and buy crypto, almost by proxy. I've actually already had some contact with a company doing exactly that, and there will surely be many that copy that. It's gonna be huuuuge.

Halving in 2020? When exactly?

It only happens in BTC...and it's only happened 3 or 4 times in its history. I think someone has been having vivid dreams.

If i was rich, i would keep my money earning high rates of interest, and all my spending would be done by borrowing (mortgages, credit cards, loans etc). This will make me even more wealthy. How does this help everyone?
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:43:41
You know what he meant. Inflation means growth
@_date: 2019-01-05 17:45:04
Ok, sorry
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:01:13
I think this applies to many fields. The problem is that many graduates leave university and think that they will be given decent jobs. When, in reality, they DO get decent jobs BUT their learning has only just begun. A degree prepares you for a life of learning - and if you don't make the effort to learn, you will not progress as well as you'd hoped. If you don't like learning or struggle with academia, then a degree is probably wasted to some extent on you. You have been employed on your ability to learn - and your employer wants you to learn something new, usually.
Don't get me wrong, but learning or academia is extremely hard - it's no walk in the park, getting a degree. Good luck to those that persevere.

Yes, and the population has increased loads, so that means less land for everyone.

First line - I'm not sure that would equal a medium risk. 
Great effort though, 95% correct id estimate.

They definitely will use bitcoin for purchases.

Can you elaborate a little for us please?
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:14:46
I mentioned this a few weeks ago. Perhaps it's so that if btc reaches like $1m, then we still have divisions that go low enough for 1 cent. If we move the decimal point to the right, then it reduces the divisibility of it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:27:28
Great post. Love it
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:24:44
How did you hide your paper wallet? Couldn't they seize the contents of your wallet?
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:10:51
When they say deflationary, don't they mean that the numbers of them don't increase. Like fiat is inflationary because they keep printing shedloads of it? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:33:46
Clever. I like it. Id be shitting myself if i forgot which ones though
@_date: 2018-11-01 10:18:20
no, exact opposite
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:19:17
He means interest
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:12:08
He meant potential for growth, obviously. And inflation, in the strictest sense of the word, means growth.
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:24:55
Er, no

Oh, you old FUDdy duddy you!
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:00:53
people did say that the internet wouldn't take off though. And later on we had the dot.com bubble. I think the reasoning is definitely applicable, if not entirely sound.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:07:26
That logic is flawed
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:28:46
No. You can definitely get mortgage rates of around 1-1.3%...last time i looked about 3 months ago.
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:32:25
Great post, thanks for taking the time to research that too.
So, he sells 6000BTC 3 times on same day and same time at approx. $10k each. That totals $180M. Is that enough to make the market shift considerably? Or is it auto trading that gets triggered?

No shit. Been like this since the ATH. So much FUD. Blatantly obvious to anyone who's been reading this sub (and others) for a decent amount of time. I don't bother reading it much anymore, the odd article aside.
Mind you, there are plenty of people out there who are massively negative and bitter, and can't stand anyone to have success. I see it every day in the workplace. It's a personality disorder (btw, I'd like to know which it is, if anyone is into the behavioral sciences).

Maybe. I leaning towards a personality disorder though. Not everyone who is unsuccessful etc has this trait.
Look at Piers Morgan....very successful guy, but a massive pessimist. He loves being a doom monger

yeah, you're right, he didn't.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:32:23

His success doesn't really get affected by the disorder...he can still function normally. Hitler obviously had massive personality disorders and it didn't stop him being the head of a country...that's massively successful, despite his ulterior motives.

@_date: 2019-05-28 20:21:53
That's a great thought. I've got a modest sum that is sitting in an account earning me about £30 per year. Could be getting 10 or 100 times that in BTC.

@_date: 2019-05-18 22:44:17
You said bitcoin is only a store of value. Why would i agree with that?
Bitcoin is a store of value and also a currency, much like gold used to be (as part of the banking system, which it still is but nothing like it once was).
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:33:24
You transfer all your fiat to a bitcoin card. Then you simply use the card just like a credit or debit card. 
The added bonus is that fiat systems will completely collapse if everybody did that.

@_date: 2018-12-16 13:02:20
Huh? Did bitcoin start 12 months ago? No, of course not. You still with me? Right, good boy. Anyone who invested before that is likely still in profit, ya get me now bruv? Thinking outside the box and all that shizzle, who'd have thought bitcoin was lower than what it is today or 12 months ago. Amazing hey?
