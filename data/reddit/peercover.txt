what makes you say that? last time I checked we are still doing BTC withdrawals when the rest of the exchanges are bankrupt. quite rude and uneducated.

Ethereum will not have the assets at the time of the pre-sale. This way you have two bodies that share liability.

make the process cheaper and faster. provisional patents are cheap but full patents are expensive and cost prohibitive - years of investment can easily be lost due to prohibitively high filing costs and inability of inventors to write up inventions in the correct format. the real inventors can easily be drowned out by good marketing and publicity of ripoffs which then secure funding over the real inventor, essentially allowing for IP theft. inventors now face the "troll" bias perpetuated by the media exaggeration of a few bad eggs in the system. with a public ledger, people can submit ideas, concepts, and demonstrate reduction to practice in real time in an undeniable, timestamped, infallible way by submitting real code, diagrams, and figures real experts can evaluate publicly. essentially inventors can create paper trails and provenance of ideas and inventions. also, semi-autonomous structures allow for the easy public licensing and sale of patents which can essentially become virtual assets in contract systems.

we simply place a correction multiplier on withdraws.

no one in their right mind is going to open a randomly hosted and labeled zip.

there is no doubt - quite simple. if ethereum decides to dole out 5000 ether for 1 BTC, any ether withdrawn we multiply by 5. this is all coded and definite.

what happens when your locked in address is compromised and your withdrawals are in transit?
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:21:21
they pretend no funds were lost but the reality is they "double sent" tons of funds because they thought they were smart with redundancy and resubmission code that used transaction ids. they may be able to raise more money and survive but they are in deep shit.

Branding yourself as a coder-congressman is not the way to do it. You will hit brick walls when attempting to influence policy in any other area and will face typecasting.

No, only 750,000 BTC belonged to users of the exchange. 100,000 "belonged" to Mt. Gox. 200,000 BTC / 750,000 BTC = 26.67%

MIT grads are evil and manipulative. Benjy Thomas, a MIT grad convinced us to go with a Google wallet distribution and then had Google wallet freeze 10gs of our funds for &gt;6 months so MIT students could "catch up." We have had bad experiences with MIT grads across the board.

What other protocol with a good trading community allows you to actually issue assets for a currency you are promised in a future time from a fundraiser?

yeah that is how it is now. you don't have to use XRP if you don't want to  but it is interchangeable with IOUs and trustless. the main attraction of ripple right now is colored coins and decentralized trading which enables plug and play apps in which you always control your funds or at least control the debt the gateways owe you.
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:36:20
XRP is just like BTC in function. IOUs allow you to trade on a decentralized network - better than centralized exchanges and helps solve the GOX problem. In ripple applications your wallet holds all your currencies to trade with. You send IOUs back to gateways to withdraw which is as simple as placing your withdraw address in the send form - this is called a "bridge."

this is all a psychological lie to tie any tumblr user using this theme to "scam." everything you read here is a lie. you are being manipulated.

they need to launch and demonstrate market traction prior to soliciting funding. shifting the fees a product like iTunes would take to P2P hosters is a good idea. they have to demonstrate they can 1) reduce fees for musicians to distribute music without disrupting contracts with established platforms and/or 2) increase distribution and virility of content by fostering a P2P community around tracks - this requires social features
