It would seem to describe much of the Federal constabulary and prosecutorial arms of government:
conspire, v.:
*1. Make secret plans jointly to commit an unlawful or harmful act.*
*2. (of events or circumstances) Seem to be working together to bring about a particular result, typically to someone's detriment.*

Perhaps they're getting a bigger payoff elsewhere for not taking bitcoins.

Like Tor?
Quit shilling for the EFF. They're controlled opposition. They're not on our side.

That's simple human cooperation, the other side of taxes which are coercive by nature.

Take your apologia for a pack of whores to the same.

Would the government you're thinking of be anything like the government in the US now? 
If so, perhaps you might wish to rethink your statement.

The EFF being afraid of legalities isn't a well thought out reason. It's one of the reasons they were founded.
The EFF doesn't want to offend their larger, more established funders that might have a problem with Bitcoin.

No. It makes the EFF look bad for ignoring multiple questions about a topic that's supposed to be in their purview.

The EFF understands Bitcoin. I don't buy the legal case angle. They sued the CIA, the DoJ and the DoD. They're not afraid of controversy. 
The EFF is afraid of looking "extreme". They're now a middle of the road, entrenched DC think tank funded by serious players. [In their last released report]( they list the Open Society Institute as one of their foundational funders. The Open Society Institute is a creation of George Soros. I can't imagine that he's a fan of Bitcoin. 
The EFF won't take Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a threat to their big funders. They don't want to lose their meal ticket by actually supporting the "electronic frontier".
Another way to describe it: The EFF are a bunch of whores.

Though a longer term hedge, don't forget to get some copper too. It's dirt cheap now.

Bitcoin isn't an issue. It has no legal status.


Considering that the EFF was started because a larger entity, the US government, was conspiring against Steve Jackson games, that's a mighty odd angle to take.

I'm amazed at the number of people that WANT to pay taxes, just begging to be taxed.
It's a little sad, to be honest.
@_date: 2013-01-20 09:36:48


"Tax me, please!" is about as moronic as it gets.
@_date: 2013-01-19 20:45:21
Bitcoins and taxes?
@_date: 2013-01-20 05:32:46


It would be were it a free country.
I'll be staying. It's my home and all.

Thank you! My first btc tip!
The EFF is controlled opposition, imo.
@_date: 2013-01-20 05:43:24
I look forward to the day when the State goes begging. ; )
@_date: 2013-01-20 05:17:09
I'm happy to pay for roads. I can take of myself otherwise, thanks.
