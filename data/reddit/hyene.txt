I have this problem ALL THE TIME, it's so frustrating:
" “I even say, ‘I’ll do the work. Just give me the go ahead and I’ll do it myself,’ ” she says. “But they won’t, and so the system stays less efficient.”"

weird. i had a job delivering the Montreal Gazette from door to door when i was about 10 years old, still in elementary school. i also had to go around every week calculating and collecting payment for the paper. i wasn't forced into working, i had to BEG my parents to get a job so i could save up money for my own projects and toys. it was perfectly age appropriate for a 3rd grade middle class Canadian girl to have a job that involved handling money. In grade 6 I was selling candy for profit. in grade 8 we were discussing world politics, history, socioeconomics, as well as more sensitive topics like teen pregnancy, safe sex, and abortion. in grade 10 in high school i was studying accounting and civil law. i see no reason why a paper on bitcoin economics is an inappropriate topic for an 8th grade student.
Your cyber school is woefully out of touch with grade 8 socioeconomics, clearly.
*** all that said, if you are required to be 18 years old to open a bitcoin account or any other accounts required to trade bitcoin, then the topic is indeed age inappropriate.

family is such a nebulous term

When I was a kid, I bit my principal. And my teachers. And the janitor. As such, they tended to comply with my demands.
edit: i still bite

None of the companies I have worked for have ever had a problem hiring creative employees. The problem is many people who call themselves "creative" tend to be incredibly "incompetent". I've worked with so-called "creative" employees before who were not capable of performing simple tasks. We're talking licking and stuffing envelopes and filing alphabetically type simple tasks.
There's creative, and then there's incompetent. Employers LOVE competent, creative people because they tend to know how to troubleshoot conflicts and problems in the office. Printer broken down? No need to call an expensive repairman or computer tech, Creative Employee will figure it out before they even arrive. The problem with competent, creative employees is that they rise to the top rather quickly and strike out of their own. So while they're a gift to have in the workplace they don't usually stick around for longer than 2-5 yrs.
But so what. A well managed office keeps things fresh. So does a healthy turnover.
