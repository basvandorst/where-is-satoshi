Would recomend you to check out Pockebit. Having all the perks of modern walets, it's also simple, intuitiv and really handy. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:26:57
Fair enough :) The idea was a chart going up.
@_date: 2019-03-22 12:50:00
Ledger\\CoolWallet\\Pockebit\\Trezor? 
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:13:55
Sounds reasonable for someone who needs the next level of security

| Owns a crypto wallet (or otherwise it's not really him who uses bitcoin)
@_date: 2019-03-24 03:44:50
Would recommend to consider owning a personal wallet. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:25:33
Besides that it's obviously not a good idea to share the access to the wallet, in your case Copay and a multisig sounds the most reasonable decision. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 12:48:29
Congrats! Have you already chosen your first wallet?
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:29:45
Reached out for a comments from everyone with hardware wallets, each one had the same words to say, "Worth it" ;)
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:26:37
Would recomend you to check out Pockebit. It's simple, intuitive, really handy: the form of the device reminds of the modern smartphones (also has a big touchscreen which will show you the full address for validation), and it can be considered as the most secure device (has all the safety perks of the latest hardware wallets plus it's non-contact).
@_date: 2019-03-06 07:59:18
True, if one considers the risk worth taking.
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:11:07
Hello, first of all get to know how to secure your crypto. To know what is Bitcoin is one thing, to know how to hodl it - another. So dig into secure issues, read about different wallets, know the difference between hot and cold ones. Check out trezor, ledger, pockebit etc.
@_date: 2019-03-05 09:44:47
Ironically, to truly own Bitcoin you need only one thing (even when not understanding it) - hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:35:11
Good idea, thanks for the bot!
@_date: 2019-02-19 13:14:32
Do you mean like NFC for digital wallet?
@_date: 2019-02-04 16:57:39
Next we use cold storages, so no lost crypto anymore ;)
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:25:55
Yup, quite a good model indeed. Would recomend to check Vault or Pockebit, as the most protected devices on the market.
@_date: 2019-02-02 19:44:48
Seems like it, and personal node in that case sounds absolutely reasonable too.
Regarding security\privacy, though, it’s good to have both, right? When privacy relates to any rights you have to control your personal information and how it’s used, security is to how your personal information is protected. Just be sure you've got both covered.
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:31:50
Looks awesome, would add a crypto wallet though
@_date: 2019-02-27 09:24:49
 "Not having a hardware wallet is not a good idea."   
\- Pockebit and common sense. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:19:03
Will see how it goes ;)
@_date: 2019-02-04 09:34:05
Could use a cold wallet as a shield as well) 
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:37:20
Would recommend getting a real cold wallet though, so you'd have less chances of having a wallet compromised in principle.

You can add a former Goldman Sachs partner with: “Bitcoin is going to be digital gold, a place where you have sovereign money &lt;...&gt;. Sovereignty costs a lot, it should.” 
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:18:22
Of course, ''contactless" doesn't mean that there are no ways to connect to the device. Basically the idea is that the less ways there are to connect to the wallet, the safer the device is.   
Regarding the approach with an air gapped computer - yes, can't disagree that this is one of the most solid ways to be certain in the overall safety of your transactions. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:42:55
So in ten years now they will say: ah, it was that guy who bough a pizza for 0,002 BTC. What an embezzler! =D
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:37:44
Fair enough) Fingers crossed\*
@_date: 2019-02-19 12:44:02
And if it's necesarry to connect a wallet, what communication type would you choose: wireless or cable? 
@_date: 2019-02-22 08:53:11
Well, whoever owns the early BTC doesn't need a Nobel prize really. With BTC going from $0,06 to $3,936... What is Nobel prize worth in crypto today?
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:17:13
Do or don't sell, just please, keep your saving cold, use digital wallets.
@_date: 2019-02-02 15:39:15
Hello, won't advise you a wallet with a PC connection, as the chances of being compromised are higher. Would check the market for more safety solutions (e.g. contactless Pockebit - [
@_date: 2019-02-02 15:32:39
A nicely designed hardware wallet will be better... but sometimes a simple jar works just fine too ;)
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:07:55
Was thinking the same about Nokia 3310. Checked, still working =D
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:26:06
Would it be right to address the bearish periods as the "cold ones" (meaning those times, when you ought to keep your crypto cold)?
@_date: 2019-02-02 15:47:54
Hello, unfortunately the idea sounds impossible... still, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't try other opportunities. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:08:00
A good perspetive to think about BTC! 
@_date: 2019-02-27 09:28:53
Any wallet with internet connection is hot, so taking into consideration that smartphone without internet connection is, well, just a phone, it would be a better idea to get a real digital wallet, and use your smartphone with internet instead. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:04:15
 Any keyboards with digital wallets yet (instead of ����)? 
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:36:56
Well, speaking about the safety issue first: when the hardware wallet is connected to a computer, it can be compromised (meaning there is always such possibility).
Second, do remember about the solid pass you should create (after all, if someone comes into possession of the device, it might be the problem too).
Btw, here is a quite good item on wallets vulnerabilities: 
And speaking about utilization, it has a small display with no touchscreen. So it also matters, especially when chosing a device for such a long period of time. 
Did you consider other wallets than these?
@_date: 2019-02-01 09:24:55
Hey, congrats) Then it's the right time to think about where exactly to keep it for the next 10 years ;)  
You know... to put and forget (and just to be sure that your BTC are still there after all that time).
@_date: 2019-02-19 15:49:08
Yes, good idea. Already implemented in a couple of wallets btw.
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:05:55
Chuck can keep his crypto on cloud storage. And it is cold.
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:41:49
Well, yes. Obviously, that's the idea of a cold storage, that you can't access to the savings without a pass. But you hardly can blame a wallet, as it sounds more like a management mistake to let something like that happened. You always need a plan B.
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:24:49
Well, the more different devices you can connect to your wallet, the more chances it will be compromised. On the one hand, USB, NFC etc. are quite handy, but cold wallet must be secure (that's the idea, right?). So the less connections there are, the safer it is.
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:18:02
Fair enough...
