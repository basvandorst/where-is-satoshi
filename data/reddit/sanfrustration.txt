Investment advice is always structured around what your financial goals are, what your time horizon is, and what your level of risk tolerance is.
These are questions others cannot answer for you, however I think the most important issues in your situation would be to understand how risky Bitcoins truly are, and to relate that level of risk to your "expendable" Euro savings and Bitcoin holdings.  Expendable to one person might be flying coach instead of first class, and to another not eating out at a restaurant for a month...

I completely cashed out of almost all of my BTC recently.  As the value reached all-time highs, I realized a few important things.
1.) **There was no reasoable way to secure these assets or ensure my family would be able to inherit them.**  Sure, I could do cold storage, or get a cheap computer offline and store them there, but this isn't practical whatsoever, I'm not terribly technical, and if I were to be hit by a bus tomorrow, these funds would be lost forever.  Also, there is no insurance.  If somebody hacks into my bank account, I'm covered for 100% of the loss.  There is zero protection with BTC, and I'd even have the added frustration of being able to track every move the thief makes after stealing my coins.
2.) **Most BTC cheerleaders have a vested interest in the success of the currency based on greed rather than in revolutionizing the world or creating a greater good.**  They crush any dissenting opinions, upvote spam posts from shady vendors to "grow the community," and downvote any legitimate questions or concerns about the currency.  In fact, I'm guessing this comment will have a number of downvotes despite it being a sincere attempt to add to the discussion.
3.) **The entire "value" of the currency is based on inflated demand and limited supply of a virtual good.**  The minute there is any shock to the system, the whole house of cards will come crashing down rapidly.  We saw this occur very briefly a little less than a year ago with the v0.8 fork, and if any part of the verification process is compromised or exploited, it will happen again instantly.  
I still think the idea is fascinating, however the majority of interest is from people looking to make money out of thin air (miners) and people looking to make money off of appreciation (speculators).  I believe the chorus of their cheers in the midst of their euphoria has drowned out common sense, and they have no idea this bubble is about to burst in a spectacular fashion yet again.

Profit is proceeds minus cost.  In the past your proceeds were quite high and your costs could be somewhat low.  This was due to limited competition, a high incentive to mine or verify transactions and the flexibility of your computing rig.
Today, proceeds are much lower and are declining every day in the face of increased competition, and you need a really expensive rig to even compete.  So if your proceeds have declined dramatically and your costs haven't declined or have even increased, you'll understand the mining landscape today versus in the past.

I'm not sure how anything other than the volatility can be represented with this ticker.
Delays/disruptions or other dirty laundry won't be aired with this ticker, as it is merely a reflection of the last trade on MtGox.  Perhaps the only unfortunate thing will be that it appears to have started at the lofty price of $153, but who knows how this will all play out.  I see no downside relative to no ticker existing, since anybody can get the exact same quotes from mtgox.com

If I were a drug dealer on Silk Road, I'd debate cashing out and quitting the game ever day the past month.  During this panic selling, taking $3 million off the table and walking away isn't such a bad idea...

Correct, I should have clarified that.

Where did he mention he bought in January 2013?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:11:59
Correct, and while they could theoretically enter a bunch of historical pricing data retroactively, I highly doubt they'd do this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:57:32
Obviously not.  The problem is that there are probably at least 100 sellers for every 1 buyer.  Unless you slow or halt trading, the price will plummet until some point, when a massive influx of buyers will appear causing delays but more importantly extremely erratic execution (your panicked sell order at $70 could be executed at $3 in the mayhem).

I give you my full permission and approval to prove yourself here in this thread.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:52:40
I'm not familiar with any of the math, but aren't these estimates usually for one computer or mining setup running 24/7?  What about 10,000 running part-time... would that significantly reduce the odds, or is it still so astronomical that this winds up being just a drop in the ocean?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:05:45
As I understand it, volume is very deceptive in that it counts your remaining balance in the total if you don't sell all your coins.
For example, if you had 10 BTC and sold 1, the volume would reflect the 1 BTC PLUS the 9 BTC adjustment to your account.  You sell another and it would be 1 PLUS the 8 BTC coming back to you.  So 2 trades of 2 BTC would show 'volume' of 19 BTC.  Add in thousands of other traders in an environment like this and it is virtually impossible to get a true measure of volume without analyzing each transaction in the log.

This is most certainly a bubble.  You're looking at a one year gain of over 3,500% due primarily to frenzied speculation.
There is a long way to go for universal adoption and application of Bitcoin for the masses, and anybody that suggests otherwise is not being practical.
If you are smart and still want to participate in any future gains, you should sell half your holdings right now to lock in SOME substantial gains while still holding a decent sized position.  It was amazing to me how many people didn't do this during the first tech bubble, so I'll close with a highly relevant quote:


@_date: 2013-04-12 18:22:44
Yeah, it is newsworthy because all the physical gold in the world is worth $7.7 trillion dollars (which doesn't include futures or derivatives).
A 4% decline is $308 billion, or 343x the entire market value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:23:18
I'm not a tax adviser, but I'd venture it would be no different than claiming gambling losses.  Meaning you can do it, but you are opening yourself up to high degree of scrutiny and virtually a guaranteed audit.  
The only thing I would see changing that would be official filings and cost data from the exchange(s) handling your transactions, but that is a long way coming if at all.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:34:46
Wow, a proud merchant standing by his/her love of BTC!  And an ethical one at that, hiding behind a 5 minute old throwaway account so as '"not to seem spammy."
I, for one, am highly impressed with this "lesson in some very basic rules of business..." especially the one where you teach us to not promote what you're selling in a forum full of people more than eager to reward your optimism!

You need to have a 100% return to gain back what you lost if you lose 50%.  Gains and losses are not symmetrical due to risk drag.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:41:52
I gave numerous examples, so it seems you're one of the only people that views a "bubble" in that manner.

With all due respect, do some homework.  There is a very elaborate answer to every one of these questions easily available to you after 1 minute of searching google.
But I'll give you a very brief answer anyhow:
* The 'highly profitable' era of mining bitcoins is long over.  While it is true that better rigs will yield better results, those results are far inferior today to what they were in the past and will continue to decline in the future.
* This can't be a serious question.  When would a better time to invest be if not the bottom?  With a fixed supply, the more demand the higher the price.  The upside is directly tied to that demand.
* Yes, deflation is inevitable so long as demand outpaces that fixed supply.  And when you think about people hoarding coins as speculators or consumers or even of people losing access to their coins, you can see how supply can be even further constrained.
The question you didn't ask were the risks.  You only covered how to profit and what upside that profit had, which is not the best way to consider an investment.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:16:30
Serious question here, but why aren't there more miners out there shifting their focus on cracking the keys of large pools of unspent BTC?  Wouldn't that be a much larger reward than the slim chance of verifying a block for 25 BTC?

@_date: 2013-12-18 14:09:58
Listen to yourself. What is normal?  Is a 1,000% gain in less than a year 'normal?'  Of course it isn't. But you won't see a 50% gain in bitcoin in a day, gains are gradual. You'll only see a 50% drop in a day because that's how markets work. It is called a correction and your little rule is effectively censoring any news or observations surrounding negative occurrences in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 12:47:33
This is a no brainer. Sell $10k worth and lock that value in. BTC is one shock away from another crash, and you won't be seeing any more 1000% returns in the next decade. 
You'll still have some left, but now you can enjoy a nice trip to Europe or Bali or Australia or wherever you've always wanted to go. 
Greed is the wrong emotion here, so if you're tempted to hold it to hope it's worth $100k you're going to have a bad time... Especially with a job and the retirement benefits you'll be getting at your age. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:09:12
I'm speechless that this piece actually came from Bloomberg.
An "environmental disaster" is the Japanese Nuclear Plant, or the recent Exxon spill, or fracking fluid causing well water to ignite out of the faucet.
Most would consider Innovation and economic growth that don't taint or obliterate our natural resources a good thing... not an "environmental disaster."
Equating a minor blip on the electric grid and that slight increase in demand to a disaster while ignoring everything else is a rather surprising conclusion to see coming from this source.

The infrastructure is quite valuable and innovative, so it won't go to zero.  The question is, what is a fair valuation in a current environment with very few transactions (most of them illegal) and rampant speculation?
There is a reason the Capital Markets are highly regulated and analysts get paid quite a bit of money to determine fair value.
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:31:16
Merchants have very slim margins and would never risk their capital needed for daily operations on speculative investments.  Now banks on the other hand...

Wrong.  The U.S. housing market was a bubble, and it simply repriced to more realistic levels.  Same with tulips.  Same with tech stocks. "Zero or near zero" valuation has nothing to do with most bubbles.

I'm not an accountant and this should not be construed as tax advice, but you shouldn't have to report any of the proceeds you received as taxable income. 
These were individual gifts made to you, and gifts are not taxable to the recipient. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:15:41
And my point is, any value happening this rapidly shares the exact same characteristics as every other bubble mentioned.  If it looks and acts like a bubble, its a bubble.  
This isn't complicated, and you're simply trying to justify what you clearly don't understand very well... that this is rampant speculation, pure and simple, since there is very little commerce occurring right now in BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:32:05
