Rest is the change address. Google change address in Bitcoin.. those btcs are still in the wallet of the sender, just in a new address

I have little idea about this. It's better you write to them, explaining the entire thing, and see if they revert. Hope for the best I guess. It's currency deposit, so they cannot exactly run away with it.

If it drops out of mem pool, ur balance will return.
For speeding up, u can try transaction accelerators, though i havent tried one before so cannot recommend any, but u can search for it in this sub reddit

An input to your transaction is unconfirmed therefore it is taking time.
And this input in itself is a huge transaction from around 600 inputs.. 
It might take a while but hopefully will go through

In simple terms, the transaction is like he spent the money he didn't have. To have the money, your wallet should have all confirmed transactions. 
Usually happens when u try to withdraw mining income etc.
If you just transact between wallets and exchanges, this problem wouldnt occur usually

Because active traders have fiat currency on exchanges like GDAX. It will take 2-3 days to deposit money in the other exchange, and by then, the arbitrage would reduce making it not be worth the effort. Plus fees also
That's why some days ago, BTC hit $19000 on GDAX while other exchanges were around $17000.

agreed... Best to spread in 2-3 exchanges at least.

no, you cannot delete Bitcoin. The coins are still there in the Blockchain. The only thing the person can do is deleting the private key. That would be digital equivalent to putting all your money in a safe/locker and setting a random and long password on it - You know the money's there, in the locker, but you can't have it without the password.  And No, sorry, you cannot break the safe with your fancy machines and tools. :P
The total bitcoins ever mined would still be 21 million, including theirs.

Abandon? No ..
Reduce Stake? Depends on my country..
Has my country done this before (e.g. China)? If yes, shift to a wallet and wait for it. 
Has my country not done this before? Yes, I'll personally reduce my stake a little bit, due to tax complications if I bring the money in from a foreign exchange

It can go both ways: they can crush its investment part, like the current situation, or they can accept it by allowing people and businesses to use crypto as a way to buy and purchase stuff, and go for some regulated mutual framework.
At the end, they will need to keep a check on how bitcoin is distributed or created, since ofcourse, no one would want to lose the power of printing money. Mutual co-existence is possible in the near future but yes that requires the effort of people, businesses and governments. 
Having said that, no country would want to lose the race of crypto since crypto is definitely the future, in this form or some other form.

Same as they do now. In packaging, they can write different amount (like currently they write in USD, EUR etc). Whatever people are willing to pay for that commodity, is the price. And if bitcoin becomes the sole currency, it will be less volatile, so need to bind to a value, rather few thousand satoshis can be assigned a fix number or the basic unit, to ease the calculations.
But such a situation will never arise. Fiat currencies and precious metals are and will always be the economic measures of wealth and price.

I am just refreshing coinmarketcap. Most are traders who are trying to sell high and buy low. 
Some are selling, and hoping to buy later with more quantity, but are really ending up buying high, selling low :P, once they see couple of green candles.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:59:51
Yes might be accurate, since there are so many coins trying to do the same thing, in the same way. Eventually, some will phase out but some will survive and then thrive!

In this hypothetical situation, bitcoin will be pegged against bitcoin. Product prices will be mentioned in terms of bitcoin. As long as you can use a particular item for all the work (buying essentials, paying taxes,etc), it's a currency to you. So if everyone accepts bitcoin including the government (for taxes etc), then its the new currency

They'll get to know the name on the bank account, once you send the deposit details. Kinda defeats the purpose if they ask a person to enter the name on the bank account.
Don't worry, as long as you send from the same-name account and follow the deposit instructions (reference code etc), you'll be fine :)

I think he means, if coinbase renamed B2X as BTC due to "accumulated difficulty" logic, then the original BTC would be again called BTC when it reaches higher accumulated difficulty. In simpler terms, coinbase would be switching "BTC" between original BTC and B2X every other week/month. That would be hilarious, if not just ridiculous :P

Yeah, and make this whole crypto thing look more risky. It gives the impression that a team of developers and miners, can one day get bored of the same thing and fork into a new coin.
Though newbies think this bonus coin is free money, but it isn't. Divided coin will never reach what the single unified coin would have.
