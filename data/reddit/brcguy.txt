So you'd sell it now for some amount over 1 btc and then sit on the coins until they're worth so much I can buy a house?  Is that the idea?

Update when you find out!  For science!

I so don't understand what's so annyoing about it.   Some neckbeards gettin tard-rage because their thread is a little cluttered?  Then Rage on all the bad Pun Threads first.  Fix that shit and then bitch about robots.
I hate captionbot with all my hate muscles.  But I don't think it should be banned...

Cash out enough bitcoins to pay the taxes and disappear properly.

It's the one just after the ones with the error.  Casascius is spelled correctly on it.  It's not perfectly mint - it spent a few years in a change jar.  I can't decide if I want to get some cash out of it now or hold it on the chance that BTC will increase wildly in value.  It's not doing anyone any real good right now other than sitting in a drawer with some silver coins for company....

Kinda like how bitcoin tipbot was everywhere for a while?  
Geez - lay off the caps lock pal.

Buy a house.  Seriously.  A down payment of 20% or more gets you a great interest rate and other benefits.  Plus that way you won't blow it on hookers and blow, and games, and a fancy car that you'll trash.  A house keeps its value, mostly.

The only bitcoin I have is a Cassacius 1BTC coin that I received as a tip while bartending.  I threw it in my change jar and forgot about it until it hit $1,000.  Found it - put it somewhere safe and now it's the best tip I've ever gotten for anything.  That's as free as it gets for sure.

One million sounds totally crazypants.  I would have an extremely hard time holding it past 100k....

Can I use a qr code without an amount?  The site would calculate shipping costs etc, and I don't think I can generate codes on the fly....
Would it be as simple as asking the customer to pay my wallet via qr and send me a screencap of the shopping cart so I have what they want and where to send it?  
I know I can add a graphic to the checkout screen.....

Yeah, I'm using cart66, which currently doesn't support it directly....
