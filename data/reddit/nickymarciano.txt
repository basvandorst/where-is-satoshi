I got cash in hand waiting for such a dip since the beginning of the year. It would put me in such a greatmood for a few days...and then i would freak out hahaha

Argentina is devaluating their currency plenty. I.e 36% during August.
 It really makes sense to buy any durable good valuated in eur or usd, as it is regarded as a reserve of value. Bitcoin is particularly good, as it allows the transaction to be under the table...

That is what i do. It gets me in a bad mood. So i only check this when the candles are green.
I still follow price daily, and continue to buy or sell depending on hunches. It is going alright. I only trade about 1/20 of total, and months can pass between trades.

I find that now my move is done, and i just basically wait for the next halving, and take it from there

I dont know hahaha.
I expect price to go up as it did with the last one, as supply will shrink. This is based in my hunches and nothing else really.
I find most analysts to be quacks and ta kind of silly for the most part. I read it anyway, i like being lied to :)
Bitcoin is manipulated easily, as most people hold only and dont trade. With low volume one person can move the valuation...

I dont think it will be a big impact. Most of bitcoin has already been mined, less supply will affect miners mostly.
Cost is not necessarily attached to price. Lower price would mean less miners are able to mine and make money from it, so the extra supply slows down if price is low. This paragraph i am not sure about though.
Disclaimer i own bitcoin 50% of my savings.
