Tbh i dont have blind hatred for bch which is simply a fork of Bitcoin. You keep playing crypto politics while i focus on the real issues at hand. The actual technology and adoption of crypto.

@_date: 2017-08-19 22:34:08
That's actually really smart. Although I'm the opposite of that. I have all my money in cryptocurrencies

this isnt really about tommy tho is it. i personally dont agree with a lot of the stuff he says however this shows exactly what bitcoin can be used for. Stop making this into a political thread and lets focus on what this means for bitcoin. Ive seen you spam this thread like 3 times chill out.

This was me. I started to get rich. Still in it to get rich but i know all the technology about Bitcoin and a lot of other coins. Ive done a lot of learning and now understand how this is so much more than just profits. Its a movement. To take back control of our money.

Only because the transaction fees are so high
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:04:59
What? Scummy people use the dollar everyday, that doesn't delegitimise it.
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:41:50
Hey! You lied! 
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:01:00
What bitcoin was intended to be used as a currency not a store of value. High transaction fees is what forced it to be a store of value. This can be fixed and probably will be. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:53:17
What are you trying to argue? bitcoin is not a better store of value than gold right now. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:15:18
Not really tho is it. Gold is extremely stable compared to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:35:58
Exactly so its not like bitcoin. Its a store of value. I can place my money in it and the change will be rather small so my value stays the same. Store of value. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:31:25
Hence why i am saying at this current time you cannot compare it to gold
