Oh, I will clear up the confusion. He mistaken said 2 Gigameg instead of 2 Gig block. This gives his SV node the power to quickly propagate 2 gigabyte blocks, containing millions of transactions, to hundreds of other nodes around the world. He will earn many Bitcoin in fees for a block that size, while all the users will have tiny transaction fees. Hope this helps.

He talks about some of the early coins in [this blog](
"Dave ran  machines as did a few other people. I don’t know how many of his  earliest bitcoin Dave kept, I never discussed it. In 2009, bitcoin had  no real cost. So, outside of my personal addresses, I don’t know what  was actually kept. I doubt that the machines running at the charities or  churches I was involved with at the time even exist anymore. My  estimate would be that they managed to collect amongst them between  80,000 and 100,000 bitcoin. If they exist, I hope they do the same  people well. You never know, things turn up.
Then,  people don’t understand the cost associated with it. The cost of the  Internet connections, the servers, the Microsoft licenses, and the electricity alone came to more than people would care to remember. All  up, I spent around AU$1.1 million. As such, between the period of 2007  and mid-2009, I had costs that would be directly attributed to Bitcoin  of about 70% of the same value. I think my mortgage at one stage between  the three properties I owned had blown up to around AU$1.4 million.
 It’s why I needed to sell my ranch."

So, if the losing group of miners want to win more block rewards in the future, they will have to improve their hardware and make the network even faster with more scaling capability? Interesting.
