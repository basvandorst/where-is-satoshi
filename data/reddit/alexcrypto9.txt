Another greedy hodler is trying to prove that black is white. Do you really think that mining power consumption is good thing? :)) Just be honest. People here is to get quick profit and it is ok for them that our world goes to global catastrofyl step by step.

It has very big impact. It is just attempt to mess people. And it can't replace fiat so it is just big addition to environmental impact.

Quite big addition to environmental impact. And minning is quite useless addition. Honestly.. Step by step and we will see environmental catastrofy. It is just attempt to hide head in sand when people are trying to compare mining with other useless power consumption. The fact is that people are just greedy and trying to somehow  calm themselves using such graphics.

@_date: 2018-03-15 09:17:37
Don't compare... it is not the game you are fool but you are also fool. Useless environmental unfriendly minning dot.

You can have a look at fork drama in 2017. Impovments are almost impossible in btc due to conflict of interests. Btc is 1.x crypto. There are already 2.x and 3.x generations. There is for example a coin that doesn't use blockchain at all. How abput that? Lightining network is out-date in 2018.

Do you redy to pay such amoun of money for BTC transaction??? Just do research and compare with Ripple. And you will get the answer that BTC is obsolete. Nothing worth except pioneering and a lot of noise from people who made a lot of money on it and hope to make more. Ask youself What is the difference between LTC and BTC? BTC is extremley more expensive and from techonology point of view is worse than LTC(LTC has segwit now). Open Your eyes guys! BTC is just useless coin that is overestimated.
