I like the idea (from Andreas Antonopolous' talk) of thinking of these private blockchains as similar to corporate intranets.  Useful for each company sure, but they aren't the big innovation.  The big deal is still the open internet.  
Private blockchains may very well help these organizations reduce costs and streamlines processes, but their existence does nothing to make the decentralized Bitcoin blockchain less powerful and useful to everyone else.

It's 2017.  Do you really need a fax machine?

I feel like I just wasted 30 min.  It's an ok talk, but he's essentially repeating the same simple point over and over again.

Hmm, this looks like a sidechain that is still linked to the Bitcoin blockchain, no?

Would it not be much easier for them to just have a private centralized database that they all share and have access to to?  Why does it have to be distributed?  
What's the benefit of a blockchain in such a scenario?  To prevent cheating?  Would it still not be insecure from attacks?  Would there be a mining arms race between the banks?

Thanks for the response.  Can you explain a bit more about how a  private chain with no mining works?

This reminds me of The Wire...

Just made a purchase (via coinbase) thanks for the discount!

Came here to say the same.  No one's done this yet?

What's missing from this train of thought is that if Bitcoin's value increases so greatly, it will be because it is actually becoming useful and widely used as a means of every-day transaction.  It will have become a useful, stable currency of its own.  So, as time goes on there's less and less reason to "cash out".  It will become "cash" itself.

Def. not well known yet.

Yes, this is clearly the right approach and it's what early adopters must do if they want to support the bitcoin ecosystem's growth.  
The only argument I can see against this approach is:
*When you purchase bitcoins with dollars on coinbase you are going to pay a 1% fee.*  
However, this isn't actually a problem IF you believe that the value of bitcoins will increase enough to cover this fee amt.  And, because the original problem of saving instead of spending is what prompted you to make the transfer to begin with, this must be true for you.  So, there isn't actually a problem there.

You tried.  Don't stress about it.

I don't see bitcoin listed in the payment options (icons below) when checking out?
