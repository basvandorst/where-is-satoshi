Holy shit.  At this point, are we even going to hear an official announcement from Gox?  They're going the way of the Cheshire Cat here.
The only matter that remains to be seen is whose grin remains before they vanish completely.

The post was drafted with the word "insolvency" in the title, eh?  I'm sure it's just an honest mistake.  Yep, totally accidental, and in no way related to any special information these CEOs have preceding the official announcement by Mt. Gox.

You're right.  All this furor comes with the territory.  But I do not think the grand Bitcoin experiment needs to be regulated by state authorities, at least not yet, for I suspect that market self-regulation will be demanded by this vociferous community of libertarian-leaning Bitcoin enthusiasts -- and I want to wait and see if it will emerge from the ashes of Gox.  Already, I've seen comments indicating this may happen in the form of other exchanges soon implementing self-audits and doing so in a way that is transparent.
But this wasn't going to happen with people just focusing on the rise of their portfolios' value.  In fact, I speculate that something drastic like this was necessary to drag us back to reality.  Certainly, some are suffering for Gox's reprehensible behavior, and I do not mean to condone it.  But let's be patient and see how good our unregulated market is at policing itself while we recover from this event now that we have clear benefit of hindsight.
I, for one, want to see if the dream of frictionless money can continue moving forward.

But if most prices are denominated in the same subunit, then the relationship to the base unit, either BTC or "bits", is irrelevant.  [And we already have BTC as the official base unit](
Your reasons aren't compelling enough to justify the proliferation of a new standard, in my opinion.

Very interesting summary.  Not surprisingly, it sounds like the boring stuff came from the lawyer and regulator folks.


Now *that's* really cool.  I have long told people that my expectation for the BTC market cap is stagnation until the BTC economy begins closing.  Right now, my impression is that the number of network transactions between being bought and sold on a currency exchange is low (like one or two), so I think Overstock is doing more for the BTC economy than any day trading.

I know cries of insider trading are becoming something of a broken record, but this news seems to be no more than 20 minutes old, whereas the massive sell-off started hours ago.
Now we wait for an official statement from Mt. Gox...

Thanks for the fantastic input.  I really appreciate it.
The idea of putting up the donation address was to assure givers that the address is legitimate, nothing more.  We already have a donate page on our website, and it redirects to the University's philanthropy website, whereupon the option to provide a gift in USD that goes to an "unrestricted funds" account is immediately presented.
50% is our grant overhead as well, but it may be different for philanthropic donations.  I was unable to locate information on overhead on the website, and my advisor was reluctant to provide me information on this without more details about my "crazy idea".  In the interest of avoiding sinking too much time into what is, admittedly, a pretty wild gambit, I decided to go ahead and throw this post up before determining this information just to see if it spawned interest.
My "calculations", then, are simply estimated from my pre-tax stipend amount as an RA.  In fact, for the "minimal" case, I assumed some supplementation from my own personal account.  However, it's possible that if I raise even $10000, my advisor may deem it worth it to siphon off a bit from our current, mostly drained funding sources.  Again, since I intended this post to be exploratory, I didn't mention such details.
I'm glad to see such points raised.  Thanks again!

That makes sense.  I'll dig a bit more into it.  Thanks!

No need!  has been a bitcointip enabled sub for as long as I've known about it.
Why did it get on the bandwagon so early?  Who knows.  Maybe it's a sign that MLP fans *will* be the first major entertainment focused group on the Internet to embrace the currency.

I was tinkering with these same kind of things before I really dug into Bitcoin.  I know the [pywallet]( utility allows you to add key pairs into your wallet, but [I never found it to be all that straightforward](  Good luck to you.
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:13:59
Interesting comment.  In fact, we do have an idea that may eventually turn into a substantial patent.  Indeed, stake in intellectual property was actually included in the banner phrase "specialized benefits for individuals making larger donations".  


This I disagree with, simply because it's not true -- at least in reference to this particular crowdfunding venture.  We are determined to pursue our goals regardless of this particular source of investment.  Indeed, my advisor has done a pretty good job of tapping private sources for auxiliary funding.  Despite this, I'm still slated to go on TA next academic year.  By going on RA, the pace with which we can do research is simply accelerated.  But it would happen eventually.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:09:49
I am nearing a science PhD, and I too have experienced the BTC highs and lows you describe.
For me, I think it comes down to the fact that Bitcoin is the first time *money* has been made intellectually appealing.  It took me more than a few hours to be convinced, as I sought to understand the underlying cryptographic innovations behind the technology, but like you I went all out once I finally decided to buy in.
Fortunately, this frenzied initial burst of greed has eased up as of late.  I have even begun selling a few of my acquired coins.  Maybe for you, too, the frenzy of greed will pass.
Fun final fact: my dreams about BTC usually involve the price crashing to zero.  Guess my subconscious still isn't 100% comfortable with the idea -- maybe that's why I've begun selling!

Lol, I'm guessing this means this site is more or less common knowledge?  And here I thought I was finally moving beyond BTC n00b status.

[](/happycadance)  Well, that's customer service if I've ever seen it.  This wasn't exactly submitted as a formal complaint!
Given your actions here, I'll gladly change my tune.  The coins I (finally) have been able to purchase today won't be available to me until next week, but you can bet I'll be keeping an eye on your website!
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:49:05
Ah, forgot about that, thanks.  Yea, that's definitely a big deal then.
I spent two days downloading the Blockchain through the standard qt client, so I'm gonna swear by it, commitment bias be damned :P
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:55:11


Ugh.  If true, I'm kind of upset.  A modification of their warning or website alerting me to this fact would have saved me some frustration and some hours of sleep too.
I'll try to look into ZigGap and some of these other alternatives at some point, thanks.  Still, I was really hoping to have made a successful purchase by now, since I *really* don't have much more time I can afford to spend on this matter.
@_date: 2013-05-15 01:25:54
Cool app!  I'd love to see an increase in my local BTC activity.  So far, my LocalBitcoins buy ad has been up for two weeks straight, and I haven't heard a peep from anyone.
What amazes me most about this is that I'm in a county of 1.2 million people.  There's gotta be tons of bitcoinphiles around!

As a burgeoning scientist that came across Bitcoin in a similar way, I find your story very intriguing.  It's got me thinking about ways that I might be able to leverage Bitcoin to help with my lab's turbulent financial situation.

Not safe for the original sender, or the one returning the funds?  Does it have to do with how coins are bundled in a transaction?

When I was watching those early timestamps fly by I couldn't help but think "Man, I remember where I was when Bitcoin was still in its nascent stages".  History, indeed, and as early adopters, we're still a critical component of it!
@_date: 2013-05-08 00:21:25
Awesome!  Does this mean that Coinbase will finally attain the BTC exchange trifecta, in which the exchange process is simultaneously quick, easy, and affordable?
I certainly hope so.  After all, despite moderate frustrations, I wouldn't be holding Bitcoin right now were it not for Coinbase!
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:15:28
Your plea for reason comes at an excellent time for me.  I, too, discovered Bitcoin a while ago, in the summer of 2011.  The community at the time was immersed in the drama of security breaches at major exchanges, so despite my intention to buy, I let paranoia rule over my actions.  [After discovering something I couldn't explain]( I backed out.
After recently happening upon a flurry of Bitcoin related discussion in other subreddits, my interest was rekindled.  With hindsight and a realization of Bitcoin's long term potential, [I drafted a plan of attack]( that I thought would allow me to achieve long term investment with minimal stress.
Why am I saying all this?  Because, courtesy of this slight bubble deflation, I have just spent the last seven hours between failed attempts to fall asleep and failed attempts to purchase Bitcoin through effectively the only means I presently have, Coinbase (damn daily transaction limit!).  That these frustrations are coming off many misadventures in getting accounts and funds set up in the first place has proven quite draining.  In short, I'm letting emotion rather than reason rule over me once again.
I need to step back, eat some breakfast, and let rationality enter the picture again.  Somehow.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:47:35
Kinda wish the note he [ended his giving spree on]( was a bit more vague on what exactly he was done with. Then we could blame for the bursting bubble too. (Poor guy.)

Hey look, it's me!
This was a fun post to comment on.  A lot of folks were introduced to Bitcoin there, and I think the idea went over quite well on the whole.
[](/psychiatwi) Of course, this makes perfect sense.  Studies have shown any time you can make any sort of real world connection to the show, brony neurons go into overdrive, and they're naturally receptive to new ideas in this state.

Actually, in poking the buy button more or less half hourly since this morning, I too finally had an order go though 10 minutes ago (at $61.48 EA, no less...not gonna complain about that).  I think they're finally increasing the throughput some.
Honestly, they'd be a fantastic service if they could just handle a little more volume.  Perhaps this is the sacrifice made in having a low fee?
@_date: 2013-08-22 01:36:09
Very cool.  I've become increasingly engrossed in the world of programming as of late, and I can't help but wonder if something like this could provide the impetus to actually get me to pursue certain ideas I have.  Only problem is that the programs I'd be writing probably wouldn't appeal to those outside my discipline, so I'd be sitting at 0 BTC for quite a while.
Still, it's always nice to see things like this to get me thinking along these lines.  Guess that's kinda the point, eh?
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:25:00
Are they legitimately down?  Their website appears to be up.  I do know that every single time I tried to purchase online during the contraction to $55 this morning I was shut down with their "site-wide purchase limit reached" message.  So much for being opportunistic.
The only other purchasing option readily available to me that doesn't (necessarily) result in ridiculous surcharges would local purchasing, but both my attempts to buy with localbitcoins.com also ended in failure.
I've been at this for almost a week now with nothing to show for it, despite the fact I'm only looking to buy a few BTC for now.  I'd absolutely love to hear of an alternative for folks like me that want to stay in for the long haul and even sprinkle a bit around the BTC economy; folks that aren't trying to use it as a way to amplify their USD holdings.
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:18:02
I have a suspicion that Coinbase uses a rollover period that is partitioned into blocks, so that after a certain number of minutes, the system sheds a block that had a certain number of transactions rolled into it.  It's then able to handle a number of new transactions equal to the number of transactions that had just been cast out.  I think that would explain why my thousands of spammed clicks early this morning were futile, but more sporadic  half hourly clicks this afternoon eventually worked.
This is speculation, of course.  I have no idea how it actually works.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:25:42

It looks to me to serve many of the same functions.

[](/cadance) I just love love love 100% maple syrup, but my excitement is tempered by the fact that it looks as though the syrup on the BitMit store is marked up between 10% and 40% relative to their USD based online store, depending on jug volume and exchange rate.
I'm as excited for Bitcoin's potential as all of you are, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm only going to buy when the pricing is competitive.  That isn't the case here.
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:51:39
Well, unless your goal is amplifying your USD reserves by riding these rapid market fluctuations, 'pending' is better than 'never'.  Still sucks, though, I'll give you that.

Indeed, I'm aware of this in general, but I appreciate the clarity of your summary.
If I do get a webpage parroting my scientific interests and endeavors, a simple donation address may be a more simple and powerful way to increase exposure to Bitcoin.  It'd get visitors inquiring, and I wouldn't risk rubbing them the wrong way by appearing to be a paywalled site. We have enough of those in science already!
Also, I love the optimism in the last paragraph.  Have a small token of appreciation.
