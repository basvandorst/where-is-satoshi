Don't worry, it's all for nothing. Dogecoin just announced there is no cap on the number of Dogecoin. There is already 50 Billion and will be a lot more. It's too bad. That coin was really going to the moon, but not no mo

No, they are still checking it out. Thanks

If they're selling, buy. If they're buying, sell.
Just make sure you do your due diligence

They just announced there's no cap on Dogecoin. Such a shame  :(
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:41:20
Thank you for the response.
Please explain it to me like I'm 5

FYI I'm not paying shit for taxes when it comes to Bitcoins. Fuck the Fed!

Saw that... have been day trading all day making $40-$50 each time.
Then saw that. 
Bought back in at $450 thinking something was up.
And now I'm stuck.
Whoever did this, unless there was a reason, is a total fuck and I hope karma gets him bad

Wanted to when it was at $500. Now just holding to see what happens

In 10 minutes I just setup an account, verified my checking account and bought Bitcoins. That's so simple! Thank you so much!

I had never done it before. There was options on SR for $10/g, $20/g, and the best I could find was $65/g, so I went with the $65/g. So worth it. One puff and your soul was in the afterlife talking to aliens about the color of love. I got at least 20-30 people to experience that all off that one tiny gram. Amazing.

It's totally being manipulated too, which is great. Someone is making some serious cash, and if you see the trends on the dips, you can make some serious cash too
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:21:15
I wonder how many Bitcoins those elves have
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:04:56
I found they give you a 5 minute cancel... otherwise it's changing your account and IP address
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:05:23
But I had a backup card that is then supposed to go into effect

On mtgox is says I can do a wire transfer from my bank. Is it just that simple?
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:47:13
Will do! Thanks dude!
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:55:24
Who would turn down free money?
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:27:46


You're not understanding me. I know it's done it before, it even got up to 1240 today. But then it just goes back down.
I think this time is different. There is a lot of big orders coming through at high prices
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:43:44
Sure, "IF".. that was the question
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:53:03
just had to fill in some space... like a vagina, booyah!

Anyone accepting Bitcoin is a good thing!

One posting about my frustrations with coinbase has nothing to do with spamming
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:54:17
We that looking for Bitcoins looking for trading strategy's to acquire more.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:48:31
Well, whatever it is, I'm cashing in on it
love this site:
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:14:11
you're satire
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:00:21
Since this happened, there is no big order profiting from this... only big orders losing money
don't get??
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:58:05
It did get filled as you can see from the chart
it's a cool 150k the person lost
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:56:28
omg, it's already almost recovered. Yesterday when this happened it took a good 15-20 hours to recover.... now it's under an hour. Evolution ha
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:00:57
I'm disappoint  :(
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:13:04
I would normally agree... but there is still no real big buy orders.... no attempts at one. The big orders that are continuing to come in are sell orders, all at this lower price
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:56:14
I'm in the camp selling off and then buying at a lower price
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:21:56
That would be a good t-shirt
