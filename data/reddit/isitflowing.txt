What a garbage post. That's not what he said at all.

No, it requires the private keys from m of n of the public addresses that were used to create the multisig address. The only thing similar would be the redeem script that you get when you create the multisig address. This along with the private keys are required when spending from the multisig address.

The password was specific to each key. They only changed when the keys were re-assigned to someone else.

Good point, all the ATMs I worked with only used $20 bills.

Haha, good luck, those things are really tough though. 
The ones we had, this was 10 years ago, included a decoy vault dial. If some unauthorized individual got to the ATM some how the assumption was they would spin the dial to "crack" it. When actually spinning the dial will lock down the entire unit. The only way in at that point would be with a plasma cutter. The actual way to open it was with small magnetic keys, only the branch manager, assistant manager and myself had those keys. Once those were in place we would punch in our 6 digit password on a keypad above the decoy dial and then we would turn the handle which would open to door to the cartridges.

I think that's a good idea. With only $50 per paycheck you don't over expose yourself making yourself less likely to have knee-jerk reactions in case of market volatility, like the large drops we had last year. Also $50 per paycheck should add up pretty quickly over the years. And if BTC is a long-term success in 10+ years it will be a better a retirement than any 2% matching 401k. No fees, no age restrictions, etc. Good luck!

Wow! As a former vault supervisor at Washington Mutual each ATM could hold an absolute maximum of $20,000 per cartridge with 4 cartridges per ATM. That's $80K per ATM if completely stuffed full. Typically we would cut out a handful of bills in each cartridge to prevent jams. So although they could hold $80K most were holding in the low to mid $70K. On normal weekends it wouldn't be unusual if one ATM ran out of cash. With a bank run, and lines like these at 1AM I would suspect most bank ATMs will run out very quickly. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:42:43
It's automatic. Once a cartridge runs out a little piece of plastic sticks out telling the machine it's empty so it pulls from another cartridge.

In order to make it easy for existing market participants to use Gemini, we have attempted to be compatible with Bitfinex.com where possible. Differences are highlighted below

You can do that with bc.infos websocket and javascript. 
Here's a fiddle I made:

The passwords were memorized, I guess they could be written down if you were forgetful. If you forgot or didn't have your password then you could not get in. You would have to have the branch manager or assistant manager use their key instead. At which point the key with the forgotten password would have to be re-programmed using one of the working keys.

All money was well accounted for. If you "yoinked" it would be well known by close of business day.

No not straight from the Fed. Only specific banks get deliveries fresh from the Fed. At Washington Mutual in California we bought our money from Bank of California. Yes it came in armored cars.

It will technically be labeled as a double spend since the inputs were spent twice. But yes, the purpose of the tutorial was how to clear a stuck transaction by using the first-seen-safe replace-by-fee double spend node policy. It's not a tutorial on how to rip someone off ;)

Why pay when you can do for free?
Open your bitcoin-qt. Goto -&gt; Help -&gt; Debug Window
In the chatbox looking thing type: 
    dumpprivkey 1Jnm3adckd621Dfpp0120aasdfasdf
Replace the above with the your bitcoin address and it will respond with your private key. You can now take that and put it on paper, or import it to a different wallet.

Which wallet? Most of them have an area that says import and you would just have to paste in your private key.

Exactly, if we can't get past this the future of bitcoin is very bleak. This is a test to the bitcoin experiment. Can a bunch of strangers all agree to the same change to the bitcoin protocol?

Then maybe you should stop telling all your peers about it. Instead just do your thing and make them interested in asking you about it. Your peers might feel like you are trying to sell them something, and most people immediately switch off when they sense a sale-pitch. 
"What's that app you're using?"
"Oh nothing, just a money app"
"A 'money' app??"
"Well it's actually bitcoin..."
"Oh that's a real thing? I thought it was dead, etc"
Something like that to make them ask questions instead.

You guy's know what a Roku is?
Imagine the 21 computer put inside a Roku like box. It could allow a free Netflix like service that is paid by the mining chip built inside the unit. 
So you buy the unit and just by plugging it in (mining) it will pay for the subscription fee itself through bitcoin mining. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:15:32
Well you can't expect a real answer here since no one is able to determine the net worth of each internet user. Some internet users have billions in net worth others have next to nothing. Your question has no possible right answer only guess-timations. 
For fun let's just say each internet user invests $100 USD into bitcoin. 100 x 2.94 billion = 294 Billion so around $14k per coin if you assume there are 21 million coins and none have been lost.

I'm a big fan of keeping my cold storage on paper. But I'm not a huge fan of encrypting my private keys for various personal reasons. It's also a good idea to store them in multiple locations (home, safe deposit box, etc) in case of fire or other sort of awesome natural destruction.
