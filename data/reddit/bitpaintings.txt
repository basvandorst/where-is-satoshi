No worries, we are oriented towards projecting both the recognizable Bitcoin logo with metaphorical layers of various kinds. We understand that the appeal is more geared towards those startups and businesses who might wish to decorate their office space or homes with a familiar, yet colorful representation of Bitcoin. Thanks for your comment!

Greetings, fellow Bitcoiners!
We'd like to take a moment to introduce you to our new online art gallery devoted to celebrating the metaphor, passion, and symbolism that lives on within the Bitcoin and Blockchain inventions. 
At Bitpaintings.com we cater to those in the Bitcoin community who wish to express and display their passion though oil based art. Our paintings attempt to bring creative light to this space in our own unique way. Please come on in and look around, we hope to have new offerings soon, and definitely want to hear back from you, the community, on what you might like to see in the future. We'd also like to hear about ways that we might improve our site. Additionally, we know that some of you may find some of our work a little pricey, and we hope to offer prints at some point in the near future at a greatly reduced price point. 
Here are some examples of our recent work:
[Atlas Unchained](
[A Tsunami is Coming](
[Leviathan of Satoshi](
[New York Also Rises](
Thanks and enjoy!

Looks cool! We'd love to have something like this integrate with Woocommerce to also allow real time exchange rate BTC/Fiat conversion on the product page, so that the customer can view prices in fiat and/or BTC. See this homepage for an [example of what I mean](
We currently have to manually update the BTC equivalent ourselves. We've looked into other options but everything out there is too wonky or won't work with our current woocommerce setup. If anyone here knows of a possible solution we'd sincerely appreciate it. 
Keep up the good work!
