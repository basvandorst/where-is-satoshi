 - Sigh - I am tired of these

It is not really funny but it seems like over on they are saying the opposite.  I almost think both sides will fail.  Greed will kill both BTC and BTH.  Divided we fall.

If my money disappears because of poor coding or interfaces on their part then it is stolen.  The message the BRD wallet displayed was:
"BRD cannot be authenticated due to a bug in your version of Android."
I'm pretty sure that is not a Samsung on the Verizon network bug. It has mysteriously started working again. I thought it was Wifi vs mobile networks and someone suggested port 8333 was being blocked but it still is working - so far on Wifi. It is a small amount of money and I had other larger amounts of money in other places which have no such issues. I am just tired of crypto-coins.  I was running a Bitcoin node (bitcoind) for a while then I was running a litecoind node (still am) but it is really not worth it.  My (currently) $41 of bitcoin was worth $101 at one time.  And it was when I started $5 (converted from dogecoin which I transferred to bitcoin.)  What if I had $41,000 dollars in that wallet?  I would be much sadder.

I recovered it after several tries.  It does not seem to function on WiFi, it worked on Moble Data though. Bad.  But now down to $41 dollars anyway. I am getting out of crypto-coins.  Not worth it.
