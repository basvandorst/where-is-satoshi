Heh.. yeah, that word is a great signal for when you are conversing with a 13 year old wannabe edgy chips. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:31:13
Oh dear.. you can't even troll proper. Sweet slow child. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:18:11
Oh dear... Really? You are too dumb to realize when someon makes fun of you?

Things Bitcoin Maximalists convince themselves of when they missed out on 1000% profit in 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:01:59
Ha ha. Yeah no shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:13:49
But what if I'm 13 and sad that Bitcash isn't worth zero. Playcate me!!!
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:13:12
No, the president is. You are just not paying attention. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:12:17
Slam dunk!

Let me know when BCH crashes and burns due to it "never working because 1 MB blocks are already too big". 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:17:50
And you are doing your part to make sure this subreddit is the exact same thing. Smart move. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:59:18
No shit Sherlock. Bitfinex haven't been solvent since they started and the entire board and owners should be in prison. They stole from their own customers. Period. They didn't pay back shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:30:49
If you think Bitcoin can just shrug off a double fork and nothing can ever challenge it you aren't very smart. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:25:48
No fees? What kind of unqualified bullshit is that? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:50:22
Rediculous late fees? Are you in crack? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:46:47
Exciting, in 2009 when this hadn't been posted 950 times.

Or just sell if you need money, buy if you think it's going higher and don't pretend to know what price is gonna be.

Can we just agree to not use that bloated moron in memes.

@_date: 2017-08-23 18:27:02
This sub is no different. I'm convinced that 90% of Reddit users in crypto are either bots or 13 year old basement dwelling tweens with anger management issues.

@_date: 2017-08-23 18:37:05
You have been here for long enough that one would expect you to not be constantly on your period. That's about It. 
If you really care about account age you are dumber than a rock since not only does a 10 year account cost like $15, but it's entirely pointless since many people have a bunch of Alt accounts (like yourself) so what's your fucking point? 
You literally argue account age, and then explain that this is your "alt account" are you fucking slow?
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:44:44
Well of course you are. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:49:12
Yes. A bunch or alts. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:14:08
Just because you are 12 and don't understand doesn't mean you are right. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:44:22
The whole point of trading is that you don't have to trust anything. Doesn't make the money any less valuable. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:01:10
OP is pretty much a complete idiot. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:48:50
So no. But you really want people to send you Bitcoin for your illegal streaming service or affiliate scheme. 
How original.

Here comes the USDT crash and Bitfinex insolvency. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:05:06
I'm not taking side in the debate at all or well that's not my argument. I just think it's more interesting if someone more technical weights in than someone with just "money and an opinion". 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:05:16
You can only withdraw USD as a US member. You should read TOS and whine less.

Yunbi is a pretty damn scammy exchange and should be history though. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:03:51
No offense but it's adorable that you think something is wrong based on 3 days without an answer. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:56:28
These are the kinda of decisions that make people broke. Have fun. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:57:48
It's not. Source: common sense. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:21:41
So you used a trading service, to for zero reason what so ever send 100s of tiny transactions. And now you are surprised they don't want you as a customer? Ok...
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:02:41
Oh dear, if you think Trace Mayer knows more about blockchain tech or Bitcoin than Jannsens you shouldn't even be here. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:13:53
Trace is about as much a crypto currency expert as the average hamster. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:09:04
Buying large amounts of Bitcoin within 20% of lifetime high using money you need. Dumbest idea in history. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:47:17
I am suggesting that there is zero guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to rise in price from any price level. And we aren't talking about $2 "chance" here. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:00:42
OP wildly overestimating the share of cipherpunks vs. amateur traders in this sub. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:47:08
We know this without being told ap by Putin's bitch. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:49:31
$300 mil isn't even that well funded compared to Bitmain. Gonna be interesting to see how they respond. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:48:11
No. Because if you look at it without pink sunglasses you will notice that bad news also peak search results. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:00:48
And yet with this "overwhelming core support" we will soon have 2 forks, and core might very well lose hash rate dominance. 
Hard to call that a "win" in any sense of the word. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:28:34
Shh. That doesn't support OPs thesis. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:47:23
Trends doesn't equal price. Correlation doesn't equal causation. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:27:32
If you use kraken to day trade you already goofed up.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:26:40
To be fair, I know almost nothing about the average Hamsters blockchain competence. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:52:19
You mean the fact that I answered a comment with verbatim his response. Yeah, terrible. Are you mentally slow or do you just play on on TV?
Edit. Hah, cute he removed every single one of his comments. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:29:51
As I am sure that most people misjudge Roger due to not agreeing with his opinion. Which has little to do with technical competence. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:22:32
Some old grumpy bastard. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:48:39
Ha ha. Ok kiddo, wanna bet I have been involved with crypto longer than you? Don't make an ass of yourself. Trace Mayer is about as technical as a gerbil. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:54:45
Read the follow up comment doofus. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:45:34
Butter? Not at all. But it feels sort of pointless to put any stock in a random rich guy betting on something technical he has nothing to do with. Sure it would be sort of fun if Jamie Diamond bet on a Dogecoin fork, but sort of pointless. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:46:39
Yep. And sure, you can get "free" power by stealing it. But you better believe that it's risky and not something large scale miners do. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:27:32
If you use kraken to day trade you already goofed up.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:12:15
Ok, I probably should have narrowed it to "technical" knowledge. He definitely have enough knowledge on "crypto" in general to have broad opinions. 
My point was just that it's not that interesting of a wager since he's more of an investor/opinion person than technically/dev proficient.
I also think the bets are sort of "silly" since we are talking about people who have had a 15x return on their large holdings in 12 months alone. Not really a "massive risk' if you're still sit on $1 billion worth of coin, +Bitcoin Cash +whatever the 2x split will be worth. 
Not to mention that no matter, the fork will hold large value. So it's really not much of a win or lose situation. (Actually with a hedge it could be a win/win for both parties).
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:33:01
$3500 on some Chinese exchanges under high volume. We're heading sub $4k 
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:50:44
I guess then do your homework or GTFO tardboy. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:48:34
Lots of pitfalls with 7nm, outside of the approx $25 million tape out cost of the first batch. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:50:06
Hah, of course you can. You can run a fractional reserve of literally anything. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:53:58
Okidoki pasta boy, I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for your alt-account opinion since you removed your old comments. 
Grow the fuck up. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:59:49
In the respect that you risk funds in hope for a return based on chance that you cannot control. Yes. How is this hard to grasp?
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:55:08
So you are about to lose a bet. What else?
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:08:37
Agreed. And yes, neither of them are deeply technical. Roger However as much as one can detest his opinion is actually fairly technically knowledgeable. Nowhere near "qualified developer" technical, but still no dunce. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:59:12
Edit. Made a stupid. Referred to the Mycelium ICO. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:50:26
$3 million doesn't even cover tape out cost of 7nm ASIC. Not even close. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:49:05
If you are so new to Bitcoin you flash your hardware wallet using a non verified domain you shouldn't own Bitcoin . 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:51:00
Absolutely did. Editing comment. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:21:50
I doubt it. Also not really correct use of any of that. But, you do you bae. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:07:41
Yeah I was mostly joking. You can def get a house under $4 mil. Not a mansion though. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:41:13
Kim Dotcom and Julian Assange are hilarious and entertaining, but hardly people to pay real attention to. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:29:14
What the western first world morons don't get is that what we consider "cheap payments" is a necessity because unless you can transaction for $0.001 Bitcoin value is capped as a useful means of payment in many parts of the world where $0.10 represents actual value. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:42:47
No it's not. $20k is a lot of money, but if you really invested "your life" into crypto you already chose to risk it foolishly. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:29:00
Ha ha. Just a way of saying "dork". Like an "insult light" in the best 1950s fashion. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:57:07
Correlation / Causation. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:21:41
Doesn't matter. If they cannot use high volume exchanges to trade it will cause high sell pressure for months (even if temporary). Don't underestimate the effect of this on price. We could see sub $3000 easily. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:43:28

@_date: 2017-09-13 01:32:15
Obviously risks can be calculated. It's just plain dumb that people tend to see crypto as some kind of "eventually it will go up" based on "so far it has". It's a terrible attitude and sure to cost a lot or people a lot or money at some point. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:04:51
I am using the same pattern but I see $3200 incoming before we see a recoil. The exchange closing in China will cause more downward pressure than people realize. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:49:54
That's why you should always do whatever someone that won Powerball did. Cause since they got rich, you will also?

Absolutely not even close, no matter your personal opinion on Roger Ver, he still knows far more about the workings of Bitcoin than Trace.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:25:11
Not a bad time to close up for a bit and relax. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:40:50
Roger (and Trace) both understand the surface of Bitcoin, they simply have different views on what the "end game" of Bitcoin is or should be. 
There is no "right or wrong" in Bitcoin. Period. 
They are also neither developers or low level technologists. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:14:27
There is nothing calculated about the risk in investing in crypto. Pretending that it's a calculated risk is just easy because crypto is in a bull market. Ask someone that bought Bitcoin ar $1100 if it was a good idea when it hits $200 in 2015. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:23:02
Again. Not doing so well there. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:25:11
