Normies tend to criticise bitcoin by citing the tulip mania bubble in the netherlands back in the 1600s.
They believe it's similar and that bitcoin will meet the same end. Unfortunately, tulip mania is not the same as the mania we're seeing for bitcoin and high market-cap alts because the technology, whilst in its infancy is real.

@_date: 2018-01-15 03:07:33
Not low fees, block sizes...
If nodes can't stay connected to the network, how will users participate in consensus? I'm barely OK with running my full node on ~4mb blocks every 10mins...

@_date: 2018-01-08 11:49:11
This. 
When storage is cheaper, people will just make more transactions. Even with more efficient use of block space, it will just make more room for more transactions.
We're going to need to go off the chain if we need to scale.

Tldr; It was a proposal to the scaling solution by increasing the block size. It had little to no developer support (but a lot of mining support). The fork was abandoned by its creators... and because of bugs in the code nodes running it around the fork date stopped working altogether.

Excellent point Ogre. You probably should ask someone smarter than I am.
I did some reading up on it when I held 30% Ethereum. AFAIK it only becomes a problem during a contentious fork, because there's no downside to signing every fork because it costs nothing to stake on separate chains.

Yah, because they need segwit for the malleability bug fix, LN was always 6months from implementing segwit. 
Since it's on mainnet and segwit was just implemented in August, I'd say that was pretty accurate.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:52:50
True... I think blocks will eventually scale bigger than my shitty internet connection can handle.
Here's hoping the wonderful developers working to improve bitcoin can help it scale as efficiently as possible until such a time. We all know where bad code gets bitcoin scaling. I probably would have gone with the flow if 2X had consensus/dev support.

Bitcoin is a more stable, proven blockchain. But Ethereum contacts allow you to write turing complete code. More flexibility and more attack vectors. I'm betting there's a space for both of them.

Funny thing about controlled experiments... they're very dependent on the execution. You could have all the well-intentioned crypto donors in the world, but if they use a checkout with bad UX for BTC, is that a reflection of bitcoin being bad or the terrible checkout UX?
Case in point: Wikimedia are using BitPay and asking for loads of personal info. Fuck that!
We're experimenting with BTC Pay Server at work at the moment, in the hope that we can convince some of our clients to experiment with BTC as a payment method. Building a smooth UX for crypto users is absolutely critical. 
Nicolas Dorier and the BTC Pay server dudes have made Bitpay obsolete. I hope Wikimedia re-tests with a better UX like this.

Merchants should charge fewer fees for BTC txns because:

Well for commodities you have silver/oil/platinum/etc serving different purposes. Same with crypto, but bitcoin is considered to be the "gold standard" of the space.


It's a nascent tech - expect people to struggle to grasp it for a while - Hell... people STILL laugh at bitcoin :P. We're all a bunch of nerds trading magical internet money... When it hits mainstream adoption, expect resources from governments and respected individuals in communities to ensure regular people don't get burned.
The way I do it now, I consider the developers to be the stewards of a coin. After spending countless hours getting to know the quality of the code and developers behind the project I make my decision.
I choose the coin with the most responsible stewards who are going to protect my savings and not fuck it up (e.g. pump and dump schemes or smart contract hacks that you see in other coins).


Bitcoin only has value because people have come together and agreed to give it value. I'm happy to buy and sell bitcoin at an agreed upon price set by the market - billions of dollars confirm this every day for me.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:43:27

We soft forked to segwit which increases the block size up to 1.7mb. But not easy to upgrade the block more without getting consensus.

True... But now that we've seen Bitcoin weather a variety of attack vectors __just this year alone__:
 - Bitcoin Unlimited bug in March
 - China exchange bans
 - UASF activation of Segwit
 - BCash uneventful fork
 - 2X bluff with 90% hash rate "support"
 - Ongoing mempool spam attacks
History is on our side and it may account for less drama / politics when users can look to previous hijack attempts and how they pan out.

Worries me too. We need the tech to mature before the herd gets here as well. Let it get established before the big banks know how to counter it.

That's why you replenish your spent bitcoins when you can.
It's also one of the reasons people don't pay for things in gold. Of course with gold, it's not as easy to verify the purity / divide gold into small amounts to pay for a coffee.
It's the polar opposite of the dollar - USD/fiat declines in value because they print more. People spend it because they know it's going to be worth less in 12 months time. Bitcoin on the other hand was designed to mimic gold mining that gets increasingly difficult over time and is a finite resource.

You should run a controlled experiment rather than asking opinions from a well-versed group of Bitcoiners in Reddit (likely bias). Let the market vote with their feet rather than with the voices of a loud few.
I can see Google Analytics setup on the site - that's about all you need for testing.

It's an interesting read.
I tend to agree medium of exchange is important for Bitcoin. Without it, users exchanging smaller amounts may choose to transact on other chains like Ethereum or litecoin.
Curious to hear your thoughts on how we quantify TPS as transactions are increasingly batched or performed off-chain through multisig wallets. If large institutions are regularly transacting with one another, wouldn't that be the perfect opportunity to conduct business off chain, (e.g. for privacy and avoiding transaction fees)?
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:08:25

They could merge the change and stay in power but they won't.
Core wants to make on chain transactions as efficient as possible before pursuing hard forks that centralise the network further.

Outputs per transaction is growing likely due to more exchanges batching their transactions up into a single transaction. This uses space more efficiently on the block chain, allowing each block to carry even more economic activity.
In short, we are witnessing the bitcoin ecosystem optimise the use of blockspace!
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:40:49

If block size is the way forward, maybe Bitcoin Cash is what you're after.
However, look at the consensus among individual developers, you'll see they're in favour of minimizing centralizing factors, such as increasing the block size. AFAIK, most people buy bitcoin because it's hard to coopt and a store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:49:24


Yes - and I don't like that either. But this isn't a reason to further centralise through larger blocks thoguh...

@_date: 2017-10-05 05:53:10
Let them carry on thinking so...
They will train countless devs in "blockchain technology", ultimately bringing more developers into this exciting crypto space.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:14:24
Good call... 
BCH supporters will want to support S2X, creating more downward pressure on BCH after the fork.
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:47:05
Thanks for including a source!
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:01:47
Miners **advertise** their support for protocol changes... it's just a proxy developers can use to determine consensus in the network.
Ultimately, it's up to developers to create a protocol that best serves users and the network.
EDIT: spelling
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:38:29
Haha true... perhaps Satoshi never envisioned miners coming together and agreeing to something without the rest of the network's support.
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:16:22
So tired of bcash... why are people still talking about it?
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:11:54
That's right. All senior executives are honest samaritans.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:54:38
I know it's not likely... but we have to stay vigilant and not underestimate the vitriolic companies forcing their altcoin down our throats.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:34:43
I know right... I bet this guy is besties with Xi Jinping on WeChat.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:51:45
YMMV... in Australia at least you're not required to report gains if you exchange crypto directly for goods/services as long as you bought it under $10K AUD. 
Not sure if it refers to the price of a satoshi or a full BTC though.
See under "Personal transactions":
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:43:19
Unless you're on windows.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:57:17
...and for 0.5 BTC you can!
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:31:42
Who the fuck is spending 251sat/byte!?!
They're just throwing money away...
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:30:27
Sweet Jesus.... $1100 per Bcash.
Goes to show you can make a killing of you dump this shitcoin early.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:45:16
Wait till they find out it's an "S-Curve" and they're buying it at 20k next year.
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:16:41
RemindMe! 3 years
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:50:50


Damn... the devs behind it stopped supporting it a while ago (read here:  ). I seriously hope you're not out of pocket for it...
May want to look into Samurai Wallet or if you're desperate, Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:33:02
Wonder if there will be BCH-S2X trading pairs??? ;)
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:46:36
OK... please sell me your BTC for my S2X. :D
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:27:53
Aka. Last place to get nuked.
Couldn't wish to move to a better place to avoid the apocalypse.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:15:54
Funnily enough, that's exactly what the other sub would say.
As a reader of both subs, my thoughts are definitely aligned with @_date: 2017-10-22 06:05:51
I'm doing us a favour not using home internet. Australian ISPs are notoriously slow (15/1 down/up).
My nodes are hosted in Google Cloud and Digital Ocean (only pay $50/m for DO as Google offers free credit for a while). They have ultra low latency connections with ludicrous amounts of bandwidth. The network needs high throughput nodes like this to relay valid blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:57:36
1 is in Digital Ocean which is expensive for the extra storage space.
The other three I run are all free on Google Cloud... for now :P
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:02:02
Doesn't that alt coin use both of those tickers?
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:34:26
Fine for you but I prefer sending my private key to HTTP sites in plain text.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:15:11
Hey... Hackers have mouths to feed too.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:46:25
Yes... it's the BDSMcoin subreddit.
They enjoy being dominated.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:47:34
Possibly... I wonder if that's something the devs have considered. If not could make for an interesting BIP.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:14:18
You and I have a vast choice of alt coins to choose, each with developers competing for marketshare. But only Bitcoin attracts the worlds best developers and multiple teams working to make it better.
Also, I just don't trust developers like Fake Satoshi and Jeff Garzik who are implementing this hard fork without replay protection. That's just evil.
How do you feel about possibly losing funds on the network when transacting around the hard fork?
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:33:14
Plural - Ftfy.
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:59:01
I take it you subscribe to the labour theory of value?
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:19:07
I used to think it was overkill calling it an attack too, until they made replay protection opt in and are disguising their nodes as legitimate core nodes.
It's a dirty fork.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:22:35
But this is kind of a new feature. You'd want to be thoroughly sure it works before you deposit any meaningful amount of funds in. Test it with a dust transaction first.
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:43:20
Must be the sex toy the snake is wrapping itself around

P2SH addresses
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:33:44
It's just a risky upgrade without any urgent need.
Mempool's empty.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:24:15
Better than btrash!
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:35:18
They're not contradictory. Both fire Core.
Thankfully people are waking up to the madness of big blockers and taking their money. Bitcoin will be stronger after 2X fails.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:24:16
As funny as it is, Nocoiner is a shit term.
It doesn't encourage salty people without any Bitcoin to buy some.
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:37:51
\*\*Begins fapping\*\*
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:29:41

@_date: 2017-10-08 20:38:33
I thought they opposed censorship?
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:06:31
It's weird... I almost feel like I need to drum up interest in the 2X shitcoin so I can take a sweet dump on it with my BTC afterwards.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:15:03
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:25:39
Unless OPs landlord wants his rent in BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:00:40
He didn't mention base currency - just bitstamp.
Could be USD/EUR right?
Edit: Reading Bitstamp
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:58:31
One small thing...
"Segwit2x" is not implemented or supported by the core devs. It's an attack on the network.
"Segwit" on the other hand is simply an upgrade that makes certain transactions smaller, allowing more transactions in each block. It's a much more efficient use of space and prevents a terrible bug known as transaction malleability.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:44:10
Can confirm... he emailed me today asking if he could deposit 10,000 BTC in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:31:32
Look too consensus amongst individual developers. Don't trust centralised authorities.
You can follow them on Twitter or better yet, watch GitHub for debates.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:11:35
This guy understands.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:21:03
Lots of people cashing out to buy lambos.

bBut mah bcash! /s
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:12:46
Holy shit... I can't upvote this enough!
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:23:19
My analogy is pretty shakey but the point I was trying to make is that people think miner votes are all you need for consensus.
But at the end of the day the value in the network only exists by virtue of its users. Developers need to build the best possible decentralised currency possible...
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:47:56
There's a difference between truth and fake news.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:36:43

Do you mean you will take my B2X? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:31:52

Cool username - antihistamines? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 07:43:10
As we saw with Bcash, miners follow profitability: 
So Miners will only support S2X if they can profit from it.
@_date: 2018-07-31 04:57:06
At least dicks can think for you sometimes...
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:29:36
As a full node operator, it's currently costing me $50/month to run one. Data centre costs are expensive.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:19:01
Wish the community was a little more welcoming at times... It's clear you're just trying to understand.
The Andreas videos are a great resource if you have the time.
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:40:57
Should email them... I have.
More people asking, the more exchanges need to pay attention.
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:17:28
Of course miners support bigger blocks... increasing latency to relay larger blocks through the network incentivises miners to be geographically centralised. Have you read this paper/discussion?:
Also why do you think S2X has so few developers?
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:47:11
Thank you, sir.
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:58:05
He's being sarcastic obviously... 
After the fall in prices, we can't afford lambos for now.
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:13:24
Perhaps OP lost a bet on Reddit and had to eat him.
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:45:27
Hahah been there, done that.
Those guys are still clinging to that dead cat.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:32:58
I wonder how low Bcash has to go for miners on the Bitcoin chain to attack the Bcash one.
Hell, I'd pay to watch such a historic moment.
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:55:36
To then sell at 2018 lows?
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:53:52
Yah... better it hit 900-950K if you want to see the event.
Allow for some wide spreads.
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:45:09
Furry muff :D

@_date: 2018-04-25 05:35:14
Think about it... He has more money than he can  spend.
He's trying to capture something far more valuable... Control over the Bitcoin brand and ecosystem. Why does he fuck with everyone else's livelihood without risking his own?
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:04:06
Less so than credit fuelled assets.
What percentage of stocks and mortgages are purchased on credit? Compare that to the percentage of crypto bought on credit.

My goal is to earn 6 figures too, in satoshis.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:16:54
On average it's easier to bribe people with less cash.
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:53:56
As long as said attackers are not the miners themselves. If you can earn more by spamming the network, that gives them an incentive.
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:24:49
Why not?
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:54:27
Why not 1, 2.1, 10, 21, 100, 210...?
Step 3 is still somewhat attainable if BTC stays under 10K.
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:37:31
... if it were $1M, you could just take the remaining 85% of your worth and employ everyone you know in well paying jobs /s
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:11:29
Cheap handjobs in the area though. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:05:41
It tries... But no.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:02:28
Think we're edging into panic now... That 3k will break to sub 2k for actual capitulation.
Just unusual this bear market that we don't have a goxxing...

I'd converted it into USD at the time. AFAIK USD wasn't able to be claimed back... just BTC. Please tell me I'm not wrong :(

I gave up after losing money on Mt gox. 
I lost 5 BTC all up and only just got into Bitcoin at the start of this year. Glad I'm still early...
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:00:03
How do you purchase it? Earning directly? Exchange? P2P? Can you discuss it on Wechat?
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:33:42
Capital gains tax on this when the new owner attempts to sell this at a higher price will be absolutely brutal!
Selling for 1 satoshi is a 1000x gain!
