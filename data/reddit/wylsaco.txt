I live in Russia. And yesterday an online friend from India who have not written me for a few years sent me a message, because he remember how I tried to talk about Bitcoin few years ago.
So this is that moments when you repeat the words of Morpheous from Matrix "you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I have spent my entire life looking for you" :)
I have helped him not only by sending 500 rupies, but also by teaching him how to use LocalBitcoins for wire transfers over their ISBN bank which is handy, because all other ways of Bitcoin exchange is too complicated.
I don't know why most of you think only inside of the box (only inside Silicon Valley and PayPal) and many of people here are not really wishing to see further than your cozy coinbase or whatever cozy circle account.
Look around: Russian segment of LocalBitcoins is estimates around 300 million rubles weekly - all of these direct, residual payments of those people who sent money to each other, and traders who most often are not lazy to handle even transactions like $5 for coffee manually (I use such small transactions on a daily basis myself).
Not Bitcoin itself brings such convenience to people living in country. Integrating "ISBN bank" (or any other third-world bank) which Indians used for decades - is the way to bring confidence to people. Yes they will use old methods, and yes they will rely on centralized escrow of LocalBitcoins. But hell they don't have other ways to bootstrap. They can't create things like coinbase just from day 0 which is where they are at 2017. We better create more P2P products, and not only rely on LocalBitcoins.
