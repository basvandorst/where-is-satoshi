If it is Mt Gox, you can file a claim and get your coins back.

Unfortunately people aren't that nice especially in the crypto community. Most people are here for selfish gains and wouldn't give you a dime. I personally would  love to help if I could. I hope you do find someone who can help you out.

Giving him a good beating
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:00:35
Yea, they're okay. Some even charge up to 20%, so I think you're getting a good deal.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:58:12
not possible.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:06:38
There are alot of reddit reviews about them.

I agree, he doesn't need the attention, he's a fucking retard.

I tried sending it to electrum but the fee was $18. That's alot, so I'm waiting to see if it goes down later.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:42:26

@_date: 2018-02-22 19:35:11

What have you tried so far?
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:53:33
To get your bitcoin addresses via bitcoin core console for your main account, use:
getaccountaddress ""
That will return your first address of the main account, and:
getaddressesbyaccount ""
Will return (at first launch two addresses and in general) the list of all your addresses associated with your main account.

Then it's still encrypted and you probably used the wrong password.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:27:49
Depends on what the text looks like 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:26:41
Then there are probably no coins there.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:06:05
Check the list if addresses and try them on blockchain.info 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:25:16
Try this tool 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:14:56
Did you use space when creating the password or they're all joined together?
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:00:16
You tried a professional recovery service?
