The difference is that "mining bitcoin" is a euphemism that doesn't completely describe what your computer is doing.
Your computer is finding a number which, when combined with a set of network transactions and hashed, will produce a sufficient run of zeros. You submit your solution to the network, and each node then agrees to add 25BTC to your address in their copy of the blockchain.
You're not finding bitcoins and confirming them on the network, you're finding nonces and then receiving a reward by consensus of the network.
If you're mining under a pool (which you certainly are) then the case is even clearer.

On the products page, the announcement ticker looked to me like a really ugly ad banner. I just skipped over it until I took a moment to ask why you would have advertising in such a chintzy place, and then I saw its actual function.

This is the most concise, neutral description of Bitcoin that I've seen:


I'll be filing that away for later use.
I also appreciated the very nuanced description of hypothesis testing, as related through the metaphor of the police line-up. Excellent reporting from Forbes, irrespective of their conclusion.

The trading will happen off the blockchain and on the exchange's servers. Basically, if you hold BTC on the exchange and I hold USD on the exchange, we can agree to make a deal and that deal is recorded (within 30 microseconds) by the exchange. We might make several more deals over the course of the day.
Then when the trading ends and I want to take my BTC out of the exchange, the exchange sends me my BTC on the blockchain.

The '+' to create sell orders should go below the tab bar, not above, imho. I understand that there is extra space up there, but options revealed by tab selection generally go below the tabs.
