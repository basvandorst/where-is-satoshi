The price isn't directly affected by news of the "destruction" of coins.  But it is affected by the buying/selling activities of the holder who lost their coins.  Essentially, those coins have been transferred into the "not for sale at any price" category.
If the holder needs to buy more bitcoins to replace those, then the price will go up from his/her purchases.
In any event the market will be higher at some point compared to the alternate universe in which those coins were eventually offered for sale.

If I **knew** bitcoin would go down to 1-3k, I would certainly sell it.  But I only **think** it will (or at least 3-5k).  I'm also fairly certain we'll see 50k, but it might take a few years.

Yeah, best to prepare yourself for a lot worse than that.  When it got near 14k a week or two ago, it then lost 14% in less than two minutes, and proceeded to slump below 10k.  Now we're back in the 12-13k range.   That's the bitcoin rollercoaster.

Lightning Network accomplishes a piece of that.  You have to set up the relationship online in advance, and check online periodically to see that you aren't being cheated, but individual transactions on a single channel themselves don't need a network connection, and could theoretically be done by scanning QR codes or with NFC.
It works because you aren't moving bitcoin directly, but rather giving and receiving the ability to redeem bitcoin from the blockchain at a later date.
That's in theory.  In practice LN uses a network connection for transactions to be able to route through multiple channels.

An address is a hash of a public key.  A public key is used for receiving BTC.
Every private key has a corresponding public key.  Together, they are called a "keypair".  This is a common cryptography concept, not specific to bitcoin.
Only you (and your wallet software) ever see the private key.  Knowledge of the private key is synonymous with ownership of the bitcoins.  You need the private key to prove you own the bitcoins in order to spend them.
How many addresses you use is between you and your wallet software.  Some wallets reuse the same addresses over and over, which can be simpler to manage.  Others use a new address for every transaction, which can make it harder to identify your transactions publicly, increasing your privacy.
Addresses are pretty much disposable, because it is so easy to make new ones.
So long as you still have the private key for an address, you can still use it to send funds, so you can still receive bitcoins at that address.  If you lose the private key, DO NOT receive any more bitcoins at that address: they would be lost.
BTW, your questions aren't stupid.  One drawback to Bitcoin is there is a learning curve to some of this.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:43:32
No, and no.
Most nodes have no mining activity associated with them.  There are a small number of mining nodes controlled by the major mining pool operators that supply the vast majority of the hashrate.
Regardless of that, unlimited blocksize doesn't guarantee any more fees, because many transactions have no fee associated with them, so the miners are not impressed.
One major pushback against a larger blocksize is that it will encourage more "spammy" transactions on the blockchain that provide no fees and little value to Bitcoin as a whole, but increase costs for miners and everyone else who wants to run a full node.


Yes, that is an issue, which is why we are talking about increasing the blocksize.  Some see 20MB as a step towards a much more capable blockchain.  (Edit:  in case you thought differently, the current blocksize limit is 1MB, so 20MB is an increase)
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:08:59
IMO, Most of the "nay"-sayers seem to state that the blocksize can and should be increased relatively quickly (I assume they mean a few weeks' notice), but only in response to a current crisis.  There also seem to be a number of participants who believe that there will be no genuine crisis, because there are lots of "spammy" transactions on the blockchain from a relatively small number of participants that would go away if they had to pay a slight fee.

Maybe because great inventions are often revolutionary, i.e. disruptive to the status quo.  If you disturb the status quo, you can expect resistance of some form or other.  
In this case, Bitcoin is a revolution in money, the cornerstone of power in the modern age.  Anyone involved can expect resistance if they are merely perceived as being central to Bitcoin.
I, for one, fully expect the current "experimental" legislative attitude toward Bitcoin to give way to outright bans, should the market cap increase significantly (like say, $1 trillion).

* The bulk of the hashpower added to bitcoin this month is from a single entity
* The Bitcoin Cash network would not be able to respond to a 51% attack by quickly blacklisting a block that builds on an older block and omits a valid transaction.  This would be a manual process, but is totally doable, precisely because the BCH ecosystem is so centralized.

Theoretically, it (a government takeover of mining) could be done through the mining pools, if you have enough coordination among governments.  The idea is to quickly take control over the servers of mining pools representing a significant majority of the hashrate, and force a consensus rule change that essentially requires the government's permission to author a block (like an officially signed certificate or some such thing).
That would outright ban non-sanctioned mining pools and solo miners, regardless of VPNs or Tor.  Of course, the immediate reaction would be a "free" fork, but if governments are coordinated and committed enough to this course of action, they will also require exchanges to continue listing the "official" bitcoin as BTC.
Once government has control over the miners, they control who can and cannot transact, and can make consensus changes at will.  (Perhaps this is how the [mark of the beast]( will be enforced).
Bitcoin is protected by nationalism.

I mean, they've let you trade one risk for another.  Before, you had the risk that BTC would go up before you bought it, so you wouldn't get as much.  Now you have the risk that the BTC you bought will go down before you have a chance to spend it.
It depends on why you are buying, I suppose.  If you are speculating/investing, perhaps you want today's rate.  If you are buying a product with BTC, you probably want the BTC rate at the time you buy that product, not 4-5 days earlier, as most products' prices in BTC will be adjusted as BTC varies with respect to fiat.

So it looks cool, but I don't understand something about the security model...
What is to prevent an attacker from creating forgeries that look like opendime sticks, but don't actually have the private key?  They would just have the public key to a bitcoin address that the attacker controls.  Once he has the product/cash he bought with the forged stick, he goes home and transfers the BTC.
From their FAQ:
     With our newest hardware (V2), there is a dedicated
     anti-counterfeiting chip which holds a secret key
     assigned by the Opendime factory. We publish the
     matching public key, and so it's easy to verify that
     you have a genuine Opendime in your hands. Learn
     more by reading our technical white paper (link 
     coming soon) which details the cryptography 
     involved.
But, how can someone securely verify this key?  If you plug an untrusted USB stick into your computer, it can contain malware (google: badusb).  Then you can't trust whatever software you were going to use to verify the factory key.  If you give the attacker a message to sign with the factory key, he could spoof the signature using a separate genuine opendime stick with no value on it.  This all feels like a cat-and-mouse game, not real security.
I'd like to see that white paper.  When will it be available?  "soon".

Their difficulty will increase around 5AM Wednesday (UTC).  It will quadruple -- the maximum adjustment.

I've noticed this before, it's really fascinating.  But after thinking about it for a few years, I think the pattern will slow down and the ratio between tops will shrink.  Bitcoin will have to hit its maximum market penetration at some point.
EDIT: "Maximum market penetration" is relative to the current financial &amp; regulatory environment.  The US government is stifling growth here, and most people have no reason to jump through the required hoops to use Bitcoin.  In areas with more considerable financial uncertainty (failing banks), I'm not sure Bitcoin has enough of a reputation as a safe haven.  So the two main drivers of bitcoin adoption and price are quite limited currently.  I think the bubble in the last few weeks has been mainly speculative, in particular, which is why I expect a retracement to the low 800s.  But circumstances tend to change, and Bitcoin will probably still be around when they do.  In that case, the moon will really be in sight.  HODLing.

There is no "mining floor". 
1. Miners also speculate on future prices, and can sink funds into continuing mining that isn't immediately profitable today, if they believe it will go up again.
2. Those that can't afford to, or don't believe it will go up again, stop mining, and the difficulty adjusts, reducing the remaining miners' costs.
The constant is the emission rate.  That amount of bitcoin being produced every day (less whatever amount the miners hoard), needs to find a buyer.  If there aren't a lot of buyers some day, for whatever reason, mining pressure will drive the price down.
Just because miners need the price to be a certain level to be profitable, doesn't cause that price to happen.

Just one I can think of.  Some big whale for some reason hasn't played his cards yet, and decides to single-handedly raise the price of BCH to 1.2 or so BTC.  Then the miners defect to BCH en masse, and BTC is actually in trouble like the guys at keep saying it is.

Exponential functions are of the form C^(x).  C is still the constant.
So *e*^(mx+b) is exponential, but sqrt(x), which you correctly said is also x^(1/2), is a power function, not exponential.

The difficulty adjustments are hard to overcome.  They will tend to force the mean block time to 10 minutes, as designed.  Hash-rate will over time migrate to the more expensive coin.
So, unless they can push BCH's market price above 1.0 BTC, it is doomed.
BTC, for it's part, now has a 100MB mempool (with &gt;100BTC in fees), and it takes more than 400 sat/byte (~$3.50) to get in a block anytime soon.  Let's see how that progresses after the next retarget (~1d 11h from now) and how much hashrate comes back from the BCH chain.

I have two competing theories about Bitcoin's price action:
1. Bitcoin is overvalued right now.  Plotting a long-term support graph for bitcoin, I came up with a decent matching equation:  BTCUSD = 0.18 \* 2.0^0.32\*sqrt(T-7/18/2010).  It's just an empirical fit, but it fits well, it clearly highlights that bitcoin was in bubble territory 4 times in the past, and seems to have entered a fresh bubble earlier this year.  According to that equation, the support price is now just $1400 (and BTC will hit $1M around 2029).  NOTE:  I would not sell based on this "analysis", and I'm personally still HODLing.  The chances of seeing $1400 again are next to nil.
2. Bitcoin has been hampered by the scaling debate, causing investor and entrepreneur uncertainty.  Now that we are seeing concrete actions taken (on both sides of the debate), the possible outcomes are getting clearer.  Once we have a clear solution (hopefully in a few more months), malleability is addressed, and scalability is at least partly addressed with expectations of further improvements, those same entrepreneurs and investors are going to go ahead in ways that are positive for the bitcoin price, and we could be poised for some massive organic growth over the next 12-24 months.

A few days ago fees weren't nearly as high.  I went cheap and set a tx fee of .0001 ($0.40, ~44 sat/byte), my transaction took a couple of hours, but it went through.
Perhaps in a few days the current miner situation will resolve itself and we can clear out the backlog in the mempool.
However this is another major problem with Bitcoin in its current state, that fees can get to be so high.  Miners would love to clear out the transaction backlog and claim these fees, if they had the blockspace to do it in.  (The other major problem is that a fork is capable of stealing mining hashrate from the original chain, leading to an unstable situation in which hashrate sloshes back and forth between the chains.)

That page seems to have a contradiction.  At the top it says, "No chain split detected".  In the BitcoinABC Node it says, "This node's scheduled chain split has occurred".
I guess you could say that the time has come, but we haven't seen a block yet, but the BitcoinABC node is already rejecting other blocks, so we're detecting something already.  Give it a few hours, or a couple days and it won't matter though.
Last I heard we were expecting their first block to take ~16 hours, and the ABC client has code added to reduce the difficulty by 20% each block if the last 6 blocks took more than 12 hours.  So... it seems like it could be a few days before they get to the 1 block/hour rate.  How long from then until their first difficulty retarget, assuming constant hashrate?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:57:12
Now it looks like someone took a tactical 12-hour break to trigger a series of 20% difficulty adjustments downward (and probably mine BTC in the interim because time is money when you're mining).  BCH should be moving much more smoothly tomorrow morning.
Of course, once it's moving more smoothly and they're getting more than a block/hour, I assume some exchanges will actually allow deposits and/or withdrawals.
The real story comes tonight/tomorrow, because all of this is predicated on the market price of BCH.  If enough traders believe in it, it will survive.  If they don't really believe in it, it will die, quickly followed by the miners, and that will be that.

My trend line isn't exponential. It's a square root.
The "trend line" equation is:
0.018 \* 2^0.32*sqrt(X), where X is the number of days since 2010-07-18, the first day in my dataset.

If you hold your own private keys, you now have both BCC/BCH and BTC in the same amounts, at the same addresses.  Your BTC is on the BTC chain and your BCC is on the BCC chain.  You will need a wallet that supports BCC if you plan to transfer/trade/spend them.   
If your coins were in a wallet or exchange, you have to check with them as to whether they have credited you with BCC/BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:31:26
At this point BCH is being supported by whales with lots of fiat, BTC, hashpower, and maybe a couple of exchanges at their disposal.
This can continue until they decide to give up, or they get the price of BTC &gt; BCH.
However, the BCH chain didn't get as much hashpower in this cycle of the oscillation as it did last time.  Perhaps it will dampen out.  Perhaps miners aren't as confident in the future value of the coin they are mining.  "Future" as in 100 blocks in the future when they can claim it.

But since OP has already bought, and the price looks high (the ATH always does), best advice is HODL.  Bitcoin generally works out as a long-term investment, 2 years or more; don't worry about timing.
As for backups, make sure you have one in a trusted location that is not your house.  For instance, bank deposit box if you already have one, or a trustworthy relative's safe (if you have one).  If it's all in your house, you're vulnerable to all sorts of bad things that can happen to houses (fire/flood/tornado).
As for buying more and/or trading, the most valuable thing you will gain at first is experience.  Only spend what you are willing to lose, and don't be too hard on yourself if trades go bad, just try to analyze the experience when you aren't emotional, and learn from it.

This is what I did, moved my BTC last night.  Sent my BCH to an exchange this morning.  I used electron cash on Linux, running from Python source code, to make the deposit to the exchange.
There was one issue: electron cash somehow connected to a normal bitcoin server, and thought my BCH wallet was empty.  The fix was to delete the electron cash wallets and start over, selecting a known good server.  After that I made the one transaction I needed no problem.

Yeah, I was wrong about that.  And in a clear example of unintended side-effects (at least I think this was unintended), the EDA rule has altered another consensus rule: the inflation schedule.  The inflation schedule is predicated on the notion that the network will keep block times reasonably close to 10 minutes.  But the net effect of this oscillating difficulty is to decrease the mean block time to less than half of that.  That means BCH is creating coins faster than expected.
I would expect those coins have to go somewhere.  When they get released after 100 blocks (just 4 hours at the current rate), are the miners content to hold onto their BCH, or do they want BTC or fiat instead?  Assuming the 4x block-rate right now is creating additional sell-pressure on the BCH markets, where is the price support coming from?  If the price support is coming from the same whale(s) that started the huge movement on Aug 17th, then how deep are their pockets, and what is their pain point when they would give up?  If I were mining BCH, I'd be worried that the market could move against me quickly.
But then, I sold my all BCH for BTC, and in the back of my mind, I'm worried that the market could move against me the other way.

There is that sticky issue of replay protection.  A lot of exchanges said back in March that they wouldn't list any forks if they don't have replay protection.
And S2X doesn't want to add replay protection because it makes it look like they are forking off as an altcoin, and they want to just take over Bitcoin instead.  Getting listed as another token (like BC2X or something like that) on the exchanges is NOT what they want.
We're approaching this situation with 90% of hashpower advertising support for 2x, and &gt;90% of nodes running software that will reject it.  If the BCH fork is like chess, this is a game of chicken.

The problem is that the block-rate is highly variable (it's only the mean block rate that we try to force to 10 minutes), and you need to average more than 100 blocks to get a reliable signal of how much hash-power is active out there.
IMO, it would work to adjust difficulty every X days, instead of every 2016 blocks.  This might work with X as low as 2-3.  It would take some study to make sure that the known issues with block timing couldn't be exploited to game this rule.

In the case of a future fork, the "other cryptocurrency" and Bitcoin are presently on the same blockchain.  Also, OP's question is very relevant to current BTC holders who may be interested in trading or otherwise using the new token they will get for free.
We're presently in the middle of a different fork entirely which shows how the altcoins generated by such forks have direct impacts on Bitcoin.  I don't think it's a good idea to suppress discussion of those effects just because they are related to an altcoin.

I am not a lawyer either, but I've learned that laws can be construed as broadly as the language allows, so you need to pick your path through the "and"s and "or"s to see if there is any way it can be applied to your case.  If there is a way, a lawyer/prosecutor prosecutor will probably try.
In this case, I see "whoever impresses upon a currency of the United States any notice shall be fined under this title."  So, facially, the stamp is illegal.  The question is whether that can be upheld, or if the stamp is considered "protected speech".

EDIT:  I'm a bit late to the party.  Looks like BCH had more hashpower than I thought, and they already have some blocks mined.  The following discussion is inaccurate insofar is it concerns timings.
From my parsing of the code, I think BCH difficulty will get adjusted down 20% for their second block and all subsequent blocks until they get 6 blocks out in a 12-hour time period, which should get them roughly in the range of 1-hour blocks within a few days (assuming constant hashrate).  After that, it will be a while before their next retarget.
It's kind of like a soft launch.  
I think technically an exchange could credit their BTC holders with BCH and start trading now, but deposits and withdrawals won't be available for a couple days at least.  Are there any exchanges trading BCC or BCH yet?  I checked Kraken and they are not (they have buy orders but no sell orders, thus no trades).
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:55:30
Unless, as a miner, you have a slightly longer horizon and think that a lot of hash rate bouncing back and forth might not be good for the price of either chain.   As much as half of BTC's hash-rate may believe this, because for whatever reason, they didn't switch to BCH.

Alternate explanation: someone with a lot of hash power switched over temporarily to keep the 20% difficulty adjustment from happening, forcing BCH miners to mine a less profitable chain than BTC, because the difficulty won't adjust for up to 4 months at 2 hours/block.  (At the moment, BCH is at height 478570, and has 1472 blocks to go to the next retarget)

Go to [Johoe's mempool statistics]( (especially the bottom chart, "Mempool size in KB") and you'll understand better.  The appropriate fee depends on your tolerance for delays and risk, and the state of the mempool.  As of midnight UTC, the mempool is essentially empty, meaning many blocks clear all available transactions.  Put differently, when the mempool is empty, even a 1sat/byte transaction will get into a block with relatively low delays.
When the mempool is not empty, then you'll want to pick a higher transaction fee to be reasonably sure your transaction gets processed.
EDIT:  If you zoom out that chart to the 1-year time-scale, you can see how the mempool responds under various scenarios: 
Last August, it started piling up when Bitcoin Cash split off and took some hashpower with them, causing periods when the main Bitcoin network had lower hash-power than usual, and slower blocks.  That situation resolved itself after a month.  
In November and December, the price was rising rapidly, and the amount of network activity increased with it, causing a much larger backlog.  Segwit was activated at this point, allowing more transactions per block in theory, but it was not adopted fast enough to compensate for the extra demand.
On Dec 20, the mempool became "full", and the lowest-fee transactions started to get evicted (you have to be careful here, there could also be effects like this if Johoe's node got restarted).  In January, as the price started falling, there was apparently a lot of demand to move bitcoins to exchanges to sell them, resulting in all-time-high bitcoin transaction fees.
Since February, the frenzy seems to have died down, and the mempool quickly cleared out entirely.
So at Christmas time, I bought my family sushi dinner with BTC and paid ~$50 in fees, whereas now someone feels comfortable spending a $298 million dollar transaction output with only $.04 in fees.

What is "manipulation" anyway?  If the market is a social construct made up of a number of participants, then manipulation is the act of influencing other's actions for your own benefit.  It is certainly possible for those who control large sums of BTC to do this on existing markets, in large part because existing markets have such small order books.
One classic is a sell wall:  The BTC holder would like to sell some BTC and be reasonably guaranteed of being able to buy them back at a lower price, pocketing the difference.  So first he sells a bit of BTC, then he places a large limit sell order just above the asking price, and constantly adjusts it so that it doesn't actually get filled much.  In this way, he convinces other participants that the price is about to fall.  Some participants sell, some hold off on buying when they otherwise would have, and the market makers with buy orders either cancel them or adjust them to a lower price.  Once the price has fallen to the whale's liking (and he sees there is sufficient order depth above his sell wall), he cancels the remainder of the sell order and buys back hits BTC.
So yes, when individuals or small groups control sums of dollars or BTC which are relatively large compared to the order book, they can engage in various forms of manipulation.
My personal view is that the effects of such manipulation are largely temporary, and of no concern to the HODLer.

Crazy idea:  miners could identify themselves by signing something with the private keys of coinbase addresses in the last 144 or so blocks.  Of course, adjusting the block reward based on that, even if it was done in a way that didn't affect inflation, would give an advantage to larger pools over smaller ones, and I guess would lead to one central mining pool.
But signing in that way could indicate that a miner has been mining on one token consistently.   So perhaps there is some way to incentivize loyalty that avoids centralization?

I like your line of thinking, but spreading the payout among previous blocks won't help.  Any reward a disloyal miner loses when he switches to BTC from BCH, he will regain after he switches back to BCH, as he would continue to get BTC payouts for a period after he started mining BCH.
It seems like a difficult problem to incentivize loyalty, when every hash attempt is independent

Which in a roundabout way explains why there won't be a long-lived fork.
Assume there is a fork, and you have BTC from before it.  Now, if you can find a merchant accepting BTC from each side of the fork, you can spend your coins twice.
Now look at the merchant's perspective.  If you accept BTC during a fork, that transaction may not be recognized once the fork resolves, if you were on the wrong branch.  This is why, during previous forks, the bitcoin economy ground to a halt until it was resolved.  
Who resolved it?  The miners, by updating their software to the version they thought best, caused one side of the fork to die off while the other side of the fork went on as "Bitcoin".

The bulk of the data in a bitcoin block is cryptographic in nature: public keys and signatures.  Cryptographic data is incompressible, so you would only get any benefit from compressing the remaining data, which is quite small by comparison.

For now, I agree.  If bits do achieve anything like parity with dollars, though, I think terminology will change.  When I was first interested in Bitcoin (early 2013), it was just Bitcoin.  Then the price went up, a lot more people got involved, and I started to see mBTC showing up places, but that term never really took off.  Then around the 2014 boom I started to see "bits" being used, as again, the price was increasing and more people were getting involved.
So I anticipate that if the price increases again and more people get involved (both by a factor of at least 5-10), that we will see terminology changes again.

So if I wanted to keep bandwidth low on a full node, is there any way to restrict upload bandwidth to somewhere in the vicinity of 3x-4x download bandwidth?  My napkin math says that would result in 53kpbs average bandwidth, or 17.2GB/month, which seems reasonable to me.

It takes some time, some learning, and some coding, so time.
Time = money.
* T = the amount of time
* R = your hourly rate, a.k.a. opportunity cost of what else you could do with your time
So to be worthwhile, you need:
T\*R &gt;= 88000 * p1 * p2 * p3
* p1: probability that Bitcoin will drop below $2000
* p2: probability that will follow through
* p3: probability that your bot will win the race to create and post a transaction for his coins against the other bots
In my case, I estimate T\*R=$1,200, p1=0.2, p2=0.05, p3=0.1.  So I would spend $1,200 and expect to earn $132.  Not worth it, but you may make different assumptions.

The two most important words in the title are "if" and "could".  Otherwise it would likely be false.
Hyperbitcoinization would be a rough ride, to put it mildly.  The network isn't built to handle it yet under normal circumstances.  Governments and banks would be trying all-out to stop it, including attacking the network, stealing people's coins with NSA trojans, shutting down exchanges and confiscating both digital and fiat assets, dumping the digital assets when the markets are most illiquid, publishing the stories of people who lost their bitcoins (either genuine stories, bitcoin the NSA stole, or just made-up propaganda).  Trading bitcoin would be criminalized, subject to forfeiture of all the offender's assets.  Websites just talking about bitcoin would be shut down as criminal enterprises, much less any that facilitated trading.  I'm sure I cannot anticipate all the tactics that would be used.  Just thought of another one: confiscate more than 51% of the mining equipment, centralize control of who can transact.
Meanwhile the financial crisis that would erupt on the fiat side would resemble Venzuela.

When bitcoin mining started, you could win the bitcoin lottery and get 50 of them, just using your CPU.  They weren't worth much, of course.  Then came the GPU miners, and the CPU miners got left in the dust.  After that came the ASICs, which are more powerful than GPUs (and FPGAs) and are the main miners today.
Meanwhile, the rule built into bitcoin is that every 210,000 blocks (roughly 4 years) the reward gets cut in half.  This has happened twice so far, so the reward for finding a block is currently 12.5 BTC.  
In the CPU/GPU days, it became so hard to mine bitcoin that a solo miner might have to wait months to mine a block.  In that time, the difficulty would be expected to increase further, yielding the possibility that a solo miner wouldn't ever mine a block at all.  So mining pools were formed, where miners banded together to mine blocks, and split the proceeds based on how much hashpower they contributed.  By joining a mining pool, a miner converts a long-shot chance of mining a whole block into a steady stream of small payouts.

To be really sure a specimen is solid gold, you should perform 2-3 tests from the following:
1. Measure with digital calipers, compare to known coin dimensions and tolerances.
2. Specific gravity (density).  Easiest way is to suspend the specimen in a container of water on a scale.  The measured weight is the weight of the water displaced by the specimen.  Divide that into the weight of the specimen itself on a scale to get specific gravity.
3. Ultrasonic testing.  Ultrasonic sound waves passing through a specimen will reflect at the boundary layer between two metals.  In a pure sample, the sound waves will reflect at the far edge and return in a predictable amount of time.
4. Magnetism.  Gold is weakly diamagnetic and will repel a permanent magnet.  Tungsten and many other metals used for debasement are paramagnetic and will attract a permanent magnet.   Weigh the specimen on a scale and suspend a magnet over it.  Pure gold will repel the magnet and the weight reading will increase slightly.  Tungsten and many other metals will attract the magnet and the reading will decrease (and the decrease will be larger than the expected increase).
Those are the cheap non-destructive ways to test gold that I am aware of.

You're close.  But long positions are not like buying bitcoin outright.  These are margin longs.  They borrow money to buy bitcoin, while keeping perhaps 10% of margin with the exchange.   If bitcoin goes up, they sell it, repay what they borrowed, and profit.  If bitcoin goes down, the exchange sells it for them and the margin goes to pay the balance of what they owe, and they are left with nothing.  If the price moves especially violently and the exchange is unable to liquidate them in time, then they could be left owing money to the exchange.

Tungsten is paramagnetic while gold is diamagnetic, so you can tell the difference with a postage scale and a rare-earth magnet (it needs to be relatively strong, an electromagnet may work as well).
1. Place the gold bar on the scale and take a reading
2. Position the magnet above the bar (a plastic cover above the gold bar is useful to keep the magnet steady, but the magnet must not be resting on the scale)
If the reading on the scale increases slightly, the metal is diamagnetic (repels the magnet) and it's gold.
If it has a tungsten core, the reading will instead decrease significantly, because the tungsten core attracts the magnet much more than the gold shell repels it.

Crumpled.  ("The likely 'hood' of a complete crash")
For Bitcoin to go to 0, There are three possibilities I can think of.  The first one is that governments and banks might successfully stamp it out completely, putting HODLers in jail and cutting them off from the internet, etc. (And this would have to be a coordinated global effort, because any country that doesn't participate becomes the center of Bitcoin).
A second option is that the security of Bitcoin is broken, and it doesn't store value anymore (because it could be trivially stolen).  If this were to happen quickly, there may not be time to react and improve the protocol and consensus rules before Bitcoin dies as a currency.
The third possibility is that something undeniably better comes along: more private, more scalable, more convenient.
So to sum it up, not very likely.  Simple market dynamics won't and can't drive bitcoin to 0, because there are people who find value in bitcoin separate from any exchange.  Satoshi selling all his coins at once could crash the market almost arbitrarily low, but eventually people would buy them all and the price would begin to recover.

Gavin,  I might be missing something, but Peter Todd's math looks wrong to me.  His 29.2% number is the hash power required to cause the other miners on the network to have more orphaned blocks than the selfish miner, but that doesn't mean the selfish miner will have more than his fair share of blocks on the main chain.  In order to achieve that, a miner with a hash rate of Q would need to cause other miners to orphan (1-Q)/Q blocks for every one that the selfish miner orphaned.  That doesn't look possible with selfish mining until you have &gt; 50% of the hashpower.
I ran a simulation, and a selfish miner with 35% of the hash power only got about 28% of the blocks.  [Code is here](

You're welcome to try, but in previous bubbles, there were bumps in the road that, at the time, looked an awful lot like the bubble had burst already.  When the price recovered, anyone who sold in those dips was very tempted to buy again, but at a higher price, so as not to miss further action.
I did a lot of that and burned through a few coins back in 2012.  I became a believer in HODL after that.
I find it's best to remember that after the bubble pops, it will most likely recover, even if it takes a few years.  Patience pays off, just keep your keys safe.
You could also try to believe fervently, if you sell at $4000 and the price is now $6000, that it's a bubble and it will eventually pop, but I found that strategy harder.

Before that I seem to remember a bubble that popped at $243, before that was it $31?
This price can go up quite a while from here, but I think we're definitely in bubble territory again.
OTOH, the scaling news from yesterday could be really big.  The prolonged scaling debate and the high fees from full blocks were putting a damper on the price by blocking some use cases.  Any resolution of that, regardless if it's the best or not, is going to be bullish.

Honestly, I'd prefer trading with a local gold dealer, buying 1 or 2 oz. of gold at a time.

I've heard this stated a few times (incl by luke-jr) and I'm confused by it:


This seems to envision a battle between two chains of similar hash power over a significant duration (&gt;6 blocks, maybe?)
In this case, there is a possibility that the BIP148 chain goes from being shorter than the legacy chain to longer than it, at which point the legacy chain would accept it as the longest chain, rejecting any non-segwit blocks on the legacy chain in the process.
This just doesn't seem like a big deal to me, it should be resolved in a matter of hours, although I expect some uncertainty could linger for several days.  At 10-20% hashrate, the BIP-148 chain would fall so far behind in the first few hours as to make catching up effectively impossible.  At a 40-60% split, it would take longer to decide a clear winner.
The users of the legacy chain, if they believe in their cause, could adopt a new consensus rule of their own to block accepting a longer BIP-148 chain.  If we are approaching Aug. 1, and there appears to be comparable hash-power on each side, I imagine some version of software would be available for that.  If a miner wants to oppose BIP-148 for whatever reason, they would use such a feature if it were made available.  If it were my miner (and I were opposed to BIP-148), I would take whatever steps were available to prevent building off of the BIP-148 chain.  So, I think it's reasonable to expect that some portion of the legacy chain would not be susceptible to accepting any blocks from the BIP-148 chain.
But, this is all about a UASF, not a mining majority, right?  I thought the object was to incentivise the miners to adopt SegWit, because if they don't, nobody will want the legacy coins they've mined?  That's a whole separate ballgame.  If there is a significant possibility of a fork, some major exchanges will prepare to trade the two sides of the fork separately.  The BIP-148 chain could persist and even prevail in this case with an initial minority of the hashrate:  If people vote with their coins on the exchanges, and the price of the BIP-148 coin is greater than legacy coins, miners will switch out of self-interest.  
Then the real competition for legitimacy is with both the miners and the traders/users.
All in all, it's a messy situation, but it certainly doesn't seem to me that the risk is all confined to one side of the split.

You *should* be OK, so long as coinbase stays solvent.
If BCC doesnt get any more support, their chain won't be significant, and I'd wager you will be able to withdraw your coins as if nothing had happened.
Bad scenario  BCC becomes a major chain split (or even the dominant chain) and coinbase needs to suspend withdrawals for a while to work things out.
Bad scenario  Coinbase may not have enough BTC to support all the withdrawal activity going on in advance of Aug 1, and they go bankrupt.  I don't think this is likely.  Coinbase is a big player, and we would be seeing other smaller, less reputable wallets and exchanges having trouble first.

You made me waste a couple of hours googling about nuclear alchemy (but oh the things I learned).  Someone made minute amounts of gold from mercury, and it seems possible to make gold from tungsten and a high-flux slow neutron source.  You'd want a good shield for gamma rays and the chemical means to separate gold from all the other elements you are going to end up with, and some of the half-lives on the way up the chain are on the order of months, but it should be possible.  
The problem is commercial neutron sources have a flux of like 100,000/s, and at that rate, you end up making a millionth of a penny in a year (I'm not exaggerating, Avagadro's number is just huge).  To make real money, you would need a flux of about a trillion times that, or 10\^17 n/s, which means you need a nuclear reactor.  While those certainly exist, it's not worth it to build one just to make a few oz of gold each month.
Also, I'm not a nuclear scientist, so I may have missed something which makes this impossible, but it sure seems like if you start with tungsten and keep adding neutrons and/or waiting for beta decay, you can end up at gold.  One other trick is you need to end up at Au\^197, which is the only stable isotope of gold, and you want to be careful not to go past it and get Mercury.

That legitimately sounds awesome.  I have two questions:
1) How do you pay off your CC with BTC?  Did you find a bank that lets you do this, or do you sell on an exchange, transfer to your checking account, and pay the CC?
2) Who does your taxes?

I left my front door open, and nobody has stolen my TV yet!
Let me add my voice to exhort you to not leave RPC ports open to the world.  By doing so, you are exposing an attack surface unnecessarily.  Any remote code execution vulnerability found in the RPC API will lead to your node getting pwned.  Use a VPN, or at least an SSH tunnel.

You seem to be thinking from the cashier's perspective.  From the business owner's perspective, he/she certainly knows that gold is valuable, and would accept it if enough people wanted to pay with it, but since almost nobody does and it costs money to be able to verify it, and time to actually verify it, it's not worth it to accept gold as a form of payment.
With bitcoin, there's still a lot of (healthy) skepticism that it will continue to be worth anything at all in the future.  I expect this to decline more rapidly in the next few years than it has in the past, as more people have been aware of bitcoin since before the late-2017 bubble, and therefore have seen firsthand that bitcoin doesn't go away when its bubble pops.

Also did it.  Just want to point out that one question asks which cryptos do you own, but only allows to select one choice.
Please post your results when you can.

I would expect merchant adoption to be mostly dependent on exchange support.    So how long do you think until exchanges would support LN for deposits and withdrawls?

Just google for "howto program a reddit bot".  When I did that, I learned that Reddit provides a REST/json API, and found tutorials mostly centered on Python.  You will need to be able to generate private keys from a Trezor recovery seed.  Maybe they use BIP39, but otherwise you'll have to DYOR there.  The Electrum client is written in Python, so you can probably use it to stay connected to the Bitcoin network and broadcast a transaction.   You only need to share public keys with the Electrum client.
Once you get the Python for all that together, you just need a server to run it on, pinging away at Reddit looking for Trezor seeds.

... And as soon as they have it all, they declare that the price just went up.  I couldn't make it up if I tried.  History is sad.

I beg to differ on a few points:
* Storage, transferability, and shipping are three different things.  You can pay someone to warehouse your gold for you, and you can pay someone to warehouse your bitcoin.  For transferability, they are also equal.  Bitcoin obviously wins at shipping.
* Gold is not borderless.  Just try crossing a border with it and see.
* Gold has faster value transfer than bitcoin.  I can hand over a gold coin faster than you can get out your phone and show me an address to send bitcoin to.
* Bitcoin is more easily verifiable than gold.  To spot gold fakes you need a scale, probably a magnet, maybe a pair of digital calipers or an ultrasonic tester.  Those are the cheap options.  With bitcoin all you need to do is wait for a confirmation or two.
* The government is about as able to confiscate bitcoin as it is able to confiscate gold.  That is, you can hide/protect gold about as well as you can protect your bitcoin private keys.
Then there is one last small point to make:
* Accepted as valuable by &gt;90% of the world's population for thousands of years:  Gold.    Bitcoin is accepted as valuable by enough market participants to be useful, but given the price volatility in response to regulatory news or exchange hacks, gold is still by far the safer investment.
Mind you, I personally prefer BTC to gold, because the upside is so much higher, and I'm a techie by nature.  But don't diss the original.

I assume there's no possibility of these being profitable for the miner unless he/she is assuming a large increase in the price of bitcoin.  These cards are being marketed to prevent the demand disruptions in more expensive cards that are actually useful for playing games.

It's a serious question.  On the one hand, my magic internet money isn't doing me any good until I sell it.  On the other hand, I don't want to be left behind while it goes to the moon.  
I think I have a compromise:  Set a goal for what you would like to buy with the proceeds from selling bitcoin (or with bitcoin directly) that would make your life tangibly better.  Then choose the portion of your bitcoin you wouldn't mind having parted with if the price were to reach $1/satoshi.  When that amount of BTC can buy the thing you want, sell/spend it, and HODL the rest.
Then, if BTC goes to 0, it has already improved your life.  If it goes to the moon, you're rich.  If it goes to 0 before you sell, oh well, maybe you were too greedy.

Ok, thanks for the clarification.

I stopped at, "No, all the other currencies are very volatile...".  It was complete with waving hands.
I've heard that one before, but the price of food, clothes, rent, gas, gold, etc. in terms of USD didn't spike 6x last year then drop 2x this year.  It's pretty easy to pick out the asset with the volatile price.
Instead of saying bitcoin isn't volatile, we should be saying, "of course it's volatile, the markets haven't discovered its price yet."

This is my introduction to side-chains in general.  I get that the hard part is deciding how to authorize the UTXO when the coins are returned to the main chain.  
I see how a centralized side-chain can handle this if they do a good job of controlling their private key and are trustworthy.  In fact, that could just as easily describe a wallet, they wouldn't need an actual blockchain to do that.  
My take on Drivechain is that it is essentially a game-theory solution to this problem: Allow anyone to spend these outputs and set up the incentives for miners to be the safeguards, then show why they won't steal the coins, because if the side-chain is worthwhile, it's in the miners' interests to follow and enforce the rules.
Are there any other proposed methods for decentralized side-chains?

For a few years my HODL stash was "safely" on a piece of paper.  It wasn't about to get hacked, but it wasn't backed up.  Then I got married, moved furniture around, and realized that the desk the paper was wallet was supposed to be in wasn't there anymore.
I spent an evening going through nearly every pile of old paper I had looking for it.  I had just about given up when I saw it ... in the garbage bag I was about to throw out.
I got lucky.  Keep backups of your private keys.
