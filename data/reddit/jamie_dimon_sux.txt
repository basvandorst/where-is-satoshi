No chance in hell.

I know.  Too many beers and I've been reading these same posts since 2013.  Tired of them.  :(
Edit:  I did answer the OP's question though.  I said "No."

Keep downvoting.  You fuckers have no chance against some of the brightest people on the planet who are responsible for bitcoin as it is today.
You will not ever take over bitcoin/Bitcoin.
That's the fucking point.

Whomever downvotes, please give a reason- unless you are from JP Morgan...  You are human shit.
I've been downvoted for a bunch of different issues over the past few years over different accounts.
The "crazy shit" I suggested has always been proven.
Edit:  So, you geniuses know more than I do?  Great.  
JP Morgan is largely behind everything that is happening.

Satoshi told Garzik no when he was attempting to play cowboy back in 2010.
Now here we are in 2017 and most of the brightest coders are telling him the same thing about his current bullshit...

Hi guy who hasn't been here since before 2013.  Your ignorance means nothing to me.

True but irrelevant.  Um, OK..?

Mark Zuckerberg is one of the wealthiest people on the planet.  He "got in early."  Now you and a good chunk of the planet make him richer everyday.
is correct.  You are a moron.  Attempting to apply traditional thinking to bitcoin does not work.

Fuck Garzik.
This has gotten way out of hand.
IMHO, listen to Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Dashjr (among others).
TPTB will never take control of bitcoin/Bitcoin.
Not certain what part of that they aren't grasping.

Do you sell Lambos?  If so, yes.
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:34:56
No.  Why do you people with zero net worth always post these ridiculous questions?
You will not be a millionaire tomorrow or ten years from now with your 2 (or less) bitcoin.
Just treat it as a saving account where you actually get variable interest.

If the shit in the screen grab is true, Coinbase has decided to pit their business model against some of the brightest people around the world who want the exact opposite.  This is not going to end well for Coinbase.

You completely missed the point, genius.
