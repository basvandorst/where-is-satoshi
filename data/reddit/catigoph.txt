Sadly I did not see this post until today. Thank you for sharing your experience on Cheaporn, our team and me are grateful.
I still have to clear things up, I can't reply to every single comment due to Reddit's delays and lack of time but here are some things you should know.
**Each account does not get sold/shared multiple times.**
This isn't possible due to two reasons, however we just do it to ensure the maximum quality to our customers and don't disturb the original owner in any way. The two reasons are:
1. Accounts can easily get banned if you login from multiple locations or devices. If you share the accounts between two users this does not happen.
2. If a single account would be delivered to too much people it wouldn't last for long in any case, even if the porn website had no protection. At times there is someone that changes the password and tries to get an account for free, maybe for a replacement. When this happens the owner changes the password back in less than 24 hours, nothing would change for him but something would for the "smart" user.
**Paid porn is a real thing.**
Most of Reddit's users keep joking on this but there is free porn and premium porn. The geeks could use resources such as Torrents *which I confirm are really useful* but you can't find everything there, you may need to wait a lot in order to see recent updates. Users paying for porn are the mainly the ones looking for the best video quality, there are many 4k porn websites and some VR ones.
**Are our accounts really "stolen", "hacked" or whatever?**
If you want to put in these words, yes. Our accounts are taken without owners' permission, in fact they never know their account is being shared and that's just because nobody is hurting them. However sometimes accounts are not shared, we create them ad-hoc with legit yet illegal (ex. taking advantages of errors in porn websites) ways. We do not have anything to hide.
**They're just using the same account with you, with the same benefits for each one (so 2 users for each account, I'm tired of writing this)**.
*Side question, nobody asked this yet.*
**But aren't the users' personal informations unsafe?**
Nope. If you buy accounts from Cheaporn you won't see the owner's credit card or street address, you can just use that damn porn website so it's all safe.


**Will I have to use a VPN or a proxy when I use an account?**
**Short answer:** No, you don't. 
For a better experience you should use an USA IP address, you can easily get it for free with browser's extensions, free VPNs and more. FBI isn't going to knock at your door because you bought a fucking $5 porn account and paid with bitcoin, wake up people.

I assure you that both are going great, one of them because of ads and the other because of paid subscriptions, it doesn't matter which is which as both are alive.

REALLY? WHERE?
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:01:03
Did you know that it can also be not? There is free porn and paid porn, they are two different things.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:33:26
Well at least that's a funny comment.
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:15:20
I can confirm he probably has got a free account. :)
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:16:51
It is indeed against TOS, calling this theft is way too exaggerated. The owner of each account won't ever lose his account/subscription, all his most important personal informations (such as credit cards) are still hidden.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:14:24
I don't know why you're so skeptical but there are two reasons.
1. The account can **easily** get banned/suspended when logging in from many different IPs/devices.
2. It would always end up with an user that changes the password and fucks everything up, in that case our accounts wouldn't last for months.
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:37:07
Indeed but you can't get this kind of porn for free. ;)
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:26:19
Considering that we get several orders everyday then yes, there is someone. :)

~~Calm your tits.~~
We are adding new products every week, yesterday we added "porn packages", you can find from 9 to 15 websites on the same account depending on the one you buy. :)

There are a lot of websites owned by a very few networks, our little business won't hurt them. Each account only gets sold one time thus it is only shared between 2 users.
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:24:18
I know their website but we have way different methods. They keep all their accounts in the same place till they get replaced with new ones and in the meanwhile let a (probably) undefined amount of users get them.
Our accounts are unique, each one gets deleted from the system once it's sold, nobody (even between different customers) can get the same account 2 times. Even if we refund a customer his account won't ever be added in the website anymore.

He really doesn't get it. We are not talking about cars, I wish we would only need a few clicks to get our "car" back and also share our "car" with thiefs and go in different places at the same time.

I'm sorry, I'm not going to post in this subreddit for a week or so. I just know that there is people interested in my project over here but I understand that watching this post almost everyday could be annoying.
@_date: 2016-08-01 18:09:56
Mainly Full HD/4k, you can also find hentai and VR porn.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:25:12
We have different accounts, prices are different and selling "hacked" accounts means sharing each account between two users while both get the benefits.
@_date: 2016-09-04 11:54:07
Because you can't find all the paid porn for free, our prices are way lower compared to anyone else and I think they're fair.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:06:04
Apparently yes. :)
