Excellent idea!

I stopped accepting Moneybooker because when a transaction completes it doesn't list as much information about the purchaser, which is part of what I use for my verification process.

Hi GreenHairyMartian
Depending on the amount you are wanting to transfer our fees can actually be lower than BitInstant. BitInstant applies  $1 charge that you do not see  immediately. Our service does not.

We're not currently offering a service selling prepaid debit cards for bitcoins.  Our FAQ addresses the only circumstances in which we deal with them.

It's the Themia Lite theme for wordpress. If you look there are probably a few thousand sites using it. 
And I'm using a .tk domain because it works as well as any other domain and it's free :-)

Give me a sec, I'm putting the banner on our site now.
@_date: 2012-04-29 23:57:06
Thanks for the tip. I've been doing that since this occurred which is how I figured out what was happening.

Hi Fimp, 
As per our discussion previously the website designer we used definitely stole your design. We've acknowledged this, apologized profusely, canned him, and are in the process of a complete site redesign. Unfortunately these things take time. You commented before that you understood the situation. Anything beyond that seems as though you are attempting to trash a competitor. I know the bitcoin ecosystem is very competitive, but resorting to trash talk seems somewhat low-brow. 
I apologize about the wording, but we ARE the only provider taking PayPal on the planet, and the only one accepting credit cards outside of Scandinavia. I've updated the text to reflect this. If any of the small fraction of a percentage of user's here are in Scandinavia please feel free to use Fimp's service, as you are in his market.

Hi wisard, 
We've considered this possibility and have compensated for it in the amount we are proposing. This loan is not only for the overhaul, but for additional liquidity as well. This combined with the fact that we have left a large and very comfortable buffer means there should be very little risk of a catastrophic over budget.
@_date: 2012-05-13 00:56:23
We were made aware of the rip-off shortly (a matter of hours) before you mentioned it and immediately put the site redesign in progress. We wanted to get the site redesign in progress before you were contacted. You posted about it before we had a chance. 
The mention of us being in different markets was in reference to the time the site would remain up until the redesign was completed. edit: This is how it was explained to me.
Fimp, I understand you are angry that someone ripped off your design. I would be too. Please understand that we're working as fast as we can to get this taken care of.
Edit in response to quote: That would be from our ex-designer / online presence. It looks like he was trying to cover his blatant plagiarism. Like I said, we (the owners) take full responsibility for this and, again, are working to correct the issue. There were a total of 3 people who spoke for the company. Me, my wife, and the person who previously worked for us. The "we" and "our" previously referred to 3 people. Now it refers to two.

We are currently accepting affiliates and affiliate products.  You would be welcome to retain your brand, or we could rebrand it under the BitPantry name.  Feel free to email us at support to work out the details.

Hello there
We appreciate you giving us a try. We are definitely small in relation to Bitinstant. With them being down our volume increased suddenly and dramatically which resulted in us being slower than normal to fill orders.
We're very sorry about the delay and are working on orders as fast as we can. We appreciate your patience.
@_date: 2012-05-12 03:02:26
Given the amount of hacking and fraud in the Bitcoin community I can definitely understand why someone would feel like this. I hope that our transparency, customer service, and consistency will speak for themselves in the long run. 
@_date: 2012-08-01 23:18:23
That's absolutely something we can add to the site.  In fact, doing so now.  Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2012-05-13 01:19:36
How about I show you the text of the contract signed with my PGP key after I blank out his name? It mentions the online presence and transparancy specifically. 
Edit: Typo
@_date: 2012-07-07 02:13:24
We've corrected this. Thanks.
@_date: 2012-07-07 02:11:37
July 9th. We've clarified this text.
Thanks for pointing that out.
@_date: 2012-07-08 00:12:56
It's easy. Go to  , select one of the Cash Deposit options, and follow the instructions. We'll send you the BTC to you or to your Mt. Gox. Just put it in the notes where you want it to go.
@_date: 2012-05-13 01:44:33
Sent. I didn't send the text as I only have the contract in PDF format now which isn't editable. I took a screenshot of the scanned contract open in PDF format and used an image editor to blank out the confidential information. I hope this satisfies you and you understand that this wasn't intentional and that we're not lying. 
It was probably a stupid mistake to give someone, no matter how trusted, the authority to post as us as they wish. Please be assured that this person no longer has access to any of our online assets, profiles, servers, datastores, or any other company assets at all.
Even though it wasn't me specifically it was still a member of our organization, so in the end it is still my fault. Once again I apologize. 
This is NOT the way we want to do business or the way we want to enter the bitcoin community. Our core methadologies and principals are not reflected by these actions.

If you become a verified buyer for us that rate drops to a total 8.4% for credit cards, and the same great rates on other transaction types. Plus, we won't limit your transaction size.
@_date: 2012-08-01 22:17:02
Sorry, the pics are not the greatest, but we're not really photographers.  It smells awesome, like smoky bacon and sweet sugar, and spices ;-)

I've tested both the buying and selling forms several times and I can't seem to replicate this error. If it happens again once the site is back up please let me know. Be sure to include the URL that is in the address bar when it happens.
@_date: 2012-05-01 04:42:34
Hey Jaelz, I'll take care of it for you since you're already a verified buyer. Just place an order for what you need and mention this post in the notes, and pay using the PP addy you already used.
@_date: 2012-05-11 23:57:01
It's not that you shouldn't buy bitcoins using PayPal, it's that you shouldn't SELL bitcoins using PayPal because of the risk of chargebacks. 
Lucky for you we do provide a service that is willing to take the risk. We're accepting PayPal and credit cards in exchange for delivering bitcoins to you.
Check it out: 
@_date: 2012-07-07 03:29:56
We do sincerely apologize. but the reason no one else offers credit card for bitcoins is due to the huge risk associated with it (via fraud/chargebacks/etc).  This is why we have very rigid security and verification measures in place, and the only time we do not accept orders is when those criteria cannot be met.  
@_date: 2012-04-29 14:41:01
I found out what was causing the issue. It looks like this happened in some browsers that did not properly read the redirect code that the form used. This has been fixed.
Thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2012-04-29 01:51:33
I take multiple steps to insure the payment is valid, not fraud, and record multiple pieces of evidence that can be used in a chargeback case should one occur. I would be able to prove from beginning to end that a real customer placed this order, wanted the order, and that the bitcoins were sent by me to the address they specified. I've also noted in the TOS/COU that once bitcoins are sent the sale is final and that they agree to not hold me responsible should they screw up and something happen to their bitcoins. 
 I don't really want to go into any more detail on my fraud prevention and detection in case any scammers might be reading this post. 
I also have an extremely stiff charge back policy in the Terms of Service. Give it a look.
@_date: 2012-05-11 23:35:15
We've updated that text. It currently depends on the size of the order and the payment method. We take slightly longer for Dwolla and PayPal orders, as we like to give a bit of breathing room in case of fraud.
@_date: 2012-05-12 02:59:18
Thank you very much for your feedback. 
Our customer service is one thing pride ourselves on as compared to other services. 
@_date: 2012-05-13 01:15:11
I'm thinking there is a miscommunication or possibly lies here between parties (and ex-parties) on my side. Again, there were multiple people in charge of responding to online comments, email, etc. That's why replies on reddit were answered within minutes, that's why emails are always answered within minutes. Generally I (Ryan) was in charge of the financial aspects of the business and our presence in bitcoin-otc, my wife was responsible for customer relations, and our ex-designer was in charge of the site and our online presense. He was intended to be completely transparent. 
I wasn't the one that responded to that reddit post. I wasn't even aware of the blatant ripoff until someone told me directly in bitcoin-otc and at first I had thought you ripped US off until I confronted our designer.
This seems to be a giant mess since he was given permission to post as me. I get why this seems like a giant sack of cow manure to you, and I honestly don't expect you to believe otherwise. But regardless of what happened before, we're cleaning it up, and I apologize.
@_date: 2012-04-29 23:42:20
Because I'm ADHD and left it out. Adding now.
@_date: 2012-05-12 14:52:49
First, we don't allow any PayPal or credit card transactions over $100 without becoming a verified Buyer. Second, we capture every IP address and compare it against a known public proxy, VPN, and tor exit router list. Third, we match the email address they use on the order form to the PayPal email address used to pay for the bitcoins. Fourth, we match the geolocation of the IP address to the area code of the phone number and the billing or shipping address on the PayPal account. We also call, by hand, every customer who orders using PayPal or a credit card. For verified buyers (who we charge a much lower rate) we also have them sign and send in a document which states they will not charge back.
@_date: 2012-04-29 02:30:11
What exactly are you doing to get the 404 error?
@_date: 2012-05-12 03:20:56
We're sorry about the PayPal charge, but unfortunately it's a necessary evil. We've acknowledged this on our FAQ page. If you would like to give it a look you can find the page here:
We don't list cash transaction locations on the site as there are thousands of them. You can deposit into any Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, or CitiBank. Because we like to provide an excellent customer service experience we handle each cash transaction individually. Once you place an order with the Cash Deposit method selected we will send you an email with further instructions.
