All systems rely on some level of competence somewhere. Bitcoin requires each individual's competence to protect access to their own private keys. The traditional banking system has a security footprint vastly larger than that, and it leaks money as a consequence (separate to the argument of leaking value through increasing money supply, i.e. dilution).

Bitcoin was created as a response to problems with the existing money and banking systems. This story is one instance of massive incompetence in that existing system, i.e. it reinforces the original argument for bitcoin's creation.
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:47:06


The distinction I'm making (and where we're disagreeing) is that I'm claiming that the bitcoin distributed ledger is exceedingly difficult to hack, AFAIK no-one has succeeded in compromising it to-date. The theft of bitcoins from exchanges and other means is due to incompetence and mismanagement of off blockchain ledgers.
As an individual I can choose to educate myself, make a cryptographically secure random private key, and I can have high confidence (A) that my bitcoin will not be stolen, and (B) I will not have to pay for thefts elsewhere.
In contrast to that, the prevailing banking system has numerous issues baked into its fundamental design, so there's nothing I can do to avoid having to pay for thefts when they occur, i.e. as a taxpayer that ultimately has to make up for the losses due to theft. 


Please explain how miners are a security risk, given that they do not have access to any of the private keys necessary to steal bitcoin.


I can still choose to transact on the blockchain directly and therefore avoid any entity I think may be untrustworthy or insecure. I can't do this with traditional banking.

Central banks hold reserves of foreign currency. You're right that they don't hold that currency as cash, it's an entry in a ledger in other central banks, e.g. in this case Bangladesh has several billion dollars of reserves most of which are probaly in US dollars, these dollars are in the form of an entry in a ledger at the US federal reserve bank (essentially a bank account). The thieves gained access to the SWIFT system to allow them to transfer from the US bank account to their own accounts. Which is all a bit silly because the transfers are recorded and therefore destination accounts are now known to the various relevant police authorities.
@_date: 2016-04-06 23:29:12
From the link:


I really don't understand the concept of a blockchain with no PoW. The PoW is central to how bitcoin works, without that you need some form of trust, which leads back to square one, i.e. private ledgers with authorised and synchronised access. I worry that I'm missing something fundamental
@_date: 2016-04-24 23:12:15
There's also the Lightning Network to consider, which in principle should allow scaling of off-chain transactions, but with much of the trustlessness of the bitcoin ledger. So it's not like we have to revert to trusting private ledgers (i.e. traditional banks) to scale out.

Indeed, it merely moves to another bank account, possibly even at the same bank. However money is destroyed when paying off a loan, since the creation of a loan created the money, so it's just reversal of that mechanism. Now, if lots of people take out loans to buy bitcoin, or hold off paying down loans to buy bitcoin, then they're collectively increasing the fiat money supply and this would likely boost the economy while this situation persists.

If the pound buys you 0.5% as much silver as 317 years ago, then we can take the reciprocal to state this in terms of silver, i.e. 1 / 0.005 = 200.
So if you bough £1 worth of silver 317 years ago, that same amount of silver is worth £200 today. In percentage terms that is 20,000% overall growth. Now we just take the geometric mean to get the annual growth rate that would give an overall increase of 20,000% over 317 years.
Geometric mean in this case is the 317th root of 200, which is approximately 1.01685, i.e. an increase of x1.01685 a year, or 1.685% in percentage terms.
You can check the value by applying the annual growth rate 317 times...
overall growth = 1.01685^317 = 199.72  (not exactly 200 because I rounded the annual rate)

Bear in mind that those exponential growth curves are possibly, even likely, to turn out to be sigmoids, i.e. a growth 'spurt' followed by a long period of mediocre and slowing growth. I don't think it's clever to assume such exponential growth will continue - it *might* work out, or it might not. Modest steps forward in line with what's very likely achievable in 5 years is where my vote is.

The growth in communication bandwidth in particular has been due to developments in fibre optics, e.g. improved materials, lasers, physical encodings (light phase, multiple-wavelengths), etc. It's hard to imagine a whole swathe of equally beneficial improvements, we've took the low hanging fruit and now we're (possibly) in a slow growth phase, until perhaps we have something that is even better than fibre optics... but that's wishful thinking at this time IMO.
Computing performance wise, I agree that we're nowhere near theoretical computing limits of matter (e.g. of the limits of a square cm of matter) or computing efficiency, but again, it's down to how much of what has been achieved was low hanging fruit. If we plan for modest gains then we can open up the limits if it turned out that we underestimated.

Based on the current network hashrate of about 788,973,550 GH/s, that's equivalent to 98,622 of these SP40s, which in turn would consume 216 megawatts.
At 10 cents / kWh, that would cost $21,600 per hour, or $3600 per 10 mins (i.e. per block). A block's worth of BTC is currently worth $417*25 = $10,425.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:34:06


OK - I didn't mention latency :)


For backbones sure. For everyone else there's a cost involved if you go beyond what there is wider demand for. E.g. in the 90s the company I worked for paid towards having the road into town dug up and new fibre laid - in order to get the bandwidth we needed. You can do that again now as a BTC miner, or just use the bandwidth being installed for the general market place (i.e. enough to watch HD video on demand).
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:53:00
This is the most positive thing I've read about bitcoin in a long time. There are some very impressive developments in the works so I'm quite surprised to see the mostly negative comments posted so far.
The efficiency gains, moving block data early to greatly reduce latency - it takes a strong knowledge base to devise these solutions and have the confidence to code them well. As a long time developer and bitcoin fan this fills me with confidence that the devs are doing the right things and not just reactionary increases to block size that would probably cause more problems than they would solve, in the long term especially.
@_date: 2015-06-22 11:36:07
You said:


My point is that the fact that there was no explicit BTC/cash exchange is a technicality. The miner **did** spend money to acquire those BTC, and then chose not to sell them on. That **is** demand for BTC, being 'fuelled' by spending of cash. So e.g. if the the miner sold enough BTC to exactly cover their costs (electricity + equipment + payroll, etc.) **then** they would be a neutral actor, and the 25 new BTC every 10 mins is supply that needs to be bought by someone else, otherwise the price will fall to find a buyer.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:53:10
Right now the CBOE futures price is $17,900, and the bitcoin market price is $16,365. I find this strange, why not just buy bitcoin directly?
@_date: 2015-06-22 07:56:41


But do you see that the miner is effectively a buyer in that situation - they have chosen not to sell, and therefore not to add supply the supply/demand balance that would change the price. It's the same outcome as if they always sold, and I sat patiently buying 25BTC every 10 mins (or the market as a whole did). The point is that if miners sold all of their mined BTC then there would either have to be buyers for all of them *or* the price would have to correct to find new buyers. A stable price indicates a balance between supply and demand, and much of that demand is actually coming from the miners themselves, by not selling.

It's a bit like politics in that what is correct is somewhat open to debate, hence the problem. But my short answer to you point is that the options presented should have already gone through a vetting process by core devs, etc. before being presented as an option for the community to vote on.

@_date: 2014-03-16 08:45:31
I understand your point, but you've conflated fiat money with fractional reserve banking (FRB). FRB does **not** allow a bank to lend more money than it has, but it **does** allow it to lend out *most* of the money - such that if every depositor wanted their money back today the bank would not have it (a 'bank run').
FRB therefore expands the money supply because now the lent out money can be **redeposited** in another bank, and that bank can re-lend out the money **again**. If you follow through the maths then for a bank reserve requirement of proportion P (0 to 1) an initial $100 issued by the central bank can expand to up to 1/P * 100.
Fiat money is where the central bank issues paper money, but the absolute key point here is that fractional reserve banking can work with physical money (e.g. gold), the two systems are pretty much orthogonal, at least in the purest definitions of FRB and fiat money.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:19:39
Also, cover what fractional reserve banking is and why it can result in bank runs, why the gold standard wasn't really notes backed by gold once the money supply was expanded beyond the amount of gold. And that fiat money is distinct from fractional reserve banking (you can have either, both or neither - e.g. just hard money such as gold or bartering).
Describe how much the US dollar has devalued over the last 100 years, say, versus a gram of gold over several centuries.

I have in mind fiat money that can be manipulated in various ways to further political agendas. Bitcoin may not be entirely safe from manipulation, but key aspects of it cannot. E.g. you can lend bitcoin and produce the equivalent of M1 money which can be inflated, but the end users get to choose to use and hold M0 money, i.e. actual bitcoins or not, or some mix of the two types.
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:41:23

Agreed. Furthermore, any algorithm lacking ASIC miners falls back to general purpose miners (GPUs and FPGAs), so there's an argument that you get one dominant cryptocurrency per hardware supported algo (SHA256, Scrypt...), and one other supported by the GPU/FPGA mining crowd. However, any moderately successful new alt-coin with no specialist h/w will simple acquire it over time so long as it' value stays high enough for long enough.

But the general public mostly just gets to use cash or a bank account (and loans and mortgages). The dollars in these cases are considered equivalent by the vast majority of people, despite the fact that the bank dollar has not insignificant risks associated with it.

Free market money and competing currencies - to date governments have tended to suppress alternative forms of money.

Ok I see where we're disagreeing then but not sure I agree still. If I deposit either gold coins or fiat into a bank account then I need to withdraw them to spend them - i.e. transfer them to another person and their bank account.
So for instance, prior to 1700 or so the UK had a gold and silver coin based monetary system (no bank notes). However you could get a loan from a bank and you would then have two accounts, one with a positive balance that you could withdraw coins from, and the loan account with a negative balance that you could only deposit into (repayments). If you wanted to do something with the loaned money you had to withdraw the coins - or get the bank to xfer the money direct to another account.
In effect there was a fractional reserve system but there was no fiat money at that time in the UK. In fact the first bank notes had a one to one mapping to physical gold, so that wasn't fiat either. It was much later that the 1-2-1 link was broken at which point the gold standard became a nonsense that was always going to fail eventually.
Bitcoin is like M0 (narrow) money and any token that represent a bitcoin would be broad money (M4 or whatever it called these days). The key distinction for me with say Pounds or Dollars is that I can choose to own bitcoin M0 or M4, but with Dollars I don't have that choice - well, unless I stash bank notes in a safe somewhere, but the bank might just change the note design and void the old notes.

Any idea what the power usage is measured at the wall socket? (you can buy a power socket adapter with a display on it). For reference I have a Raspberry Pi B Rev 2 (512MB RAM, Ethernet) + 128GB SSD + Powered hub. The hub and the Pi are powered by a single 5V 2.5A adapter, but this turned out to be overkill as I've yet to see it draw more than a steady 3W at the wall.
The SSD draws about 1W idle, and there's maybe some loss in the adapter. With just the Pi by itself on the standard power adapter that came with it, it draws just 1W idle, 2W busy.

The hardware efficiency is not a factor in energy usage, as bizarely as that may seem, due to the self adjusting difficulty. Essentially it comes down to how many BTC you can earn per unit of energy, and the cost of the energy.
Or if the price is driven up significantly by demand then the energy cost becomes secondary to the cost of buying new hardware, ultimately that comes down to the cost of borrowing money versus the return on the mining hardware.

Fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend only money that has been deposited with them, but they must keep some fraction as reserve. Now the debtor can deposit in another bank and that bank can again lend the money out, however, this is possible with physical money such as gold, the mechanism is not specific to fiat money.
tl;dr I think you've conflated fiat money with fractional reserve banking.

Apologies, but I don't follow how any of that relates to my point. I can choose to hold bitcoin or a bitcoin IOU. The IOU market will expand and contract over time, and the value of IOUs vary accordingly. The value of the underlying bitcoin will vary also, but will have a different price because it has a different set of risks associated with it, the main point being that the money supply is hard deterministic, where the IOU money supply is not.

I didn't quite get the point at the end about mining being strong and China being an export country. If the government dislike bitcoin then why would they allow mining to flourish?
Maybe this relates to the centralisation of power, that is, if there are miners then there are miners they can control to exert influence over bitcoin if and when necessary. This could lead to China's miners 'dumping' BTC onto exchanges to suppress the price.

I think there's enough unknowns for the current $500 price to be about right. Unknowns about network stability over time (e.g. will anything unexpected happen similar to the blockchain fork of 2013, or unintended consequences such as the continued mining centralisation), government intervention, financial regulation, that kind of thing, as well as the fundamental question of will it catch on and scale well. Right now it's a case of 'so far so good', and with each passing day of a stable network and price the chances of success improve. I actually think we'll be in this phase for maybe 3 years or more before things really start to ignite and your $100k starts to look achievable. Baby steps.

Oh ok.

I disagree. I use a traditional bank account because it conveniently gives me access to a VISA debit card (here in the UK anything over a small sum of money is transacted this way), a cheque book (still useful in some scenarios) ability to send electronic payments to other accounts (which in the UK is near-instant in many cases), etc. Yes I can get a loan paid into that account, but I would move the money elsewhere if it were more beneficial to do so.


I'm not aware of any such option in the UK domestic/retail banking sector, though I'd be happy to be proved wrong.

Thanks for these links. So if I extend the chart to show all history it looks like BTC has been heavily shorted since these contracts became available (around April 2013). Am I reading that right?
Then again, if you want to go long then you just buy BTC, and if you want leverage then many will take out a loan... hence the ratio of longs to shorts is probably less interesting than the total amount of shorts at any given time.

In addition to Metcalf's law, I like to think of the utility of bitcoin also being related to it's age, i.e. how long it has been running for without failing.

Seems like the two metrics are inter-dependent, in that an older network is perceived as stable and trustworthy, and the number of users (and other metrics such as the tx rate) is partly (or largely?) based on how confident people are in it. 
Put it this way - would you feel confident putting say 50% of your net worth into a cryptocurrency that was 100 years old and had a history of essentially flawless operation (except for a few hickups), or a 5 year old currency were the user base (e.g. r/bitcoin) are constantly raising questions about what miners will do in a few years, will they consolidate into one big powerful entity, etc. (and numerous other questions).
I'm a big fan of BTC and I have about 1% of my net worth in BTC (depending how you calc it), it would be more if I were more confident around these issues, and hence I would buy more and push up the price. If we're still here in another ten years my confidence would be much higher. That said, if the network had not grown then there might be constant rumours about BTC fizzling out and becoming an irrelevance. So yeh, interdependent metrics.
Need to ponder on this some more.
What I do feel is that the price and tx histroy to-date are extremely misleading to anyone trying to extrapolate.

Not sure I agree with that. Any transactor can look at the recent history of transaction volume and fees and determine what tx speed is gained for a given fee (typically). So the transactor wanting to achieve high speed needs to set a fee about or higher than the recent highest, that's just supply ad demand.  Supply here is space on each block which is is fixed, so as demand exceeeds supply the tx fees increase to reduce demand. If demand is inelastic then fees get stupidy expensive.

It's a scenario worth considering. However, I think you're overlooking that bitcoin is a novel asset class; as such so long as it doesn't fail in some horrible, fundamental way, then I don't see it falling significantly long term. However, I do think a long boring plateau is plausible. My low projection puts such a plateau at somewhere around $5000 ($100B 'market cap' or total money supply). Noting that rising from $1000 to $5000 in ten years would represent an average return rate of about 17% per year.

Ok cool thanks, I get it. 
tl;dr It's showing which side of the order book is most active. Bids (offers to buy) or offers (offers to sell). e.g. If, on balance, bid orders are invoked that indicates people are on the whole desperate to sell. The chart captures the history of this balance over time.

So there was elevated demand earlier in the year, and now there is less demand. 
Also bear in mind that one of the miners (don't recall which) has openly stated that they keep a significant portion of the BTC they mine, hence essentially creating demand (or restricting supply I suppose). If they (and miners like them) at some point decided to release a greater proportion of coins, e.g. due to cashflow concerns, then that would significantly effect the balance of supply and demand.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:58:26
Right, so when the last block with a reward of 50 BTC was mined at the end of 2012 the market price was about $14, thus the money supply was about $100,800 per day, versus about $1M today.

Interesting how the number of inputs/outputs has risen beyond what you can see in the pure transaction rate plot.

There are 3600 new BTC mined every day, @ $300 that's $1.08M USD per day, $32.8M / month, $394M / year. That's a lot of money for the market to soak up on a continual basis. Without fresh demand or some news to fuel additional speculative demand it wouldn't surprise me greatly if we saw $100 in 2015. But it also wouldn't surprise me if, say, something like the Winkelvoss ETF took off in 2015 and caused the price to rise substantially. Basically it's a high variance asset, and on that basis I'm trickle buying (once a month on average) for the time being.

The original definition of inflation referred to the money supply, i.e increasing or inflating supply which has the side effect of causing prices to rise (inflate). By that definition bitcoin is inflationary for now (10% per annum in fact), but long term is fixed. Using deflationary to mean falling prices came later and is sort of wrong IMO.

I think you're oversimplifying. If miners act in a way that deviates too far from the wishes of the bitcoin community as a whole then the value of bitcoins are diminished, hence any mining reward is diminished. Yes they can cause damage, and cause enough distrust to cause an alt-coin and/or side chain to form to try and address the problems. 
tl;dr miners have an incentive to keep bitcoin as a whole as a working form of money that people choose to use over and above other forms of money. Any short term gains run counter to those longer term incentives.

For me one of bitcoin's strengths is that it has a very different set of strengths and weaknesses compared to any existing asset class, and will therefore increasingly be of interest to anyone managing a portfolio with a balanced risk profile. It's not necessarily that bitcoin is better than any other asset class (although there are aspects where it is better), but that it's different to all existing classes.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:40:15
Also, it's viable to create an alt-coin that takes the most up to date bitcoin blockchain as a starting point. Thus everyone with a BTC balance has a balance in the new alt-coin.

Apple had revenue of $182 Billion in 2014.
Microsoft $86 Billion.
Let's estimate the utility of all the bitcoin transactions combined in 2014. A very generous 100k transaction/day * 365.25 days = 36 million transactions. If in total they generated $86B of value then each transaction would have delivered value (to the transactors) of $2,354.

Venezuela is a perhaps an example of this right now. The legal currency has limited practicality and probably only persists because of its legal status. Usually the US dollar becomes the de facto currency in states where the legal currency is impractical to use.


So the governments would be doing this - they get voting power at a cost, so there's no reason why big corporations couldn't do the same, but I figure they just defer that effort to the governments (which they strongly influence in some cases). That could come under the general pattern of shifting costs away from corporations to the taxpayer.
Another aspect is variations in the cost of energy. So if you're a solar farm in some relatively stable region of Africa, after you've installed the system the running costs are near zero, so you can mine regardless of the difficulty level. But there is still a running cost, and an overall profit level where you just give up.
This is part of another hypothesis I have about big solar farms popping up in places away from population centres, i.e. where there wouldn't normally be a market for the energy produced. You now have a market for the energy without having to install expensive power transmission lines (e.g from the Sahara to Europe!), and the associated security risks.

To my eyes the market cap seems to be following a very obvious sub-exponential projection, the precise nature of which is unclear but my low/high best fit lines give low/high valuations of $1800(*) and $5500 respectively for January 2020. I can't see it hitting $1T market cap until mid 2022 at the very earliest, based on a very optimistic high projection that I don't see much evidence for right now. My own high projection puts $1T market cap at about 10 years from now.

It's a standard for encrypting private keys with a password/passphrase. So anyone finding the BIP38 key won't have access to the BTC unless they also know the password.

Then why do they have reserve requirements? Fractional reserve is the mechanism by which private banks create money out of 'thin air'.
@_date: 2016-01-06 11:26:16
OK mechanism was not the best word to use there. Fractional reserve is the system under which reserves are lent out as loans, thus allowing the reserve money to be 'double counted'. Fractional reserve is the system and lending is a specific mechanism within that system. 
However, my initial point stands. Private banks lend from their reserves and that creates new M1 money. They don't create new money from nothing, only central banks do that.
Side note regarding the hard limit: If all banks lend to their reserve limits then the an initial M0 amount of $1 becomes 1/r of M1 money (where r is the reserve proportion, i.e. 0.1 indicating 10%). So a 10% requirement allows M1 to be 10x the size of M0, and a 1% reserve allows 100x.

Either you or I are confusing fiat money (created by a central bank) and money created through fractional reserve. Those two mechanisms are distinct and independent, i.e. in principle an economy can run on either, both, or neither.
I mostly agree with your point though. If the banks can't lend savings then they're just a vault with some security guards and admin staff. To make loans they would always have to ask the central bank for a loan that they then loan on at a slightly higher interest rate, which I assume is what the plan is here if the vote goes through.

Please do not use this method, it is highly unsafe. For example, an attacker trying to find good candidates for private keys can take an electronic corpus of books and apply various automated schemes for extracting words, such as the scheme you provide.
(to original poster) In the context of cryptographic security, entropy is a measure of how unlikely a given key/sequence is to occur in the world as a whole, thus any key material taken from existing sources such as web sites or books is very low entropy, unless you add in further randomness - such as selecting words randomly rather than first word of each page.
Cryptographic entropy is not an inherent property of a given sequence. E.g. in the extreme case I can generate a pure random key (say by rolling dice), and that is high entropy, but if I now publish it on my facebook page, then it's chances of occurring in the world have massively increased and it is now low entropy. This is all rather context sensitive of course, but hopefully you get the idea.

At face value I did say that, yes. Reading between the lines, the broader point is regarding where we are with respect to the capacity limit - i.e. there's a possible scenario where demand greatly outstrips supply in the very near term, even though projecting the the tx rate trend suggests a lower rate is sufficient for normal functioning in the near term.
I was trying to plant the seed of discussion around that particular point. Networks don't always exhibit smooth changes in traffic rate, they can have bursts in demand, e.g. the power grid at sunrise, or the phone network during a natural disaster.

Bitcoin was in part a response to the problems caused by financial contracts, which are in essence a form of money and therefore are part of the expansion of the money supply. Bitcoin was created as a response to out of control money supply.
In short - yes you may be right as a strategy that works for you, but I personally am concerned about the opaque risks inherent to financial derivatives; ultimately - will this contract be honoured in the midsts of a financial crash, and will its existence increase the chances of a crash? 
Admittedly I'm heavily influenced by Nassim Taleb, but I do think he makes good points.

The output of a cryptographic hash is indistinguishable from pure randomness when taken alone, but it's entropy in the world as whole is not really any higher than the original seed data. 
As a voted down comment below states, people can and do construct vast rainbow tables by taking data from the internet and generating bitcoin private keys from it in various ways. All of those keys look like pure randomness from the point of view of statistical tests, but they have very low entropy.

That quoted paragraph doesn't hold water, i.e. if a fixed number of people use bitcoin as a store of value (so switchign between buying and selling as they go through various life phases) then there are net holvers &gt;0 and the value is &gt; 0. There is no need (A) for a continuing price rise and thus (B) a continuous supply of new converts.

You can see the fees on each live transaction at [tradeblock](
Looks like 0.0002 BTC is a common fee, which is about $0.20 at the current exchange rate.
Note that fees are proportional to size of transaction in bytes, not the amount you're sending. For a single person to person transaction it costs the same to send $1 as $100M.

No, the USD is unique in that respect, but it's something to bear in mind with any other currency. E.g. India's withdrawal of 500 and 1000 rupee notes basically forced a lot of people living abroad with a stash of rupees to get on a plane to India to exchange for something else. 
500 Euro notes are being phased out on a more calm schedule, but they are going. As for USD, I agree with your point with one caveat - we're one clumsy trump tweet away from your point no longer being a certainty.
In the interests of balance, it's also possible that trump could command the NSA, CIA, etc to launch a clamp down on bitcoin.

Demand for transactions is increasing despite a fixed supply of block capacity, hence the price of space in blocks goes up. So this is an indication of demand for transaction space now that the  tx rate has reached its maximum. And in fact it's a better measure of demand than tx rate before the capacity was reached, due to the endless debates about how much was real demand, and how much just spam or people moving their own BTC between different addresses, tumblers, etc.

It is however a functioning form of money, and like the privately minted monies of yore, is valued based on its reputation and usefulness in comparison to the alternatives.
Right now the alternatives are looking shaky in a few places, but in terms of the global economy as a whole they're doing OK, so there's not really a demand for BTC outside of us lot.
However, there are stresses building in the banking system, and the longer BTC continues without failing in any significant way the more it will be considered as a form of money. If it does grow significantly I think it will be over a period of many years, at least 10-15. With the caveat that if there is another big global crisis it would perhaps give BTC a boost that would accelerate adoption a little.
And that for me is bitcoin's purpose right now, to just be there, sitting patiently to be available whenever people might want to use it. People say that the events in Greece and Argentina, etc. haven't affected BTC, but I think there's a slow burn going on in the back of people's minds. People know it's there and will gradually come to wonder if bitcoin can benefit them in any way - for some of those people over the coming years the answer will be - yes.

One might be able to envisage scenarios where they would, but realistic scenarios are much harder to imagine than for centrally controlled monies.
Furthermore, having an economic majority vote greatly increases the chances that the limit increase would be beneficial to the economic majority, but once again it's even harder to imagine scenarios where they would vote for an increase and it not be in their interest.
I personally wouldn't be so bold as to claim these scenarios don't exist, but in terms of playing a probabilities game they're much lower probability scenarios than other forms of money (so far).

They can release bitcoin core with the necessary blocksize alterations, but ultimately miners and node operators have to choose to use that version. A committee could have a role in offering analysis, information and guidance, but ultimately the community decides.
When blocks truly start to fill up the fees will escalate, miners will then begin to wonder if they can increase fee income by increasing block size, or not. If they think it will increase income then they may organise to build and release their own version of bitcoin core.

You're not considering second order (knock on) effects. If you transmit the electricity into the grid, or use it locally, then you are fulfilling some electricity demand that was already there, and therefore a power generation plant elsewhere will have to reduce output to compensate. If that other plant was burning fossil fuels then there's a net reduction in CO2 emissions. If however the power grid is partly or largely supplied by renewable or nuclear power then sure, there is now excess carbon neutral power that is being displaced by gas. Well, in reality the spot price of electricity falls to zero and you need some agreements in place to coordinate how to handle that and keep things commercially viable for everyone.

I totally agree. If there's an extensive fractional reserve system on top of bitcoin, you can still choose to hold actual bitcoins, which is similar to holding cash but with lots of benefits over cash.
Fractional reserve implies the occasional bank run when people are spooked and flood to get their real bitcoins back from the limited amount held in reserve, but you can avoid that by holding your own bitcoin. So I don't think bitcoin banking system would be immune from bank runs, but you can at least choose to make yourself immune from them.


It was already illegal, although the law has been beefed up somewhat. My suspicion is that bitcoin is too small and to warrant changing laws to ban it at this stage, and by the time it's big enough that it's back on the radar of governments are parliaments, then it will be too big a contributor to economies to ban without causing an economic hit. So I don't think there will be an international law akin to copyright law, but it will be interesting to see how things pan out.

I'm in favour of a modest increase such as this, as I think we can make a much better decision about where to go long term with another 12 months or so of knowledge on how the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole is evolving. As part of that we get to see if even this modest increase has unanticipated effects that we can learn from to create a better strategy in the mid to long term.
I am a bit worried about the relatively short lead time, but given where we are it doesn't seem unreasonable.
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:13:41
That depends on each miner's profit margin, i.e. if the profit margin is very thin \[for a given miner\] then they are spending almost as much in electricity (and other costs) as they receive in rewards, therefore they must sell a large proportion of the mined BTC just to pay the bills.
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:26:55
\&gt;  But we're not talking about power that goes into the grid at any point.
I think this might be the root of the disagreement. So let me try to explain why bitcoin mining behaves similarly to electricity generation and distribution.
A new miner can come online at any time, and add extra hashing capacity. This causes the average rate that blocks are found to go up slightly, and therefore blocks are found more frequently than the desired one block every 10 minutes (on average).  At this stage all of the existing miners are still running, plus the new miner.
At the next difficulty adjustment (every 2016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks), the difficulty is increased to a level that results in block rate back to one every 10 minutes. At that point some mining that was operating at the very limit of profitability switches off, because  they are now operating at a loss. This is very likely to occur because competition between miners keeps the profit margins low.
So the new miner displaced an existing miner, and the total amount of mining remained stable. So in this scenario the new miner may have had access to cheaper electricity than the miner it displaced, and/or the new miner may be using newer hardware with runs at a higher hash rate per unit of energy put in (more hashes per joule).
An electricity distribution network operates in a very similar way, except on an instantaneous basis, i.e. we can't wait 2 weeks for the equilibrium to be reached because the network frequency would go high and outside of tolerance, causing damage to the grid and electrical equipment/appliances. E.g. in the US the power grid operates at 60Hz AC, but if there is excess power being supplied then the frequency goes up, and there needs to be some coordination to decide who reduces power input to bring it back within tolerance (near to 60Hz).
The coordination necessarily involves comparisons of energy supply prices, so e.g. you might have a coal plant operating at 5cents/kWh, and as the sun comes up (or wind speed picks or) a solar plant (or wind farm) may start to supply power offered at 2cents/kWh; the grid frequency goes up, and the coordination and negotiation that occurs will result in the coal plant reducing output, not the solar plant, because the solar plant has a \*marginal\* cost of producing energy of practically 0 cents/kWh, whereas the coal plant has to burn coal.
So in terms of the dynamics of a new producer coming online and adding power (or hash 'power'), and some other producer having to reduce supply (or electricity or hash power) as a result, the bitcoin mining 'network' is very similar to an electricity distribution grid.
Actually the growth in renewable supply and how it's being dealt with is a really interesting subject, with lots of unanswered questions about how the coordination will evolve as renewable supplies increase. E.g. the UK has built a fairly big network of wind turbines that 'dump' sometimes as much as half of the UKs power demand into the grid. Right now the wind output varies between 5 and 15GW, and national demand cycles between about 20-45 GW. So there's already occasions where there is excess power coming into the grid from wind, solar, and nuclear (which is very slow to reduce in power output), and few options for directing excess power into storage (there's a few pumped storage options, and small battery arrays, but that's about it - nothing that could absorb an excess GW, let alone multiple Gigawatts).
The bitcoin network has similar dynamics with regard to some miners being 'inelastic' in how they respond to excess, e.g. some miners are located near hydroelectric dams in China that were built with the expectation of local demand that never materialised, so those miners can just keep mining no matter what happens at near zero electricity costs. Whereas other miners use excess local coal plant capacity, which is cheap but not as cheap as hydro.
Anyways, this is tuning into an essay, but I hope that gives you some idea of how modern power distribution systems operate and how they're similar to the bitcoin mining. One of the key things is that grid frequency is the main signal used to coordinate at a near instantaneous time scale (not voltage, which varies locally for all sorts of reasons). This came about because spinning generators will slow down slightly when the power draw increases, losing some of there angular momentum, requiring increased heat and steam pressure to bring the turbine/generator back to the required 60Hz (50Hz in Europe/UK).

I'm appalled at the attitude of Greece's creditors, their attitude is very short sighted and damaging IMO. I think they should accept that they will have to write-off a large proportion of the debt, in the same way that you or I would loose money through a bad investment decision. The necessary wealth creation ability simply doesn't exist, and is only made worse by effectively freezing the banking system. The losses should be fairly divided between both the creditors and debtors, it shouldn't all be on the debtors (IMO).

It's a misnomer to call it deflationary since the money supply is inflating and will eventually stop. If we ever enter into a situation where demand pushes the price up then that demand will be because the alternatives are less appealing. In that scenario people will indeed be reluctant to use bitcoin but they will use them to buy the things they need, so really there is no problem. Inflationary money is more about getting people to spend money before it diminishes in value, i.e. to buy things they don't necessarily need (in addition to the necessary things).
Basically, as you can probably tell by now, I'm of the view that inflationary money systems have been sold to us as the only way, but I believe they cause waste and that steady state money is a better way.

It's about what other miner's can handle. E.g. if there are some current miners on low(er) bandwidth connections, or with slower hardware for doing verifications then bad things start to happen if you give other miners the ability to mine, say, a 100MB block. Probably safer to up the limit a bit and see what happens, up it a bit more, etc. 
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:25:49
Sure. I think most miners will have a range of hardware, so some of their older and less efficient h/w might get switched on/off as prices fluctuate, but newer h/w is likely highly profitable even in the price dips, so overall I think most miners have plenty of profit margin slack. I suspect a big reason why this is so are the barriers to entry into the mining business - finding a source of cheap energy, and a supply of the latest generation of mining equipment at a good price... and all of that at scale. I don't imagine any of that is straightforward.
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:50:40
There are a few possible paths we could take:
1) Slow price growth that is more or less in-line with the reward halvings. When the reward halves, so does the money flowing to miners (assuming the price remains the same), and so does the energy consumption (approximately). So we can then double the price to get back to about the same amount of mining and the same power consumption.
2) Demand for bitcoin significantly outpaces the halving, thus pushing up the price. The growth in mining would reach a point where governments at various levels (central and local authorities) would get involved. Some would create new regulations limiting mining, maybe through issuing licences? Others would outright ban mining (imagine a city authority in China that controls the power grid).
All of these pressures would cause mining to move to mining friendly locations, i.e. in addition to the current pressures that push miners to cheap electricity, low cooling costs, good internet connection and friendly regulation (e.g. Iceland with its cool climate and geothermal power).
Those places won't have the power generation capacity to meet the demand, some increase in supply would occur but not enough to meet all of the demand. Hence the mining community would start investing in renewable power solutions - probably PV solar and some places that come to mind are Nevada, Spain, parts of China, Morocco(?), Turkey, Australia, Mexico. i.e. Sunny places with existing infrastructure and stable governments.

The power consumption would be become a PR and political issue.
All of that old mining hardware would become profitable, plus lots of new hardware would come on-stream fairly rapidly, pushing up the mining power consumption to a level at which it becomes very much noticed and possibly disruptive to the 'real' economy.

But really the losses occurred long ago, or rather, the wealth creating ability of those countries was not as high as the creditors thought it was.

Let's take another example. If I understand you correctly, in your model/view if a new power plant comes online and starts to provide electricity to the electricity grid, then all of the existing power plants continue to supply the same amount of power as before (and whatever CO2 footprint is associated with that), but now we also have the additional energy supply (and additional CO2 footprint) of the new plant. Is that an accurate description of your view?

Interesting idea. I suppose when a node accepts an incoming connection (or attempts an outbound connection) it could issue a challenge that requires the other end to prove access to a private key with funds. One problem there is that a DoS operator could still launch lots of nodes using the same key, so maybe a given node will only connect to other nodes if the key/address is unique among the nodes it's connected to.
So who/what decides the minimum amount of funds to pass the test? If you use a fixed small amount, then you have the same issue with the minimum fee setting, whereby as the value of BTC increases that fixed amount can very easily go from being worth not much to a lot.
@_date: 2015-07-17 07:56:58

As per my comment above, you're not considering second order effects on the bitcoin miners. If some party begins to mine at near zero electricity costs (or near zero marginal cost , i.e. e.g. there are minimal operating costs due to free fuel), then by mining you increase the mining difficulty, which in turn will cause miners elsewhere to shutdown as the cost of mining increases above the level of their profitability.

ok, good. So do you agree that by running a miner, Crusoe will cause the mining difficulty to increase? And therefore at the next difficulty adjustment some mining capacity elsewhere in the bitcoin network will power down to compensate for that?
Sorry for being persistent, but I'm really interested to know the root cause of the disagreement here.


I encourage you to re-read my post, I was making an analogy between the two systems, i.e. (i) the electrical power generation and distribution system, and (ii) the bitcoin mining network. The feedback mechanisms in those two systems operate very similarly, specifically, the feedback mechanism has the effect that any new supply into the network results in supply being switched off elsewhere in the system. That was the nub of my previous post.

So I think what you're saying is that it's the decentralised nature of the database that they're interested in. I.e. each bank (or whoever) has a fully copy of a database to query, but no one bank can say they have the master copy, they each have equal responsibility. And any attempt to create a block with a transaction that the other banks deem invalid creates a fork. That might be a single 'rogue' bank on one fork, or it might be a cartel of banks trying to defraud the others(?). Bitcoin handles this by requiring that you need lots of hash power to cheat, which makes it prohibitively expensive, or rather, you can make more money by just going with the rules and mining. Without that aspect of bitcoin I can see some pretty big cracks appearing, hence I still don't think I understand how this is all supposed to work.
@_date: 2016-09-20 19:27:15


Seems to me like there would be a strong incentive to cheat. E.g. customer info is often sold, and customers with better credit ratings are worth more than those with lower ratings.


Banks have a long history of finding ways to circumvent laws and regulations. In any case, this statement applies equally to any shared database, i.e. if we're saying that equitable behaviour occurs through legal bindings then why not just use a vanilla shared database?


That may be the case, but I'm still looking for use cases that actually hold water!
@_date: 2016-09-19 21:49:38


That's what I'm trying to get my head around... and I'm not succeeding. Assuming they're using proof-of-work, each party has to agree not to obtain more than their allotted/agreed mining power(?) If they do then the others either start an arms race, or more likely they just throw in the towel and say 'you broke the rules, fughetaboutit'. Or maybe they're planning to use proof of stake(?) Or....???
Hmm, so maybe they could just run on a nominal amount of mining power and kick out anyone who deviates from the alloted mining power, but how is that different to saying we will all have read and write access to a shared a ledger, and anyone trying to manipulate the ledger gets banned from using the system. With a blockchain there is a duplicated and synced ledger, but there are more efficient ways of doing that than a bitcoin like blockchain if you have trust, i.e. you don't need proof of work, or cryptopgraphic keys; so the link with blockchains gets a bit tenuous. Maybe that's it. Maybe they're just talking about some database synchronisation mechasnism inspired by bitcoin, but doesn't really have any of the key elements we associated with the bitcoin blockchain.

The actual limits are beyond the earth, e.g. the moon is only 1.3 light seconds away (2.6 for round trip), so mining is still feasible there in principle, e.g. if you had lots of really cheap energy from solar panels. Certainly any mining on mars would be impractical, and in fact I'm suspecting it would fork naturally, that is, nodes on mars would deem their known longest blockchain as the valid blockchain, and that would be different from the earth blockchain.

Not sure where that came from. The point is that the hash rate was more or less steady, therefore it would appear that the mining reward was in equilibrium with the mining cost. Therefore it's reasonable to expect a drop in hash rate when the reward halving occurred (or the price to rise, or a bit of both).
The fact that it didn't drop suggests a signifcant proportion of litecoin miners are using free electricity, and in turn that might have implications for bitcoin. Although I expect bitcoin mining power consumption dwarfs litecoin's.

I recently obtained a [bitnodes hardware]( node. It's been up for a few days now and the connection count has been steadily rising. The highest I've seen so far is 44.
I was idling thinking about why this number is what it is. The standard client makes 8 outbound connections, so on average a full node might expect a further 8 inbound connections from other full nodes, making a total of 16. 
Given that the count is quite a bit higher than 16 I guess that means there are some nodes that don't accept inbound connections (typically due to no port forwarded through the router), and therefore the 8 outbound connections they make get directed to those nodes that are accepting connections.
[Bitnodes]( records the number of full nodes accepting connections, and currently reports about 6000, but that doesn't include nodes not accepting connections. However we can estimate how many of those nodes there are (let's call them half nodes) by the connection count seen on a full node. 
half nodes per full node = (connectionCount-16) / 8
So in my case I get (39-16)/8 = 2.875 half nodes
Multiplying by the 6000 full nodes gives 17,250 half nodes, or 23,250 nodes in total.
Does this logic hold water? :)

Because without bitcoins there is no (or very limited) incentive to mine, hence the barrier to performing a 51% attack is very low, hence the information on the blockchain is not nearly as trustworthy as that on bitcoin's blockchain. E.g. consider the question - did this transaction really happen or not? Was it faked?

I'm the other way around - my interest in systems of money is what drew me to bitcoin. I do find it fascinating how complex a 'thing' money is, compared to how simple it is to use the vast majority of the time (for every day use).
It's a bit like the distinction between macro level physics and quantum physics, in that at the macro level everything is intuitive and works as you've always been led to be believe. But the deeper you go the more that surface level of reality drops away to something almost completely different.
Bitcoin is endlessly fascinating and I'd rate it as one of the world's most interesting social experiments right now, if not *the* most interesting.

Inflation proof in the sense that a given unit (e.g. a gram of gold) has a consistent real value over time, give or take. E.g. an ounce of gold in medieval Europe would have bought you a very nice/expensive outfit to wear ( a nice suit or a dress), the same holds true for an ounce today. (of course suits weren't a thing in medieval europe, but you get the idea).
No unit of fiat currency can make that claim. Most currencies fail over long periods, probably the longest we could go back for is 300 years or so with the the British pound(?)

1. The rise to $1200 was probably due to a highly illiquid market and dysfunction at mtgox. 
2. In the event of a crisis such as a collapse of the petrodollar system, anyone considering selling BTC will have to decide what to exchange them *for*. i.e. if dollars are considered a 'hot potato' for a while then the dollar exchange rate might increase by a lot, but for the very good reason that everyone is trying to dump them.
3. Higher valuation leads to higher money supply in purchasing power terms. The current 3600 new BTC mined per day will need to be matched by demand at the higher valuation.  I suspect things will get more interesting after a couple more reward halvings, at which time the annual BTC inflation rate will be very much lower than currently.

I suspect that would be a problem for nodes such as mine running on Odroids and Raspberry Pi level hardware. My node runs fine right now but it is CPU and IO limited, any intensive operations on the full blockchain would cause responsiveness to drop.

Metal and metal ore deposits fall in quality over time as the 'low hanging fruit' is depleted. Also energy is one of the main mining costs and energy isn't getting cheaper (yes we have a short term oil glut, but long term that situation will reverse). As for equities for the long term, at this point there's a fairly strong case to be made for the financial markets being highly dysfunctional, e.g. being propped up by Fed asset buying and cheap money fuelling buy-backs.
I agree that people should consider, e.g. investing in equities for the long term, but consider **very** wisely.

Perhaps I'm wrong that connection count by itself is a significant factor, since it depends on the protocol, e.g. whether multiple copies of a block are received and compared versus just getting one copy. Same goes for transaction propagation. 
Judging by the spiky bandwidth usage I suspect most bandwidth is from new (or old out of sync) nodes syncing up. That load is spread over all nodes that accept connections, so the more nodes the more the load is spread out. But if node ops start to throttle connection count and/or bandwidth then that load is pushed on to the remaining nodes, and that could eventually cause a cascade. Each node op in turn decides bandwidth is too high, and causes bandwidth for all other nodes to go up, they then decide bandwidth is too high, ad infinitum.

Having just calculated those rates they're far lower than I was expecting. E.g. right now I the uplink is at about 500kB/sec, downlink @ 53 kB/sec. If the numbers are right then I think there must be long quiet spells that bring the averages down.

In general a smooth transition is favourable to hard steps, e.g. the UK gov is currently under pressure over a cutting tax credits, and the issue is really the immediacy of the change rather than a smooth transition to a living wage. The same issue has come up with solar power subsidies - by cutting them off they're disrupting an entire industry that has built up around domestic solar. A slow ramp down over say 24 months would at least give those companies time to explore other business models, lay off people in stages, etc. At least the reward halvings are known in advance so everyone can plan accordingly. Some miners have effectively free electricity so just keep going no matter what, so the network will continue, but there are still enough unknowns to keep things interesting.

I have a lot of respect for Peter and the message he spreads about fiscal responsibility and such, but on this occasion I think he's very wrong resting entire view of bitcoin on this notion of intrinsic value that he himself can't pin down... because it's a flawed argument. The utility as money is the value, the end. That's always been the case for all forms of money. Yes some of them have had some value before they where money, but it's really tangential what's driving the monetary value.
People will grok this in time, my concern is it might take a few decades.

Bear in mind that a fork is essentially a partitioning of the existing nodes into two groups. If you have a node already it will have automatically switched to one of those groups. You can now either (A) switch your node to the other group or (B) start another node connected to the other group.
Which group you connect to will just depend on the version of core you're running (i.e. will it accept the blocks being created on a given blockchain) and the seed IP addresses you use.
If you have the private keys then you can dumpprivkey to get them out of a node, importprivkey into the other node, and now you have control over the two variants of your bitcoins on the two different blockchains. 
The type A and B bitcoins you have control of will then have their own independent transaction history controlled from your two distinct nodes/wallets. Make sense?

@_date: 2016-07-12 22:43:17
Right. The only strategy known to work is value investing, i.e. perform long term evaluations of how much some thing is worth (stocks, bitcoin, bonds, property, commodities, whatever) and buy them if they're offered cheaper than a reasonable valuation prices them at. To make the situation symmetrical you can also short stuff that's overvalued, but avoid leverage, i.e. buy put options rather than writing call options or taking an open ended short position.
Trading could work if you have more information than the market, e.g. maybe if you did some actual footwork investigation around some specific stocks, otherwise it's just zero sum minus trading costs. 
Evaluate. Buy. Hold.

I don't disagree. Sometimes it's said that people are ignorant of fractional reserve banking, and yet when they get spooked we get a bank run - so maybe they do really understand it. What I don't understand is what the point is when the interest rate is 0%; a real positive rate was compensation for the risk of fractional reserves, but now we have the risk with no compensation. OK there are protection schemes, but we all know in reality there would be conditions and delays to getting back money through those schemes.
Fractional reserve is basically trusting that someone else is a good investor of your money. The existing banking system as a whole has proven that it isn't a good investor - so what's the point of that aspect of it now? My philosophy is to use hard money for liquid reserves and invest the rest directly myself. Why defer responsibility to unknown people who have proven themselves to be really poor custodians of wealth at best, and criminally fraudulent and/or negligent at worst?

Yeh that's a nice way of approaching the problem because it inherently takes into account energy conversion efficiency. The various estimates working backwards from thrust power don't account for these conversion losses, or have to estimate them.
We know exactly the energy density of jet fuel, and the fuel tank capacity, so we can just work on that.

Coins don't exist on a node, ownership is determined by a chain of transactions on the blockchain. If a split occurs then there are effectively two blockchains, bitcoinA and bitcoinB, and you have access to your coins on both blockchains. I.e. the number of bitcoins has doubled (each bitcoin becomes a type A bitcoin and a type B bitcoin).

FYI you're out by a factor of 1000. 340,669,000W is 340 MW. 
[this answer]( suggests take-off power for a 747 is 90MW, which I assume is much higher than cruising power. But if we take the 90MW then bitcoin uses more power than one 747 at peak power.
Still really interesting to know bitcoin is in the same power ballpark  as a jumbo (within an order of magnitude).

.. If however you have BTC on an exchange, they may only accept/honour only one of the two types of bitcoin, so it's probably wise to hold the actual bitcoin yourself, but that's the general rule anyway. If you don't own the private keys they're not your bitcoins.

Yes! I would add that the h/w cost is amortized over time, such that over the long term the mining rate is predominantly determined by the price of electricity. 
Hmm, that said, with silicon fabrication still being a developing tech and one that is increasingly expensive (22-28nm ASICs anyone?!), maybe in the short to medium term the h/w cost will remain significant as h/w is made obsolete by new more power efficient ASICs every couple of years or so.
Either way that 16MW figure is wrong and highly misleading. Yet another party that doesn't understand bitcoin!

During the 07/08 crash gold initially fell as people tried to get back to 'safe' USD and to close open leveraged contracts, but after that initial phase gold was in demand. I can see the same sort of pattern again, with the distinction that we now has bitcoin as another asset class that isn't heavily invested in yet, so should there be a crash event (which given enough time is inevitable), it seems likely to me that bitcoin will be in demand and will rise in value significantly.

If the BTC price goes up then so does the incentive to mine, hence the power usage goes up too.

This bit is not right. At most a bank can only lend out the deposits it has, the increase in money supply comes about because your deposit account records you having $100 (say), but $90 of that has actually been lent to someone else - and is also recorded in *their* bank account. That is, the original money is double counted - and then triple counted, ad infinitum.
If you do the maths then you find that if the reserve requirement is N (expressed as a proportion from 0.0+ to 1.0) then the maximum amount of money created through lending is 1/N.
The fractional reserve refers to what fraction of the deposited money must be retained as a reserve. Only central banks create money from nothing (M0 or 'narrow') money, all other money is created through this 'double counting' facilitated by bank lending ('broad' money which is classified as M1 through M4).
As for bitcoins, you could in principle have a bitcoin account where the bank records your deposits, e.g. 100BTC, but there is no bitcoin address associated with the BTC, the account is purely a right to withdraw 100BTC. Meanwhile 90 of your BTC are transferred to someone else as a loan.
Hope that makes sense.

Presumably bitcoin would foster tertiary activities that deal in it, so no I don't agree with this point.

"Underpinning the value of gold is that if all else fails you can use it to make pretty things."
This is pretty dumb. Krugman didn't say this but he is putting it up there as backing to his argument. Gold has a number of qualities that together make it an attractive store of wealth (see  being pretty is one of them but not significant by itself and certainly not the major backing to it's value.
So basically Krugman doesn't understand gold despite it having been a stable store of wealth for centuries (with some bumps along the way), he also doesn't understand the bitcoin mining process, and yet appears happy to discuss his ignorance in public. 
Sorry Paul but this is just embarrassing. If you aren't sure how these things work then it may be worth finding out, and if you still don't understand then write about something else, otherwise your articles are just so much noise, or worse - trolling.

The block chain is simply a public record of who owns which bitcoins (or which addresses anyhow), it is not ownership of bitcoins, ownership of an address's private key denotes ownership of the coins associated with that private key's public address. But of course the owner of most addresses is unknown, only the likes of PRISM could work it out by analysing IP trace logs and requesting your identity from an ISP.

That's a narrow view IMO. We want a wide community of people to understand how bitcoins works, and if this one aspect of bitcoin was some relatively complex calculation taking into account second order dynamics then that would heighten the barrier to understanding overall. 
Also, for a more complex system it's harder to prove there aren't weird undesirable corner cases. Up to a point you can use mathematical proofs, but for complex population dynamics (such as a community of miners, mining coins with a volatile price) I'm not so sure.

Just to re-iterate what others have said. Formatting a HD typically means overwriting some of the structures that point to data but not the actual data. Therefore if the drive still exists,works OK and you haven't put lots of new files on it, then there's a very good chance at recovering the wallet. 
In that situation I would use a disk copy program to copy the disk image and to run any recovery software on another disk with the disk image copied onto it. That way if the recovery software barfs you can try again (with different software or whatever).
If you are not sure what the wallet password is but have a rough idea then there is a guy around here running a service that cracks passwords based trying combinations around what you think the password might be - it's pretty cool.

Indeed. Your average Joe isn't going to want or be able to manage a BTC wallet with all of his/her savings in it - they're going to end up having the wallet on their PC or smartphone with no backup or something equally dumb (e.g. acquire a trojan).
Also going forward I don't foresee every little transaction being recorded in the blockchain, it's just not feasible to have everyone who buys a sandwhich in China to have their 0.001 BTC purchase propagated and recorded over the whole network. More likely a non-BTC accounting system will layer on top and at the end of each day BTC banks will 'clear', that is, make payments between the banks that settle the aggregate xfers between the banks.

OK but how may central banks remove betting and currency exchange activity from estimates of money velocity? None. They just lump all transactions together as 'economic activity'.

If the overall tx rate grows over time that probably means adoption is progressing.

The attack involves attempting some common passwords on multiple accounts in order to find a few with weak passwords. The end result is zillions of locked accounts and maybe one or two hacked accounts if they had dumb passwords. With 2fa that's not even possible so chances are your account was a taret but no-one got access - but you just need to go through whatever process is required to unlock the account, e.g. contact support at mt.gox?
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:07:36


I agree. I was was thinking along the lines of the current norm which is to pay for everyday stuff with a VISA or Mastercard which is often linked directly to a current account. But on reflection, even in that world it makes sense to have a separate account that you use for everyday purchases, and to periodically xfer small amounts of cash into it.


Nah I was meaning that if you have a current account linked then you want access to be authorised for every single little purchase - want to buy a coke, type in your password (= PITA). Better to have a petty cash and little or no protection - e.g. if someone steals the card (or whatever it is) they get the cash, just like paper money today - but they don't get access to your main current account.

Yes but that equilibrium point is at a very high wattage if the price of bitcoin continues upwards. There is a direct relationship between total mining earnings and energy consumption. It boils down to the fact that the only running cost is energy, so the upper limit for network energy usage is whatever you can buy with the mining profits for the network as a whole.

"Bitcoin doesn't exist, except in the virtual world" - so, pretty much like every other currency then.

Yeh, the only way I could see direct BTC use going mainstream is if there were an smartphone app - which just sounds horribly insecure, e.g. presumably you'd need to authorise each purchase with a password or fingerprint - but people on the whole choose really bad passwords mainly out of convenience, and compared to handing over coins or notes it just sound s like hassle. Maybe prepaid cards with limited BTC on them could work though? Not secure but limited scope for loss, i.e. not tied to your current account with this month's salary in it!

Yup, it's simple maths. If you have 50% chance of finding a block then the chance of finding 2 in a row is 25%... and the chance of finding 6 in a row is 1 in 64.
