albacore_futures, financial markets aren't perfect - few human institutions are. But look at their track record as a leading indicator - so frequently, we see big ups and down movements in stock prices *before* some big development is revealed/disclosed. That alone makes prediction markets worth the effort to develop.

Augur's already released an alpha:
Online demo: 
Github:  (seems pretty darn active)
Their programmers are all public by name (Peterson, Krug, Calderon, Leonard) and they seem to be available most of the time for anyone's questions. 
I understand they chose Python/Ethereum because, among other things, it allows them to iterate/revise faster than people seem to be able to on bitcoin/c++. And indeed they have. So many bitcoin c++ projects (including just revisions and improvements) seem to take forever to come out, but they put together this alpha apparently in well within a year. Ethereum's power players generally seem much quicker to implement requested improvements to their network than bitcoin's.

And I don't mean to take away from that - I'm just pointing out that the scarcest resource these days isn't ideas. We have a surplus of them in crypto. The scarcest and most needed resources are skill and money.

One of the things I like about Augur is that they've been pretty transparent and consistent about, well, just about everything, including their identities. And, they're willing to put their money where their mouths are, which I guess is kind of fitting given the focus of their project (they really do seem to believe in the power of prediction markets to bring an end to empty talk, false claims and other assorted BS ).
Eragmus, seems to me you have a pre-existing animus toward Augur. That the case? If so, curious as to why. They always seem willing to address whatever concern or question is put before them - online or off - more than any other crypto project I've seen. And they identify themselves by their real name. They don't hide behind aliases. That's refreshing. So I don't get the cynicism. Are you involved with some competing interest?

One of the great things about Ethereum is that there's a real cohesive community behind it capable of coming to consensus fairly quickly and simply getting things done.

OP, cptmcclain, you're totally right - it's going to be really liberating (or humiliating or aggravating) depending on who you are, where you sit and what you've done (haven't done).

It's going to change everything if either team or both makes it work. The truth about what's going on and where things are really headed on every conceivable front that any large group of people care about will be a lot more transparent, a lot faster to those of us on the outside looking in.
In other words, a lot "fewer" insiders who can screw us, including politicians.

"Sounds to me like a 2-of-2 multisig scenario where party 1 holds the first signature and party 2, 3 and 4 each hold the second signature."
I think that's about right - is there a reliable online wallet service that arranges this sort of thing (Coinbase, Bitgo, someone else)? If not, how could I set this up?
@_date: 2015-06-26 07:22:52
So you're not offering to implement this, or much money to someone else to implement it - just an idea and a request for funds. Idea's good, but we need less ideas in crypto and more execution and the resources needed to enable that execution.

Mr. Vorhees, first of all thank you for everything you've done to enhance the ecosystem including today's very thoughtful and forward-looking open letter to the community. 
Your loss is a tragedy not just for you but for all of us because you've been a major investor in promising bitcoin startups - so the loss of the 550btc seems very likely to be a loss of investment that would have otherwise gone into further development of the ecosystem.
Question: why did you choose to put your 550btc in MtGox as opposed to other online wallets (like Coinbase) or a paper wallet? Just want to understand what was your thought process and the factors you took into consideration? 
It's shocking and, frankly, it's a mistake I'd very much like to learn from to perhaps re-examine my own thought process regarding such things. What was the thought process that took you in that direction when Mt. Gox's issues were fairly known by long-term bitcoin followers?

It looks like he was in a tight spot and dealing with a situation he never really expected to find himself in the best way that he could - create chaos? Or send a clear (but discreet) signal to everyone paying attention something was very wrong by simply resigning? It's what professionals do.
He clearly wanted to avoid messy confrontation and a circus. He tried to address things from the inside quietly and left when it was clear he'd be unable to do so without risking making the situation chaotically worse. 
Was it the best decision - debatable - but understandable and I admire his professional retraint and efforts to stay above the fray.

OKCoin - you really do need to shut up now before you dig yourselves into an even deeper hole. This is headed for court. Fix your finances (if that's even possible) in the meantime or you're Mt.Gox/Mintpal in a week or so.
Changpeng Zhao has no reason to lie and only got involved in this mess after you idiots dragged him into this. He's a paragon of virtue, professionalism and accomplishment compared to you clowns (just do a Google Search for his bio and what this guy accomplished at Bloomberg). He was right to leave.

kyletorpey: the title of this article should be "Conceptual Godfather Says Project Will Fail"
We don't know really know what anyone thinks (unless you're a telepath). We don't know what Sztorc really thinks, but we can glean from his actions - his constant pestering of Augur's devs and his recent announcement that he's available to help any devs wanting to build Truthcoin on Ethereum (in contradiction to what he's said previously about Ethereum being a doomed platform) - that he's perhaps worried Augur might not only succeed but succeed *because* he's not involved and succeed for the big reason he said he parted ways with them: *because* Augur decided to build now on Ethereum (against his recommendations) instead of just sitting around waiting who knows how long for bitcoin sidechains to be implemented.
Remember, Sztorc's not an impartial academic voice - he's a competitor of Augur.
His comments, so many of which dont offer substantive criticism or rebuttal of Augur's technical arguments, should be seen in that light.
This man, judging from his remarks here on reddit, does not seem to be interested in truth or serious debate about the merits/demerits of technical choices and technical differences - he seems to be mostly interested in getting attention, denigrating Augur and wasting the time of Augur's devs for his own purposes. I'd rather see joeykrug and tinybike programming and reporting updates to github, not deflecting silly spitballs.
The guy has attitude problems. Look at how *he* handles questions about *his* platform: 
Now, look at how Augur handles questions about its platform, here and in their blog posts.
Note the difference. This isn't a he-said/she-said. It's a he-argues/she-shrieks.
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:32:23
Seems to me, Mr. Sztorc, that if you were really so confident about Truthcoin and really so pessimistic about Augur, you wouldn't be trying to throw spitballs at Augur at every turn. 
Where's your substantive response to the data and analysis Augur presented here?:
You should be rejoicing in the emergence of decentralised prediction markets, instead of being petty. This stuff is too important to be petty about. Having more than one approach to building decentralized markets improves the odds that prediction markets will finally happen.

And after reading 
and this
I have a better understanding of Augur's point of view on what it's like having to deal with a guy like Mr. Sztorc. 
It's a trip. He's a real piece/proof of... work.
I especially like the parts where he dismisses Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's comments out of hand. That part's very entertaining. Must be quite comforting to think you have an unassailable monopoly on the truth of everything. Why bother with prediction markets, wisdom of the crowd and all that jazz? We could all just stop thinking and refer to Sztorcoin.

I think the general idea is people value what they pay for. Augur says in their blog that the oracles have to be people with a financial stake in maintaining the integrity of the system. Seems like a good idea.

I followed a lot of the interesting tc forum discussion on this - I took away from it that because bitcoin's source code is so tightly coupled, so that even minor changes can change/break so many other things, that trying to make all the changes required to turn it into a full-blown prediction market risked ballooning the attack surface. That and slower iteration just seemed to make it a much riskier, less fruitful proposition and more of a security headache to develop on bitcoin's source code than to develop on Ethereum's platform.
And, anyway, since when did it ever make sense to go with something harder or more time consuming for the sake of being harder or more time consuming rather than to do whatever's most effective and efficient? Unless bragging rights for masochism is a thing.

One thing I dont understand - the article suggests an issue Rootstock has with Ethereum is its use of its own token (ether) to enable the network, and that Rootstock wont have such a token --- and then it mentions that Rootstock has its own token.
I assume some kind of token crowdsale is coming. Feels like it.
