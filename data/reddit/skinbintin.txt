I learnt that early on back in the day. Never, ever rely on anyone else to secure your BTC.

Thanks mate

At least you didn't buy any. I bought some and have them on a damn thumb drive I can't for the life of me remember how to access. All I know is they are there, and right now they'd be truly life changing for my partner and I. 
Fuck me I wish I could get into that damn thing. It's painful just to think about.

One of those silly pass phrases that I can't remember and seem to have long thrown out whatever I likely jotted it down on. Have been through ever drawer in the house. Gone through countless external and internal drives and every cloud storage platform I can think of, but no where can I find that fucking pass phrases.

Omg image if that's it!

That's really similar to mine. I still have the thumb drive the wallet is on, well I think I do, I just can't for the life of me remember how to access the fucking thing. There's literally a life changing sum of money on a USB drive for my partner and I, that I can't fucking access. It saddens me every day pretty much. :(

Either 580 or 680. Can't remember witch. Date back to when a BTC was dirt cheap and a friend that was always in on shit early got me sorted with a wallet and guided me through attain some. Balance was built up on several small purchases until I lost interest. By the time they became of value I'd lost access to the wallet. :/

No idea. How short would it have to be for that to be possible on current hardware?

IPT and it's offshoots are run as a business.  The only motivation is money, and money alone.  
Don't ever feel safe and secure on that site. If the feds come knocking, you fan but those pricks will sell everyone up the river.  
They are also notorious for DDOS other private trackers, knocking them offline for extended periods. 
No private tracker is truly safe. But shit, I'd put IPT on the sake trust spectrum as the likes of BitSoup and SCC etc.

Yeah mate. Forgot the damn pass phrase and for the life of me can't find anywhere I may have taken a note of it. My GF would probably have zero debt and a good chunk towards a house if I could remember it, if not an entire house. Fucking depressing to even think about. 
I should frame it as a memento to what could have been. 
Although let's be honest, I'd have spent them years ago on a Pizza or something ;)

Just because a member of the team is being paid for their time, doesn't mean they can't get to them. 
In fact, it probably opens up doorways to intimidate them into breaking their silence. I mean, there's working on a tracker, then there's working on a tracker for financial gain.

No shit everyone has motives. But when a torrent tracker grows to the size of IPT and has lining the owners pockets as it's primary objective, you can bet your ass it's going to fall into the sights of the anti piracy groups in  a big way. This inherently makes it a dangerous place to be so trustworthy. Sure, dodgy torrents etc filtered out pretty quick, but it's far from being the bastion yourself and many others proclaim it to be. 
Seriously, just don't be so naive. Every castle crumbles eventually.

He's all of them combined.
