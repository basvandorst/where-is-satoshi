Drama queen, please stick to the facts.
The defense was repeatedly denied to submit facts or when asking the prosecution they were again denied facts.
And several weeks later some of those came to light, which didnt even made it to the papers.
BTW: 2% REALLY? Im aiming as high as you did and would say 90% with a 90% success rate. ;)

2FA should be mandatory, since they have to follow the same rules as financial institutions anyway...
Anyway both Stamp and Kraken have released a statement pretty soon after, that they are using it differently???
How do they use it, besides having a reasonable hotwallett?

BTW: Since you guys are on, are you offering bill payments again?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:32:44
I would, but since im myself a Kreuzberger, i wouldnt.

Prepaid card is not a credit card and can be without a name.
Anyway nothing about the transaction will be anonymous, everything leaves some kind of paper trail...

Wasnt this a known scammer site?!?
It wouldnt surprise me, when everything other than the micropayments are either kept or disputed through PP.
@_date: 2016-03-16 00:01:27
Not those scammers/spammers again and again:

"It is a proprietary itBit protocol, not blockchain based, but is derived off of blockchain. We will also not be using bitcoin as the native token it will be an itBit proprietary token."

A lot of people have been scammed by the proficient way of turning BTC to FIAT anonymously by Polish banks and their resellers.
@_date: 2015-08-03 23:01:23
They will use the blockchain, which is genius.
And not patenttrolled yet.

"But Mr Nilsson and others say it would be a pity if the Mt Gox saga ended in a narrow prosecution based on Saturday’s police allegations. In reality, they add, Mt Gox may represent the first in an entirely new genre of sophisticated cyber crime."

Its a protocol that keeps a not centralized ledger, that stores all the information.
Banks will just apply that genius invention to their antiquated systems like ACH, Swift, or SEPA.
If you have more questions, i can teach you. ;)

Yeah, you dont speak Czech.
That is just marketing for a tshirt, which slogan was sprayed on a cafe.

You know that you can tumble your coins indefinitely?
And props to those services.
@_date: 2015-07-27 02:54:16
So you basically take WBK or even worse mBank cards(that have been around for years), put your logo on them, strip your customers of their own attached bank account, exchange bitcoins for them and sell this as something revolutionary?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:04:17
Rather $4B.
The first value exchange was 2 pizzas for 10000BTC.

I dont think banks will ever use "the blockchain", instead they will just copy the concept. Citibank is even working on its own coin.

People != Banks
They want the full control and certainly dont want to be associated with drug dealers and criminals. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 09:31:51
For USD i would go with Bitfinex and Bitstamp verification process and whoever verifies you first gets your cash.
Although the fees of Finex would work much better in your case.
