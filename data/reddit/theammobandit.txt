I bought my first few BTC last month, could not be happier. The thing that drove me the most to buy them was the increase of options to spend them in the city I live. + It's become so much easier to trade and store them

I had the same problem this weekend. The thing is: It's weekend and banks don't send funds during the weekend. Your funds should be in your Coinbase wallet tomorrow

Fix your TSL or w/e is causing the redirect (guessing cloudflare is in between as well)

Add an API so that I can update my screenshare tool to upload images to Supload instead of Imgur

Using something my friend developed called FlameSnap. It's made for macOS/OS X and saves the images as retina images unlike other tools.

Doesn't the transaction time mess the whole thing up?

I can invest about 1K, since I don't have to worry about things anymore. So I guess i could try to buy BTC and see how the market goes. Reading all the replies, the ebst thing to do now is buy and don't go fiat when they drop 100 or more because they will rise again eventually, that is if I understand your replies correct

After buying them theursday I've already made enough profit to buy another bitcoin. Investing, as everybody is now advising, is the best thing you can do before you can't affort 1.
