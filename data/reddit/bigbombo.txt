You have no idea what you're talking about.  Plenty of traders beat the markets consistently over thousands of trades and I'm one of them.  This guy was an idiot and you're talking out of your ass.

You're a smug arrogant idiot with absolutely no idea what you're talking about lol.  Plenty of people make money day trading consistently over massive statistically valid samples.

Segwit is a freaking 2-4mb fork, and soft forks are preferable to hard forks always.

Thanks, this is reassuring.  And yep I figured it would be this hard and unlikely.  However for me buying from the OEM or at least Amazon.com directly was worth any slight delay or extra cost, when having coins hacked or stolen would be so catastrophic for me.  And honestly, who doesn't have 75%+ of their net worth in bitcoin, only crazy people :p

Decentralised.  The word you are looking for is decentralised.
Core is a stupid word for 150 devs working on open source code, and nobody in a position to make decisions / binding promises.

I'm not sure at all that Jiang Duo'er is Jihan's right hand man or involved with bitmain, thought he was a random mining investor.  Proof of this?

Right but if you order from a third party, they could install a physical spying device of some kind that could spy on your seed at a low level, eg intercepting the display.  I know this might sound a bit far fetched, but there's incredibly high tech spy stuff out there and the incentive is huge, FBI agents were imprisoned for trying to steal silkroad coins etc, we know they're not immune to the temptation.
I just see no reason not to order directly from Trezor / Ledger, or a very trusted third party like Amazon for this reason.  The low likelihood has to be balanced against the large amount of BTC these devices are typically used to store.

Well done guys!  I like the bulldog determination to being candid and calling him out, but also respect shown despite intense disagreements about the idea of bitcoin.
The only thing I'm upset about is that people always let these NYA guys get away with the claim that NYA has 95% of the hashrate, when Wang Chun of F2pool (12% hash) has committed to reneging on the agreement in writing many times.  He hasn't changed his coinbase because that would require a restart of his custom systems, and this is consistent and exactly what happened with litecoin segwit upgrade which he honored his word for.

Suggesting Bitcoin should possibly even consider switching to untested, unworkable vulnerable to Central  attack proof of stake is just as bad as suggesting to add inflation.  We don't mess with the fundamental properties of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-02 08:16:24
Title was intentionally sensationalist.  The more people that watch the interview (preferably the whole thing which is pretty damning anyway) and form their own conclusions, the better.

Inflation talk starts at 25:35 in case the timestamp doesn't work for some
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:55:52
So you're saying it's ok if we make it shit, as long as it's slightly less shit than the current fiat alternatives?  Users don't have to and will not stand for any change to either it's supply curve or it's censorship resistance.  We don't have to choose.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:12:59
Either what he said was damning (add inflation) or what he said was damning (change to hybrid POS) or what he said was damning (fuck around and tinker with the core rules in any way such that block rewards get distributed differently in any way for whatever reason).
You don't fuck around with bitcoins core tenets and rules.  The correct answer is "well, let ethereum etc knock themselves out and make all these wild changes and experiments, bitcoin stays simple with a low attack surface and immutable at all costs".  
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:51:13
The issue is with connection speeds over TOR, and the requirement that bitcoin be resistant to state attacks (which would require running nodes anonymously over TOR)

This is a really fantastic theory, nice thinking!

I would also like to know this.  I'm not a coder, but am considering making a github account and replying to some of the more obvious nonsense in his posts just because he's unfairly derailing this so hard.  Where is Jeff Garzik and what his his stance on all this??

Pos cannot work without infinite constant inflation, an unsavory  fact which Vlad and especially vitalik tiptoe around but have mentioned in round about ways.  Also it requires their centralised authority to ban bad actors balances / attacks.  Also the switch to pos on ethereum with it's centralised cult of personality will result in probably 3+ chains.  Aka it just doesn't work period and is a dumpster fire, suggesting it even be considered for Bitcoin is fucking riotous.  So sorry not sorry
