which exchange are you watching? i use bitstamp because it's the closest to coinbase's price and it only broke 700 twice. 
edit: now it's under 650 and still only broke 700 twice.

i'm saying the delay is a window where they could sell coins without shocking other exchanges then eventually pay off their own members. they can't do it all at once and if they sell too hard they lose a nice chunk of profit.

I didn't find insightful, her philosophy, it was poorly reasoned and reactionary to her upbringing, that gave more insight into her developing it than her rationality of it. It was droll, repetitive, two dimensional and the naturalistic foundation she gave in it was flat out wrong. What insight it *did* give me through reading was of the type of person who *would* find it insightful.

It's not up to you to tell people what to do with their btc, regardless of the causes or consequences. People will manage their wallets however they want to the detriment or benefit of value through aggregate transactions. Saying "this problem is no reason to cause a crash" is mere pleading for stability.

Rand's superman was completely dependent on society to function, in competition, detractors (another form of competition), market. Self-sufficiency didn't exist, they formed another society, everyone competed on essential equal terms. That situation being unstable is another subject; feudalism being a predictable outcome. Nietzsche's superman was out to conquer, not just the obstacles set by others, after that there was one's self. Zarathustra brought his message, conquered rejection then his acceptance. He didn't necessarily rely or *need* others for this, there were always obstacles to overcome. He was also self-sufficient in practice, not in a society where Rand relies on the voluntary delegation of work and commerce with others.

coinbase usually drags behind any swing when it's trending, for some reason it was ahead of the up trend by a bit and peaked at 711, that's when i pulled out. "Price per coin: $711.67" to be exact.
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:49:13
That looks like it struck a nerve. It's collapsing at the same time it's making headlines. ouch
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:34:49
i considered that, but with the delay in payment by mtgox there's not really an incentive to rush those coins along.

"became well known" is a bit subjective. he could have been well known among many circles previously and the citations only really support that he made a prediction and it was tracked, not that it caused him to *be* well known. i don't edit a lot, just nitpick on wording. i don't think i can even attempt to fix it because it's going to be to be revised so frequently.

initiated a buy of 3 at 350 on the 9th and it's scheduled to be completed on the 17th... apparently having a bank holiday in the middle of the fucking week interrupts their ability to count 4 business days. it hit 450 on friday... i'm a little ...irked, that they need 4 consecutive (not including weekends) business days to complete a transaction.

Just bitcoinity, which stays open, and coinbase, which gets refreshed when I have BTC or funds to work with. Because coinbase takes just over a week sometimes to transfer funds I have to take that into account. I was lucky that the buy finalised the same day as this rally from the huge dip last week, but now the sale of that finalises on Thursday, which isn't unreasonable. Trading over a week seems to be working anyway, it usually takes that long for the price to cover the buying/selling fees, sometimes it's pocket change, sometimes it's a month's worth of bills.

buy seized/seize coins, counter every buy with a sell, not enough to drive prices down in and of itself but to kill upward movement, wait for lowered morale to do most of the work.

Bitcoin is becoming an ever more acceptable method of payment. Unfortunately, one it's received, it doesn't remain bitcoin. Bitcoin is like a bucket, you're going to fill it and empty it eventually in time , but it would be a lot better without all the holes letting everything out.
