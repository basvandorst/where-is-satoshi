I tried using the "Exchange other coins to btc" function on the Mycelium wallet. Ive got a confirmed transaction showing with Coinbase but havent recieved the BTC yet. Its been 3 hours but if it works out I'll be back to let you know. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:50:10
Mycelium has replied and all is well. I have an unconfirmed transaction as of now. I'm not sure if there was a problem to begin with but be sure to select an account when using this feature anyway. Hopefully Mycelium will make this process more intuitive in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:01:30


I only have one account. 


Yes, exactly. 




There is no transaction id on the Mycelium end... Coinbase has sent an email showing where the BCH was sent. Maybe I need to find that info through Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:50:04
Ive just done the same. It's not intuitive, is it. I saw the confirmations on coinbase yet nothing on Mycelium yet. Sigh
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:34:50
I've found the relevent info and have sent it in. Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:06:17
The app alows you to send crypto from another wallet to be exchanged on their end without selecting an account for the BTC to be put into. It looks as though your account is selected when it is not.
 I'm sure they will fix this eventuality but until then I think everyone should be aware.

Price deflation is different than currency deflation. Prices of electronics have deflated because of lower demand. It was easy to sell flat screens when everyone was swiching from their tubes but now that everyone has one...

yes, BUT, the rate of inflation won't out pace the rate of economic activity. So it acts like a deflationary currency.

Look, I don't hate you because you love your sevitude. In your world the system works the way your reality describes it. Maybe you don't think it works perfectly, but is the best soultion to a functioning society. IDK exactly what you think is reality but it's different for everyone.

Everyone was planning a short war before ww1. Most people thought it would end before Christmas. Countries even strategised for this, thinking they would out last other economies. Most countries involved had to throw out the gold  standard and inflate the money supply to continue the war. The Aftermath of trying to get back to the gold standard and pay off the war debt was terrible. In fact I have read that leaders were afraid of world revolution had no one won the war.

I'm thinking the same. Everyone knows there's a good chance the price will go back up and if people think it's worth the gamble they will buy. Speculators will speculate and this isn't the last boom/bust.

I personally would love to hide my money from my government. They use it to kill innocent people all over the world. They are the criminals and they extort money from me buy force. The point however is not hiding income, it's not revealing my every purchase to them. It's creepy, and a clear violation of privacy.

please dont send money to mt gox. there is a good chance you wont see it ever again. Instead just wait a few more days until we find out wether or not they are solvent. The best advise would be to set up a Coinbase acct., wait for the correction and buy from there.

I have my bank acct info and credit card info stored in so many servers, it's scary. just yesterday I found a $75.91 charge from some kind of subscrption.

@_date: 2014-02-21 21:19:01
I personally am expecting the price to drop some more but this is all based on sentiment so I could be wrong. On mtgox: they moved their office two days ago to a virtual office. I'm a play it smart kind of guy and everything I see is screaming insolvency. Do what you like but the odds are nill.

There is a lot of cynicism going on here, but this is what you can expect from a hardend bitcoin crowd. Even if you have covered all your angles and have a legit model I personally still wouldn't use your service. And one more thing: I'm starting to get pissed by all these fly-by night start-ups that get robbed and are giving bitcoin a bad name. 
I'm not a fan of regulation, but we as a comunity sould self regulate with our bitcoins and our fiat.

well I'm happy you are being civil. The problem you are speaking of: "These types of governments could never work". i doubt we will ever see them in action because turkeys will never vote for christmas. I can however point you to a large nation that was voluntaryist/confederacy. The Iroquois nation worked fine for centuries. There were leaders and no rulers. There is a difference. The fact is we do have experience with the NAP, we use it everyday in our lives and when this principle is broken it is met with force.Many people think the NAP means pasificism, it is infact the opposite. I agree with you that this system will not work in this society but that's due to western culture not human nature.
A couple more points:
"The reality is you can point to some governments that don't work and some that do, but you can't point to any libertarian or anarcho-capitalist nation that is successful by any measure, and that's not an accident. "
You are right, there is a good reason why, and it is no accident. There has always been those in power whom want to keep that power. We all know that power corrupts. This really is a moot argument.
"If taxes were voluntary, nobody would pay them. If justice were not monopolized by the government, everyone would just subscribe to their own brand of justice where everything they themselves do is legal by definition."
Voluntary tax?lol well sure i guess. People do however give to charity and those whom believe in restricted government statisticly give more that those that believe this should be provided be the state. As far as justice: why couldn't there be courts? police? This doesn't have to be provided by the state.
Thanks for the reply BTW and you should read "Tragity and Hope" by Quigley. It's a very good account of the history of western civilization.

A few things. First, consumer demand IS low, take a look at  department store numbers before Christmas. Second, money is too expensive?! For who? Third, and this is the biggest problem I hav with the Keynesian model, you state that capitol needs to flow with economic growth (i share this belief) and then constrict the flow until we fall into a slump, then start pumping the money in. Giving the banks free, new money to pay off bad debt( crap-mortgage-backed securities, and even crappier T-Bills) doesn't spur economic growth. Don't tell me the money isn't free, 0.25% is FREE. Now I don't blame the Keynesian model on our woes, and I'm not sold on deflationary money either. But if you can't see that the current monetary policy is a classic pump and dumb then my friend you are very naive.
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:08:56
I'm pro bitcoin but deflation poses a problem we should all think about. For instance, my family owns a very small restaurant chain. during monatery deflation I would have to lower my prices and lower my employee's pay. even though purchasing power stays the same this would obviously cause problems. Iv'e asked my employees what they thought about being payed less when prices drop in this senerio and you can guess their response. People only want to get paid more, never less, no matter what the value is.

@_date: 2014-02-21 22:11:24
Stockholm syndrome, or capture-bonding, is a psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy and have positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending them. These feelings are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims, who essentially mistake a lack of abuse from their captors for an act of kindness.[1][2] The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly 8% of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.[3]

In order to sustain a government you must control three things. I have heard of these "things" to be the three pillars of power:
1. the monopoly of information (thank you internet)
2. the monopoly of money (bitcoin?)
3. the monopoly of violence (?)
eventually i hope people will figure out that there is no need for centralized government and decide to drop out

Ever heard of MMT? These guys think they can go on forever with interest rates at zero. They even think a zero interest rate is the "natural" rate. The theory is that we can just print money for everything and the debt doesn't matter. I don't agree with this because printing is a tax and a truly underhanded one at that. Return on savings is so dismal that we don't do it and instead are forced to gamble in 401ks. Easy money creates bad investment and waste. Wealth gets taken from the middle classes and is in fact distributed to the rich. The most interesting thing I've learned from MMT is that if we paid off our government debt or even put a good dent in it, the economy would crash due to deflation. There would be 20 trillion less floating around in our economy to play with if we paid off our debt and the current system can't handle that. 
There's only one direction to go in our current system and that is more debt. So we're stuck in this crazy system where, when times are uncertain, and we are paying our personal debt off instead of investing in new ventures, the dollar contracts and makes matters worse. If we take out more loans and can't pay them off the debt bubble bursts. If the fed prints to offset deflation the interest, in dollars, goes up until we reach a period where we need to print to pay interest and we hyper inflate. We have painted ourselves into a corner. I believe that we can stay in the corner for a very long time but eventually the whole system will unravel.
