Thanks man!

Yeah it is, it's been mostly focused on dev and design but I've been bitten by the Bitcoin bug so I'm documenting all the info I find useful as I go down the rabbit hole.

Haha true! You know what they say though; Money doesn't buy taste.

I think it's also important to bear the context in mind. In 2008 Zimbabwe had an inflation rate of 231,150,888.87%. 231 Million Percent! 20% up and down with the general trend being up is pretty compelling

I live in South Africa and have a lot of Zimbabwean friends. BTC is offering an exit option to people who are being failed by their state. This is going to be interesting to watch over the next few months

Not sure I agree with Snowden on this one. Right now Bitcoin isn't terribly private but there are a number of developments in the works that should improve that.

Diet bitcoin, make your wallet lighter in 3 easy steps.

Guess there wasn't such a rush to double the blocksize after all...
@_date: 2018-03-26 09:54:14
Haha, that comment made my day!

Interesting. There are definitely issues with the quality of the data. Is there any evidence that this is deliberate attempts to manipulate the market? Most of those issues could reasonably be attributed to incompetence/limited resources. If there is evidence of deliberate manipulation that's another story

Sorry you are right, hit submit a bit early and can't edit headline now.

I think it's actually reasonable for these platforms to be conservative until the law is more clear and they have processes in place to handle all the scams and fake accounts. The same thing happened in the betting industry.

Yep, deleted and reposted with more appropriate headline.

3 years ago it would have been major news if 1% of Americans HEARD about crypto. Lets not forget how far we have come

No, lightning is a layer 2 solution on top of another blockchain (Bitcoin, litecoin etc). It allows secure 2 way channels that lets users send funds between each other without committing every transaction to the blockchain. It's mainly a scaling solution that has a few side benefits (cross chain atomic swaps being the most interesting in my opinion)

Sounds very dramatic but there wasn't a single shred of evidence in that whole article.

True but they are targeting dozens of platforms which could have a bigger knock on effect for crypto investors
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:06:28
Ledger does it too.

Good luck! I spoke at an investment conference in Namibia the other day and everybody was talking about a German consultant that had recently come to speak to their minister of finance telling them to ban all crypto. The more people we have fighting the good fight the better!

True, each channel is bidirectional and can be chained so 2 users can send fund between each other without a channel directly between them

LHV also recently had a launch event in London specifically geared towards crypto businesses. Very positive signs all around in terms of banking support for crypto businesses.
