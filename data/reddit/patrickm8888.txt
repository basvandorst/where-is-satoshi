Pretty sure federal anti money laundering regulations are a bit more important to them than a law you can't even reference.

I don't need to ever panic sell, because I removed all emotional attachment when I sold off my initial principal when at $10,000. Did it suck watching it shoot up to $20,000 right after? Sure. FOMO can be a powerful feeling too. 
But at this point, I am and will forever be 100% in profit unless I somehow lose all my bitcoin or it becomes worthless. Which means I have nothing to panic over.

I have no idea if the op is involved in anything illegal. I do know that a bank flips their shit if I try to do anything that involves more than about 1 zero. 
What law were you referencing? You claimed gdax is doing something illegal, so you tell us.

So which part of that copy pasta is the part that demonstrates that coinbase is doing something illegal?

Ok. Except the US taxes it's citizens regardless of if they leave or not. And most people do not have the means to renounce their citizenship(which the US will also tax you for) and obtain another.

Plenty of legal ways to reduce and avoid taxes. They all depend on many variables though, none of which are possible to know from your question.
If you have a million in crypto assets, you can afford to pay a knowledgeable expert on tax avoidance on how to reduce your tax burden.

I don't know if it's frequently. Some days it might be 10 trades, but there are plenty of days where I don't find anything that I like. Last night, I think I did 20+ trades for about +.01 btc. I usually make the most btc when the btc price is dropping.
I trade on and across about a dozen exchanges. Sadly, one of my favorites and most profitable(A Chinese exchange) got killed at the end of October. 
I would prefer not to name specifics. I trade on some pretty sketchy shit exchanges(Russian ones), which I would not want to be responsible for anyone else taking the risk on. I've gotten burned a few times on them, but that's part of the risk/reward ratio. And I am not recommending or advising anyone to do anything-- other than what works for them-- I just happened to find a sort of niche that works for me.
Fees need to be taken into account before making the trades of course.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:24:34
The prices do correct. Take for example a situation where the spread between bids and asks is significant. There can be a window of time where you work both sides, buying and very quickly filling sell orders at a higher price. That usually doesn't last very long. I did it for about an hour last night.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:22:28
For that to be true, then everyone I bought from had to be selling at a loss. Which is possible, but not likely. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:02:23
And how is "hodl"ing any different? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:59:23
I don't know... too many I'm sure. I don't track it. I get obsessive about it. I also enjoy it. I've done worse things to earn a dollar either way. 
I'm actually at 1.14, and I spent .1 on a transaction in September. 
My biggest gain was when the announcements about Chinese exchanges shutting down came out. It wasn't long after I started. I think I doubled my bitcoin holding in a few days then.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:06:07
Yeah I'm not really arguing anything, other than do what works best for your goals and comfort level.

I bought an index fund in the early 2000s. It's worth the same today as it was then!

Just temporary market inefficiency. Bitcoin was just the base currency. I was buying and selling an altcoin with and for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:19:08


Aside from Bitcoin, and less than 1 ether(which I am not counting in the Bitcoin number, and is basically the same price as when I bought), the only coins I have held longer than a few days are iota(a couple months. Dumped at a loss) and some omg for a few days(profitable, but don't recall how much). Those were both in my buy and hold days when I first started, and trying to speculate.
Sometimes I am buying and placing sell orders immediately after, taking advantage of the spread, working both sides of the order book. I did that last night with ONT for example. Pretty easy to make +5% or more in a matter of minutes when those conditions exist(they never last long).
Other times I am purposefully manipulating other people's trading bots to move the price to where I want it.

If for some reason he ends up with nothing but a house, no job or any other money, he has half a million in equity he can borrow, thereby having the same result as those suggesting he carry a mortgage in the first place.

I haven't cashed anything out yet. I will take my principal out when I either have 1.5 btc or btc/USD hits 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:16:42
Let's say his $1m in btc is worth $3m in 2 years. 
That means if he sells half now, in 2 years he has a house, and $1.5m btc. And potential appreciation on the house. 
Or, btc could be worth nothing in 2 years, and he has a house.

Main thing for me is not jumping too quickly into a trade. I still make that mistake from time to time though. And not getting greedy. I look for sure things, and not speculation.
If it's profitable I will take it, even if it's small. 
I try to minimize risk as much as possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:00:37

But by that notion people who "hodl" are lucky that the value goes up. They could also be unlucky.

Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate because the income has already been taxed. It's also better to have funds invested and growing businesses than sitting under people's mattresses.

Sounds like the upside to dodging taxes in Norway are pretty much in your favor. 60% if you get caught vs how much if you pay? What are the chances you get caught? And if you get convicted and go to prison in Norway, how long is that? A few years in some weekend jail?

Worst mistake I have made was forgetting a large buy order open for DRACo(total shit coin). I got wrecked when Bittrex announced it was being delisted. Ended up with a large bag and dumped it at a 3rd of the price. 
I still made that back though. Delistings are very profitable.

Most of it was thanks to the chaos that the "China bans Bitcoin" announcements caused. Those were great days for me. I pretty much doubled what I had in about 3 days then.
It's been much slower since.
If I sold right now, I would have 2.2x the amount of my initial cash investment.

The part that is ignored in the gospel of index funds, are the massive shits the market takes about every 5-10 years which basically sends people back to square one. They always just hype of the "historically the market has provided x% returns so if you do this, then this happens"

I've been hearing "just buy and hold index mutual funds, and if you invested just a couple thousand a year.. you'd have millions!" For about 20 years now. 
But strangely, the statement is always based on figurative examples of hypothetical investments. Where are the real life case studies? It's been long enough. Show me the people who did this and retired with their millions.
If they actually existed, am I to believe Vanguard wouldn't be plastering their faces everywhere in marketing?

Today, I started trading at 3:30 pm, and it's now 7pm. I think I am done for the day.
I started trading with .1395286 btc
My ending balance is .14878372 btc
I never had a position larger than .03 btc(in the coin I was trading)
Longest open position was about 5 minutes. Most trades were under 1 minute round trip.

I have no idea what other people do, or if they suck at it or not. I suppose maybe they do. All I know is my own experience with it. It's definitely high risk, but crypto is high risk regardless. I have friends ask me to trade for them, and I refuse.


I'm not sure what you mean by this. I don't do anything constantly. I find trades that work for me. By working for me, I mean will make me more bitcoin. My goal is to have more btc, without spending more fiat. 
I only hold bitcoin, and a small amount of eth(A remnant from my speculative "hodl" days). 
My personal experiences with holding other coins is where I lost the most. Iota for example. I finally exited that position a couple days ago after months. 
What I do isn't really lucky at all. Luck is random chance. I don't do random. Is what I do risky? Yes. It's not chance though. You can not do anything to increase luck or mitigate risk on a roulette table or lottery. If I lose on a trade, it's because I  made a mistake. If I gain it was a purposeful choice.

My comment was replying to the notion that it is "always advised" to do one thing(also this hodl term is juvenile and reminds me of when "teh" was a thing). 
I think people should do what makes sense for them. 
Dogmatically adhering to the same general Boglehead buy and hold forever mantra, which bizarrely enough doesn't really hold true in the traditional investment world either, isn't always the answer.
