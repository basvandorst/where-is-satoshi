What about older versions of bitcoin core. I used that to create my original wallets

From the comments:
*The payee publishes a public key of theirs, which will be a long-standing identifier, public key = 'Q', corresponding private key = 'd'.*
*To pay them, payee generate a keypair, private key = 'e' public key of 'P'. Publish 'P' in the transaction.*
*The payer can calculate S = eQ, where S is a shared secret between payer/payee. The payee calculates the same S as S = dP. So the payee sees 'P' in a transaction, and multiplies by their private key, to get S.*
*Now that we have the shared secret, either side can calculate an offset to Q which becomes the pay-to-address. When you say BIP32-style derivation, Q' = H(S) + Q, does this mean Q + SHA256(33-byte S)?*
*A payee has to check each transaction (or every transaction of a fixed prefix) with 'P', calculate Q' = Q + H(dP) and see if that transaction pays to Q'. If the address matches, then the payee can spend it with private key of d + H(dP).*
*One downside is that you have to hold your private key in memory unencrypted in order to identify new payments coming in. So stealth-addresses may not be suitable for receiving eCommerce payments, since you can't implement a corresponding watch-only wallet, e.g. there's no way to "direct-deposit into cold storage."*

Can these ever be used?
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:43:29
I don't think so.  I also don't think he's cracking the encryption.  I think he's brute forcing the wallet based on the parts of the password you gave him.  So basically, if your password is "incorrect horse batteries", you tell him you think has something to do with "correct horse battery" and he guesses every combination until he figures one out that works.

Thanks for your help, I'm trying to run it in with prune=1000. I'm not sure if this only works after the entire blockchain history has been downloaded though.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:55:20
I thought that Bitcoin-qt ~~uses a deterministic method to generate~~ stores new addresses up to 100?
Just to be clear, I have an old wallet back up from 2013. When I tried to check balances last time without downloading the entire chain history. I generated new addresses using this wallet.dat file and it generated the same addresses that I used years ago. I thought that as long as I use 100 or under addresses with the wallet, I will be able to regenerate them again.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:46:21
So it should prune while downloading? Making the file size no greater than 1,000 mb?
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:07:54
Thank you very much. I will give this a try now.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:50:10
I tried creating new receiving addresses using my wallet.dat and checking the addresses on blockchain.info. I do not see any balances, even for addresses where I had transactions showing up on my Overview tab in Bitcoin-QT.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:01:20
thanks for your help
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:59:42
I believe I'm using an old wallet that had the pool of 100 addresses. Is there any way I can export those addresses and check the balances? I don't need to download the entire historical chain. I just want to check the static balances today and know that I'm the only one with those private keys.
If the ever comes where I want to withdraw the coins, I'll have to download the whole blockchain then.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:45:53
Thanks, I don't know the addresses with balances, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:02:20
I basically want to do a -listreceivedbyaddress without downloading the entire chain.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:17:12
Thanks for your help. I'm able to see some balances now, but only by manually creating new receiving by addresses and checking with blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-02-24 01:20:56
[Also, I believe this is one of my addresses.  Do you know why the debits and the credits don't add up.](
Says, 22 bitcoins received, 11.8 bitcoins sent, balance = zero.

@_date: 2013-12-18 14:31:32
so are people not actually short?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:38:21
This isn't he worst thing to be honest.  It's not like BTC-E is a regulated exchange.  It's almost like you're trading in a daytrading shop.  A lot of times these daytrading shops will allow you to short [unshortable stocks](  When they do this, they often allow you to do this by borrowing shares someone else at the shop owns.  Usually, when this happens, the person who is already long cannot get out while you or short, or vice versa... if they close their long you are automatically covered at the same time.  
All this means is that people are panic selling and BTC-E can't locate coins to get you short.  To be honest, I'm happy they are staying market neutral rather than taking the other side of your trade.  Even though it sucks you can't short this happens all the time on stocks that are going down like crazy.  
If in fact BTC-E took the other side of your short trade and allowed you to stay short they would be long while holding a falling knife.  If they got hurt too badly they could get insolvent and that's a credit risk.  I'm not flipping out as badly as the rest of you about this action at BTC-E.  That being said, I keep all my BTC and LTC in cold storage as soon as possible.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:43:09
not really, this happens in the us equities market as well
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:44:01
What about a paper wallet?  Isn't there a risk that bitcoin-qt could have backdoors?
@_date: 2013-02-24 01:22:41
I believe I created the address and transferred my balance to that address.  Then I lost my wallet. Did the address that has my balance in my wallet, even though I created it after backing it up?

@_date: 2013-02-24 01:05:16
If I asked my bitcoin client to create a new address, then transferred the coins to this address, it is lost?
I thought there were prestored addresses in the wallet?
@_date: 2013-02-24 01:18:46
I lost my old wallet, so basically I have nothing as of now.  I have not done more than 100 things since the last backup, I think it's been like 20 **at most.**
I created a backup pretty shortly after downloading bitcoin QT.  Since then I forgot about it and never backed up the wallet.  I restored my PC and lost about 5 bitcoins accidentally.  I do have that original backup that I made though.  I am currently synchronizing with network but I think I may have lost everything.
