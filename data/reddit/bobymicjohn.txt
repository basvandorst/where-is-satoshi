Just use your log in info from Coinbase on GDAX or vice versa! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:01:54
No problem. Big tip: Coinbase is tailored to newer users. It’s very user friendly and intuitive. GDAX is tailored toward more experienced users. It provides more highly customizable trade orders. However, GDAX has much CHEAPER FEES! 
You can instantly move any currency between your Coinbase and GDAX wallet for free. So I would suggest learning how to use GDAX to save yourself on those fees!

Hmm.... see, I’ve read all the books, papers etc. that there are to read on the subject, and I can’t see any flaws in SPV that make it any more risky for merchants than Satoshi originally describes in his writings (see nakamoto studies institute). 
Additionally, I also have a background in networking and software engineering. While I agree that other major networking systems scale via *encapsulating* layers, LN does no such thing, and in fact can work with any cryptocurrency featuring 2-of-2 multisig transactions (pretty much all of them). This makes me very weary. 
How does Bitcoin practically control inflation when the network everyone actually uses to transact on (lighting) can be backed by any old 2-of-2 multisig?

What? Can't do your thinking on your own?
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:46:43
Wasn't it supposed to be a debate?
@_date: 2018-09-26 03:49:16
Yes. 0-conf lives on in BCash, however. Hard to argue this wasn’t the original design. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:36:08
I plan on taking a go at it if no one else had done it yet. I know this may get me burried in downvotes, but Im actually a bit of a big blocker. Regardless, if anyone here would like to team up, we can easily make it a BCH and BTC block explorer. I own both and am happy to support both scaling experiments =)
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:25:28
Much better, but still a bit different of a situation in my humble opinion.
Also, satoshi isn't the inventor of Blockchain. The idea of merkle trees and using them as a database had been around for a while. Satoshi just figured out a way to use Blockchains, Proof-of-Work, and numerous other bits and pieces of technology, game theory, and economics (all of which others invented first) together to produce a solution to creating a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution - Bitcoin.

Lol, I’d hardly compare people working 2 versions of Microsoft Windows apart in history, to a pair of people working during and after the industrial revolution... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:47:14
Honestly I don’t. The basics are easy enough to figure out. I never got into automatic trade orders or anything like that. 
I must admit I don’t actually have a Coinbase/GDAX account at the moment. My account has been inexplicably closed twice. One day I opened my account and was greeted with a message saying I had to withdraw my funds and then my account would be closed. After receiving no explanation or response from customer service I simply opened a new account under a new email address. Second account got verified and worked for ~6 months before it too was closed. 
No idea what ToS I’m violating (if any). I didn’t do much with those accounts other than buy / sell coins then send them to my personal wallet. 
Anyway, I think this experience is worth noting. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:38:41
Now that’s what I’m talking about. A bit more than I was looking for, but that’s awesome. 
I once worked for a company that did VR rendering of brain cells / neurons in 3D, and now I’m having some seriously cool ideas involving exploring the blockchain like that. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:55:23
The average user shouldn't have to research the technology in their free time to understand the block explorers they do occasionally have to use. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:19:53
What? You just restated what I said.
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:55:58
Another - and probably more important - problem with current explorers is the lack of visual illustration of the double-entry bookkeeping system in a way that makes it intuitively easy for the average user to hop on and track their funds. I've been using and researching Bitcoin since like 2012 and I still find myself getting lost in block explorers while trying to keep track of addresses, tx ids, etc.
I don't have a solution for this, but I think we really need one.
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:48:26
Lol except it doesn’t, because if you actually read the whole thread and the one Satoshi references, you would instantly realize they were talking about concerns over the storage and bandwidth pressures of users storing and processing the whole blockchain - something both mining and non mining nodes must do. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:33:40
Well, then you don't understand what a blockchain is. Research merkle trees for a good start. 
A blockchain is simply a database where data is stored in sequential blocks of data, where each sequential block is built using the hash of the previous block. 
This was around years before Satoshi.
He simply used that in accordance with Proof-of-Work (probably being the most important bit) and other game/economic theories to build a peer-2-peer currency.
Here's a proof-of-work reading rabbit hole, if you are interested: [ [ [ [

@_date: 2018-09-26 03:41:56
It doesn’t matter if he meant node or miner - but it did mean the same thing today as it did then. 
This comment was in regards to the bandwidth and storage requirements necessary to store and validate the whole blockchain. He clearly didn’t intend users to run their own node, mining or not. I watched this lie slowly take hold starting around 2015 when the blocksize debate started. 
Bcash supporters seem to be the only ones to understand the original design, game theory, and most importantly economics behind Satoshis original design. 
Now, whether that game theory etc. (which is not a science), was the best approach to global digital peer-2-peer money, is yet to be proven. The majority of Bitcoin developers and miners seem to think otherwise. 
Perhaps they’ve learned something Satoshi didn’t spot. I’m yet to see articulated any rebuttal to Satoshis original theories that have convinced me his design won’t work. That being said, I also haven’t seen sufficient evidence that his original design is sufficient to secure the network at scale. 
I’m not convinced either way. But I’m glad both are putting their theories to the test. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 00:59:51
Except this post by Satoshi describes the BCH approach, not the current Bitcoin... Current BTC developers believe every user running their own node is critical to the security of the network. Here satoshi clearly says that is only the initial state of the network and not how he envisioned it should scale. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:21:24
Imagine how those of us who have been here since 2011 feel... 
No matter what side you are on, it is hard to hold faith in a system that has irrefutably generated so much uncertainty over its very nature. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:44:38
Interesting. So you can check the address balance in block explorer, but it doesn't actually appear in the Copay wallet?
I don't know what Bitpay's policy on the fork was, but it would be my guess that you probably missed your window to withdrawal the BCH. Bitpay has probably claimed the funds for themselves, even if they haven't moved them from the address yet. 
You may want to see if Copay provides a way to export your BCH private keys. If so, you could load them into Electron Cash and send the BCH to an exchange or whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:23:05
Bitcoin.com wallet should recognize any address type. Also, Bitpay should be able to send coins to any address type. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:10:33
Your bitcoin.com wallet address starts with a C? The wallet you are sending coins to does not need to recognize the address of the wallet you are sending from. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:27:24
So when you copy your Bitcoin.com wallet address (should start with a q) into Bitpay, it tells you it is an invalid address?
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:00:24
Cool, if you need any help or have any specific questions, let me know. I'd be happy to help where I can.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:06:49
Exactly. Though I can easily imagine a future in which those incentives shift. We worry about Bitmain’s influence now, but if crypto really takes off, it’s the big hardware guys we will have to worry about. Bitmain is still small fish to them. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:35:57
A run for their money is an understatement. If NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel got into the game, they could dwarf Bitmain overnight. 
Check out this recent Unchained Podcast where an ASIC manufacturer discusses exactly this.

That’s why there’s BCash - Bitcoin you can actually use. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:13:24
I simply disagree in the necessity of having many full nodes running on the network to prevent miners from hard-forking. Even if a large enough group of miners decides to hard-fork and mint themselves coins, it totally undermines the trust and strength of the network, essentially making their profits worth little to none of what they would be if they just played fair.
Run a full node if you trust no one. It is the only way to use bitcoin in its most pure trustless form.
Clearly many people believe that running a full node adds to the strength of the network, but I simply don't see how. So it will not work as a valid point in attempting to show me why we need a 2nd layer instead of growing on-chain.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:46:58
Clearly nodes would use more bandwidth, and clearly this is a valuable resource. 
However, the way I see it, this is only added value to the network as a whole. 
Sure, moving or storing that much data is a challenge, but I have yet to be shown that it will even still be a challenge by the time it actually matters, much less be a challenge we can’t solve without going off-chain. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:46:07
I'm not here trying to say everything I believe is correct. Just having a conversation and giving myself a chance to be convinced. I try to keep an open mind and always see things from both sides.
I have been back and forth on how I felt about the BCH hard fork. (I am **NOT** back and forth about how i feel about the censorship and general attitudes of participants in this subreddit). I own both, and I am excited about the potentials of both networks. I am in no way a maximalist for any one coin.
I came here and posted this because I felt I fully understood the protocol, the network, and the forces at play, but still didn't see the necessity of the 2nd layer. My hopes in having this discussion is that people could provide me new evidence, or explain things in a way that perhaps changed my perception of the issues at hand - which, believe it or not, has happened.
I'm only replying to you to try to show you exactly where I was coming from, and because I think the entire crypto community needs a lot more genuine discussion and a lot less toxic, cut-throat attitudes like yours.

It's a good point. That is why I did not attempt to refute it. 
Many times have a dreamed of Bitcoin nodes in orbit around the earth. I'm just not sure it is a challenge that technology couldn't tackle in the near future. All things crypto aside: I imagine a world where sattelites, anonymizing protocols like tor, and meshnets can provide bandwith and speeds that make today's speeds look like telegram.
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:25:19
Agreed. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:05:18
Care to explain how?
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:23:31
Never did I claim any of that. But realistically 40GB is not very much now and in the decades it will take to reach Visa level adoption - even at a fraction of Moore’s Law - will cost next to nothing. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:48:14
I didn’t dismiss any arguments because of the white paper. I refuted arguments I disagreed with, and pointed to the white paper as underlying evidence supporting my belief. 
I don’t believe running a full node is necessary for anyone other than very large merchants and miners. I understand why some think otherwise, but after reviewing everything in depth, I simply disagree. If you want to investigate things for yourself and present actual technical arguments, do that. Don’t throw an empty analogy at me with 0 supporting evidence. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:50:52
“On-chain scaling records all transactions”. Yeah, when I first bought Bitcoin in 2011 that was sort of one of its major selling points...
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:50:43
Actually, Satoshi fully acknowledges that mining will become industrialized. It was all part of the plan.

Yes, I understand how the lighting network works. It seems we simply value various aspects of the blockchain and lighting network differently. To me, there is just something about the elegance of the blockchain. Perhaps I’m just an idealist and 2nd layer is reality hitting me in the face. Anyway, thank you for actually being civil. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:00:54
No, it sounds like *you* want to restrict to things literally in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:12:36
Yes but every node doesn’t need to. More non mining nodes just means transactions must bounce around more before being actually put onto the blockchain - slowing down the network. 
The miners self incentivize each other to play fair. That is the key idea behind the proof of work system. If you don’t believe that then you should be convincing me we need to move to PoS.

Looking for a technical discussion, not baseless analogies to cavemen. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:05:06
I certainly don’t agree that no one uses “bcash”. Since the hard fork I’ve bought: an antminer s9, several beers, a sweatshirt, and 3 rx 580 GPUs with BCH. I would have used bitcoin but the merchants don’t accept it because it simply wasn’t  viable for buying/selling things. 
Merchants needing to use full nodes is certainly a good reason for nodes to be fast and have low storage needs. I hadn’t thought about this point in depth. 
So a merchant who wants to accept a reasonable number of transactions (or at 0-conf?) realistically needs a node in order to verify payments. 
So every corner coffee shop that wants to verify someone actually paid for their coffee without waiting 10+ minutes needs to run full node? Doesn’t seem viable at even Visa levels of scaling. Merchants could feasibly use a trusted service to verify payments for them, but then  they pay the same fees as visa and were back almost where we started. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:48:24
Assuming 40 GB of data is even still a significant or expensive amount of storage by the time Bitcoin reaches Visa level use: why is this a bad thing? Full nodes should only be run by miners, who, by the time bitcoin ever reached such a massive scale would be massively industrialized and 40GB of data a day even at 40$ (it will be more around 0.004$ by then) this is pocket change. 
I can see that storing the ever growing Blockchain is a challenge, but I fail to see how it breaks on-chain scaling all together. 
If there is an additional point here I am not considering please enlighten me. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:36:28
The white paper explains why Satoshi thinks there is no incentive for miners to maliciously change the protocol to their benefit. So far the network has proven he/she correct, and I agree with them. 
Though I do see the value of a network where every participant takes part in enforcing the rules. 
I simply don’t think it is necessary for this network. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:33:50
I think that by the time 15 TB of storage a year is necessary to store the Bitcoin blockchain, there is a very good chance that 15 TB of storage would cost about as much as merchants currently spend on rolls of paper for receipts. 
But who am I talking to? You clearly aren't here for any sort of technical discussion, just to insult the intelligence of anyone you think may disagree with you.  
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:56:18
Please research how the bitcoin protocol works and come back. Regurgitating what another redditor posted does not count. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:02:44
But that is the whole point of the Blockchain... a permanent immutable ledger of all transactions. That is most definitely a selling point to me.
Blockchain is the revolutionary idea behind bitcoin - not simply moving money around online.
It seems tackling the challenges facing on-chain transactions is better than simply moving most of them off chain. 
What good is the blockchain if we don’t even use it most of the time?
