Doesn't really help that it's been *made* in a meme format on Reddit though. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:24:08


That's... Kind of why I said it. 
And I don't belive that kind of saving will cause any incentives to make investments. It would rather decrease demand, raise unemployment and possibly cause bank runs that would further remove capital from any capital pool that could be used for investments. 
But if you honestly think deflation would make for a healthy economy, I have zero interest in having any form of discussion with you.
You gotta remember that the value of each coin would be higher for each person born, and since we have a positive birth rate in the world, the currency would just continue to deflate regardless of how much activity outside basic necessities there is.

Aw fuck, I missed it. :(
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:30:28
It's formatted improperly, and it's still poorly worded as "better use a whatever" is generally not used in the same way as "It's better to use a whatever".
So it would still catch a lot of heat.
And if it was to be used correctly it should read 




And with the picture being the whole meme, and the writing on the top and bottom of the picture, with white text with black outlining.
So if you think it's correctly made, you just don't know how to make this meme.
And ofcourse "speculating in volatile currencies isn't investing" seeing as this is in a cryptocurrency sub.

No. I'm not clicking some random scetchy PDF link you provide.
You're actually being nothing but condecending and talk as if you view me as stupid, or atleast view yourself as more intelligent by a long shot. 
But I can't really see that you've provided any real arguments as to why your claims, that go against the current accepted and tought economic theories, are correct. You're just making claims and saying those who disagree are under misconceptions and have incorrect views.
I've actually studied economics at university, and your agruments are of no substance. Call it a cop-out or whatever you want, I wasn't looking for an argument, just to remind people that deflation generally causes stagnation in the ecomomy and bad times.
And why would I argue with someone who goes against the accepted theories, without making any arguments for why his claims are correct. There's just no point in arguing with you, it's just a waste of time.

You can retain wealth in many other ways than holding pure cash.
It's pretty widely known in economics that a healthy economy needs low inflation, but still inflation.
If there needs to be a change, it's the populations education on economics and how to generate or create wealth over time. Not an instrument to disrupt and stagnate economies.
I'm all for cryptocurrency as a *currency*, but not as long time investment that's only holding value just because we want it too.
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:18:55

People can live in houses. Or get a second one to rent out so other people have somewhere to live.
And when the market is saturated and the prices too high, they can look to other investments that generate wealth and something people need.
If the common currency is subject to deflation, people will have less reason to invest in any market, as keeping cash would be just as good or better.
There are more markets than the housing market, and it can be flooded by building more houses in combination with better and faster transportation.

Your argument up to now has had nothing with creating stable money to do, just gathering your own wealth through a deflating asset you call a curreny, that somebody other than you made and controls. Make your own money then, see how valuable it is.
The govnerments could still just buy up a majority of the cryptocurrency to control it.
You're making very bad arguments and assumptions here. It sounds too me like you're the one who doesn't know as much as you think. But also like there's no point in talking too you at all, either.

You forgot to read the part where I mentioned the market was saturated and prices too high, and people would look to other places that gave better returns while creating somewhere. One of those things could be building new houses to lower the prices of existing housing.
Bitcoin isn't storing wealth with a low but stable rate of return. It's volitile as fuck, and people get burned all the time.
If you want somewhere to store wealth with a low but stable rate of return, buy bonds. It's what they're designed for. And the people issuing the bonds can use them to create constuctive wealth, that could have a positive impact on the world.

So That's a business opputunity, unless buying and selling cryptocurrency between private people or local businesses is illegal.

Well, you could open accounts in banks in other countries that don't block them. Send your money there first.

It seems pretty simple to get them then, I just need to empty my wallet before recovering it as BCH, and currently I'm hoping the "repair wallet" will sync the transactions correctly, so I'll be able to transfer the funds that's seen as unconfirmed by the wallet, but the TX is confirmed by 50k+.

For housing. Rent and invest a set amount in something you belive in elsewhere, then buy a house when you can afford it yourself.
Or atleast when you have enough wealth to pay off your mortgage in one go if you have to.

You would design the system in such a way that it could be confiscated. So that the lender or a third party would hold the BTC, like a bank.
If you're gonna lend money with a BTC as collateral, you wouldn't be allowed to sell the BTC after you got the loan, so why would they let you have free reign over the BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:15:13
Yes, but he says not to invest in something you don't understand.
And he says he doesn't understand it, so it's very understandable to for him to not jump into that speculation.
I think he also sees it somewhat like gold, and he doesn't wanna invest in gold either. He wants farms, and other assets that produce goods and services.
But from what I've heard, Goldman Sachs might be stocking up on some Bitcoins, and he owns part of them and some other investment banks, so there is probably some of his assets that has some Bitcoin holdings.

@_date: 2019-08-12 14:25:15
I just had a thought.
What if you could spend some of the value of your Bitcoin without actually selling your Bitcoin.
Just like when you own a house, if you own it straight up, you can mortgage it and spend the money you get out elsewhere.
Now it certainly wouldn't get you 85% value, but perhaps 85% of whats been "proven" to be the "long term" support for the current cycle.
So like right now, you'd be able to pull out 85% of $3,000 per BTC.
So every BTC could be "mortgaged" at $2,550.
And then there could be different intrest rates for different "bottoms".
This would make it more like a store of value than a currency, though.
Just a thought.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:29:50
Haha, sounds like one of the guys who think a deflation based currency is gonna fix everything, and rich people won't be able to fuck you over hard with a hard cap on the money supply. ��

Inflation has always been a thing, now we're just trying to plan it by an elected governing body.
By removing planned inflation you're opening up the non-rich to be subject to wealthy people inflating and deflating the value of currency as part of their constant speculation to build more wealth.
The consensus is that around 2-3% is acceptable inflation, as any lower can easily spiral into deflation.

You sound too stupid to even understand what I'm saying.
I never talked about checks, that's you.
Money is an IOU from the government, issued by the central bank, to avoid the need for barter trade.
I'm not interjecting anything. I'm saying the same I did from the start.
I never said the US doesn't use checks. I said I wasn't from the US, how stupid do you have to be to not understand that from what I said?
I was talking about money bills, so yes, they fit the definition.
But you're the one claiming larger checks arn't liquid because you're subject to waiting a few days for them. That's an argument you dragged in for no reason whatsoever.
And I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about Starbucks reciepts for, that's just a proof of money you've already spent.

Hmm, interesting.
It sounds like it might provide some high intrest rates and short loan terms, though.
I was thinking about intrest rates and length of the loans to be around the same as with housing. 
(Like 10-30 years and 3-4% APR, though 10-30 years might be a little too long for the time BTC has existed, atleast up to around 5 years, but that one page you provided seemed to give 12 month loans.)
Like you can usually find a way to get some loans with collateral, it's just a question of what the intrest rates will be, and how long you're allowed to keep the loan.
@_date: 2018-06-08 20:23:12
Or IOUs. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:17:35
Ofcourse, you're promoting gold. But when it suits you it doesn't count because you feel like you can claim it wasn't real gold.
You're just proving that there's litterally zero value in having a discussion with you, ever.
I don't live in Venezuela. The majority of the world doesn't. Why is that even an argument? 
What about that guy who died in a car crash earlier today? We shouldn't have cars!
And are you assuming private bankers are printing money to line their own pockets? It's the governments responability and interest to keep the currency viable and worth a damn. And if you belive they print money for private profits, it's not the system that's the issue, but the corrupt politicians you've elected.
I don't agree with saving in fiat. That's the whole reason a low inflation system is prefered, so you will save in assets and release your cash into the economy instead of hoarding it.
Nor is my country known for printing money to bail out banks.
You're talking about other countries like Venezuela, yet you don't seem to factor in that not everyone lives in the USA.
Elites always profit. So the system needs to be designed to not interfere too much or negative with the general population. And deflation and hard caps will only make it harder to stabilize the economy for the population.
I don't have an agenda to shill anyone into anything, unlike you.
I don't doubt Bitcoin has a place in the financial market, but it is not the place you're shilling. Just like I don't mind people having access to gold, but setting it as the currency is not a good thing.

So why use a check instead of a wire transfer.
I'm sorry for not living in country that still uses checks, maybe you should learn that not everyone lives in the USA dimwit.
I didn't mean anything. I assumed *you* ment inflation, since I have never been presented with a check in my life, so apperantly you ment something entirely different than what I ment, that is completely irrelevant to what I said.

Yes, cash is a liquid asset. And is backed by the government and what it can be used for. Which makes it also an IOU from the government.
It sounds like you are the one who didn't read the definition of what a liquid asset is.












So no, cash and small checks are not the only liquid assets.
I know wire transfers are money transfers.
But cash is usually cash on hand, so a paper bill in your hand, while you're mainly talking about money in the bank.

I didn't say it wasn't liquid because of inflation. I said it was stupid to withdraw 40k cash in most scenarios.
Also, why would it be much different than withdrawing 40k cash from your bank account? I've never had any reason to use checks, and you're the one who brought it up. Even though it's not at all what I ment or said.

Okay, say that you can buy 10 mining rigs for $5k each, so $50k.
Say that with this you could recoup your investment in say 6 months (that was infact possible when I started getting into mining)
So in a business where you know it's gonna have its ups and downs after looking at 2014, you feel like you could expect anywhere between $50k-100k back during the first year. So $0-50k profit the first year, and maybe it'll continue next year, or it wont. But after a rig has been recouped, everything you make above lease and electricity is a profit.
Now say you'd sell the rigs as lifetime contracts for $75k + elecricity&amp;maintenence instead.
Now you get $75k right away, and you can buy another 15 rigs right away, that you can again sell for $122.5k. 
Buy another 24 rigs (and have $2.5k left over) to sell for $180k.
Buy another 36 rigs to sell for $270k.
Buy another 54 rigs to sell for $405k.
Buy another 81 rigs to sell for $607.5k. (+ you've still got an extra $2.5k)
Buy another 122 rigs to sell for $915k.
Buy another 183 rigs to sell for $1,372.5k.
Buy another 274 rigs to sell for $2.055k. (+$2.5k in the bank)
Buy another 411 rigs to sell for $3,082.5k.
Now you're at 1,210 rigs, and maybe you've run out of space(or can't find more locations), or you're just happy with your $3mill. 
Maybe you've managed to do this in 3-6 months instead of the full year it would take you to recoup and potentially make up to $50k on your 10 initial machines.
Even if mining stayed stable and profitable, it would be better to sell the mining as a service where you include the handling of purchasing, building and managing the rigs.
Don't go gold mining, sell picks and shovles. Buy and rent out land.

I didn't say that. I just said that current fiat will be replaced with a govnerment created cryptocurrency if there is widespread adaption.

So you're saying he's a socialist, and he's saying he's a socialist. Because you're both saying he's a democratic socialist. And I'm gonna say that's still too far to the left.
I'm presenting social democratic practices and values, not democratic socialism practices.
There's some big differences in there.
Social democracy, as we have in Norway and most of the Nordic, is fundamentally capitalist.
Democratic socialism is part of socialism, which makes it different from what we have, and what I presented. And what Bernie stands for if he is *actually* a democratic socialist.
And if he is a social democrat, and mislabels himself as democratic socialist, he's not got a good enough grasp on what he's doing to be fit for office.
I don't doubt his heart is in the right place, but he's either too far left or mislabeled. And both of those are bad if you ask me.

Yeah, they probably buy rigs before they get the contracts sold, so they always have a surplus to offer for sale. And it's not like they shut them off when the contract is done.
Now what they're doing here, making you pay $7000 for a $3000 device(that you don't even own), and asking you to pay what seems to be essentially $3.78 per day in maintenence fees, which could be not including electricity(since it was apperantly negative when not charging the fee aswell), on a contract that seems to profit about $1.5 per day over electricity. Then terminating the contract and keeping the device... That's bullshit.
Like he's not allowed to pay for the electricity+fee himself to keep it running so he can get the coins, and if it turns unprofitable he's left without any hardware, so he can't just leave it off untill it might be profitable to use it again, or mine at home without the extremely high fees.
This is just setting people up for failure, while keeping the hardware.
Don't buy the contract, buy the hardware and rent space for mining instead.
(But don't start mining now anyways, maybe next year or the year after. We'll see if it happens again, but regardless it's probably gonna be with newer hardware)

Instead of trying to constantly reduce the consumption, and with that the demand for resources. It's probably better to determine what a sustainable extraction of renewable resources is. Then focus on making the most out of those resources, lowering the resource cost of each unit produced, and creating a limited quota per year of renewable resources.
Now you'll have the fluctuating demand creating an equlibrium price around a "fixed" resource supply that's calculated each year depending on the current renewal rate of the resources.
Then work towards faster space travel, so in the long term we can terraform goldilock planets and expand the area of resource growth exponentially.
@_date: 2018-11-09 00:26:16
Yeah. But it's pretty much the same as I initially said, just with an added spoon.
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:18:44
Inflation is about the *available* supply of currency, and the populations demand for it. 
With population growth you can have an equaly increased money supply without causing inflation, as the new people make a new demand for currency that the new currency fills.
You can have inflation if you have the same money supply, but you have negative population growth, since now the deceased peoples money will be spread around less people. 
This is why the govnerments "print money", if the economy has a higher demand for currency they add new money to the economy, if the economys demand for currency is lowered, they remove money from the economy, often by selling bonds.
Bitcoin won't cause just disinflation, it will cause deflation due to it's limited and "decreasing" amount of coins. And if everyone in the world gets behind BTC, it'll cause massive deflation untill everyone has adapted and population growth stagnates.
Sure 1 BTC will always be worth 1 BTC, but for every new person born, there will be less BTC per person.
Deflation will expose you to a higher risk of the economy stagnating due to the increased pay-off by hoarding your currency. The entire economy could collapse, since it's more profitable to *not* invest in production of goods and services.
You need a steady, low(2-3%) and predictable inflation rate to maintain a healthy economy with incentives to invest in progression.
Currency is supposed to be just that, currency; a means to trade goods and services, not an investment object.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:23:14
When the price goes far enough down big time speculants, that may or may not have been part of those selling around ATH, will start buying back larger positions again.
This will essentially limit the supply, and if the demand is falling slower than the supply, consistent or increasing, the price will go up again.

That's not the consumption, that's the recommended PSU for the whole system. And it will not pull 100% from the PSU either, as that will lead to a very inefficient power draw.
Here's some power consumption from 3dgurus 780 review.
Most configurations above 250w here is 2+ GPUs.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:14:07
Sure, but his example is either wrong, or based on a 2x top tier GPUs(1080ti) gaming computer with both cards drawing close to the maximum by increasing power draw when overclocking.
So if the computer in question has only one GTX 1070(and this is very normal for your upper mid-range gaming PC), he'd be looking at around 1/4th the power draw.

Is it that the stock configurations often allow the FE cards to sit at 82C, or that they're reaching far beyond that and dying in a mining configuration where the miner hasn't lowered the power target, set a higher fan speed on the card, aswell as not having enough fans on each rig to move the heat away from the cards faster than letting it rise on it's own, or only be affected by a general negative airpressure?

It's not a scam, and you're gonna have fluctuating demand from abroad as a large currency, even if it's not the world reserve.
There needs to be a body that determines how much can be printed based on the inflation you're up against.
If you've had too much inflation last year, print less this year. And the other way around.

We don't have the same insurances baked into the mortgage, then. So your example doesn't apply here.
You didn't cite anything earlier, you just said stuff.
And I'm not about to read an entire research paper, nor in the mood for tedious economics equations.
You're also refering to a study that promotes zero-inflation, which is not necessarily the same as long term deflation. While you have been promoting deflation.
I asked for evidence for why wages wouldn't drop during deflation, that's what you opposed.
And still, while zero inflation doesn't have to incentivise saving in the same way deflation does, it still doesn't incentivise investing, which will certainly slow economic growth, as you're only looking at opportunity cost from time, and not a constant devaluation of your cash.
And I have no idea how you're trying to claim Bitcoin to be zero inflation. Even if that's the target, it won't happen.
There is a set amount of coins available, and those can be lost by people losing access to them. Population is not set at a fixed rate of people, so even when you have a maximum amount of coins, *and even if you couldn't lose any*, you would still be subject to deflation due to population growth, and inflation if we end up with negative birth rates.
So your zero inflation dream will still need someone to put money into, and pull money out off the economy to keep it steady enough.
And that's gonna be really hard, most likely near impossible.
(And if we can regain access to the lost coins, that just means the algorithm is broken and the coins are worthless)

Yeah, I know it's the interest payments. I'm just saying we have lower interest rates.
If productivity increases, you might end up with less need for employees, so they'll compete for jobs by offering to work for less, or you will have real-wage unemployment(when wages are above the equilibrium, and workers wont accept lower salaries). Deflation causes lower wages or higher unemployment wether you like it or not. 
With deflation you have interest baked into the currency.
If you have 2% inflation and 4,5% interest, your real-interest adjusted for inflation is 2,5%.
If you have 2% deflation and 0,5% interest, your real-interest adjusted for deflation is still 2,5%.
And the banks will probably still ask for more than 0,5%, while advertising it as lower interest rates, directed at the uneducated. And as a result making more money, while you'll pay more.

That part about paying double for your house on a 30 year mortage sounds like some American thing I'm too Norwegian to understand.
(Or maybe too young, as I belive my parents had higher interest rates, but also cheaper homes)
But yeah, if you wanna loan money, that costs money, why else would someone let you use their money?
And low deflation will still result in an incentive to save, prices will drop, and wages will drop as a result of lower cost of living and profit opportunities, increased unemployment and an economy with lower incentives to invest.
So you might still just end up paying just the same, since you'll be earning less for your hour of labor. If anything at all.
Hell, you might end up paying more even, since the money you have to repay ends up being worth more for every year that passes by. And that's an interest rate you can't negotioate with the bank.
The keyword is real wage, your wage adjusted for inflation (or deflation if that happens).
A better solution is probably better financial education througout school. And not having stagnant wages. 
Have some laws that make inflation increase to wages automatic, or atleast make it harder for larger corporations to fend off unions.
Workers usually need unions.

I doubt you'd like a stagnated economy if you had one, but whatever.
And you guys are the ones who choose those politicians, so maybe you should work on getting better politicians instead. Whom can then get better bankers.
The founding fathers can be wrong you know. Even with gold and silver as money, you can still experience inflation.
It was actually done in 1324 by one of the wealthiest kings, on one of his travels he'd cause inflation of gold in the places he visited, due to his generousity.

Also during low inflation, those who want to save usually do so in banks with saving accounts that generally matches inflation, which makes the money availible for the banks to lend out with real estate or investment grade assets as collateral.

It seems to be around 2,8-3% for the better rates now. And it was closer to 2,5% earlier this year, as we just had another 0,25% hike in the key rate.
Deflation isn't anything new. I doubt Japan wanted to get out of deflation if it was such a good thing.
If productivity increases more than the economy grows, you'll end up with either lower wages or higher unemployment. Which will most likely be the case with deflation.
You'll still have those. And you don't need bonds to get the same interests you'd get from a savings account, so that's on you for not choosing the right bank for your 1-2%.

Yeah, but you also have population growth.
You can end up with deflation if the increase in money supply is lower than the population increase.
You end up with inflation if the increase in money supply exceeds the population growth rate.
Then you also have to factor in a lot of other things that will affect the demand of a currency.
Take the USD, it's the world reserve currency, and will have demand from other individuals and entire nations outside of the USA.
I'm pretty sure Zimbabwe has disbanded it's own currency and is using the USD, Euro and some others.
So money supply alone is not an indication of rapid inflation, just scare tactics to use on people uneducated in economics.
(Also, you should remember that Reddit isn't a USA only site, so it's better to specify that you're talking about the USA, instead of just using "we")

No, it's the advertised rates. You can probably get better if you've got good credit. And credit score isn't as incorperated in peoples minds here. Those rates are also advertised towards young people, so people who generally don't have been old enough to build much credit history.
I also have no idea how you're getting to that number, as I'm getting a 2Mill NOK loan to equate to 1,035,549 in interests with 3%. Which is half of what you're suggesting.
Well, Japan isn't the only country to ever experienve deflation either. Maybe you should explain why USA didn't keep it's deflation the times they've had deflation. Same with Hong Kong and The UK.


You can just take your pick of sources when searching for deflation and lower wages.
But maybe you should provide some evidence of why it's not a bad thing, and why wages will remain the same, while you're sitting there and advocating that some of the most recognized economical theories are wrong.
I have no interests in bonds untill I can issue my own and be the borrower instead. I'll hold my money in a stock fund over bonds any day.
Anyways, from Bloomberg is seems like it's 1,5-2% for US bonds, which makes a net loss with the 2018 inflation of 2,44%.
If you're not putting them in a bank with 2-2,5% instead, that's on you.

Yeah, but running the car at full throttle wouldn't be a good analogy either. 
If the GPU/ASIC is properly cooled and with the right voltage(or undervoltaged) it won't have the same degrading effect as running the engine at full throttle.
Maybe using a lightbulb that's left on 24/7 is a better anology, as those also mostly degrade during their shift in power on/off cycles.

Yeah, don't bet on a reversal. Wait for confirmation and buy above the bottom.
And don't go all in, you're just exposing yourself to lose everything in one trade.
And if you wanna be a bit more advanced, short it with margin trading untill you hit the confirmed reversal. 
(Don't risk more than 1-3% of your capital per trade, though)

And when the price goes up, it gets more attention. So more people enter the market and the demand increases, and the price increases even more because of FOMO.

Bitcoin is designed to be volatile untill it reaches some sort of equilibrium on the demand side.
Since the supply is pretty much constant-&gt;decreasing, a governing body can't really stabalize the currency with changes in the supply, unless they make themselves the largest whale. 
And currently the whales are people who wanna profit, instead of providing stability and a viable currency.
And since there is a limit to how many coins can be mined in total, it *will* deflate at some point again, even if you manage to stabalize it. Unless people lose confidence in the currency or you get a negative birth rate.

The way I read it, it's an extra fee if you deposit less than $1,000. 
And I don't see anything but $20 worth minimum for crypto withdrawal. (So you'll have to show me where it says 10k for that. 
Now, you need to have had $10,000 in the account a one point to be allowed access to the platform, but after you've had 10k there once, you don't need to keep it there.
