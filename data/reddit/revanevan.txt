Didn’t even notice that, some how ��
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:20:54
Awesome, thanks so much!
@_date: 2019-03-16 01:40:40
It’s over 1000 now! ��
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:50:14
Once the price of bitcoin goes up, 30,000 of satoshis should turn into 3,000, then 300 etc so maybe in the future it won’t be as big of a deal. Plus there are countries that use bigger numbers like that (Japanese yen) 
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:21:31
Damn didn’t know that. Appreciate the info
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:58:52
Congrats man keep it coming!
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:26:37
Cheers to that 
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:26:18
So you’re all in, right? ��
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:08:13
Over 22k.. up 1k in 2 minutes lol
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:27:49
This is what I like to see
@_date: 2019-03-28 22:28:06
The Square Cash App if you’re in the United States. Easy interface pretty self explanatory. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:02:01
So you think the halving has this much power in the market? If this is the case wouldn’t the market be super easy to predict?
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:20:33
Very good point I like your approach.
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:47:39
Sure is! He’s actually really intelligent and the show has some good humor in it.
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:14:28
Cheers to that
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:41:01
Good point on the self-fulfilling prophecy idea. I started accumulating right before the plunge below 6k. I’m hoping my timing turns out just as good as yours ��
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:15:12
Edited ����
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:06:15
How did the cost of mining double the price?
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:15:06
Better than 95% of people our age lol
@_date: 2019-03-19 23:55:02
So there was a lot of positivity in the space at that time?
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:36:23
If you just want bitcoin download the cash app and use it. It’s super simple and it’s instant.

Haven’t seen banking on bitcoin I’ll watch that one today!
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:30:42
This happens in 24 hours in crypto..
@_date: 2019-03-06 01:29:53
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:59:28
Totally agree!
@_date: 2019-03-31 01:06:25
Bullish in the very short term but we will definitely pull back and retest some lows. It’s not going to just break past 6k and then on we go to the bull market. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:24:12
Ah, thank you for clarification. Or miners could sell to try and stay a float and flood the market, right? 
@_date: 2019-03-16 02:06:35
This is amazing I need this llama 
@_date: 2019-03-19 09:30:25
So when you get paid do you immediately turn it into bitcoin or do you have a system where it’s automatically converted? This is super appealing to me.
@_date: 2019-03-22 23:18:58
Very true. I can’t forget there’s an argument for both sides of human psychology ��
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:26:27
Love the signature! They need to do a better job at promoting this because every person I mention it to are oblivious. I save 10% on my gas/groceries and buy bitcoin every week ��������
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:37:13
I’m torn. I’m getting impatient but I also want to keep accumulating ��
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:34:08
My god. Best pron there is
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:42:25
Man I hope so. I hope it’s legitimized enough by then that people see it as an alternative hedge to a falling stock market. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:18:42
I actually plan on doing that my self. The cash app makes it super easy to buy &amp; sell bitcoin, I can get my paychecks directly deposited there and I have a debit card with them. I’m hoping they go internationally eventually so you’ll have that opportunity as well. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:44:45
I agree, I think the whole decimal thing really turns people off. Hopefully satoshis will catch on
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:30:02
It was the end of the Bear market 
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:56:16
What’s the difference between segwit (P2SH) and HD segwit (BIP49 P2SH)? These are the two wallet options for BlueWallet. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:20:11
What’s a better exchange that uses USD? Im currently holding fiat in the Coinbase wallet (I figured it’s safer than being on the exchange) for when I want to buy dips in price. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 11:43:32
I’ve sent bitcoin to my segwit address from binance. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:51:23
Point is businesses shouldn’t have to worry about whether the money they are receiving is fake or not. The fact that fiat has this problem is another reason why bitcoin is superior. That’s all!
@_date: 2019-02-24 22:43:05
Not fond of the winklevoss twins lol
@_date: 2019-02-24 00:40:39
Definitely only the $1 one �� still waiting for the $10!
@_date: 2019-02-23 13:00:32
You know, I thought about that but it doesn’t really matter to me. I just wanted a reason to play around with lightning and if I ended up helping a kid with his little home business AND with a cool drawing at the end of it, that’s just icing on the cake! Plus now the Bitcoin Bear has been born 
@_date: 2019-02-23 13:39:35
A cute bear is a cute bear indeed! We’ll probably never know ����
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:40:32
Yes, I was referring to a p2sh segwit address so you could be right. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:34:46
So that’s why my fee was like 200k satoshis ��
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:17:49
I’m afraid of this happening to me. I’m sorry you’ve had to go through all that I know it’s a big fucking headache. If I knew of a better way to hold a significant amount of fiat either on a wallet or exchange I wouldn’t be using Coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:07:54
What did you order??
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:39:35
I have used cash app a little for smaller purchases, but you’re right about the extra 1.5% or so for each buy. And with the amount of money I’m putting into it that 1.5% adds up, which is why I’m stuck using Coinbase pro. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 01:54:05
Proof a kid drew it 
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:26:31
Even more bullish now great post!
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:13:28
Well said.
