Markets are far more diverse and complex than we are capable of understanding. We always seek answers to understand and to feel in control. When things are really complex and requires a lot of effort it’s much more comfortable to resolve to simple explanations. 
Concerning BCH: Single actors can play a role (tribalism), but with over 1,4 billion USD in daily volume whales alone can’t control the market, especially when BCH is traded at 150+ exchanges according to coinmarketcap.
From what I have read Roger sold the majority of his BTC before it hit 10k. So if he don’t own as much BTC anymore he would have to short it, which he at some point would have to fill (which isolated would reverse the price). And trying to move the BTC market is much, MUCH harder since the daily volume is over 10-15 billion USD and it’s traded at over 400 exchanges. In this sense whales becomes ants. 
I think the FUD in the Asia market is a much bigger factor. A lot of Asia investors (China, South Korea, Japan etc) are obviously worried and uncertain about government crackdown and regulations.

How would you describe someone who studied and worked within the field of economics for 12 years, that favors the Austrian school of thought? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:18:25
Yeah, I completely agree with this.
However, I would argue, at least in my experience, that no matter what you study or which side your on, there will always have to be subjective theory’s and conclusions. 
I think most academics and professionals are highly underestimating their own biases and ability to be objective (including my self) when conducting work, studies and so on. 
I became an Austrian simply because I think the world is to complex and because we are largely driven by human instincts. I think the state in large is a result of tradition, tribalism, urge for power and market failures throughout history. 
To me it just seemed weird that a few people in a room could know how to set interest rates for the world.

I’m an austrian economist and I got rekt in the comment section for stating that I don’t think the quantitative easing and money printing can solve our problems, but rather create more long term problems.

For Bitcoin yes, but the other side of the exchange is fiat, which does not hold the same properties. The main problem when exchanging bitcoin for fiat is the risk of man in the middle attacks (MIM).

Great answer.   
I think Bisq have a chosen a good way to handle it. You can't completely eliminate social manipulation and mim's unless both sides of the transaction is known, but I would imagine Bisq get rid of a lot of scammers due to it's low limits, compared to ex. LocalBitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:21
Thanks for the insights. 
I see the benefits of PoS vs PoW, but what about security? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:32:20
If the participants of the trade know each other or have the tools to identity each other, that's great. Then you can eliminate most of the frauds and man-in-the-middle attacks. Comes with some cost, but it's definitely a valuable for those that need and value privacy on a more broader level. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 17:15:27
As much as I respect the right to privacy it's hard to create a marketplace with substantial volume if one or both  parties remain anonymous during an exchange, because it increases the risk of fraud.

Yes, sure. Bob have an ad where he offer to sell 1 BTC for 10.000 USD.   
Alice contacts Bob to buy 1 BTC for 10.000 USD with bank transfer.   
She shows him ID and transfers the 10.000 USD to Bob as promised.  
Bob receives the money and releases BTC to Alice.    
Some days later, Bob's account is frozen and the transfer is called back. Turns out the Alice did not buy 10.000 USD of Bitcoin. She thought she was buying a car or whatever from John's ad on Craig's list. John, however, was just playing them both and now got away with the BTC. He was just creating a fake ad on Craig's list so he could open a buy order with Bob.   
MIM scams are very common because it's easy to execute and easy to get away. As a responsible trader, there are things you can do to minimize the risk, such as waiting to confirm the details, checking FB, phone etc. My point is essentially this: **dont trust, verify.**

Do you think we should change PoW to PoS?   
I think the cost with PoW are overstated because they're easy to observe, while the benefits are understated (as of now) since so few people understand Bitcoin. And, I believe that PoW is the most fair system since it rewards work and not titles or positions.

Banks will adopt and they will become nodes on the network. I expect growing regulatory requirements and scrutiny towards nodes holding funds for other parties. Enforcing it is another story.

Thank God Roubini is the “opponent” to crypto. His hostile attitude make people curious. What is this bitcoin thing that makes this man so angry???

Thanks. Yes, you can cancel the order. All the funds are just locked in escrow.   
Concerning frauds etc: With these types decentralized platforms, there's always going to be a certain percentage of people using it for criminal activities. I've used it plenty of times and never experienced it, but I take my precautions, such as not getting to greedy on the discount (which will increase the chances of fraud) and using sellers with a good reputation.

Thanks you for this! I felt I learned something here. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong: If you isolate the effect of Segwit and Bech32 (which I dont know much about), you could fit about eight times as many transactions in BTC than in BCH (if BCH had 1 mb blocks)? [Segwit full potential 4x + Bech32 2x?]. But if BCH have 32 mb blocks, it would still have 32/8 = 4 times the transaction capacity. 
Higher transaction supply should result in a lower minimum sat/byte fee required to included in the next block for BCH than BTC then? At least if we are taking onchain, or I'm I missing something? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 15:48:34
I see a lot of people mentioning RBF as a reason, but from my understanding (correct me if I'm wrong here), RBF only affect transactions with 0 confirmations. I dont understand why that would affect the number of confirmations required. Why not 1 for both? 
One BTC transaction with one confirmation should in theory be safer than one BCH transaction, since it has more Proof of Work. In any case, it should be the other way around. That's my line of thought, but Binance knows what their doing, so I suspect I'm missing something from the equation here.

One day you wake up to the news that the US government in coordination with other governments have banned Bitcoin. In such scenario all companies buying, selling, using and holding bitcoins would have to seeze their operation effective immediately. Companies not complying with the order would face criminal charges, so unless the company owners are willing to risk prison time, they will comply. So companies such as Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Shapeshift, Bitpay, Kraken, Poloniex, Bitmex, Localbitcoins, Paxful and many more would take down their site and you would not be able to log in or access your holdings.
Miners operating as companies would also have to shut down, which would lead to a big drop in hashrate and this would make transactions on the legacy network really slow and expensive until the difficulty adjust. Most people would panic sell their bitcoins on the exchanges that was still operating illigally. The price would collapse.
So not great news. But, the technology is still there, and as long as someone is mining you would be able to send and receive bitcoins. But a ban would wreck the ecosystem and the easy ways of using it.

Yes. The monetary inflation equals the expansion of credit and base currency. Since the financial crisis central banks really hit the gas on that. Both expanding the base currency and lowering interest rates to increase credit. I don't have any percentage to give you for the US market, but here in Norway the credit expansion was 7 % last year. I would imagine it's higher in the US since the FED have the privilege of being the lender of last resort.

I would respectfully disagree with that statement. In his [opening post]( Satoshi wrote about the downside of the current system making microtransactions impractical. With Bitcoin he proposed a better solution.
It becomes pretty clear that Satoshi intended for tons of transactions onchain. [Satoshi wrote this]( 






That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

You are right that email spam have a cost associated with it, but those cost are incredible small compared to what you would have to pay if it was on the blockchain. 
You can't *eliminate* spam, but you *limit* spam by associating a cost to every transaction, making spam less economically viable because it relies on scale. 
There are no perfect system that can separate the good from the bad. It can only *encourage* the good and *limit* the bad.

I keep asking myself that exact question. Why would arguably the worst public persona of all time, Craig *"I got more money than you country"* Wright, keep at it? I just don't get it. Why risk going to court, in several cases (some for libel, the bitcoin cash split suitcase, the kleiman suitcase) if you're just a fraud? Makes no sense to me.   
And if nobody listened to him, why does Bitcoin SV have a market cap of over 1 billion dollars?

That is up to you to decide when we launch.   
We're very focused on user experience and are fortunate to have a highly skilled front end developer who normally works on designing financial services for online banks. We want to streamline the trade and payment process, increase the profit motive of advertisers and give them the tools they need to build a market in a compliant way.

While I praise that Bitcoin will become the monetary system of the future, dont jump to soon in hopes of the collapse of the central banks. This is not one of those "oh, yeah, by the way, did you read the news yesterday about the central bank collapsing?". 
If (when) the central banks collapse, government follows. Forget your pension, your savings, your job, your healthcare benefits and forget pricing Bitcoin in dollars. Just imagine a day waking up and you couldn't make a bank transfer because all the big banks went bankrupt (and all your deposits with it). Just imagine going to work and your boss says your all fired, because he went bankrupt. It would be a total disaster, and it would lead to massive social unrest. 
The sad part is, in reality, all the buildings, all the infrastructure and the incredible people would still be the same. It's just the numbers on a screen going nuts and people not knowing who the hell owns what.   
The best case scenario would be that the fiat system lives on for as long as it can, while the Bitcoin ecosystem grows and people get educated using the new system. 
Remember that you have a role to play. To educate, use and learn others about it. To tell your friends, your family and coworkers of what to come. The fact that you are here makes you very important in preventing "who knows what of bad consequences" when the shit hits the fans. Populism is on the rise, and I'll quote billionaire Ray Dailo: "This looks pretty much like the same situation like 1937".

This is a ticking bomb, and something that really worries me. I think most people in general are underestimating the long term consequences of to much debt. Just read some economic history and look what to much debt historically have lead to. 
When the next global debt crisis hits (and I think it will be worse than 2008), the economy needs to deleverage. 
One have to understand the following:
Money = debt
Deleveraging = destruction of debt = destruction of money. 
All prices will fall like crazy, including cryptocurrencies! The difference will lie in the percentage. 
Companies will go bankrupt, people lose their houses, their jobs and it will rip families apart. 
But this is nothing compared to the big ones: the federal and local governments. They have accumulated such a massive amount of debt. Taxpayers (meaning all of us) are going to pay the price, there is no escape.
Governments will default loans, pension obligations, health care benefits, introduce new taxes, sell assets and centralize even further. 
Central bankers face the following choice: Let the economy crash, or announce QE4^2 that will help cryptocurrencies replace them even faster. I'm betting that when the day comes, they will have no choice, but to let Bitcoin win.
