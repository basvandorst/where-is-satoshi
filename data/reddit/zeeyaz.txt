Went to top left, settings, then selected currency (it was auto selected to USD, changed to something else then went back to USD), still isn't showing a balance. :(

I need it to go down a lil more and to stay this way till the 1st so I can finally buy my first Full Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:27:59
Hopefully it will work itself out soon, just got back into bitcoin again after a year!

Oooh, i never thought of doing this, i should sell mine as well!

I'm getting alot of people telling me it isnt worth it to wait for the long haul, So I might invest a couple coins just to store, and start with trading, as others have suggested.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:34:06
haha, well Good Luck with your sale and thank you for giving me the idea as well!

Thanks for the reply! I haven't researched anything about "Litecoin" yet... will check it out!

I never thought of doing that, I was just exited to get my first whole bitcoin and let it sit in an offline wallet / paper wallet until I was out of college.
Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:34:49
Thanks again, stranger! Will appreciate any help I get!
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:34:06
I'll check em out, thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:21:06
Heading there now, just comparing my hardware to what they recommend.
Thanks again!

Thanks for the advice, I'm just kicking myself as I'm an inexperienced trader and don't know how well bitcoin works yet. I just want to buy something and let it ride until I'm out of college.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:10:19
I definitely have experienced it and hope to learn from this in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:17:19
What does that exactly mean? I'm still new to lingo.

I think 580 is a great investment point for me, as it's 1/3 of the income I bring in a month (VA compensation, G.I. Bill, Job).
I guess I'll wait it out again.

You post this in every thread.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:24:26
I never thought of trading as well, Thank you for the advice! I have plenty of time to learn about it whilst in college, I'll look into it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:03:32
Sounds like a perfect plan, ty.

Yeah I'm thinking about it, I just was taking all these redditors opinions at face value.
