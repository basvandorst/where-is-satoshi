I've always taped over the camera. At least they don't have a visual.

LOL at "sour patch devs." I buy their candy cheap then sell for more BTC when it gets pumped.

Trezor.io addresses this, but I can't access their website from work to copy. From what I read there and elsewhere: If there is a hard fork, you will have Bitcoin and BitcoinUnlimited in equal amounts. However, it's possible that this event will make people wary of either coin going forward. It's possible that an altcoin will emerge as the new standard. I've seen chatter in the Polo trollbox that people plan to sell it all for alts and wait it out. I am not sure what I'll do, probably use them to buy some of the stabler alts as a hedge against a possible crash.

How do you sell BCH on Kraken if they aren't accepting deposits? Did you leave your BTC on they site before the fork? I'm incredibly annoyed about Trezor dropping the ball on this, saying they'd support BCH then realizing its was a bit more complicated than expected. So... I could split my BTC on Trezor and deposit BCH... "somewhere." Not Kraken yet!
Whatever, I'd probably sell too low anyway!

I see it as more like watching the friend's greedy neighbors roasting marshmallows on it. This is all about speculators falling over themselves. And I wonder how many "investors" only just heard about BTC in relation to the Brexit.

I was hoping to split it then leave it on the Trezor then sell a few BCH on... KRAKEN, which is not accepting BCH deposits yet. Not the first time I've been late to a party. Hoping to catch up at some point.

This is not how Internet works! Hysteria and conspiracy theories run the Internet.

Thanks for keeping us informed! And I do appreciate the effort it will take to ensure a safe fork.

I'm still waiting for Trezor to fully support it so I can sell at least some of it. I can't access it at work, have to wait till this evening to see if it's fully functional yet.

Warren Buffet called Bitcoin a "mirage."

And here we all thought that the price was up because of the Yuan devaluation :D
