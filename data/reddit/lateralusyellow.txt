If gold was valued solely on its industrial applications I imagine it would be less than $100 an ounce right now, at most.

They only do that because governments want to move to a purely digital economy and eliminate cash so it's easier to tax everyone out the ass.

I don't think it's unethical nor should it be a crime.
Many scholars at the Mises institute would agree, for example here is an article by Robert Murphy on the subject:

Upon its founding the United States was one of the closest to an anarchist nation the world has ever seen and it turned into the wealthiest nation on earth. I don't think that's a coincidence. For thousands of years human beings have been looking for divine intervention in two places, God and The State, both are equal delusions. People can throw up all the preconceived ideas they want about why historically the U.S. government supposedly had to grow in size and scope, but it doesn't change the fact that those preconceived ideas have never been seriously questioned.

The morality of the average settler and that of the founders was not exactly equal, so that is a completely tangential issue. 
Of the founders who were against slavery but never-the-less owned slaves, what exactly were they supposed to do with them? Send them back to africa? Set them free in a society only to see them quickly re-enslaved by people who would have treated them a lot more like slaves and less like family?
The fact that this is one of the first places you people go whenever you hear economic ideas you don't like says a lot about who you really are. You're simply masking the historical genocidal stench of marxist claims of oppression and the delusional socioeconomic presuppositions that come along with them, under the much more real and legitimate historical plight of blacks.

Not sure if Roger is an ancap, but anarcho-capitalists in general don't think insider trading is a crime nor do they consider intellectual property to be a legitimate form of property.

Yeah that's the popular bet, I've got my money on the opposite being true. I also bet everyone's going to be coming after me and my winnings like zombies when it turns out I'm right.

I'm not really a long time member of this sub, and only recently began to really study cryptocurrencies. So maybe this is a dumb question, but... what if someone or some organization IS supposed to end up in control of Bitcoin? What if this is just the beginning of a major divergence of investment from one cryptocurrency to a whole bunch of currencies? The beginning of a real currency marketplace, a marketplace that knows no borders?
Why are the "users" meant to be in control? I mean sure, they should have some serious influence on the direction of the coin, but what if that influence is supposed to come from their ability to switch to competing coins if they're dissatisfied?
It's the miners &amp; developers that are truly the most invested in Bitcoin after all isn't it? They hold the most illiquid assets don't they?
Is this not the beginning of a free market in currency? The beginning of currencies as a service or product, rather than something monopolized by governments as a means of enslaving their citizens?
@_date: 2017-01-27 04:04:59


begging the question...
I'm not gonna argue about it. Any system funded through taxation can never and has never resulted in a net benefit to the people it was designed to help. More simply, any problem the government has ever "solved" was merely one of it's own prior creation.
Go get it straight from the horses mouth and study some Austrian theory, or don't if you're so sure of yourself.
People like me literally do not care who wins an election, or what the government does, because we know it's a fundamentally immoral institution that's destined to fail in the long run.
You'll never see a well studied libertarian surprised by political events, or the breakout of war, or major financial crises. There can't be any other reason for that other than assuming we must understand [something about the nature of the world]( that everyone else is still blind to.

Well maybe we should abolish the public education system, that way we can stop churning out retards who are then competing for the same jobs as impoverished asian dudes in an ex-communist country.

Agent Smith is, he turns into a virus. The reason there are any Agents at all in the first place is because the machines don't want humans waking up before the earth is ready, and if too many humans wake up the whole system could destabilize. The machines in general are kind of amoral, but they see humans as their mother and will do anything to protect them. The primary purpose of the pods was to keep humans safe from the toxic environment of a post-nuclear war earth, harvesting the energy from the heat of their bodies was just a way to make the process more efficient.

Fun fact: In the Animatrix series, its shown that the machines went to war with humans to save them from destroying themselves. The Matrix was built by the machines as a temporary measure to keep humans alive while the machines were busy healing the earth.

Any sane monkey can hoard cash, it takes intelligence &amp; effort to put it to work. Most people are going to put their savings to work by lending it out, investing it, or starting a business. This is why in a functioning economy the vast majority of wealth is stored in capital assets, which is why in a free banking and currency market inflationary currencies would remain dominant over deflationary ones.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:45:16


Then why don't you see anyone in Italy paying their taxes in Roman Denarius?
I actually am on your side in that I don't believe in commodity backed currencies, but I also don't believe in government-backed ones either.
I personally see Bitcoin as similar to the gold standard in that it has a completely arbitrary and inflexible money supply and thus will never be anything more than a highly liquid commodity, definitely not suitable to act as a major currency in a modern global economy.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:38:47


To be fair the reasons why people assign that value to it are completely different. People assign value to fiat currency because they believe in legitimacy of government and democracy as we know it. With bitcoin people assign value to it because it's a scarce, easily tradeable digital commodity built upon revolutionary cryptographic technology.

Sorry but I'm an Ancap and even I think that book is tinfoil nuttery. No offense to Mr. Griffin though, as he otherwise does some good work speaking about the general philosophical principles the United States was founded on.
 
I think Austrian economists are right about most everything else, but their theory of money and banking is complete nonsense. They have an irrational emotional aversion to inflation of any sort in the same way liberals have a irrational emotional aversion to inequality of any sort.
The vast vast majority of illegitimate inflation is derived from the issuance of government bonds (bonds are just as good as cash because you can use them as collateral for a loan), and the rest (actual "thin-air" money creation) is a drop in the bucket. New money created through fractional reserve banking is perfectly legitimate though, as it is simply the process of leveraging the depositor's funds and splitting the interest earned with the depositors.
In theory from my perspective, a free currency &amp; banking market would settle on dominance of inflationary currencies and fractional reserve banking (fractional reserve banking being the market mechanism which naturally sets the rate of inflation). Business &amp; Home owners will desire inflationary currencies in order to preserve the value of their capital assets, and they have more currency market influence over consumers and people with a demand for idle savings instruments.
I know this puts the fixed money supply model of Bitcoin into question if it ever wants to be useful as a mainstream currency, but IMO that flaw in it's design will relegate it commodity status. Same goes for all alt-coins that follow the fixed money supply model.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:55:19
Well I'll stop you right when you bring gold into it because theoretically with 3rd party auditors paper money could function just fine as it's own asset class in a free banking and currency market, it doesn't need to be backed by a commodity, only a reputable institution (AKA not the government).
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:26:50


What? Your argument doesn't even apply if you're not talking about a fixed money supply.


All people like you can say at the end of the day is that you think inflation of any kind is inherently bad or "unfair", but you never talk about why deflation is supposedly good. It's one or the other. Listen, under a fixed money supply it's the value of your home, business, and investments that gets eroded away. Most people for obvious reasons don't have most of their net worth tied up in fucking CASH of all things, so under a free banking &amp; currency market it stands to reason that inflationary currencies would remain dominant.

The crash in 2008 was mainly the direct result of mortgages for normally unqualified borrowers being guaranteed by the Federal government.
I find people like you seem to want to boil every societal ill down to what we use as money, rather than who's in charge of it (the state).
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:02:22
That's the downside, but there's a much more significant upside.
In any kind of remotely stable economy most people have the majority of their net worth tied up in capital assets, which is why inflationary currencies are better than deflationary ones. Deflation erodes the value of capital assets (homes, businesses, investments, commodities, etc.). 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:49:38
Ok so every mattress stuffing ideologue like you benefits from a deflationary currency while people who are actually running a business or otherwise investing their money get fucked. Nice system you propose there.

The monetary system is not debt-based, our society is debt-based (socialist) and it has nothing to do with the fact that the money we use is made of paper. Even under the gold standard governments borrowed endlessly, so what we use as money is irrelevant. Long before there was paper money, there has always been debt. People borrowed and still had the same leverage on gold for there was more debt owed in gold than there was ever gold.
Too much debt is the problem, not a steady increase in the money supply. It is the politicians and average citizen who supports them who blow it all up, regardless of what you call money.


Fiat means "by decree" (as in the state dictating what money is), not "paper". Paper money != Fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:00:33


This is objectively false.
What world do you live in? Because in my world I'm surrounded by socialists who are to stupid to realize they are demanding the government spend far more money than could ever be taxed. 


[This accounts for &lt; 20% of all purchased debt]( the rest is purchased by private investors. So we'd hardly be in a fiscally sound position regardless.
