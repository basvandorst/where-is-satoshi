This is such a good point. When governments can print as much money as they please to buy btc is not good. My question is how long will they be able to keep that up.

is this real? Are bankers really doing this or is this a publicity stunt put on by btc enthusiasts? 
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:25:17
How likely is this scenario to ever play out for BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:21:36
with no real way to enforce people to hand over their gold.. why the fuck would you actually do it. how did they sell this idea to the average shmoe who owned gold.
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:58:35
Yes, rest assured that only powerful governments will be able to use them.

It's not that difficult. And it will only get easier. Today I paid a bill using the routing and account # from my checking account. It actually was more complicated than sending Bitcoin somewhere. Other than making payments it's pretty simple to have your crypto sitting somewhere safe and if you are worried about it getting lost you could have multiple wallets and backup phrases in safe locations. It's really not rocket science, but for someone who is tottally new, it helps to have someone show you.

What are the other cryptos that don't have ceo's or a handful of people running and calling the shots? I kinda like how btc just is and no one is in charge of it except for the users and miners
@_date: 2018-06-21 23:56:36
Your statement sounds like everything will be okay because only governments will have them. If you ask me.. that is actually a huge problem

Why aren't power companies that say produce electricity from hydroelectric dams not mining bitcoin themselves? I mean if someone is willing to buy electricity from you and then use it to mine bitcoin at a profit.  I don't think it would be that much of a stretch for say a rich and powerful energy company to hedge out some of their money and start building at least 1 mining operation alongside every powerplant they ever build so that when they accidentally produce too much power that the grid cant use they can at the very least turn it into btc. I dunno I am just an average joe here spitballing something that could be pretty, pretty.... prettydumb

I was actually being fecisious. One of the biggest revalations I have had in life is that for the most part no one is smarter than me and no one knows anything. I mean this in the generalist sense.

Right. Logistics I'm sure are daunting, but we are talking about crazy wealthy crazy rich companies. It seems like they could hire the right people to figure it out. I mean you got kids running mining operations out of their basements. These companies are definitely dropping the ball if they aren't in the process or already doing this. They would have to hire an entire new branch or subdivision that just deals with maintaining the mining operations, but they are basically throwing money down the drain if they aren't doing this. For the Uber rich energy companies to say "logistics Mann" when asked why the hell they are missing out on this kind of opportunity is just mind bogglingm. Hire the wffing people you need! You got the money! And I bet any company that started actually publicly saying that they would be doing this their stock would skyrocket. Seems like a no-brainer, but still I'm just some shmoe who probably does not know what he is talking about.

Apparently people who go to those crypto meetups are getting jumped and their crypto forcably stolen. All they need is a couple of beers in you and then you are talking about how much crypto they have. Bullseye is now on your back and they will stalk you, find out where you live and rob you one day as you are going into your front door. And just like that. Your crypto is gone. Even if it's just 1 Bitcoin that's still probably worth the trouble. Think if someone marked what they thought was a �� holding upwards of 50 btc or more. Be careful out there folks.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:14:18
If they are after your crypto they probably don't want to kill you before getting your passwords and private keys.

second layer scaling solutions will solve the transaction "high fee" problem. Good things take time. When it does happen though no one will want to use visa.. or visa will be forced to compete.

Wife and kids held at gunpoint? Also most people will say anything to stop being waterboarded and all you need to do that is a wet towel and a pitcher of water. It's harder to steal Bitcoin or other cryptos but the potential pay off for a the single robbery of a one person is way more than it ever used to be. A successful bank robbery of a million bucks is usually pretty risky and a lot of planning And work goes into a bank robbery I'm sure. You could put in a quarter of as much work and have a fraction of the risk of robbing a bank by going after potential rich btc holders.

Square is just as bad. $45 fee to accept a 1k transaction... that took 2 days to show up in my bank account

Their may still exist some bank like third party that holds and keeps safe your crypto, but I think as crypto develops so will the safegaurds put in place to make it impossible for someone to rob you for your crypto and hopefully it won't involve some middle man it will be because of a feature of your hardware wallet.

A hegemony or new world order would have to happen and then they would have to outlaw and then somehow figure out a way to actually enforce the ban. How exactly could  a hegemony hypothetically enforce a ban and make it to where people wouldn't be able to use crypto currencies?

I think I might get into the stock market. My plan is for it to crash first. This will drive my crypto holdings.. you guessed where. The mutha fuckin moon. And when wall street is freakin out and their is blood in the streets. I will sell some of my crypto profits and buy into the stock market at a ALL TIME LOW. Fool proof. I should right a book.

Get a ledger nano to put your crypto tokens on. It can't be hacked and can only be lost. If you lose/break it, as long as you have the back up pass phrase you can recover your crypto. Basically if you don't like the idea of coinbase keeping your coins safe and potentially making money off of your funds just like a bank makes money of your funds, then you might want to spend $100 and get a cold storage wallet. Also even though coinbase is insured to cover your losses in case of a hack, you can bet your sweet ass it will take, months, maybe years for you to see your money... and you bet your fucking ass it is going to be what it was worth at the time of the hack not what it is worth at the time of you actually getting your money back. Don't be lazy. put your crypto on a ledger. crypto currencies are all about being your own bank and in charge of your own funds. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:32:17
you may be right on this. I guess it would be nicer if it just had a slow decline while the rest went up. People maybe slowly start pulling money out.. but at some point people holding bch will panic sell but by then it wont be correlated i hope and we can all laugh about it.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:25:35
When BCH crashes, it will crash alone and hard. They wont be able to use the LN network on their forked coin and no one is developing a system like it for them either. The only thing keeping them afloat is misinformation and dumb people wanting to own a "whole bitcoin" because btc is "too expensive"
