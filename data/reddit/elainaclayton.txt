The question is how many exchanges are operating at fractional reserves? I guess that +50% or more.
When the panic starts, it will trigger withdrawals ... and we will see.
The solution is a non-custodial exchange with full transparency of the clients account on blockchain.
There are some trading platform to be launched this year : Digitex, BBOD, Leverj...we will see :)

Additionally, nice summary of ETFs proposal.
Personally I like this article, no hype, unbiased analysis for beginners.

" Despite all the hype, some sceptics suggest that ETF delays are usual, with[ Copper being the last ETF to pass through the SEC]( With their reasoning, the likelihood of an ETF being approved in 2018 is minimal. However, regardless of whether a decision happens in the next few months or not, the market has certainly been responding rapidly to both positive and negative news. The first Winklevoss twins ETF denial news caused a flash crash which quickly corrected, whilst the delay of the major CBOE proposal caused a more prolonged fall in Bitcoins valuation. Ultimately, the market appears to be in a stalemate until a further delay, approval or disapproval occurs. The latter would likely cause a long-term downtrend, whilst an approval could see prices increase exponentially. As the 30th of September looms, the market tension builds. Be sure to have a plan for all situations to ensure one maximises or minimises the ETFs impact. "

key insight from the article:
speed will be at the same level as binance...in terms of the private key...You do not trade directly from your private ethereum account, instead you deposit coins into your personal contract (smart contract wallet) which does not have private key, it has associated code, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (calls) received from BBOD main smart contract. The point is that BBOD does not hold private keys to your funds (like Binance does). The BBOD's custody solution works similar to IDEX but is far more cheaper. Looks promising!
