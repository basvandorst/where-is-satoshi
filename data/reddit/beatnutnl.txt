Theoretically yes

One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)
Given that k = 1.38×10-16 erg/K, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2 K, an ideal computer running at 3.2 K would consume 4.4×10-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.
Now, the annual energy output of our Sun is about 1.21×1041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7×1056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.
But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.

Wouldn t dollarcents be better, since it is the lowest possible unit (ignoring sub sat lightning transactions)

You sign the transaction yourself and input the change address yourself, so if the transactions gets added to a block, you are the only one deciding where to.

My point is: both values are based on trust. Nothing else.

Explain to me in detail how this is different from lets say: Dollar, Euro, Yenn, Etc etc. It literally holds no value, only the illusion of value which makes it valuable. It is the trust that it is worth somewhat the same in the near future. FIAT, or bitcoin are no different in that way.

If you limit blocksize and need to use LN to scale are the mining fees going to be enough?
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:59:35
But what incentive is there for the miners to mine if the block reward is 0 and the fees total due to low block sizing is not worth the effort? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 08:35:43
But what if there can be only 800 tx because of block size limitations. Those fees have to be HUGE to support global trade for people to load their funds to a LN node right? How will this scale?

Like i said. Just some, probably pirated, pdf files in a folder called books. If i check properties and see what pc created it i see  PC_Home

I havent done anything with it yet. Iam scared to be incriminated if i put the wallet.dat in the appdata

I think ill do that thnx
