You do realize betting any amount for any % at that site is -EV right?

No he wasn't easy to find, what was easy however was making sure that he cannot be found at all. Having any kind of social media presence while doing "this" has nothing to do with hindsight, that's just being careless and stupid. 
Signatures on forums? The libertarian texts posted everywhere? The stuff on linkedin about running economic simulation project? Hollywood movies can really brainwash even the brightest amongst us i guess.

There are no strategies actually influencing anything when flipping a 49/51 coin. It doesn't matter what win% you set or what amount you bet, it has always the same expectation of you losing 51 times out of 100. Saying someone has skill in JD or that something the person did made him win/lose is a ridiculous idea.

This is the most ironic sentence i have seen in my life.

Because without the murder charges what is left? A bright kid who hacked together a site that made buying drugs a lot safer. All this at a time where large parts of the society are already calling for ending the War on Drugs anyway. All kinds of efforts would be possible (jury nullification?). 
But with murder charges in there? Forget all of that. 
If you think this is a far-fetched or a silly conspiracy theory just look at the recent history of the US of A and their realpolitik. Manufacturing the murder charges would be just another day in the office for the feds, steering the whole story in the right direction while minimizing the risks of anything funky happening.

Max win per bet is scaling based on size of the bankroll afaik so there is no risk of ruin.

You really think 80mil is a significant amount of money for the US government? Have you ever seen the US budget? :)
