Bitcoin is a distributed trustless consensus network. It lets parties reach agreement about exchanges without trusting each other or a 3rd party. The first application of this solution is a digital currency. 
This solution can be applied to other situations in which multiple parties must reach agreement about an exchange.

Moreover, the distribution of wealth is different to wealth inequality. 
Wealth distribution is simply 'who has what' and is not bad, in and of itself.
Wealth inequality is a set of advantages and disadvantages inherent in a social system that inhibit the wealth acquisition of those with less and unfairly favour those with more.

A regular, scheduled, online event taking place on each [Bank Holiday]( of the year during which mass donations are made to a Bitcoin-accepting charity such as [Sean's Outpost]( 
A large number of micro-donations occurring nearly simultaneously on a bank holiday to directly support positive social activity would be a good demonstration of the value of the bitcoin network.
If only 10% of the subreddit's subscribers donate $1.20, that's $10,000. 
If 25% donate 67 cents, that's $15,000.
A smaller group of donators might put up a sum of money that will be donated to match donations up to that amount. This might be a good demonstration of multisig/escrow.

You're kind of right. But keep in mind that a DAC is a method of automating the functions of different kinds of organisations.
Think of a government that operates as a conglomeration of competing DACs. Each DAC rewards good decision makers with more voting power and punishes bad decision makers with less. Humans that behave with prudence, compassion, and strength of will are automatically given more freedom to rightly govern as well as greater material comfort. Humans that make decisions that lead to poor outcomes for others are selected out of government.
This requires programmable, trustless interactions between humans. This is what Satoshi Nakamoto invented.

Governments do these things by the systemic application of force. Humans do not have the right to opt-out of the system. This means that freedom of will is compromised by the threat of violence. 
Time and again, governments have proven themselves irresponsible, immoral, and criminal in their spending of taxes and in their management of economies. The voting systems in place are inadequate to holding them to account.
Bitcoin offers an opportunity to have an economy managed by economists employing empirical evidence whose policies are enforced by algorithm, not the threat of violence, and are transparently debated and 'opt-in'.

I suspect that the core issue here is the misconception that "a Bitcoin" refers to something meaningful and that it is somehow equatable to "a Dollar".
People are so used to comparing national currencies to each other by using "a Dollar" or any other national currency. To equate "a Bitcoin" to "a Dollar" in the same way, we would need to compare .0000001 bitcoin with "a Dollar". 
People like whole numbers, which is part of the reason we have paper/plastic units of exchange that run on integers with a separate metallic unit of exchange that accounts for divisions of these integers. If bitcoin was at all threatened by something as trivial as the human preference for integers, then it wouldn't be the disruptive technology that it is.
People will gradually come to understand that possessing, that is recording your store of, bitcoin is more like owning x kilograms of gold, rather than owning x golds. 
We can switch our reference points over and over until we reach the .0000001 mark. Or we can try to accelerate the process by which people come to understand that bitcoin is a new concept of money that seems foreign at first, but is actually quite easy to grasp. 
How much bitcoin do I have? Rather than how many bitcoins do you own.

The internet lets people send things to each other. Things like words and sounds and videos. Bitcoin is the name for the invention that lets people send money to each other.
Before Bitcoin, everyone had to ask really, really big companies to keep our money and give it to other people. And it would take ages. No one was allowed to give each other money on weekends or holidays. And no one knew why, really. 
And, also, when the government had to pay for a war or a mistake they made, they would just make everyone's money worth a little bit less and their money worth more and then go pay for it. Which didn't make sense to anyone.
But with this new kind of money, no one gets to do that to other people. We all just get to keep our money and give it to anyone we want.

Another way to express it is to say that the next movement of the market is not defined by its current position or any previous movement. The information contained in the movements of the market does not predict future activity.
In much the same way that no matter how many times you flip a coin, the probability of the next flip coming up heads or tails is exactly the same.
Taken alone, there is no difference between the first downward movement in a crash and the last downward movement. 
Market movements may be used with other sources of information to make judgements about future market activity. But market activity itself is not useful for determining future activity.

This can be done, but the benefit of solving the MtGox debacle would likely compromise several core features/innovations. In the first article I link below, this is referred to as "Potential for Severe Confidence Degradation".
The term for 'system-level change' is 'hardfork'. A very informative look at this can be found [here]( The procedures of doing something like this give a good illustration of the decision-making processes that channel effort into bitcoin protocol work.
From the article:




You might also be interested in looking at [Coinvalidation]( This is an above-system-level change. The conversation around this particular concept demonstrates how difficult it is implement anything that would 'restore' all the coins without destructing the integrity of the system. This is the dark side of these kinds of conversations.

Some things to look at when comparing coins:
The code (robust, innovative, open source; asic resistance and decentralisation in general, block times, hashing algorithm)
Developers (peer review, improvement, responses to dynamic environment)
Real World testing
Adoption (network effects)
Ecosystem/infrastructure (exchanges, merchants, miners, nodes, start ups, services 'built ontop')
Economic parameters (deflation/inflation, fungibility, block time, etc)
If the value of a coin is backed by anything, it's the network. So we look at the health of the network and the code that defines it.

Scientific consensus and peer review are crucial elements of the scientific method and diametrically opposed to appeals to authority. In science, we need not trust anyone for knowledge. We can examine and test anything we like. However, when it is not feasible to examine or test something ourselves, we must introduce trust. To reduce the amount of trust we place in any one person or group, we distribute our trust out across the largest group of agreement, to the scientific consensus and peer review.

You're absolutely right. Buttercoin runs into the exact same problems as any other exchange. But it leverages decentralisation against those same problems.

Although your comment should certainly not be in the negative, it's useful to think of it this way: in a programmable economy, specific economic parameters can be adjusted with mathematical precision to suit human needs and environmental realities.
Bitcoin has created an economy where particular economic parameters are very difficult (and some impossible) to change. 
If these parameters are not conducive to a healthy economy they will either be adjusted, or another currency created. In the latter case, there will most likely be significant off-ramps for participants in the failing bitcoin economy to transition, just as there are now for participants in failing or less competitive fiat economies.

The proof of work system is designed to be resilient against attacks from central institutions such as governments and banks. It cannot be both oversecured and vulnerable to these institutions, as the author claims. 
The system also serves the purpose of distributing the currency in a fair way that incentivises securing of the network. Each mined block that contains no transactions performs two of the three functions of the proof of work system.
The third function, peer to peer transactions, does not require the trustlessness provided by the proof of work system. A single trusted entity could mine every block at a tiny fraction of bitcoin's hashing power.

Claim 1. The value of an appcoin depends on the 'value of the network of people holding the appcoin' and not the value of the app itself. 
Claim 2. The easier it becomes to use the appcoin for the services of the app, the less people will hold the appcoin and the lower the price will go.
Claim 3. This decrease cannot be fully offset by growing adoption.
Claim 4. Finally, as this insight becomes more widely understood, the value of all appcoins will decrease.

I'm still wrapping my head around these concepts, but my understanding is this:
A company is a set of protocols for incentivising human effort (wages, shares) monitoring performance (profit, competence indicators), and deciding on future actions (management, research). These can be automated. 
Bitcoin incentivises miners (human effort securing the network) by allocating resources  (bitcoin) to them. 
A DAC incentivises human effort by allocating resources (coin) according to information delivered via data feed. These allocated resources can represent shares in the company, voting rights, etc.

Roughly true.


Mt Gox is widely considered a less accurate measure of Bitcoin's value. It is consistently higher than other exchanges.


Mt Gox is no longer the largest Bitcoin exchange. 


The existence of illegal, online marketplaces using Bitcoin does not put growth sustainability at risk. Both their existence and their failures appear to have positively impacted growth. 


Bitcoin has not been made a 'target' due to its use in illegal activities. The US government has only been observed to want to regulate bitcoin, just like any other currency.


The FBI has in no way 'cracked down' on Bitcoin, just as the NYPD has not tried to 'crack down' on USD transmitted as small, paper 'cash' tokens used in almost all illegal, offline marketplaces. Amusingly, they would stand to lose a lot of money now if they somehow did hinder Bitcoin.


The Black Market Reloaded is the name of a different illegal, online marketplace that actually began before the first Silk Road. 


A 10% drop is the more widely used figure. This drop was corrected within days and the negative media attention appears to have contributed to Bitcoin's strong positive growth. This suggests illegal, online purchases represent a very small part of Bitcoin's appeal.


10% shifts in value are not uncommon in the Bitcoin economy. It is a new market and open to billions of people. Instability is expected.


True, but seems to contradict part of the message of the article.


A very broad statement that is partially true.


Vaguely true.


True, but is the point here simply to give the impression that bitcoin is likely to drop again? Which price movements are most representative of the market?


Was it a man? Was the creator working alone? Should the Bitcoin development team receive no mention?


Bitcoin is still in the early stages of adoption.


Misleading. Bitcoin can be used in specific circumstances although it is seeing very rapid growth in this area.


According to Bitcoincharts? What? This sentence says, "I am googling this shit as I type. We are really understaffed."


They might want to do this, and they might assist financially, but the real work is done by developers, none of whom have yet to receive a mention.


This estimate is wrong, but cited everywhere.


Raid is a quaint term to use here. It is vaguely true, in a very broad sense of the word.


This figure is also wrong, but cited everywhere. Does the FBI do anything other than 'crack down',  'raid' and 'seize'?

The bitcoin payment network, the protocol, is decentralised. Exchanges are part of the infrastructure that runs on top of bitcoin. This infrastructure may be more or less centralised, but the bitcoin payment network does not rely on this infrastructure. 
The currency of the bitcoin payment network, the actual units of exchange, they can gain and lose value relative to other currencies. This value can be influenced by centralised infrastructure. But the dollar value of bitcoin, the currency, has no bearing on the value of bitcoin, the payment network.
Decentralised exchanges are being developed.

Your questions might be ignored because they've been asked and answered so many times and a search of the subreddit would answer them for you. There's a certain due diligence required in debate.


I don't think anyone is hoping for a single, global currency. However, a digital crypto currency that can be used in every country would be an advance in efficiency and financial autonomy over current circumstances.


Bitcoin in its current form would not scale to the size most here hope to see it reach. This is a problem that has been known since the beginning and, while there is no simple easy answer, solutions have been put forward that will be implemented before scale becomes an issue.


Bitcoin's perhaps greatest innovation is its independence from and resistance to manipulation by 'the rich and powerful'. While centralised ASIC pools are a real and grave concern, no known outcomes would be fatal to the network. The cost of a direct attack against the Bitcoin network would cost more than most nations' military budgets. And any attack would be identified, analysed, and patched in an update. Consider this against the massive potential gain for any entity acting in accordance with the Bitcoin network, and you may begin to see that manipulation would require an irrational actor the size of a nation-state. The nearest we have to that is North Korea. We're not worried about North Korea. I mean, we are, but not in that way.

You're right. I was rather glib there. 
The network difficulty increases as more people mine and decreases as less people mine. As mining competition increases. the difficulty increases, and so, the cost. This rising cost squeezes miners out and reduces new entries, which reduces the difficulty, and increases profitability. 
Once the price of Bitcoin stabilises, an equilibrium will be reached.
There are a few known, potential issues. These are 2 for illustration:
1) The network adjusts the difficulty every 2016 blocks which is intended to equal 2 weeks. 
So if a large enough chunk of the network shuts off all at once, and there isn't enough processing power left in the network to solve the next block at the current difficulty, then the network would basically grind to a halt. This circumstance is extraordinarily unlikely and would be solved with an update or by restoring processing power.
2) As competition increases, so does network difficulty, and the profit margin thins, requiring greater and greater initial investments and reinvestments to match rising difficulty. 
This may centralise mining power into the hands of a few parties who must then be trusted with the integrity/stability of the network.

The belief that one crashing cryptocurrency would meaningfully damage others should be tested. As should each of your other statements. These are very thoughtful speculations that generate very useful questions, but they need to be tested.
I would contradict you on one point of belief. There is currently room in the world for hundreds of currencies. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a superior form of currency that can, at will, be used to replace present, inferior forms of currency.

Open-source, free to download, available everywhere =/= mysterious. Although the author may here be using 'mysterious' as a synonym for 'unfamiliar and curious" in order to convey the implicit meaning of "suspicious". What a wordsmith.


Enthusiastic investment in technology with broad media attention. That sounds like the last decade.


I wish Paris Hilton had only consumed a few months of media attention. Bitcoin is a "mysterious" billion dollar arena with a lot of juicy angles for the media, up to and including, FBI raids on hackers selling heroin to suburban white kids for millions of dollars that are spent on bikie gang assassinations on knitted sweater wearing, terminally ill grandparents. Whether it succeeds or not (and it has) we'll all be hearing about Bitcoin for a while yet.


The stages of tech-acceptance are: Denial by the general population; followed by Angry libertarian investment money; then journalistic Denial; and painful Bargaining with banks; then the Sadness of missed opportunities; and finally, the Acceptance of a new reality.


Pop culture references are hard, huh? Or maybe he's... playing The Devil's Advocate.


All the ones the author lists, and the thousands he didn't, plus those that understand that Computers are able to adjust one number (price in USD) according to changes in another number (price in Bitcoin). And those that prefer low to zero fees.


Correct. All those other things do.


Just like weak rhetoric for ad clicks for a once-respectable newspaper. Is the NYT too big to fail?


A vast network, populated by cooperating, self-interested parties 'controls' Bitcoin. Just like free, democratic states are populated by cooperating, self-interested voters.


No, that's due to the absence of an expensive, inefficient middleman demanding private information for the privilege of spending one's own money, and to the fact that drugs are the second most purchased good after food. 


Bitcoin is not anonymous, as implied here. But it can be traded anonymously, just like cash can be.


Being open source software, if there were a circumstance in which it did not 'work properly' it would be noticed, reported, and repaired. Since transaction volume is now greater than Western Union, we might expect a transaction fault to be noticed and reported quite quickly.


Correct. Follow this line of thought.


Every English speaking person who reads this article knows what fraud is. Why is that? Because fraud is rampant and an unavoidable element of the current financial system. The ideas behind Bitcoin offer potential solutions to fraud. Small sentence, big deal.


Not the Chinese!


Maybe get that checked out.




If any developers are reading, would you mind writing up something to release molecules of gold to my niece overseas at scheduled weekly intervals with no distribution costs, please?

Here's another 
I'm involved with this one and the new site isn't yet 100%. We're almost entirely volunteer and by no means technologically sophisticated.
But Bitcoin is so perfect for thrift/charity. I cannot wait to see the good that greater adoption will bring. And I am trying to find/create avenues for bitcoin to pass directly from donators to positive impact.

Literally every point made here is false and demonstrates a poor understanding of economics, sociology, and psychology.

Much appreciated. The Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast is a good source of news and insight.

I totally agree with you, but what I find even more exciting is that Andreas is not the one opening the windows, but simply looking out of them and telling others what he sees so that we may come to understand and appreciate their worth.
The people opening the windows are working tirelessly, out of the spotlight, constructing new avenues of human adventure and interaction and self-expression. 
And it's all out of the hands of politicians and economists who are doing great work, but should not be charged with directing my daily decisions, let alone the persistent, guiding frameworks of the human species.

Speaking as technically as you are here, there is no such thing as Bitcoin production. The term 'production' does not fit Bitcoin.


The same is true of the use of the term 'peak'


Mining will never be 'too expensive to be profitable'. As the costs of mining profitably increase and the margins of profit decrease, smaller investors will be squeezed out and bigger players will dominate. 


Bitcoin is a new kind of thing that is regulated via algorithm. Human interaction with it influences its value relative to other intersections of human interactions. This process is best thought of as cultural adjustments to a new medium of activity.


Miners are not employees. A person cannot be employed by, with, or for Bitcoin. A person can have their employment tied to other forms of money because the functionality of money is tied to the functionality of a bank or government or money provider which is expressed via persons employed. This is not the case with Bitcoin.


Not only is there no central leadership, there is no 'centre'. Any 'political' influence that affects Bitcoin is noise in the signal. The work of recording and communicating stores of wealth is accomplished by the network. Actions of a political entity, however beneficial to users, will necessarily encumber the system.


More recourse exists for Bitcoin than for physical money. Limitations on 'recourse' here are necessary for protecting individuals (read: everyone).


This has happened. Google "pirateat40". 
More importantly, suing fraudulent parties is a concept that assumes that powerful trusted third parties will resolve disagreements between weaker individuals. This arrangement is the error that Bitcoin has solved.

Litecoin is a variant of Bitcoin that has several inherent advantages.
Litecoin is more resistant to centralisation in mining, which means it is a quantitatively more democratic system and it more effectively incentivises lay people to engage in the operation of the currency.
Litecoin also has worth because it provides a competitive alternative to Bitcoin. One benefit of having a competitive alternative is that the damage of an error or compromise in Bitcoin can be ameliorated by the existence of a similar cryptocurrency.
There is no catch, edit: quantitatively

While this is incredible, it should be kept in mind that websites can still be taken down, even Tor hidden services. And broad surveillance on the scale that the NSA engages in has an almost unimaginable potential to prevent the free exchange of goods and services, and ideas. Bitcoin is a big step toward individual rights and freedom, and a foundational protocol for future liberating tech innovations, but there remains a hell of a long way to go.
