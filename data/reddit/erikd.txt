Very much true for me. ADSL2+ 2km from the center of Sydney and the best I can get is about 8Mbps. On Telstra 4G I can easily sustain double that.

If you are worried about the volatility but convinced of the basics of bitcoin, you should buy in installments. Buy a little each week. Doesn't matter if its $10 or $1000 per week, but buying in installments means the price you buy at is averaged out over the buy period.

If you believe they will make it out of this alive there are no downsides.
However this "no downsides" is based on a what I and many others consider a flawed assumption, that MtGox are indeed solvent.

Were those GoxBTC moving around inside Gox or were they BTC transactions on the public blockchain?

For a programming language to be Turing Complete is less interesting and/or useful than most people think. There are a number of research languages like Agda, Coq, Idris and others that are *not* Turing Complete. All of these languages are Dependently Typed (put simply, values can be promoted to types and types can be demoted to values) and the ideas from these languages are already influencing practical programming languages like Haskell and Scala.

We've never met before. How do I sent you $5 now with just a credit card?

They will only be able to sell coins they bought on Gox if Gox releases them and that assumes that Gox actually *has* the coins. If Gox is actually insolvent these gamblers will have lost their bet.

What kind of storage do you have on that? Just the blockchain itself is about 30Gig.

That graph is very useful, thanks.

I'm a little unclear on the difference between a "spam transaction" and a "transaction".

So maybe we should see what segwit does before deciding to ditch 2X.

I am a supporter of the block size increase but not a supported of blocking access from Tor exit nodes.
Does that mean we need another fork?

The *biggest* issue was GoDaddy's support of SOPA but many people thought their quality of service and support was poor enough to leave them for that alone.

Litecoin uses a block update interval of 2.5 minutes.

When depositng cash at an NAB branch, the transfer can happen in as little as 15 minutes, as long as the reference number is correct. If you or they screw up this reference number, it can take up to a day.
