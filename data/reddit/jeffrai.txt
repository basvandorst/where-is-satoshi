Move it from coinbase to GDAX, it's free. And then from GDAX to a wallet. Google it, it's a technique that has been explained many times on Reddit

A wallet is just a place to store your bitcoin. Technically, your bitcoin is currently sitting in a GDAX "wallet." The goal should be to move your coins off an online exchange to something offline, like a desktop wallet. This reduces the likelihood that a hacker will get your coins, and if the exchange were to suddenly shut down or undergo maintenance, you would still have access to your bitcoin. 
~~There will be a small fee to transfer the coin to the wallet~~ GDAX should be able to cover the network fees when transferring to a wallet.
Your bitcoin will not stop fluctuating - you're just moving it from one wallet to another. You're simply changing it's location.
What I personally do is move all my coins to desktop or hard drive wallets, and then track my portfolio using a phone application, like Blockchain or Delta. These types of apps just let you input the amount you own; you don't need to move the coin to the actual app. This way, you know your coins are safe in your wallet(s), but you can still track your gains/losses without having to worry about your coins sitting in an exchange.

If your ID is verified on Coinbase, you should be verified on GDAX as well. Use your Coinbase log-in on GDAX; they're the same company.

Are there any other iOS apps besides Coinbase available to purchase BTC?
