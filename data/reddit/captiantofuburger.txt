Does this get flagged for being a vpn at all? Like for netflix etc I always have had issues trying to use a vpn.

Coinstar for BTC! How is this not a thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:19:20
My last up vote put you at 666, I feel everyone should keep it this way. And also I agree with you.

I think it can be assumed I'm talking within the last 12 months or so... Clearly, it can't work like this forever, which is not what I am saying, but it's not a huge leap of faith either any entry point is still decent for the time being. Since OP was asking specifically about sustaining 12k and not "where will BTC be in X weeks/months from now" your 2013-2015 scope is not applicable.

If you're playing long you can just dump money in more or less whenever and walk out just fine (assuming bitcoin doesn't just crash and die etc). This sub is not the best for actual investment advice, people only look and care about ATH not what the market can support for the time period. I just sold out (btc is sub 11k typing this) at $11700, looking at the charts at the time it was more than obvious it couldn't sustain that price point very long. Right after it dropped down to 10850 and I just bought back in. If it wasn't sunday and if I didn't have shit to do I would sit and watch more. 
Point being, throw money at it if you want and probably be just fine. 100% success rate as of now if you just sell at higher than you bought... Sounds stupid and obvious but we have never had a sustained downward trend for more than like a few weeks tops, and it always recovers shortly after.
Anytime is a good time, if you want a deal, IMO, literally right now I would jump in at $10850 as I type this. Could go down more, but I'm happy with the $1k swing I just grabbed. It will be $11800 again before you even think to look again.

As others have said this is provided you leave everything on an exchange. The thing that worries me most is not being able to move BTC to an exchange and out fast enough. I don't want to be coming out of cold storage and sitting at 0 confirms for 12 hours while everyone else is cashing out. 
If it was a crash like that, I think it's going to be a lot easier said than done to cash out even if you see an endpoint like you described. 
We already have problems with forks, I can never get anything split and moved fast enough, the last 10k-11k-9k swing I was more or less fucked because Gemini just decided to go offline... 
Imagine a full-blown legitimate crash, I think dumb luck will outweigh being prepared in a lot of cases. As for the previous scenarios I have mentioned I think it's almost critical to keep open good accounts on multiple exchanges and to spread your money out. Don't rely on JUST Coinbase, or JUST Kraken etc... because I would bet that's a good way to get proper fucked when the zombie apocalypse happens.

I have been using them since before they took bitcoin. I have maybe a dozen IRL friends that use them too, never had an issue with them.
The poker tourneys are fun. And you can gamble on pretty much anything. Fucking wish I took trump for +5500 when I had the chance lol.
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:55:18
Ah yeah that extra 1% would account for that. I was curious where that ~$6 went. Also I wasn't sure what end and where they took the fee out from.
I understand now.
Thanks guys
@_date: 2016-06-06 16:27:41
Yeah I'm failing to see how this is any different than just using coinbases own app?
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:47:04
Probably on a soft wallet on a hard drive that got formatted or tossed ages ago haha. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 22:14:44
I've been looking at a few cards and now this. Like hell I'm going to give them my SSN. The other one wanted a scan of my passport which isn't going to happen either. 
No cards for this guy I guess.
@_date: 2016-06-07 19:11:08
Yeah I woke up late and saw it at 550, and was like what the flippty fuck. If I wasn't so late for work and could spend 5 min looking at the damn thing I would have even gone in with that.
I was just thinking about setting up limit orders yesterday. Blah
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:08:30
As of now, it's secure within reason. But also from everything you have stated, brain wallets are not a good idea to some extent.  
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:40:50
It's a flat $29.99

RemindMe! 16 days "What happened to the drive with all thE BTC"
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:15:29
About to wipe a hard drive full of VMs, then realized I thought I stuck some btc in a wallet on a few of them for some reason over a year ago. Found 1 whole btc I was about to delete.

This is what I say as well, I tried the most when it was around $400. Again huge preface that who the hell knows what will happen and you can lose it all, so don't blame me. I only recommend to family though, because we all play various markets and keep each other in the loop. 
One person won't trust me anymore, made them take a 50% loss on VW about 5 years ago when they aquired porsch. Market was set for making good money on shorts, which is what I was doing. In my defense at the loss I explicitly said that it's coming to an end and if you still want to play just put a little money in and call it a gamble. What do they do? Dump a shit ton of money into it and lose half the next day. I came out with a tiny loss from the last gamble but in the scheme of it all was up over 30% in 2 weeks.

I just talked to them actually. Getting back in touch Monday to figure out the legalities.

Brilliant, I bet they get loads of ebay bucks. I do that for work, order from newegg but off ebay. Get some free money every couple months. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 01:29:31
Oh sorry I didn't read that close enough. You are correct sir.

This thread is fucking annoying when you're an IT person. Should he have had better backups? Yes. Should he have used better security practices? Yes. Does shit just go wrong sometime? Fuck yes.
Now that we have established how things could have been prevented or minimized we can stop beating a dead rotting horse. 
You have 3 options. 1: Don't do anything, lose all your data. 2: Hope there's a decryption tool available depending on the variant of the ransomware or will be one soon. Which has the debate how long are you willing to wait? 3: Gamble, literally gamble, 10 BTC. Is 10BTC a drop in the bucket or what it's worth? Judgement call risk vs reward. 
When ransomware was just getting popular my buddys company shelled out 5 grand a few years ago to get the decrypt keys. In their case they got them. And in their case the data was worth a hell of a lot more.
This terrorism shit is fucking stupid as well. If someone robs you at gun point your same logic should be to fight the attacker than give up your wallet, because giving up your wallet encourages these activities. Also don't smoke weed because that goes to ISIS and Osama because he's still alive and chem trails man. Go Fuck yourself on that logic.
This is now disaster recovery, and only OP can decide if the 10BTC gamble is worth it. I'm assuming he did since he asked how to get it.
That being said I would be willing to sell off a decent amount of that, but for an inflated price to make it worth my time OP.

I think that mentality undermines bitcoin as a whole that it is only "used for drugs" and has no legitimate purpose. I'm personally not fond of giving up my personal information for exchanges or even with a lot of the bitcoin visa cards wanting ssn's or passport scans. I'm going out of the initial argument with these statements but I don't feel a layer of some anonymity at a premium is not unreasonable. Or I just have too much faith in humanity. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 20:52:17
I have thought about this as well. With all my bitcoin buying I decided to sign up as a seller on localbitcoins. But I only accept cash in person and say I want to meet at a bank. I figured this would be enough to deter anyone looking to do something illegal or fuck me over.
I have yet to have a sale though, so there's that. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 00:22:43
How is this any better? redzone is $15/mo from my provider, this is $10/mo and sketch. 
I have in the past paid for illegal streams, but for $5 I'm not wasting my time.

I laughed at the picture, payments turned on for everyone but fox news!

I have also never had an issue, even sign up wasn't bad at all. I picked them years ago because of their KYC AML practices (I think it was lax at the time, maybe it isn't now)
Originally I didn't use btc for investing but just use. That being said I pulled out for another issue. My hodl has become a longer hodl so I pulled out 20 some btcs for cold storage. 
I also trust no one with solvency, no matter how good they have been to me. That's just the way I operate. I also wear a tin foil hat from time to time too. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:55:54
^This. Why is no one else thinking this? You can't have a dead mans switch when you're riding on someone else's lap.
@_date: 2016-07-29 20:40:35
Eh I bought one, I hope you are the seller. My last bands for various things broke after 8 years of use. Bitcoin? Why not. Just feels weird not having any on.
