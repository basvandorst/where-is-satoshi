since my wallet is $0, it appears the recovery has more to do with the guiminer and where the pool was kept and them not paying out. 
I checked the guiminer logs and I see references to:

No transactions are showing at all, I don't remember the website looking so clean before. Guiminer still seems to be around.

that website looks familiar!  thank you I'll try that!
EDIT: My Bitcoin Wallet 0 BTC $0.00
Imported Bitcoin Addresses 0 BTC $0.00
Did all those mining fractions of btc just go away?  I've found reference to a &lt;username&gt;.worker1 which I believe was for the guiminer program.  Anything I'm missing or is this case closed?

Case closed!!!
I checked the FAQ (formatting reminds me of the good old days of btc), looks like they automatically delete accounts and the rewards stay with the pool.  
At least I can tell my past self, "You were right, your btc wallet will be worth $0 in the future."
Thanks again for the help!

also stumbled over a "guiminer" folder which must've been the hot mining software of the time.  Not sure if that helps solve this. Thanks again.

I think this case can be closed.
I checked the FAQ (formatting reminds me of the good old days of btc), anywho, looks like they automatically delete accounts and the rewards stay with the pool.

Thanks everyone it was cool to find my wallet again!
