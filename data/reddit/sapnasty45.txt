Global warming doesn’t exist. The whole solar system was warming via sun cycles. Now it’s called “Climate Change” and we can’t have a real discussion about it because anyone who points out the obvious facts that it’s meant to deindustrialize the US/ 1st world while slapping us with a carbon tax (we exhale carbon so essentially a breathing tax). 
This is a real issue and can be solved but not when China and other countries can have no carbon cap on emissions. In the mean time small town USA is shut down and turned into Meth/ Heroine shit holes when the industries fail or move due to government regulations. 
Make the coal and steel industries cleaner until clean renewable energy can be implemented functionally on a large scale AND get foreign nations to clean up their act so their emissions cap is equal. 
Until that is done Al Gore And the “global warming” crowd can kick rocks because their end game has nothing to do with bettering the planet.
Edit: said universe, meant solar system.

There is only very little truth to your statement and let me break down to you why that is. 
You can talk about “historically” but you ignore the history of who we are as humans. Long before civilization was established it was just men and women.  Both sexes carrying out the task they needed to do to keep alive and the human race moving forward. 
To make it very simple, the men were the workers and the women were the home makers. Men couldn’t do when women did and the women could do what men did but they played the part of home maker as generations continued to grow. 
Fast forward 1000s of years until 1970ish. Now although a lot of women were content with continuing to be the homemaker but you seen the push for women’s rights (Good you deserve them, put up with our  BS since begging of time). YET the majority of women still chose the housewife life. 
Just like if you show a chicken coup the shadow of a hawk, it’s in its their DNA to freak the fuck out and hide, even though they’ve never dealt with the real threat. 
Fast forward to current day, it’s not exactly an equal playing field for women but its pretty damn close. A lot of women are still housewife/home makers and Men are just the majority of the risk takers. That’s the way this cookie crumbles. You can’t change the molecular structure of our society and the more you parade around with your “pervasive misogyny” accusations the less accepted you’ll be. 
This is my fact based opinion and I hope it opens things up for you. Hard work and dealing with the hand your dealt will always earn you respect vs complaining and pointing the finger at the opposite sex.

Well I’m done with this debate, Calling history/ evolution how I see it doesn’t make me a sexist. 
I Took a brief minute to scroll through your history and I respect your dedication to the the feminist movement but you seem to have your blinders on to reality. You’re passionate but it seems you’re also obsessed w/ pushing your anti-man agenda. Putting an umbrella over a group and blaming males just causes more division and doesn’t solve the imbalances we have in places like the blockchain space. Good day and best of luck to you w/ your investments.

How are you going to throw an umbrella over the community and call us all assholes and then take it a step further  to single out the males ? You’re clearly the sexist one here. 
We are about decentralization and less government, sex has nothing to do with it AT ALL. So If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. Now get your sexist BS accusations out of here.

I understand completely why you wouldn’t want to gamble with this but how much of your payments were in crypto? 
Also the retailers who are still accepting means they still believe so if they’re holding that BTC and just accumulating in this bear market they will potentially see a lot lager gains if/when it recovers, which I believe it will. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:07:29
Yup, Pay extra for the same headaches you get with a bank? 
If you can budget your shit the bank will give you little to zero headaches and if you plan accordingly you can even make money off banks and credit cards. 
Also, I clearly stated “some exceptions apply”. Please read more throughly.
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:00:33
People without bank accounts usually use Western Union and them ridiculous check cashing places.  
A lot more could be said about these people but one who doesn’t want a bank account and pays extra for check cashing/ processing services are finically irresponsible. There are some exceptions but it’s unreal how 90%+ in the PJs pay their rent with this bullshit. 
Could bitcoin better them? Probably but as a wise man once told me.......You can bring the mule to the water but you can’t make it drink.

Two. You don’t have to buy a whole BTC, you could by X and get % gains off that. 
Yea, just like any exchange/ broker you link it to your bank account and buy/ sell and report gains to IRS
Edit: Also report losses because there aren’t winners without losers.

Wtf are you talking about
Donuts for? The OP asked about advice on investing 10K, did you read my comment?  It says low volatile stocks, something a little risky like BTC and there’s a second paragraph that discusses a potential land investment depending on OP location. I wasn’t like “BUY BTC its the second coming of Christ”. My post was very moderate and even included the word advice.

This is an assumption but I know Robinhood makes interest off all the cash kept in the accounts on their trading platform.

He is down to like 3K after 6 years of just slaving away to pay minimum interest.
