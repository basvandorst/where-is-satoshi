Why would people go buy something that they don't even know much about. 
Spend fiat money with a fee for virtual money that can only be spent in limited places for another fee. And the cash out  for a lambo, or emergency, incur another fee that is either hidden in price of item, or at the exchange.

Most speculators are waiting for a drop in price. If it takes off, oh well, but there seems to be plenty of supply, and still a ton being minted everyday. 
Its not like the average person can purchase any goods with bitcoin in real life.

I'm waiting for the tortoise to offer more before I help. I ain't helping for charities sake.
Your tortoise keeps on breeding more tortoises that lay on its back. Its not a rare resource. 
First sign of a serious infection, and these tortoises not going to be worth much.

Gold is tangible but the stock market is not. Id rather have gains from gold, than 7x gains in the stock market. That could all be gone tommorow.

I think these recent price drops are collusion between mega banks as a false flag into lulling the weak minds into a false sense of panic. When price drop at certain point, they going to swoop in and buy all the coins ensuring the greatest profit and minimum transfer of wealth.

It may be fake, but it may be real. Sometimes you have to take calculated risks. If this was a scam, youd only be out 1k if you invest wisely across many opportunities.
Better to test the waters, and sleep peacefully knowing you tried to hedge your bets.

You pay them x for contract, they buy a little bitcoin every month based off percentage, and keep margins. They ask you to refer people, and give bonus from referrals. 
Once signup rates stop, they shut down.

Doesn't that mean there are 79 electrons for every gold atom?

Shouldve stayed with bitcoin for the herd immunity. altcoins can go pound sand.
