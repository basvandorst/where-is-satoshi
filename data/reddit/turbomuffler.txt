Ethereum is a fork and the original was renamed Ethereum Classic.

2018 will surely be the year of Linux on the desktop.

Yeah, every post I see nowadays is shitting on some other coin when I just don't care.  From the outside it looks like Apple vs Android fanboys.  This sub is losing interest and credibility.

On what grounds?  They barely have the developers to keep the three coins they run up with any considerable reliability.  You think they should (and are legally required to) add support for another coin for free?

Oh okay like just a withdrawal?  Yeah that would be easy enough for their devs.  I don't know what excuse they would have for not doing that.  Maybe buying back all the ETH they promised back after the flash crash?

The risk is that maybe 150 guys with machine guns ransack the servers and banks and take your assets before your transaction is complete.

From my light research it appears that you can only withdraw money to a Zimbabwean bank account.  So yes, either the guys with machine guns seize the servers and all private keys, or they guys with machine guns seize the banks.  Both sides are a risk.
Let me propose this: you sign up for a bank account in Zimbabwe, you transfer a bitcoin to Golix, you sell it for $13k USD, you withdraw your USD to your Zimbabwean bank account.  Maybe it clears in 5 business days.  Maybe it disappears.  What are you gonna do, sue?  Who?  How?  There is the risk.

Okay duckface it on your instagrams, "Let's Play" it to your twitch viewers, and fuck it on tinder.

No.  People demanding sources for reasonable claims often get downvoted.
Edit: lol actually it was me I'm an asshole.  Fixed.

Yeah I got a good book for you:
What The Dormouse Said: How the 60's counterculture changed the personal computer industry
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:24:57
No way.
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:29:19
It touches on it and shows the history behind it.  Have you read it?
Oh a downvote.  So you just want to be difficult.  Whatever man.
