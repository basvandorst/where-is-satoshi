The train left fucking years ago. Now it's all peasants digging for scraps.

Did programmers in the 1980s actually believe the year 2000 would never come? It feels like that's how they acted.

It also follows the theme of using an algorithm to solve a problem. He was using a single thread however (his own two hands), when he could have used a "GPU" (many speed-cubers solving their own "part" of the overall problem). :\^)

Switch to XFCE for a day and look at how much CPU you're saving, for one. I'm not even trying to hate Unity. I installed Ubtuntu 13.10 last year and it still ran horribly so I installed XFCE until I installed Debian the other month.
Another thing is that Ubuntu hates you if you dare switch your desktop environment.

Has anyone ever told them that they're a genius? because they're a genius.

I guess an Nvidia GTX 760 isn't dedicated enough for you.
Go ahead and try changing your DE in Ubuntu and tell me it doesn't break.

I don't know much about ATMs, but how would they even function if they aren't connected to the internet?

Thanks, I couldn't tell with the blurriness if it was the baht or some other $-like symbol with two intersecting S's. Also, I really feel for you in some way. You must be really annoyed to have to explain this to people over and over again. At least I posted with the benefit of the doubt as opposed to that guy.

People will take cryptocurrencies more seriously when the vast majority of users stop using it as an investment platform and actually use it as money to pay for things *without* first exchanging for dollars/etc.

Heh. "Buying" Bitcoin...

I wonder if my .0025 BTC will finally be worth something.

You'd need to get every miner's client to agree on this code change, wouldn't you?

Suddenly I'm very glad I fauceted myself 2.5 mBTC back in October.

This was the best act of trolling I've seen in a long time.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:43:45
But it feels like I did nothing and suddenly I don't care about how other people actually work for their money.
So this is what rich people feel like.

I always laugh and scoff at these idiots when they think they have any control whatsoever on this issue.

The thought of a large bitcoin GDP has always tickled my fancy.

I'm sorry but what a dumbass.
