U are in bankruptcy, which is where they are quickly headed

Ya you would have thought those BTC would have been locked :(

a Bitcoin exchange that survives for 10 years, lmao

I fail to see how my usd is considered their asset to redistribute if they loose bitcoins. They can liquidate what THEY own and pay off losses. My money != their money. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:48:59
Bitfinex was not a bank doofus
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:35:06
There are the angry children who want to "make them pay" like somehow getting fucked out of another 20% and a few years (even more valuable!) of my money will really make BFX owners really sad! /s
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:03:04
I think you can keep carrying the loss forward until it is eaten up.
Be careful though if you need to show income on your taxes over the next few years (securing a mortgage etc.)

No you're right, using a 0 in a handle is very unusual. Congratulations Inspector Gadget. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:49:43
Yes somehow they think that a high risk 'digital token' getting stolen means they can redistribute other's USD as they see fit. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:43:08
I see a lot of people chatting that all the USD customers have stored with them could be used for liquidation and paying off debts when filing for bankruptcy...
However that money wasn't an investment in Bitfinex? The money isn't theirs, so how on earth could it be used to pay off their businesses losses? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:57:12
The real question
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:51:21
Ya I'm starting to think "haircut" really means "castration"

My business spends a lot of time and money dealing with PCI compliance, merchant accounts, and other fees for recurring billing services, and then our hourly rate accountants who put it all together. It's a large and annoying part of our business that takes time away from making a better product.
Why would I not want to eradicate that time and money lost, and get paid immediately rather than after 30+ days?? Payroll, inventory and such are big squeeze items for most of us SMBs who gotta wait for our money. If it's available I'll look into using it, and probably try to encourage it by charging a % or two less than CCs.
TELL ME O EXPERT OF E COMMERCE!!

That's relying on the assumption that open source is somehow more secure than closed source just because you publish your code.
Lots of bugs have existed as possible private 0 days for long periods of time in open source projects. Heartbleed being a recent one in a hugely popular project.

Ahh I was wondering who wrecked America. It was the minorities as usual!!!
@_date: 2014-09-13 22:31:10
The company I work for will give a 2% discount for Bitcoin purchases. 
We experience less fees and overhead  so we can charge less than a manual invoice (that costs us a ton as a person is sitting there mailing stuff and we pay them by the hour!!) or CC payments (PCI compliance for BTC doesn't exist.) 
Once a business is comfortable with the concepts it is much simpler than dealing with the old methods of payment.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:18:25
PROBABLY SHOULD JUST KEEP USING THIS HERE WAMPUM TO PURCHASE BEADS, I DON'T SEE THIS US GOVERNMENT THING TAKING OFF. TOO COMPLICATED WITH ALL THESE LAWS AND RULES, THEY COULD FAIL AT ANY SECOND AND BESIDES WHAT THE HELL IS SOME SCRAP OF PAPER WORTH LOL
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:53:25
How will you deal with the mostly terrible upload speeds of a typical consumer internet connection here in the States?
I would rather pay more and have my file now rather than pay less and wait far longer.
Do you pay more for a node with a faster connection?
@_date: 2014-09-13 22:37:43
Those same countries also frequently experience very high inflation, so people buy USD or other currencies as a sort of hedge against loosing what they save to inflation 10 years down the road. They then stuff that money somewhere and hope it doesn't get stolen.
Bitcoin helps them convert out of their native, inflation prone shitcurrency and store the money securely in an encrypted "paper" wallet for long term savings.
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:02:12
Except this is a bonus. 
Unless you got a Clark Griswold pool dilemma going on, probably not relying on a bonus.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:09:22
Ahh, ok!
So if hypothetically there are two nodes on the whole network, both with  1TB of possible storage but one is on a 100mbit up/down link and the other a lowly cable modem with 20mb/s down &amp; 1mbit/s upload (like mine) are they compensated differently?
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:16:13
Having a full third party audit is certainly very responsible of you and possibly controversial. Those usually take quite a few months. I could see lots of impatient speculation during this time.
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:34:09
And you always pay on time I suppose? Otherwise how would your credit card company stay in business giving you all that "free" money?
Anyway, the example I gave of our business, sees transactions in excess of $10k at a time and a credit card is never used for those. Even over $300/mo recurring and over 80% of clients start paying by check. Many business don't want to rely on high interest cards for their purchases.
@_date: 2014-09-13 22:24:39
Right. But a business can't do that without having their funds confiscated and PayPal account closed.
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:54:26
You sent money to people who sell drugs dummy, but yes let us blame Coinbase!!!!!11 NAZI PIGZ
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:54:26
This is correct. I poked around their code for the Zen miner stuff in August and it was basically just some python scripts. All these claims about the tremendous technology they have 'in progress' is a total joke. They could barely keep the hosted ASICS online back when they actually had them hosted and people were remotely controlling them. They got their initial cash infusion by selling ASIC miners for HUGE markups. 
I made a few posts asking questions about how these new services were going to work at the end of summer and all posts were deleted. Even the employees don't really know what's going on over there.
People like this will ruin crypto for the rest of us.
But don't worry, Josh will fly off to Thailand with tens of thousands of laundered BTC in cold storage telling the FTC and IRS he has nothing to confiscate.
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:48:13
Not quite... It's like giving the money to the drug dealer and saying hold on, now I can't decide what I want, so many choices!!!

Wasn't this called Coffee Time at Hellas? They had a Greek thing going and I liked it.

This happened a bunch when I went to France. Paying for a 5 euro item with a 20 or something and the vendor told me to get lost. Hahaha. I thought it was great. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:21:38
You're not missing out on much right now. There's not much here.
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:37:29
Yeah that's the real catch here. Almost everyone would have sold at $100 or maybe $200 etc. 
This fantasy scenario always shows up because someone lost/forgot the drive they were using to mine coins on otherwise they prob would ha e sold much earlier as well. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 13:04:09
Or when price subsequently crashes: goddammit I knew I should have sold when it got close to 1000
@_date: 2016-02-10 03:34:01
Great read, thank you.
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:25:17
For real! I took a check once, but it was certified and I called the bank to verify funds before signing the car title over.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:10:22
really insightful, thanks

Everyone is screaming moon all the time here but goes insane when regulations come around.
The other 99.9% of people aren't going to put their money into something that is perceived as a scam with zero regulations or safety checks.
NYS regulations will make the dream of BTC moon a reality.
This of course opens the door for anonymous alts to take over as the libertarian freedom boner coin.
