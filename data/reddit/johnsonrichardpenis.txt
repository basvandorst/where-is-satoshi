For someone who sounds so sure you are spectacularly wrong!
Gold is a metal, and it conducts FAR better than most, as it has 2 6s-orbital electrons and 9 5d-orbital electrons. These contribute to passing the electrical current. This electron configuration is similar to copper (Cu), yet gold's electrons are in higher shells, further from the nucleus, so they have less electrical attraction to the nucleus and are more easily available to participate in a current flow. 
Jesus...this is commonly accepted. Gold is a lousy conductor....lol...
Bitcoin is a concept and a lousy pyramid scheme. It is primarily used to distinguish gullible simpletons from...not so gullible simpletons.

Your reply and post history demonstrate the worthlessness of your input.

You mean the minor value of crypto miners’ efforts, the changes within socio-power paradigms which will shift the potentials of home-based crypto miners in the very near future, or do you mean to infer you do not understand cryptocurrency and thusly will not add more from an abbreviated condescending retort?
There are plenty of points to address in my post. The energy used to mine is restrictive, as is the cost of GPUs. This brings to mind another growing murmur...
Interesting how the DRAM manufacturers of the world are being investigated for collusion. Wonder if GPU manufacturers employed intelligent folks to create a pyramid bordering on the lottery, with smaller and deeper returns at the onset, filtering to smaller and smaller returns (not unlike....a pyramid). 
So...do you know anything about crypto? Be it currency, cryptography, or otherwise? You are welcome to PM if you do not want to be annoyed by plebs.
