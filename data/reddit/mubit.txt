Is it possible to combine the results? There are 2 statistics I'd like to see:
- Age compared to the bitcoins spent
- Age compared to the bitcoins owned

Sounds like the reactions to the internet 20 years ago. People didn't see the added value and were convinced that posting information for free was never going to happen. Big internet boom took almost 10 years to happen. Looking at all activities going on around BTC at this moment, I'm willing to wait for an other 5 years to see where BTC will bring us.
I'm not trying to talk people out of divesting, as others already mentioned "cheaper Bitcoins for us". Consider where we are now and where we might end up. Compare it to something like the Internet and reconsider the reasons why you would divest.

This idea is pretty scary imho. It will be a snowball effect that will hit the late adopters extremely hard.

Please create a proper English page. You talk about a world wide community and only having a Swedish site is not going to help that.

Do they require the fiat money?
Find some local shops/merchants that accept Bitcoins and no conversion is needed at all.

Yay! I just made my 1st BitCoin donation ever!

Ok, there is some path to go. But in the end it can gain them by not having to pay interest for their debts.

And by the looks of it, other dutch news sites are just blindly copying this ridiculous news flash. 
Ah... Now there is comming some sense. They dropped the "producing fake bitcoin" part and now only talk about the stolen electricity:

Very clear. Thanks!

What deflationary problem?

My biggest concern is what happens to the old monetary systems when Bitcoin is indeed going to be **the** accepted currency. What happens to the non-adaptives like elder people.

Please make this a sticky one! :-)

Hi KimI|Sung_, great initiative! 
However, there is piles and piles of information on secure programming you need to get yourself familiar with. Some of them are already mentioned here (race conditions, use of floats is tricky). 
I will try to find some time look into your code later today.  
Oh, and apart from the secure coding, keeping up good spirit is very hard but extremely important!!!

In my opinion it does give a bit of an answer. The point is that there are people that put money in BTC that they cannot afford to loose. After some time of not having a value raise, they chicken out and sell. This causes the price to drop and even more people with money they cannot afford to loose start selling. It gives a panic avalanche that slowly starts and builds up to what we have seen the last few days. 
Unfortunately, it is not yet clear when the avalanche hits the bottom or is at the "bounce of the dead cat" point.

I think that the Intermediate Code symbol looks very much like a pierced d*ck. (pardon my language)

Awesome story. Congratulations on recovering the BTC!

Excellent idea!
Can exchanges be motivated to support this idea to ensure a steady cash flow?
