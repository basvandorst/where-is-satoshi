What celebrity douche would you put your money behind to make that happen?

Yes, that thought had crossed my mind, I asked her to login to her account from a different browser, but it showed the same QR code.
localbitcoins support is subpar...

Who's error, mine hers, or both of us?
What should have been done? 
What would you have done in that situation?
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:11:16
I was being cheap. If I followed localbitcoins escrow process it would have cost me 1%. I paid from my wallet on my phone (bitwallet) to her (supposed) localbitcoins wallet.
If I had done the transaction through localbitcoins escrow (put 1BTC from my wallet on bitwallet into my localbitcoins wallet and then sent it to her based on a transaction request that went to my localbitcoins account from her localbitcoins account) then I may have had some recourse through localbitcoins dispute. But I had done this type of deal in the past and nothing seemed out of the ordinary to me this time.

In some ways I agree, when I saw Bitcoin go to $1000 I wanted it to all just fall apart because it seemed wrong in some sort of basic way.
However making fiat with internet funbux looked pretty good to me.
Overall I am ahead as far as profit is concerned from exchanging Bitcoins for fiat, so I will most likely continue. Of course I will operate future transactions in a different manner though.

Last point should read: She made 1BTC in this case I think
But, yes in any case I was out 1BTC and she was out nothing (In the end at least, as she had given me the money before I sent the coin) . If she actually made 1BTC is the question I was dealing with, and not necessarily my problem, but my personal issue.

Yes, it showed up on blockchain, then got divided up with a tumbler while we sat there and watched.
The issue I had wasn't that it didn't show up on blockchain, but that it never showed up in her localbitcoins account (the account I had sent to).
I'm not entirely sure if she scammed me or just got scammed herself through a security compromise of her computer.
I have heard about working exploits that target computers making bitcoin transactions to replace the QR and printed address with an attackers address, so that if someone were to send to an address they thought was controlled by the person using the computer it would actually go to the address controlled by the attacker.

I know, right! I think that might have been the social engineering part, or it might have not even been her scamming. The QR number on my phone matched the number printed below on her account though.

Thats something I spent 2 hours thinking about during the transaction, honestly, it could have been either way. Either she scammed me or her account was compromised in some way.
I understand both would have been her fault, but the way her account looked, not showing that I actually sent her any coins, if it was me on the other side of the deal I would have felt like I was getting scammed.
As to what app I used: bitwallet on my locked iPhone
She used a QR code generated on her localbitcoins account, she had a macbook
She didn't seem suspicious or shady, but you never know.

Thats all true. Im quite sure the bills were not counterfeit. All new hundreds (I would have balked if she handed me $400 in 5's and 10's), if they were they had the proper texture and all visible security features.
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:56:56
I know, right!
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:17:53


That is my problem, I am in a personal situation where it would have looked bad if I had not given her the money back and the police had become involved. I mean, 99.999% of cops don't know what Bitcoin is, but they do understand me having $400 she just gave me (recorded on the coffee shop cameras, another thing the cops would understand) in my pocket.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:25:04
It looked online to me, in the address bar it went to the website, not a local copy, although I suppose that could be an exploit vector as well.
I'm in a (personal and professional) social situation where I can't do things like just say "tough luck, you just got scammed", "oh you want your money back? fuck off!".
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:12:34
If they were, they were good enough that I could have passed them anywhere.
I doubt they were counterfeit.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:29:04
It's worth 1btc, because that's what they are asking for the list.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:34:47
Wow that’s crazy high. I was buying and selling between $300 and $600, I don’t think I’ll get back in until it’s $300-$600.
Don’t sell at $3500, sell for at least $4000. That way you can cover the missed opportunity cost of other more stable investments.

This would be good advice for a non speculative investment during an actual dip. A 70% decline in less than 2 months is not a dip, it’s a collapse.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:59:38
I’m not trying to get bitcoin for $0, if it was worth $0 why would I want it?
You are welcome to buy as much as you want, but if you can’t sell it then it’s worth $0.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:31:48
Yeah, 90% one year, 70% a year and a half later. It’s almost as there is no reason for bitcoin to be any particular value, it could be worth $100 or $100,000 and could swing in value just as much depending simply on how people feel.
I sure would hate to be holding bitcoin bought at $50,000 when it *corrects* 70%!
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:10:05
You are using that analogy incorrectly. Let me help you:
If you have 1BTC and it looses 50% of its value, you still have 1BTC. If you have 1 share of stock in XYZ company and it looses 50% of its value, you still have 1 share of stock in XYZ company.
No need to thank me, you are welcome.
