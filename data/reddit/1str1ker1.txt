Yeah what a joke, there is no way it will take 4 months to get to 100k

actual quote from a coworker, "bitcoin looked too expensive, so I bought a litecoin instead"

It's obvious that he talks like that to appeal to the average voter. I mean, have you ever stopped and listened to average people speak, it's pretty stupid sounding.

As a new holder, this post worries me. I have a nano s on order and was planning on setting it up as segwit. Should I just go with legacy to avoid problems?

Now this is the shitposting that I subscribed to this sub for. Keep up the good work

Start by searching for the bitcoin whitepaper. It's the original idea of bitcoin. If it doesn't make sense, you may need to watch some videos on keys and encryption. After that, there is a FAQ on the right side of this sub that is very helping.

This is a common misconception. If you just but and hold an index fund like SPY over a long period of time, it averages about 10%. People usually get worse because they poison their 401k with bonds and other crap

I was planning on buying the Ledger Nano S. I just thought it would be good to check with the community is case something better has come out. With how fast Bitcoin technology changes, I wouldn't be surprised if the best wallet changes in a month.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:28:35
yeah, I see no reason to sell more than 100k at a time, you could do that without even knocking down a wall on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:19:11
You can still buy on whatever exchange you use, then more to the wallet when you want to store it safely
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:44:27
You forgot to put "/s" at the end
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:47:02
You can simplify this with almost everything in schb since it away has small and large call, and 5 - 10 in whatever for fun
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:21:30
Is there a place to view the average transaction fees for segwit wallets
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:25:09
The reason is family. If I convinced my dad to put a sizable amount of money into an investment that went south I might feel obligated to help as well. Side note: this is why I never give investment advice.

When Bitcoin was around 30% the narrative was the market dominance doesn't matter.

TBH, I don't quite get the appeal of Lamborghini either. It looks like an overpriced steam engine compared to a Tesla.

Somehow I think Ver will use this as proof that Bitcoin is centralized.
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:35:16
I judge the market based on how many people are pessimistic in the daily thread. Currently about 80&amp; of comments are "see you at 2k"

How much do you think the owner is making off of this?
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:48:28
Much lower fees using GDAX. Since they are run by the same company, you will already have a GDAX if you have a Coinbase account.
@_date: 2018-11-03 03:51:22
You could still buy a few thousand before anyone noticed.

I guess it will drop quite a bit after hitting $1M in 2020

This is true only is the case of electric heating. A gas heater should be more efficient

The two leading hardware wallets are the ledger nano s and the trezzor. They are both good and cost around $100 after shipping. This is the most secure way to store your coin. As mentioned below, you can run a software wallet on your computer or on your phone (electrum for example), but they don't have the advantage of being completely cutoff from the internet. They are probably secure, but it may pay off to be more careful if you have a large amount of money and go with a ledger nano s or trezzor
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:12:36
Sounds like some liberal owned surveys to me /s
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:21:41
If you make a purchase from a savings account, they will hold your coins up to a week before you can do anything with your them. The rate is locked in, so as long as you click buy, it doesn't matter how long it takes for them to take your money from savings. If you don't like the forced hold period, you can use a credit card, but the fees are a bit high (up to 5% when you add them all together) and some credit cards are blocking bitcoin purchases
Also, this isn't a dumb question, if you are thinking it, it's likely that a lot of others are as well

This guy finally gets it. In the long term, these don't matter

As much as coinbase has problems, this is very true. I remember trying multiple different exchanges without getting verified before I found coinbase, honestly I probably wouldn't be a holder if it weren't for them

Except the Bitcoin dot com website literally had an artical saying Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin. Seems legit to a noob

maybe sideways though, my official TA is that it could go up, but has an equal chance on falling through its support levels. If neither of these happen, it will hold steady for a while.
@_date: 2018-07-18 01:04:15
Now that I think about it, I got it backwards. They sell when they start the short and buy when they end the short, so the price should drop if there are a bunch of new shorts beginning
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:23:36
When shorts get liquidated they have to sell, right? Doesn't selling make the price slightly decrease since it removes the top buy order
@_date: 2018-07-10 02:45:44
Lol, at our current rate more like 2023
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:20:25
What are the fees at currently?

that's the point...

If Bitcoin can be "manipulated" then the project has failed.
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:37:33
What's with the downvotes, this guy has a legitimate point. Bcash is a sort of A/B test on the block size. Seeing how the test goes is helpful to the community
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:00:07
great idea, just make sure that you don't do anything like posting your plans online for the IRS to start an audit.

For people who both spend and hold, do you use a hardware wallet for your reserves and a phone app with a smaller amount for daily spending? I assume you don't want to carry the ledger everywhere that you go.
