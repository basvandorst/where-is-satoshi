Machine politics. She has kept her thumb on the neck of every major donor and activist in the state. No one credible is willing to run against her because she would destroy them during the campaign. See also: Hillary Clinton

You're right. It isn't a currency. I want to refine money though.  Bitcoin is a payment method. Just like ETF, just like a credit card, just like cash. It isn't money in the sense that it has inherent value or is backed up by the threat of legal force, it's money in that it's a way to settle debts using a low-cost lowest common denominator as an intermediary store of value  (and in a broader sense record ownership over the value).

Could you explain how the idealistic vision put out differs from the reality?

This is by far the best answer in this thread. I am not familiar with the specifics of Estonian law or government (though the country seems lovely and I'd love to spend a few years there) but based on my knowledge of various legal systems - it sounds like the court did the right thing here.  
Courts aren't designed to make law, only interpret specific cases in the context of established doctrines and statutes. Here, there was a legitimate difference of opinion over the interpretation of a statutes applicability and the court did the least invasive thing possible. From what I read briefly, the Court acknowledged that a legislative change would resolve the issue and categorize cryptocurriencies differently. 
OP- I'm sorry you lost your case. That sucks but it happens sometimes. Part of doing business anywhere in the world.  I don't think you have a human rights violation here but what do you have to lose by trying right?  It also sounds like your lawyer sucked - being good is why they make lots of money. The upside is that you can work to change the laws and this happened before a criminal lawsuit with multimillion dollar penalties lawsuit hit you hard and stuck you in jail.  It isn't much of an upside but thems the breaks.

Warren Buffet: I have a vested interested in keeping you away from Bitcoin/crypto commodities and in the stock market where I have all my money.

There is some truth to the idea that the block chain is the most important aspect of bitcoin.  That said, there is also some evidence that the payment system aspect would be incredibly valuable without this specific underlying technology.
It is symbiotic.

If you're making enough profit with BTC transactions that they might prosecute you, you are making enough to hire a good lawyer to set up your tax portfolio to pay minimal amounts.  
Also, I would be SHOCKED if they decided to prosecute anyone.  Cryptocurrency interpretation under the IRA is still in a really grey area - It isn't in the government's interest to risk an adverse ruling that shifts BTC into a 988 transaction.
