I just noticed that some of the peaks and bottoms form diagonal straight lines. The 2nd one from the bottom just got touched on the recent drop. I'd draw it a few weeks ago.

[Cointracking.info]( do it. I guess they reason that when the price is up there's more demand so people are willing to pay higher prices.

If you have to ask, it's not worth selling. If it's all over the news, it's time to sell.

I think there is a risk carrying your ledger with you. Would you walk down the street with gold in your pocket? Someone could hold you at knife point and force you to transfer your bitcoin away.

Steer clear of electrum. They have a history of security vulnerabilities and is not suitable for inexperienced users. I have used Coinomi for a while with no problems.

Yes I've been there. The masternode community is rife with scammers. I dodged a bullet once when I thought an official team member was helping me on discord.

By the same note, by the same method used by the hacker, the Electrum team could have sent a warning to users.

I know exactly how it works thank you I was just giving the simple version. Also this post isn't here to debate who's fault it is. In response to your comments, stolen property is stolen property regardless of whether it's physical or digital and therefore bitcoin should be treated in the same manner as a stolen TV or car etc... If the stolen property reaches a market place the market place has legal responsibility to protect their buyers from accepting stolen goods. Also the bitcoin address is part of the malicious code so it can be proven the funds were taken by illegally. Yes the funds may be made untraceable by various methods such as coinjoin but it appears they aren't doing that according to the article.

You obviously have plenty of time to argue against taking action to help victims of crime but I don't have time to argue with you about flaws in your argument about how hundreds or even thousands of people became victims of poorly written software. Goodnight

Just wanted to note too that I'm aware Ledger also uses a 'lite' style of wallet, but as a company they appear to be more thoroughly tested and I trust it more. Electrum have demonstrated a casual lack of judgement by allowing something like this to happen and therefore have lost any credibility as a wallet provider.

In Bitcoin Core we have been fairly aggressive about not displaying human readable text sourced from the network (peers, transactions, or blocks) to users specifically because of the potential for this kind of attack. I have previously recommended everyone else do the same, and I would continue to recommend it here.
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:50:52
Yes but it's a mistake that shouldn't have been allowed to happen.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:49:49
Hmm fair point. How would I go about proving otherwise? I can give the explorer transaction
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:05:52
I've contacted bitfinex. I don't have the proof at hand because my dad wiped his computer soon after, but I'm fairly confident I could dig up the source code of the fake version he downloaded if they requested proof.

@_date: 2019-05-23 09:42:10
Read the links I provided for details of how it works. It might not be by definition a phishing scam but it works in a similar way. Personally I have been using Electrum for a while before this. I recently moved mine to a hardware wallet. The point I'm trying to make Electrum FUCKED UP bigtime but don't want to admit it. They've since taken action to prevent the same thing from happening but by using their wallet you are putting a lot of trust in them to not fuck up again in the future.
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:33:14
Also I bought it back in 2013 but didn't check it again until 2017. During that time it was stored on bitcoin core. It's only recently that I started being more active.  I'd be interest to hear the reasons why trezor is better than ledger though since I can't find anything from searching online.
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:18:33
That may be true but they released a version of the wallet without doing thorough testing and had potentially been warned about. It's incompetence.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:42:12
I agree with your sentiment. I don't expect any recourse from the dev team. I'm saying that its a bit of a scandal (and yes a bit of frustration venting). People should be aware that a huge error was made, being the most popular wallet doesn't make it the most trustworthy and that the problem is on-going and potentially not fully fixable.
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:58:53
Yea I get it, the point of my post is about trust and warning other not to.
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:19:55
Thank you for your constructive comment. FYI the ledger I got was free.
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:58:32
And also this is a flaw we're now aware of, but there may be other flaws in the future. If the team didn't have the foresight for this one then they likely don't have the foresight for future flaws.
