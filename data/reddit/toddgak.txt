All the powerful people know that crypto currency is the key to the future, they just don't want it to be bitcoin. 
They want it to be something that they make and control. The whole idea of private blockchains shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the value proposition. Maybe some of them know this so a part of the mainstream narrative has been to convince the public of their wishful thinking.

I think the security challenges of keeping a node online with shit tons of BTC in what is effectively a 'hot wallet' will be a deterrent enough for centralization. 
Everybody's risk tolerance is different, but what company\individual is going to be dumb enough to store several million worth of BTC in a hot wallet?
I'm not saying this as criticism against Lightning, I think it's an amazing innovation for smaller payments which is the first step to real merchant adoption. A lightning payment is still far better than a 0-conf.

Make sure you try on testnet first!
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:47:36
This is false. You'll see that blockchain fees on test net are still around 50,000 satoshis. It even costs 18,000 satoshis for single TX on bcash. 
A lightening transaction is instant and has fees of like 1 satoshi or even less sometimes. 
Just let that sink in. Lightening network is 18,000 times CHEAPER than bcash, the forked coin whose whole purpose was cheaper fees and faster transactions.

It'd also be great if we didn't have to buy miners from Buttmain.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:20:26
The source for lightning network fees is from testnet, I don't think mainnet fees are going to be that much different. 
The source for BCH fees are [here](
I personally think it's retarded to equate the fees in USD rather than satoshis. The fees are paid in satoshis NOT USD. Average fee on BCH is about 10k - 20k satoshis. [Median fee on bitcoin]( (the spread is huge), is around 106,000 satoshis.

Well at least someone is trying something, what have you done?
The great thing about layer 2 protocols is that we can have many of them competing with each other and if one fails it doesn't destroy the base layer.

@_date: 2018-01-19 02:35:31
Yeah there are definitely some concerns. The flip side of your scenario is if someone spends down their balance within the channel and then tries to close it out with the original sig. They wouldn't have much to lose because they've already spent their balance. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:53:01

Well he's not entirely wrong. Do you trust your spv wallet or exchange like a pleb?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:47:17
Closing a channel will usually be unnecessary. The cost to access massive amounts of free and instant transactions will be no more than sending a TX to a wallet.
Once all these small TXs are off chain the blockchain fee will also decrease!
Edit: A bunch of people have said that closing a channel is necessary if LN isn't fully adopted. I still don't get that argument. Why not just leave your funds in the channel until you empty the channel? I suppose if you need to use your BTC for some other purpose that didn't accept Lightning, you'd have to close but then why fund the channel with so much BTC in the first place?
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:48:21
Not really. In your example BFX would be a market maker and is providing liquidity to the market. The customer *wants* USDT, why the hell else would they sell BTC on BFX?
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:13:21
Different token bro. In your example if USD is layer two then it should have been gold itself, which we both know is impossible. 
The lightning protocol still uses the SAME BTC as the base layer, the scarcity of the coin itself is not affected.

Bitcoin was great before everyone started using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:32:24
Increasing blocksize solves all our problems by accelerating an 89 Pinto to 30,000mph. It all looks great until the wheels falls off and the chassis melts.
The difference between scaling ideolgy is a risk proposition. Do we wish to face the scaling risk now when Bitcoin is young enough and agile enough to adapt? Or do we want until we have 8x or 100x more users before we deal with this same problem?
The blocksize is a coefficient of technical debt. Just like raising the debt ceiling, it seems like a no brainer of low hanging fruit until you multiply the consequences later on and realize how much needs to be paid back.
The controversy has arisen because the people who have invested in building businesses on top of Bitcoin have relied on low fees to be profitable. These people are the most vocal because they have the most to lose; just like government employees saying that raising the debt ceiling is preferable to losing their job. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:44:05
Are you talking about bitcoin or bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:10:26
That's not the question though. 
For instance imagine this typical future scenario:
I want to share some bitcoin with someone I've met IRL. They don't have ANY bitcoin. I tell them to download the lightening wallet on the appstore. Can I send them a lightening payment?
The crux of this is if it requires you to have bitcoin before you can receive bitcoin it makes it extraordinarily difficult to onboard new people. If your lightening wallet provider is simply a custodial wallet (fronting the cost of the initial payment channel), then we're right back at square one with the dumb banks.

They look beautiful that's for sure. It's guys like that that made Bitcoin what it is today.

Sure they *can*, but *will* they with no incentive? 
Think about the American economy. Is it easier to raise the debt ceiling or cut the budget and make government more efficient? 
Nobody cares about scaling properly when transactions cost $0.01. The temptation to increase the blocksize is the same as the temptation to raise the debt ceiling. 
Short-term solutions are a tragedy of the commons.

You asked if I was afraid of BTC losing value or if I wanted speed or efficiency. 
If I didn't make it clear here it is: BTC's value in the short term is going to take a beating unless hodlers have long term patience. In the short term, other altcoins are going to scale the easy way and it will look like the right choice because everything will work great... for a while. Eventually when a large part of the bitcoin economy jumps ship to something more functional it will reveal the real dirty truth most of us oldtimers already know, crypto doesn't scale. At least not yet. When and if bitcoin figures it out others will follow. 
So I'm not afraid of BTC losing imaginary fiat value. I'm on board for the long haul.

As someone who has had this exact same experience almost exactly 4 years ago I can tell you that the people who are jealous now at your unrealized gains will be the ones to be very smug after the 'big correction'. You will feel shame because they will convince you it was all a delusion. 
Then when you spend even more money to buy bitcoin at $200... err I mean $2000, you will question your own sanity. You will think to yourself, why the fuck do I believe in this shit? Everybody else has left the space, there are no more moon memes. The media says bitcoin is dead and there is no excitement left. Bitcoin becomes boring. You close the charts. You forget about bitcoin for a while, maybe occasionally read the odd article on some new boring technical feature. 
A year or two later suddenly people are asking about bitcoin again. The hype starts building back and price starts rising again. Eventually the price gets back to pre-crash levels and every ounce your being wants to sell. You remember what it was like to see that amount of gains. You hesitate because you are a true hodler and know your wealth can't be measured in dirty fiat. Then right near the previous ATH that took almost 3 years to get back to there is a massive dip. You're panicking. All those smug assholes who told you it was a delusion come flooding back to your consciousness playing on repeat. Fuck those assholes you tell yourself, I didn't hodl this long for chump change. The price blows through the 3 year ATH and heads toward the moon, crashing occasionally to test your resolve. 
Eventually you see a flood of noobs at the same place you were 4 years ago and smile to yourself. You wish you could communicate the power of these emotions but they must experience it for themselves. Many of these noobs will lose everything but the true hodler is forged by fire; to the true hodler goes the reward.

Scaling Bitcoin properly is the key. Utility is something we want, however the misleading part is that bcash or on chain scaling works better *right now*. 
The cryptokitties experiment on Ethereum shows how little *any* crypto scales at this point. Big daddy bitcoin is forced to be the adult and deal with the hard problems, after which we have suffered marketshare of utility they will probably try to copy and paste the improvements on to their own chains like they always do. This won't always work for them though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:24:55
Yeah in the short term bcash will appear superior because of increased functionality. 
If you have a short term vision and want to keep kicking consequences down the road for future developers to solve then bcash is a great scaling solution. 
Blocksize is a coefficient of technical debt. It's a powerfull tool for scaling but it has consequences. We want bitcoin to last 100+ years not 10.

Thanks for the links. I obviously need to a lot more reading on this, I've been waiting for things to settle before I dived into it and now seem the time to get more knowledgeable about lightening. 
However after reading that 3.1.1, it appears that while one party can fund a channel completely, they would be taking on additional risk because the recipient could hold remaining funds hostage. 
I don't believe real life usage of lightening will have people opening channels amongst each other, there seems to be no point for one time transactions. 
Which means people will have upstream lightening providers who have channels with other hubs which have a channel with your desired endpoint. Which also means people who have NO bitcoin at all will need the service of a hub provider to create that initial channel to their wallet so they can receive lightening money. 
This could prove risky if you are opening a one way channel with a customer who could just decide to never close out the channel. Which means banks errr I mean 'LN hubs' will require some sort of ID or collateral before they open a channel for their user.

They way I see it is that the blockchain as an individual network, is grossly inefficient compared to a centralized one. However the global legacy banking system is made up of thousands upon thousands of disparate networks.
To consolidate all these disparate networks into a single network would be greatly more efficient than the blockchain but it would require the trust and mandate from every country on earth, good luck with that.

We'll see how long you can hold out when you start to get hungry. But even if you could buy more food tomorrow why would you buy more than you *need* when you could buy more with your money the day after that?
This is my point; when we consume only what we *need* then there are more resources for everyone. There are a finite amount of resources on this planet, why not have a currency system that reflects that?
An inflationary system requires constant expansion or it collapses, which means it can only consume more, never less. If you think mass consumerism and unnecessary consumption is a good thing, then inflationary economics makes a ton of sense.

This is why blockchain.info now has a proper .onion address with an SSL cert for those few that have to use TOR to access their bitcoin wallets.

Think of your bitcoin as gold. If you bought gold where would you have stored it? You decided to leave your gold under the care of some fat kid in Tokyo who has a history of egotistical arrogance and business incompetence. This guy has bounced from fiasco to fiasco ALWAYS blaming others for the short comings of his company.
Buying coins on Gox wouldn't have been a big deal if you hadn't left them there. I'm sorry if this seems harsh but this early stage of bitcoin is about taking control of our money and taking responsibility for how we manage it. There is a reason bitcoin won't be mainstream for many years yet, and this is why; nobody will bail you out when you make bad choices. 
People have become accustomed to getting their bank accounts hacked or their credit cards stolen and these institutions will always cover the loss. It doesn't work like that in bitcoin, at least not yet. If it ever does there will be a substantial cost for that service. Bitcoin doesn't compete with fiat feature for feature, there are things fiat does better. If those protectionist features of a government insured fiat appeal to you then keep using it, maybe wait until bitcoin catches up with those specific aspects you feel are missing.

Amen brother. Regulation is a bandaid for a flawed system. Bitcoin is an opportunity to make a system that isn't flawed,  because we have the power to deal with problems programmatically. Bitcoin isn't perfect yet, probably never will be, but we are solving problems without regulation.
Regulation is a means of last resort, to provide legitimacy to system that would fuck you in the ass if left to its own devices.

I apologise in advance if these are dumb questions:
Do you think this will increase confirmation times or 1st confirmation times? 
Is the missing block data algorithmically reconstructed or does it have to be download from a node that already has it?
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:22:21
I don't think would work that way at all. The entire network capacity would be divided into blocks (like a torrent), those blocks would then be distributed across the network and across devices. These blocks would be highly redundant. When you upload data it isn't to some specific computer but rather the network as a whole. Pieces of your file could be on a thousand devices. Think of the data as layer on top of the storage network. The central authority in this scenario would be the blockchain, which keeps everyone honest in the same way it keeps bitcoin honest. You can't dupe the system anymore than you could create fake bitcoins.
Maybe this will help you understand. When you are using bittorrent to download something you are getting pieces of a file from many sources. It doesn't matter where these pieces come from, because they are all verified based on the hash of torrent itself. With a healthy torrent it doesn't matter if even a few seeds disappear because copies exist within the torrent network. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:49:12
In these types of situations it's difficult to explain the nuances of the entire scenario (you only have a few seconds), you have to be strategic in how you try to correct misinformation. 
Like Andreas said when the lady brought up hackers making more bitcoins, explaining how mining worked would have been the correct answer but just saying proof through computation was correct way to go because of the time constraints.
This is a problem for bitcoin because it is inherently quite complicated and if most people can't figure out how it works in less than 30 seconds they are instantly afraid of it.

I think it's a great idea but it would be wise to do as many things 'on the chain' as possible. There are still a lot of points where you have to trust these new unproven individuals who will be running it.

For all the stupid suggested reasons in this thread I think it's very simple and not sinister at all. Look at their business model it's based on SUBSCRIPTIONS and automated billing. Something that bitcoin doesn't really do. Micropayments aren't technically where they make their money.
They offer a $1.00 for 2 day membership with some fine print that read "*Trial membership rebills at US $39.95 per month until cancelled."
That's $10 fucking more dollars than just paying the monthly rate up front. So it's blatantly obvious stupid people just get the $1.00 trial and forget about it and end up with the $40 bill on the third day. Bitcoin doesn't allow them this feature.

Gold was a lot more stable than the historical revisionists would have you believe. Purchasing power of the dollar stayed pretty much the same all the way up to the great depression. The gold standard was a convenient scapegoat and its abolition was used to create absolute control over the economy. 
You could argue that economic stability is gained by having central banking, but I could also argue that government efficiency is increased with a dictatorship. Sometimes a little instability and lack of efficiency is required to keep a fair system that can't be manipulated.

In terms of inequality I don't think it makes much of difference either way. 
In an inflationary system the rich people entrench themselves around the faucets (government subsidies, tax evasion, central banking) and eliminate the means for that money ever reaching the poor. The stock market soaks up QE like a sponge and then throws a tantrum when Bernanke tries to turn off the faucet. An inflationary system is like a treadmill that keeps everybody running, the central bank can speed up and slow down the speed while we're all just running to keep up. We are slaves to this silly machine because if we stop running we'll get thrown off and left behind.
In a deflationary system the rich will take less risks, but that also means more long term stability for economy in general. Where each deflationary unit represents a share of the finite amount of resources on the planet, value is created by labour. With digital currency the rich can horde all they want because the means of transaction are infinitely divisible, and we'll just switch from millibits to microbits to satoshis.
Eventually people consume less, work less and enjoy life more. We become a modest society that values time with friends and family over working 12 hours days so we can buy inflatable BBQs with MP3 players.

Then towards end goes on to empathize how its only utility is payment processing. I still don't get why all these big players keep parroting that...

If you want to cash out to fiat there has to be someone on the other end that wants the bitcoin.

Fuck wallstreet money and government regulation, I want to see innovation like this open people's minds to what is possible.

I'm guessing he's referring to a situation where a well funded mining operation happens to develop a shit ton of superior ASICs. Their costs per hashpower may be vastly lower than the competition. So instead of selling a few coins at market rate, they create massive sell walls at a low price with the intention of making mining too expensive for their competition. When the competition turns off their miners because it can't cover the costs the hashing difficulty plummets and the well funded mining operation fills the gaps with their new ASICs grabbing a large stake of the pie.
It would be an interesting gamble that could really backfire. For instance if the market gobbles the wall then they just sold a fuck ton of coins below market price.

There are ways to control your private keys while giving up responsibility for maintaining the integrity of those keys. This increases the security and usability simultaneously. Blockchain.info is an excellent example of how you can store an encrypted copy of your keys with them and they provide the infrastrucuture to access your money from anywhere. Blockchain.info does not have access to your private keys.
The only requirement is that you can remember a password.

That still wouldn't work because the checksums would be based on quantity of data. It doesn't matter who gives the checksum, if you are being paid to store 50GB it doesn't matter where that 50GB is. Either you are storing the 50GB or you are not. Those 100 zombies still have to retrieve a valid checksum from a device that is actually storing the data. You're not getting paid by device, you're getting paid per byte.
A botnet is still a problem in the sense you could steal people's hard drive space. People are already using botnets to steal CPU for mining so it isn't much different.

It is disingenuous to suggest that Andreas had malicious intent regarding Neo &amp; Bee... Danny fucked over everyone who was involved without warning. It was a business with large prospects and it seemed well executed. You can't blame Andreas for falling for the same shit a lot of other people did. 
Here's an idea, think for yourself and if you take risky investment advice from anyone don't try to hold them accountable for your own actions. Andreas didn't force you to buy Neo &amp; Bee, as far as I know there isn't even a single instance where he told anyone to even buy it. It is time to let it go man.

People misunderstand how sales tax works. As a merchant I remit sales tax collected - the sales tax spent. If I paid sales tax on my supply I would want to collect tax on the sale so I don't have to pay it. 
The part that differs is when I sell services, like fixing your computer. The government wants a sales cut of that as well, so if I have to pay it you damn well better believe I'm gonna collect it.

There is no way to manipulate supply without giving up control to a small group of people. You can chose services which do so but that should always be optional. 
Theoretically a government or large entity could hold bitcoin in its finite supply and release liquidity or buy back based on current economic conditions, this is what they did back in the days of gold by holding reserves. Of course this is still not as convenient as being able to endlessly print currency to fund war etc...

I used to care more about this distinction. 
Truth is bitcoin is actually more virtual than digital. If you have 3 bitcoin you don't have a digital representation of it, it doesn't actually exist anywhere, even as ones and zeros. What you do have is proof that an output was sent to your public address. You don't store the coins themselves but rather the keys to make a transaction which makes the actual bitcoin virtual. The blockchain ledger is digital, but a ledger is not a currency.
EDIT: Reminds me of the oilsand vs. tar-sand debate in Alberta. In technicality it really is oilsands because it is made of oil and sand. Tar is something completely different than oil but bitchumen really looks like tar. Plus tar sounds dirtier than oil for some reason so it's useful politically. I've always noticed that environmentalists say tar-sands and oil executives always say oilsands.

I don't know why you're getting down voted because you're right. The overall bitcoin market is relatively small, and it is easy to saturate. There are only so many people who hold btc, live in the states and also need computer parts. They jump on the opportunity when a big player like tiger direct comes on board but sales drop dramatically because there were only so many potential sales to begin with. 
Over time they will see a slow increase in BTC sales as potential sales increase. People like myself can't buy on tiger direct because I live in Canada.

No. Your ISP/IP address is only one reveal vector. If you bought BTC on an exchange than your personal information is tied to the BTC you sent to your own private address. 
If you used those coins anywhere else they can also work backwards through the blockchain until they find the exchange and then get your info that way. 
Even if you use a separate address for every transaction they can tie the addresses together until they find one that has an identity attached to it. 
Even if you bought your BTC from localbitcoins.com they could shake down the guy who sold them to you, and use security cameras etc. 
Really there TONS of vectors that will reveal your identity. You're right in that there are mitigation measures such as TOR and mixing services, perhaps mining the coins yourself etc... but if you think bitcoin is fully anonymous you are delusional.

Well I think the point is to get people comfortable enough to use it and then worry about the proper secure methods later. People are unlikely to use something if they are frightened by it, and why wouldn't be when there are computer professionals here (that should know better) losing their bitcoins to hackers on a regular basis. 
This is why I think dogecoin serves a unique purpose. The value is low, so you can send large amounts of it around, the community is non-threatening and generous, and the process of using dogecoin is virtually the same as bitcoin. I think altcoins are an excellent training ground. 
Currently we can't play around with small amounts of BTC in the same way because the transaction fees are too large.

I think we spend our bitcoins when value goes up (I know I do too) because we're worried the value is going to go down. I spend less when the value is down because I know the value will go up. Volatility creates boom\bust cycles.
Your consumer electronics are analogy is good because it proves people will still buy things when they know a better one will come out tomorrow, mainly because we want it now. Same thing with deflationary currency, you'll still buy things because you don't want to wait. Everyone has their threshold.

Merchant adoption is a pretty terrible reason to buy bitcoins. And while I don't think these merchants are damaging to bitcoin I also don't think they provide too much either.

First off I would say do a lot of reading. If you're someone who doesn't already own a smartphone then you have a lot of reading to do. If you have specific questions you can PM me and I'll try to answer them the best I can. The second thing is don't invest more than you can afford to use. Even though Bitcoin is amazing and its potential is amazing, it's also still early days and there is a possibility you can lose your coins.
To answer your questions:
1. One of the easiest ways to do transactions with bitcoin is with an online wallet. I recommend [blockchain.info]( because they don't have access to your private keys and can't steal your bitcoins. You can spend/access your coins directly from the website or use an app on your Android smartphone. They are working on getting a browser version that works properly for iPhone. 
1. "Couldn't anyone just create their own cryptocurrency?" Yes. Infact there are tons of [alternative cryptocurrencies]( Bitcoin is open source so people can make a competing one if they so like. This DOES NOT mean people can forge bitcoins. Bitcoins are created through a very specific mathematical process and nobody can just make them out of thin air. 
1. Bitcoin is not illegal in Canada. Canada has one of the freest policies when it comes to bitcoins. However certain banks will not do business with certain exchanges due to their own obligations of regulation. The biggest exchange in Canada is cavirtex.com, they are also the most expensive exchange. If you are with RBC you can open up an account in an RBC US branch and then use coinbase.

How did you import the address of your new 'safer wallet' into blockchain.info? Did you import the public key as watch only? Did you manually type this address out from a paper wallet? 
The ddos only affects the website of blockchain.info it can not affect your bitcoins in anyway.
P.S. If you did sent it to the wrong address you will never get your coins back. It might be a good idea though to find out how that happened. Also if there is currently a problem with blockchain.info's website, it would be best to wait until all the information is available.

An example of how inbred this thinking is:
I was taking care of my girlfriend's kids as we walked through a forest park when we came upon a creek. This creek was dirty and disgusting and yet they still wanted to play in it. I told them there was no way to know if it was safe and they replied, "If it wasn't safe there would be a sign!". So I asked them if it was the government's responsibility to keep them safe and they said yes. No critical thinking is required before jumping into a toxic looking creek because fuck yeah government.
Which also reminds me of the controversy in my area over banning tanning beds for people under the age of 18. The kids believe that as long as it isn't illegal it is safe.

Compartmentalized risk is different than systemic risk. With bitcoin if a user gets compromised that user alone loses his money. If a bank goes under then all the deposits go with it. Traditionally when this happens the government bails them out with everyone's money. That bailout money has to come from somewhere and ends up being a tax on society.
Do you believe we should socialize loss? Who's losses should come out of the general kitty? Tragedy of the commons in this case are people who are careless, getting their bank accounts or credit cards stolen and not having any consequences. They think that some magical money fairy just replaces the stolen money and to them they have recovered their loss.

When you have the imagination to comprehend what is possible with bitcoin it's hard not to be seduced by it.
I think the harsh reality is that bitcoin's potential or whether or not it succeeds are two separate things. 
Personally like the OP I'm willing to go down with the ship simply for the privilege being apart of humanity's last ditch effort at a free, equitable and inclusive financial system.

Traceability and anonymity are different things. You can trace transactions through the blockchain without knowing the identities of the addresses, so yes I still think bitcoin is fully traceable. 
As for anonymity, even if you could find an exchange that would let you fund fiat without personal information (which one is that btw?) you would still have your identity attached to that fiat transfer which could be linked to BTC you buy on that exchange.  
Buying from someone on localbitcoins without meeting them still leaves a fiat trail to that person, and then where did THAT person get the BTC from? Maybe the person you're buying BTC from, bought it on an exchange with his personal info. Then all they need to do is trace the BTC back to him work forward and find the fiat transfer to him for your purchase...
All I'm trying to say is that to be anonymous you have to successfully sever the identity link between BTC transfers, which is very hard to do. For instance maybe you leave bag of CASH in the forest and then sell the GPS coordinates to that bag of cash in exchange for BTC in which you arranged over TOR. Then you have to be careful to only ever send coins from that address over TOR and only to places that have no link to your real identity. There are other ways that are theoretically possible, none of them are particularly practical.

But the chicken and egg problem makes using exchanges mandatory. This in addition to centralized mining introduces the same systemic risks that bitcoin was supposed to get rid of. You only overcome that by using bitcoin and being paid in bitcoin but even then you are subject to volatility that makes it impractical. Volatility would be less of an issue if more people used it as a currency but again chicken and egg.

Because I can securely trade assets with people OTHER THAN the issuer. The blockchain insures that the assets being traded are not counterfeit. The blockchain also allows these assets to be traded without a central party to verify the authenticity of the issued asset. 
This allows for programmable platforms to dynamically allocate additional functionality to the asset holders, to allow for trustless exchange etc... The possibilities are incredible. From creating non counterfeitable coupons for my business that people can trade electronically. To creating tickets for events. To creating shares for shared assets like a timeshare condo...

I think it's tough for us when emotions get involved. I'm passionate about Bitcoin because of its incredible potential for powerful change on this planet. I'm sure there are a lot of people who would see me as some sort of zealot.
Even though Bitcoin is for everyone, I don't think we need to appeal to everyone. There are some people who are closed minded and will never give bitcoin a chance, there are others who are more open and curious. If someone saw a guy shooting his iPhone on TV a curious person would ask, "what would motivate someone to do that?" maybe they discover Bitcoin because of that. A closed minded person is just going to reconfirm what they already believe anyways.

They only do $25 transactions for gross profit of $6.25 per transaction. Take another dollar for processing fees you have $5.25 left. Each chargeback has a $25 fee plus the amount of the transaction, so $50. 
In other words they need to do 9.5 legit transactions for every charge back just to break even.

Not quite. The act of laundering is a method of legitimizing money that was obtained through an illegal process. The only way to be 100% sure money has not been laundered is to have ID of every money source. The problem is that this is unrelated to the actual crime and just attempts to make it more difficult for people to benefit from crime. Ergo money laundering laws require ALL of us to give up privacy while at the same time providing no benefit to stopping actual crime.

Well then maybe this is why. There is nothing wrong with teaching people about Bitcoin and having a vested interest in its success. I think just about everyone here wants Bitcoin to succeed and getting major retailers to accept it is one way to increase awareness. 
I don't think anyone wants to "preserve an illusion", Bitcoin will be mainstream when it's damn good and ready. Anything we can do to help it along is welcome. As an adopter, investor and believer I won't be ashamed to promote my vested interest. The ways Bitcoin can affect this world is far greater than my meagre BTC holdings, or the amount I would benefit from a price increase. 
Major retailers coming online are fulfilling pent up demand and potential sales that have been waiting for the opportunity. Of course there will be a big spike and immediate fall off. Benefiting from the attention is good for the retailer and good for Bitcoin.

Ripple is an odd animal to wrap a head around, it has a lot of moving parts but is also one of the only altcoins fundamentally different from bitcoin. You are right that all of it is pre-mined and they will use it as a centralized currency. I think they are also focusing on using ripple as currency conversion medium using a web of trust as a decentralized exchange of sorts. The problems that I see is that it isn't all that decentralized, and counterparty risks are offloaded onto individuals rather than those are benefiting from the transactions. The incentive structure for participation is simply wrong, but time will tell whether they can do something useful with it. 
I currently still see it as a 'scamcoin' of sorts until they can prove its usefulness.

I disagree. There is a phenomenal amount of effort and investment required in creating the infrastructure supporting a cryptocoin. Sure anyone can make an altcoin, but that altcoin won't instantly have:
* Custom ASICs to secure the network.
* A network hashrate which can be trusted.
* Payment processors and exchanges.
* Larger existing liquidity pool for bigger trades.
* Retail merchants that accept it.
* Custom hardware like wallets and POS devices.
* Layered dependent services like Namecoin or Counterparty etc...
When you look at the risks to jumping to some other scamcoin you realize that half of them are premined, are being pumped and dumped, aren't accepted anywhere, have no infrastructure like online web wallets etc... And most importantly **provide no additional technological advantages over bitcoin**.
In order for people to switch from bitcoin to an altcoin at this point there has to be some really big reasons to do so. AND EVEN if the time came where this was necessary, there are ways to transition without destroying the value of bitcoin. For instance proof of burn is an excellent way to exit bitcoin for another coin without affecting the value of bitcoin.

Regardless of whether or not emptygox was actually affected by transaction malleability, it is a useful example to explain that bitcoin isn't perfect. It is an even better example to explain that there are tons of hurdles affecting the scalability of the protocol and making it robust enough to withstand malicious attacks. 
Hearn also makes the important point that there is virtually nobody working on the protocol in comparison to the monetary value of the network. Really Gavin is the bitcoin. He's the only one who is really smart enough to solve the big problems. There are few other supporting characters but are we really expecting the future of a global financial network to rest on the shoulders of 5 guys who are barely getting paid?
What happens if Gavin is hit by a bus? What happens when the Bitcoin Foundation dries up and can't pay him anymore? There doesn't seem to be enough financial incentive for talented people to contribute to core development. The ones who are, like Hearn, are doing it because they are passionate about bitcoin and its potential but that only goes so far.
I will say that Bitpay is definitely contributing to protocol development and I wish Coinbase would do more of the same. The biggest players who are making the most *should* altruistically give more. In a long term perspective how do we solve the problem of getting quality developers for the core development? The Bitcoin Foundation was an attempt at this, but we all know it just became a lightning rod for corruption and misrepresentation.

There is group of people now getting involved in something called a "De-Growth Movement". It's the idea what we can not expand the economy indefinitely and that we need to slow down economic production for our health and the health of the planet.
This idea that everyone is entitled to a house or property when they turn 18 is ridiculous. The idea is also very American and not seen as much throughout the world. 
For instance in South Korea they have a system where you live with your parents until you can save up a hundred grand just to RENT an apartment. You give your hundred grand to the landlord that holds it in trust, it is insured by the government. Then you are entitled to live in the apartment RENT FREE as your landlord makes interest off your deposit. It's quite an interesting system.
This is a very interesting discussion and shows how different competing ideas of lifestyle and entitlement are reflected in our economic systems and monetary policies. Ultimately I believe our current systems are unsustainable.

I think this is an important distinction... A p2p exchange is not a high frequency price discovery environment like Bitstamp.

I think it is always wise to include the 'kinda anonymous' caveat. There are extraordinary measures that can be taken to maintain anonymity and even then 3 letter agencies could probably still trace it. 
The problem isn't with you attaching personal info to an address, it's everyone else. You just need a few crumbs of identity to reveal identities of the next and so on. People need to be reminded that bitcoin isn't truly anonymous.

I hope I'm not too late I worked at Gox and I can tell you what happened!
A year or so ago we were having a staff meeting and someone suggested we should store the customers BTC deposit in a cold storage address. So Mark fired up his laptop and generated the keys offline. He then wrote them down on a napkin he had next to the computer. After some difficulties connecting to the Starbucks WiFi he was finally able to log on to the Bitcoin wallet and transfer the 744,000BTC to the napkin address... It probably wasn't even 12 seconds later Mark accidentally spilled his frappuccino all over his computer and the napkin with the private key! It didn't take long before all the sugar in the whip cream smudged the ink beyond recognition. We all swore an oath never to speak of this, and Mark has been running fractional reserve ever since.

I think you missed by point... a feature of BTC is that it doesn't need conversion to fiat AT ALL. If a future could be envisioned where my employer gets paid in BTC and then pays me in BTC and then I make my purchases in BTC, then what need for fiat would there actually be?
There are ways to 'inject' value into the bitcoin ecosystem without fiat ever being involved. If I give my labour for BTC compensation, that value stays in the ecosystem until I cash it out for fiat. If I pass that value on to someone else it still stays in the system until someone cashes it out. 
Currently when you buy BTC on an exchange for fiat someone else is selling BTC for fiat so the value effect is neutral, (I'm putting value in, someone is taking it out). All it takes is for a farmer to sell his grain to a baker for BTC who then uses that BTC to buy bread from the baker to feed his family. No fiat involved.

Innovation at the edges, a system of allowing access instead of denying it. 
The old banking system is closed and based on explicit trust, any bank not in their club is denied a seat at the party. It's pretty much just an elaborate system of IOUs where actual settlement of debts is done long after transfers have been completed. A system of many human checks and balances, susceptible to corruption and manipulation (AKA Libor). 
So yeah, there might be use for a blockchain in the banking system.

Yes and No. The old legacy money system works on checks and balances, there are lots humans involved who sign off on large money transfers etc... With bitcoin all you need is a few characters of information and you can take the money permanently. There is no undo button with bitcoin so the stakes are much higher... exposing those few bytes of a private key is all it takes for a hacker to clean you out. The old system, being based on denying access and explicit trust doesn't have this problem. They can simply reverse or undo bad transactions as they are found. As you can imagine, this isn't very efficient.
Humans are odd in the sense we only evolve when it is absolutely necessary. Just like nobody gives a shit about climate change until your farm turns into a desert or nobody gives a shit about running out of oil until it's $600 bucks a barrel. When we have to, we can be incredibly resourceful to solve problems. Bitcoin is the kick in the ass needed to force infrastructure to be created that solves information security problems. This will have far reaching impacts that will trickle down to all aspects of IT security and it is a benefit to everyone.
Like Andreas says, we've only been doing information security for a tiny fraction of our species' existence and we really suck at it.

For first time users mycelium is vastly superior. You download the app and boom you're done. You don't need to sign up, you can receive bitcoin in seconds. 
The backup option creates mnemonic seed words for the deterministic wallet, you just write down some words and you have a backup. You can set a pin for additional security. The local trader is built into the app. The interface is slick and very easy to use.
The only thing blockchain is better for is use on multiple devices. It is much more cumbersome to setup properly.

Even though AES is very secure, it is also extremely efficient. This can be good when you're doing something like encrypting web traffic and trying to reduce overhead; but this can be bad when trying to protect a wallet or file from brute force.

History is full of examples of visionaries with tremendous ideas being shit on by people because they were trying something different. I'm sure there is some evolutionary reason for this massive counterbalance. 
When Noah built his ark they ridiculed him for building a massive boat in the middle of nowhere. It didn't matter if it was an awesome fucking boat, it didn't make sense to them and they felt the need to lash out. It didn't even affect them because how does some guy building a boat by himself in the middle of nowhere have anything to do with anyone else? It was just weird, different and a little scary. Scary because maybe if some guy would dedicate his entire life to something he believed in, there was a little more to it. Needless to say when the rains came they all wanted aboard Noah's awesome boat, but alas the door was already closed. They all drowned muttering something about fairy tails and deflationary economics.

What I think he is trying to say is that financial auditing is not dependent upon the identity of the source. If you as a business receive $100 in cash, it doesn't matter who gives it to you. What does matter is having a record that you received $100, so it can be taxed. 
Anonymity doesn't affect financial auditing for tax purposes, it does however make money laundering more feasible. If you opened up a tanning salon you could funnel your dirty cash in as fake customers and the tax man doesn't know the difference.

Bitcoin is certainly traceable because every transaction is verified and recorded PERMANENTLY in the blockchain. This means every bitcoin transaction of all time can be traced back to its origins. 
As for anonymity, bitcoin is only anonymous up to the point where you can associate a person with a public address. After that, you can TRACE the transactions to other addresses and associate more identities to more addresses. 
The reality is when you have the power of the NSA bitcoin is not anonymous at all!

This is the best reply here. Everything works in tandem with perceived bitcoin value. Every bubble has sent tech talent running into startups to create that necessary infrastructure. We need both. More adoption means more incentive to create infrastructure.

This behavior is a demonstration of how much we value Bitcoin and the ability to use it freely on the computing devices we've paid for.

Bitcoin is simply a financial protocol and all financial ERP software or point of sale is going to keep track of the details AKA bitcoin wallets. 
Not declaring income is tax evasion period. Even in the current system, you can have multiple bank accounts in different names, overseas etc. You could stash cash in an onsite or offsite safe etc.
I guess the conclusion is that currently bitcoin isn't anonymous and it doesn't correlate proof of transactions with a specific identity, so it is broken in two ways. Both of these things are being worked on. I think people get the two confused. I believe one of the ways proposed is that transactions begin with a signed request for funds. You could then use those signed requests as receipts for auditing. It is also useful in dispute management when I can prove I sent bitcoins to you personally if you claimed I sent it to some random bitcoin address. 
TL;DR Bitcoin needs both anonymity and proof that funds were sent to a specific entity. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:26:54
I'm assuming it would be based on checksums of storage data per device so if your device could not produce the required checksums it would be removed from the network. The network knows what SHOULD be there, unless you can produce a fake hash (which you can't) you won't be able to lie.
Also I doubt you would be paid "up front" for you storage. You must likely would be paid for every checksum check done on your storage device. Maybe they do these checks like 24 times a day or something, with little micropayments. 
I have no idea if this is how it works, I'm just throwing out ideas.

So really it would be about how many blocks you wanted. If I was only bidding on a few blocks, I'd bid far below market price. Then again if there is some big whale wanting the whole lot they might bid fairly close to market price. Either way I doubt we'll see bids higher than market price.

One of the reasons he is so powerfully alluring is because he allows his passion to dictate his speech. I wouldn't want him to have to self-censor to appease a wider audience. As much as I'd love to see him on the foundation board, he might be more influential behind the scenes where he can say whatever he wants.

Bitcoin is a technology first and currency is only a feature. There are many features to bitcoin, so in that way it is somewhat a stock. Bitcoin doesn't need to make profit because it is a medium of exchange based on mathematically controlled scarcity. Adoption increases scarcity and increases price of the currency feature. 
If you believe in the bitcoin technology and all other features of which it is comprised, you might also believe in increased adoption. If you don't think bitcoin will ever be adopted as a medium of exchange (like yourself), you should not buy any bitcoin.

Even if bitcoin doesn't succeed you can't argue it hasn't done amazing things in progressing IT security.
There is now a direct financial incentive for hackers and those who wish to defend against them. Technological solutions are being made to solve security problems when before bitcoin the trend was to just to deny the problems existed to begin with.

Every month we have the "end of bitcoin", I think bitcoin has died at least 5 times in the last year.
My trust isn't lost, because I'm not a sheep nor an idiot. I've done my own research and know the protocol is solid. No bitcoins were magically lost. My bitcoins are safe because I had the foresight to avoid using an exchange that exhibited tell tale signs of being incompetent. 
In the future I'd like to see maybe some sort of "opt in regulation" where exchanges could follow a procedure to be certified and insured by a governing body of some sorts. People could decide for themselves if it was worth using an exchange that was certified\insured or if they want to take their chances on one that wasn't.

People need to stop caring about this. I also prefer digital currency but in the most pedantic way virtual is more correct. 
Virtual currency is more pedantically correct because there is no such thing as a digital token or unit of account that holds value. What we do have is a ledger that tracks inputs and outputs. These inputs and outputs are added/subtracted by your client to display a 'virtual' total. This total is the sum of all unspent outputs. When you make a bitcoin transaction you use the whole output and and make change to another address. So yes, your balance is a virtual total derived from a digital ledger.

There are a lot of people that are happy when the bank gives them their money back after they've been 'hacked'. This is almost always the fault of the customer and yet they get their money back.
This money has come from somewhere to compensate the victims. It is just another way we socialise loss to eliminate risk. We basically steal value from everyone to give this moron his money back.
For this reason bitcoin will appeal to a large group, maybe not everybody, but those who value the importance of individual responsibility. There is no "too big to fail" in bitcoin; we take store of value seriously and we take risk seriously, if not it is at our own peril.

Ultimately any technology requires resources. You can make technology more efficient but it still needs resources.
Resources on planet earth are finite. There is only so much stuff. I think we will need an inflationary currency to represent energy and a deflationary currency to represent mass. Either way mass consumerism and unsustainable endless growth are reflected in the economic system we have. A deflationary economic system moves much slower and promotes the absolute efficiency and recycling of resources. If anyone was worried about climate change then bitcoin is also the solution to that as well.

I think his main point was that it is more about who controls the monetary supply. You have absolute power when you control the ability to manipulate currency supply. Whether you are benevolent or malevolent is somewhat a matter of luck for the people.
All throughout human history it was common to have kings and queens ruling over men with absolute power. Sometimes they were selflessly loving towards the common man, other times they were tyrants.

First off there is substantial doubt that Ross actually ran the site. He created it originally, and was later roped into some moderation right before he was arrested. The murder for hire allegations were bait and switch as he was never actually charged with them. It was probably done to sway public perception against him. His trial wasn't very fair and it's easy to see that government had pre-determined verdict against him in hope of making an example of him.




These things were only briefly available on silk road at the beginning of its existence but were quickly banned.
As for your argument against extremely addictive drugs, nobody is saying these things are safe. We're talking about harm reduction not harm removal. I believe these drugs should be legal so we can address the abusive of such as a mental health issue not a criminal issue. The silk road provided access to predictable quality while eliminating turf violence and organized crime components of traditional drug crime. 
The silk road didn't suddenly make drugs harmless, it was simply a much lesser evil when compared to the alternatives.

That bitcoin has the *potential* to be a store of value, and therefore be useful in actual transactions completely external to the traditional financial system. 
Critics like to review the product as it stands today, which might be fair, but I think it's naive and shortsighted.
There is this expectation these days that any new technology should be perfect and better in every way from its predecessor. Where in the case of bitcoin, the success of the technology largely depends on its adoption and development. The relevance of its features and extendability largely depend on its overall liquidity.

Sometimes arbitrage works in your favor. I know in Canada, the buy price on CAVIRTEX is usually higher than the 17% currency difference to USD, although sometimes it's lower. 
With bitcoin liquidity being so exceptionally small, there is usually a benefit in doing a remittance to a country that has greater bitcoin demand. This is one of the things that makes bitcoin fascinating in that natural arbitrage is much easier to consolidate on the bitcoin side than it is on the fiat side. You see people holding accounts on many exchanges in different countries moving bitcoin around from exchange to exchange doing almost instant arbitrage, although never withdrawing fiat. It's only half of the equation, where volatility becomes a useful mechanic.

I'm not really disagreeing with you. Bitcoin arbitrage is a very tiny window of opportunity, where fast actors can make easy money. The barrier to entry in this program is minimal, so we see lots of participation by people with small floats. 
All that being said, I think comparing the value proposition of bitcoin in its current state is a bit arduous. Fiat bridging infrastructure is still in its infancy. Bitcoin's true potential value proposition isn't 'making fiat easier to use', it's the amazing properties of programmable money. Bitcoin loses a tremendous amount of utility and function when it has to be converted to fiat and vice versa.

The purpose of the block reward is also seeding the initial currency units to those who are contributing to the system as a whole. There is simply no other fair way to do it. With central banks, new currency is created as debt by a few privileged players who make free money off an interest spread. 
The block reward is also a subsidy for building out bitcoin infrastructure. As this infrastructure gets built the subsidy decreases. It is part of a greater incentive model to make sure people are motivated to participate. 
So to say block rewards are only payment for a few transactions is rather near sighted and a bit disingenuous.

You are right in the sense that there is less economic expansion, and certainly times of economic contraction. This however is a means of discovery to find out what is really needed on this earth. I personally think it would be a good thing to live more modestly and not be as wasteful. 
With climate change and income disparity between rich and poor we are seeing that endless economic expansion is simply unsustainable. And an economic model that is based on endless expansion is actually a lie because eventually you have to pay the debt back. This is debt we owe to the earth itself. If we can't pay the debt, this planet will foreclose on our existence and shake us off like a mild case of the sniffles.

This still doesn't explain why addresses under gox control have NOT moved coins since 2011. 
Show me blockchain proof! If thieves had stole the coins they would have been spread to the wind, not in a small amount of 20k addresses.
The only theories that makes sense to me:
1. Mark lost the private keys.
1. The government has extorted Mark in giving up control of those keys.
1. Mark is planning on stealing those coins himself
Personally I don't think 3 is very plausible because although Mark has proven himself incompetent on many occasions, he doesn't seem to be malicious or else he would have handled this differently. Number 1 is plausible because he's already shown he's in over his head and can make massive mistakes. Also his ego has prevented him from seeking help and might also be preventing him from admitting how much of a colossal fuck up he has made. Number 2 is plausible because of how he has responded in the press and online. How he has been under pressure from the USG already and how he has refused to provide blockchain evidence. How the the timing of this seems to coincide with a larger campaign to discredit bitcoin in the media and paint it as a currency for illegal activity and fraud.

There are probably much better ways than a nation state using mining to destroy bitcoin. Think about the insane cost and logistics to setting up a ASIC datacentre that could gain 51% hash power. After all that they get to do one double spend before we hard fork to a different chain. Who wants to continue to mine on the evil government blockchain?
If I was an authoritarian nation state with seemingly infinite resources I would infiltrate all the bitcoin communities and sow dissent and distrust of developers and contributors. I would get them arguing over simple wedge issues and dramatize, demonize and slander the moderates. I would coopt moderators of large message boards and get them to censor content not beneficial to my cause. Eventually the community would implode and people would lose faith in the technology itself simultaneously stopping development and causing panic as everyone heads for the fiat exits.

It makes it even worse when you base the whole system on code autonomy and then do something dependent on human intervention.
If you are trying to replace lawyers, government, regulations, laws etc, you can't pretend to be them when shit gets fucked up. If your whole project is based on the idea of autonomy then you have to accept the good with the bad because the system is the arbiter.

Bitcoin is one of those things that doesn't care how smart you are. It doesn't care how many degrees you have or if you went to the best university in the world. 
Everyone is on the same playing field. Some people understand bitcoin more than others because they took the time to learn, but that has no correlation to how smart they are.
A 12 year old kid writes down 12 words from a mycelium wallet and his bitcoins are safe forever. A man with 6 PhDs thinks he's too smart to follow instructions and loses all his bitcoins.

I'm not sure if this is right but I think it has something to do with how much botting and high frequency trading exists on these exchanges. The real liquidity is somewhat masked because you could technically just trade the same bitcoin back and forth between yourself. You could fill your own asks and sell into your own bids. And if the same bitcoin is going back and forth between bids and asks it creates the illusion that more trades have taken place. 
There is no way to know if these trades are the same bitcoin owned by the same person. You could still technically do this on a fee exchange but the fee creates a financial disincentive in doing so, kind of like a spam filter.

It's not pegged to the dollar in a literal sense, what I meant is that it is priced in USD. 
For example: When CAD/USD was par the price per BTC was technically the same. So if you bought 100 CAD worth of BTC you had about 100 USD worth of BTC. Fast forward to today that same 100 USD worth of BTC is actually 128 CAD worth of BTC. 
So what I was trying to say is that buying BTC back in 2013 with CAD was actually a hedge against the Canadian dollar because the value of BTC has followed the value of the USD not CAD. If pegging was the wrong word then I'm not sure what term to use.
@_date: 2016-06-16 06:01:51
Or maybe it's because the price has gone up and people are moving around their bitcoins but can't because the blocks are too damn full. Maybe it's because they are using old outdated wallets from years ago with low hardcoded fees.
Not everything is a fuckin conspiracy, sometimes the people in charge are just dumb and we had the chance to address this months ago but didn't. 
People always underestimate the risk of the status quo and overestimate the risk of change.
I've been following bitcoin for many years now and previously the bubbles would pop when the exchange malfunctioned, the last one popped with China 'banning' bitcoin. This one will pop when all these new users realize they can't use the bitcoins for shit because the blocks are still the same size as they were 6 years ago.

Well it was decided by supreme court that code is a form of speech, coming from the 90s when the US tried to ban the export of PGP encryption (whatever the fuck that means).
Ultimately they had to print out the machine code on paper, bind it in a book and distribute copies in order to prove the point. The supreme court decided that banning books wasn't a good look and a precedent was formed.
These days free speech is much less valued. Many people see it as a nuisance to enable trolls and hateful people. Without a populace to defend free speech we'll lose it. The rest of freedom will soon follow and we all end up like China. Every government in world wishes they were China and they are watching closely to learn from China's modern mass oppressive techniques.

Which is why I said 'with added complexity'. There are some stark differences: 
1. Mt. Gox was a centralized repository of bitcoins controlled by a human, the DAO was decentralized repository of eth controlled by code and not a human.
2. The Mt. Gox attack was executed behind closed doors, through obscurity. The DAO attack has been executed in plain sight with a 27 day timer.
3. The Mt. Gox attack amounted to maybe 5% of all bitcoins in circulation. The DAO amounts to almost 33% of all ethereum in circulation. 
4. Because of all the offchain transactions, it would have been impossible to use software to unravel the damage of Mt. Gox. The *temptation* for ethereum to use software to unravel the damage of the DAO is substantial not only because of the economic significance to the project as a whole, but because of the overall simplicity of it. 
As with Mt. Gox, the mainstream media will incorrectly report that currency has been hacked when that is not the case. Ethereum is stuck the dilemma of losing public trust of the protocol (which is not in question) or losing the good will of its participants.

Like I say it's more of an advanced feature to give absolute control over individual private keys. 
These days most wallets use what's called HD wallet addresses. Which means a new bitcoin address is created every time your receive bitcoins or when sending your 'change' gets sent to a new address as well. This is good for privacy reasons. It also means a single 'seed' can restore ALL the private keys to all the addresses even if you had hundreds of them.
Exporting individual private keys would be useful in certain migration circumstances or if you wanted to export a single output and not the whole wallet. It gets a bit more complicated but to understand you need to know the difference between HD wallets and individual addresses, that bitcoin requires you to use an entire output every time you send even a tiny amount. You don't need to understand this to use bitcoin safely, just to understand the use case for private key exports.

The difference between bitcoin and ICOs is **issuance**. 
Where do bitcoins come from? Where do ICO coins come from?
If I wipe my ass with a whitepaper and say this is the basis for my ICO and then everybody gives me their ETH or BTC, what have they bought? They then trade these asswipe paper coins among themselves all hoping for the greater fool to buy it for more than they paid. 
No single entity controls the issuance of BTC. It is only by consensus and only by the rules. Buying BTC with USD does NOT enrich a single entity to run off with the USD. Buying an ICO with BTC DOES allow the single issuing entity to run off with the BTC.

Yeah you spend money to aquire bitcoin the asset but you never pay the issuer of Bitcoin. You may pay an asic company for a miner but they don't issue bitcoin. You may pay the electrical company to run the miner, but they don't issue bitcoin. You may even use money to buy bitcoin from someone else, but they didn't issue bitcoin either.
However, if I create 50B chuckycheesecoins in exchange for dollars or even bitcoin, I am personally issuing the coin which is a form of credit. I am being payed for the promise of being able to use chuckycheesecoins in the future; either for utility or a financial return.

There is always a difference between what is and what could be. I think it's important to judge the software for what it is right now. 
Back when I got into bitcoin in 2012 I was ultimately convicted of bitcoin's value because of what could be done with it at that time. As transactional friction increased, the narrative what bitcoin was meant for continued to change. 
The current state of the network is not as functional as it was before and instead we have a promissory plan for more function in the future. Bitcoin's problems are a victim of its own success. 
I'm a pretty hardcore idealist and always wanted bitcoin to be the technology that destroyed intermediaries and connected the billions of unbanked into a global economy.

This is misinformed. Doge and litecoin are very similar clones of bitcoin where as ethereum is very different. It provides different functions and doesn't compete directly with bitcoin. It's important that innovation continues within crypto, not everything is shitty altcoin.
That being said, ethereum is orders of magnitude more complicated than bitcoin and that to me screams bugs and flaws. In this case they predicated the value of their block chain on being able to autonomously enforce smart contracts. If they can't do that and bail out this badly written smart contract then the idea behind ethereum is in question.

Nobody gets any work done during a bull market. Bear markets are not as exciting and people tend to close the charts and go back to work. 
It took almost all of 2014 for the price to stop going down. It went sideways for pretty much  all of 2015. During 2016 the price did 3x but that wasn't exciting enough for most people.  
Realistically the volume is still pretty good considering the price action of the last 6 months. We could bounce to 10k and then bleed down to 3k, who knows. 
Either way the quick buck guys will be getting bored and leaving soon and we can get back to talking about building out infrastructure. It's exciting because there is so much work to do with lightening we *need* a bear market right now.

Yeah I think that's it. From a user's perspective it would be no different than loading a bitcoin wallet. Your lightening wallet will probably have only one channel with a large hub which will connect you to everyone else.
The problem I see is a situation where you'd like to receive more money than what was put into the channel originally. 
For instance you load your 'lightening wallet' with 1BTC, which you use for daily transactions. What happens if your paycheque is more than 1BTC? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:31:10
Sure it would. That's seems pretty authoritarian though don't you think? It's pretty hard to convince the public of some great danger posed by hardware wallets. Remember when they declared drugs illegal and removed the demand for drugs? Remember when they successfully were able to get rid of all the drugs with threats of violence or imprisonment? 
The speculative portion of the price would crash but the economic value of the system would remain. Slowly and surely the price would rise again, poor monetary policy of G7 countries would drive real demand. If Bitcoin was illegal, people wouldn't​ need to worry about claiming gains on their taxes or abiding by regulations. 
Bitcoin seems a little maniac​ sometimes because of how fast it rises but do not doubt it's patience. Bitcoin already did a two year bear market it could do much more than that. Obviously government decisions are not always rational or logical, but with proper assessment they would conclude there is more to lose by outlawing Bitcoin than there is by trying to regulate it.

Bitcoin enthusiasts need to be a little more introspective before they throw the baby out with the bath water. 
What do we really want bitcoin to be? A currency or a settlement platform? Or both?
As it sits now, just about everything bitcoin related is denominated in USD. So bitcoin isn't really a currency if nothing is ever priced in bitcoin. Of course volatility and all that as... reasons.
The powers that be would love to see bitcoin continue to be subservient to the all mighty USD, and for the time being we don't have a choice. But what does the future look like? 
So many people here just want some quick moon shot so they can 'cash out' (USD preferably), if that is the case then fiat wallets makes perfect sense. 
**There is a fine line between pursing mainstream adoption and giving up the core tenets that makes bitcoin attractive to begin with.**
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:07:24
I agree. I cringe at the amount of noobs who will be losing their Bitcoin to replay attacks or to the exposure of a crashing price. 
I also know that people don't change behavior unless they have had a catalyst in their lives to do so. Some people are just programmed to learn the hard way.
In ethereum we saw the price get pumped to insane heights in less than a year. A bunch of euphoric ETH heads then gave their ETH to ICOs in exchange for chucky cheese tokens. Those ICOs have then been selling that ETH for fiat or BTC.  It's a hard lesson made harder by greed. People need to see consequence before they are able to objectively observe delusion.

They did use multisig which is why the whole thing seems even more suspicious.
They we're one of the first exchanges to have a fully functional cold to hot wallet multisig system. Having used QCX for years I was always impressed with the technical performance of the platform. They were one of the first to use segwit and also integrate batching on crypto withdrawals. They were quick to credit depositors with forked coins.
All in all, the technical competence demonstrated over the years doesn't match the narrative of 'opps only one guy has the keys'.

Yes that is correct, but I think the vision is not for people to create channels between themselves. 
You instead create channels with hubs who have channels with many hubs. As long as your recipient has a channel open with a hub then you can route money to them (like the internet).

My point is that because Bitcoin is borderless it doesn't matter what a few countries don't want. Not *all* countries will fight it. The ones that embrace it will benefit. Look at Japan.
Governments have always tried to control their populace usually to the detriment of prosperity and quality of life. For an extreme example see North Korea. Countries that have had the most freedom usually have had the most economic prosperity, the U.S. used to be a good example of this. History isn't without a sense of irony.

@_date: 2019-02-02 20:29:25
I'll take a stab at it.
Bitcoin is its own network of nodes which cooperate to create a platform which can built upon. 
Whereas traditionally money (at the base layer) is a static instrument of property which requires physical transactions of human entities. Bitcoin doesn't have any such requirements and allows for money to be used as information programmatically by any entity.
Before you say computers use money in the traditional banking system, it might be important to point out those systems still ultimately require manual human settlement at the base layer.
So the internet of money is about changing the paradigm of money as a physical static instrument and instead using money as information programmatically.

That's not how it work in practice though. 
Most people will have only one channel with one hub node. How many ISPs are you connected to? Your ISP facilitates all of your connections with everyone else on the internet. It's pretty much the same model. Not everyone will want to be an ISP.
Your primary 'channel' will be with a large highly available hub, like an ISP. You won't be making channels with iPhone lightening hubs.

The scenario when Bitcoin markets don't give a shit because real supply is unaffected, those idiots who shorted to 2k would be in a world of hurt.
Likewise if some real BTC whale saw futures at 80% below spot they could make more buy longing the futures and then pumping the actual price. 
So it would appear to me that using fiat futures as a whale would only be worthwhile if you could also manipulate the spot price.

The invention of bitcoin is the security and immutability of an open ledger, that wasn't possible before it was invented. That security and immutability requires everyone to have access to it.

@_date: 2017-11-21 19:36:06
Yeah that's true. However in order to be a viable route you would need many channels. 
Most transactions will follow path of least resistance which will centralize to large hubs transacting between large hubs.
If you were a merchant wanting to accept lightening payments who would you want to open a channel with? Probably a large highly available hub like a bank that has adequate capital to keep its channels open and keep things flowing. 
Just like using a small ISP, they don't often have peering with big services like Google or Netflix. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:41:35
It's a metric of inflation. This directly affects the scarcity of the coin. Bitcoin hasn't suffered these types of exploits and I think that bodes well for its long term value.

Doesn't quite work like that. Within proof of work, the formula requires the cost of work to be more than the cost of attacking the network. This is the cost of maintaining an open ledger. Bitcoin becomes anti-fragile because it is completely exposed and public, it flips the traditional security model on its head. 
A dedicated industry would not be able produce enough 'work' to secure the value of their ledger if access to that ledger is restricted. In other words, the security would still come from *denying access* rather than bitcoin which allows it to anyone. With bitcoin there is no such thing as unauthorized access, everything is public.
The mainstream narrative of blockchain is great but bitcoin is bad demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology.

Blockchain on it's own is somewhat of a silly concept. It's a 1/3 ingredient of an amazing invention. Think of it like the bitcoin trinity. Blockchain (Nodes), PoW and Bitcoin (Currency). All 3 of these things are necessary for the system to work. Nodes maintain the immutable record (blockchain), miners secure additions to the record with provable work (PoW), and the currency token provides incentive to the miners. Try to discard 2/3 and stick with 'blockchain' and all you have is a slow bubble boy encrypted database.

I like this theory but the path of least resistance has shown us how it becomes centralized anyways.

Small time hubs with a few channels will be tapped out quickly and not earn enough fees to even pay for blockchain settlement.

I still don't think you're understanding what I'm trying to say. The whole purpose of the blockchain is that it can be maintained publicly. If you are going to deny access then you might as well stick with a regular replicating database over a VPN. The blockchain in and of itself is just blocks of information with a fancy cryptographic checksum. It's utterly worthless by itself. 
When you deny access to systems that are connected to the internet they will be hacked. It's not if but when. If you think it's possible to secure information by denying access then I have an Equifax database to sell you.

I think your imagination seems to stop at your border. The world is bigger than the United States. 
Bitcoin doesn't need all countries on earth to 'tolerate' it; it just needs some of them. The countries that do embrace bitcoin (probably less developed countries) will be able to do commerce with each other like never before. Countries that are too aggressive in 'regulating' bitcoin will find themselves being left out of significant trade markets. 
It's pretty hard to convince the public of some great danger posed by strings of random digits.. Remember when they declared drugs illegal and removed the demand for drugs? Remember when they successfully were able to get rid of all the drugs with threats of violence or imprisonment? 
The speculative portion of the price would crash but the economic value of the system would remain. Slowly and surely the price would rise again, poor monetary policy of G7 countries would drive real demand. If Bitcoin was illegal, people wouldn't​ need to worry about claiming gains on their taxes or abiding by regulations. 
Obviously government decisions are not always rational or logical, but with proper assessment they would conclude there is more to lose by outlawing Bitcoin than there is by trying to regulate it.

Bitcoin should be the primary currency unit and maybe have USD in brackets.

Well companies that don't actually accept Bitcoin use a processor like bitpay that has a cost. It looks like they took about 4% on the spread, but this obsession with getting the spot price is kinda dumb.

From a functional perspective I'm sure that would be fine. The security of the asset (bitcoin itself) is maintained regardless. 
However I would have concerns about transaction censorship within a centralized service layer. These centralized mega hubs could eventually collaborate by not creating channels with 'unauthorized' hubs. Those 'unauthorized' hubs could continue to develop channels amongst themselves, however they'd be cut out of the primary economy of the network.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:40:19
And realistically the primary core of the lightening network will be large hubs connected via many channels to many large hubs.
This is similar to the physical topology of the internet. Think of an ISP as a hub with a channel open to each of its customers. The ISP has channels open with other ISPs.

I agree with what you are saying, but some people who would use BTCpay are not concerned with fiat value but rather the quantity of BTC.
Until people are willing to peg value of products and services to a specific quantity of BTC the exchanges will always be in control. People price things in the currency they *actually* want and if that's dollars so be it. I would simply like the option of accumlating BTC on my terms not terms dictated by a third party exchange rate.
By not allowing me to price in BTC you are saying some exchange rate I can't control will dictate how much BTC I get.

As long as you have the keys to both wallets you won't lose anything. These days transactions can get stuck in bitcoin purgatory for a long time depending on how much fee you paid. It costs almost $1 worth of a BTC now to get a transaction into the chain within a couple of blocks. 
Either way, even if your transaction never gets confirmed it will eventually timeout and you'll have the option of trying again. This can sometimes take a few days.

You know it's a successful compromise when neither party is completely happy. Big blockers will feel like it isn't a large enough increase, seqwit purists will feel the increase is too much.
Ultimately as bitcoin matures it is going to be harder and harder and eventually impossible to ever reach a full hard fork consensus. Even now a fully technical solution is unlikely to be manifested, so we defer to the political solution. 
Those within camps of ideology must decide if it is better to be right and split the coin with all the damage and consequences OR compromise with something less than ideal but rebuild unity and trust.
As bitcoin grows the ignorant mob is going to be larger and larger and more influential. They don't possess the capacity to understand the nuances of technical debate to solve a specific problem. They do understand that there is a problem. To ignore this ignorant mob is to ignore those who wish to be a part of this system, the system itself; politics do play a role here and on that front those who see themselves as technical architects with strictly technical skills must understand that influence is not based on technical merit, but rather the ability to convey that technical merit.

ETH is still at least a blockchain where tokens are issued as per the consensus rules (you don't pay Vitalik to issue ETH tokens). Glossing over the fact that 1/3rd of all issued coins were essentially premined (through proof of burn), Ethereum does provide value in the form of utility.

Well in one aspect he's still not wrong. In regards to liquidity the price is somewhat a mirage. Liquidity is getting better and will improve over time but this is a giant obstacle for big money.
People refer to this 80 billion dollar market cap as if there is 80 billion worth of liquidity waiting for someone to 'cash out'. The the reality is the price and 'market cap' are simply a valuation and provide no guarantees to be able to convert BTC at that price. 
The liquidity is so bad selling a couple million bucks worth of Bitcoin can move the price 5%. You see all these big buy walls in the order book but the moment you hit that order book with any significant BTC those bids and asks disappear and the goal posts move. That's what makes it a mirage.

It is scary that 'the cloud' has ruined everyone's desire for autonomy and digital self determination. In the early days of the internet, people would have relished the privilege to run a service and participate in the creation of a platform. These days the mere convenience of a centralised service trumps all rights to data that is exchanged.
So ultimately it will be laziness and convenience that destroys the distinct value proposition of one of the greatest inventions of human civilisation. As we centralise and consolidate all of our digital worlds we hand over the keys of our lives to corporate and state control.

A government doesn't need a blockchain for a 'traceable digital currency'. They actually already have it, it's called dollars. 99% of dollars that exist *do not* exist as cash. The government doesn't want another form cash, like you said they've been getting rid of it. They already control issuance of fiat; they already control money flow and identity management through KYC and AML. 
Now stay with me here. Any form of real digital currency must facilitate peer to peer transactions. Meaning if it really was a currency unit and it really was digital, I should be able to give those units to another human being. Now even if my identity was attached to those units you can't prevent human beings exchanging those units for something else (think yard sale principle). And if in fact the currency unit was digital it would be *programmatically* possible to exchange that currency unit for another digital currency. Perhaps one with a more transparent issuance schedule and built in scarcity. Perhaps one without big brother data miners monitoring every transaction. 
If you think government is capable of banning peer to peer transactions then I'm not sure what sort of horrible dystopia you envision where that is possible. 
Just to clarify, I don't think fiat is going away anytime soon. What I do believe is that the monetary policy of fiat controllers will be held accountable by uncensorable, highly transportable, deflationary asset class with transparent and provable issuance. You can already see this in action in Venezuela and other countries where central bankers can't restrain themselves with their careless monetary policies.

Problem is there is very little to adopt in terms of bitcoin as a currency. 
We've actually gone backwards on merchant adoption. Bitpay has closed up operations in my country (Canada). The primary factor being scalability issues and increasing friction on bitcoin transfers (fees). Increasing pressure on the fiat side by big banks.
Wallet software has not evolved that much, hardware wallet development has somewhat stagnanted. 
I believe in bitcoin long term as there is more to it than using it for everyday things. I also believe that layer 2 solutions will solve a lot of problems.
However in terms of adoption, we are super far away from mainstream usage. Bitcoin isn't ready yet. Instead of being obsessed with the fiat price we should be obsessed with providing more utility than Bitcoin does already. After all this is programmable money and it can be upgraded. I worry about this because this community used to be more passionate about using Bitcoin for different things. I hope to get back to that. These are growing pains and we must all be vigilant to keep our eyes on the prize.

What would be funny to me is if they weren't able to manipulate bitcoin prices as effectively as they anticipated with their cash settled futures products so now they need another tool in their arsenal, paper bitcoins.
Just like paper gold they can start by accumulating real bitcoins with other people's money and then later use that stash for price manipulation. They could allow naked shorts, use fractional reserve or all sorts of nefarious things. If shit goes sideways they claim they were 'hacked' and insurance covers the loss. No risk!
I'm hoping these 'accredited' investors are smarter than this. Why would you want paper bitcoins when you could pay coinbase or gemini for a true custodian account that is also insured? Seems like counterparty risk would be similar except worse because you don't control the actual bitcoins and you have no idea if CBOE is fucking over the value of your investment with the actual bitcoins. Remember the insurance isn't to replace your paper bitcoins, the insurance covers the paper value of your paper bitcoins.

What makes matters worse is that they've figured out how to use inflation against those who create value (middle class) without depreciating the value of their stored assets (stocks, bonds, etc).
I call this the big squeeze. 
Inflation was initially an economic mechanic used to beat the rich with a giant club to encourage them to spend their money. When they spent their saved money it would promote growth and economic output. 
Inflation is now absorbed by stock exchanges like a sponge and if you create enough derivatives based on derivatives which are backed by derivatives which are stored in derivatives etc, you can watch the numbers go to infinity without causing any 'real inflation'. The real problem is there are trillions of dollars without a job. It just has to sit in a giant silo and do nothing because using that money would just enrich your competitors or empower your adversaries. Essentially the exact opposite conclusion that inflation was supposed to solve.
Now we have inflation increasing the cost of food and energy and other durable goods because these are static variables of consumption that are actually needed by any economy. At the same time wages are stagnant because work is becoming more scarce due to efficiencies of automation etc, and because millennials aren't buying as much useless shit as their parents did. This is a negative feedback loop that begins the degrowth\depopulation era. Good timing too, because if not death by collapsing economy then it would have been death by climate change.

You make some good points but I think your imagination seems to stop at your border. The world is bigger than the United States. 
Bitcoin doesn't need all countries on earth to 'tolerate' it; it just needs some of them. The countries that do embrace bitcoin (probably less developed countries) will be able to do commerce with each other like never before. Countries that are too aggressive in 'regulating' bitcoin will find themselves being left out of significant trade markets. 
Blockchain on it's own is somewhat of a silly concept. It's a 1/3 ingredient of an amazing invention. Think of it like the bitcoin trinity. Blockchain (Nodes), PoW and Bitcoin (Currency). All 3 of these things are necessary for the system to work. Nodes maintain the immutable record (blockchain), miners secure additions to the record with provable work (PoW), and the currency token provides incentive to the miners. Try to discard 2/3 and stick with 'blockchain' and all you have is a slow bubble boy encrypted database.

The characters in the historical Bible we're just humans of that time so you read the Bible though that historical context. Much of the Bible was written with the people of that time as the intended audience so that is also an important lens.
However even if everything in the Bible was historically false, the psychological truth is still just as profound as the day it was written. The instructions and values of Jesus give you a blueprint for true joy and fufillment even on this planet. Jesus talks about the kingdom of heaven which is state of being achievable in this life.
The ultimate irony is that people would rather read the mindless obnoxious ramblings of internet idiots on Reddit then even read one of the Gospels.

Ummm the Bible spells it out pretty clearly, it's not subjective. 
To be a Christian you must believe Jesus was both God and man and that he was killed and was raised from the dead. You must believe he died for the sins of humanity and that he offers mercy, grace and salvation to those that believe in him. (John 3:16)
By accepting His gift through repentance you desire to change your life to become more 'Christ like', trying to demonstrate the values of Jesus Christ in your everyday life. 
Christianity is a religion which is a man made institution (all religions are). The testimony of Jesus Christ is not man made and implores specific actions of the believer:
1. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul and all your mind.
2. Love your neighbor as you would love yourself.
It is not for us to judge who is a Christian or who is not, only God can see the heart of man. However I believe it is fairly reasonable to assume that individuals who do not demonstrate the attitude and values of Jesus to not hold a real belief in Christ.
Consider that the Bible is the most prolific piece of literature in human history. There has been no other sacred text that has maintained its integrity and authenticity for the thousands of years it has been around. Now consider how many people these days have even read the New Testament. Have you read it? Why not? 
Everything you have in your life right is probably less than 100 years old. How arrogant would you have to be to dismiss the wisdom of thousands of years for the garbage of our current time?

This also explains why bitcoin *has* to be deflationary as well as how it needs to float with its own value compared to fiat. 
Fiat *has* to be inflationary for governments to exert control over monetary policy and control global trade. 
It isn't unreasonable to expect a deflationary international currency to coexist with with an inflationary national currency. What you have then, in respect to something like bitcoin is a way of doing instant arbitrage for global trade. Currently the USD is the closest thing to an international currency in that almost all countries on earth want at least some of it. If that began to change and we saw the rise of even 2 more dominate reserve currencies then bitcoin could provide a massive value on settlement/arbitrage alone.

Bitpay has always been more forward looking than Coinbase, they've always done a good job of carrying bitcoin's interest to their customers.
Which is why I trust them even with this deal with an unsavoury character. Bitcoin has history of attracting ruthless, selfish and borderline psychopathic personalities, that doesn't mean these people aren't useful to bitcoin. Mark Karpeles was a dick head but without him we might not have had early price discovery or as much adoption as we did early on. 
Jihan may be an extremely self interested dickhead and oblivious to the damage he is causing as a result of his behaviour, but he has contributed some of the best asic miners on the market. The primary purpose of these miners is to secure the chain. He has invested a lot into bitcoin and bitpay is simply bringing him to invest even more. Most people don't want to shoot themselves in the face. 
Bitpay has contributed more to bitcoin then almost any other company, so for me they have a lot of credibility to burn through. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and will judge the results of this relationship as it manifests itself.

He's somehow managed to combine both his persona and identity into some psudeo-celebrity brand. He has the self awareness to see how the world sees him and turns it into a product.
You see some of these traits in Donald Trump, although I would argue the Donald is much less sincere than McAfee, and much less interesting.

I'm sure there may be some middle ground, but often these ideas that mean well are corrupted over time. 
The only reason I made the comment is that it seems to me with something like bitcoin, where scarcity is permanently enforced, it would be better to just destroy the coins increasing the value for all those who have bitcoins.

There are better ways of doing paper wallets that look and work the same but are entirely different. Having a single private key on a piece of paper is not a wallet. 
The software has moved on to something better. We need documentation to reflect that. Maybe 'paper ECDSA private key' is a dumb name, but 'paper wallet' is almost equally as dumb.

Subsidizing LE with proceeds from civil forfeiture creates the wrong incentive for which crimes are worked on. You really think LE wants to spend time finding some violent serial killer rapist when there is no payout? They would rather go after crimes in which there is a payday.
IMO violent crime should ALWAYS be a priority. Things can be replaced but people can not.
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:42:29
Because a single key isn't a wallet, where the software has evolved to have deterministic key generate many keys that make a wallet.
Remember this is bitcoin so everyone has a self-interest including the OP who sells 'paper wallet' CDs and stickers. Of course he would be opposed to renaming these types of keys.

This is a valid criticism against the specific community who has no interest in sound money but rather a fiat price equivalent. 
I can't imagine the possibility of bitcoin doing another 100x is the same as it was 4 years ago and those types of returns are going to become statistically less significant. Nothing short of complete collapse of USD will push it higher. USD will probably collapse at some point but that doesn't mean it will be next year or the next 10 years or even the next 50 years. 
The question is, what motivation will there be for new buyers to trade fiat for bitcoin when fiat equivalency returns are less than 5% per year? Stock market equities generally out perform gold, so if investment is the only value proposition to bitcoin it becomes less attractive over time. Especially so if risk and volatility remain the same and yet returns become less. Whatever happened to bitcoin having at least some value derived from its utility?
Will we ever see a day when BTC truely becomes range bound? For now it seems there is no floor and there is no ceiling.

Unfortunately us humans rarely change our bad behaviors/habits before we have suffered a consequence. I tell my users all the time "don't leave important files on your desktop, put it on the fucking server". Then, when their hard drive inevitably dies they are coming at me in a panic wanting to bail them out. I say "did you put your files on the server?", "nope, I had them on the desktop". Guess what? That user never makes that mistake again, and they always put their files on the server now.

I'm down voting you not because you express a dissenting opinion but because the premises of your statements are based on false information. 
Bitcoin right now is acting like more of a commodity than currency, but that has absolutely nothing to do with its price. Remember bitcoins are infinitely divisible and right now 1mBTC =~$1 so accordingly to your logic that is acceptable. 
As volatility comes down bitcoin will become more useful as a currency, and of course we should be pushing towards that.

Short term volatility will torpedo the chance of bitcoin success in the long term because people will tire of the unnecessary process of converting fiat to BTC and vice versa. Not to mention the added fees associated with it. Ironically, bitcoin's demise will be from some of the very same problems it set out to solve.

Which is why charge backs are ultimately the problem for a variety of online transactions.

There is a growing movement in India of highly entrepreneurial women that are embracing new ideas to make money. They have the imagination and ambition to make a serious dent in Indian BTC adoption. 
There is simply far too few female bitcoin enthusiasts, and we need more women involved to provide a wider breadth of ideas and perspectives to properly shape the direction of Bitcoin.
As a fundamental difference in biology, women generally don't care about how something works as compared to the end result. Women compare fiat money with bitcoin and if it seems to accomplish the same purpose they see no value in switching. We will win women's hearts and minds by appealing to the ideology of what bitcoin can accomplish and how it will change the world. You see the woman in the video talk about how bitcoin to her means freedom. She sees the disruptive potential of bitcoin as well as an opportunity to make money.

@_date: 2013-11-12 22:53:14
Macro economics aside, the fundamental way bitcoin works both as a currency and as a payment processing network is light years beyond what is available in the old fiat network. Middlemen bankers taking fees on fees on fees to transport value in some cases less than a few feet. Also the arrogance to take a percentage of the value as a fee for transfer is ridiculous when the cost of transferring that value is a fixed rate (ie. accepting credit cards). 
If you wanted to get into the deflationary feature of bitcoin and its affect on macro economics as a whole then I would probably still somewhat disagree with you. Over consumption is a fundamental problem with our current banking system. There is no incentive to save, only spend and consume. With a finite amount of resources on this planet, we cannot afford a monetary system that is ever expanding and increasing of consumption. Deflationary economics is a bit of a lifestyle change where we all consume less. Debt can still be issued without interest or even a negative interest rate. It is a different way of looking at the world and living your life.  
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:51:42
Yeah I certainly didn't mean obsolete as in fiat is going away... shit, there are still companies that are using Internet Explorer v6.
You are definitely right in that American and European governments have no incentive to adopt bitcoin. Fiat currency will be around for a long long time to come. Perhaps in about 10 years if the BRICs (read mainly China) take a strong position in bitcoin, we'll see the beginning of the end for US dollar as a reserve currency. 
Bitcoin is so much more than a currency when you look at the global ramifications of its adoption. Like the Internet, it has the potential to be a catalyst for freedom, equality and prosperity. Like the Internet, it has the potential to be a crowning achievement of human civilization.    
Whether or not Bitcoin lives up to its potential remains to be seen, but I'm getting more excited all the time when I see how fast things are progressing. Saying things like "Magic Internet money makes old banker's money obsolete" is simply a way of captivating the imagination of those who have no desire to understand the complexity of currencies, debt or macro economics. I've tried to explain bitcoin to many people; some people get it, most are just overwhelmed with how complicated it is. 'Magic Internet money' makes a lot more sense to some people people than a decentralized blockchain ledger of cryptographic hashes. Sorry I'm probably rambling now.

@_date: 2013-11-19 19:41:14
As someone who doesn't live in the US I would say it is important to use as little regulation as possible. Bitcoin is an international phenomenon and too many legal restrictions/regulation will stifle innovation, create unnecessary barriers to entry and put Americans at a competitive disadvantage. China is already looking to be major player and like the rest of the world, will continue to develop and take advantage of the economic freedom bitcoin provides. Bitcoin will be good for all humanity by empowering individuals to cooperate economically on a global scale like never before. It removes the middleman and gatekeepers and creates a true free market. The bankers of bitcoin future will provide layered services and infrastructure that add value and consumer protections, however their patronage will be optional and not required for basic commerce.
Obviously we don't want bitcoin to be used by criminals, but there has to be a balance between protections and maintaining the bastion of freedom and liberty that bitcoin represents.

All of your points are good and valid. I was thinking about more of a macro scale. Since btc is international it is easier to move money overseas and avoid tax.

Most transactions are not done in cash anymore, probably because they don't want it to be.

I think steve_b accurately describes the current security situation of bitcoin, but I also think storing your own BTC on your local machine is reasonably safe for small amounts. Just like walking around with $100 in paper money is reasonably safe. 
BTC is very wild west right now and will take a while for idiot proof insurance backed solutions to emerge that will make it possible for common folk to use bitcoins. Of course these types of services will probably cost a fair premium. 
Think of the current state of bitcoin as a platform or foundation of which to build an entire banking economic system on. The core functionality is very solid but also very raw. There will always be those who choose to use bitcoin in it's raw form (like the more evolved version of stuffing cash in a mattress), but the rest of society will more than likely use the systems that are layered on top of this foundation.
