Nothing - I actually use the same dedi as a test-bed for a Puppet module I've written. The dedi was a donation from an old hosting provider at a previous job :)

My node was bootstrapped with the [bootstrap.dat]( file, so the daemon only needs to top up the difference between the tip of the bootstrap and current network height.
If you _really_ want to download the entire blockchain, your bottleneck will most likely be disk I/O or CPU rather than network traffic.

I've not really noticed that much of a hit in uptime on upgrades, a kernel upgrade is just a reboot and takes ~30 seconds, a bitcoind upgrade is a simple service restart and takes ~10 seconds. If you're lucky enough, you'll miss the Bitnodes 'ping' tests.
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:07:16
Thanks, that usually happens when the script can't get the network height from Bitnodes.21.co for some reason. I'll get the code changed to handle that, thanks :)

My node is 100% controlled and configured with Puppet, and I've written a module to install and manage a headless bitcoind daemon, links: [Puppet Forge]( and [GitHub](
The guide essentially is "use Puppet, install module, tweak parameters, run Puppet".

I've done it using iptables, blocking inbound port 8333 from 138.197.0.0/16 and 138.68.0.0/16

CIDRs are common notation for IP address ranges. For example: 192.168.1.0/24 means any address from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 (0 and 255 are reserved addresses).
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:37:45
I'd look at the scores for each individual component of the score, and work on those. I ended up firewalling out all Digital Ocean IPs as they were hurting my client score (the more distinct networks you connect to, the more widely spread the nodes you serve, and the better your node serves the community).
Also being the only node on my network ASN helps - Bitnodes scores that quite highly as being decentralised doesn't really matter if all of your nodes are on the same network segment. If you're using a provider like Digital Ocean, AWS, Google Cloud or any major VPS provider, chances are there will be other nodes on your network segment, so you'll always get &lt; 1.0 there.
Other than that, latency needs to be &lt; 300ms and your node needs to be running the most common client (not necessarily the latest). I've been caught out there in the past.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:49:21
Latest doesn't always mean best. The Bitnodes formula values the most common version via mathematical consensus, rather than the latest.
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:30:48
A CIDR is an IP notation - e.g. 10.0.0.0/24 which means an IP address of 10.0.0.0 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0, which translates to anything between 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.254.
You can find the CIDR of an IP by checking Whois.

Thanks! 17GaL8LcCirstzAg68svbJoHAQdeDxHjo5 - the address is also on the node status page (linked on the OP), I'm also the author of the status page code (available on GitHub via the top-right ribbon).
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:27:44
haha, thanks very much :) 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:35:54
 I admit that genuine users like yourself will undoubtedly be caught in the same firewall rule (there's around 130,000 IPs in the two ranges I have blocked), but sadly I didn't really see much of a choice when 50% or more of my connections were from a single CIDR of IP addresses and were staying connected for days, taking up connection slots that could be used better serving other nodes :(
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:34:03
Final sentence removed, not really sure why it's classed as "begging" - I'm not a commercial developer, nor am I advertising any services, but hey.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:16:30
Thanks for your snarky reply that does nothing but underline my point. I think after 4 years of observing the community, reading the white papers, looking at what altcoins bring to the table, how they work and all of the nuances that Bitcoin and crypto has, I do get it.
I think that your reply reinforces the internet-enabled bitchiness that has enveloped many communities and actually is one of the reasons Bitcoin will fail.
Communities need to be communities, not snarky back-biting bitch-fests that the Bitcoin world has become.
As for my BTC, I have not actually bought as much as a single Satoshi, it has - all 0.007 of it - been donated as a result of my open source contributions, so it really has no special value to me and as a result, I have nothing of real value to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:18:05
Sadly I don't think I've ever actually talked to anyone who's interested in using Bitcoin as a serious currency. It just has a reputation as a get-rich-quick medium due to the hype of the community. Ironically, back in the Silk Road days it was actually being used for its primary purpose - as a currency.
@_date: 2015-08-26 08:29:01
Not sure what you mean here, the JSON I actually load is small for a reason - I only need the max height, not any of the other info.
Unless you're saying I should include some of the other info?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:43:15
Yeah, I'm persevering - even when I can get all the way to the withdrawal page, I can't actually confirm the withdrawal. Can't get my BTC away from Kraken quickly enough.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:24:30
Out of curiosity, what happens to your BTC once you’ve accepted it as payment from customers?
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:06:45
"Buying the dips" and "HODL"ing is creating a illusion that Bitcoin is a commodity to be bought and sold, rather than a currency that should be used to buy commodities.
If Bitcoin and the blockchain is such a worthy technological marvel, it should be able to stand on its own feet, rather than being propped up by a community that is hellbent on furthering itself, rather than the currency.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:23:56
Not necessarily. Holding onto BTC with a view to spend it in the future on material goods is the basis of a currency. 
Holding onto BTC with a view to sell back into fiat and effectively treating the entire thing as a get-rich-quick scheme, on the other hand, is nothing but greed-lead profiteering that leads to widespread miscommunication and misinformation about what Bitcoin is actually for. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:04:58
Hey - sure, fork away!
Will always consider new features, what did you have in mind?
Cheers for the tip, appreciated!
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:23:02
Just, took a while with a lot of 500s from CloudFlare and a lot of UI errors from Kraken, but the whole platform feels exceptionally creaky. I also got a random error that "Your current funding tier level (3) is insufficient for this functionality" - my tier should allow me to withdraw a crapton more than a measly 0.008 BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:16:02
That still considers BTC as a commodity. Saying that the haircut costs $500 still means that your brain is fundamentally wired to convert BTC back to USD, so the "real" value to you is $500, not 0.05 BTC or whatever.
@_date: 2015-08-26 08:32:58
The Block Explorer stuff would be pretty cool, though I'm unsure if the node control is something that would be appropriate.
That said, if the control just extends to the Bitcoin daemon and can be done over RPC, it shouldn't be too difficult - I'm just conscious of the project becoming too specialist :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:12:29
I'm not talking about large forex exchanges - I'm talking about the average-joe currency exchange where people go to buy holiday money. In order to be a stable mechanism of paying for goods, the currency has to be credible, which also means that it needs to be usable by those people.

This is more related to queueing than SQL - transfers submitted earlier this morning are now clearing.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:39:09
Ah, perhaps there could be a way of flagging that for people who don't post here often? :)
@_date: 2017-04-28 12:36:44
If you've worked with or within banks, you'd understand the state of their infrastructure - scaling (or indeed doing anything) within a financial institution takes weeks (if not months).
Also, a bank account isn't necessarily analogous to a SQL table - yes it's transactional in nature, however those transactions need to be highly regulated, checked and queued to ensure they hit the account in the right order.
Obviously something within their infrastructure is broken, and they have a backlog of transactions to clear - their systems are queueing them up for processing.
Perhaps a WAN link has failed between two facilities and data is being passed through a lower-bandwidth backup link. Perhaps power has been interrupted to one or a number of racks in a datacentre, and the rest of the infrastructure is struggling to cope with the increased load. Unless Natwest do a full and open RCA (which I severely doubt they will), we will never know the true cause.
All I can see is two transfers made within 1 minute of each other this morning have both been completed successfully - one at around 12:30 and one at 1:30. This is also being bourne out by accounts posted on Twitter.
So in summary, this does suggest some kind of queueing issue where there's a bottleneck at one layer (possibly compute, possibly network, possibly disk, possibly all three).
As a systems engineer/SRE, I would be astounded if they didn't have some kind of resiliency for this kind of problem - all of the FUD about funds "disappearing" is unfounded.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:33:14
Care to explain why?
@_date: 2017-04-28 07:54:39
Nope, I upgraded it to 0.14.1 :)
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:37:47
Right, so an opinionated tweet? Can anyone give any _technical_ reason?
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:25:56
Because I weight stability higher than running the latest code :)
@_date: 2015-03-18 10:03:03
Cheers for the tip :D
@_date: 2015-03-18 13:55:17
Less of the language bashing please. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 10:02:52
No problem - thanks for putting the library out there :)
@_date: 2015-03-21 22:41:15
Should also add I now have Travis CI testing PHP syntax and also PEAR standards compliance :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:06:36
And now you have no excuse - no dirty config files to edit either: 
@_date: 2015-03-18 12:16:24
Thanks for the tip - though looks like ChangeTip has screwed up and credited it wrongly (showing as a Wallet Error for me).
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:55:00
That's gone through this time - thanks for the tip, appreciated :)
@_date: 2015-03-18 10:01:37
Thanks for all the hints - I'm a fairly novice PHP coder (I wouldn't even call myself a developer - I'm a sysadmin by profession!).
I've just made those changes :)
