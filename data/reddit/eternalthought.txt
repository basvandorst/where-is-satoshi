I think you can just reset the device (input the pin code wrong 3 times), and then youll get the option of choosing between setting up a device or recovering with the seed. If you set up a new one, you'll get a new seed.

even assuming your worst case scenario: some payments will work. besides, no one HAS to use it, the regular on chain transaction option is still there, only now at least some of the load will shift towards the LN, even if it doesn't work the best.
How exactly is it worst than not having it at all?

Am I the only one surprised to see bitmain contribute to bitcoin core (and to a lesser extent, blockchain and coinbase)? I thought bitmain were very much against core's development and direction with the asicboost thing and in general them preferring bcash.

Won't the effect of this be diminished the more LN is used?
I imagine the real impact of this will be on things like big exchanges, but when LN gets more adoption and exchanges will use those too, where can we expect this to make the most impact?

I've noticed a bunch of wallets/services that already have integration with nano, seems it's getting more popular.
I believe its cheaper too.
About the closed-source, they say it's only for one hardware/chip part of the device, since it's third party and they can't disclose how that part works.

Why spam? I have a ~33 sat/b transaction I made 2 weeks ago, just because it wasn't urgent and I wasn't willing to pay the crazy fees.
Make's sense people will try to do this now especially since the mempool declogged a bit.

I think that if you really want to promote this freedom/anti-establishment attitude you should try to USE your bitcoins as much as possible and not just to hold them (while still not being disheartened by price drops).
The more people will actually use it, the more freedom value it will have (and consequently, higher $/commodity value).

Definitely segwit. Though if you started on legacy and don't plan to move them for a while, might as well just keep the BTC there until fees are more reasonable.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:55:33
Well, technology wise you are right. But for reasonable/low fees, it currently sees faster confirmations (that's what I meant by fast).
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:34:11
It's mostly the fees issue since they were immediately converting the bitcoins into dollars, so they would always get their desired dollar price, just in bitcoins. The problem is the fees for fast confirmations were too high.

What kind of business is tied to location besides physical mining or services that depend on physical infrastructure?
If you're going to mine near a green source of energy like solar or wind or geothermal, that's very location dependent. I agree that in some cases the location can easily change if for some reason a new region has an excess of electricity to offer cheaply, but that still sounds like you're the one that need to chase that energy arbitrage by packing all your mining gear and move there.
But that energy arbitrage thing is still a very nice way to look at mining.

A bit technical but I hope you can give some insight: Consider the following situation: 1. Alice buys 4 bitcoins that are sent to address A (so Alice has unspent output of 4 BTC in address A) 2. Alice sends 1 BTC with very low fees from address A to address B. The change is returned to address A (so A is also in the output of this transaction) The transaction is now stuck in the mempool. 3. Alice gets impatient and sends 2 BTC from A to B with very high fees.
What would happen? Does the second A-&gt;B transaction gets confirmed fast, using the original unspent output from the initial bitcoin purchase? Or is the second transaction using the unconfirmed output of the first low-fee transaction? If so, why? How can it use the first transaction output if it's not on the blockchain yet? Wouldn't that create a situation where you can't transfer your funds AT ALL until the first transaction is confirmed, which might take a very long while?

It's a fork of bitcoin that went in a different route to solve the scaling problem and high fees of bitcoin, by increasing the blocksize limit.
Currently it is cheaper and faster to use, but also less known and recognized, but more importantly, some say the uncapped blocksize increase will lead later on to centralisation of the nodes in the system, which is in contrast to some of the key ideas of bitcoin.

It generates different addresses so it'll look like your account is empty. From what I understand it's essentially a different wallet. Don't be alarmed though because you can always switch back via the settings.
I think that to switch you basically need to send yourself the bitcoins. Get a receive address from the segwit wallet, write it down, switch to the legacy and then send to that address.
I haven't tried that, since I started with segwit, but maybe there's an automated way to do it. There's a ledger Reddit where I'm sure you can get more detailed answers.

I like the general arguments but how can he say right at the start that mining is geographically-independent and then right after say it depends on how much the electricity costs, which is very geographic.
Also, this does sound like an interesting physics thought experiment, of gauging the energy required for mining vs energy required by, say, all the data-centers or computer-related actions of things like paypal or credit cards (I don't count the offices etc. because miners have that kind of stuff as well.

I'm trying to get away from blockchain.info, not Bcore, but anyway I need to make sure I can actually transfer my funds from blockchain.info and that they arent stuck there until the low-fee confirms...
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:32:54
I believe there will be a balance, as some people will prefer to use transactions on the blockchain directly.
I mean, if fees are low, why not use that? Or if you want to transfer larger sums of money (which I believe LN handles less well). So there will be a market for that, up to the point that for smaller or more daily transactions it'll be more efficient to use LN.
So I don't expect the blocks to be too empty, and even if some miners quit, the few that remain will be rewarded with more blocks, another point of equilibrium.

I generally agree with the direction, but I have a couple of things that I'm not I'm getting.


Introducing segwit is another. (Already implemented, but still not as widely adopted as it could be.)
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't segwit technically a blocksize increase, in that it really actually allows relaying and transferring bigger blocks (that is, more bytes pet block, which requires more bandwidth), but the difference is that its voluntary and not a hardfork?
Despite all that, if everyone eventually switched to segwit, the blocks that would propagate through the network would really have 2MB of data instead of 1, and increase the bandwidth and disk space.
Another thing is about the optimizing space usage while blockchain space is scarce.
You say that we should incentivize people to use the optimized solutions by making block space scarce, but it's not like we can reach a point where we can declare the block space usage is 100% optimized now and we can start only increase blocksizes linearly with demand.
These are things that will probably have to happen in parallel at some point, and if that's the case, why not start now (or at least start now to figure out how to do it best)?
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:47:32
So your'e saying that the signature data isn't being saved on the blockchain, and so it doesn't take space?
But it is being relayed and propagated through the network?
Then from what I understand the negative effect of increasing the blocksize (more bandwidth required, which I believe is the bigger issue with big blocks) will still impact anyone who runs a full node, and the only difference is that it was done in a backwards compatible manner.
Now if hard forking is such a potentially dangerous business, doing it later down the road when there's a much higher level of optimization but also of network usage, will be even harder, so I'm not sure why not plan out/test it somehow already.

With violence? Organisations go to bakeries and threaten to (or do) beat people up because they won't make cakes? Can I have a source for that?

Worth mentioning that since this problem is basically with the chrome-based UI, you could also just switch to electrum and use that as your UI (and possibly other wallets that have hardware wallet integration), same as using MyEtherWallet will help in case of ethereum.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:33:12
But you CAN re-send to the same address on which you tested, it'll still work.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:05:08
Not sure why it won't appear in moderate blocksize increase but thanks, clarified a few things for me.
