In what way is his math wrong?  GBTC owns like 1.43% of btc if thats what you mean

key word "ASK" ;)

I believe they are quite a common type of atm, across europe

I'd assume it would be on a per day basis due to employee's recognising people.

I tried getting my friends into it but they all say "im not interested", sad to see

He responds to a tweet about gold anonymity becoming harder due to laws restricting the amount you can purchase, clearly trying to make btc seem fully anonymous

Think it worked out to be around 15% kinda harsh but it's a fun little experience :)

Buy and sell btc with no KYC, also makes bitcoin more public as it's in an area with a lot of foot traffic meaning people will see it. It can also print out a private key + QR with the btc you bought or straight to your wallet using QR or manually entered address.

I'm not saying it wont go up again, all I am saying is the 19k price was only for a short time in 2017...
It went down and you didn't include it, its misleading and not explaining the price is volatile, and its an investment and not a get rich quick scheme

He is referring to purchase limits of btc like there is no KYC, if he isn't referring to anonymity then he is just replying to the tweet for no reason. The tweet he replied to states gold is becoming harder to purchase in bulk without ID and thats all.
If he was referring to purchase limits then his point is still invalid due to the requirement for KYC on every trusted exchange. The only limit shown in the tweet he was replying too was the 10k limit in Germany right now becoming 2k unless you want to show ID.

This is clearly illegal but I would love one.

If you are European contact them and express you would like to exercise your right to be forgotten and they will legally have to delete everything about you.
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:45:34
This is a bit misleading don't you think? Since 2017 the price has gone down significantly...

Not really any criminals in the trinity centre lad, just a junkie fest.
