No special agreements with the bank. I already have a business in my name and the appropriate contracts for using iDeal. I don't think it would be a problem if I just add the tax to the transactions. I just need to figure out how to build it.

The 890 seems a bit overkill, a 790 could also do it and is a bit cheaper.
And as far as I know the 5830 pull 500w each, wouldn't you need a second psu?

iDeal will be included, the fact that I couldn't buy Bitcoins with iDeal gave me the idea of creating my own exchange site :)

Sms is quite brilliant, will definitely be included! Will also take a look at the others.

There is a Linden Dollar to Bitcoin exchange somewhere. I think it's more likely to find someone who is willing to exchange VEB for Linden Dollars. You can then convert those to Bitcoins and the Bitcoins to USD. Quite a process and she'll probably lose money over it but it might be worth it.

No, not at all. I was mainly wondering if there was an economic or other cause.

Do you have a link yet? What payment options are you going to offer?
@_date: 2011-08-25 15:12:07
I have a bit of spare time and I'm willing to try. Send me a PM with info and I'll give it a shot.

Pretty easy. Generate a new public key for every order. This allows you to easily keep track of payments plus you can use it as an individual name so you know who to give download permissions.

The site is indeed not ready yet but I'm willing to convert cash to bitcoins already, pm me if you want to work something out.
