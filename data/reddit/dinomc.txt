From what I heard you just have to ignore this message and it will work with some credit cards.  
Doesn't work with mine (Visa from Banque Postale) but it did for a buddy of mine (Mastercard I think, from Crédit Agricole).
  
What I wanna know (@ RandomFrog) is : is there a way to link a french bank account to Circle? What do you put when it asks for a routing number?

So how much was it??

Nah, the price displays would change from XBT/USD to USD/XBT. So if the price goes from say, 3000 to 2000, it means you can buy LESS XBT with one dollar, so bitcoin price went up (by 50% in that case).  
  
Is they left it as XBT/USD the price would look something like : 0.0003333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333334  
so it's better to swap.

Yeah, a millionth is uBTC (microBTC) I think, mBTC being milliBTC (a thousandth)  
Well, this confusion is actually the reason we use "bits" now :P. Or so I heard

Yeah, he meant after the change once you are monitoring the price, you'll want the number to go down instead of up.  
  
But it'll be funny to suddenly have 1 million times more XBT too :)

Well, depends how much you have on your bitstamp account. Wouldn't risk losing several BTC (from getting banned because they thought changing your name was fishy or something, who knows) just to try to save $100 of passport fees.

They should at the very least disallow changing the domain.

I didn't know about this (especially since I use adblock) and had to download chrome on a new PC. Typed chrome on google, top ad url was  so I confidently downloaded from there. Got a virus :/ (then went back to check and noticed the wrong domain)  
They are really dumb to allow this.
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:16:20
Yeah, I like the idea and it could even get me to disable adblock if the ads are really clean and non intrusive. But I wouldn't change browser, I'd need this to be a chrome extension.

The sticky trying to explain the censorship has 75% of downvotes, how is that not a majority? Especially since he specified "participants"

I think that API field only works for "real" retweets using the RT button, not in this case (manual copy paste with "RT" in front). I assumed Changetip already ignored the real retweets.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:16:21
I guess a good way would be to parse twitter messages and ignore them if "RT" is present before " That's a very popular kind of pseudo-RT.
