He makes a good point with the steadiness. This is also how I picture it.

Wish I could be there. I remember Wout from the Illusion trance parties of many years ago.

Sincerely you have it all wrong. Such custodian solutions are necessary to attract more investors to bitcoin, and Bakkt is the best news of the year for our market.

It's currently sold at 5200 tobacco shops in France, out of the 25K total shops that could possibly offer this service. Still not bad.

As fungible as monero, impossible. But more fungible would be great.

This is why Monero was created.

Paypal’s rates are abusive. And it gets worse for smaller quantities. Of my own experience, about one dollar in fee for receiving 5 dollars. 
Sending and receiving BTC is so much cheaper, now that the transaction fees are low.

There’s also cryptocribs. It’s a bit like Airbnb but you pay and get paid in Bitcoin (a couple other currencies are also accepted). 
A few months ago, I published a room for short term rental in Barcelona (Spain) and I’ve already had quite a few bookings, including a repeat guest.
The extra income in crypto is always welcome, but what I enjoyed the most is being able to meet and hang out with other crypto enthusiasts from around the world. Great experience!!

The Moon used to be fairly good as a Youtube channel. Now it is a machine to promote bybit. He incites people to gamble with their money, and most of the rave comments in his channel do not look like they are genuine.

Monero is the most fungible of all cryptos.

You’re doing a great job with OpenBazaar, it’s a great market, and I’m looking forward to the Haven mobile app. It’s true the Bcash propaganda was out of place, but that is forgotten now. Would love to see Monero added to OB wallet.

Well documented article that sums it up pretty well, without taking bullish or bearish sides  
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:45:21
Sounds great. Looking forward to seeing your bikes on OB2!

Calling it “bitcoin core” lessens the credibility of this article. It’s Bitcoin.

That crap about BCH is unforgivable, unforgettable.

They are only coming back to Bitcoin because it now suits their interests, so much bad press about them. They should have embraced Segwit a long time ago, instead of trying to harm Bitcoin together with Roger Ver.

Very happy to hear that the PP takes this stance.

BTC could easily double its past ATH if Bitcoin ETFs happen this year... making those who sold now feel very bitter.
