Shitcoins are on the way out. Eth’s down 20%. I imagine any smart money is getting out to put into bitcoin.

This would be cool if any cryptocurrency besides bitcoin wasn’t pure garbage and won’t be replaced by a 2nd layer protocol on top of bitcoin in the next 5 years. But hey what do i know.

Bitcoin is a store of value at heart. Hence hodling. Its a place to store wealth that doesn’t deflate. If it put 1 million dollars in bank of america the government prints more money and i lose 3% of its value every single year. Bitcoin doing nothing gains as the mining reward goes down. Feel free to spend it as you would the usd but know that you’re basically being “the pizza guy”. And 10 years from now you’ll look back at the tv you bought and realize it could have funded your retirement forever.

I say we refer to how many moonlambo’s bitcoin is worth.

I just mean once the price fluctuations calm down a bit.  Lets say in 5-10years we’re at 500k/btc. If it doesn’t still wildly swing to 50% or 200% of its value and fullfill its original purpose of being a stable store of wealth then it wouldn’t make sense to convert it into any other currency except for day to day stuff for whatever country you live in. Even then if it holds enough in a bear market to still let you draw down for retirement why bother paying the large tax to pull it out and put it in the stock market with inflationary currency. I had a friend buy the majority of his at $200/btc and even during the last bottom of $4,000/btc he was still up 20x. I got in averaging 5k so if it goes to 225k like everyone is saying and falls to 100k in the next bear market im still up 20x as well.

Bigger blocksize = less nodes being run = centralization. 
Also bitcoin cash is shit.

@_date: 2019-06-24 16:56:07
See the problem is that when you sell to retire you convert to hyperinflated fiat AND you have to pay whatever government taxes on the amount you convert. I’ve thought about this a lot. If and when it stabilizes we may not have to pull anything besides day to day expenses out.
@_date: 2019-12-14 04:44:37
Bahahah what would give you that idea?
