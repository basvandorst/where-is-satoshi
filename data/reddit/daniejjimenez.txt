This is the reality: you do not live in dictatorship, it is good, you walk free, you think without censorship, there is no lack of public services, you earn in stable currency and you can fulfill your dreams if I had what you propose BUT do you like Socialism? You criticize Capitalism but you like dollars and the good life! And as if that weren't enough, you blame the United States for the drug traffickers that govern and impoverish the people ... Please be consistent ... the issue here in Venezuela is that there is hunger, misery, insecurity worse than in Africa or Syria and step the salary today is just $ 1 per month by the Government devalued the currency again in a thousand percent .. You start how to affect the manufacturing that seeks to have employees with decent living in BTC have now been expropriated because the Government does not suit for people to progress to control them with their crumbs

2020 FLETA Token + BTC = Profit! ������

Heavens if this is true, then you have to be careful in Korea where to put the funds .. less bad the token that I keep in my portfolio from KOREA «FLETA» is now listed in Bittrex in addition to GDAC and Bitsonic, in addition to that supported by CertiK..these theory give us a thought..paradoja: use personal wallets and not exchanges to store funds
