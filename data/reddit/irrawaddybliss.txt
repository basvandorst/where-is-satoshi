Yup, the system is called "Fedwire" run by the Federal Reserve. The sender normally pays ~$15-$30 as well as the receiver $10-$15, depending on the bank, but credit unions don't normally charge for these incoming wire transfers. There is also a privately owned system CHIPS, but the fees are the same.

too many intermediaries? I think it is pretty straightforward:
MyBankAccount(USD) -&gt; Coinbase (BTC)

that's nothing. I got two requests for 732342.34425 BTC and one for 999999.99999999 BTC. Where am I going to get ~$1 billion?!

If your large cash deposits were in the span of a few days, the bank normally assumes you are trying to "structure" your bank deposits to avoid a single $10K+ cash transaction that triggers a mandatory FinCEN's CTR filling. "Structuring" is illegal and violates a federal code. Banks are also required to file SAR ('suspicious activity report') on anyone they suspect of "structuring".

Perhaps Mr. Espinoza could argue in court that bitcoin is commodity; thus, btc sale doesn't require MT license.

Yup. Seems like a relatively old problem and well described by Bitpay

Generally, I believe in a free market system, but there is something to be said about the fact that one ~~fat~~ bad actor can hold the entire, decentralized community hostage.
