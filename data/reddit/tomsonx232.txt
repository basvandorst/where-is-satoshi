As a broad sweeping statement many people coming together to make an impact can sometimes be true.
But when it comes to buying and selling stocks that is not true at all.
60% of trades on the market are from HFT (High Frequency Trading), which is basically computers doing trades without any human interaction. Of the remaining 40% you need to take into account pension funds, hedge funds, investment banks, market makers, prop traders, corporations, private equity, mutual funds etc. and then you get down to the little guy, the individual investor.

How many bitcoins are 100 bits? Or fraction I guess

It sounds to me like he has quite of cash locked up in bitcoin and Apple's recent action of removing the last bitcoin wallet app (and this action subsequently making bitcoin fall in value) made him butthurt and he thinks that selling 100 shares will "stick it to them"

Why for the love of god why?
AAPL has a volume of 10,633,969 shares today, you selling your 100 shares did not affect the price even by a whole cent. This was a complete emotional response and not an investment decision.

I'll admit I am stereotyping a bunch of people in this sub, but that's because whenever I go on here there are countless posts about "Ahhh just a small bump in the road, invest for the long run!" or "BTX Just hit $X, I'm going in!" etc.
If you don't put in the research to adjust for the financial risks you take you will inevitable make a mistake where research would have save you money. I lost money this way in college when I traded in the stock market but couldn't put in the hours that was needed of the investments. I eventually bit the bullet and stopped trading, only after extending my losses beyond what they needed to be.
This is what I'm trying to warn against.

Stop re-framing China's banning of bitcoin as a positive thing.

Just because it's hard to research something doesn't excuse you from doing the research.
In fact it gives you more of a reason to do research because it will be easier to get an informational edge.

How? Don't list off the benefits of bitcoin I know them already. I want to know exactly how you came to that conclusion. Where are your financial models? What numbers have you crunched?

If you got offended by that comment then I'm willing to bet he got offended by that comment.
The crux of the insult was using sophisticated language with a mature tone until I reach the peak of my prose and use the most offensive, immature words to catch the reader off guard.
In closing: die cis scum

If you are using bitcoin as a way of gambling then sure.
But don't tell yourself you know how the dice is going to roll when you don't is what I'm saying.

I don't have any bitcoins. Actually I might have fractions of pennies worth when I tried mining them 6 months ago, would have cost more to pay for the electricity than mine them so I stopped after 2 hours or so.

That quote by Warren Buffett is being very misused. Yes the stock market (and markets in general) can overreact to certain events but this is not an overreaction at all.
Think about the value of the Euro, now think about what the value of the Euro would be if only Spain used the Euro and all the other economies for the Euro (France, Germany, Italy etc etc.) used their own currency. The value of the Euro would drop heavily in that situation because the usefulness of it is a fraction of what it was before.
Bitcoin is similar in this situation but instead of a country by country, economy by economy scale it's on a website by website scale. And to use the metaphor further you guys just lost France, Italy, Germany, and Spain all at once.
The only way that Bitcoin will generate value in the future is if you can use it in more and more places, but even then Bitcoin is not stable enough to be a facilitation of currency. The fact that the value of Bitcoins inflated from $46.74 March 16, 2013 (start of Cyprus Bank run) to $229 April 9, 2013 (when Cypriots started to exchange Bitcoins back to the Euro) all due to one small island nation is proof enough that Bitcoins are not a stable currency for the demands of a global economy.

I'm sorry I have a moral objection to just standing by and seeing all the people making posts about investing their fortunes without doing even 20 hours of market research.
In retrospect: Blow me faggot.

Dear god, buddah, jesus christ, and whole grain cereal.
Look, if I offended anybody by using the word "Fagg*t" then I am sorry, that was not meant for you. I believe in gay rights and have several friends who are openly gay, I could list all the reasons why I didn't mean offense for using that word but I honestly don't have the time, this is the internet, nobody would care about my reasons.
Can we stop derailing this? Pretty please?

If I told people to buy and people acted on it I would lose thousands of people money, if I told people to sell and people acted on it I would lose thousands of people money.
I am just telling people to stop, and take a level headed look at what they are doing.

Ah I see, thought that was a balance checker or something. Thanks!
