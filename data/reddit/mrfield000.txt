The Relayed by IP address is 134.129.23.124 and it happened at 2014-01-03 14:45:09 and was sent to address 1HmVdtqSxEReh4GVqLbSsgH7YArQb8xGq4
This is super lame. How in the world is Bitcoing going to become legitimate if hackers can hack away and steal wallets? It's like the wild west in the 1800's

Nope no AV on the machine. Thanks for the URL. I followed and downloaded EasyFind and haven't been able to find any keylogger files.

Nope. When I repurchase the coins, I'll be taking them offline and storing them in a paper wallet. Take a look at this post:  Hope it helps!

I was on a Mac and access my emails via Mac Mail.

Don't think that's possible. It relays to North Dakota State University Computer Center

Nope only used it on my desktop.

Appreciate the condolences. If you have a keylogger tool for Mac, let me know. I'm trying to eliminate all possibilities. Thanks.

Fantastic idea, I just sent Dropbox an email. Cheers for your assistance.

I backed up and stored my wallet on Dropbox. Thanks for the tip on wireshark, I'm going to try that now.

Appreciate the comment DaddyNumberOne. Hope it helps you not make the same mistake as me. And if it ends up saving you and others from losing their coins, then some good will come of this. All the best.

Couldn't find anything suspicious following your Gmail suggestion. Next stop - trying to find malware or keylogging trojans. If you have a suggestion for Mac, let me know. Cheers.

Crap didn't think I had to go to that extent. Is there a software you would recommend that can identify and disable malware? Appreciate the thoughts from a senior Applecare advisor.
