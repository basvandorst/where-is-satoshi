Coinbase or coinbase (also try to remember where you bought them i might be a hint)

Yes, BTC blockchain has “logs”.

The number "20020801" looks like a date, but when we start from bottom right, it is a coordinate to another number "19981101" but I think that this is not intentional. But still tho I didn't find those dates in the whitepaper.

And the banking system is still not overthrown... ghh

Why would he do this?
@_date: 2018-05-20 07:40:37
Of course...

No. Bitcoins are issued in a way where Satoshi in disguise posts an image with words in random order and tells users to solve it.

Did you generate the wallet with the exact address that has funds stored on?
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:33:36


If I am not mistaken, Electrum or other wallet use\(d\) 12 word seeds. And since this is a multi\-signature wallet I guess that could be words to both signing wallets. Good find!

They still weren't moved... why do u think so?
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:04:50
If you were smart, the funds would be moved already...
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:29:49
Check the addresses then. Don’t you realize how much possible seeds there are?

I invested 70$ when parents gave me some money to bitcoin like a month ago on my 16th birthday, too. It is 140$ now.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:18:42
Because it could look that I am desperately asking for it.  Similar post was posted where a guy offered 50$ to a 16yo who was posting his investment. I did not want to look like I just want to get some BTC
Or, is it bad to show a reminder that I don't want money?
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:20:54
I would bruteforce it. 950 BTC is so much money to just don't try to bruteforce or look up seed somewhere stored on that HDD.

No, you maybe wont become an airplane owner by 2020 but u still can gain yourself some good profit, i bought around 30 mBTC for 85 $ and now, 3 weeks later, i am 20 $ in profit. That is around 25 % profit In only 3 weeks. Go get you some mBTC and be a long-time holder. As said, best time for buy was in 2009, the second best time is now.

Thank you. I actually thought about Mission Impossible.

We still don't sleep because we check price every 5 minutes.

We should look at gmx.com user agreement or faq. Maybe they even made an exception for him because they probably know who and how important he is.

Did not heard of that before.. got source from where it came from?
