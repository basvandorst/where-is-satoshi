Sounds like some banks do this more than others. It’s aweful how they condition us to be babies.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:10:13
Every time though?!? Seems excessive.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:40:38
So let me get this straight. You have to call the bank each time and ask for permission to use your own money?
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:34:51
Sure, the issuing bank or cc company will most likely refund the amount if you make the claim. You’ll need to file a police report first. But they aren’t going to pursue that any further.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:36:01
I agree those systems exist but I have a very strong feeling there’s also a black/grey list and Coinbase is listed
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:04:07
Good point. I forgot that cc payments don’t settle for something like 30 to 90 days.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:31:52
Do you have some data to back that up?
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:45:09
People are probably using stolen CC to buy crypto online but I doubt they are doing it on Coinbase though.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:05:28
I’m assuming people have gotten hacked for [insert good or service].
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:07:27
OP was using Coinbase not some sketchy site though. You don’t think at this point WF knows about the largest crypto exchange in NA?
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:00:51
The bank never recovers cc fraud. That’s why cc rates are 24.49% APR. Fraud, default, delinquency is baked* into the rate.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:14:16
It has little security online because it’s not a native digital currency like bitcoin. The network created by banks is awful.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:14:25
That’s rich, Wells Fargo doesn’t want a thief taking my money because then there would be nothing to steal for them.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:13:15
Yes but it’s a highly liquid, on demand loan, which can ‘mature’ at any point you decide to withdraw.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:29:36
That doesn’t sound too bad.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:11:56
Really, why don’t they do the same thing with every online purchase then? Seems just as likely to me that someone can find your card and use it for ecommerce.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:25:50
No they don’t because it would take too much effort to recover $1000 or more. They assume there will be some fraud and write it off.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:28:33
They don’t legally pursue and consumer fraud. You think they’d use their legal team or lawyers on retainer to pursue a $10,000 charge. It would take months or a year and the cost would be so damn high. That’s not how banks operate. The interest rate on your card assumes a certain level of fraud, default, etc. that’s why 24% whereas an auto loan or mortgage have lower rates.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:31:10
You’re getting it ��
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:10:39
Take my upvote for CU’s
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:38:27
Thanks for sharing and it does sound very credible how this system works. I had doubts that Coinbase specifically had a high score in terms of stolen credit card use.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:39:34
I appreciate your opinion and gave you an upvote.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:09:50
Blah blah. They have an agenda, specifically WF but also HSBC, and the will make sure there’s maximum friction every time you want to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:02:19
There are definitely situations like the one you provided. But making a $100 on Coinbase triggers fraud as well?
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:15:39
Does the bank have any recourse for just about any consumer good you buy though? Name one.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:21:52
Wow such buzzwords. Some human made a decision to include Coinbase on that list which I’m pointing out should not be there.
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:59:25
Bank: “you are stupid and we have to make it hard to use your money for your protection.”
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:47:41
I agree with what you’re saying. Blocking a purchase on Coinbase though?  That would be like blocking a transfer to Fidelity or Schwab account.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:08:08
Should the bank assess every online purchase you make then?
@_date: 2019-03-05 10:01:04
Every exchange, merchant, individual doing KYC is ludicrous especially when compared to how relaxed it is outside of crypto.  Are there no solutions on the horizon?
@_date: 2019-03-23 06:20:00
Let’s pump education not price
@_date: 2019-03-01 17:18:54
I get fungibility and the importance of privacy especially at the protocol layer. I just didn’t get OPs comment and my understanding was that he was referring to money laundering via fiat as that was the title in the article.
Also, I conflated with money laundering with money printing for a second, hence the limited supply response.
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:52:30
It’s the punch up strategy. Maybe a marketer can explain it better. Market leader doesn’t stoop down, but competitors always try to punch up.

Ok but aren’t people advocating for custodial LN wallets for mass adoption to work?
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:11:31
I agreed with your original comment on it being dumb to burn your BCH. If OP didn’t like it, he can accomplish same thing by selling BCH for BTC.
I really don’t know how LN will turn out, I have my doubts but it seems like there’s progress being made albeit very slow. I’m reserving my judgement as privacy and decentralization are both very important for me to see in a cc.
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:51:10
It’s all relative and US is still open to innovation and new technologies. Others aren’t.
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:53:52
Or buy BTC and accomplish the same exact thing but better
@_date: 2019-03-01 10:21:53
Care to explain?
@_date: 2019-03-16 21:03:50
Wash trades?
@_date: 2019-03-01 07:49:10
Wouldn’t it be an attack store of value as it undermines limited supply attribute?
@_date: 2019-03-18 10:56:19
This is a great video on explaining blockchain very plainly. However, what really did it for me was Andreases talks. He was the only one of two dozen other speakers I've listened talk about the gravity of Bitcoin that had it click for me.
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:54:43
Wow, this is the limp liberal strategy y'all are going for. When has virtue signal boycotting ever worked? Name me one instance please. I want to be proven wrong here.

Have you heard of the term 'economists have predicted 11 of the last 3 recessions? First of all, you don't know how rich he is. Second of all, all his wealth is from collecting salary for a psuedo-governmental organ (Unis). If he was so good at making 'predictions' then he should be a billionaire. Finally, teaching econ in college does more harm than good.
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:04:16
He's an economist which makes him the worst type of charlatan there is. A BS vendor. Read David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs.
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:22:25
So 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:57:48
This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:24:32
This is different from what I read, can you link to a source?
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:22:44
No he's not. This guy is no different than what Paul Krugman was to the internet, at one point predicting that it would have no more impact on the economy than a fax machine. Economist like this guy say SO MUCH FUCKING SHIT because they don't have real jobs. And then years later, they cherry pick the correct predictions and ignore or spin the false ones.
This is in contrast to investors/speculators/traders who have a P&amp;L and live and die by their trades/actions.

Buy 1 bitcoin and then fork the entire network
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:05:46
Really?! then why are people still calling for them to be boycotted if they already have segwit?
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:32:48
Actually, that's right. It seems in this instance the best you can do is boycott them but I get tired of browsing this sub and seeing a whole bunch of 'boycott this exchange, boycott this wallet'. It gets old and I don't think it's effective the way OP is doing it.
Also, children working in a factory is a symptom of a poor society. Children have worked either on farms or in their parents shops since the dawn of civs.
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:00:00
If r/buttcoin was a person, it would be this guy.
Thank you OP for the reminder of why all economists are BS vendors.
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:24:55
Well, miners are a centralized business now days so why would they if BCH is not profitable?
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:53:11
Debit is not your money. Deposits in a bank is a loan to the bank. Of course the maturity date on a checking account in theory is whenever you want it.
Whereas credit is a loan to you and thus your money which you owe back to the lender on the terms you agreed on.
So to recap, debit is you cancelling the loan you made to the bank and credit is the bank giving you a loan/cash.
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:57:39
I wasn't around back then but from what I read there was like 80% consensus on SW2x. Small blockers get SegWit and big blockers get 2mb.
Obviously this is a hypothetical but if that deal went through SegWit adoption would be above the measly 30% it is 2 years on.

Non monetary assets are inflation hedges. If there’s hyper inflation, then the cost of say a house rises in proportion.
When you look back at a house 30 years ago you might get the impression that the price doubled or tripled but adjusted for inflation, real growth is anemic.
I agree that bitcoin is a good bet when petrodollar weakens but it is not the only safe haven like you’re making it out to be.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:41:24
Wrong. There are non-monetary assets. Real Estate, Gold, Equity, etc.

There would obviously be controls and best practices in place. Segregation of duties that create checks and balances so that one person doesn’t have unilateral access to vital areas.
