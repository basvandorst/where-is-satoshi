When you go into a village in Kenya today you'll find no landlines, no banks and no ATMs.
What you *will* find are people charging their Chinese cellphones with the neighbor's generator, micropayment services and use of Facebook in lieu of texting because it's cheaper.
Once consumer-grade phones on the African market are advanced enough to support QR scanning digital currencies are likely to spread like wildfire.

...your political alignment follows a weekly schedule?
Well, to be fair that's not unlike that of many candidates, US and otherwise.

Oh haha, nice. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:09:05
I don't follow. Please explain.

Soon you'll be paying for the snacks with Bitcoin. ...or not, because those are horribly overpriced things.
It is a wonderful time to be alive.

You could, but it's hella illegal and once it comes out it's gonna be a massive shitstorm. 
TL;DR: You could, but you shouldn't.

Oh well. How do they say? Any kind of publicity is good publicity. For you.
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:21:47
...oh welp. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 02:35:32
23andme got the hammer? For what? Also, cheers. I'd be happy to hear what they found out. Bitcoin is like nature; It always finds a way.
@_date: 2015-04-01 09:36:54
Thanks for the answer; I'll be following your developments!!
@_date: 2015-04-01 09:36:13
Oh, that might be an interesting function as well. Thanks for the information!

Can't wait for things to sorta degenerate into a barter economy if this goes on for too long.

Pretty dope.
The future is looking bright.

A few years ago Bitcoin was only seen as a novelty project by *those crazy nerds*.
A few years later it became the currency of the underworld, shamed and despised.
Today, it's gone global, a market like yet unlike any other. No longer a laughable endeavor to be derided or a secretive payment system for the criminal element but an asset to be respected.
We've come far, and I look forward to where this journey leads from here on out.
Thank you, CoinCandence.

This hype cannot be contained! Really happy to see adaptation is making progress in leaps and bounds. *We can and* are *winning this*.

What I really hope for next is that Sony, Valve and Microsoft get involved. Once Bitcoin becomes "plugged into" gaming it will be nearly impossible to think of digital culture without it.
Didn't PayPal send out feelers recently too?

Can you pay with directly with BTC as well? That's what I'm mostly interested in, myself.

Probably harder to find one than to pay for one. Selling wetwork seems to be one of those things nobody of proper skill WANTS a free market evaluation for.
Best to just be involved in ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''robberies gone wrong''''''''''''''''''''''''' and sudden bouts of depression whenever someone gets found out to have helped Wikileaks. :D
