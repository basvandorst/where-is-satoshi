There will never be a ban, never! Don't believe in fud. A government which bans the greatest innovation of the last years, would be like a government which tries to ban internet - a joke. South Korea would give its current state of being a crypto melting pot not away to other countries like China or Japan. Never.

It's well understood. But as gov, you would just support the biggest, uncontrolled, growing black market, without getting any taxes from. This would be the same to ban cannabis trading. Governments did this for years, until they realised, that they lose a lot of money to the underground markets.

Actually there is a bank crisis going on right now. It's actually worse than 2008. This time the tax payers would go crazy if it would officially announced so it's better not to make announcements like this. The banks took all the money in the last crisis, fucked up again and now they are just not officially announce that they are in trouble again. Imho we are going to see a big banking collapse again.

I'm posting this everytime on Raspi posts as a friendly reminder: you can download and progress the entire Blockchain on your fast PC and transfer it to the Raspi external HDD. This saves around 5 days of downloading and hiccups on your Raspi. 
Install bitcoin core on your PC, activate TXindex (that's important) and let it download and progress on your PC in about 12hrs or less... Depending on your connection speed.
(Torrent downloading the Blockchain makes no sense as it is not faster and it is not safe)
Other people have posted, that lnd also works with pruned nodes. 
Start your node today!
Btw: you could also recycle the Blockchain from your PC to create some nodes for your friends and family. That'd save even more days! Xmas is coming!
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:28:26

You can, but right now you'd have to manually restart lnd after IP change to reconnect to nodes. This is something which will be soon happen automatically. There is already an option 'nat' that should take care of this in lnd, it's not perfectly working on my end so far, but I am pretty sure it will soon. Currently I stop land, restart and unlock the wallet and everything is reconnected.

Not important. ETFs are just Banker and stock market toys. They would push the price short, because of news coverage, but it would bring more volatility to bitcoin as you could easier bet on BTC - without owning them. It's nice without them...

How ignorant can you be. Tell the journalists, the opposition about it. He puts people with different opinions into prison, turns off every regime critique newspaper or TV channel. He completely controls the media, censors the internet... What else do you need as a proof? The coup was staged and so is the whole economy. Turkey will have a big problem with this guy. This will not end well if he will win the next "election". He is the worst for Turkey.

Just as simple example: As you can track bitcoin tx you would be able to track money flow. Let's say there is a fundraising for a specific topic. The money gets sent to that specific official address - there is no way, the money could be spent untracked for instance. And if money is leaving the address to an unknown address, you could see if someone is using it for a non official case. So would directly know if the money is spent for the one purpose or not.
And in the future with lightning, you could also use independent witnesses to digitally sign transactions. There are so many ways to use the technology... It's amazing.

I don't like this guy at all, and I think he's a big scammer - but what he said, was, that Africa should take care of their own stuff instead of hoping for investors from all over the world - because they would only invest to grab everything they can.

Make sure to read and learn more about bitcoin. You are looking for an exchange, not a wallet. Be careful and never buy from strangers online! Never use PayPal for bitcoin buys. Never tell strangers anything about your parent's jobs online. Bitcoin.org is a good starting point.
There are a lot of scammers out there, waiting to fool newcomers.
Edit: Mining bitcoin with computers is not possible for any longer. Maybe vertcoin (GPU mining is still possible, vertcoin.org).  Bitcoin wallets are free and you don't need a specific age. There are plenty out there.

Banning bitcoin is impossible, making it hard to use is. If China really comes up with an own cryptocurrency, they won't be interested in having a decentralised competitor.

No, it's not a technical problem. Of course visa has a lot of Datacenters. But who is in charge and controls them? It's one company which can decide to stop services at any time - e.g. by getting forced from a government or because you are not supporting a special party, or you are Julian Assange or Edward Snowden or a citizen in a country with an us embargo. Bitcoin can't get forced, closed or manipulated by a government. Sure, miners in China could get shut down, but then there will other miners to start. There is no bitcoin company, no CEO, no country contract. That's what decentralised means.
With bitcoin you just need a piece of software and internet connection and you can receive and send money, and nobody can stop you from doing so.

It won't solve any problems as long it is controlled by governments. Let's say Facebook is forbidden in a country - using it is illegal - how can this coin solve a problem? It's a centralised, controlled stable coin, traceable and works like a token you can buy for us dollars.

Mark: "For the same reason people are using WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus or Facebook,  because it's easy to use. They are dumb, stupid and lazy fucks."
Actually it's very good for bitcoin, when the lazy masses get confronted with the Facebook shitcoin. Hopefully a few people start thinking? I mean, there just need to be one scandal and this shitcoin thing can blow up. This time, it's about people's money - they now really see and feel it, when something goes wrong. Data scandal is way too abstract for many users and they don't care. This coin project by FB can be very bad for their business. They start playing with people's money - the hottest asset in a capitalist world. This coin makes FB vulnerable.

Depends where you live. You could use an exchange. If you are in Europe is quite simple. Maybe there is an ATM around at your area? Don't buy bitcoin via PayPal though.
If you want to buy from strangers, be double careful. Like mentioned here before, the owner could sign a message to verify - but that doesn't mean he will send them to you... trusted Exchanges are the best for beginners.

@_date: 2019-02-01 13:30:07
I'm not saying that you are wrong. The problem is way deeper than that. Cryptography is important. Cryptos are the tip of the iceberg. If you want people to use cryptos and understand why they are important, they need to understand why privacy is important. And that's the problem I see: young people are more and more getting the impression that they need to show everything to the world and it is hard to make them understand why privacy matters. Tell a 10 year old kid, that they shouldn't use WhatsApp or Instagram, Snapchat - they will laugh at you. They need to be educated.

While I can understand authorities on an airport, that carrying 50,000 bucks in cash can be a bit suspicious - it's funny that having 1million+ on a bank account is not even questioned - or driving a super expensive car or owning a million dollar mansion.  The opposite is the case - a lot of people begin to treat you very friendly, nobody asks where the money comes from. Stupid world. So yeah, everybody should be able to carry as much money. Or start questioning the super rich, where the money came from...

Cryptography cannot become insecure. Cryptography will always have the same power to encrypt like there is power to decrypt.

Before you telling people they are fools, calm down a bit and educate yourself. You have no idea about how banks are working so it seems. Of course I can find out how much money is on your bank account - just imagine I would work for another credit institute or a insurance company, or the police. There is no problem to find out everything about you and your whole family. Bitcoin is not private per se - that is true, when you use it wrong. You can of course protect your wallet from anybody knowing what is inside by using multiple addresses - addresses are not representing your wallet and therefore they don't tell anybody what is inside your main HD wallet. Even the best cryptography cannot protect your privacy if you are using it wrong.
So, I hope you calm down a bit and just relax. And reread how bitcoin actually works.

This time killed by BCH.
BCH gang pushed the price of bitcoin for weeks because of a fork that was never going to happen: 2x. BTG was a test.
Just to transfer the money out now to bitcoin cash - to show that people want their coin over bitcoin and to spread fud.
It is manipulated from some big players. Just let them do their thing. Don't fall for it. No, not big companies are leaving bitcoin and shifting to bch. It's the mighty bch gang.
Bitcoin is dead.

You are not wrong, at least about the keys. But at least more people can join the party. Just imagine, you won't need a Bankaccount, but you can send a company bitcoin even they have no idea how to take care of it - so they first need to trust the bank. If they care, they can change their system. And this is new. Also it is great for me competition in development. Education is needed, so people won't need Banks. What else would be the next logical step in your opinion, to bring BTC to the masses?
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:14:23

Absolutely not. Lightning has a lot of potential and even in its early stage it's already fantastic. Also, lightning does not replace bitcoin. It enhances the ability to use it.

I posted about this yesterday here and it was deleted as it was flagged as 'off topic'.

They are going to deconstruct themselves. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:38:39
I just cheer it up as good news, because bitcoin can reach a wider range of audience. Nobody needs to use their service. I agree with you - giving away user data, was kind of unprofessionally treated and they should have waited for a court to decide. 
But as long as it is necessary, to have a bank license, to officially put ATMs out there in Germany, it's not the worst step. Also, you never know, which information are collected and given to whom when you are using any bitcoin ATM somewhere. 
So, yes, being sceptical is good. But mainstream adoption won't happen quicker when people cannot actually buy bitcoin on ATMs without to register.

u/shesek1 I've a question: 
From a technical pov is it completely impossible to get protected content without paying? Not hidden in js, no way to reverse engineering it   to get the content? Here the question: What happens when one person pays 1 cent and shares his link - maybe to a big database of tokens? Can somebody else use this link to get the content? I'm asking, because if this would be the case, it might be similar to adblockers which block specific addresses, but here to remove the lightning paywall with the token. 
Example: Bob pays for an article on a website, gets the content and the link to read the content later, too without repaying the fee.
Bob has a lot of friends on Reddit and shares his link with them to read the article over his token link.
Now Alice can read the content without paying.
Or is there a hash in the token link, which prevents from using the token link on another machine? I guess saving the IP address wouldn't be a way to go here.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:23:17

Sadly the yellow vest protests could be fired up by right wing people to change the system and to  let le Pen win the next election. I would be very careful with jumping on this protest - it'll be used in the next elections against democracy. Russia today is involved, breitbart., Etc. Especially young people are triggered to go on the streets against Macron and against the 'system'. Think about who will win by bringing up the people against the more left party. Macron needs to fix the problems the conservative party left over. I'm not saying he's a good or bad president - just be careful and look close to see what's going on with those protests. It's obvious, that right wing parties gain more and more power. USA, Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Brazil, Germany, etc. 
To use Jeanne d'Arc as the leader of the neo revolution is maybe a little bit strange. It's not the revolution - it's the evolution of the right wing.
My two satoshis. The best way to gain power is to make the people belief that everything is fucked up. It's not getting better when right people gain more power. It's dangerous. Same shit happened in Germany after ww1. People were unsatisfied with the situation - and then the 'great leader' just came up in the right moment... And we all know what this led to.

Uber uses people (and cars) without giving them insurance or any social benefits. Sadly the advantages over Uber are just superficial. And most driver seem to not understand this.
The idea of using shared driving is of course good though... But Uber is not paying enough to the driver. So I see what OP wants to express, but it's not a good comparison when you really look closely.
It's more like asking a postman about the advantages of email...

It's always dangerous to 'convince' someone. The risk is pretty high for people who don't understand the whole thing. It must be very clear, that you can lose everything - due to wrong handling more likely than bitcoin going to zero. You could start with ATM or depending on your country a portal like bittrex.com or bitcoin.de (Europe).
Only invest what you are willing to lose. Don't keep big amounts on exchanges. Learn about the tech and don't gamble. Buy BTC and hodl. Don't look back. Good luck.

ok  here is a quick overview what got ruined for them in specific (please also check other news sources):
So, what got ruined for Muslims is trust - people were not longer allowed to enter the country because of their religion:
What happened to native americans?: Here you go: [
What happened to minorities - for instance mexicans:
and with this the power to bash mexican people in the USA.
Something that got ruined for the environment:

I have the feeling, that a big part of the Friday for future movement for example thinks that bitcoin is a problem for climate - as there are plenty of misleading articles out there. Most articles just claim the 'enormous energy consumption' without putting it in comparison with the banking industry (printing money, infrastructure, employees, security, ATM, etc.) - there is lack of knowledge that should be fixed. Energy is also not the problem nowadays - we have plenty of it already from renewable energy sources, that is wasted when not consumed....

Or he enabled a market, where everyone who wanted or needed drugs, got them without going to a dealer on the streets. You cannot stop drug dealing - so silk road just took the street criminality off the streets. Another way would be to legalise more drugs, so people won't need to do illegal stuff to get them and the state would also get taxes and could control the quality...

How is this legal from their point of view?
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:52:05
There are still hundreds of silk roads online. Why are there drug dealers? Right, because people want drugs that they cannot buy legally. So they are forced to go to someone who sells them. This is bad in many ways, as gang wars happen, weapons are maybe involved, money laundering, neighborhood gets into ghetto, etc. 
With something like silk road you had this problem taken off the streets.
Just saying 'drug dealers' are bad is not a solution but your opinion. If the government is not going to make the use controlled possible, people find a way and you can't do anything against it. 


So does the 'legal' tax money. 
Let me add this, I'm also critically about all this. But that doesn't mean, I just look at it from one side. I can understand your points - but it's not that easy.

You cannot kill bitcoin. So they try to kill the weak hands and buy exactly then, when you sold. It's a sad game when you sell your precious 5btc to make ten out of them, just to realise, that the price already is double the price you have sold them for - so you made 2.5btc out of your 5btc - they want you to bet. I learned my lesson once. Be careful.

Sadly the situation in France is influenced by right wing media. People don't get it yet. LePen laughs out loud. Macron is not the problem - it's the picture media  (Facebook User with no sources, fake Twitter accounts, right news, Russia Today ) draws. People fall for it as they are fed with false statements and wrong information. Russia Today is big with this and Keiser is on Russia Today a little bit too much. IMHO. I'm not saying that Russia is a bad actor per se - but someone will have advantages with this current situation and sadly that will be the right wing. 'make France big again. Revolution!' - that's what's going on. You see it over the place in the world. Germany, USA, Italy, France, Brasil, Hungary, are just a few, where the right is rising again.  
Turkey and Russia using this situation to blame Europe for violence against the people. While they are not allowing demonstrations in their countries entirely. They have media stations running 24hrs telling about the problems in Europe, while western media are 'terrorists' in their country and are highly under pressure. That's populism par excellence. Keep that in mind.

You will instantly be part of the network and you can use it, open channels, fund them. Make the network more stable and reliable. Try it out. If you have more questions, just ask!

Maybe 2800 is the bottom. But I wouldn't dance with the whales. Also 1btc is worth 1btc. So just relax and chill out.

They will just use a 10$ wrench then. ;)
But for real, I think it's good to have this option.

Haha. That was a good one.

Pretty sure there will be a solution for this in the future.

This is exactly the opposite of bitcoin. It's a bullshit centralised stable coin. I just posted it to show what this secret "bitcoin rival" project was about and how uneducated media is writing about it.
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:09:36
If you haven't sold you lost nothing. You'll understand when BTC is 30k.

I hate CNBC. They always try to manipulate and they hardly promoted bcash.

For those there'll be bitcoin banks for them in the future :)..

I like this. I also accept bitcoin on my website. Although nobody has paid me ever in bitcoin, it's a statement everyone should at least express! That's what you can do for your business and for bitcoin: accept it!

It's not comparable to bitcoin at all. It's just a like a credit you need to buy with fiat. Like you can buy Xbox credits. It has nothing to do with a crypto currency. It's just to fool the masses once again.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:27:09
Bitcoin value hasn't dropped. It's still worth 1 BTC. What value are you talking about? The dollar?! It's worth negative.
