jus curious, why would I choose Luno over Paxful or Paxful over Luno?

hello, I don't have a bank account which is why I'm looking at some OTC options, thanks for the tip though

I gave Paxful a try amidst a handful of bad reviews, compared it to Kraken, suprisingly, Paxful works for me better since it's peer-to-peer! quick and easy!

hey, guys, already cash out via OTC - Luno has a great app but customer support is another story, so I gave Paxful a try, they don't have a mobile app yet, but their platform is pretty easy to use, you can easily find a seller then cash out at a nearby WU outlet, also, Paxful's customer support is very accommodating in answering questions, great stuff

Is it any good compared to Paxful or Luno?

The internet deserves a native currency? I guess what the internet needs is more P2P Finance Platforms since it's more open compared to exchanges.

I was on vacation in Kenya, and was traveling with my pet pony and needed cash to buy some pet pony stuff like food and meds, Paypal wasn't available, Paxful allowed me to cash out at WU with some tips from their customer support, thanks Paxful!

Good to hear Paxful is leading the charge for the P2P Financial Revolution in South Africa. Their customer support agents are always available to attend to your queries and complaints. :)
