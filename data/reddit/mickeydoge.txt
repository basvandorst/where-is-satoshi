I must ask, did you ever actually get it to the point where you entered an addy and it said withdrawn? Or did you never even get to the address screen?
How long has this thing been being crap for?
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:41:50
While you have some good points, overall I disagree. A tip is the equivalent of an upvote except you get real money.
IDK about you, but if I make something interesting I'd rather have a bunch of people give me penny fractions than stupid useless internet points. 
Oh... I don't even think its possible to tip $0.001 USD.
All said though I do like Dogetipbot MUUCH better than ChangeTip because it is more reliable and really fast confirmation times for withdrawing and depositing.
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:11:33
Is gambling stupid? Yes. I've learned already.
Is it a fake site because you lost a 90% bet. No... Use logic pls.
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:24:20
Don't encourage the troll. Probably butthurt cause he bought at $1200.
@_date: 2014-12-17 03:46:04
It has a very lightweight blockchain sync so you shouldn't have to wait for much.
Enable a password on your wallet to protect your coins.
Other than that, just normal bitcoin wallet stuff.
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:07:13
You misunderstood. Of course I know that.
I just wanted to heat a small amount of water. As in, less than 10 mL. For fun. As a project. Also, I think USB stick miners are fascinating and need an excuse to buy one since I can't convince myself to get one instead of just buying BTC if they are so unprofitable.
With the water boiler idea, I can.
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:27:46
Kinda sounded like you implied it. But OK.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:46:22
Awesome, messaging you now!
@_date: 2014-12-01 04:33:37
Awesome, thank you! I will be sure to check it out as soon as I can!
100 bits @_date: 2014-12-16 02:34:41
If a Block Eruptor transferred its produced heat to the water at 100% efficiency (assuming no loss to air) you would boil 10 grams in 27 minutes.
Of course, you DO lose heat to air :P
@_date: 2014-12-30 03:21:31
Seems... legit....
Can you give proof please? Just seems awful fishy. New account? Seems even more legit.
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:37:31
Don't trust ANYONE'S price predictions. They know nothing. Someone posted a list of 50 people's predictions for end of 2014 and they were ALL WRONG.
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:25:15
I honestly wish people would use mBTC instead of bits as the standard unit. Much easier to follow.
Also, when the heck did people start calling them bits instead of uBTC? I kind of took a break from Bitcoin related things from February to November and now people call them bits. Isn't uBTC more logical?
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:10:10
Repost? I cn try.
@_date: 2014-12-05 15:44:31
Possibly. Possibly not. Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:21:17
Seems legit. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:12:45
Yep. Real money. Nobody controls it either. And it's legal.
If you absolutely must you can cash it out for USD. But you could just spend it online.
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:06:18
I got it to the withdraw screen, entered my addy, and submitted. No issues but nothing to my addy and I cant reopen withdraw or the page now.
What a messed up site! If I end up getting it I will make sure to send your .2.
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:42:01
Just a thought, try a different amount of BTC? Could work.
@_date: 2014-12-17 01:30:16
They take half of it for fees so it's really like a 5GHS one.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:50:44
Thanks for the tip. Lots of Watts too, better for water heating purposes :)
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:21:14
I use multibit and I love it. Extremely fast sync times and works well for everything.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:13:18
Yeah PayPal sucks compared to Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.  
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:07:47
Merry Christmas
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:32:42
Pretty much, although that usb will make a little less than that.
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:29:58
Yeeah... I'm not really a fan.
mBTC is around 30 cents right now. It is easy to do math for in your head.
@_date: 2014-12-30 03:29:05
Thanks for being on top of it! :)
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:04:19
Welcome new members! Ask if you need anything answered.
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:27:58
Won't profit off that. It is way too expensive. If it was $5, I'd say get it for fun buy $80?! No.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:17:38
LOL. People need to stop trying to make predictions to console themselves that they are going to be rich and just use the technology.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:11:25
Can someone explain what the heck Ripple is?
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:32:49
What are sidechains?
@_date: 2014-12-16 03:06:09
Not me, sorry. Try Bitcointalk service forums?
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:47:16
Uhh, maybe for M7M CPU mining.
Or you could set up a USB Mining rig attached to one. I'm doing that soon.
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:33:21
You are gonna have to earn it by doing jobs online.
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:46:11
How'd you get that?
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:30:18
I found posts that say Satoshicircle has been "dead in the water" (that's the only description I could find) since at least November 15. I have also tried, many times, to withdraw and have been unable to.
I think you may be out of luck :( I will try one more time tomorrow before giving up.
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:00:35
Not all certainly, but it is sadly common in many schools.
@_date: 2014-12-10 05:59:17
I just only have a few hundred dollars in BTC and not sure it's worth the investment.
Does look neat though!
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:07:28
February 2014, what Bitcoin will be at next 12 months.
All are wrong. Ha.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:07:44
Ebay, or amazon. Whichever is cheaper. Keep in mind you will never make ROI, but they do mine a little bit of BTC every day. I recommend going with the Antminer U1 as it is still nice and flat but clocks in 6x faster than the Block erupter. Don't buy for more than $20. You won't make your money back anyway so keep it cheap.
But fun to use! I call it my money printing machine :P
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:30:41
That would be in another subreddit. Dogecoin and Litecoin just used to be the best coins for mining. Now they are only slightly more profitable than Bitcoin due to ASIC prevalence. 
Bitcoin is by far the biggest and most stable coin, and altcoins have a history of falling apart. I would say LTC and DOGE are fine, but be careful and if you want safety stick to BTC. But the price still fluctuates.
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:57:23
Looks awesome. I will check it out.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:58:07
Is that the one Garza bought? (I don't actually know but he bought one of them...)
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:44:41
So can you use this anywhere a mastercard can be used? As in physical stores?
Also, any outside reviews on this? Should verify it is legitimate.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:39:55
Thank you to all of you. I lost money in this scam but I got out with at least some of my investment.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:58:02
Seems legit
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:19:41
Sadly yeah. It was great fun Scrypt mining last year on Multipool with a GPU but those days are no more.
If you want to mine for fun though you can pick up a cheap USB miner on Ebay. You will never pay it off but it is fun to set up and use (mining with one right now).
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:38:59
Everything is out of Paybase and converted to BTC into my secure Bitcoin wallet.
Sadly I can't get the rest (thankfully the minority) of my XPY out of the Cloud mining system for a few months. And I fear this will be collapsed by then.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:00:30
Just be careful. I should have seen through GAW's shabby economics and promises. Crap like this displays badly on Bitcoin which sucks. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:45:03
Shadowbanned comment. And yes they should but they won't. Too volatile/
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:18:15
Explain please?
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:24:10
Honestly I think he's dead. Otherwise he would have spent his coins or come out by now.
He is just too good at staying anonymous.
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:51:24
I know that, just wanted to see if Mods could confirm they were being messaged. Even though he is a scammer we still need to be honest and cite sources. Now that mods have replied I believe it.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:21:44
Most of the "features" yet to come that drew me in are already available elsewhere, so I now know (e.g. Purse.io). 
Sadly I still have some of their staking cloud miners locked up that I can't get out. Just hoping it still has a bit of value when I can finally dump those.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:29:31
I highly recommend Multibit. You are in control of your private keys because you aren't through an online service and the blockchain download is lightning fast. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:48:48
Don't sell them. I'll give you reasons to keep.
First off, they are ASICs, so no they can only mine SHA-256.
1) You can still mine. Think of it, you basically that have MONEY PRINTERS. Yeah they don't make much if anything, but still, that's pretty cool. Save 'em for when Bitcoin rises above your Electric costs.
2) Heat. They only use 2W each but I actually just finished building a stand that heats a little container of water with an Antminer U1 (same watts as Block Erupter). Useless? Yes. But still fun.
3) Introduce other people to bitcoin. You have here these little machines that make money just for sitting there. How cool is that?
All in all, don't sell.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:27:46
Oh no, this was less than a year ago. 
Last year you could mine LTC and DOGE on a GPU for a great profit, and the great thing is that GPUs are still useful once the mining became unprofitable.
Sadly scrypt ASICs hit the scene and it went the way of Bitcoin. Now, the best you can hope for on even expensive miners is return on investment after many months.
And DO NOT BUY INTO cloud mining. Trust me, I've been ripped off there. Almost all are scams.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:28:15
Yes it is that is how a ponzi works!
You know this. Someone gets money on someone elses back.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:34:27
Well considering they are $310, no, especially not mining. If you want tiny fractions you can visit faucets but these aren't really worth it. Best bet is buying or selling something for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:22:58
I know but that general naive optimism is bad. Without better adoption bitcoin could well go back to $50. 
I think a major issue is nobody has come up with a really easy way to explain it to the masses. BTC is really complicated, and while I am perfectly fine with that many aren't. Even the simplest explanations end up a few pages long.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:47:14
I'll go look there now, I think I have more time than you do so don't both posting links. I'll find it myself. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:28:38
No I'm not, the reason for my name is that Dogecoin reddit is kind of what got me back into cryptos (I was into bitcoin for awhile but kind of dropped out for a year when I got busy). I missed moolah. I hear people talk of him but would you mind explaining what happened? Thanks.
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:51:28
Merry Christmas. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:56:46
Let's make up for the high mining difficulty.

Who is downvoting this post... this is gold
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:07:39
0.9999 BTC at the very least.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:16:51
Somehow I doubt this is him.
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:55:43
It helped. It was really a culmination of multiple posts. Thank you for posting that.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:59:57
I'm out of a collapsing scam :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:49:04
The altcoin is a very big scam that is about to burst and is going to give BTC a bad name.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:41:54
Why even post this comment? Electron waste.
It could help someone else get out. It took a lot of posts to finally get me to realize.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:35:40
USB miners. 100% fun, 0% profit.
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:57:17
Not trying to defend anyone but is there any proof that this is legitimate?
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:53:45
Post of the day. Upvote to front page!
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:57:25
TOTALLY not a ponzi scheme. Yeah. Legit. Def. Must believe.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:02:01
I think you meant to post this on hashtalk.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:17:50
You know I've seen the same thing on Hashtalk. This is bad optimism because you have no idea where the crash will end. "Cheaper" is relative.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:39:47
Honestly, a bad idea... I get the sentiment, but could be seen as assault.
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:37:55
GAW is a huge presence right now and is going to blow up soon, taking tons of bitcoins from many people. They will also give bitcoin bad reputation.
What if we could stop it?
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:54:24
Wooo shapeshift! Excellent!
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:22:41
Coinfire is certainly not pumping it. I would support them if I were you.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:05:50
Then this post served its purpose. I'm glad you are out as well. I've sadly got some coins locked up in stakers but I can't get rid of those.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:14:38
This would be cool, but unfortunately we always hit the stumbling block that is the fact that the game company must make money. So there must be a fee, usually quite high.
Now we actually have this already through the Bitcoin Minecraft Server. But the amount of bitcoins gotten there cannot be used for a living, more like a fun bonus if you are already playing Minecraft. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:28:57
It will be deleted quickly, but I will go do that. I doubt it will help though.
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:19:36
Sorry, but this title is a joke. Every day we get a dozen people saying how they would donate but wikipedia doesn't accept bitcoin. And they do. Which is why I including it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:14:43
That looks... really cool.
Anyone have reviews on this? The site doesn't say much. I kind of want to make a RaspPi one.
