One of the dumbest comments I’ve ever come acrossed. Too much dumb money in this market. A correction is sooo imminient.

Don’t use tether. You’re going to lose all your money. Google Tether scam or tether bitfinex
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:50:14
Bitfinex Tether

This cannot be a coincidence. People this might be the last day. You need to do something.

You buy high and sell low?

Well you go see yourself. Look at the chart.

I'd say about $12,000 and back to $3,000.

Don't fall for this. Crpyto history isn't just a year. Check Nov 2013 - Dec 2014.

Well, obvously it IS something to fear. The market bubble getting bigger for the last few days. Major exchanges down.

Hello, I work for one of the big 4 accounting firms. If you're trying to file a tax return, try contacting the tax part of one of the 4. Me and my colleagues trade often and apparently a lot of us do it.

Bittrex charges 0.25%, and Bithumb charges 0.15% for transactions. Considering the premium is 15%, the fees are really nothing. Not many people can do it because only a small number of people hold foreign bank accounts.

Is this cherry-picking or real?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:35:38
true 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:22:26

Sale would be greater tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:23

I have other account but it got blocked by bitcoin reddit, because appearntly I spread FUD about the Bitfinex Tether issue.

Bithumb is a famous Korean crypto exchange. It's world's second largest exchange in terms of volume. You can look it up!
Yes you can have access to my Bithumb account then, because I think that's a logical thing to do. Once I provide the account info, I guess you can basically see I'm not lying about the profit percentage. Transactions would be within seconds once I receive bitcoin from you, because it has to be a speedy thing..
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:52:58
70% of profit + your original bitcoin price.. 
So for example, right now Korean exchanges have a premium of 15%. So if BTC in western is 1,000 USD, it's 1,150 in Korea. so the profit would be $150, and 70% of $150 would be yours to keep. Wanna chat using something else? like a messenger?
I'm being very serious.. not lying at all. Can swear to God I'm being honest.

You don't think they don't have enough cash to pay for it? Default.
