I wouldn’t consider Coinbase a middle man. Coinbase is an exchange. Now, whether you decide to leave your bitcoin on their exchange or keep them safely in your own private wallet is up to you.

Excuse me sir, but why would you sell bitcoin at 5k?
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:06:19
Litecoin for day to day payments, Bitcoin for larger payments such as a house or car.

Just give it two weeks bro

Yes, but BitPay is a solution to companies wanting to accept cryptocurrency without losing 70% of their revenue the next month. BitPay instantly converts the bitcoin sent to the address and gives the company their local currency. This is the best thing we have right now until the price isn’t so volatile.

Because it would be absolutely insane for an average person to store all of their money in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-14 01:27:04
@_date: 2018-11-14 01:23:01
It disappears into real money, bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 00:08:30
Yea I agree. We should be able to print trillions more so that the ones already existing lose the majority of their value. Great idea. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:07:40
Actually, you could do some of those things with bitcoin. Well, not directly through bitcoin. You could use a crypto card (such as the Coinbase Shift Card) at any store that accepts visa. There is also a service called Bitrefill where you can buy Steam vouchers with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:41:59
Yes, there is a potential etf in the works. Nobody knows if it will actually be approved though. I actually don’t think we really need an etf that bad. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:46:22
The verification on VirWox is optional. There are 4 different levels of your VirWox account, which dictate your daily limits on buying bitcoin. Once you reach Level 3, you have a daily limit of $480. The level up to Level 4 is optional, and requires a government issued id and proof of address. A level 4 account would raise your daily limits to $1,000. I am currently Level 3 with a daily limit of $480, and a monthly limit of $6,000. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:41:21
There is a chance that we bottom out to 4k. Nobody knows whether or not this will happen though. And yes, we will most definitely go up past 7k-8k eventually. That could be a while though. I’d say that maybe it wouldn’t hurt to buy a little right now and store it away safely. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 04:08:21
This is actually virtually impossible as there are an estimated 4 million bitcoins to be forever lost in existence. So, unless all 4 million bitcoins are found and sold, I don’t think the price will be hitting $0 anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:57:36
Hell yea
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:27:40
You can buy bitcoin instantly with paypal on VirWox with no Id, just an email. The fees are quite high though (13%) because of people using the chargeback feature in paypal. This is a method I use often.
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:17:26
I’m not saying that an upcoming bull run is impossible, but those who are expecting another December run like last year are going to be disappointed.
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:09:02
I don’t think there’s any rush to buy btc right now. We’re in a bear market and will most likely remain that way for another year or two. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 02:42:18
What do you mean there is no financial protection? Have you ever heard of someone hacking a users bitcoin wallet with just the knowledge of their public address? It’s impossible! If that were to be possible, I’m quite sure that Satoshi’s wallet would be hacked a very long time ago. The only way that someone has access to your funds is if they have access to your private key. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:03:23
I definitely agree with your argument. Although there are plenty of innovative coins evolving, I don’t see bitcoin dying off anytime soon. I don’t see a reason why they can not coexist with bitcoin. Ever since ethereum was released, people have been arguing over the “flippening.” That is yet to happen; instead, ethereum has existed in the space along with bitcoin. Whether we like it or not, bitcoin is here to stay (and I don’t see that as a problem). 
@_date: 2018-11-13 03:54:43
Maybe because you don’t need to bank crypto?
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:17:15
When you own bitcoin you are given the power and responsibility to be your own bank. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:15:54
Well because accepting bitcoin at your store attracts more people who want to spend their bitcoin, but they also want to take away the risk of losing that money. I totally agree with you in the matter of how this kind of defeats the purpose of bitcoin, but it’s going to be a long time until it’s used as a true global currency. I love bitcoin and hope to see it grow to this point one day. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:20:11
Actually that would be 0.00056 btc
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:23:56
I was definitely not preaching for BitPay and agree with you that BTCPay is the better option. I was just explaining how realistically most businesses aren’t sure about the whole bitcoin thing, as of now, and would prefer to convert it into their currency. If I was the owner of a business that accepted bitcoin I would keep it and use it. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:22:16
It doesn’t happen overnight. It took almost 50 years for credit cards to be accepted at most stores. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:08:46
Yea that’s why I don’t really own much nano. It’s a great coin but adoption is what really drives long term success. If it were all about the fees and transaction times, then bitcoin would have been gone a long time ago. I am also very surprised that verge is accepted and nano isn’t. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:25:23
I have used one and it was very fast, except it charged 30% fees. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:29:24
Edit: VirWox charges around 8% but PayPal takes a large cut. This estimates to around 13% in the end.
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:22:48
Newegg accepts bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:38:33
Exactly. But it would be nice to become rich from magic internet money. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 02:39:35
Wait so people don’t buy drugs with usd? 
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:19:52
@_date: 2018-11-11 12:02:47
I am sure that bitcoin will be much higher than 30k by the time 2030
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:01:16
This is totally awesome but the fees on the bitcoin network will be quite high and confirmation times will take a while. For a cheap and quick payment like coffee they should also use something like litecoin or nano. Don’t get me wrong though I’m all for adopting bitcoin, I just see it being used nowadays for larger payments (ex. Car or House). But then again I guess this is where LN comes in. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:13:08
Never try to time the market. Dollar Cost Average is your best friend. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:59:37
Yea I think that the Level 1 limit is $90. You have to first buy SLL and then you can buy bitcoin with those SLL. It’s an exchange that was made for the video game Second Life, but is really just used as a bitcoin exchange now. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 03:45:36
@_date: 2018-11-11 05:45:08
Well I could argue that if I take my printer and print my own dollar that it is better than the current one that we use today. It is simply due to the fact that bitcoin is the founding father of all cryptocurrencies and will most likely always be the most valuable. Sure, there are many coins faster and cheaper to use than bitcoin. But bitcoin has already made a name for itself over the years and has the strongest network of all coins. Throughout the development of new coins, bitcoin will still remain king.
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:42:25
Bitcoin. Just look how far we’ve come in the last 10 years, why not go even further?
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:31:21
It’s nice to see someone using bitcoin for what it was actually intended for. Good job :)
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:56:03
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:17:16
How so?
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:35:43
Yes. Your 12 word key is also known as a BIP-39 seed phrase. You can find a BIP-39 seed phrase converter to convert your 12 words into the private key string, and then import it into another wallet. Do this quick, as your funds may be in danger. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:47:34
Lol ok. So basically, a bitcoin wallet has 2 different keys: a private key and a public key. I’m sure you know this already. The private key grants the user access to the wallet, whereas the public key can only be used to send funds to the wallet. Those 12 words that you wrote down were the private key, but not the long string of characters. Nobody wants to write down a long string of characters to remember so that they can access their wallet. People found a way to convert these strings into words, and this is known as BIP-39. So, in order for you to recover your private key you would need to use a BIP-39 seed converter to convert your 12 word phrase into the private key string. You can then import your private key into a bitcoin wallet such as Electrum. I hope this helped you. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:59:15
I would recommend that you download the Electrum wallet on a desktop. It is one of the oldest and most known bitcoin wallets. But make sure that you are downloading it from electrum.org and not a malware site. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:31:30
But the reason for the fees in bitcoin is to pay the miners. What would be the incentive for me to run a Nano node?
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:07:21
Glad I could help man :)
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:01:15
Actually, I forgot that you can directly enter your 12 word phrase into Electrum to back it up. I would recommend downloading Electrum and doing this. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:37:01
What was your Bitcoin public key address? We can check it’s balance and transaction history on the blockchain.

Thank you sir

I am by no means a supporter of bcash, but they kind of had to list it for legal reasons. Users that store their funds on the exchange do not have access to their private keys, therefore it is up to Gemini to retrieve the forked coins with their private keys. It was easier for them to just add BCH, rather than hearing people complain about where their forked coins are. Also, many people have filed lawsuits on exchanges just for them not receiving coins after a fork. Not your keys, not your bitcoin.
