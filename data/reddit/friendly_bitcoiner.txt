I'm not super familiar with this industry but don't news sites also depend on advertising? 
I wonder what the trade off is between delivering an ad free experience with paid articles compared to generating ad revenue and having free articles.

You guys should hook up with [Famos Amos AKA Mr. iPad Chain]( He's pretty Bitcoin friendly and keeps it real :)

Does this implementation allow for recurring subscriptions?
I was always under the impression that magazines like Time made their money from people signing up and being auto-renewed.
Bitcoin naturally prevents this but I can't imagine Time would be eager to kill off this "bad" revenue stream.

One challenge is that a lot of Bitcoin owners/buyers are who are looking to make money. Even this is community, a lot of people are more excited about going to the Moon and HODLing  than using/spending Bitcoin.

You're essentially asking Wikipedia to promote Bitcoin and withholding a donation until they do. I'm all for mainstream adoption but this is not the right way to get it. 
Just donating via Bitcoin will speak for itself. If Wikipedia saw large donations from Bitcoin organically, they would likely want to feature it as a payment method. If they have a few guys say, "Yeah, we're not donating until you add a Bitcoin button", they'll probably just write it off.

It is kind of shameful. (See my response to your other comment and to the OP.) 
There's a big difference between giving to cause you believe in or an organization you appreciate and trying to turn the transaction into a "you do this for me and then I'll give you money." If you don't understand that, I'm not sure we can continue this conversation.

I'm sure some people subscribe to magazines on their iPads/tablets.

What advantages would a hardware wallet hold over a well designed app? Wouldn't it make sense to push for getting something like Mycelium as pre-installed app?

I hate to say it but this seem a little misguided. It's very unlikely the the PR person/agency managing the account will collect the tip. 
Even if they do, what kind of reaction are you hoping for? They may say thanks or something but this doesn't really give them a reason to accept Bitcoin...

What do credit card fees normally sit at? I thought they were something like 1% - 3% in the US!

Ha- I should hope not! We can follow [Ryan's comments]( and his thoughts on the Bitcoin connection of this project though.

Merry X-mas to all :)

Are you planning on keeping the Bitcoin you get from the sale or will you be selling them?
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:55:36
I think I saw this same thing posted on another Bitcoin subreddit. Make sure to report it as spam!
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:42:12
You'd think they'd fill the "Your company here!" images with some sort of affiliate banners at least. It just looks so amateurish!
@_date: 2014-12-17 00:01:58
This is a neat concept. I wonder how would Time go about pricing each article? Would it be a flat price regardless of article length/content/author? 
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:00:59
I don't really follow this logic. When you're donating, it shouldn't be because you get anything it return.
I think you end up looking like a jerk if you withhold donations from organizations if they don't do what you're asking.
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:17:37
In what context? The issue is trying to extort a nonprofit organization into doing something by promising money.
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:40:16
Unfortunately, I think this something of a standard. Amazon Marketplace charges sellers roughly 15% for sales in most categories.
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:27:01
This isn't a sale/barter situation. It's a donation drive for a nonprofit. It's like going up to an orphanage and telling them "Hey, I have these great toys I can donate but I'll only give them to you if you have the kids wear these shirts that promote something I'm invested in."
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:53:44
I wonder how this will actually play out. 
I don't see how this supports or furthers Bitcoin like Reddit's cryptocurrency guy said it would.
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:31:05
Ryan- is there a good reason for the lack of transparency? What's the benefit of dumbing things down or hiding the Bitcoin association?
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:56:54
Does Changetip come with a guide upon delivering a tip?
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:36:38
This is really interesting! It's awesome when companies go above and beyond to help the bitcoin economy :)

I'm not sure. The idea is interesting and I hope to learn more about it working with the Jet team. The article makes it sound as if sellers will have the options of discounting if certain conditions are met. I think this could be an awesome place to show something like: "5% off when you pay with Bitcoin!"

I already won a lifetime membership to the site. I don't really care about the stock options. Even if they do end up being worth something, I don't think I'd have the money to exercise them. I'm all in on Bitcoin ;)
