The limitation is in place as a safety measure. Further development of the arbitration system is required. Manfred wisely limited the volume at this early stage. Feel free to chip in the forum, voice your concerns and/or get more information.

SegWit = 1.8 meg block size, at best. See thread with deep details and tests around here somewhere.

Occurs to me that if it is a really large amount you might need to go through additional KYC or have it cleared 'manually'  by their staff. Also some issues with deposits coming from accounts not in your name or not registered with kraken are known, this has to be dealt with manually too before it shows on your balance. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:32:30
Don't panic, try all the already suggested channels and also their twitter. They'll get back to you.

Thus, Kraken's servers are located in Ecuador.

Read this: 
It's the best recount of the whole CSW shenanigans, the writer spent several months very close to CSW just prior to the climax. Superbly written. Although long, it's worth a complete relaxed read. Will satisfy your thirst ;) 
After reading this my opinion is that he his half Satoshi. And I didn't think he was more than a conman. Hope that the writer turns his material into a book!

Or: if a minority in bad faith funds and shapes developer base purposefully, distorting developer distribution such that &gt;95% support core and push their for-profit agenda...

Yeah right. Just look at the traded volumes trend vs. ETH for the last 24h. BTC is in a good position (market cap) but the outlook is clearly negative while this black cloud of uncertainty (TX fees, unpredictable confirmation delay) hangs over it. An urgent quick fix is needed, 2MB blocks NOW to mitigate risk.

Had same issue in Spain, ING branch claimed they wouldn't process SEPA transfer for my own security. Next day I moved all my money to another bank.
It's your money and it's a legit transfer, if they block just because they can then they don't deserve to be holding your fiat.
Edit: they wouldn't do it even after I insisted it's my money AND risk too.

PSA: Kraken cannot be used for trading, the trading engine is broken and Kraken support acknowledges this.
Market orders are accepted and not executed/filled. Sometimes they fill after 5/10 minutes.
Limit orders BELOW the market are accepted and not executed/filled.
Open leveraged position cannot be closed because of the above.
Stop loss/take profit orders are not triggered.
These are not one-offs, it is systematically like this whenever there is some market action.
I have lost a few thousand euros in the last week due to not being able to close positions.
Kraken support admits the fault and as a kind of compensation gave me fee credit... doesn't cover even 10% of losses incurred though.
I'll go back whenthey annouce a revamped trading engine but for now recommend you stay well away if you are a trader.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:58:25
Interesting. Using the API I have the same issues, mega lag and/or can't get orders to execute, wonder what's causing the different response in your case - perhaps physical location?
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:29:58
ETH DAO heist is likely script material. BTC is not as cool,  is it? Craig Wright, block size debate, everything seems stale and definitely not exciting. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:54:06
Update 31/Jul:
Logged in to Kraken and tried a couple of trades to see if issues still there.
Issues remain unsolved, market orders are accepted and not executed/filled (waited a few minutes...).
Also contacted Kraken support asking for status update.
Will be posting link in @_date: 2017-07-31 13:24:21
Kraken support reply regarding status update:

MtGox Support Chat... one screenshot says it all:
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:57:09
I really don't care WHY they don't process the withdrawals. It could be due to limitations imposed by the banks, it ould be that they are taking advantage of the BTC differential vs. other exchanges or some other reason (bankrupcy looms...).
If you are OK with it because it is the kind of thing you should cope with when "riding the BTC rollercoaster", then fine... don't complain.
I am not ok with this and believe no one should be because they are a for-profit organization and we are customers.
@_date: 2013-07-12 10:29:14
No reply to my second message. Don't expect much... eventually the funds will arrive (fingers crossed) and I'll never ever ever use Gox again.
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:21:58
Last update, I'm over and out: BFL support responded to my cry for help on the forum shoutbox, they acknowledge the payment and will address my account status shortly.
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:55:49
Well, i'm back here to say it didn't quite work out the way I expected: BFL actually refunded my payment, but that's not what I asked for... just wanted them to acknowledge having received it (which they did) and correct my order status accordingly while keeping my original place in the queue (didn't happen).
So now I can reorder and go to the back of the queue... or just be thankful I have my money back and avoid risking it again. I guess I'll go with the second and invest in a somewhat more stable / less risky endeavor - some other possibilities here: 
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:14:07
OP here, thanks for all the links and info. I'll give it a shot, let you know if I get something out of it!
@_date: 2013-07-17 13:21:55
You have the nerve to come here and tell lies?
There have been zero wire or SEPA withdrawals in the last 2 weeks and there's a bounty on bitcointalk that proves it.
Gentlemen, move your money out while you can. I did and took a loss but MtGox simply can't be trusted, period.
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:48:18
Exactly my point... I asked them why I'm not free to do what I want with my money... and got the same kind of empty content, unilateral, robot-tape recorder reply. They didn't even blink when I told them I'd close the account if they didn't explain why.
@_date: 2013-07-11 10:46:06
Update 2 - I ask MtGox for replies to my specific queries:
"You are providing the same generic information that is already public.
I demand a reply to my specific queries:
None of my transfers are above 10000USD or equivalent.
The 3 weeks for my SEPA tranfers expire next week - does that mean you guarantee I'll have the money in my accounts by then?
Note that I have wire transfers pending too - what about these? How long for a wire transfer to get to my account?"
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:15:27
...have tried the forum and its shoutbox... advice from there is to have patience and contact office On twitter there are several users complaining about the same Paypal payment issues: 
@_date: 2013-07-11 09:18:41
more precisely, over 54%.
@_date: 2013-05-21 14:09:50
I understand the pre-order terms of sale (and so should everyone else, it's a blank check my friends) but that doesn't explain why they are not acknowledging my payment.
@_date: 2013-05-17 10:09:05
I've tried all of them except freenode, which I'll give a shot when I'm not behind a corporate firewall - thanks in any case!
@_date: 2013-07-18 11:23:12
If MtGox's FB page becomes a wall of shame (it is already on the righteous path) then the market share will drop even more. If they have any hopes of staying in business then this pressure will hopefully force them to service their customers at at the most basic level: letting them regain control of their funds after they've repeatedly failed to deliver (withdrawals not executed).

I was a client of ING in Spain... they blocked SEPA transfers to even recognized and authorized bitcoin exchanges like Bitcoin Central for "security reasons"... I just moved all my money out.
Strange is that ING Netherlands doesn't care at all. Must be some Spanish smartass manager's idea.
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:46:09
I don't have problems with ING Netherlands, where I also have an account... on top of probably being illegal, they disguise it in kind of fake paternalism which makes it even more pathetic.
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:34:52
Hummm any thoughts on how to cancel fiat transfers at MtGox? I think it has to be done manually through support, right? And support just ignores you... so... 
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:47:03
Should I even try to file a complaint with a consumer protection agency? Or will that be a waste of time?
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:18:18
Their statement is pure bull. They offered me today 16th July to cancel the 4 transfers I have in "confirmed status" and return the fiat to my account without any expenses. That means as of today 16th July they/their associated financial institution haven't processed any of these transfers yet (and these transfers were confirmed on June 24th, 30th and July 2nd).
I'm now considering (a) taking a loss of about 700USD by cancelling withdrawals, buying BTC and tranfering to another exchange to cash out... or (b) waiting...
@_date: 2013-07-12 10:28:13
Thanks for the advice. I guess my message reflects the feeling of helplessness and despair that being a MtGox client creates, sooner or later, "being Goxed" . Deep down I know I won't get any meaningful reply or interesting information. Never did in any of my MtGox support interactions: it's like talking to a character with limited lines in a point'n'click adventure game, perhaps worse because those characters are at least somewhat useful before they start repeating the same line over and over...
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:46:25
I have it so I can use the damned website when it suits me but do not post any personal content nor provide them with my details.

Update - Reply from MtGox with generic and widely known information:
We sincerely regret for the inconvenience caused to you at this point of time.
Please note that SEPA withdrawal are currently taking up to 3 weeks to process due to the sheer volume of withdrawal requests in queue.
If your withdrawal is larger than 10,000 USD or equivalent then it will take at least 1 month to process.
Once the funds processed from our end, we will update you on it.
Best regards,
Mt.Gox Team"

one thing is what they can and can't do... but they are keeping customers in the dark without any reason, you don't even know what they can and can't do...
@_date: 2013-05-21 14:11:51
Update 21/may: still no news from BFL; sent claim through paypal, patiently waiting to avoid having to escalate it to a dispute; didn't try freenode yet.
