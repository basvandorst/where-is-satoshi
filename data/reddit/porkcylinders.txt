I'd love for LN to be the solution to all of Bitcoin's problems, but the experience on mainnet is going to be significantly different when opening those three channels requires one on-chain transaction per channel, with the associated fees and waiting time. I don't think it's helpful to present the testnet experience as being directly comparable to that.

At least it took until the third sentence to reveal that they have no idea what they're talking about.

They're correct that it's open source and can be forked of course. But they're implying that a hundred people can create a hundred forks and that would cause BTC will become worthless overnight. If that was going to happen it would have happened long before now.

The Ledger Chrome app is a bit of a buggy mess at the moment unfortunately.  
If you reset the Chrome app (Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Reset application data) it should start showing your transaction history again, although switching chains in the app will break it again.  
If you're getting the "Unable to validate transaction" error then you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the Chrome app and Nano S apps, I was getting the same error and that fixed it for me.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:00:51
To balance it out, they did briefly release a version of their Chrome app that displayed everyone's Litecoin balance as zero:

Mining BTC will be 2.4 times more profitable than BCH after the difficulty adjustment in a few hours.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:08:49
The BCH difficulty is still the same (860221984436) as of the last block as it was at the time of the fork, despite only 5 blocks having been mined in the last 17 hours:   
Presumably the rule that's supposed to reduce difficulty if fewer than 6 blocks are mined in 12 hours isn't taking effect?

Beware that Ledger consider their Chrome app "[non-critical]( which means that no testing is done on it prior to release.  For example, version 1.9.1 made everyone's balance "disappear" (until it was patched) because it was hardcoded to use testnet instead of mainnet. I'd advise against using the new Segwit functionality.

With the current hashrate, the BCH difficulty is going to quadruple in less than 24 hours from now, at which point it will be about 2.5 times more profitable to mine BTC than BCH. Expect the BTC hashrate to go back above 90% at that point.

Please don't buy a Ledger, over the last month they've repeatedly released versions of their Chrome app with major bugs due to their lack of testing. It's only a matter of time before a version is released that causes people to lose funds.

bitcoind doesn't hold the UTXO in memory, it's in the chainstate database on disk. The main use of memory is the mempool which was only about 300MB at nearly 200k transactions during the weekend.

You might want to consider the number of times Ledger have released versions of their software that are completely broken because they haven't undergone the most basic of testing.  
v1.8.1 of their Chrome extension [caused all LTC balances to disappear]( because a typo in the codebase broke the derivation path.  
v1.9.1 was [released hard-coded to testnet]( which made it appear as if all BTC balances had disappeared.  
Either of those issues would have been caught by doing any testing whatsoever before release. After the second one I was sufficiently terrified that I gave up and got a Trezor instead.

You should have your seed backed up which can be used in most other wallets/services. Even if you didn't, you could still access your Trezor by other means such as the Python client:

There seems to be some disagreement about what a bit actually is - the Bitcoin Wiki says 1 bit = 100 satoshis but  says 1 bit = 1 satoshi as does [this article]( on The Merkle. Either way, given that the point of the video was to illustrate the divisibility of Bitcoin it would have made more sense to mention 10^8 Satoshis instead of 10^6 bits.

This doesn't require a firmware update (as long as you already have 1.3.1), just updates to the Chrome app and BTC/BCH apps on the device.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:11:40
Disclaimer: I haven't done this myself yet (it's not possible until after the fork), but in theory:  
1. Start the Bitcoin Cash app on the Nano S  
2. Start the Ledger Bitcoin Chrome app, choose Bitcoin Cash-&gt;Split  
3. Click Receive, copy the receive address somewhere  
4. Restart the Chrome app (or go to Settings-&gt;Blockchain), this time choose Bitcoin Cash-&gt;Main  
5. Send your BCH from here to the address you got in Step 3  
6. From now on, always use Bitcoin Cash-&gt;Split option when sending/receiving BCH

Ledger's blog post about the update: 
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:53:31
There's no new firmware at the moment. There are new versions of the Chrome app (1.8.1) and the Nano S Bitcoin app (1.1.8), plus a new Nano S Bitcoin Cash app (1.1.8). It's a little unfortunate that it requires a separate Nano S app for BCH as it takes up even more of the limited space on the device.
