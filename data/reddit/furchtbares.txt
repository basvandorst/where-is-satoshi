If you understand the risks, fine. But many newcomers don't know about btc-e and their past dealings. It is a risk to them.

What does that have to with their customers? Ask those of Liberty Reserve. They all lost their money, no matter where they got it from. You're talking close to a hundred million dollars there.
It is the user's responsibility yes. But it doesn't hurt giving them all the information to make a good decision.
If you want Bitcoin to be successful, you do not want BTC-e as the top exchange.

Arthur Budovsky from Liberty Reserve is Costa Rican and was arrested in Spain.

I agree it is a great trading site. And I value privacy too, but I value my money more. 
Nobody disputes that they have broken every law on AML, so arrests can happen anytime. Why take that risk?

The problem wouldn't be limited to BTC-e, there would be a big fall-out for Bitcoin as a whole. Especially after Gox.

Agree when talking the protocol. But you know what I mean.

The lack of identity requirements is what creates the risk.

With BTC-e becoming the biggest exchange, there is plenty reason to worry.

No audit can wipe out their past dealings.

The drug trade uses PerfectMoney (and Liberty Reserve before they got shut down). From there you can channel it straight to anonymous credit cards or other investments.

There was never a problem getting money in and out of Liberty Reserve. Until it became impossible.

So if you were btc-e ceo, you would use airports like normal. I am pretty sure you wouldn't.

Exactly. But newbees don't know about the BTC-e history. They should.
