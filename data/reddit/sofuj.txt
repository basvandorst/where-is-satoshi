Used kraken before. No problems with it. Got the money in my account in 1 or 2 days after putting a withdraw order.

..seriously?.. I mean.. seriously? 
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:22:40
I believe this could be done in a private blockchain (eg. similar to testnet) as to avoid having to generate\buy btc and control miner fees.
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:37:10
Exactly. This sort of stuff is what makes bitcoin lose credibility. Just because something is regulated / controlled by governments does not mean it's inherently bad.
Seriously, sometimes it looks most of the people here are 14yo anarchists.

Thank you!

Hello, thanks for your suggestion. The donation plugin was discussed and I'm seriously considering doing it, as for the first part of your comment, if I understood correctly (somehow convert paypal to btc?) it is not possible...
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:21:36
If they don't have a a bitcoin client installed and click it, it will probably confuse many users.
Since most bitcoin users have online wallets I don't think it will be very helpful.
You could try something like [this]( (shameless plug). it's a donation widget with goal that I am developing. Hover the progress bar for details, click on the button, then on the address and you will see, what I think, is a better approach to this problem.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:13:44
Can you, or do you know anyone who could design a nice Donate bitcoin button and meter? Maybe literally a thermometer.
Right now I have this very basic version: 
Hover the mouse pointer on the progress bar to get a tooltip with progress\goal
Click on the image to get btc funding options.
I am aware that UI needs to be changed a bit, suggestions?

wow! I'm completely astonished by all the great feedback, never expected this thread to get this popular! Just came back home and I have 60+ notifications.
I will try to answer all of you by tomorrow (since it's a bit late over here now).
Many good ideas here, can't wait to get started :)
Thank you ! 
PS: Keep the Pm's coming, maybe I'll feel extra generous and do this more than once ;)
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:45:11
For now I would use sometihing like  bitcoinmonitor.net since many stores do not have the proper server requirements to install the  btc client
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:46:35
Everything online. I seriously doubt any business owner around here knows about btc...
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:06:11
Will look into the bitcoin part of the plugin, as the plugin itselfm i'm not very familiar with wp plugins so if someone is willing to help on that part this can be done
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:59:18
Will the meeting be held in English or Slovene?
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:15:31
Thank you, saved your message for future reference
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:13:27
Ok, will do
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:13:00
It didn't work, but thanks anyway!
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:17:44
Thanks for the interest, will reply to your PM soon
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:27:38
Something like that already exists. Will PM you later with info. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:10:35
By "server requirements" I meant it couldn't be shared hosting
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:51:47
Good idea, will fork it
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:20:35
Would love to help you, but my ASP skills are too low to make a plugin for that shopping cart...
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:22:57
haha glad you mentioned you weren't serious. Had a client once that came up with a similar ida.... he wasn't joking..
I was thinking of using bitcoinmonitor.net. i like the concept and security of it... 
EDIT: which seems to be very similar to blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:29:00
Planning on using bitcoinmonitor.net or similar services. offline wallet+no fees
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:17:06
I'm sorry, I'm not that familiar with widgets... Try posting this question on a @_date: 2013-04-11 17:26:49
I actually bought yesterday just hours before the cra.... ermm decline.
So yeah... I won't sell for sure
@_date: 2013-05-29 09:36:38
How much did you have in your pp account?
What is the link to your website btw
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:12:00
Thanks. I will make it open source. So anyone can get it for free and modify it as they see fit.
I still want to make some changes before releasing it though. Mainly cosmetic stuff.
@_date: 2013-05-08 09:28:10
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:28:28
Exactly! The success of bitcoin should not be built upon destruction of economies. We all want btc to succeed, but we shouldn't wish this sort of stuff to anyone. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:02:05
I agree with you. That's why I will use bitcoinmonitor.net or some similar service. Maybe in the future my own btc client on the shop server that would confirm and report via rpc or something.
But i will always try to work with a solution involving offline wallets.

Thank you. Hopefully there will be some news soon
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:04:44
I agree, never did btc integration before so...
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:48:32
Thank you.

What do you mean? ftp password?
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:53:47
I agree with you, not a fan of online wallets either. But having a copy and paste solution would work for both cases. 
Maybe the online wallets could a create a simple program that when downloaded would hook into the bitcoin:xxxxxxx URI and launch the browser into the online wallet send page. It would be something easy to make. I could actually do such app if there was interest by the online wallet users.
