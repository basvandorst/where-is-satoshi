Wow. So what does that say? Women aren't interested in computer science? Women aren't interested in finance? Men are? Theres got to be some conclusion to be drawn as to why women don't.. partake

Well you're wrong. Huobi and BTCC have 0% trading fees. ALL the trading bots are there lol.

Mt. Gox, a large bitcoin exchange is having extreme difficulties at the moment. They were originally Magic the Gathering Online Exchange.
@_date: 2014-06-11 02:16:32
To an extent, but some transactions have negligible fees. Furthermore, the average total fee reward per block is around 0.05 to 0.1 btc which again, negligible compared to the current 25 btc reward. 
In fact, they may be subtly manipulating the bitcoin community to provide higher bitcoin fees in an effort to gain access to their coveted blocks.

I found the lube, everything went smoooooothly.

Its a sensationalist title that you're getting sucked in by. Its just a measure to protect the peoples money from years of bank fees. Any of them can easily send in a form to the government and get their money back. Stop spreading FUD

Plot twist. Ghash is petamine.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:18:27
Some people naively believe that the recent downtrend in price from about 660 to 560 in the last few days can be attributed somehow to the Ghash mining pool. In reality the price is sinking in anticipation of the FBI's sale of 30,000 bitcoins. The market is simply reacting to new information and settling at the expected value based on that information. More than that, I bet the majority of these sellers are divesting into cash or alt coins on the chance that the FBI's sale drives the price even lower so that they can make a lot of money. What do you think?

Weeeeeeee 1000 bits

Did this work for you? my tip isnt going through =(
@_date: 2014-06-11 02:43:14
You can look through the blockchain and find thousands of addresses from 2009/2010 with 25/50 btc sitting in them from enthusiasts who mined 1 or 2 blocks on their own, with the price where it is today I am confident that many of those coins are LONG gone, they would have been transfered to a more secure wallet or spent/sold at some point in time along the way to today. Mt Gox has likely lost 650,000 Bitcoins on their own singlehandedly. 
There are people who send random amounts of bitcoin to addresses like 1BitcoinEater to destroy them forever, and other people who send money to addresses mistakenly, forever lost.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:13:58
This is the only obvious reason of the price dip. People are just cashing out to alt coins while they wait for the FBI to tank the price themselves and gonna crash those alt coins for bitcoins in a few weeks
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:35:07
Yeah.. I believe it'd be pretty bad.. World markets lose 30% in a day, etc.. lol
@_date: 2014-06-11 02:19:20
They were at 48% earlier in the day so.. Good?
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:20:19
In an open market like this, with a bunch of computer scientists, what would go wrong
@_date: 2014-06-11 02:11:42
Of the current 12 million mined, like 4-5 million are confirmed to be lost and gone for ever and a further couple of million havent moved in years... I imagine the trend of losing bitcoins to old addresses will continue in the future and only a handful of the original 21 million will be in circulation.

Yeah lol, that website was so credible. /s

That's cool, i'm a physics undergrad. So you're doing numerical simulations with clustered parallel computing, is that what you mean by large scale?

FOR NOW!!!!!
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:30:16
I don't really know enough about wallet technology I guess to comment but if there isn't a real reason and if I had my coins since 2009, I promise they would have moved dozens of times if not hundreds by now, assuming I hadn't sold them for some bizarre reason
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:55:34
That's pretty cool. Any specific portions of the hospital? Heating, design, elevators?

Every 10 minutes on average a block is mined. The difficulty is adjusted every 2 weeks to ensure that only 1 block is mined per average of 10 minutes. Current hash rate is like 50 ph/s and difficulty is 6,119,726,089
If many miners stop mining and hash rate goes to 1 ph/s, the difficulty will drastically readjust in the next adjustment.

Sounds educated. He probably had an ulterior motive. Or was coked out or something.

In physics, jounce or snap is the fourth derivative of the position vector with respect to time, with the first, second, and third derivatives being velocity, acceleration, and jerk, respectively; hence, the jounce is the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time.
The fourth, fifth and sixth derivatives of position as a function of time are "sometimes somewhat facetiously"[1][2] referred to as Snap, Crackle and Pop respectively. Because higher-order derivatives are not commonly useful, there has been no consensus among physicists on the proper names for derivatives above jounce.[2] Despite this, physicists[who?] have proposed other names such as "Lock", "Drop", "Shot" and "Put" for higher-ordered derivatives.

No, that would be more alarming. It was just a dummy account I made a while ago :)

There wouldn't be nearly as much volatility if bitcoin was the global currency. It would behave exactly as the dollar does today with prices changing slowly in time on the order of months or years.
