You can continue to try and make endless posts about the dao, eth being a "premine", (satoshi owns 1m coins btw, waaaay more than the foundation, I hope you pray every night that whoever owns those
 private keys doesn´t wake up and have a bad day one morning), why do you care if it is an unregistered security? you "Hate the government"  so why does it even matter if it doesn´t pass "the Howey test", ETH won´t ever pass 110m coins in your lifetime or your grandsons so stop spreading FUD, and the DAO was a decision by the miners. software was deployed, miners ran it. HASHPOWER is law, just like UASF is the most retarded idea that ever existed because not a single miner was going to point their hashpower to that trash.
So if you want to continue to live in the narrative that eth is pointless, go ahead, just know that criminals are already figuring out that Bitcoin isn´t private, and unlike ETH that actually has a ton of use cases, once criminals drop bitcoin and start using Monero I will love to see how many tx/day the bitcoin network does. Good luck
Monero is the actual coin that does everything BTC does, and better. ETH is a whole different beast. Keep living in your fairy tale if you think bitcoin is the best and only crypto. and, so much for being the most "decentralized" cryptocurrency when: 
Bitcoin IS CENTRALIZED. But you already know that. You are just waay too emotionally attached to your investment and to  this idea of the government dissapearing and since bitcoin is ran by a handful of cypherpunks that lack social skills, you just can´t say no to this utopic fairytale that is bitcoin.  Good luck

did you even read the article? no charges for anyone, they aren´t prosecuting shit. This is basically just a warning of what we already knew, and future ICOS better not sell to US residents now. (which they were supposedly not doing anyway. so, yeah, nothing changed)

I hope you guys stop posting Tuur Demester posts here then. His opinion is worthless because he isn´t a dev, right?

Aren´t you bitcoiners supposed to be anarchists? when are you going to stop spreading FUD about icos? stop begging the SEC to come rescue you. You´ve been posting the same shit about paycoin all day long. ETH and ICOs will be fine.
