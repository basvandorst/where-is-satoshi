What possible incentive would their be to develop bitcoin specific wallets when they could literally just create and develop their own cryptocurrency
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:17:48
Until the government bans merchants from accepting btc for a crypto currency developed by them or one they have a future partnership with

China? What other countries have done this? That doesn't have anything to do with "advanced society" lmao you fucking retard
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:58:44
How the fuck does that even make any sense?
@_date: 2019-08-31 05:30:38
Where's your proof
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:04:44
It won't matter once we are in a complete totalitarian surveillance state

It's a million times easier just to say that you are betting on the price going down
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:32:16
Lmao I think OP was just joking you wiseguy
@_date: 2019-08-26 04:18:28
You mad
@_date: 2019-08-15 09:10:28
That still doesn't answer the question, you retard. And I'm not saying it doesn't exist, and never said that either, you retard, but yes, the restrictions as to what people can and will be able to do will be far elevated in the future compared to what they are today regardless of how far the technology is.

You're weird bruh
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:42:40
That ain’t even proper math but ok
