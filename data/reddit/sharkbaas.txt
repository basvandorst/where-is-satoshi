I would like to join the discussion: 
What about Alexander Vinnik? 
MtGox announced in February 2014 that they got hacked and one month later, March 2014 the 111,114 BTC were sent to [ 
According to multiple reports, there were 850,000 BTC stolen from MtGox and 200,000 were eventually recovered, which leaves us with 650,000 BTC's still unrecovered. 
Alexander Vinnik was one of the suspects regarding the MtGox hack.  He was accused of the MtGox hack and got arrested in Greece in July 2017. Now a year later he is extradited to Russia on 4 September 2018, one day later 5 September 2018 we see the $1B movement. Could it be that Alexander did really hack the MtGox exchange and is now trying to sell all his Bitcoins in Russia?
