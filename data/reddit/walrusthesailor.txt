No, that's not what I mean. The total mining energy consumption will just decrease, as it will be less profitable to mine.
It's about profitability. When the block is worth $200k, then a certain amount of energy is spent per block that makes it profitable. So let's say $50k worth of energy is spent to mine every $200k block. When the Bitcoin price drops, or the block rewards decrease, or the energy price increases, less energy is going to be spent mining them.

Fake news.
I just sold one Bitcoin to my little brother for $10. So the exchange rate is 1 BTC = 10 USD.

The fees are sustainable because people keep paying them, like you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:45:58
Possibly has something to do with this status update from yesterday?






edit: Or were you possibly selling below trade prices?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:11:05
An exchange is for exchanging, simple as that!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:27:36
If you paid $13.24, you've probably paid 350 satoshi per byte, which is the highest fee currently estimated to confirm a transaction within the next few blocks. Days like today are going to be more prevalent, but it's not necessary to pay such fees when you don't need the transaction to be confirmed so quickly.
You can pay a lot less, with SegWit and by paying attention to setting the fee.
At the moment the network is at peak congestion, be aware of that.

@_date: 2017-12-08 15:33:02
Very interesting. The transaction is 1670 bytes, which is huge.
According to  it is estimated to take 1500 minutes at most (from now), which is 25 hours.
Edit: Ah, it's from a hot wallet of BitMex... That explains the reason it's such a large transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:02:57
Yes, you can spend them 'twice'. One branch does not care about the other. They only have a mutual history. If you spend them on one, the other branch does not contain that transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:12:27
Mining is now worth spending a lot of energy on because of the block reward and it's value in USD. That Bitcoin reward will halve about every 4 years. Every block is now worth nearly $200k (12.5 * 15000 = 187500). When prices are rising faster than the block rewards will halve, the miners will probably keep increasing the energy consumption. But, eventually, I think the Bitcoin price will stabilize, and the block rewards to be of less and less incentive to mine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:03:41
I'm fairly sure!

GDAX has been leading the USD price mostly, but the EUR exchange seems out of control. It's weird to see this. I'm looking for explanations.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:51
It's the amount of BTC that people are willing to sell for that specific amount. Once enough people match their order, the sell 'wall' will break down. That's when the next 'cheapest' BTC will be bought.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:25:52
What transaction, can you show it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:09:25
In EUR. EUR is going to pass USD in this pace on GDAX.

It's important to understand that nothing is 'given', in a sense. Forking will cause two branches to exist that have the same history. Any transactions (history) before the fork are known by both chains. This causes you to be able to spend coins, from the same history, on both chains. So, how you can spend those 'given' coins is by having wallet software that allows you to make a new transaction on a certain chain.
A fork does not change history, it's just a diverging branch that will never merge again.

Exchanges usually set fixed fees. I would guess that at the moment those fees are a little lower than average, even though exchanges put high fees on the transactions. I'd estimate it would take at least an hour to get in the first block, but it might be much longer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:23:04
The interface of the Ledger Nano S application is very clear. It even shows you fiat fee estimates.

My guess is that people will find out where to put nodes to make profit. So if there are huge amounts of traffic between two nodes that require multiple hops to reach each other, someone will notice that and put a node between them to make the route cheaper and shorter.
This seems a natural way such a network will emerge. It's about finding the cheapest path.

If BitFinex was leading this rally, I would be more worried. With GDAX leading, I'm more at ease.

Well, as evident, there has not been a chain split, and so the earliest of the two would be the date mentioned.

So I assume there is some kind of meaningful word seed in there.
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:58:13
What is the reason you think it must be a 14 word seed?
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:41:31
No, below there.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:18:19
The risk is in keeping the seed. So you can make it as safe as you need by thinking about how to make sure your seed will stay accessible to you. (Or the ones you trust when you pass away or become incapable of doing it.)
Risk for the hot wallet is a totally different kind of risk. You'll probably not lose access to an exchange, but you don't own the funds, they do. They can block access to you or their company might fail; or they might be hacked. In the case of Coinbase I deem those risks low, but you don't own your funds!
Also, I wouldn't generate the address on Electrum. There are easier tools to generate paper wallets. ( etc.) Or throw some dice and generate your address from that. (

Might be a bad explanation, but: Assume I give you a key to unlock a door. Now I copy the door. You can now unlock both doors. The key I gave you is still the same. Both chains (doors) will have the same history -- accepting the same keys, allowing you to participate in both forks.
So, after the fork you'll 'have both coins'.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:06:52
If you think Bitcoin has a positive future ahead, then I'd recommend stop thinking about trading and buying a hardware wallet. Just buy Bitcoins on any exchange you want and transfer them to your wallet.
I hear people saying good things about LocalBitcoins.com, that might be worth looking into.
Otherwise I'd say just stuck with Coinbase/GDAX. Not sure about the amount you're about to invest, but $5000 seems like a fine limit to prevent yourself from making rushed decisions in this euphoric week.
If you're buying on Coinbase, the forks and all technological underlying concepts do not really matter. Coinbase is like a bank, you don't own your Bitcoins in the same sense you would with a hardware or paper wallet. The balance you will have on the exchange will be virtual. Of course you have the control over when to withdraw and deposit, but in reality you're tied to the legal terms that Coinbase set when you registered with them, just like traditional banks hold money for you, essentially lending them to them under legal terms that might be bad for you when things go awry.
Keep reading on investing into Bitcoin, make up your own decision. Don't rush it, keep asking questions. PM me if you need any help. Good luck!

@_date: 2017-11-02 11:56:31
Sorry for not really answering your question.
It's just that no one should tell you what to do. Warnings are everywhere, it's volatile, it has potential, it's technological. Just ask yourself if you could handle losing a large amount of your investment. If you can, then what is there to lose? This might be the value store of the future, or not, who knows? No one knows, we can just guess and time will tell.

An exchange will be safe enough for most people. Especially a regulated one like Coinbase's. However, the idea of Bitcoin is that people do not have to rely on institutes and centralised party to handle their currency, so naturally it's recommended to keep your Bitcoin where it belongs: in a wallet. Having the wallet is the only to fully ensure it stays there.
Exchanges have the risk of stopping, technological failures, limits enforced by them, and changes of rules that make it harder for you to access your funds. Just like keeping your money at a bank, it's not your money anymore, it's the bank's.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:59:08
Coinbase offers GDAX, which is an exchange. It might look and feel advanced, but it's cheaper to use it. Via that you can buy and sell anytime you like.

You're never too late. If you believe Bitcoin is here to stick around for the next couple of years, just invest what you can miss. Don't rush yourself if you don't want to. Just make your own decision.
Actually, the current price might be a good time to step in.
