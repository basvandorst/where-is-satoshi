I've been wondering about this, as I just ordered a new phone. Couldn't you just cancel your 2FA for each site and then sign up again, this time backing up the QR code required to activate 2FA?

And this is why you need international socialism!  So the beneficiaries of said drugs also have to pay the social costs associated with them. Just how it works is exploitation.

Why is Peter still listed as the chairman on the website?

"There are currently 11.9 billion bitcoins in circulation." - I think they're off by a few satoshis...

Of course I believe in the importance of anonymity online, but an "identity ecosystem" does not necessitate top down control of everything you do online. Couldn't similar technologies allow for more direct democracy and accountability? Politicians won't listen to anonymous posters online, but what about verified constituents? And what how about spawning a blockchain-like voting technology? I know there is much room for abuse, and I don't really fully understand what this article is proposing but I do not think that anonymity is ALWAYS the more empowering option.

I don't know of one, and it does sound like a great idea. I would stick with established causes and organizations first, and have a sidebar with relevant information for organizations and causes wanting to accept bitcoin. Also ways to petition organizations that we want to support, but don't yet take our coins. I would not include for-profit and not-for-profit entities in the same subreddit, and figure out some way of establishing trust as to prevent the inevitable scammers from taking advantage of those of us with less greedy intentions.

Recurring coinbase purchases are great for these. For a while I was doing 0.1 BTC a week, but that's starting to become a bit pricey for my budget...

Donations to organizations and people who support the open and private internet, donations to pirates, buying overseas prescriptions, paying back friends and family (printed a few paper wallets to entice those I know to get into bitcoin), other cryptocurrencies, and a nifty plastic deposit card with "Bank of [my name]" written on it.
