Schwab is great.  Superb customer service, unlimited options, and no fees on your debit card no matter what ATM/place you use it.  I also think they're probably going to be one of the first banks that does something with BTC.

Really great article--Bernanke's comments pushed me to finally get into BTC.  I bet this article (WSJ the only paper nowadays with readership and subscribers increasing) will push a lot of new BTC users.  However, many of these users may be intimidated by the technicalities of using BTC, but hopefully they're able to make it past the first few confusing hours and stick with the currency.
Now, wouldn't it be cool if WSJ would allow subscribers to pay with BTC?  If so, I would be down.

For those like me that need someone else to substitute it:
""A short quiz: If you plan to use Bitcoin throughout your life and are not a Bitcoin producer, should you wish for higher or lower prices for Bitcoin? Likewise, if you are going to buy a car from time to time but are not an auto manufacturer, should you prefer higher or lower car prices? These questions, of course, answer themselves.
But now for the final exam: If you expect to be a net saver during the next five years, should you hope for a higher or lower Bitcoin returns during that period? Many investors get this one wrong. Even though they are going to be net buyers of Bitcoin for many years to come, they are elated when Bitcoin prices rise and depressed when they fall. In effect, they rejoice because prices have risen for the "Bitcoins" they will soon be buying. This reaction makes no sense. Only those who will be sellers of equities in the near future should be happy at seeing Bitcoins rise. Prospective purchasers should much prefer sinking prices."
But actually, here is a [link]( to what the Oracle of Omaha said about BTC when with pals Bill Gates and Charlie Munger:
Bill Gates: "[Bitcoin] is a techno tour de force." 
Charlie Munger: "I think it's rat poison." 
Warren Buffett: "I think either Charlie or Bill is right."

Was frustrated last weekend as I couldn't find a store carrying tactical gear and apparel that accepted BTC (was looking for Crye products but would've supported any venue that had this type of gear and apparel).  Hint--this is a way to differentiate yourself from your competition...

I'm older (in college) and my father was not happy when he heard that I put $160 of my own into BTC (he knows what it is, but isn't crazy about it).  However, I explained to him that I'm not day trading it,  and that it'll teach me one of two lessons:  1) hopping on an emerging technology/trend and benefiting from it or 2) experiencing the hardships of speculation personally.  He accepted this and doesn't give me a hard time about it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:33:38
I agree.  I'm a Bitcoin newbie half in it for the educational experience and half in it for the actual investment.  Whenever I interact on people on here, everyone seems to be crazy.  This is cool because my questions are usually answered, but whenever I try to point something out or bring up a defect about Bitcoin, I'm hounded on.  It's a bummer because it really takes the educational aspect out of it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:00:51
Agreed.  CampBX really prides itself on its security (and it isn't fake stuff either).  Only wish I could deposit with a bank account as then I would actually use them.

What was wrong with localbitcoins?  Pay someone cash in your city to give you BTC, and then transfer them to your computer's wallet.  It's pretty simple.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:37:36
Not true--otherwise you would not have read about BTC and be here on Reddit.  BTC is just a little challenging to understand because it's unprecedented.
Yet, if you really are confused about BTC, do two things (1) keep browsing here as you'll pick up on the trends and (2) look at that Bereneberg paper.  That is written in simple terms and a quick read.  After you read that, come back here.

Interesting, so like Charles Schwab?
If so, it saves us (American taxpayers) a big hassle (as opposed to buying directly from Bitstamp).  
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:37:47
It's interesting because I think the conditions in the Levant and North Africa favor BTC moreso than the ones in the Gulf, but the Gulf has the infrastructure to support an exchange.
On your sheesha comment, it's funny because that'll probably happen before I am able to ever pay in bills greater than 10 dinars.  
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:22:01
No problem with venting your frustrations on the international financial system, but Bernanke is the most innovative chairman the Fed has had.  To see a smart (here come the downvotes) person like him positively comment on BTC is a good sign.  
Think about it--the head of one of the largest Central Banks in the world is applauding a virtual, decentralized currency lacking a central bank.  That's kind of a big deal.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:26:39
If BTC are used to purchase goods or services, then normal sales tax should be applied IMO.
However, if a person like you or me sells BTC for US Dollars, I don't think that exchange should be taxed (haven't we already learned that capital gains-types of taxes do more harm than good)?  Instead, the firm conducting the exchange (bank or brokerage) should be taxed.  As a result, you'll see some fees applied.
Not a tax expert, but that's my two cents.

I enjoy white papers like these on BTC.  I wish they would be circulated more on Reddit as they seem hard to find.  I find them more valuable than random blog posts.
I'm also trying to do a paper analyzing how dark networks (yep, I'm a conflict studies type of person) can specifically use BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:44:03
So what if they criticize Bitcoin?  I would rather be able to access a forum where I am likely to get fairly honest criticism about where I am putting my money than to just hang out in a forum where everyone is drinking the same Kool-Aid.  For innovative, potentially revolutionary ideas like BTC, it's important for us to always be questioning our assumptions as we try to figure out its future.  A great way to do that is to hear what other smart people in arguably one of the most important academic fields have to say.  Sure, it's one thing to say "BTC is a ponzi-scheme--look at these idiots", but it's another thing for someone to say "BTC has a ton of arbitrage not being solved by connectivity--how will this affect users."  
If you want to read just positive articles about BTC, then read Bitcoinmagazine.  But if you want to try to fully understand BTC, then prepare yourself to hear from both sides of the aisle.
Disclosure:  I am an owner (and user) of BTC.  I don't necessarily believe BTC is the future, but think that it will bear a strong resemblance.

They're also more likely to roll it out online first, before in stores.  Major retailers like Best Buy have a custom designed POS--configuring and re installing it to accept a new currency is pricey.
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:17:48
Do you think this is attributed to the fact that Coinbase says that they conduct background checks of employees to protect consumer information?

I don't know if you have seen this piece specifically on BTC and taxes [linky]( but it may be of interest.  It would also be interesting to see if you disagreed with the author on anything.
Anyways, I have yet to ask my accountant about Bitcoin--but am hesitant to as I am not 100% if he'll even know what I'm talking about.  Do you think that I am wrong in this area and that most accountants today can look at Bitcoin and figure out how to properly help their clients report it to the IRS? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:06:46
Thanks--this makes it sound really simple and I a now know what to expect.  
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:15:19
I prefer Coinbase because of three reasons:  1) it seems secure (enough), 2) allows me to transfer my coins to my offline wallet (a requirement--storage in these virtual wallets should be temporary), and 3) they are a US broker which means that I don't have to worry about any of the foreign account tax laws with opening an account with Mt. Gox or some of these other services (this is probably one reason why it's more expensive).  I'm sure there are other ways to get a better rate, but I think Coinbase is ultimately the best for the customer--the customer in BTC for the long run.

My bet--as a WF user who has had absolutely no issues with Coinbase, they've probably seen a surge of withdrawals to Coinbase and are trying to figure out 1) is this some kind of fraud or error with our security, 2) why is ____ percent of our money being transferred here, 3) what type of customers are using this coinbase (if they decided to stop working with coinbase, how would they be impacted).  
OR, since WF is IMO the only big bank that has a sense of strategy, they are trying to figure out more about Coinbase and BTC in general.  
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:56:29

As a Bitcoin newbie (as of yesterday), I went with MultiBit instead of Bitcoin-QT.  Although I did a little research (I checked in on this subbreddit occasionally as I prefer the Reddit format over an actual forum), I ultimately chose MultiBit because of how it is advertised as simple and easy for newbies.  It's also not resource intensive (I'm running this on a laptop in a country with hardly any internet infrastructure).  I veered away from an online wallet because of the security issues.
I think the greater challenge for newbies like myself is A) securing our wallets (trying to figure out Armory) and B) getting our first few Bitcoins in the account.  Especially for people not super tech saavy.  For BTC's userbase to surge, it's necessary for this set-up process to become easier (WSJ's essential endorsement in last weekend's paper will push more not-super-tech savvy people to invest).
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:22:56
Hopefully this 15% growth is matched by a similar increase in customer service and operations--it's important that Coinbase continues to provide the same, great experience to all of these new users.

From an American who is studying economics in Jordan:  First, I applaud your decision and think it'll be a great experience.  However, these thoughts come to mind.  Please don't interpret these comments as attempts to dissuade you from your pursuit, but rather things to think about.
I think you'll have a couple key challenges to think about.
First, why do you think people will be inclined to use instead of the various Islamic financial institutions available?  Unlike other global financial institutions, Islamic banks have been extremely successful the past decade and did a fairly good job at withstanding the global financial crisis.  They aren't perfect, but will present some tough competition.
Second, I think you're going to have some issues with some of the technological infrastructure in the region.  Although some places like the UAE are more than developed in this area, places like Jordan, Yemen, and many parts of Saudi lack the technological infrastructure to really support BTC (example:  in Jordan, few people consume 5GB a month per bandwidth--many ISPs provide 2.5G or 3G equivalent speed; mining is not an option).  Does this mean that wallets hosted online are the solution?
Third, I think the learning curve point you mention is going to be very difficult; if educated Americans who read a newspaper every week can barely figure it out, then how do you expected a population with a majority lacking a serious technical education to?  On the plus side, almost half of this region's population is under the age of 21 (younger people will better grasp it), but on the negative side, the current education and development strategy is flawed.  
Lastly, I think you should focus on the mobile aspect of BTC.  Everyone in MENA has at least one cell phone, and probably two.  About half of these are smart phones.  I think this is the infrastructure you'll have to work off of for now.
Again, I do not mean to dissuade you--these are just my thoughts after living in the Levant this semester.  You sound like a smart guy, and I'm sure the more you travel the region, the more you'll take in.  Please keep us posted and reach out if you have any questions.

Thank you for linking this.  I did read it (this, the two recent WIRED articles, and the WSJ article are the best I've read on BTC so far).  Although I'm somewhat techie by mainstream standards, I am by no means as skilled as the rest of the people in this subreddit.  Thus, much of this paper was still difficult to understand (I wasn't able to takeaway more than the main idea).
My question for you OP (and anybody else reading this):  What are the best resources on BTC that I can read?  They can encompass any part of BTC (criminal uses, the economics, trading, mining, encryption, etc).  However, there is one caveat:  it must be an essay (like this), e-book, or hard book.  The reason for this caveat is that when I discover a phenomena like BTC, in order to process it, I need to get away from the Internet, load up my Kindle, and read.  
With that, any suggestions?  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:21:04
You are very right--I also think that BTC's anonymity is overrated.  It's certainly more anonymous than many forms of payment, but to call it anonymous--or even pseudo anonymous--is overrated IMO.
Some researchers out at the University of California have done research on this and are getting better at tracking and determining who is behind various BTC purchases.  Their methodology and arguments are in an essay called "A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among
Men with No Names" and can be Googled.  
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:21:58
Hey bud,
You don't have to be super tech saavy to figure out BTC.  You sound like a smart guy (we both read WSJ), so I'm going to post three links for you (the first one I think will really help you out).
First, this recent [ from Berenberg Bank linkies: This is one of the best things that I have read on BTC. It is split into two parts: a current analysis of the BTC and arguing whether it's speculation, or normal. The second part is BTC 101 and does a great job of explaining how BTC works economically, not technically, with nice graphs. Not perfect (the counterarguments weren't organized very well), but well done.
Second, this [video]( (with the dialogue copied into writing in this post) is the best thing IMO that has explained the technicalities behind BTC. It's 22 minutes, but really touches on everything and the plain language combined with the simple drawings make it understandable for a wide audience.
Third, Satoshi's [paper]( Why not let readers hear from the man/men that created BTC themselves? It's not easy reading for everyone, but IMO deserves a spot in the side bar.
Lastly, I'm going to provide you the same advice that I did to my father (he was in the same boat--read about BTC in WSJ and wanted to start trading).  Since I'm assuming you're in the US, register an account with either Coinbase or CoinMKT (Coinbase allows you to deposit money from you bank while while CoinMKT only accepts mailed in money orders).  Verify an account with them (this may take a couple days), and then buy your BTC (this may take a few days as well).  Once your order is complete, you can withdraw them to your local wallet.
Good luck and have fun trading!

Sorry for coming back to this a little late, but I have a question:  what do you think are the best online introductory resources on Bitcoin في اللغة العربية?  I was trying to explain it into Arabic today to some Jordanian friends and had a few issues as they don't know English.  We went over it on the Bitcoin Wikipedia Arabic page, but it was pretty short.  Know of any resources?
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:51:25
This is really cool.  
Your audience consists of CEO's--this is good because these guys are strategists and think big picture stuff in 15 years.
Questions for them to ponder:
How drastically have payments changed within the past 10 years?  How about within the past 5 years?  How about within the past year?  With technology driving change, what do you think payments will look like in 5 years?  Will Bitcoin be part of this?
"Pyramid products" are transforming/being overtaken by network products (centralized web servers --&gt; cloud, encyclopedia brittanica--&gt;wikipedia, itunes/napster--&gt;bittorent, centralized manufacturing--&gt;3D printing, vc funding--&gt;crowdsourced funding, etc).  Bitcoin is part of the decentralization of currency in the future.  Stronger currency networks (like USD for example) will be more resilient, but what about smaller, weaker currencies?
Online payments currently are a hassle--you have to add a items to your cart, and then pull out your wallet and enter a handful of random numbers.  This needs to become more convenient, like Amazon's Oneclick.  Explain how BTC's current structure offers convenience.  
Any chance that you can post results/your slides/how it goes?
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:58:24
Bernanke's comments (in addition to Richard Branson's recent remarks) have propelled me to jump into Bitcoin.  However, I am afraid that the first few complex hours of figuring out how to mine, how to use the client, how to trade coins, etc will deter many investors.  Payments in the future need to be convenient (look at Square or MasterCard's new OneCard).  IMHO, Bitcoin needs to become more convenient for it to endure.

Hi, I knew that statement was a little confusing.
Here's what I mean by variety of ways:  With Bitcoin, you can purchase with Litecoins, other alt-currencies, cash of almost any currency in a face-to-face transaction, PayPal-to-Linden Dollars, direct deposit, etc.  These different methods illustrate why the amount of time that it may take Bitcoin to adjust its price is so great; it has to adjust on multiple markets.

@_date: 2013-11-26 17:30:10
Good article--wasn't perfect because as u/pardax points out, it makes some errors and at times the tone comes across as almost too energetic (not ideal for a banking publication).  
Nevertheless, it's probably the most comprehensive and simplest piece that I've read on BTC.  The 101 section is the best 101 section that I've seen (they cite Satoshi's paper, which is a little too complicated for some people).  Additionally, their arguments on why BTC will grow are good.  Their counterargument is evident, but I wish they would have devoted a special section to this.
However, thank you for the read OP--I wish I could come across good white papers like this on BTC as I am trying to find researched pieces instead of speculative blog posts.
The moderators should consider adding this to the sidebar IMO.
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:07:50
The author makes good points--BTC isn't perfect (note:  I am a BTC user as of one week ago--still learning/trying to figure out this currency).
Surprisingly, the one point that the author doesn't point out is convenience.  The future of payments need to be convenient--that is the trend.  Whether it's Square, MasterCard's cool new DisplayCard, or Amazon OneClick, the current transaction system is too complex for people, and will move towards simplicity because of consumer demand.  I think BTC has the potential to be more convenient and simpler in the future, but as of right now, nobody has figured out how to do it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:13:55
Bitcoin is not like other commodities like cars or bread because it is a currency; it replaces money.  But unlike traditional currency, it is not tangible in the sense that you can't hold it (well technically you can get a physical BTC, but you know what I mean).  Since they can't stash all of their BTC's away under their mattress like cash, they're going to need to understand it more so that they trust it, and fully use it.  
I like you're example on cash--not a lot of people understand where our dollars come from and how currency circulates.  But with credit cards and debit cards though, people understand that actually better than they do cash.  They understand the concept of credit and interest.  This understanding arguably partially drives the embrace of these forms of payment IMO.
Maybe you are right in the sense that not everyone needs to understand the cryptology behind BTC (besides the fact that it's securely encrypted without any major issues thus far).  
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:17:49
Yeah.  As a WF user, in EVERY interaction they ask if it's alright for them to mention any products/services that they notice.
