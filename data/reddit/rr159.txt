Voting is one of the main (if not *the* main) uses of distributed cryptographic technology in the future. But just using the bitcoin blockchain... I don't think it's that simple.
Other uses: money (obviously), anti-spam (hashcash failed, but some other system can succeed), lots of sophisticated financial products (imagine using a network, and having your money automatically distributed among the systems that carry your data from end to end according to how much data each carries).

I think we should start a separate currency. Call it "lolcatcoin" or "monkeycoin" or whatever. What would make monkeycoins special is that they would be magically convertible to bitcoins at a fixed rate (i.e. 1 btc = 5,000 monkeycoins): just send them to a bitcoin address and voilà. Plus, their official client would not need to download a blockchain, it would be instantaneous. The only problem is transaction fees would be higher than dogecoin.
And how would we create that magical coin? Take Electrum or Multibit and change the names ;-).

I've been thinking, when the blockchain grows enough, people will start sending copies of it through snail mail.

Given that you necessarily need a trusted institution to hand out one private key per person (unless you want to assign voting power based on hashing power or IP addresses) you could give a smart card to each person containing the private key. Smart cards do all cryptographic operations "inside" the chip and getting a copy of the key out is pretty difficult, so I think it could work in practice.

Maybe a future version could have a smart micro NFC device that switches between different stored (modifiable) addresses?

While I agree with you, the libertarian argument is that in the longer term it would result in a solid economy (eliminating companies like mtgox).

It's for buyer protection, and it's not strictly a bad thing: if you buy something and the seller sends you a broken product or doesn't deliver at all, you can file a claim with PayPal and get your money back.
The problem is PayPal sides with the buyer 90% of the time, creating the reverse problem: buyers who charge back and get their things for free. With no real way for them to know if you really sent something, it's often your word against theirs. And there's no way to "disable" it. So it's not a reliable method for transferring money at all, because you're at the mercy of someone sitting in an office who can arbitrarily decide if you deserve your payment or not.
With bitcoin, this could be implemented by a third party holding the coins in escrow until you receive your item. By decoupling the payment method from the "protection provider" we can have some actual competition in that field. 
Now if only eBay didn't force you to use PayPal... where are the competition laws when you need them?

To be fair, the concept of checks is not bad. It's kinda like a writing a bitcoin transaction in a piece of paper, except the blockchain is the bank and the private key is your signature. Of course that doesn't mean they shouldn't have been replaced by electronic transfers...
But meh, I've said it many times before: if banks had created a good, practical and free (or virtually free) way to transfer money from person to person online 10 years ago (it's not like it's THEIR FUCKING JOB or anything), nobody would have paid any attention to bitcoin.

While developing distributed software (like bitcoin or bittorrent) might be hard, once that's done you don't need millions of dollars to distribute it to people, since it can be copied across the internet for (almost) free.

Indeed, it's still a bug that should be fixed no matter what some people say.
It's like the people who say "but a good programmer can make good code even in PHP!". Yes, ultimately a good programmer should be able to work with any tool, but the tools should also be designed to be easy to use. It's been known for decades that removing complexity and hidden details like that makes it much less likely for security problems to appear.
Having said that, if you're making a bitcoin exchange you should verify ALL the mathematical assumptions yourself. That's more important than anything else. So it's clearly their fault too.

I remember asking to change "PPCoin" to something that sounded better. For a long time all the responses were "if the coin is good, the name won't really matter!" and variations. It seems they at least changed it to "Peercoin" now, which is better (but still not catchy enough IMO).

Exactly, that's the core of the whole mess that is online security. 
The mathematical problem of point-to-point security was solved decades ago: I give you my public key, you give me yours, voilà, 100% secure communication. The *real* problem is now finding a way to let *every user on the internet* to talk with *every server* in a way that prevents scams in practice. How can you do that if your computer has no idea what's out there? This isn't a technical or cryptographic problem, it's a practical problem, and it has to rely on external entities to do so.
It's the problem of trust. You can have just one big single trusted entity (which we will have when the NWO is instituted, WAKE UP SHEEPLE!), several trusted entities (CAs), or you could have a distributed-trust model where you ask other clients if their information agrees with yours. This has been tried but never succeeded in practice (yet), for example

I'd personally love to have a checkbox on PayPal that said "lose consumer protection, get 2% discount". For highly reputable companies like Amazon you could save a bit of money.
The problem is, you have to be very rational to really profit from this. Meaning: know your probabilities, do the math, do not give in to optimism bias and loss aversion (aka "it's gonna be fine, I don't need protection"), which is hard. Most people would end up checking it every time to save $2.25 and then complain when they lose $200. Which is why PayPal does *not* offer this option.
Anarcho-capitalists would be happy because they could blame the problem on "the stupid people". Problem is nobody has any easy way to turn the stupid people into smart people. So overall fraud would skyrocket, but hey, it's not my problem.

Question: if I understand this correctly, their objective is to learn what IP addresses the transactions come from, right? Since the transactions themselves are already public.
Since bitcoin works by flooding, couldn't someone set up a simple and cheap "transaction proxy" service that receives signed transactions and broadcasts them on the net, thus hiding the original IP? You would have to trust them not to keep logs, but I think that's not much of a problem in practice.

As explained on the other comments, it does not provide authentication of any kind. Anybody can create PGP keys the same way anybody can create SSL certificates. If you want your PGP key to have any real value you have to ask someone trusted to verify your identity and sign it... hey, does that remind me of anything?
SSL has problems, and I agree it's too centralized, but PGP does not have any advantage over it.
And besides, as also pointed in the comments, any online shop NEEDS an SSL certificate already, because that's the only usable way to encrypt your traffic.

Buy 1TB external drive (&lt;$100), run Windows 7's built in backup tool, wait a few hours, repeat weekly (or at least monthly).

Personally, for Windows 7 and up I'd recommend just trying the built-in backup tool. You connect a hard disk, select which files you want to copy and off you go. It can even make a system image. The first backup takes many hours but after that it's faster.
In fact, I recommend backing *everything* up, even if it's unnecessary. Because the cost is practically zero, just leave it running while you use the computer for a few hours every week or so and you're good.
In Windows 8 it's hidden under "Windows 7 file recovery". For other OSs, I don't know.

Hah. Apple will block your app if it has a link to a website they don't like, or if it lets you buy anything that doesn't go their payments system, or if they just fucking feel like it. Their App store is tighter than a... well, than something very tight. Just [Google]( [a]( [bit](

This, I see the appeal of using gold as a currency but it just doesn't work like that. The only way I can imagine something like this being practical is embedding small pieces of gold into standard bills (did someone say... gold standard?). And in the end you're still relying into your trust of the other person, since it's just not practical to verify the authenticity of every single piece of gold you receive.

Google is one of the biggest pushers of HTML5, and yet they're also by far the company that does more user-agent sniffing on the internet, often restricting access to their sites to a small white list of browsers. I wish they'd stop doing crap like that.

I just meant the "3 backups, 2 different backup media, 1 of these backups offsite" rule but with starting with 10 buckups :P.
Backups are almost free: you have thousands of online services that let you upload small files for free, you can buy USB sticks for like $3 (if you buy in bulk) or recordable CD-R for pennies, and you probably already have at least 5 devices capable of storing information so there's no reason to limit yourself to 3 if it's something important.

[Only sensible answer](
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:28:11
Let me try to explain a part:
Imagine a huge public file that is kept in sync by thousands of computers around the world, in a way similar to sharing a file through Bittorrent, only the download never ends since the file is always slowly growing. This file stores a very long list of transactions, of the form "user XXX sends 0.25 to YYY". This way, by adding the total received and sent amounts, you can calculate the final balance of any user. The computers have agreed to not accept any transaction that does not have enough funds or is otherwise invalid.
That is, in essence, how bitcoin works. The end result is that you can make an "account" on the network (that is identified by a public address, like 1Hvv8Wy3YNVnTbt9HEGgUkoLVWAix84Wtp) and that account will have a balance (a number decided by the network) and can "receive from" or "send to" other accounts, by broadcasting that order to the network. So it works like money.
(PS: use Electrum as the client. Don't use the official one unless you feel like downloading 14GB of data)

I think realistically you'd need at least a simple computer to do the basic parts. It probably requires thousands of iterations, and the probability of you making a mistake somewhere and ruining the whole thing is really high. Even designing and building a simple but full processor is not that hard if you have some formal education on that (a big organization like PayPal or a government would definitely be able to do it).
However if all you need is a secure way to create keys, I suggest just grabbing a computer with no internet connection, reading the specifications and reimplementing all the algorithms in Python. There's no way to backdoor that.
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:03:41
I think it's more like virus encrypts files with random key, sends key to virus-owner, deletes key and original files. When you pay, the owner sends (some way) the key to the program.
The only way to get your files back would be if the police found the culprit and unlocked all files from the master computer. But I doubt they have a procedure for undoing malware so you'd be out of luck anyway.

This. Sometimes I think bitcoin is kind of a work around for a system that refuses to step into the modern age. It's 2013, we have high-speed wireless internet connections on (almost) every city, we carry pocket computers everywhere, and yet we can't send money to other people without paying absurdly inflated fees to corporations that are already rich enough. And since there was no way for anyone to disrupt that market, "we" had to create an entire new digital currency.
I wonder how a government-backed digital currency would have looked. Maybe we'll actually get to see it some day?

They used to have paypal/credit card icons in their site for no reason. Half their site is untranslated from russian. They have no clear AML/KYC policy.

And if you've ever tried to use their API, most of it is undocumented and you have to figure it out yourself.
And yet they continue to be one of the most popular exchanges. Don't ask me why.

There should be no way a link could directly steal money from there. The worst thing it could do is phishing, but you just have to remember to check that the domain is correct and the connection is secure (on MtGox you should see "Mt Gox Co LTD" in green on the address bar).
You shouldn't keep much money on online wallets anyway. Use electrum instead (and make backups or write down your seed).
