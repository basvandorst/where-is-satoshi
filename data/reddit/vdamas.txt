My laptop says that based on the time it took with one cpu to hash the word aaaaaa 9\^9 or 387420489 times it would require 3077530 days, 12 hours, 18 minutes, 51 seconds  (+-9637,85 years) just to do 9\^9 to all words (still would have to do 1\^1 till 9\^8). 
Nice protection added to the password, that only requires memorization of additional 2 numbers.

Does password has repeated letters ?
If yes: 26\^6 = 26 \* 26 \* 26 \* 26 \* 26 \* 26 = 308,915,776 words
If no: 26 \* 25 \* 24 \* 23 \* 22 \* 21 = 26!/20! = 165,765,600 words
Pow: start 1\^1 end 9\^9 the possible hashing values are:
Hash each word using every possible hashing values and check if pkey matches address given.
Well better start hashing, its going to take a long time  :D

Keep one unconfigured in case you loose/damage one of the other two.
Configure each one of the other two and split your crypto bags between them.
About the emergency in case lost backup keys, move funds asap to other addresses that you fully  control and that are not compromised.
If others have your keys they can move funds and there's nothing you can do about it.

I mean those are the possible hashing rounds possible per word.
For example 10 till 15 rounds are not possible since base is limited to digit 9.
