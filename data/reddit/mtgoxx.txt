Happy Christmas, I'm back

It's new year in China. Banks will be closed until February 5th.

Thank you for sharing this here, happily downvoted.

Why do this when Chinese banks are closing ? Is this kind of dirty game to keep stable price for couple next days?
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:06:21
Maybe this is fake news?
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:58:18
People will feel so stupid for selling that low when price will go back and withdraws open. This is why I always prefer keeping BTC rather cash. It's huge difference if you own bitcoins worth of $2000 rather than be stuck with $450 in dollars. Good luck catching the train.

Why do you think that Gox has been fucked. They're getting large fee from all trades. While volume is up there, they're in the business.
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:28:15
I see how this is effecting Chinese people and BTC China exchange volume. And how the price is raising there.  Huge news !
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:25:02
But the price at houbi is not dropping. If they're not panicking why should we ?

It's 31 in China already

Bitcoin should get away from Gox. Gox  right now is that alcoholic friend, which you've lend your money and he will come up with all kind of different excuses why he can't give it back now. I hate to see bitcoin getting hurt by this so much. Gox is like cancer. You can't live with it. You need to destroy it or it eventually will kill all your body. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 08:46:53
Or maybe they are breaking the law and want to keep it quite?
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:14:38
Roll out the system which people won't be able to test because banks are closed. Or maybe someone has more information, what does this mean of "closed banks" in China until February 5 ?

I used custom built NN with Tensorflow / Keras. It uses Conv1D mixed with Bidirectional LSTMs. I am using a custom dataset  I have been collecting for two years. I also generate some synthetic training data to expand my training examples. I've collected and finalized my network with 35 different features snapshotted every 5 minutes. It uses an average of 18 differently trained agents. 12 agents try to predict a shorter time period with the input of (144, 35), and the rest of the 6 try to predict a longer time period and larger moves with the input of (288, 35).  I have re-train mechanisms that remove old agents and replace them with new agents every day. With my server, I am able to retrain 7 agents a day.

I chose conv1d to transform my 5min window to 30 minute packed features. I visually made a decision in order to make assumptions of what is happening in the market I need to compress information I have into visible patterns. Run those patterns both directions and run one more time that output through simple LSTM and in the end I use quite large dense layers. Activations are standard ones, relu for conv1 / dense and tanh for LSTMs.. Optimizer is popular one as well, adam. I ended up with lots of params and not that large of dataset at the end so I use lots of regulerizations L1, L2 and dropout. Also all my features are zero centered. 
Talking about features I'm using all kinds of different ones, from price to volume, to blockchain activity, exchange activities, couple lagging indicators to give my models the sense where they are in time, since basically what model receives is a snapshot of one day action.
Sorry, this is the most what I can give you, I've worked 2 years on this, day and night. Basically what I'm trying to achieve from sharing max 2 of 288 signals publically a day to get attention from serious capital and sell my technology and move to other things in life.

Hi guys. I was working a long time on this Machine Learning project of mine. I'm happy I can finally share some of that work publicly and it seems to give some results. So here it goes - [ 
Anyone interested in pure statistical analysis you can always follow my tool live. Thank you. 
Achieved is when it hits &gt;3% into the predicted direction, failed when it hits the opposite direction &gt;3%.

I have been fetching this data from [blockchain.info]( API
[24hrbtcsent]( \- Number of btc sent in the last 24 hours (in satoshi)
It is not working for two days now. Anyone knows alternative endpoint for this?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:35:15
But won't it mean that bitcoin will be worthless inside the country?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:19:56
You people just like nice numbers, look at 2877. If this holds it holds if not, it will go to 1k.

Nice man, I love your site !
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:51:17
I really don't know what is the original source. It could be. Shame to dailyfinance.com then.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:51:57
Very funny...
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:56:36
But the question stays: "Who's buying there? Why?"
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:01:49
Not correct. 1,356 who owns value of bitcoins more than 1 million dollars, own another 25%.  So 1452 people own more than 45% of all bitcoins out there
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:45:33
Nice to know, thank you
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:41:50
Just check the daily volume. Last day:
mt gox   - 35682 BTC, btc china - 63803 BTC almost double
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:51:52
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:39:51
Just wait for couple next days, until it is back to "mean". 280-350 dollars (real price), and then buy. And see it slowly re-gain its value again.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:19:56
Can someone just tell that these numbers aren't correct ? I really believe in bitcoin. But these massive owners can really effect the market one day. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:50:23
Would it be possible to create volume pie for other markets like (Btc-e), I really love this feature for MtGox. 
I don't know if it's a bug, but when you choose candlestick chart, and you hover volume bars, it doesn't show the volume.
And the BTC China, it would've been really nice if it would also show converted price to USD dollars, but this doesn't really matter  because that market is dead now.
And ability to filter out small volumes would be great too. 
Keep up with this great work! Thank you.

How stupid are they? Bitcoin had to name "mining" somehow differently... this is so confusing for so many
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:02:34
Thank You, now I understand
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:12:30
I hope it won't happen soon
