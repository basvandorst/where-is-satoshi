By the way you discuss the topic, you are far from what I meant by conspiracy theorist. You are what is good about this community. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:48:26
So many pseudo economists on these posts...

The debt to GDP is very high right now because during a recession government can step in and fill the demand side of the economy by borrowing money and buying things and creating jobs. Once the economy sufficiently recovers taxes will increase and the government (is supposed to) pay back its debts. Take a look here.
Debt obviously skyrocketed, but the deficit is slowly decreasing. You're correct that the debt can (and should) be paid back and in a few years it will begain to be paid back (if everything goes according to plan). 
The funny thing is, say inflation is worse than expected and the dollar drops in value compared to other currencies. That makes US goods more desirable to other countries becuase their money goes further in the US. The US will export more goods and the dollar will gain value again.

I'm sure you know better than your doctor as well?

Thanks for the well thought out reply. Regarding the first paragraph, I was just trying to keep it simple, but I think the argument holds if you change 'tomorrow' to 'next year.'
I completely agree with your second point. Throw in the term extremely liquid describing money and I think your spot on. And this system would be perfectly acceptable if deflation was kept to a minimum. But when deflation hits double digits, outside of speculative investment, companies would not be able to attain the same amount of returns as they would by simply holding onto profits in cash. 
I assume one day the world will witness what an economy looks like with extreme deflation and it will be interesting to see the effects.

I agree, but consuming is an entirely different beast than invetment. If a company can buy a machine that increases profits by 3%, but the currency is deflating at 4%, they will not make the investment.
People consume to meet needs and wants. Companies invest to make money. If there are better investments out there (holding money) they will not make the investment.

I agree that alternative currencies are very interesting and could indeed replace fiat currencies, but you're dismissing an entire field of study based upon the fact that economists can't predict what will happen 100% of the time. Of course black swans will occur and no one will see them coming. But what about the other 99% of the time? Should we not even attempt to understand how people interact with each other through trade and investment?
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:35:29
I came off as arrogant and I apologize to both of you. But what am I supposed to argue against here? That the fiat system will collapse? Why will it collapse? Is it just the US fiat system? OP didn't link an article or make a claim outside of the system will commit suicide. You can't argue against that. 
Making outlandish claims all the time hurts what bitcoin is trying to accomplish by making the community appear like a bunch of conspiracy theorists.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:39:48
You are correct. I had forgotten that while the currency was based on precious metals, local governments commissioned the coins be made so those that had to handle money on a regular basis did not have to weigh coins all the time and could trust the purity of the coin. So it was a fiat system to a degree.
But do you think that monetary policy cannot deter hyper inflation by regulating the prime rate?
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:02:55
I don't know how to answer that. Because it's worked so far? lol
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:43:16
Or, you know, for roads and water.
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:43:03
Economics is a social science. You can't conduct experiments and construct theories like you would in other sciences yes. But it's not a bunch of people throwing darts at a target. There seems to be lot of people on that think economists don't know what they're talking about, but then turn around and use economic data to support their agenda. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but just because economics isn't a hard science, the general public neglects the people that spend their lives studying the field.
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:56:38
I think the community as a whole is pretty intelligent and I think that bitcoin could be wildly successful, but posts like this encourage a revulsion of widely accepted economics.
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:06:22
Thanks for explaining. It sounded right, but I didn't know why. Won't the playing field be leveled as economies abroad grow?
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:24:48
Then what fiat systems have collapsed? Genuinely not trying to be rude here. Sorry if I come off that way.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:53:26
I agree completely that other currencies are extremely useful to hedge a fiat system. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:08:05
But doesn't that mean the US sells more of its goods abroad?
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:37:44
You might have me convinced. I'm having a little trouble with this section.
"More generally, what does a 10% deflation rate tell us assuming a constant money supply?  I'm perhaps oversimplifying, but basically it tells us that the economy is growing at around 11.11% a year (with 10% deflation, the purchasing power of every BTC increases 11.11% each year).  So you now have the same amount of money chasing more goods.  If the economy is growing that rapidly, that tells you that there must be lots of investment opportunities with a return of at least 11.11%.  Basically, that's the number to beat.  If you're looking at an investment opportunity with a measly 5% return, deflation is telling you not to waste your time because there are higher and better uses of that capital."
How is the conclusion drawn that the economy is growing rapidly? Japan has suffered from low rates of growth and deflation simultaneously. 
 You're interpretation of the deflation/inflation as the market determined interest rate seems to me as justifiable. I think we can both agree much more than 5% inflation or deflation is bad for an economy.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:58:36
I agree completely. I'm honestly not that informed about Bitcoin, but how deflationary is it expected to be? 1-2% and your argument holds. But it will crowd out investment if it gets much worse than that. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:41:11
Why? If companies/countries didn't want the US dollar they wouldn't sell goods to the US.
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:58:10
So you disregard all economics? What about psychology? You can't build perfect experiments in the field of economics, so you deal with imperfect models. You're not going to get an exact result, but most of the time you can't, even in other sciences. You just have to do the best with what you're given. We can't say with certitude that if the price of coffee goes up, more tea will be consumed. But it's a pretty good assumption that it will and we've seen that in history. Economics tries to fit reality as best as possible and to do that economists have to make assumptions about how people think and rationalize things. So obviously economists will come to different conclusions about certain things. But it's ignorant to say economics is the same thing as alchemy.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:23:09
I agree, but burden of proof doesn't lie with me. I don't know why he thinks the fiat system will fail. I'm assuming it's because of the debt level seeing that he linked the debt clock. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:57:43
How is a currency based on precious metals a fiat system?
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:21:08
So you own a company and want to invest 10 units of money into production (new factory). With a deflationary currency, if you wait until tomorrow, you can effectively invest 11 units of money. Deflationary currency suspends and hinders investment. This is bad.
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:56:24
I didn't say you shouldn't voice your opinion, just don't pretend your opinion is on the same playing field as those that dedicate their lives to studying their field. Not saying that you did, but OP makes an outrageous claim with no evidence to support it. Do you expect an undergrad studying biology to claim the theory of evolution will not stand the test of time, but not back up his claim? It's insulting.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:08:57
So I'm assuming you don't believe monetary policy has helped in the recent recession? The low cost of credit encourages investments. Isn't it generally accepted that high interest rates exasperated the Great Depression?
And can't the same thing happen with bitcoins? As wallets are lost, won't there be less money chasing the same number of goods? This doesn't mean the economy is growing quicker than the currency is deflated in value.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:27:33
The world economy is so interconnected at this point though. Why would China, which has such a huge stake in the health of the US economy, try to undermine the system? Yes, they could feasibly drop the dollar as a reserve currency, but they don't want to collapse the system. 
But you're right, 1000 things could go wrong and cause the whole economy to come tumbling down. I think for me it comes down to the fact that I recognize the value of monetary policy and put my trust in the US government. Maybe unjustifiably so, but there you have it.

Will you be my financial advisor please?
@_date: 2014-04-10 10:45:46
(in my opinion)
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:01:33
I don't think it was veiled at all. So many think that because they've read a few blogs or taken a class in college, they have the insider scoop on the US financial system. Do I completely trust the US government to always do what is best for the country as a whole? No. Do I delude myself into thinking that the whole system will come tumbling down because of debt? Hell no.
Bitcoin is interesting and has potential to be incredibly useful. But don't cast it as the miracle drug to the imminent financial meltdown of the world economy.
