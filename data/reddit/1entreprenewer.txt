Rallying a bunch of friends to donate to charities that promote peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Hope you'll consider!

This is so incredible. Way to go. A total inspiration to us all. This is WELL worth any downwards price pressure that may happen as these charities liquidate :D

Wow. Donating now. He was the one who convinced me to get into Bitcoin.

Afraid not. They blocked me from sending any wire transfers to ItBit, when I called, they said they won't allow any transaction to or from a Bitcoin exchange at all.

Thanks for sharing this. I was getting sucked in to all the Ether hype, ICO's, "The flippening," etc, and starting to doubt my confidence in Bitcoin as the dominant leader. I'll still hold on to some Ξ, but for now, the lion's share of my stuff will remain securely in my Bitcoin paper wallet (At least until Trezor 2 comes out)

Just wanted to say I'm really touched by the friendly response here - what a warm and welcoming community you guys are. Other subreddits I've posted in in the past about other interests of mine have been less friendly, but maybe I'll start spending some more time on Reddit because of you guys :)

Yep, BofA was good to me, sad that I had to switch banks because they denied my new company.

That's great! What plugin are you using? We have a workaround with Coinsimple + Zapier

I'm a little late to the Bitcoin game, I admit. It took a good friend pitching me on it and sharing some of Andreas Antonopolous' work with me for me to really "get it."
