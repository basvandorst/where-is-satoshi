There aren’t many options for people to impulse purchase bitcoin. GDAX, Gemini and Kraken are probably the best ways, and most people are just going to have to wait on approval processes. Bitcoin ATM’s are good if available to you but remember average price is 9% higher than market price. That’s double Coinbase fees.

You are correct on the first exchange. For the second transaction, your cost basis for whatever number of coins you receive will be the value of the bitcoin at the time of the trade. You can include fees, transfer costs, etc in your cost basis. So when you go to exchange the second coin, the cost basis is $14,300 and price per coin $14,300/# of coins. 
Edit to add: you can use any of the popular sites to estimate value of each trade, just keep a record of how you determined the value.

I agree with your overall premise, but it is almost impossible for the average person with a newfound interest in bitcoin to do this. Barriers to entry are hard to overcome even when using centralized exchanges.
Ideally bitcoin would be completely anonymous, readily available, and cheap and easy to use. I’m just unsure how it gets there. Don’t take my comments the wrong way though, I’m big on bitcoin in particular and crypto overall. But the average bitcoin beginner doesn’t find the path easy to navigate.

You can choose to use the first in first out (FIFO) method which assumes that you sold the first 17 coins that you bought. If you don’t keep any records, this method is the default method that the IRS assumes you are using. 
You can also use last in first out (LIFO) or specifically choose which coins you sold (selected lots.) In general you must pick one method and stick to it when trading in the same account. But you can use different methods for different coins and different exchanges.

The answer is simpler than you’d expect. The US recognizes USD and CAD as currencies. Unless you trade in currencies for the sole purpose of financial gain, you aren’t taxed. The IRS has declared cryptocurrencies as property and does not recognize them as currencies. Therefore they fall under the rules for property exchanges.

At least some tax experts believe you can treat the new coins as another asset received with zero cost basis. That would allow you to hold it long term and only pay cap gains tax when the new coins are sold. Gains taxes may be lower than income tax rates for some people. 
But as others are saying, very grey area, and I don’t expect clarification from the IRS beyond their [2014 Crypto IRS Statement](

2FA and strong passwords are all you can do. You have to leave coins in your exchange account to actively trade frequently. If account is hacked, phished or frozen, or if the exchange suddenly shuts down for whatever reason, the coins will be at risk of loss.

You can’t enter a dollar amount for Limit orders. You specify the amount of currency you wish to buy and the price you’re willing to pay. The total $ amount for that trade displays at the bottom of the order entry box. So you can adjust the numbers to get close to your total amount desired.

The IRS declared in 2014 that cryptocurrencies are treated as property and subject to capital gains taxes. But you only pay taxes or deduct losses when the are realized, i.e. when you sell.

Not really true. Plenty of knowledgeable people post on Reddit about many topics. 
OP, yes sales are taxable events, but if you’ve held more than one year, you may fall below the income thresholds and get by with 0% tax. For 2017, that Limit is $37950 for single filers. If you have a job and file separately from your parents, it doesn’t matter who is on bank account, you’ll be responsible for reporting the transactions. If your parents are very high income earners, it gets more complicated.

The short answer is No.  You record the $$ of that fee and then add it to the cost basis of coins you own. The when you go to sell, you’ve accounted for the fee and actually get a very slight tax break on it. So if you bought $500 worth of bitcoin and then later moved it for $6, you list the original cost basis as $506 when you sell.

If you don’t sell, you have no tax. However, every sale or exchange for another currency results in a reportable transaction. Losses and gains are totaled up, and tax is due if the net is a gain.

Excerpt from our basic bitcoin explanation:
“The complex math involved in the bitcoin software algorithm results in a finite limit of 21 million bitcoins. By mid 2017, there were 16.5 million mined (created). Some of those have been lost forever by individuals who threw away their private keys or devices used for their storage, or who simply forgot about their bitcoins and addresses. The mining difficulty increases over time, so supply will increase at slower rates until 21 million total is reached. The supply will reach the 80% mark in 2018, but isn’t expected to see the 95% point until after 2024.”

Why do you consider it to be either/or?
Dedicated crypto enthusiasts see it as a chance to overthrow the current system. Pure speculators just want to see rapid price increases so they can flip. 
I’m in between, which I suspect is where a lot of bitcoin investors fall. We want to see adoption leading to growth. We see it as a long-term investment worth allocating some portion of our portfolio. 
OTOH, stocks and large corporations aren’t going away. Crypto won’t be building smart phones, cars, or equipment. Bitcoin can’t produce entertainment and content.
So why not invest in both? Or even more than 2 asset classes?  I’m a strong proponent of dollar cost averaging into Vanguard Index funds. Set it and forget it. That will beat most investors over any 5, 10 or 20 year term with little to no effort and very low costs.

The transaction on your end is considered to be a sale of 100 bitcoin at current market price. Tax will depend on your cost basis in that 100 BTC. You’re done as soon as you send the BTC. 
The recipient treatment depends on the nature of their business. It varies highly depending on whether you receive equity, partnership, or income. It depends on whether they use the money for ongoing expenses, salaries, operating costs, startup costs, or return on investment to earlier investors. 
BTC received and immediately converted would be taxed as last paragraph. BTC held and converted later could result in capital gain or loss that has different tax treatment.
This situation needs a business tax pro IMO.

There are no specified transaction reporting requirements when moving money back and forth between accounts. There is no bank report created for sending $10k from Coinbase to your bank account. That myth keeps popping up everywhere.  Depositing $10k in cash or moving $10k across borders raises flags, but not account transfers. 
However you are expected to keep records and pay capital gains taxes. The IRS will continue to prod Coinbase to release all customer records just as a standard brokerage must do. Should you fail to report and the IRS finally starts getting Coinbase or other exchange records, you could face steep penalties or even jail time.

You’d have to report the sale as separate transactions for each purchase if you want to follow the rules to the letter. 
But some authors feel you can make one large sale, add up the total cost basis of all the small purchases and report it as one transaction on form 8949. It is allowable to use the term “various” under the purchase date section. And using average buy price is legal for mutual funds. For crypto, the regulations are still vague. 
So if you sold $5k in bitcoin all at once but bought it with 20 orders in 2017, you could list the sale proceeds and add up all the costs to report total cost as one transaction. 
I’m guessing a reasonable attempt at reporting the sale, the proceeds, the cost and the net gain for taxes will pass the IRS review. But you will have to separate coins bought longer than one year ago from coins owned less than one year when sold. 
Start with our tax articles. Also note those income thresholds below which you don’t have to pay long term capital gains taxes. There are no exclusions for short term gains though.

The short answer is that the US expects everyone with US citizenship to report income and gains from any offshore accounts and pay taxes on it. There’s even a special form for people with foreign assets. 
Of course, a VPN, private account and private addresses could make things more difficult to track. But eventually you may need to cash out and receive USD, and that would be the starting point for investigation.

Yes people have done it. 
I’ve seen this question several times here on Reddit. It’s a misconception. People move large amounts of money around all the time. $100k deposits aren’t out of the ordinary for banks. They don’t greet you with armed guards and an IRS agent.
Doctors, lawyers, small businesses, stock investors, real estate companies, individuals who sell a used car or boat for cash and whole host of other individuals regularly deposit and withdraw large amounts. Contrary to rumors on here, deposits over $10k don’t raise big red flags or require personal explanation. 
It’s not the big deal Redditors make it out to be.

Depends on whose answer you want. They are investment assets according to most regulatory bodies and governments. And their stance is really the only one that matters. 
Of course, their stance could and possibly should change. And each cryptocurrency could be categorized differently. Some may be investment assets, some may be currencies and some may end up being securities.
My personal opinion? They are all of the above and none of the above. They are a brand new entity that needs a separate classification with their own set of rules, policies and regulations.
@_date: 2019-06-15 20:24:34
For currencies created solely for transactions, regulators should monitor for fraud but keep taxes away. You should be able to spend crypto without reporting every transaction. 
Some cryptos used for project fundraising probably meet the definition of a security and should be treated as such. The platform currencies such as NEO and ETH should be left alone, but projects built on them would need to be treated appropriately depending on what they do. For example, a game built on the ethereum VM that uses micro transactions to run shouldn’t be taxed or regulated. But a gambling app would need to follow regulations of each country on gambling, and wins/losses should fall under tax laws. 
I don’t envy regulators dealing with this. Making it all that much harder is that many current altcoins are junk, have no use, and don’t really have a defined function. So how do you treat those? Probably like currency trading is treated until they fail. 
Apps designed to record data on land records, medical records, or other data should also not be taxed. Right now, almost all crypto isn’t being used for anything other than trading and investing though. As long as that remains the case, taxes will be the focus. To spur true development, tax reporting and tax rates need serious reform. Can you imagine paying taxes on every microtransaction in a current mobile gaming app? Of course not, so why pay taxes on ethereum because it has changed price since you downloaded the game?
So taxation is probably the biggest hindrance to moving forward IMO.

The short answer to both questions is “yes.” The IRS currently expects anyone using bitcoin and crypto for purchases to record the USD value at the time of exchange and calculate the net gain/loss from current value and original cost. Assuming you are in the US, of course.

Thanks  
No cap as long as you match short term gains to short term losses and same for long term. However, if you have a net loss for the year, I believe you are limited to deducting $3,000 against your other income. If your losses are higher, you can carry them over to the next year to use again against gains. 
Yes. Record keeping a nightmare. Like kind exchanges would be perfect but in the absence of a direct statement on that from the IRS, many accountants advise against trying it. 
Wash sales are an interesting twist. Selling and then rebuying the same currency within 30 days likely is a wash sale. Are bitcoin and Ethereum similar enough to trigger it? Is all of crypto similar enough to be considered wash sales? I don’t think anyone has the answer. Again no direct statement from the IRS.
I’ll see if we can dig more up in those questions next week. Thanks again for reading.

Worse than long-term gains rates. Equal to short-term rates.
For the OP, mining is considered a business. You complete a schedule C with income from mining less expenses. It’s the same for any business owner. Crypto mining business isn’t harder or more arcane. If you run a business, taxes are part of the deal.
For capital gains, you’re looking at [schedule D completion. ]( and [filling out form 8949.]( 
For frequent traders, it’s a mess. For miners, just record your bitcoin received at the current trading price as income. If you immediately convert, it’s simply reported as business income. If you hold it and sell later, you may have to do both income and capital gains forms. That’s a greater PITA. You may have a gain or loss on the original amount received. 
In that case, it does become more complex.

Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property?
A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, such as whether a loss is deductible.

If you’ve purchased crypto on an exchange, every transfer made after that can be traced regardless of how you try to hide your identity. If you’ve purchased bitcoin with cash so that your identity has never been associated with any bitcoin address, then you may be able to move it around anonymously. 
As far as reporting goes and refusing to do their job for them, it’s no different for any other investment asset. Records and reporting are the same. The difference is that stock accounts will send you a downloadable summary of gains and losses where crypto exchanges are not yet doing that. 
So the exchanges are to blame for the extra work of reporting, not the IRS. And no, I’m not a fan of the IRS or bitcoin taxation. I just happen to know the rules well.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:48:56

I’m going to argue the opposite. Carrying the private keys to your blockchain addresses is the same as carrying your bank account passwords in a password manager app. Carrying a bitcoin paper wallet is the same as carrying a checkbook. Both need action to spend. Both need a signature, one manual and one digital. 
Since the actual currency is stored in a public address on the blockchain, you aren’t “carrying” it.
But I’m not a lawyer nor do I work for the government so YMMV.

Take advantage of both. Divide your initial investment into 3-4 segments. Buy with the first portion now and place limit orders for 2-3 more buys 5, 10, and 15% off current price (or whatever intervals you want). Reassess tomorrow. That’s not dollar cost averaging, BTW. It’s a tiered order strategy that works well when entering or exiting markets. Allows some volatility protection.

Customs asks about carrying cash into the country for money laundering purposes, not tax reasons. The two issues are separate. They don’t want travelers coming and going with large amounts of cash without declaring it. It isn’t illegal to have $15k in cash, but you’ll have to explain it satisfactorily to a customs agent. 
You won’t get tagged by customs for having a bitcoin address in your suitcase or on your phone at the airport. And the question only applies to international return trips to the US. Carry as mush as you want between domestic airports. No one cares.

This isn’t correct.  He would list 2 transactions on form 8949
1st trans: Sold 1 BTC $200 less cost $100 = $100 gain
2nd trans Sold 1 BTC $50  less cost $100   +$-50 (loss)
Net gain for both transactions                         =$50
Tax due on $50 gain. 
You must match up all short-term and long-term transactions this way on form 8949 and then carry net totals to schedule D.
If net capital gains is a loss, you can deduct up to $3000 against your income and the can carry the rest of the loss over to use against gains next year.

That would only be true if bitcoin price appreciates a lot more than stock market prices. 
Neither bitcoin nor the stock market will be going away anytime soon. And none of us know which will have better returns over the next decade. Inflation won’t go away just because bitcoin finds uses. 
These either/or winner/loser binary scenarios constantly posted on reddit widely miss the mark. Why would the existence of cryptocurrency make Apple Corp stock worthless?  Why would using bitcoin make owning GMC, MSFT, Google, FB or any other company stock unprofitable?
The two things aren’t related. Whether or not you use a broker or financial advisor, they aren’t going away due to crypto. BTW, I’m not one, I don’t use one, and I don’t listen to any of them. But bitcoin won’t put them out of business. 
They make their money trading stocks in your account.  They make their commissions whether stocks are up or down. They are the ultimate bookies. And they will just adjust to include crypto in their offerings, continuing to charge commissions whether bitcoin rises or falls.

GDAX is an exchange used for trading between buyers and sellers. In order to buy from someone offering coins for sale, you must have money to cover it immediately. 
Coinbase adds a layer by acting as a buyer or seller. When you place an order there, they act as a middleman by buying the underlying coin on their GDAX exchange and then holding it until your payment clears. They pool a large amount of bitcoin for this escrow service. 
Buyers and sellers in GDAX can’t hold the coins in escrow waiting for payment. Those trades are between individuals and must be instant.

It’s a balancing act basically. If you move small amounts of coins to private wallets regularly, fees take a bigger chunk. Leaving coins on the exchange keeps them exposed to hacking, exchange shut downs, technical glitches, regulations and so on. 
The middle of the road answer is to accumulate enough bitcoin such that you have lower percentage fee to move it. For example, you may wish to buy weekly but only transfer out monthly. 
Think about a personal limit on what would significantly affect you if stolen, and never exceed that limit in your exchange accounts. That number will be different for everyone. $100? $1,000?  $25,000?  It’s up to the individual to decide.

If it held outside of an IRA, you’ll have to pay taxes on any gains from selling the asset, depending on your adjusted gross income. Married couples filing jointly have no gains tax liabilities if income is less than $75,900, individuals is less,than $37,950.

They aren’t taxable until you sell. Splitting and claiming them is not a taxable event. Selling them will result in taxable gains as the cost basis will be zero. You could use average cost method and merge basis with the associated bitcoin, but that would get messy if you sell partial lots.

Short answer is No problems cashing out. No problems holding USD in Coinbase as well since they are FDIC insured. 
There are a lot of misconceptions out there about $10k transfers being flagged as suspicious causing tax headaches or investigations. This isn’t true. People move tens or hundreds of thousands around from brokerages to banks all the time. Coinbase cash back to your bank isn’t a red flag, doesn’t need to be reported and won’t get you in trouble. Just keep tax records of gains.

Bitcoin Cash was forked from bitcoin blockchain back in August. People are buying BCH with BTC because they want to own that coin instead of legacy bitcoin.  BCH trades separately as another coin just as all coins. You’ve bought bitcoin the original. You are invested in BTC. Other coins are usually bought using bitcoin rather than USD. 
People refer to this as trading, swapping, converting, moving over, etc. In reality, they are selling BTC to buy BCH but skipping the intermediate step to USD. So they will have BCH by getting rid of BTC. 
If it was your desire to invest in bitcoin, then you don’t need to do anything else. Coinbase and GDAX don’t trade in BCH. 
Here are a couple of beginner’s articles on our new site.

“Scenario 1: network is unusable
If support for the fork remains at current levels, or decreases, there will not be a functioning Bitcoin2x network. GDAX will not support withdrawals or trading as it will be impossible to send funds to GDAX, or withdraw funds from GDAX. Currently we believe this is the most likely scenario.
If the network gains support at a later date, we will enable Bitcoin2x withdrawals from the platform.

If transactions are being confirmed at a reasonable speed, and miner support is strong, we will allow GDAX customers to withdraw Bitcoin2x. We will not enable trading as previously stated, but we may enable trading at a later date.”

It’s really entirely a personal decision. What amount makes you nervous or significantly alters your life should the account be hacked or the exchange go down?
For some that might be a few hundred dollars. For others it may be 10’s of thousands. 
Private wallets, hardware, software or paper, give you full control over your funds, but there can be security issues setting them up and possibilities of mistakes while using.
Screwing up and sending coins to the wrong address or incorrect type of wallet is just as bad as having someone hack your account. 
It isn’t quite as cut and dry as some believe.

Maybe I’m not following your question, but you would move funds to an exchange, sell bitcoin, and then transfer out to another account. How quickly you sell would be up to you. 
Exchange withdrawal limits can be raised upon request for people with large holdings. I know users with $50-100k daily withdrawal limits. 
If you wish to sell $500k of bitcoin for cash, I don’t have any suggestions. I would think the risks of peer to peer exchange for half a million cash would keep me up at night.

IF the fork occurs and both coins receive miner support, then you will be credited with equal number of B2X once Coinbase and other exchanges, wallets, etc decide how to securely split them out. 
You’ll receive a Coinbase (or other exchange) notice if/when that applies. 
The likeliest scenario is that nothing will happen. But who knows anymore really. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:18:23
No. Nothing to see here. Nothing to do. On the off chance that S2X happens, you’d get the additional forked coin. Otherwise nothing changes.

That is an incomplete view. A Ponzi scheme relies on recruiting new money and using that new money to pay the earlier investors their “guaranteed big returns”. 
When you buy bitcoin, you are taking possession of an asset. You always own that asset. The money you used to buy that asset went to the directly seller of that asset. There is no recruitment, there is no redistribution of funds. The market determines the value of that asset, not some super secret investor promising returns. 
I think the analogy you meant to use is the greater fool theory which means essentially that you make money by selling a worthless asset to the next fool in line willing to pay you more for it than you paid. And so on. 
Bitcoin is not a Ponzi. I believe it is also not an example of the greater fool theory as well. But I could be a fool so who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:26:09
That is correct. The IRS treats all purchases as a sale of the asset used. So you’d owe tax on difference between what the $50 worth of bitcoin cost. 
You’re expected to keep records and classify as short or long term gains.

Or the price went higher because buyers hoped to get the split coins. 
Just reject all the split coins and never worry about them again. Donate them and write them off. 
You have no idea what bitcoin price would be had their not been forks. No one does. It’s pure speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:29:01
When buying small amounts be very careful of fees. Although fee schedules are calculated as a percentage, many exchanges have a minimum fee. $3 for every $10-20 worth means you’re starting with 15-30% loss right out of the gate. 
Save a little each week until you can muster a larger buy to at least reduce fees.

There is no reporting burden with dollar cost averaging buys. Taxable events include sales, receiving coins in airdrops and of course forks. You can buy every week, month or quarter and not worry about reporting until you sell.

They do, in the form of a deduction for the loss. At the same rate the gains are taxed. So losses get the same treatment as gains.
I can’t believe it’s 2019 and people still don’t know cryptocurrency is subject to taxes just like other investment asset. It isn’t a currency in opinion of several governments, but it is in others.

Boss at job or customer paying as independent contractor?
First scenario: employer has to pay social security, benefits, payroll taxes, etc in fiat and then pay you final net amount. Boss would have to take net, convert to crypto at exchange with fees and then pay fees to send. All this occurs while price fluctuates which could result in more tax headaches. 
Freelancer: customer can buy crypto on exchange and immediately pass it on to the freelancer by just recording the transaction but there are no good payroll software or vendors accounting packages that will automatically handle this. Each payment would be manually created. Royal PITA for a business.

Ease of use
95% of the world’s banked population don’t give a rat’s ass about anything else. Customer tracking, ads, giving away personal info?  Hell, most of the crypto sites I visit ask for all of that and every browser I use tracks all of that.
Your responses in general push bitcoin into the illegal activity niche where you can get around prohibited items lists and consumer tracking.
Mainstream adoption: cheaper, easier and faster.  That’s it. 
My credit card gives me frequent flyer miles, access to first class lounge in certain airports, travel and rental car insurance, fraud protection, ability to challenge a transaction, approval within seconds, theft protection and no cost (to me) to use, and it’s as easy as insert chip or pay with fingerprint phone unlock. No interest when balance is paid each month, and I do. No need to carry cash. 
Crypto is competing against that. Until it exceeds those standards, it will not be adopted. I believe it will, but we are further from that than many are willing to accept or admit.

If a digital crypto payment system exists from end to end, you can choose your funds in any way you see fit. So if you want hookers and blow, buy them. If you want AAPL or MSFT stock,  buy them. Want real estate? Buy it, use digital smart escrow for safety, research the blockchain property record quickly and cheaply, complete the purchase, find tenants using their blockchain records to make sure they are legit then charge them rent in digital currency. 
I think you’re missing the point. It isn’t about what you choose to invest in, the OP asked why bitcoin would have utility. It will if it sees full adoption as a global currency. No one in 1995 would’ve believed they would be paying for goods and services digitally 15 years later. Very few predicted the sea change that the internet brought to society. One or a few digital currencies as well as utility blockchains will transform and disrupt in similar or greater degree 5-10 years from now.

This isn’t true. Wallet transfers have nothing to do with determining taxes. Selling bitcoin for USD or other altcoins triggers a reportable trade for tax calculations.
To the OP: keep records of all buys and sells. Date, total cost for buys including fees, total proceeds from sales minus fees, amount of coin purchased and cost per coin. That data will be needed when filing tax returns later.

Until a crypto is faster, cheaper and at least as easy to use as a credit or debit card, it will not see major adoption. Until purchase reversals and refunds can be made a serious option, bitcoin purchases require just as much “trust” as a bank or credit card controlled purchase. 
The only way to change that is to be faster, cheaper and easier. Otherwise it will remain a fringe technology.

Longer term you can be hacked or phished no matter how sophisticated your security procedures are. Again, $300 is a lot to some people but nothing to others. Convenience, security and overall risk need to be considered when deciding what to do. 
Ledger Nano S is reasonably priced and easy to use.  Trezor is more expensive but also easy to use. If you plan on adding to your bitcoin investments, it’s worth budgeting for one of those.

 Nope. Blaming a tool for a bad result is the facepalm here. And it took all of those technologies time to develop into the useful tools that they are. Crypto is no more a direct cause of death than US dollars, cell phones, cars, beepers, computers, landline phones or any other technology. 
It’s easy to label something as a direct cause of a negative outcome. It also greatly oversimplifies the problem and is purely disingenuous coming from a man responsible for enough technology to disrupt world governments and economies.

It’s the exchanges that have an 18 yo minimum age requirement for registration and purchase.
The typical answer is to ask your parents but many parents don’t trust the bitcoin ecosystem or understand that there are legitimate trustable exchanges. Most adults still believe it’s all a scam and/or a terrible investment. So for the under 18 crowd, there aren’t many options. Finding a helpful friend can be dangerous because the friend can run off with your money and also be charged with running an unlicensed money exchange service. So it’s a problem.
OP. I wrote this a few years ago FWIW to encourage older investors to make an attempt to understand bitcoin. Maybe your parents can browse around the site and find a few helpful tip. I’m not shilling the site, I’ve abandoned it and it receives no traffic. It will likely be taken down soon, but maybe it can help your parents understand. 
We also created a more serious site where adults can ask questions and get complete answers and/or have conversations about these topics.

You don’t get double really. You get an amount of the newly forked coin equal to the amount of bitcoins you were holding at the time of any fork.  One fork, bitcoin, will continue as is and will be traded as BTC like always. The blockchains share history up to the fork then diverge as new ledgers. 
Any newly forked coin will only have value based on whatever the market values it at. Right now, BTG isn’t traded on any exchange and doesn’t have an established value. OTOH, bitcoin cash continues to be traded around $325 today after hitting a high in July of around $900. 
It remains to be seen whether BTG will become stable with replay protection and other issues fixed and then have trading/spending value. Same with the upcoming Segwit 2X forked coin.  2 blockchains will be created, value and support for new coin will be determined by markets and miners.

It is not contradictory. Gains in an IRA are tax-deferred. You can buy and sell as often as you want without tax consequences. OTOH, if all you plan on doing in either case is holding, then capital gains tax when you do sell bitcoin outside of an IRA may be cheaper than the income tax rate charged on IRA payouts. So there are things to consider. 
But it takes only a couple of trades outside of the IRA to wipe out any tax savings from the lower capital gains tax rates.

Besides trust issues, the buyer would not be able to re-sell the acquired bitcoin. If investment is the intention, this would be a limiting factor.

It’s too volatile for one.  Transaction permanence leaves buyers no recourse but to trust sellers that purchases are as advertised. No other ways to reverse a transaction but to hope the other party agrees. Still not easily obtainable for average consumers. Requires a conversion for use.  Inconvenient to add a transition step between paying with fiat or credit card.  Speed still slower than credit card or fiat.
Early adopters still drive this. Until an entire system springs up where consumers get paid directly in crypto and can therefore use it without extra steps and fees, it will remain fringe.

IRAs, 401K’s and every tax deferred investment plan is for people who CAN do math. You have things quite backwards. And most people end up in a lower tax bracket after retirement because they are no longer earning an income but instead living off of their investments. 
You appear to need a basic course in tax brackets. Higher tax bracket means you have a higher income. That’s a good thing, not bad. And tax rates are progressive.  Moving into a higher bracket doesn’t raise the taxes on the lower portions of your income. The higher rates only apply to amounts above each bracket limit. So when you move to a higher bracket, your net income is higher.  You aren’t punished by making more, but you do keep less of the amount over the limit. 
So tell us again how being in a higher tax bracket is a bad thing.  Tax deferred investing works for any asset class. It’s the entire idea behind becoming wealthy. Anything you can do to defer taxes as long as possible is worthwhile. Whether it’s in stocks, bonds, real estate or bitcoin. You always want to maximize your tax deferred investments.
@_date: 2019-09-07 19:24:02
I do agree with his comment about moving your retirement money into total market index funds if you plan on buying bitcoin outside of it. 
There’s one situation to consider. Retirement withdrawals are taxed at your regular income rate. Long term capital gains are taxed at 15 or 20% (zero if your income is low.) So if you expect to hold bitcoin for the long-term, you could be better off net return by keeping index mutual funds in retirement fund and bitcoin in personal investments. 
That’s because mutual funds pay capital gains and dividends each year, so holding them outside of a retirement fund requires paying taxes on those each year. You avoid that in an IRA/401K. But if you trade in and out of bitcoin rather than just holding it, you’ll generate taxable trades each time. In that case, the IRA protects you from paying short term taxes on those trades. 
But you will still pay income tax at the time you start taking withdrawals regardless of how you take them. Your bracket may be higher or lower than capital gains brackets. So take a look at all of that to decide where to put stocks/mutual funds versus bitcoin.
Bitcoin IRAs are a little wonky still, and fees are high because competition is low. So the decision is more complicated. I just answered your original post specifically.
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:39:05
He didn’t state his intent. Some trade bitcoin short-term. If that’s a goal, then there has to be an easier entry and exit technique. Others might find themselves over-extended financially and need to sell. Still others may want to sell a portion if prices jump quickly. Just another factor to keep in mind. 
@_date: 2019-09-06 23:22:17
You pay taxes either way. How much you pay depends on how much you trade and how you buy the asset.
“Not your keys, not your bitcoin?”  Yeah that went away in 2017. You can hold onto that premise, or you can adapt and invest in more tax efficient ways. 
Plenty of fiduciaries will be holding bitcoin for customers in the future. It’s the only way the space will grow as an investment. When Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and other players finally offer bitcoin to their customers, they won’t be transferring it to private addresses. 
So get ready for that.

Like everyone else here, I concur with the don’t short-term or day trade policy. But you can use some tricks to lower your costs of entry like placing a ladder of limit orders to try and buy dips automatically since you can’t watch 24/7. Also, you need to use an exchange with low fees. 
I like Coinbase Pro enough that I wrote a quick [guide to using CBP. ]( 
Others aren’t fond of the entire Coinbase system and use Bittrex or Poloniex, which are my go to exchanges for altcoins not available on Coinbase Pro. 
But don’t day trade. You will be done in days to weeks. You might get lucky at first if the market swings in your favor, but long-term the vast majority lose and give up. Buy and hold, getting the best prices and lowest fees you can on the entry points.

If you’re thinking all bitcoin, consider breaking the $10k into 5 or even 10 smaller dollar amounts. Set a schedule to buy a set amount at a set time interval until you’re 100% in. For example, buy $1,000 worth of bitcoin every Monday at noon for the next 10 weeks. Emotionally you’ll feel good if prices head up because you have some bitcoin.

Stock and options traders can get around this by just reporting summaries. However, the IRS allows this as long as exchanges report your info on a 1099 that the IRS cam use to verify your numbers. With crypto, most won’t get a 1099. If you look closely at form 8949, you’ll notice options A, B and C, one of which must be selected which determines how you need to file. 
The only applicable option for crypto traders is C transactions not reported on form 1099-B. In that case, form 8949 instructions state to report all trades.  I covered this briefly in my [guide to form 8949](
