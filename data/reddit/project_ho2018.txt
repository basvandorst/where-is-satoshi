Haha, seriously.
Nerds on here trying to sound smart would sound smarter if they never said anything.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:02:16
That's the nice things about most first world countries.
They stop having kids in a recession so there isn't over crowding.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:28:35
I can't tell if you're being serious.
A person can write a comment with an intention and have that intention be obvious by clues/anomalies in their writings.
But I'm sure you're smart and knew that already.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:02:56
That sounds like that might be some type of political reference to WW1 or WW2, but I don't know history or understand politics.

RemindMe! Ey yo, peep this Bitcoin shizz
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:36:01
Yup he nailed it and I'm going to try the 50/50 percentage asset allocation now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:37:43
One more reason why Bitcoin sucks.
I've had issues making transactions that have already cost me thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:29:31
HODL is just a typo meme?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:59:09
Ah thanks.
It's nice to feel validated.
Part of the Bitcoin rise is due to it's name and since Litecoin is the second most popular, I figured it would have similar effects.
Etherium is on Coinbase along with those two and the 3rd most popular and the one that's shown the strongest growth long term, which emotional/greedy gamblers/"investors" ignored.
I figured the strong rise would follow with the emotional high running out, possible withdrawal from big investors "painting the tape" and people cashing out for x-mas.
I think Bitcoin might be dead at this point since it took a few minutes to download the first few years of the ledger and hours to download the last few months when I bought at $4k.
Here a video showing the average "investor" on Reddit in a few seconds of this video clip.
Also, people say you can use Bitcoin anonymously?
That's the dumbest thing I've heard.
It's anything BUT anonymous.
I submitted my drivers liscence to get a coinbase account, had to verify that with 1-3 bank accounts, an e-mail account AND phone verification for every login.
Not to mention isn't the whole point that there's a PUBLIC ledger and nothing online is anonymous since even words you use and the rhythm you type with can be used as a fingerprint to identify a person, not to mention info from browser like screen size, ip, dns leaking, etc. etc. etc.
Also, I'm going to trust all the faceless accounts which could easily be idiots buying into information spoon fed to them from goverment and investors looking to cheat the system.

Hindsight is 20 20.
Statistically speaking, she would have been right in 99.999 other instances.
Unless you're somebody at the top who has access to trends and information globally, there's little to no way to have predicted Bitcoin getting so big. 
Look at any financial predictions from the past and people are rarely aware of things the small percentage saw warning signs for.
Most home mortgage lenders saw the indications of a financial collapse/bubble, but they wouldn't tell anybody because they're trying to make money.
Robert Kiyosaki and Peter Schiff have been pretty consistent/accurate when it looked like they were trying to profit off of fear mongering.
But anybody who saw global competition with the internet could have seen the recession from a mile away.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:29
Are you saying there's no truth to the "gay frogs" thing?
Last I heard, that was real.
Have you seen Jurassic Park?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:08:32
Well, you're saying it's a challenge to their power as if they SHOULD be using it, when it's the complete opposite.
Nobody even knows who made Bitcoin (likely to be somebody working with the U.S. government, such probably Israeli intelligence).
The idea of China, now a growing super power with lots of American debt, to suddenly use a brand new form of unstable currency which could easily be wiped out by the invisible people who've invested the most in it or whatever agency has strong enough computers to mess with the system.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:32:41
Because you don't have it until it's liquidated. 
Don't count your chickens until they hatch.
Heard somebody yesterday brag about how me put money on Bitcoin that day and made more money.
Well, I didn't hear about him taking it out, so I presume if the value crashed/Bitcoin disappeared, he'd have less money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:47:47
You reply: FINE THEN!
Me: SO IT'S SETTLED
You, crossing arms: SO IT IS THEN. (looks away)
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:50:40
I just moved my Bitcoin to Etherium, as I see people have been selling theirs to invest in Bitcoin and less as much, litecoin.
Well, based on the trends/graph.
So Bitcoin should dip the most, then lightcoin, and etherium should have the strongest rise in comparison to factor in market corrections.
How does this sound?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:29:22
Just trying to think of memes from around the Darude Sandstorm time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:40:18
Confirmation bias and people want to inflate the price themselves so they can sell.
I personally don't have control over a website like reddit which can publish something that makes Bitcoin double in price in a matter of weeks.
Same people who edit people's account comments for being the 50% of America who voted one way in an election over another.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:28:25
What show is this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:48:49
RemindMe! 1 year "Ey yo, peep this Bitcoin shizz"

Then I took an arrow to the knee.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:45:37
I've already had cards put on holds by two different banks while trying to buy Bitcoin.
I'm most cases, despite what people say, Bitcoin is NOT better than cash in most regards.
It's more like a stock than an actual currency, but it has "coin" in the name and pictures of it look like gold coins, so that must confuse people I guess.
China is against bitcoin, and America seems to be allies with them/owe them money, so...
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:57:55
Please stop harassing me.

Rural areas of Germany?
That sounds like a dream come true to me.
Get a house out there and whittle things out of wood.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:28:56
I should be responding to comments like yours, not griefers.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:26:40
Educated stab in the dark.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:01:10
That's what I thought to, but it's almost as if you're trying to correct me, but I don't see what on.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:57:39
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:27:11
No, you can look the word up with you like.
It's a way of describing your comments.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:51:16
Unless the value goes down, then you want to kys.

A post about it being over 9000 on reddit doesn't hurt, or the twitter front page headline, etc.
But yes, Twitter/Reddit would never manipulate the financial market.
Just Wallstreet.

lol, I told all you guys and you were all just like, "HODL"
Fucking retards.

Nobody on the internet ever lies.
Just remember that.
