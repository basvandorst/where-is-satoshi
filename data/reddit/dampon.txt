Storing value in money is a waste. The point of inflationary currency is to stimulate investment. Money is not a store of value. Money is to be used to buy actual stores of value.
Reducing the velocity of money is a great way to destroy the economy.

Bitcoin users being incels? No, it couldn't be true.

PlanB's argument is garbage. Scarcity alone is not what drives price.
And Vijay's argument is pretty bad as well. As the purpose of currency is not to be a store of value, but to be used to buy things that are useful/ store's of value/investments. What he is arguing for is a digital gold, not a replacement for fiat currency, which what Bitcoins Stans claim it will be.

If that's true you should sell your house and go all in on leverage dude!

There is also tons of evidence that says a low rate of inflation is very good for the economy.
But I know you don't care about that.

Since 2014. And I still have yet to see anything that makes it valuable other than cult following. Hardly anyone uses it as a currency and it has tiny trading volume.
Like I said, everyone here sees it as digital gold, not digital currency. Which is why it is doomed to fail. Because unlike Bitcoin, gold is a material that actually has uses outside of a store of value.
Not to mention the entire idea of deflationary currency is retarded to begin with.

It's a terrible argument. Scarcity alone does not drive value.
My finger nail clippings are scarce. No one is clamoring over them.

Yes. To exchange it short term. Not to keep it under your mattress. There is no value added holding onto money. Your money should be put to use buying stocks, real estate, bonds, etc.
Bitcoin will never be a thing until most of the people buying it view it as a currency instead of a speculative asset. As of now, it's no different from Beanie Babies.
