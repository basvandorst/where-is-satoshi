Yeah, I'll try that, but I have done stuff on a lot of exchanges, hope it supports then all
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:14:33
It's a good app, what I like most is the charts, they're isn't any other so that has charts this good. Unfortunately, I have way too much data on Delta to transfer it here.

The point is not if it's needed and it can be needed in situations, the point is there are other currencies that support fast transactions without a side chain.
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:17:33
What if I told you it's not that secure? BitMain owns close to 50% of the network.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:08:55
Well, first, what is Bitcoin Cash? It's made to be a faster version of Bitcoin. Sure, but from the start, there are plenty of alts that are much better at that job. 
Among the top are Litecoin and Ethereum, the traditional coins, then you have IOTA,NEM,XRP and there are a lot others.
Bitcoin Cash at it's current state it's neither fast nor cheap. It's not much better than the original.

That doesn't prevent you from buying it directly from someone. What you're saying can't kill BTC, but it'll make it used even more by criminals.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:21:49
Yes, that is genuinely crappy
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:25:03
Yes, but if at first you put 0.001, then you can't pay more than that, I'm sorry but I'd rather use a full fledged currency.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:27:16
I want to spend more than my first deposit, if for example I want to pay 0.002 and by first deposit was 0.001, I can't, right?
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:33:27
Yes, I know, but until it's full fledged I'll stay away from it
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:54:10
There are privacy coins for that
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:00:10
Bitcoin is a currency the US can't devaluate.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:07:17
So you mean, the amount you send the first time is the maximum amount you can send afterwards. To be honest, that sounds like shit.
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:58:44
Oh I'm no troll. Facts easily prove what I just said.
@_date: 2019-11-19 13:50:54
Well Bitcoin is a shitty currency so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:27:39
Oh man. Reposting this to r/buttcoin
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:33:21
It's an auto correct mistake, I meant total supply.
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:32:16
Yep. Though it isn't a better store of value as well. A "store of value" is seen as a safe investment option. Bitcoin isn't safe at all.
@_date: 2019-11-07 12:07:13
Okay cult-member
@_date: 2019-11-16 18:34:42
You mean like nobody uses Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2019-11-16 14:35:02
Okay so auto correct fucked my sentence a little. I meant about the total supply.
The problem is that close to 50% of the nodes are held by the same entity. What if just 51% of nodes accept the new code?
Bitmain had almost 51% at one point.
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:45:03
Well, they don't need to own the hashrate to wreak havoc.
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:23:49
This isn't really true. You can do much more to the network if you own enough mining power. Bitmain is getting dangerously close to 50%.
Edit: 
@_date: 2019-11-07 12:00:57
Bitcoin is a shit currency without any centralized service to help it become shit. It's shit from the start. Lightning network is not a good solution.
The IRS is constantly tracking it.
It's just a slower way to pay with all of the disadvantages of the fiat system.
@_date: 2019-11-07 11:47:48
Their "managing" or "mismanaging" can make your bitcoins worthless within an instant. 
Bitcoin is not yet decentralized. At least not fully. It's depends on centralized exchanges for it's price.
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:01:09
I did say it might not be possible because of nodes, because I actually remembered that nodes verify the validity of the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:34:48
@_date: 2019-11-07 11:37:49
Lol Bitcoin doesn't make the old system obsolete. Bitcoin is quite worse than the old system and still trackable
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:04:11
Blocking transactions is not enough?
I'm not sure about this, but I think they can push code changes to the blockchain, but maybe not because of the nodes.
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:40:28
Lol don't put Elons face on this. It's straight up misleading. He tried to open a fully electronic bank, nothing to do with crypto.
@_date: 2019-10-29 01:48:37
Banks do not print anything
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:07:53
He's right, though..
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:15:39
The banks do not directly print money. In the US it's the FED, in other countries other entities.

@_date: 2019-12-20 01:03:05
I thought miners already heated up your room?
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:37:29
I'd like my 100M in cash please.
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:25:57
Okay no, that's an Ethereum token
