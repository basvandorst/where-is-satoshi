Considering the top comments on her post revolve around "need a new boyfriend?," "We could get married..." etc., it makes sense why women would feel the need to break away from that.

Get a lawyer.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:21:42
Get better law professors.

We could get married and do butt stuff with our crypto gains

There's a long history that points to exactly this, though.  The fight against central banks in USA goes back to Andrew Jackson... in fact, the American Revolution was mostly started because the colonies started using their own non-inflationary, untaxed currencies (Google "Continental Currency") that England couldn't control.  It's silly to think that rich, smart, powerful people don't scheme occasionally in back rooms; they're environmentally conditioned to be addicted to the power grabs.

UGH, you lost all your BTC because you use phrases like "Chrissy cards" jesus christ that is the cringiest phrase I could ever think of.  Not to mention thinking paper wallets as xmas cards *won't* turn you into *that guy* everyone hates at xmas.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:04:48
I don't mind paying fees.  I Just want to be able to cash out in USD at a foreign exchange.  I tried Blockchain.info before realizing you can't sell for USD, and realized maybe *no* foreign exchange supports this (?)

I did the same.  Stormed into my CEO's office and demanded he tell me what he knows about cryptocurrencies.  That fluffernutter acted all ignorant and started begging for his life, but he knew.  *HE KNEW*.

I still don't understand if my BTC in CoinBase is safe.  I ShapeShifted them into LTC yesterday (and said "fuck" when I saw BTC price today) because it appears CoinBase is going to screw over its users from a discussion on here yesterday (?).  Now I'm wondering if that was just FUD.
