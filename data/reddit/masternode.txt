I both purchase BTC and sell BTC for fiat a number of times a month (as I trade both BTC and Altcoins).  The amounts are typically around $2k-$6k on average but have been as high as $15k.

Lol.  I guess that's why you didn't post it on your own website. Reddit first right?

Are there any other exchanges other than OkCoin where I can trade 20x that aren't shady?  Time to switch.  I've read enough.

PBoC is going to force Chinese exchanges to stop BTC withdrawals all together. The only way to end capital flight from China thru BTC is to stop BTC withdrawals on these exchanges. You will still be able to speculate on price, but you get no utility out of it. All of the BTC sitting on the exchange will eventually cash out to Fiat. This is what is going to cause the impending bloodbath.
In regards to PBoC actions towards BTC there is much more to come. Keep in mind the largest mining pools are in China.

I thought I read they halted withdrawals for 72 hours.

I am typically not hostile on these calls, as I know it gets me nowhere.  As you can see, later I even pointed out to supervisor that I realize it's not her that issued the policy (letting her know if I'm frustrated it's not directed at her).  Oh yea, and I remember for certain stating that I wanted to know so that it wouldn't happen again.

Yup.  Don't really have anything to worry about though, as I don't do anything illicit.  But yea, it could lead to other complications I guess which I have no desire to deal with (i.e. other banks closing me down maybe?)

Goldman Sachs calculated that cumulatively since August 2015 through November 2016, FX outflow for China totaled roughly US$1.1 trillion.  FX Outflow chart avail on tweet below.

Goldman Sachs calculated that cumulatively since August 2015 through November 2016, FX outflow totaled roughly US$1.1 trillion, while implied FX sales suggested by PBOC’s FX position (headline reserves after adjusted for currency valuation effect) were approximately US$630bn (US$540bn), indicating that the real rate of reserve depletion was nearly double that represented by PBOC reserve data. (attached)
Why would China try to misrepresent the full extent of its currency outflows?
Simple: it is an ongoing attempt by the PBOC to not precipitate the feedback loop of even further panicked selling of Yuan, even greater purchasing of Bitcoin, even more outflows, and thus, even more reserve depletion. The PBOC will simply not allow capital flight if their reserves have been and continue to take hits defending the yuan peg.  This is why they are halting BTC withdrawals on Chinese exchanges, because it's the only way to stop capital flight thru BTC.

PBoC is serious about stopping capital flight, not just thru BTC.

Similar event happened to me.  I sold around 8.7668 BTC and they cancelled it on me.  I even have email from them, then i logged onto my coinbase this morning and my BTC were back in my account.  Give me a second to provide screenshots.  In my case I lost almost $1k because of their shenanigans.  (unless of course the $ shows up in my bank account tomorrow)
