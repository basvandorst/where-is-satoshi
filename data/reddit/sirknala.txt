That's like saying you really like vegetables but there's not a lot of vegans or vegan shops so you'll just go back to eating meat.  You vote for who you like, it doesn't matter anyway.

I wonder if it would be possible to create a pool like p2p that does this same hashrate reward disparity in reverse at a logarithmic scale.  So that if you did have more hash-power than your entire p2p chain, your variance would go up instead of down.  I'm not sure if that would encourage more users or not.
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:28:56
It's not a joke.  All the keys are there, you'd just have to be extremely lucky to find one with coins.
@_date: 2014-04-13 03:46:18
I agree.  But as much as I'd love for speculators to be neutral, if we want Bitcoin to succeed as a currency, we'll need some kind of support from banks that can create money out of thin air.
Login to a govt site, lock in 1btc for $1k, wait for the money to arrive... someday.  And if we eventually have a fiat crash and start using seashells for goods and services, peg a seashell to a bitcoin and keep on going.
Because the support would be purposely programmed to be unreliable with randomness, trading would still be the  method of obtaining a return on your investment.  The govt support would only provide a small medium of stability.  It will NOT destroy volatility because you won't be able to trade every single bit for a dollar.
In all fairness, they could do this now without discussion with a more aggressive approach.

Randomly, account balances with other usernames are being leaked when access various pages on bitfinex.com .  After about 5 sec, the page blanks out to white but the sourcecode is still available with the full account details that were visible before.  Sometimes the page remains with your data except for the username.
So far the best method of recreating the bug is with accessing the order book.  This bug can be replicated on an incognito/in private session and with other browsers and computers.  It doesn't require being logged in either.
 &lt;- best method to recreate bug
 - logged in
 - not logged in
This was brought to my attention while online at Tradingview.com.  I didn't believe them at first and then I saw the first one while logged in.
Nothing can be done currently, but it does seem to be a major security risk!
...some sluething on TV's part...
ok lowstrife and I can confirm it is defiantly a cache issue with the CDN. we both route to the same cache server and that makes sense why we are seeing each other's account info. everything is monetarily safe, it's just a read-only account information leak.

Big suggestion: You should create a grading column per category using a script and then an overall ranking column that avgs the amount. Blanks should be 0. You basically already did that with the colors. But since colors can't be auto-aligned...
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:48:37
So, maybe this has already been suggested before but is there an equation or proof to prove that a node is full?  If there is, why aren't we using this to identify full nodes and pay them for the service they provide?  Full nodes could provide a donation address and the network could pay them a percentage of the tx fees?  It doesn't have to be much to encourage people to do this.

Small group choosen at random (salted by previous block) from the bigger group.  There is no communication besides block propogation.  The code rules who is authorized to validate the next block.
No timetables or numbers yet.  Need that whitepaper.  Would love to hear more about this.  Perfection with a bit of ETH smart contracting code.

Its more like a routing protocol where your money finds the cheapest fastest route.  Pure recipients don't need a node, only if they pay out will they require one.
BTW, they are only building the architecture, not the user friendly software were used to.  I'm sure we'll eventually have a killer app that does all the routing and fees for us without errors.

Probably the worst advice I've seen in regards to keeping a canary.
"Its okay if you don't feed it, everyone knows its still alive." Said no miner ever.
Feeding = page updates
Alive = not compromised
Gas = court order
Compromised = pgp sign &gt;30d
And since they haven't fed the canary since October, they are compromised until we see the canary get fed.

LN requires reserve coins for serving as a node.  If the node becomes bad and keeps everything somehow, the reserve is divided up to the other parties as applicable snd that node is blacklisted.  Node only transfer as much as they have in reserve.

Two different communities here... not one.  Besides reddit subscription and price, no on really knows the size of the other so don't brag about size.  What we do know is that big blockers went to r-btc because it was friendly to the conversation. And thats it.  BCH, SEGWIT, S2X could all go to hell if we'd just agree on a larger blocksize.  If r-bitcoin never did what it did, we'd've been/be one big happy family with infighting discussions about blocksize like other normal families.

He was talking about how the community felt about the forks at the time, not the timeline of events that took place.  S2X was preffered over BCH until it failed. BCH was created Aug 1st once it looked like S2X would fail after a couple of deadlines passed for consensus.  The idea of BCH happened long before that.
