MtGox,  BTC-e, Bitcoin24, Bitcoinica, Virwox ... I don't even know how much I lost on all these sites. Maybe something like 5 BTC in total? 
But here is the thing ... those 5 BTC only cost me like 50 USD or something? And so I have gotten more fiat on my bank account then I send on crypto since early 2011. And I am not going to loose 50 000 USD of my own money like so many people here will. Because crypto is bound to go through major corrections just like in 2013. It will happen again and it will cause much hurt .. but when ? Nobody knows. After that is will go up again but at slower rate.

They are still there but they steal your stuff. They don't allow me to log in anymore and keep saying that they can't find my email adress.
I still have 0.1 BTC on there that they stole from me.

Yeah right now about 10% of all transactions are invalid and that's why we need more  full nodes to filter them out. Full node look at the blockchain to figure out if a transaction is trying to spend coins that are really in the database. If not then the full nodes send a message to the miners letting them know that they should not include these transactions in the next block. The reason why the blocks are so full is that there is lots of spam and false transactions. So the more full nodes the better the network works and the easier it is for miners to put valid transactions in to the  blocks and block the spam and the invalid transactions.

See now just from reading a couple of line of what you wrote I can already tell you are a real person with no secret agenda. My main account is banned here but I will contact you from my main account and give you some of my BCH and I will awnser all of your questions myself or forward you to the topics and threads in the past.

Bitcoin = collectors coin. 
The more rare a coin is the more people want to collect it and the more rare it becomes. Then the value goes up.
Of course the value of something essential for human usage will always be higher then the value of some collectors item that does not change anything in the world if you have it or I have it or we don't have it.
So if you think Bitcoin will become successful just as a collectors item you are mistaken. Especially when anybody can create another collectors item by creating another coin. 


It if only facilitates the flow of fiat money the world will still be stuck with fiat money. 


Governments allowing their citizens to pay their taxes in crypto would be a huge succes for crypto.
If crypto offers something of value to society then governments should embrace it because it will be good for them.  
If crypto remains speculative, like gold, but where it's way more easy to sell something fake because you can really say that one crypto is real and another crypto is fake.
Then I full understand while governments are not happy with crypto if they are being used to rip of and defraud their citizens. 
So your way of thinking is part of the problem. The idea of using Bitcoin as currency is the reason why we have Bitcoin in the first place. Nobody got excited in 2009 about a way of "facilitate the flow of money". No, we got excited about a new form of money with possible better properties then current money. 


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.


That's not why it was invented. Even if that is what you would like. That's not why it was created.

Exchange rate is -3.63% lower now. So that's $287,182,600 or a lose of 1 million dollars. It's way more likely somebody send 0.1 BTC
and the rest of the input went to a new fresh change address.

That Bitcoin will be worth 100K before the end of  the year. Which would be great, they might pay everybody some dividends.

Is bitfinex not centralised and shapeshift decentralised? If bitfinex gets hacked you loose all your coins. With shapeshift you just make trades directly with other users without shapeshift being able to steal your coins or to get hacked.

Roger has been doing stuff that makes Bitcoin a success in commerce, that's why he supported Segwit2X and now Bitcoin Cash. While guys like you do whatever they can to make sure Bitcoin becomes as successful as it can in speculation an as unsuccessful as it can in commerce.

Actually it was started as a sub about a Canadian TV show but became inactive and then around the same time as was created it was claimed by and became another sub to talk about [Then theymos asked 90% of the community]( to [leave and those that did not he banned and then they where forced to use to talk about bitcoin. 
This is not something the current people here even know and my post will probably get removed and I will get banned. Just for pointing out what really happened and why so many bitcoin supporters hang out at All because theymos said: **a blocksize higher than 1 MB, fuck it ... never going to happen. I won't even allow people tot talk about anything Bitcoin with a higher block size then 1 MB.  Bitcoin by my definition will forever have a 1 MB blocksize limit and I rule three central places. Now you can all fuck off.**
And so we went to and finally where able to have  a bitcoin with a block size higher then 1 MB. 
And the people here are stuck with believing whatever the truth is for that day, it changes all the time. Right now they want you to be mad at bitcoin.com and sue them. Tomorrow they want you to be mad at store A for accepting bcash and the day after they want you to be mad at person B saying whatever he said. 
Have fun and don't ask your leaders any questions, you might end up with a ban and then you are forced to use alt coin subs or worse, use because it's the most active place for bitcoin discussion. Bitcoin with a blocksize higher then 1 MB that is. But I guess here that can never be bitcoin ever. Because theymos said so and he is the ruler that all bitcoin users have voted on ... on no wait that's not how it happened. He is a central authority making life for anybody that loves bitcoin very very hard. That's the truth and so ...this is going to disappear.

They where processing about a 120 shops. These are the combined stats for all of them. On the left side are the amount of orders place at all the shops and on the right side the combined amount of those orders.
I think the project is over now. Bitkassa used to pay the tx fee cost themselves, when the fees with Bitcoin-BTC went really high they stopped the project and now customers themselves have to pay the tx fee and now the project has ended.

Why? It's a fork of Bitcoin supported by a big enough part of the community for it to be a viable fork. We have as much right to call ourselves Bitcoin as you guys.

Here are [some stats]( from a payment processor called BitKassa who have convinced a bunch of stores in Arhnem (The Netherlands)  to accept Bitcoin.  Let's see if I can find the more recent stats.

I could continue but you can read for yourself can you not?  It's not a minority at all.  Active people on are about half of active people on and people active in ethereum and other alternatives, then is the minority. 
And let's not forget that ethereum was going to be build on top of Bitcoin but because of the hostility of the devs that did not happen. 
Keep trying to rewrite history. It won't work, we will put it in the blockchain and you will never be able to rewrite it. 
This sub is obsessed with BCH, why is that? It was a minority back that, a minority of people with central power that pushed the majority away and it's a minority of people with central people now that make this sub obsess about BCH and suing bitcoin.com and basically making sure that bitcoin stays relevant by always having "enemies" to fight.
Eventually every dictatorship comes to a end. Everything surrounding is centralized around theymos and Bitcoin-BTC has completely be hijckaced by a small group. Once they give up and accept defeat, this place will turn in to a ghost town of trolls and shills and bots.
