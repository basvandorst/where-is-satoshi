I understand. Yeah and when it rockets, you won't need bank account and your landlord would be begging for a piece of Btc.
Having said that andlords days are still far to accept Bitcoin in India.  
Get multiple bank accounts. Get one scarified or try IMPS through platforms like Wazirx without mentioning names like crypto or Btc in comments.

Interesting, how?

I am anticipating even higher by 2024. Easily above 7 trillion.

Turn it into a blog or stats curating platform. Would be happy to discuss possibilities.

Not before it is too late to cut this in the nip.

From current behaviours and level of understanding they think it is too small to harm them. But I think they will wake up after the next halving when Bitcoin brushes at least half of the marketcap of Gold.
Overall enjoying this ignorance and also realizing that we have a very brief window of adoption.

your mum is smart.
 IMO sacrificing your bank account for some BTC is worth a bet because as per your described situation, your mum's money isn't safe in the bank anyways. As they can simply say, we don't have your money, sorry.....

Bitcoin doesn't care about your age &amp; neither understands it...

Agree! some are scared they will need to give up their bitcoins in the next divorce &amp; some bluff about owning it because that would look un-cool....hahaha
But irrespective of that only 40-50 millions around the globe know about Bitcoin which is miniscule.
