Because there are leaders, do you think bitcoin is sentient and makes decisions on the next updates on it's own? No, a community comes together and democratically comes to an agreement on what changes to adopt, if enough people don't agree on the proposed changed then not enough nodes will adopt said changes and said changes can't happen.

If you owned your house outright, didn't have to maintain a certain level of wardrobe for a 9-5, kept 100-200k cash reserves... you could easily satisfy 1/3 of your expenses off of dividends from investing the rest, making up the rest liquidating small bits of the worst performing things in your portfolio monthly... doing that you could get by 20-60 years easily in the U.S., abroad youc. If some of those early miners were near retirement age already... nevermind what they may have been squirreling away for their entire adult life.

You might be, I'm talking about dividends based on my current holdings increased to that million figure, for an easy example 100$ share generating a quarterly dividend of 20 cents, meaning 8k$ on that million. Based on what I currently hold I'm looking at 15 cents a quarter to 30 cents or so a quarter on any one thing, with per-share values ranging from 18$ or so to 300 or so a share. 
So somewhere between 8k and 13k or so in dividend a year on that million. Plus 7.3-7.4% increase annually in the actual value, which is some of what I'd be drawing on to make up the difference the dividends aren't.

They aren't going "hmmm bitcoin, lets see how we can tax it as much as possible". I personally LIKE how they are treating bitcoin... yes, miners should be taxed at time of creation... they are creating something from nothing essentially (from electricty and time). For those just holding bitcoin, if it goes up considerably in value they need to be paying capital gains tax because they did in fact realize a profit. 
Maybe in 100 years and change when all (almost) 21 million bitcoin are created and the price is stable (if it even lasts that long) then it should probably receive tax treatment as a currency. Until then, especially in the near future, it's an investment if you buy it with fiat... it's not stable, it's not accepted by the masses, it's a speculation.

Yet it happens all the time, that's why there are a dozen different forms for reporting people and a cash reward system in place. 


I know very few people that consume marijuana, very few that even condone such behavior. In a white collar world people pay attention to their peers spending habbits. The people that are constantly talking about evading taxes on their bitcoin on this sub aren't talking about hiding a couple of hundred of bucks a month, they are mostly talking about hiding capital gains in tens of thousands or higher. If they intend on spending that bitcoin it WILL be noticed by those around them, there will be a disparity that pops up on their peers' RADAR. People get hefty fines for fudging their taxes and prison time REGULARLY, as I said previously a significant portion of the time it's because someone reported them.

Believe me, if my personal and business accounts were closed and I thought it was bitcoin related I'd have a blog post about it, I'd contact a few lawyers, I'd be shopping around to local and national level investigative reporters and I wouldn't be hiding behind a random webhandle on a 12 hour old reddit account.
If so many people were certain it was bitcoin related, there would be a class action website already from 1 or more lawyers asking for anyone that believes their chase accounts (or paypal) were closed due to bitcoin related transactions.

I've damn fine credit, I have none of the benefits you have. My best card gives me a whopping 1% back and that's actually my business card. I think you are unaware of the sorts of people you are talking to, there are people on here that probably make your financial situation look like a joke.
As far as fees to convert to fiat currency, what 1% plus 15 cents per exchange? Shhhhiiiitttt you know what I have to pay for currency conversion on foreign purchases, 3% and that's fairly standard. 
And as far as your card offering fraud protection, sure it does... and guess who pays for that fraud... business owners, when someone buys something from me fraudulently... guess who's left to eat the cost. Me, the business owner and guess what I have to do... I have to raise prices to recover that loss and that gets passed right back to you or to takenkokoko jr. 
Also, ever read the terms you agreed to when you signed up for that card. You should, you really should. You have no rights, the issuer has every right. They can do what they want, when they want to you. They own the card, you do not. They have the right to hit you with any number of penalties or fees, they can close your card at any time for no reason... so you are enjoying a nice vacation abroad, relaxing in your hotel room *knock knock* and then before you answer the door opens, enter hotel staff "yes, Mr. Takenokoko your card has been declined, we will need payment now"
Just because your card has fraud protection, doesn't mean you are protected... it just means if you can prove to the issuer of the card you didn't make the purchase they MIGHT not make you pay for it... sometimes that's fairly easy, sometimes it isn't... I had a car number somehow get used, had to have been a skimmer it never physically left my possession once, to buy about 7k$ worth of airline tickets all over Asia and Africa... credit card company called ME saying they believe they'd detected fraud... guess what... I still had to prove to them I didn't buy said tickets and it was 3 months until they removed the charges from my statements. I didn't have to pay on those charges but they sat there on my statement for 3 full months keeping my card's balance almost full (which was being reported to all 3 major CRB's and the utilization droped me several dozen points on FICO [not FAKO])... 
Credit cards aren't all that great... personal cards are absolutely un-necessary... they allow one to extend beyond their means by making purchased they don't have the funds for. For my business, my card is used weekly... when stock levels get low of something I can re-order without cash-in-hand (which I have to, because the damn merchant takes 3 business days AFTER the charges are settled each day, at 6pm EST... when most of my orders between 8pm and 4am) for them to actually deposit into my business checking account. Bitcoin, I can spend usually within 10 minutes, and I've never had bitcoins take longer than a half hour to be fully available and that was quite some time ago when Bitcoin was still rather new.

I'll call that a marketing win!) and now that I've been accepting bitcoin a week over at Genco Peptides (I have even had my first order with bitcoin exactly 1 week after accepting it) I decided to make another card to include in every order that will help raise awareness for bitcoin!

I've been using email since 1994, it wasn't until the late 90's that a fair number of people even had email accounts, it wasn't until the mid 2k's until it was a commonly used tool.

On earth perhaps. A lot of astronomers, and entrepreneurs, are fairly certain the asteroid belt contains far more precious metals than earth (as well as rare-earths, base metals etc). So while as far as we are concerned now it is however you might see precious metals being mined in space in the relatively near future (20-100 years) and while it would be cost prohibitive to bring it down to earth (sans space elevator) it would most certainly be used off-world for construction/manufacture of goods.

Reality. They have chip factories, they have chip materials, they have chip designers, they have government and corporate corruption, they have energy. They now about face on their decision on banks dealing with bitcoin...
They'd be damned fools to NOT start developing tons of ASICS. I guarantee you someone is sitting in at least one factory thinking... if I break this group of employees off to work on a bitcoin ASIC... then fudge it into development costs for clients a b and c and the fabrication costs into manufacturing costs of clients x y and z I can start generating absurd amounts of bitcoin for myself. They can develop their own mining rigs and power them and bill it all to another company by hiding it in development and production costs for something unrelated.

Why, so he can make the money disappear?
Guy allegedly robs a liquor store. Guy is taken into custody an hour later with the same amount of cash missing from the register. Cash is kept from guy pending trial. 
**Same. Fucking. Thing. Here.** guy has money, that more likely than not couldn't be reasonably explained on paper, is being tried for selling stolen goods and laundering those profits. Court has a valid reason to suspect the funds he set aside are possibly ill-gotten, from the alleged crimes. Court has money frozen pending trial. 
If they don't freeze the assets, assume the guy knows he's guilty and is out on bail. Guy's lawyer says "well, it's not looking great, we are losing and you'll probably lose next week... a few weeks later you'll actually be sentenced" guy goes "well fuck, if I can't have the money, I'm going to make sure they can't either" and starts converting it to cash and giving it away on the street corner... or decides to go drop 100k at a strip club or casino. 
The guy isn't fighting a DUI. The court didn't go "Well Mr. Smith, you were driving under the influence, we are going to freeze your money" they said "Well Mr. Dumbshit, you just told us you took and sold the goods, you've submit nothing to show you earned the bulk of the money from a vocation or business not a part of the investigation so we've determined, pending the outcome of the trial, to freeze your assets for the time being".

They are all doing high risk transactions, and in some cases likely violating their account terms (international transfers after having said no they don't plan to do any international transfers when they opened the accounts).
 3 day old account
 added an international wire transfer payee. Chase requires you to go to them in person for international transfers, in fact (at least with business accounts) when you open them "will you be doing ANY international transfers with this count" "will you be receieving money from ANY international sources with this account" because it's additional paperwork to meet anti-money laundering requirements
 absolutely no evidence bitcoin related, very vague, also happens to be a web hosting service (apparently) and could have been shut down for ANYTHING (like several people using stolen credit cards for web services and being deemed a high risk customer).
 was receiving chase quick pays from random people, and it appears from several random people. This has nothing to do with bitcoin and is red flag for criminal activity.
 transferred 25k$ electronically over 3 months in irregular amounts, red flag for potential criminal activity
 doing 200k$ of transactions in 6 months from various sources (several of the transactions were likely considerable amounts of money and coming from individuals)  AND applied for a merchant account to process credit cards via chase which means an underwriter goes over the applicant's business site and financials looking for risk.
 the chase rep they 'quote' appers to speak horribly broken english. They added international wire transfer payee. Chase requires you to go to them in person for international transfers, in fact (at least with business accounts) when you open them "will you be doing ANY international transfers with this count" "will you be receieving money from ANY international sources with this account" because it's additional paperwork to meet anti-money laundering requirements user's reddit account less than 2 months old at time of post.
 "buyahash" and selling time on a machine, to an underwriter likely looks like "hmm that's a word for a drug, and they aren't selling a physical good, this could be a way to sell drugs online while masquerading as renting processing time" the underwriter could also think "not selling a physical good, not selling a digital good, accepting money in exchange for 'hashes' which may or may not generate 'bitcoin' sounds an awful lot like gambling, high risk". They also had large fiat purchases from random individuals, this poses a high risk for chargebacks. OP's company was likely relatively new, when they opened the account (it was probably a small business account which has fairly modest monthly limits and requires special paperwork to accept or send funds to international sources) probably said their average transaciton would be xxx and the monthly y,yyy and they were probably doing zz,zzz-zzz,zzz monhtly.

A lot of China's wealthy are cash poor right now and selling their insanely expensive houses in Hong Kong and Macau and what not, if they leaned on their politboro connections they get regulation of bitcoin and can start mining and converting it to various fiat currencies to rebuild their cash reserves.

By 45 I could retire if I wanted although I'd probably keep on at my current job till 50 or so because it's honestly not that bad and in 8 months I'll be up to having 25 paid days off a year heh.

Because it took them 13 hours and change to reply and send my bitcoins. They did not contact users before hand and say that transfers would not be taking place, in the past they would transfer the bitcoin within 1 hour of my customer sending them the bitcoin. 
That's unacceptable. What do you want me to think? They have a history of similar incidents on bitcointalk.org where people didn't receive their bitcoin for WEEKS after, they have a history of ignoring tickets for multiple people when issues arise, they have a history of losing a considerable amount of bitcoin to hackers in the past.
The simple fact that they did not communicate in advance to their customers that they would NOT be processing bitcoin settlement to customers for an undisclosed amount of time merits "Beware of" especially when it took them 13 hours to answer the ticket informing me. It's just bad business practice,  if they can't be bothered to mass mail their customers they won't be sending bitcoin along, what other corners are they cutting?
I said beware and advised the community to temporarily disable bips on their carts if they were using it before more people had bitcoin being held up with no explination in the event they were making off with the bitcoin losses would be minimized to the community.

Does it include the costs of mining the raw materials? I'm not opening a pdf. I bet they also did their figures using some insanely idealistic amount of solar energy hitting them and not real world figures. Clouds happen, storms happen, seasons happen, panels lose efficiency as they age. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for renewable energy but PV cells just aren't where they need to be yet to be worth it. Some in labs are starting to show good promise, in 5-15 years we will probably have something cool. In fact, we might actually see some cool organic hybrid PV panel in the near future thanks to developments like this  or via algae strains creating combustible liquid fuels (there are tons of companies tinkering with various algae for this). 
The only benefit to current PV panels is you are basically buying 10-30 years of electricity at a set cost, so as prices go up you save.

Voltaility IS a real argument right now. Thursday I watched it drop 10%.

Upped this, it's quite possible. As more countries start to have positive legislation or at least say "nah we aren't going to regulate" more and more people will be moving fiat into bitcoin. More and more businesses too. Even if all (almost) 21 million bitcoin existed... that's only 105 billion USD in fiat currency that would have to go into to get it in the 4000-5000 USD range. 
Well the 21 million won't be around for a while, as of making this post a little over 12.1 million bitcoin exist... so just for easy lets assume 15 million bitcoin in 2 years ( I don't know what it will be, since it slows down) that would be about 75bn USD value at 5k USD per bitcoin. Very very doable in 2 years if adoption rates continue to increase. 
For some frame of reference, the U.S. National Debt has continued to increase an average of $2.76 billion per day since September 30, 2012... fiscal year 2013 Overstock.com did 1.3bn in sales via cash. Apple did 170bn in revenue in fiscal year 2013. 
Basically, get enough consumers and companies dealing with bitcoin in the next two years and it's quite possible to see 5k USD per 1btc (I wouldn't hold my breath though in the next 2 years my wild-out-my-ass-guess is 1250-1500 STABLE). Also take into consideration this week a few investment groups have announced they'll be putting investor money into bitcoin via wall street (think hedge funds)... hedge funds currently manage some 2 TRILLION dollars... 1% of that would be 20bn, imagine if they moved 20bn into bitcoin... that would put prices up around 1400 or higher. 
Purely speculation: with these announcements of them investing as early as Q4 this year... it's possible someone is intentionally driving down price right now so they can snatch it up as cheap as possible with their private funds so that when they dump a bunch client money into bitcoin they can sell theirs and double or triple their investment easily... after-all it wouldn't be insider trading, bitcoin isn't regulated!

Not really... the credit card fee would be 2-3% of the transaction, if you are talking 1-2$ you are talking 5-6 cents.

Walmart, costco and others are not small businesses. They do millions and millions of transactions. They get far far far better merchant rates for processing credit cards. Once you reach a certain level of transactions you STOP paying a % and start paying a flat fee monthly, quarterly or annually per location. They are also buying by the train load (not rail car, multiple rail cars) of any given product which gives them considerably lower cost of goods sold figures.

They'd have to add more legal staff to keep up on all the domestic regulations involving cryptocurrencies as they'd be the governments  target for going after if something wasn't handled 100% right, etc.
If bitcoin lasts, Google will eventually integrate it... I do NOT see that happening until it's more stable AND more people are using it.

As a guy that left an OGA because of the crooked shit he saw going on directly related to Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom... I still stand by what I said. While oil and profit might motivate some things we do on large scales (OEF, OIF) various SF groups go into countries all over the world that you don't hear about on the nightly news. The Army is regularly in multiple countries in Africa helping deal with oppressive war lords and dictators, as well as in Asia and Eastern Europe. 
When the Japanese bombed pearl harbor, the U.S. could have gone to war solely with Japan and defeated them in quick order... what did we do though, we saw all the horrible shit that was going down thanks to a bunch of goose-stepping backwards idiots from Germany and we ran to the defense of every country in Europe that was being threatened/already under-siege by Germany. Sure, we tossed a fair bit of troops at Japan but for the most part we were concerned more with eliminating the threat that was Adolf Hitler and his top echelon. Had we not Western Europe would be goose stepping around speaking German with millions and millions more having been exterminated in death camps. 
We've been in Bosnia and Croatia for DECADES now doing our best to keep genocide from flaring back up on a massive scale.
Yemen, Lebanon, South Korea, Libya, Somalia, DR Congo, South Africa, Brazil, Peru, Columbia, Bolivia, Mexico, Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, Kenya, Sudan, Chad, Nigeria... all countries U.S. military have a continued presence in... with the exception of a few, from explicit invitation from the host governments... 
Guess who is the first country everyone calls when a warlord pops up, or a natural disaster devastates? That's right, the United States. Guess who's the first country to rush troops and supplies to an area when that call comes in, that's right the United States. Guess who's the first to respond to requests for training for troops by host governments, that's right the U.S. 
Touching specifically on Iraq and Afghanistan, I say YOU should stop watching television... send troops into a U.S. village that's not currently under threat by groups like the Taliban and ISIS and people pour out into the streets to greet American forces, they queue up at the SF medics happily because in many cases it's the first time any of them have had the ability to see any medical professionals. The girls and women get excited and happy when you tell them you are going to build schools and they don't have to worry about some creepy old lecherous fuck bedding them as a child bride. Kids rush up and want to hang out and check you out and see if they can trade anything for you. Hell, go to any of the countries I mentioned that we are in and if you throw an empty water bottle on the ground, that fucker is gone within a minute because it's a valuable container to store water in and is going to be kept and used until it falls apart. 
Please, tell me though how I should spend time on critical thinking. Please, tell me the U.S. should mind it's own business while people are being used and abused and deprived of their basic rights. Please, tell me how villainous I am for being an American.

Yes, and google is also a for-profit company. 
how many people shop with their bank account? A lot more people use debit/credit card, which means a fee... Google knows this, it's a way for them to make a profit and it's competitive with paypal. 
Also I suspect those that use their bank accounts, likely don't transfer for every purchase but keep a balance in their wallet, which google probably keeps a fair percentage of out of the system and in an interest bearing business savings/checkings account... which is another way to generate income.
For BTC they can't charge the credit card fee, no one will stand for it, and there aren't bitcoin interest bearing savings/checking accounts.
Google BUYS companies and technologies they can make a profit from. Bitcoin they'd have to accept much smaller profits than they currently do from credit/debit/ach via google wallet. They also can't control bitcoin, hell they arguably can't even influence changes to bitcoin... Google likes to OWN things, with the credit/debit/ach they have a strong influence over their bank/merchant "hey, we've got all these millionsof users in this country, millions in that country, give us a good deal or we walk". They can't do that with bitcoin, bitcoin is decided by the community.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:29:55

No. Generating bitcoin is not money laundering. Selling it to an exchange in a huge amount will raise some flags
Buying bitcoin from an exchange, selling them to an exchange at a profit is speculation and you'll have records to show when you bought it and when you sold it.
Buying 10k$ in bitcoin from John Smith at Starbucks... is going to be seen as money laundering (and honestly would raise a red flag in my eyes too). Buying 50$ worth of bitcoin from John Smith at Starbucks wouldn't raise any flags with me.

Oh look the very first one... doing a half million dollars in deposits (probably from international exchanges) from buying and selling 'gold and silver'. 
Yeah that sounds like money laundering, that's high risk. They would have done exactly the same to a company that didn't accept bitcoin. "Well you have all this money, a rather large sum in fact, being wired to your account from these exchanges in Europe and Asia and you claim to be selling bullion with no paper trail to back it up" "no I accept bitcoin" "yes but all we see is you getting a ton of money from international wire transfer and no sales records involving e-check, credit or debt card transactions".

Solar industry includes more than PV panels, like concentrated solar power.  if PV panels were so efficient you wouldn't see them building 10-15 GW worth of concentrated solar power plants the past few years.
The main reason PV panels are increasing in use is because:
1. you can drop them anywhere 
2. lots of countries offer corporations (and home owners) tax credits for building them (that's why you see campuses like google blanketing the parking lot with them, yeah they'll tell you it's to offset some of their energy costs and to shade employee cars... all they care about is the tax credit and locking in a set price on energy).
3. people don't get pissed when you drop a PV farm outside of their town but they fight tooth and nail to keep any fossil fuel, nuclear power, wind or hydroelectric away from their communities
4. people can slap a few panels up on their roof. 
5. 9 years ago they were still very costly, manufacturing costs are coming down, energy costs to create them are not. Yes, they are getting more efficient every few months, in fact there were some great developments last year, but PV panels are likely still a decade away from being worth a damn... on earth anyway, in orbit they are much better as a solution but still only convert a fraction of the energy hitting them.

Exactly, you'll probably have trouble getting through foreign customs because of that (I clear international freight for a living into the U.S., most countries are fairly similar), any country that has anything similar to the FDA is likely going to have issue shipping to without going through the proper steps to get whatever you need to import food there, here in the U.S. if someone mails you food from abroad that's commercially made it needs FDA clearance before clearing customs, even if it's home made (however homemade under a certain value doesn't require anything other than stating it's homemade on the invoice along with estimated value).

And as far as I can tell, the defendant has no evidence to show he obtained the devices by any legal means.
Did he buy them at an auction? Where's the receipt. Did he buy them at goodwill? Where's the receipt. Did he buy them from a company? Where's the receipt?
Lost the receipt? Where's the credit card statement or line on his bank statement showing the purchase.
He sold medical equipment (admitted to it even), it's safe to assume he's submit nothing that shows he purchased or otherwise legally obtained the items. He then sold the items (admitted to it even) and apparently has insufficient evidence to show he reported the income properly, paid taxes and then paid himself the remainder. 
I also see nothing that states no one is claiming ownership of the equipment... so there is likely a company, or companies, alleging the theft of the goods. The court was well within their right to temporarily freeze his assets pending trial. Especially if the defendant has produced no evidence to show he got the money from a vocation or business unrelated to the alleged stolen goods, had he been able to they wouldn't have frozen what he could document.

you are probably between $12,951 and $127,550 annualy. So you are paying 15-25% federal tax on it. Since you are doing 97 cents a day and that will continue to decline unless you add more hardware that is 360.84 or less a year meaning no self-employment tax, if you exceed 400$ from self-employment then yes you will need to pay self-employment tax at 15.3% up to $106,800 then anything beyond that will only have to pay 2.9% for medicare on anything exceeding that $106,800. So you are looking at paying 15-25% of that income to tax, unless you add more hardware then most likely 30.3%-40.3% plus any applicable state or county taxes AFTER deductions. 
YES you can deduct the square footage of your mining operation, the % of electricity they are drawing (easy to do since you should know the watts per manufacture's specifications) and even a portion of your internet bill. You do NOT need to be an LLC to have a small business or a Co or INC they just offer various types of legal protectoin &amp; additional functions... meaning you'll probably be paying 15-20 cents on the dollar.

I'm not a fascist, the dude admitted he took the goods and profited from them. He then admitted his guilt in advance by setting money aside for an anticipated legal battle. His funds were also FROZEN, not SEIZED. The court is well within their right to have frozen his assets, especially since he admitted he made money selling the goods in question. 
Courts don't freeze your assets without just cause, because if you prove your innocence you can easily come back and sue the state/federal government depending on what court it is for damages/losses experienced while your assets were frozen.
This dumb ass told them he sold the goods, he then told them he anticipated legal trouble and set money aside for legal defense. There is reasonable evidence he was participating in money-laundering as well, courts just don't freeze assets without just cause. They freeze asets when there is a good reason to believe you might try and make a large amount of money, that you gained through alleged criminal acts, dissapear. His money, is essentially EVIDENCE. It's potentially evidence of profiting from the sale of stolen goods and potentially evidence to money laundering. **when someone is accused of murder, and taken into custody with the alleged murder weapon, do they say "oh hey you can go ahead and take that knife/gun home with you, but make sure you don't get rid of it because we will need you to bring it to your trial so we can use it as evidence" no, they take the item and check it in as evidence. By freezing his assets they are essentially making it so he can't tamper with evidence, in this case money he partially, or entirely, made from the sale of stolen goods and then laundered.*

I agree completely, you also have to factor in things like the working population increasing in number, resources costing more and more due to supply and demand (natural resources, food, energy), hell for that matter little green men could come in spaceships and invite us to join an interstellar trade system where maple syrup is priceless and bitcoin becomes our global currency for interacting with the interstellar trade (ok I may have just borrowed the bulk of the interstellar trade, including the maple syrup, from author John Ringo and his Tory Rising series but haha). 
Sure, 1000x rise is probably not too likely in 2 years, but hey in 10 years, or even 20 it's not unthinkable. Right now, I'm purely treating bitcoin as an investment vehicle for wild speculation... my small business does however accept it as a payment (not a single bitcoin customer yet) though and I hope that it would eventually catch on (hopefully in the next few years) but for the time being I'm looking at it as a long-term investment vehicle (decades) not 2 years, and a risky one at that (just like I do with any stock related in any way to space exploration) I only put in what I can 100% afford to lose and don't sell at all... one of those companies might develop a faster than light drive in a few decades and make me filthy rich, and I might just be throwing money away like people do with lotteries and casinos... I treat bitcoin the same... I HOPE it takes off but until it does it's just one of my many high-risk investments.

I hate chargebacks, as a business owner myself when my company was in it's infancy one of my first few customers ordered about 600$ worth of product. As soon as it delivered they issued a chargeback saying it was fraud, money came right out of my business checking nearly crippling me... 43 days later after showing that I shipped to their bill to... turns out they were in fact valid to the card and that the guy was just trying to con free product out of me. 
Every single decent sized order I've had since makes me cringe and super paranoid worrying if it's another douche trying to rip me off. While I love that XBT doesn't allow for chargebacks as a business owner... as a consumer too I hate it, I've had to issue chargebacks on 2 different plumbers, an electrician and a general contractor in the past due to faulty workmanship or in one case not finishing the project. The eventually all got their money, AFTER they came out and fixed the issues... had I paid with XBT I'd have been SOL.

Asshats that think it's the next hot stock/commodity are the reason the price is so damn volatile. Volatility drives away John Q.

If he's innocent he should have no issue getting money from friends or family. Hell, if he is innocent and has evidence to support it beyond a resonable doubt I imagine there are a worthwhile number of attorneys that would defend him and take payment after the trial.
But he isn't innocent, he even admitted he took the goods and sold them and is trying to argue that since no one wanted the stuff it's not stealing. 


No, it should be ruined because he's a thief. He admitted that he took the goods and profited, he's arguing that it's not theft because no one was using the goods. He all but plead guilty, the court is well within their rights to seize his assets. He further admits guilt by borrowing against his real property and setting the money aside anticipating legal trouble.

"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
Bitcoins in Space One Step Closer
 
- BitSat Design Study Announced
 
 
 
ATLANTA, GA. – April 23, 2014 – Bitcoins took one small step towards space today with the announcement of a preliminary design contract between Jeff Garzik’s Dunvegan Space Systems and Deep Space Industries Inc. as part of a drive to develop an orbital system for the not-for-profit BitSat project. The BitSats will comprise an orbital node for the bitcoin network now on Earth with a constellation of tiny BitSats continuously broadcasting the latest bitcoin block from orbit, enhancing the resiliency of bitcoin in the event of disruptions or outages to the terrestrial bitcoin P2P mesh network. 
 
 
 
“Private spaceflight is breaking big, driving down costs so that great ideas like BitSats are within reach of even volunteer nonprofits,” said Garzik, who is organizing a donation-supported campaign to build and fly the system.  “We want to keep bitcoin healthy and free by finding alternative ways to distribute block chain data.”
 
 
 
Bitcoin transactions become official once a group of them are encoded – or “solved” by independent computing efforts -- into a block and added to the blockchain, a record of every bitcoin transfer ever made.  BitSats broadcasting the most recently solved blocks will provide a cross-check to verify that the blocks available on the terrestrial network haven’t been spoofed, as well as providing the latest blocks to locations off the terrestrial grid.
 
 
 
“Deep Space has always said we are about using space resources – this includes space itself,” said Rick Tumlinson, the company’s Chairman. “While this announcement may surprise some people, it is actually very much in line with our spacecraft development plans, including another private spacecraft system we will be announcing in a few months that will use many of the same components and systems. This means much lower costs - very important for the donation-based BitSat effort.”
 
 
 
BitSats may employ the CubeSat standard of individual cubes 10 cm (4 inches) on a side, with one to three such cubes potentially making up each BitSat.  They will be sent into orbit as hitchhikers on the launch of much larger satellites, lowering the cost of placing them in orbit.
 
 
 
“I believe space holds the promise of our future, and also offers a lot of utility right now,” said Garzik. “I chose DSI for this project based on depth of their proposal, the expertise they have internally and within their network and the fact that they are pushing the cutting edge – just as we are at Dunvegan.”
 
 
 
Deep Space Industries will develop detailed requirements for the space and ground segments of a BitSat constellation, and preliminary plans for the architecture, operations concept, and spacecraft design.  The resulting blueprint for next steps will be published in August for open community evaluation at   Dunvegan Space Systems is collecting donations  for the BitSat project via the bitcoin address 1M9MyyPsAak7zRjW4D96pTxDaAEpDDZLR7 processing through payment processor BitPay.
 
 
 
“The goal is to design a downlink system from the satellites to the public that is as open and inexpensive as possible,” said Daniel Faber, the chief operating officer for Deep Space.  “While most people will buy their downlink setups from a vendor, ideally a smart hobbyist should be able to download a design and build their own receiver from much less than $10,000.”
 
 
 
ABOUT DUNVEGAN SPACE SYSTEMS
 
Dunvegan Space Systems is an early stage spaceflight micro-company.  DSS operates the non-profit BitSat project.  A strong proponent of private spaceflight and open source, DSS believes the private spaceflight industry is best incentivized through small, cost effective, attainable missions based on open designs. The BitSat project fits within that larger vision. Dunvegan Space Systems is exploring technologies and business models whose goal is a solar system wired for networking, with data centers on Luna and Mars. These missions and business models are made possible through expanded competition and lower costs in the launch and spacecraft manufacturing industries. Through the design and eventual deployment of the BitSat constellation, Dunvegan Space seeks to demonstrate that a functional space-based network may be developed at low cost.
 
 
 
ABOUT DEEP SPACE INDUSTRIES:
 
Deep Space Industries is a space operations, exploration and resources company. With several billionaires and nations competing to reduce the cost of launching into orbit and announcing plans for facilities and voyages into the Solar System, Deep Space is moving into position to supply the materials and propellant needed to cut the cost of staying and operating beyond the Earth.  Deep Space is tapping “local” in-space resources such as near Earth asteroids, starting with a prospecting campaign to find the richest targets, and then developing cost-effective ways to process asteroid materials into products for the in-space markets. Steps now underway include developing space capabilities, a knowledge base and top level expertise in all aspects of space related to the discovery and production of space resources and enhancing low-cost space commerce, from spacecraft systems design, operations, astrodynamics, science and resource utilization as well as user and broad customer/community development.

The same is true in the U.S., it's easy. You get your phone like normal then just like with my cellular provider I can pay by e-check, credit, debit card or go to a physical location and pay cash... so you add bitcoin too. Problem solved. Very few people are going to opt to use it anyway, but for bitcoin to survive we need companies accepting it as an option so bitcoin can actually start to be used for day to day purchases and expenses. Right now it's a novelty you can use some places, not unlike gift cards with the exception that it's value is currently volatile.

As bitcoin becomes more and more widely accepted, I bet escrow services (likely branches of the big banks) appear and start offering such a service. I'd never use bitcoin for a big-ticket purchase without some sort of protection. I wouldn't even order supplies/goods for sell for my small business with bitcoin at this time because I've had instances (office max) where I put in a sizeable order and they shipped it via a local courier... local courier reported it as delivered and even had a signature (not in my handwriting, or anyone else in the building, and they spelled my last name horribly wrong in the signature) and office max refused to issue a refund saying they had proof of delivery, all that saved me there was being able to do a chargeback. 
But hey that's the great thing about bitcoin, it's still in it's infancy and we all get to be here as things develop. I doubt we see any escrow companies that most people would trust anytime soon but when bitcoin starts to take off I suspect the banks will try to get in on it pretty fast, as well as pre-existing escrow companies or even insurance companies.

'capturing' them is never going to work well. Microgravity, multiple angles of rotation etc. It's going to be a hell of a lot easier to melt them either by deploying lenses and collimators in solar orbit that use the sun to melt them (like in sci-fi author John Ringo's Troy Rising books) or via some advancement in laser technologies and just build nuclear powered lasers in orbit and sending them out (then build several more with materials you pull off asteroids, asteroids should have decent amount of atomics/radioacives too, biggest issue here is going to be the cooling of the lasers, but once you could pull materials from asteroids easily you woudln't have to worry as much about cost of materials).

I know for a fact you can't ship to Indiana. You may want to look into that. I'm sure it will ship to Indiana via your site but you can not mail alcohol to a private party here. Indiana bans out-of-state producers from shipping wine directly to consumers' homes, we are actually one of the 6 states where it's a felony for either wineries or retailers to ship in violation of the law. Hell, we can't even buy alcohol here on Sundays for carry out.
These are our silly state laws  the out of state producer one is not listed there, however it is Indiana law and you'll notice wine.woot, mangria, and many many wineries will not ship here It's also spelled out here  
Edit: interesting, appears it may have changed in the past few months  somewhat anyway "Currently in Indiana, consumers can purchase wine directly from in-state and out-of-state wineries, but to ensure proper age verification, consumers must visit the winery for an initial face-to-face transaction. A consumer can purchase no more than 24 cases a year from any single winery, and no winery can ship more than 3,000 cases into the state annually."
So you still might want to cease shipping here to Indiana, since I doubt people will be coming for a face to face visit.

Pretty much. It's going to be quite heavy and impossible to slow with any current parachute technology, would need some serious thrusters to slow if you went that route, if you let it impact water it's likely going to hit the seabed even in rather deep areas, you'd get some molten gold raining down (if not an actual fracture creating multiple missiles), if it hits ground it's going to do considerable damage to the surrounding area (the ocean/seabed impact would to, not to mention flashboil large amounts of seawater).
Basically you'd be making a massive golden bullet, in this case it would be a kinetic impact round.

Who said anything about that? It's not going to be worth your time to mine 1kg of gold and bring it back, you are going to be bringing back hundreds of thousands of tonnes of precious metals, rare earths, etc. It's going to need to be packaged to survive re-entry, it's going to need to be slowed down upon re-entry for either a splash down or powered landing...
To bring enough of something to the Earth via asteroids to seriously impact it's market, lets say gold, you'd need to bring a year's worth of Earth mined gold (2,700 tonnes in 2013) every few months. To get that much gold off an asteroid you'd probably also have insane amounts of nickel, iron, cobalt, various rare earths, platinum groups metals, etc. 
The rare earths and precious metals would be valuable on earth for manufacturing but you'd be talking about bringing hundreds of thousands of tonnes a year back to earth... Chelyabinsk meteor weighed about 10k tonnes. It broke apart upon re-entry and did some serious damage and left a huge debris field... well you can't let that happen with your mined materials, you'll have to build apollo-soyuz style capsules and have them splash down in the ocean or tundra style like the soviet-era Russians. This is going to be horribly expensive, even if you are making the capsules in orbit, you'll have to land a few a day all year long once you had decent mining capacity in the asteroid belt... never mind the fact you'll also have to build something to bring them in from asteroid orbit, slow them down at a low-gravity processing facility (say the moon) land them, refine them, lift them off the surface, send them to Earth, slow them back down, load them onto your landing platform, controlled descent.
Sans a space elevator that can move some serious tonnage daily, asteroid mining wouldn't effect value of resources on Earth. Instead they'd be mined and use for orbital facilities around Earth/Moon/Mars/etc), facilities on the Moon, deliver massive amounts of materials to Mars (no one lives there, you could be a bit more sloppy with dumping material on the planet at first). Thinking that asteroid mining will effect Earth's economies as far as materials are concerned is just bad logic, if anything it would make skilled laborers considerably more costly to hire as a lot of them would be heading to space to build facilities in orbit and on other bodies. 
Just trust me on this one. I've spent hundreds of hours pondering and researching this. You've spent probably 5 minutes thinking about it.

90% probably covers their costs plus gives them some profit, the 10% is probably excess profit they can afford to gamble by holding (presumably until suppliers accept it or employees want it). 
As far as conversion 0.5% is what Joe Public gets, which is a lot better than 3-4% credit card fee. Overstock likely gets a much better %, it would be safe to assume they probably get a little better than .5% from exchanges since they are doing such large volume.

Indeed, you could actually set up a script to take say 10-15k wallets and just bounce the stuff all over the place, I mean when you are talking about 71 million dollars worth of bitcoin, you could just have them zipping here and there and everywhere into and out of and back to other wallets say amongst 10k wallets, then have them dump out to another 10k wallets or so and even sacrifice a million USD worth to every faucet you could find.
What I would do, if it were me, I'd bounce them all over amongst a few thousand wallets numerous times over a week or so, use some code to randomly sacrifice some here and there throughout the transactions until say 10% of them had been sacrificed to faucets/donation wallets/funding gaming accounts that won't be used etc, then I'd zip the remainder into another thousand or two cold storage wallets. 
Then I'd drive 8 hours or so from where I live, sell 5-10k worth via local face to face sales each weekend. Then I'd use some vacation time at work and zip over to the opposite side of the country hit some cities within an hour or two of it and do the same, come back to work... burn another week of vacation a month or two later. Then I'd sit on the rest. Occasionally move some of the wallets to new wallets until I'd gone through 50k wallets or so and by then I'd have started another business or three and be trickling coins into them.
After a year or two you'd have a lot more people accepting coins too and you could start using more for day to day purchases, your cup of coffee or dinner or what have you. You could also pay for flights out of the country cash for vacations and then splurge with the bitcoins in whatever country you take a vacation to and live well above your income's means while on vacation.

Actually I'm quite certain of it, a guy I did web work for couldn't pay me last year because all of his assets were seized for suspected money laundering from his business. It took his lawyer all of a month to show enough evidence that a large portion of his funds were earned prior to the formation of the business. The money they could document was made prior to the formation of the business was released, the funds in the business account and his real-property that had been seized were kept pending trial. Which made me quite happy because he went ahead and paid me from the pre-business money for stuff I did for the business which he totally didn't have to do.

For all we know, bitcoin was created by some organized crime syndicate for profit via nefarious things (like cryptolocker and the various malware that was mining bitcoin) and to move funds easier "It was highly unlikely this thing was ever to take off the way it did.

I'd give a ton away to a faucet, or even START a faucet. Pay for the hosting with bitcoin, buy the domain with bitcoin and create a faucet. Then I'd probably anon email some universities and high schools hitting up econ professors/teachers and say if they had students make wallets I'd fund them with some coins if the teachers built lessons around it. Bring a bunch of new blood into bitcoin and sacrificing a few million dollars worth would ultimately net you far more. 
Just think, that's about 70 million worth of coins in the original wallet. Give say twenty thousand people 500 USD worth of bitcoin and you'd generate a huge interest. If only 1% of those people stay interest in bitcoin after they spent what you gave away, you'd have 200 new fans out there spreading the word about bitcoin!

If you controlled 180k coins that are mysteriously owned... I could start selling today, a coin a day. If bitcoin stayed exactly the price it is while I write this post that would be $232,818.90 after 365 days of selling a coin a day. Dumping that much into the exchanges in say a 3 hour window would make a significant impact in price.
If they sold 5 coins a day.. 1825 total... using the same value as this very second that would be 1.16 million dollars they'd have to dump in a small window.

Yes, after tons of appeals and isolating housing units. The appeal process can drag a life-sentence out for DECADES, the inmates are generally segregated from the general population, are offered legal resources for their appeals, the appeals use up thousands of hours of manpower once they are all exhausted etc etc.
As far as costs for general population, the fee to cover the average cost of incarceration for Federal inmates in Fiscal Year 2011 was $28,893.40. The average annual cost to confine an inmate in a Community Corrections Center for Fiscal Year 2011 was $26,163. 
As far as costs for death row, The Times concluded that Californians and federal taxpayers have paid more than a quarter of a billion dollars for each of the state's 11 executions, and that it costs $90,000 more a year to house one inmate on death row, where each person has a private cell and extra guards, than in general prison population. 
Assessment of Costs by Judge Arthur Alarcon and Prof. Paula Mitchell (2011, updated 2012)
The authors concluded that the cost of the death penalty in California has totaled over $4 billion since 1978:
    $1.94 billion--Pre-Trial and Trial Costs
    $925 million--Automatic Appeals and State Habeas Corpus Petitions
    $775 million--Federal Habeas Corpus Appeals
    $1 billion--Costs of Incarceration
The pre-trial and trial costs is misleading, the bulk of that is the cost to the defendant, 1.7bn of that was the appeals process.
Immediate death penalty for those evading taxes on marijuana sales would be less than 100k per convicted person. Court costs, prosecution salaries, administering the killing agent. 
Therefore, SUCK IT.

It won't catch on if the media makes it look bad enough that constituents pressure their representatives to create legislation to make it unlawful to use. 
Marijuana became illegal because the cotton growers feared the hemp replacing cotton... they did so by making it look terrible in the media and actively encouraging (and funding) things like Reefer Madness  . It worked. With people buying weapons, drugs, kiddie porn etc via bitcoin and people constantly bringing it up (and supporting such darknets) on places like reddit, it only makes it easier for anti-bitcoin entities to stop it in it's tracks.

Not really. I want bitcoin to succeed, as a small business owner I see a lot of the concerns other businesses will have when accepting bitcoin.
As far as my business, it's niche... I sell to universities and labs frequently... I don't see the accounting departments of universities and laboratories using bitcoin anytime in the forseeable future... I just don't.  I accept bitcoin but I honestly do not think I'll ever receive a bitcoin transaction. If I do, I'll be over the moon because I'll instantly save almost 4% in transaction fees. 
I'm not defeatist, I'm just seeing it from a different perspective than you. Do you own a business? I have to worry about how to report the income for taxation, I have worry about cashing out bitcoin (the bulk of anyway) immediately after a transaction in the event someone dumps 20k of the Mt.Gox coins on the exchanges dropping the price so I get enough money to cover my costs and still make a profit. I also have to worry about keeping up to date on all legal happenings in my state, the buyers' states, at a national level pertaining to bitcoin or cryptocurrencies to make sure I'm not violating some law or not meeting some regulatory requirement. I have to worry about if bitcoin takes off amongst my customers if the IRS is going to come audit me after the exchange tells them "Hey, Ryan has been selling a lot of bitcoins via us" which, while I'd be fine in an audit, is a headache I'd rather not have.
You may see me as defeatist and unimaginative... I've put a lot of thought into how this will effect my current business and any other businesses I start. I put months of thought into it before I started accepting bitcoin last week. 
Hell, my business has become a target already, I used to have 1-2 orders a day that were never completed, usually by people outside of the U.S. and Canada that I can not ship to, they'd discover this at checkout after not having read the shipping page. This week alone I've had over 400 people try to check out with bitcoin with info like...
Name: aa
Street address: aa
City: aa
State: AK
Phone number: 5555555555
email address: aa
I suspect that's them trying to do crap like listed here -&gt; 
So, before you go saying I'm a defeatist, perhaps you should ask my situation, what thought I've put into this and the experiences I've already had.

I don't know what sort of assets the defendant had. However, medical devices are far from cheap, and if he was able to borrow 500k$ against his house... I can only imagine the cost of his house... probably in the millions. I'd imagine if he was selling medical devices that he even suspected were illegal to be selling (because he didn't pay for them) that he didn't exactly have a high paying job, and he clearly suspected he was guilty as he borrowed against the house in advance anticipating legal trouble... so I'm pretty sure it's safe to assume the bulk of his wealth was obtained from this alleged crime. 
And you people keep missing the fucking part where he's accused of money laundering. Meaning until forensic accountants can go through every single cent of cash he has, and every single cent he's spent on real property, everything he owns is technically evidence.

Yes, if you go to robocoins website it's to meet compliance. Anti-money laundering and the like because Robocoin ATM's sell and buy bitcoin.
"User activity is recorded and can be provably isolated to every transaction. Operators can set special limits for trusted users if they choose, revoke the ability to use the kiosk entirely, and analyze quantities and frequency at any time.  
Operators who enable KYC compliance use Robocoin's revolutionary 3 Step Verification to gain unprecedented KYC and AML intelligence. Each operator who has enabled KYC compliance creates a massively interconnected user network where a user who registered at a California kiosk can do business from a different kiosk operator in New York - and all operators can rest assured that Robocoin is ensuring legal use of all machines. User transaction activity applies to each operator’s compliance settings in this group to prevent nefarious buying behavior across operator boundaries. Operators who do not enable KYC compliance manage and operate their own segregated non-identified user network."

No clue, but they sent the letter out to every small business owner late last year or maybe early this year. My buddy in LA got one, I got one here in Indy, and several of his podcast listeners with small businesses also reported that they got them.
I guess it did say "cash activity" but they didn't define that, if they meant physical paper deposits/withdrawals or if that included paying bills/employees too.
"One report dubs Chase’s new rules “a war on cash and a war on small business and individuals” and says the new rules will lead to “a total cashless society that destroys all privacy and allows them to fine and fee the general population into serfdom.” Scary stuff.
The fear is that banks, and indirectly, the federal government have too much control over individuals’ money which sits in the form of deposits. Limiting withdrawals and keeping people from sending money overseas feels like capital control–a government attempt to prevent money from flowing out of the country. Think Iceland and Cyprus."

Bitcoin is a good idea, a global currency that's not controlled by any one 'bank' will likely be the currency of the future (assuming we don't nuke ourselves into oblivion)... but will it be bitcoin? Maybe, maybe not. Bitcoin has it's weaknesses, they may or may not be resolved adequately, but for bitcoin to hit a market cap of 1.2 trillion... a lot is going to need to change in the governments of several global powers as well as hundreds or thousands of multi-national global corporations.
Today is December 17, 1903, bitcoin is Wright Flyer I and it will be a long journey with many many changes, many many failures, many many successes, many changes before transcontinental commercial flights (in this case 1.2 trillion market cap and absolute acceptance of a cryptocurrency) become common place.

Yes, but I said dividends. Not interest from bonds. 
3% is less than inflation most years. Why earn 3%, when my current 10 year % on my investments is in the upper 7% range NOT INCLUDING DIVIDENDS. 
Take the dividends, low ball it, call it 8k$... then 7% of 1 million is 70k. So I take 22k from that 70k, plus the 8k in dividends and that equals a wee bit less than my gross from my job which I'd actually be paying less taxes on and wouldn't need to sell 22k of each year... 
So actually, looking at my increase from the past decade... I'd have my money growing 2-3% AFTER inflation and my living expenses, whereas with a 3% return on a bond... I'd be keeping pace (or doing wore than) inflation BEFORE my expenses.

It's pretty standard to assume 10 years is the effective life of flash memory for retaining data, unless you are buying drives with mystery-manufacturer flash in it, stick to drives with known flash in them and you won't have a problem, buy some off brand with crappy modules then yeah it's going to be junk and that's what you get. You do get electron leak but 10 years is widely assumed to be all that a flash drive is good for. So doing regular backups of your wallet you'll be fine.

Agreed. This is why, as a small business owner, like bitcoin. Both my merchant and paypal have their rather vague terms of service that they can cease my ability to accept payments.
Beyond that, Visa / Mastercard / American Express etc also can deny certain types of transations... the first that comes to mind is pornography involving bodily fluids other than reproductive fluids (haha not that I sell such stuff, it's just the one that comes to mind first). 
As far as American Express, there is actually a class action that I received a postcard about yesterday... something about suing so we (business owners) will be able to charge a surcharge or something to customers that wish to pay with American Express to help compensate for all their moronic fees. 
Such things are idiotic, if I'm not breaking any laws with what I sell or offer as a service then I should be able to take electronic payment for said products or services. This is why I love bitcoin and really really hope it becomes commonplace soon.

Indeed, my 1-year return is around 18% and my 5 year is around 11% (mind you I manage what's going into each fund and I log in every month to tweak things)... but dumping all your retirement savings into bitcoin isn't wise just from the simple fact of 'don't put your eggs all in one basket'.

Well this is similar in reverse, people see a bitcoin trading for 650USD and think "oh my, I can't afford that! How would I ever spend it, nothing costs that much!!!"

It's speculation, article or not. Fact is, you don't know why the bank made their choice.

Laws protecting and regulating them and you... the lawmakers draw salaries from tax payer funds, they use telephones (telco infrastructure is subsidized by taxpayer dollars), they use the internet which was largely developed via tax-payer funding, anything shipped to you comes either over the road or via planes both of which have been developed and regulated via tax payer money (you couldn't have safe air travel without the government oversight in the industry, over the road shipping requires roads and state &amp; federal laws regulate number of hours drivers can drive as well as the safety of the vehicles via DoT.... go to Mexico, they essentially have no safety laws for semis down there and they are dangerous eyesores).
A large portion of the goods on eBay and Amazon are not of U.S. origin, they enter the country through Customs are subject to inspection and laws from various OGA's such as DOT, FDA, EPA, F&amp;W etc. Did you know the FDA protects you when you buy a pair of sunglasses?

Well... lets see, my business just had it's second order via bitcoin. I gave the customer back HALF the savings I would have paid had they used a credit card. Order came in as I was sleeping so I actually lost 10$ while I slept because of fluctuation.
I then immediately turned around and spent nearly all of the BTC over at So I basically didn't stand to gain from bitcoin, the customer would have ordered via credit card like my other 500 something customers have. I didn't wait for the price to rebound to recover my 10$ or so and immediately spent more than 99% of the btc so from that &gt;1% I have left I doubt I make a huge amount on speculation...
That being said, I'd probably feel exactly the same as I do now. It's a medium of exchange, someone bought my product, I turned around and spent it as owner's pay so I didn't have to monkey around with moving money between the business checking and my personal checking.

This "we don't know who invented it" argument does hold.
Who is the creator(s)?
What was their motive?
What did they do behind the scenes before making it public?
What did they do before handing it over to the community?
Was it started by a hardware manufacturer that saw it as a good 3-5 year gamble to make huge profits off coins the mined shortly after distributing it in the wild?
Is there some currently unknown flaw that they hid well while developing it to cripple it at their will?
Was it in fact developed by a government that already had a system in place to easily track who is controlling what wallet?
Was it created by a kiddie didler? A terrorist group? A racist? If so I don't want anything to do with it regardless of it's usefulness.

MICROTRANSACTIONS. When you are paying a buck or two and have to pay 6-14 cents to the bitcoin network for the transaction... it's silly.

I didn't say it was created by organized crime, I said FOR ALL WE KNOW you jackass. Get over yourself. As far as 'You don't sound like someone who should invest in bitcoin anyhow' idiots like you are the reason bitcoin will never fucking catch on... BITCOIN IS NOT AN INVESTMENT

This is what I did, since I accept bitcoin for my online business I like to have access at my 'real' job so I bought a cheapo android phone from virgin mobile and do their 35$ a month prepaid which has 'unlimited' data. Gives me access to my wallets anywhere I am. Means carrying an extra phone but meh I needed a line for the business anyway, so I can turn it off... I get calls from other countries all night long "u ship country my plz thanx i buy!"

Yes, from your bank account... how many people shop with their bank account? A lot more people use debit/credit card, which means a fee... Google knows this, it's a way for them to make a profit and it's competitive with paypal. 
Also I suspect those that use their bank accounts, likely don't transfer for every purchase but keep a balance in their wallet, which google probably keeps a fair percentage of out of the system and in an interest bearing business savings/checkings account... which is another way to generate income.
For BTC they can't charge the credit card fee, no one will stand for it, and there aren't bitcoin interest bearing savings/checking accounts.

I've given to podcasts that I listen to that are on patreon.com and another I do a lot of purchasing on Amazon (several times a week) and always click through one of a handful of other podcasts I listen to's affiliate banners. I've also donated to some forums I'm on via paypal, so yeah I'd tip a site I like if I visit it regularly.
That being said, I probably wouldn't remove all your ads... look at which placements and networks perform best and leave the top 1 or 2, then remove the rest for the time being if you depend on them to cover your hosting... if you don't, go for it and let us know how well it works.

A rather large % of people that get audited do NOT get audited because of something on their tax returns or from a financial instutition notifying the IRS of something supsicious... they get audited because a co-worker, neighbor, family member, friend etc see them living above the apparent means of their job and notify the IRS which may or may not trigger an audit due to such information.
They have at leats EIGHT different forms for reporting someone for tax fraud/tax evasion.

No. You miss the point.
You get a bunch of tech journalists stopping by the booth shoving their phone in your face for audio or video and you just sitting there ignoring them or saying "no comment, no comment" gets spread around every website even remotely related to tech, goes viral and is a PR NIGHTMARE.
Cancelling sending people to a convention that primarily shows off **POSSIBLE** technology that more often than not never hits the shelves, not only avoids the PR nightmare but goes a little way towards saving funds (hotel, airfare, car rental, food for employees) and allows attention to be spent focussing on the current issue instead of going "hey guys we help people accept bitcoin, have a magnet, thanks for stopping by!"

True, but how much better could he be doing stepping into the 20th/21st centuries.

We get millions of people here for conventions and he's all on the sly like fight club ha!

yes it would, but people that knew anything about bitcoin... would. not. use. it. Because google would most certainly charge 1-2.9% of every transaction, like they do with credit cards now (I guarantee you they are only paying 0.5% or less for credit card transactions, so they are pocketing 2% or more of every google wallet transaction done via credit card)... it's just not realistic, their shareholders would have a fit.

I don't think it's a lot of BS... I had a few wallets over there under various logins (unused) and within a 12 hour window they were all accessed 3 times by someone else... the passwords were also one off's and all 15 character, symbols-numbers-letters-upper &amp; lower case. Once it happened the first time (all 3 accounts were hit within minutes of each other each time) I shot an email off to a friend saying "watch Mt.Gox is going to announce they were hacked" few days later they announced they'd lost all those coins.
I however do have my suspicions it was entirely an inside job. I mean, if you had access to that many millions of a mostly anonymous currency... make them all dissapear in an 'attack' then sit on them for 5-30 years slowly trickling them out for goods/services/fiat currencies, or pop up as an exchange a year or two from now run via a friend or someone you pay to run the company on paper and bam cash them out by selling them on your exchange for consistently 5-15% below market... one does have to wonder...

K, thanks for being an ass and projecting.
I never said shit about it being a solution. But bet your ass if Bitcoin gets segwit a lot of money is going to fly out of LTC relatively quickly and who wants to be standing around holding LTC watching the price full when it might be months or longer until you see it recover. 
I hold more LTC than BTC, probably more LTC than you.
