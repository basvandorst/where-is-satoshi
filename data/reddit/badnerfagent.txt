Curious. What states pay $600 a week in welfare? (assuming a 40 hour week)
Regardless. You keep saying that your system will be better than an already admittedly terrible one. You even state that it probably won't work well because of hicks in the south. So I don't really know what your arguing for at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:17:32
You keep saying shit, with no sources. Only your conjecture and I'm calling you out on it. You're full of shit, you can't even fathom the idea that wealthy people that don't want or need welfare are simply against it because they aren't getting some.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:14:14


Like I have proven with proponents own estimates, it will cost more. And this is not including the money that will have to be spent in setting up and maintaining the system. I am assuming 100% efficiency which is obviously not the case.


If you set such a low bar then you will be able to find efficiencies all over the place. If we were to do the current welfare system correctly, it should be much better than it currently is. However, just like with every socialist program, people will siphon off money everywhere. This will also happen to UBI.

I know plenty of people that would quit their jobs if they were given this money free. Hell, I know plenty of people that don't work because they get much less than that from welfare.
It won't work in any country in the long term. Just like children of rich people are much less capable than their parents, and the wealth in squandered by the third generation. People on the third generation of this form of welfare will live in a world where it may as well not exist.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:29:48
You keep making shit up. The average US welfare payment [is about $25]( a day on average. You said earlier that the UBI was $32 a day. You're once again full of shit.
And what's all this hate towards Southerners? It was a very uncalled for off topic rant. Especially since I'm far from the south and probably living in a WAY more liberal area than you are.#
And as for you calling me trash, this is just frustration with coming to terms with the fact that your UBI is not only a fantasy, but is worse off for the economy than even the current broke welfare system.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:42:59
I don't know the ins and outs of your countries welfare system. I'm sure I know more about yours than you do any other country that you're not native to.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:38:55
You'll need to create an agency to administer and handle the UBI. Here is where the siphoning and inefficiencies will happen. Also, lets not forget, that a lot of people (including me) will quit their job and play xbox all day.

but where's the fun in that?
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:31:06
But he's looking for advice on very immediate buying and then holding for a short period of time.
Had he said "I'd like to buy to hodl for the next 6-7 years or so" I probably wouldn't have made a response because it wouldn't matter so much.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:53:21
it depends on your timeline.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:56:08


I don't believe so. However, stating that you want to HODL for at least a year seems like a flawed trading strategy. Though I believe you will see a profit in this time, I don't think that's the optimal timeframe to book it. I think the best time for a medium/long term trader is to wait until the next ridiculous peak, this is likely going to be around at 2022 at least.
So if that means you can't invest 10-15% because of the extended timeframe, I suggest you invest less but plan to hold onto it for a bit longer.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:19:05
but he's talking about buying now.
and if he's selling in a year, it would definitely be optimal to buy at the low.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:26:24
Great advice. In all likelyhood, we will see stabilization before the start of a new breakout. Buying should be safe for the small investor at this point. The people buying now are the guys with a lot of money and don't want to push the price up too high with big moves. The small investor doesn't need to worry about this, so wait until it bottoms out and stabilizes.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:02:26
then I'd agree. It would be crazy to call the crypto market bear if you consider the last three months or so.
but if we're talking about now and the next few weeks, we're in a bear market and will see it bottom out and stabilize before we start to consistently rise.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:30:54
This is my favourite part.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:12:40
Imagine the agricultural revolution. There are no fields anymore that don't take advantage of the improvements we made during this time. This will have a bigger impact than the agricultural revolution, it is the financial revolution. The price speculations are simply based on recent historical trends, they could be wrong. What won't happen is that we go back to not rotating our crops and using an ox to pull the plow.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:27:19
That's way too high. It looks like there's a long correction that will go much lower than most people anticipate and last several months at least. I agree with prediction of 6k, though I don't expect it to stay there long.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:30:03
more like fiat
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:47:46
Even if what you say were true, that it's cheaper than the current welfare system, (not according to the recommended UBI of [$2,408]( multipled by population, 323.1 million, The UBI is bigger by over 62 billion).
It still doesn't take away from the fact that taking money from one group and giving it to another disincentives both and creates a government bureaucracy of people who's sole interest and motivation is to be less efficient therefore increasing the reward:work ratio.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:09
Ah yes, I remember reading something about this ages ago. I was getting them mixed up. Do you have a link so I confirm this is correct?
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:06:58
Well, what I would recommend is that you don't rush into it too quickly. We've entered a bear market and it's likely going to bottom out and stabilize before moving back up. So I would hold onto your fiat in the short term, analyze the graphs and when you see it bottom out and stabilize, then move into it. Good luck.

He offered me some bitcoins online. The weird thing is that I can easily get a chargeback on his account, and he will get totally fucked, especially talking this over with the fraud department.
I really don't want to be doing this, but I've given him 24 hours to show he's legit.

Thanks for taking your time to answer my questions. How long do the cash deposits typically take?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:46:04
Thanks. Yeah, most sellers over there want a verified ID. I have a dozen or so transactions over there with positive feedback (all me, selling). It's just that I don't have a passport. Would it be alright to keep your name here and PM you if/when I want to buy?

Why don't people just arbitrage it?

What I don't understand about these studies done of universal income, is that they only measure the quality of lives of people that receive the money. Of course life will get better for them. If it were serious, they should also be testing the quality of life it comes from.
Obviously in this case, it was charity so that's perfectly fine with me. But until they start measuring the quality of life it comes from through taxation, I will remain skeptical.

@_date: 2019-06-19 13:28:09
just read another article...The permission thing is what really gets me. That means there's basically a pre-mine where these companies can mine all the coins and then once it becomes inefficient to mine, they open it up to everyone else?
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:52:37
Whales have a lot more experience in the markets than new comers true and of course they're making profits, they bought in at very low afterall. However, to make out that it's a bitcoin rich vs bitcoin poor thing is incorrect. A bitcoin poor person can easily make money in these markets.
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:20:44
my first purchase was at $1,100 during Mt Gox calamities. It crashed three days later. I just kept buying all the way down to $350 (the slaying of the bear whale).[^[1]](
I've been tracking bitcoin closely since, I managed to get out at $20k then bought back right at $3k. I got out at $13,300 a few days ago. I still think it's going to go down substantially before I buy back in. Maybe I'm wrong, if I am then I'll just buy back at a new low of the next resistance. I keep making light of people buying at highs simply because it's no big deal, you will laugh about it in the future and regail to your grandchildren about how you bought at a stupidly low price and everyone thought you were crazy.
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:10:04
This is no way near a crash,
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:29:06
Because the bears out number the bulls.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:07:45
bitcoin has some way to drop yet.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:14:12
the bubble here was obvious though, I do believe in bitcoin over the next four years or so but this bubble had bitcoin out performing all other cryptos massively and there wasn't any real increase in volume.
I still think there's a way to go until we hit the bottom, I'm guessing around $8k.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:33:27
Sorry guys, it looks like we're still in for a bumpy ride. Fasten your seat belts.
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:45:38
I don't believe we will hit new lows (sub $3,000). However, I think it will be a lot lower than people are expecting/hoping. What keeps the price during those times are the people that bought at the high and are forced into holding to not realise a loss. This was me back in 2013 so I know what it's like. The key is to simply buy up the bottom, that's much more important than getting out at the high.


Being a whale has nothing to do with it. It's mostly about experience in these markets and the willingness to put your money where your mouth is. I got out at $13,300 and I'm not a whale but the signs were everywhere.

@_date: 2019-06-29 08:36:13
Volume is up when price drops, and down when it climbs, the resistance is much greater going up than it is down at least until $8k. We are in a bear market my friends.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:57:36
