I have the whole trail from the coin purchase to sending the coin to the wallet. Edit : proof of chain of custody from time of purchase.

Reduce your risk by purchasing smaller amounts over time. This is called dollar cost averaging, and it reduces risk. Also reduces potential rewards.... but risk reduction is good to do at a time where you feel the price is high.

It could be that the 'buy' option is  missing because the feature is not yet available. I did not know blockchain.info had any exchange service. It seems to be new that they have integrated exchange through partnerships... "'Buy Bitcoin' tab to set up an account with one of our integrated exchange partners.If the buy option is not available in your wallet when you log in, stay tuned. We're working with exchange partners all over the world and we'll be in your area soon" ... All that being saod, blockchain.info has been a very reliable service. Just do not lose your wallet password and keep your recovery info.

Thank you Andreas, and other early awesome bitcoin public speakers... The Bitcoin Group, Meghan - Bitcoin Not Bombs, Will Pangman. You guys really helped me understand the tech and culture of bitcoin. I had mild interest in 2011, and began following all you guys in 2013... Which eased my uncertainties, provided me with basic strategy to just be involved and minimize risk. Now i have a great group of mining friends in the PNW and the whole world is watching the beginning of this sea of monetary change. Your collective words have had a huge impact. Will be on patreon soon to contribute.

According to BitcoinNW.com - "At the bitcoin kiosk, you can buy and sell up to $6,000 per transaction per day, quickly and in a safe environment.  The price will also be displayed along with the fee of 5%, the lowest in Portland.  " 
Five percent fee each way is a bit much. If you put money in bitcoin one month, and take it out the next that's 10 percent in fees right? 
I guess a one way, withdraw will be five percent -- so with a 40 dollar withdrawal it would be better than a standard ATM fee of 2.50 (6.25 percent) But worse than a standard $2.50 ATM fee for a 60 dollar withdrawal (4.1 percent)

I do not neccisarily share the opinion of HitMePat. However, I believe this is what he was trying to convey --
"Robocoin as a corporation is buying bitcoin directly from people at 15 percent below market price via their ATM. 
Hence, the rip off the people who trade BTC for cash, and they rip off the people who trade cash for BTC by charging 15 percent above market price."

Most often, I see 2.50 but I have seen 3.00 ... I was only converting it to a percent so you can compare a standard ATM fee with the Bitcoin ATM fee. Due to the fact that the fee remains the same on an ATM no matter what amount you take out, it is a better deal when you take out more money. That is what I was demonstrating by converting the ATM fee to a percentage of the total withdraw.

Downvoted appropriately.

I recommend taking that coin offline if you want to save it.. Leaving it online is fine, if you are going to spend it relatively soon. However, online wallets are not secure for any long term storage. 
How do you take it offline? 
There are many options, from  to  to paper wallets... or setting something up yourself from scratch...

It is important to make sure that the exit node is not redirecting your traffic or otherwise acting maliciously. There are previous examples of bad actors, including governments running rogue tor nodes as exit points, which may redirect traffic or attempt to inject malware.

That's a low point. Its been hovering at .88 to .90 most of the day. Doge is getting a lot of price manipulation right now. Some whales have sold off. I'm tempted to buy, but its scary just how much doge gets put into circulation daily.

Anything is possible, but based on the description you received... It sounds like you may have some data corruption or secondary encryption mechanism.
Do you have any other copies of the wallet.dat?
Are there any differences between the copies? ( # of bytes) ? 
You could also try comparing hashes of other copies of the wallet.dat you have... If you have several backups. If you identify a difference in size / hash, you should try again with the different wallet.dat copy.

Which has a lower barrier to entry? Install an app and send your receive address receive money ( crypto ) 
Or provide personal details to a corporation via a website or app. Await approval / acceptance. If rejected, review reasons for rejection and then try again. Then either visit a physical location, or have someone send money to the bank via routing number or scanning a check.
I think the former is easier. Even if there is a weird code. It is easier than looking up bank routing numbers, and apps will copy / paste it for you.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:04:48
I also found an old backup with 12 word seed but the words are like... Not standard. The wallet app doesn't let me put in the first word, for example.. Which is 'back'.

a micro-bitcoin is sometimes referred to as a bit. So it may be 1,000 mBTC. In that case, it might be more like $1,300 rather than 13c?  I find all the random units that people use more confusing than .01 or .001 btc.
Edit : These addresses contain around .00100639 BTC, date of 8/31/19 ...  $10 a pop
