The crashing has been super slow and gradual, a traders wet dream.  Super predictable for the most part and nearly every day to every other day is a 400-800 euro difference easy.  With the way the market has been the last few months you wouldn't need any USD while trading to increase your BTC volume.

Mining with  a graphics card has been pretty irrelevant for most currencies for a long ass time now and card prices have always been high... Any productive miner stopped mining with those years ago unless they mine total shit coins.

Market has been pretty damn amazing and predictable the last few months. I have been trading every day and regularly selling all and rebuying every other day with easy profits.  Anyone complaining sucks at trading or are very short sighted and shouldn't be buying very much cyrpto to begin with.  It's a long-term investment and the ups and downs shouldn't really matter that much especially on a day to day or even month to month basis.  
I missed out on selling at 18-19k because I thought the market wouldn't crash until the end of December so I have been making up for it by trading all the damn time.  had in 30 BTC in one exchange and another 20 in another and I put in an extra 30 in between both.  Almost 3 months later I just unloaded all my profits and bought in big.  116 BTC in profit.  Feels good.  Anyone with more than a few BTC should be actively trading that shit if they have an inkling for trading.
