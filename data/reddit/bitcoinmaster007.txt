Explain it to who. 
No one knows how it works. The truth is bitcoin was created by a computer.

I’ve used those QR codes. This one seems to be flawed.

The screen itself should not say that it did not work. 
There is no room in the crypto space for a product to not work. Enough coins lost and money stolen.  Consumers should have better.

Why would he show a machine that doesn’t work?

Why is Bitcoin not in charge 
@_date: 2019-03-31 15:45:31
The Banks have abused the trust of the consumer on many levels. 
I for one will revel in the knowledge that they will become a business that will grovel on their knees for each and every customer.

I’m sure it’s great and serves a purpose. But, in reality the perception is, that it is another financial product rushes to market. 
An ATM must be flawless, would it be reasonable for Chase or Bank of America to produce or demonstrate an ATM that does not work. 
Money is different than other things. It must be administrated perfectly with no flaws or it is a failed product.

In my opinion the product is broken. What genius does a public demo with a machine that does not work.   It says it doesn’t work on the screen. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 15:05:24
Banks are a scam

I have alot involved and invested with Bitcoin. 
It’s sad to see where it is, especially with all the talk of adoption and future usage. 
It’s sequestered into the back of financial promise. 
Dropped by half it past value
A product that has caused financial hardship to many
Used by thugs to intimidate the populous through crypto scams
Just a **** poor product all around.

Just go to a Bitcoin ATM
Why overcomplicate it.

Nice to see the 10 million dollar coin doing so well right now.
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:23:15
No need to explain
@_date: 2019-10-26 22:00:02
Sorry was looking at something else
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:10:44
Why is it that we shouldn’t worry. 
Many of us have thousands of dollars sitting in a failed asset
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:36:44
Buy it now, Do not wait. 
Forget all of the other coins. Bitcoin is the one that matters.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:23:16
I had more hope for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:36:23
I could care less
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:56:36
I’m waiting
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:35:17
Been using them all the time. 
No issue.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:20:18
I have a lot of money in it. 
I know exactly how the pile of **** Bitcoin is doing.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:09:22
Bitcoin doesn’t seem to be increasing in value. Disappointing
