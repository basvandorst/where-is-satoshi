I'm banned from rbtc. Stopping visiting there turned out to be for the best. It's a terrible place filled with very dishonest people.

I'm banned from rbtc, so people definitely get banned. It's not the end of the world. I wasted too much time reading rbtc and then waiting 10 minutes to be able to reply to comments. I recommend avoiding rbtc to anyone wanting to improve their quality of life.

Yes, that was pretty funny.
To give a little context, this was in response to ydtm's insistence that when Satoshi said the block size limit *can* be raised, Satoshi intended that the block size limit *will* (or *should*) be raised. Maybe I could've given a less humorous analogy to show how ridiculous and dishonest ydtm is.

I pointed out earlier that some of the most vocal proponents of the XT hard fork came up with the idea of a "spinoff" coin.
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:15:12
That's funny. You're pretending not to understand what I've alleged. I've alleged that those of you from the spin-off thread are agitating for a switch to XT, knowing it is likely to fail to gain the 75% (or even a majority). Those of you from the spin-off thread will then release a bitcoin spin-off with bigger blocks, in the hopes of becoming wealthier by being early adopters, or just as an altcoin pump and dump. If that's the plan, obviously you do have a financial conflict of interest, as do the others.
Now, see, the way to deny that would be to say something like:
"I, [cypherdoc2|Peter R|DeathAndTaxes|Adrian-x], do not now and will not ever support a bitcoin spin-off in order to raise the block size limit or for any other reason."
A knowledgeable bitcoiner could even sign it with a bitcoin private key for an address associated with them, but maybe that's asking too much.
That's how a denial would look.
Maybe you should consider what a denial of your accusations against the core devs associated with BlockStream would look like. It might involve provable statements that those core devs have had concerns about raising the block size limit before BlockStream. It might also involve pointing out that some of what they're developing would require/be easier if the block size limit is raised.
In other words, it's already been denied. And yet you and many others continue repeating the lie.
So I suppose it will help my case if you guys deny my spin-off accusations. Because then I can do what you guys are doing. I could pretend like I didn't hear the denial and keep repeating the accusation. Maybe I could draw a representation of it on a paper towel and post it on reddit. That would be incredibly edgy.

"BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while *Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain* so it's easy for lots of users and **small devices**."

Science is. Who gets hired at universities isn't.

People should depend on their own judgment after looking at the evidence. Is there more evidence for my spin-off accusation or for the BlockStream accusations the rest of you are pushing?
Part of the evidence is the spin-offs thread I linked to. Look at it people. I just ran the numbers and here were the top 5 contributors to that thread:
Peter R (95 posts), smooth (56 posts), cypherdoc (46 posts), DeathAndTaxes (42 posts), Adrian-x (26 posts)
4 of these 5 have been actively promoting big blocks.
It shouldn't matter how old someone's account is, and privacy via pseudonymity is basic to bitcoin's design. Those of you who've read the white paper know that. Nevertheless:
"I have been part of bitcoin since at least 2013. I'm hiding behind a new username because some of you (like cypherdoc) are not only dishonest but criminally dangerous. stopthespinoff, July 1, 2015, reddit.com"
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:41:14
OK. So when you announce your support for the spin-off and I quote your extremely weak denial of "i don't have a lot of interest in the concept right now," you'll have plenty of wiggle room. Interests change over time.
I didn't realize you had such a problem with new accounts. I didn't notice you having a problem with the new account that posted a bad drawing spreading lies. Maybe your actual problem is not with an account's age. Search deeper and maybe you'll find out what's actually bothering you.
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:48:33
You realize you're posting on a thread started by a 6 hour old reddit account, right?
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:49:50
I'm curious why you didn't ask this of the person who started this thread.
I actually answered this in another comment, so you can look there. I'll say a bit more while I'm here.
If you've paid attention to these block size debates you'll notice certain people repeat the lie that BlockStream wants to "cripple" bitcoin as part of their business plan. (This whole thread is based on this claim.) The claim obviously isn't true and anyone who has been around for a while knows that many core devs have had concerns about raising the block limit for a long time, predating BlockStream.
Many of the people repeating the lie know it's a lie. One can only speculate on why they're repeating a lie so often. Maybe they have some grudge against those core devs. Maybe they have some other financial interest. Or maybe they're just people of low character. In any of these cases, why would I want those people to know who I am?
Why do you want them to know who I am?
I signed up to reddit. I made a claim. The support for that claim is a bitcointalk thread about spin-offs that was written by some of the most vocal proponents of raising the block limit. You would have to look at that evidence to decide if my allegations are really supported by that thread and the subsequent actions of the people I named. Who I am really doesn't matter. Unless you want to silence me. Then I suppose knowing who I am could be helpful.

People need to wake up. All this talk about the blockstream devs is a distraction from the real conflict.
Two of the biggest proponents of big blocks are PeterR and DeathAndTaxes. They came up with an idea last year for creating "spin-off" coins. 
They know it's very unlikely for XT to reach a mining majority, much less 75%. After rabble rousing for so long, some people will still want their big blocks. And PeterR and DeathAndTaxes will have their altcoin spin-off ready and waiting. At first most bitcoiners will be reluctant to switch, and they're hoping they can increase their holdings during that time. (In the spin-offs thread PeterR mentioned being able to buy 10,000 of the spin-off for 1 bitcoin.)
This is just a game to some people. Don't be manipulated.
Edit: Adrian X was part of that spin-offs thread too. Who knows how many big blockers are part of this plan.

I totally agree. And I'm not just saying that because I'm your sock puppet who didn't make the list. Because I'm not.

I'm sorry but your comment is tainted. We can no longer support your account.

I also had some fun there for a while. It's clear that some of us get onto some downvote bot's list. About a week ago I got banned though, so no more fun for me. :(

I wonder if the user who said this is secretly a Coinbase employee:


If so, I hope he gets a bonus.
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:24:31


Coinbase should save this endorsement for use in advertisements.
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:20:50
I'm sorry to hear that. It's almost certainly too late to complain. I can only confirm that for some accounts GoxBTC purchased via Bitcoin Builder were definitely part of the settlement balance.
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:21:30
I did read that ETH is mentioned far more often than BTC in that other place.
@_date: 2016-05-28 05:05:16
I think you're misunderstanding. seems to be saying he bought these 1000 or so "goxbtc" at a discount for real btc (probably on bitcoinbuilder). This means he may have actually paid, say, 200 btc for this balance at mtgox. If so, and if there's a payout of 20%, he'll break even. For now he's only "lost" the 200 (or whatever he paid for the goxbtc).
@_date: 2016-05-28 05:18:59


bitcoinbuilder was for trading between gox btc and real btc. It's how someone could have a 0BTC balance (and 0 fiat balance) on Gox when withdrawals stopped and a 1000BTC balance on Gox when bankruptcy was declared.
@_date: 2016-05-28 19:24:54


By "Goxbux" do you include "Goxbtc" purchased from other Gox account holders via, e.g., Bitcoin Builder? Those were definitely not removed from the totals. If someone told you otherwise, you have been misinformed.
