Pure speculation here, but maybe it is the fact that there's not very many electronic payment forms there, and it's undeniable that electronic payments and online banking is easier to use, that is the *reason* they are doing it.
Rather than having people investing in the old, proprietary, and expensive infrastructure of credit card processing equipment, it'd probably be cheaper and easier to have everyone transition into using bitcoin payments for things.
Sort of the way that many countries bypassed the infrastructure to build phone lines and just went straight to cell phones.

If you truly understood the asset you are buying you would have seen the activity since October as mania, completely unfounded, and unsustainable in the short term and would have taken profits as those of us who *do* understand did. 
If you hold onto a stock that skyrockets for no other reason other than hype, earnings stay the same, and nothing fundamentally has changed, you sell at the top and buy back when it corrects. 
Hence the “buy low sell high” strategy. Instead, in crypto, people confuse any decrease in price an opportunity to buy, even though it was no lower than it was a week ago. So you have a situation of at least buy high sell high, or buy higher sell low. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:50:13

Changes nothing. Nothing fundamental changed in bitcoin/ethereum between October and January to justify a sudden 4x price increase short of pure mania. And anyone who is older than 14 years old can tell you how manias end. Hence, there’s your context.

Uhhh, the realization that the past few months have been a bubble... 


That’s exactly how markets work. People perceive value, and after a distribution of people’s combined buying and selling forces, markets realize an asset’s value. The price skyrocketed for the sole reason that people perceived bitcoin’s value to be a vehicle to getting them rich. Now that’s no longer happening, we are seeing the exact opposite of that... people are seeing it as a vehicle to make them lose money and are selling as quickly as possible. 


Dude, take a look around. Literally 98% of the talk since October has been about price gains. They were comfortable with the idea of gains. Stick around a few months after it really “dies” and you’ll understand what people who are comfortable with bitcoin are like. This sub is a shell of what it usually is. The thought leaders have left. I occasionally check in to debate and hopefully knock some sense in, but usually it falls on deaf ears. People don’t like hearing what they don’t want to hear. 


Hence why it was able to run up so quickly for so long. 


Please give me a single person where who can describe what a block chain even is. That’s before we get into transaction structure. Let’s just start with the general structure of a block. Probably could count the amount of people here on a single hand.

Not at all. I’m equating resilience to literally the fact that the protocol can’t even be hijacked to change. Price has nothing to do with that. 
Value and price are not the same thing. Price is what you pay for realized value. If you don’t understand the value of an immutable transactional protocol that is so resilient it can’t change without near 100% cooperation of its non trusting participants, yet continues to work despite that, then I’m sorry, I can’t help you. 
Also, anyone who compares bitcoin to tulips has very little understanding of the tulip bubble (that never even actually happened as it was reported) in general.

Literally read that comment verbatim in 2014. Bitcoin isn’t valuable because it is excellent to transact with. The UE actually blows compared to alternatives like visa/Venmo. Even other cryptos are shit compared to them. 
Bitcoin is valuable because it is resilient. And still is resilient to the point it is almost impossible to change. There’s value in knowing something will be the same, act the same, and continue to be the same for the foreseeable future. Something literally no other coin has demonstrated to this point.

Any time someone makes a commit on a file there’s a beam from their avatar to that particular file. Directories are clumped together. 
All the floating avatars around sort of debunk the idea that there’s only a small group of less than 10 people making changes. In reality, many people make changes, and those who have made a lot of commits with respect to everyone else get to double check the code and make sure it meets standards and serves a purpose. But there’s actually a lot of people who make their own individual impact on the code.

Yes 15x over the year. Really more. And the point is 100% of the time it has done it, it has also crashed back down to 90% of what it was. You believe this time “it’s different^(TM)”?


Yes and you sell when it reaches that value or increases over that value. It’s called investing. We passed that level months ago. 


Yes, yes it matters entirely. That’s the point of investing is future price vs current price. Current price is far above what it will be within a year. Therefore, basic investment practices would tell you to sell it/short sell it. I know it’s hard but try to keep up. 


No, I asked specifically what non price related thing changed, and you answered with more price related information. 


Please source such bullshit claims. People bought houses and cars in 2013. Hell I paid off my car and other debts. It’s called realizing profits, especially when they are non sustainable. Please source an increase in any of these activities separate from anyone simply being an early adopter and cashing out. 


You keep telling yourself this, but look around... no one is spending it. Do you get paid in it?


Having been one who bought at the top of 2013, subsequently sold to cut losses and bought back 10 fold at the bottom, in can assure you it’s a better strategy than simply not cutting your losses. That’s just idiotic. With that logic, I still have a few coins I’ve written off, I’ll sell them to you at 19k... hell of a bargain long term. 


Yes a crash down to 2-5K range before the October time frame. Now you’re getting it. It’s called investing and reaping profits. 


I asked what substantial changes have been made. You never answered. You gave price data.


Segwit was ready to go a year ago, adoption hasn’t justified a 4x price increase since it was implemented and really no projects beyond lightning have made exclusive usage of the tx malleability fix, so that’s like second order speculation if I’ve ever seen it. 


As an active LN developer for a project, I can tell you we aren’t anywhere near the short term hype. If your price analysis is based solely on LN, I have bad news for you. 


Replace by fee was 2016 and far before any of the current hype. 


Such as? I follow the developer mailing list. I don’t believe you know what you are talking about, which is why we are going through this exercise. 


So you have to wait for a substantial drop to buy back in? If we go by your logic, every moment it is undervalued, so it would be best to buy as soon as you have access to money. You never know when the next sky rocket is. If dips like this don’t phase you from a loss standpoint, then surely they shouldn’t phase your from a profit standpoint. 


In fact, I know I have but that’s besides the point. 


Is it ready to compete with Venmo? No. Yet that’s how its touted. It’s closer to ACH than it is cash. No crypto currency will be “cash” at its base layer. And we are at least half a decade out before it gets to the point it is being advertised at. Meanwhile, everyone of these hype bubbles drills into people’s head bad connotations to bitcoin.

Your analogy makes 0 sense. 
It’s more like getting in an auction bidding war with a group of people, but only a small percentage of them have money to actually buy the item. You perceive their money to be just as valuable as yours, so it increases the price. When someone points out that they have no money, then you realize you just way overpaid for something. Now the market has no idea what the price is, but they know it is lower. A sell off is triggered, and likely a panic because no one knows the price it should be at that point. Does that mean the market price of the item you paid for it is now $0? No, but it certainly isn’t what you paid for it.

Again, more evidence that you most likely weren’t here in 2013. It will. Much, much further. We just entered the fear part of the bubble chart. We haven’t even reached capitulation. 
It will not rebound until every last fiber of your being is screaming at you for being a dumb fuck for putting money into something that clearly isn’t coming back. When all odds are against it. When the psychology of your mind literally has changed fundamentally to second and triple guessing yourself in that maybe you are wrong. 
It’s only after we hit that point, 6 months from now, where only developers and techies are back on the boards, and no one even mentions price because it was never about price that we will bottom out. Until then, it will be a long drawn out process of bull traps only getting about 80% of the way up the next one. Everyone cutting their losses and truly entering dismay. 
Ask me how I know. As someone who *actually* was here in 2013, and lost money, you are about to learn the real meaning of “hodl”. The meaning that started the meme. The meaning where no matter how much you are losing and no matter how bleak the future looks, it really doesn’t matter because the price never mattered in the first place. That’s what “hodl” means. That’s where the real money is made. 
And in 3-5 years when the next hype cycle comes around you aren’t a dumbass that “hodls” all the way through it because as people are just getting in, you are cashing out at an average of hundreds of % return for trusting your guy against all odds. 
That’s what’s about to happen. So any money you have in, prepare not to touch for a very very long time. Really, don’t just pretend tell yourself that, hoping it will jump back “as it always does”. Know it. Know that money will be inaccessible for years if not forever.

No, it has risen 15x it’s value only a handful of times, and 100% of the time it has crashed back down. 


Sure. But we aren’t 10 years from now, and the value is far more right now that what it’s actual use case is. 


Coming from the guy fixated entirely on price... read Mastering Bitcoin for once and then come talk to me. 


User base of what? Speculation? Literally less than 1% of bitcoin is used for anything of substance beyond hype driven speculation past about May of this year. Same thing happened in 2013. They all left following the crash. I expect this to be no different. Those who are in it to get rich quick don’t stick around when they aren’t getting rich. 


Such as? You still haven’t answered me. As a general developer, and someone who has read mastering bitcoin multiple times over, I can handle any “technology” concept you are referring too. But “ghost” technology doesn’t count. 


Lol, sure then, everyone here is investing in hindsight. Thanks for proving my point. 


So why did you not just purchase more from the get-go? Why wait until it rises substantially on the hopes it comes back down?


Quite the contrary. In fact, I’ve been here probably far longer than you, have made commits to the code base, and actually follow development. Instead, I just despise the hype and bullshit that sets bitcoin back because it further deteriorates the goal of the *actual technology* doing what it was designed to do. But sure.

A perfectly viable reason to cut your losses would be to look at the near 400% rise over 2-3 months and realize it wasn’t sustainable, look at the momentum of the price, and realize this is the burst of a mania and it will fall back to at least what it was before 2-3 months ago. 
This is even more so the case in your second situation. If for whatever reason you looked at it going to 19k and thought “well this will keep on going”, and it has now reversed about 50%, then chances are it will continue to reverse back to the point where the mania began. Hence, your analysis wasn’t fulfilled and you should cut your losses.

The point is, that statistically significant events are easier to identify as datasets grow and we can determine when something falls outside of the typical distribution (assuming it is even normally distributed). 
You shouldn’t use a sample when the entire dataset is available and feasible to work with. 100+ years of MLB data is big, but not necessarily infeasible in relation to computer hardware capabilities now days as opposed to the individual opinion of every human being on earth. That dataset is not readily available, and even if it was, not readily manipulatable. Opinions tend to be normally distributed with small standard deviations though, so sample sizes can lead to accurate inferential statistics with respect to the overall population. But again, because it’s a sample, it only relates to the overall dataset, it isn’t fully representative. 
When you have a workable full dataset, there’s really no reason not to use it, because you are just losing information. You can quite easily get fully descriptive statistics for the dataset. 
In other words, any predictions made on a dataset, based on the full population are one order of separation closer than predictions made off a sample of the dataset. Especially if that sample is purposefully manipulated (like leaving out data that works against your point).

The fact that you think this is going to turn around in a day or a week shows just how *not* long term you are. 
I’m super long as well. I have been since 2014 where I lost money. But having lost money in 2014, I recognize it’s going to take years to recover just like it did this past go round. 
“Long term” is over the span of decades. So in the near term (the span of weeks to months) its momentum is going to carry this far below where it is now. Sure it will be lower than it will be long term, but ask the guy who bought the top of 2014 if he would have liked to wait to 2015 and his answer would be a resounding yes. Even though he got in at $1200. 
Thinking this thing is going to just jettison back up in a week shows that you still are caught in the mania that caused the meteoric rise and now the astonishing crash. 
Those of us who are actually long term and have been long term recognized the abnormal behavior roll in around October and sold over the past few months.

This is bullshit. I can mandate that you pay me for my services in bitcoin because for whatever reason I choose it has utility to me, and it immediately has an intrinsic value to me, and you have to acquire it somehow if you want my services (intrinsically valuable to you). I can tell you accounting firms see the intrinsic value of a medium of exchange that is 100% traceable and provable as to the source and designation of the payment. 
I happen to find it intrinsically valuable as something fixed in quantity, with relative scarcity and transactional properties that make it fulfill properties of a traditional inflation hedge, and an exit from manipulated central bank economies. That’s an intrinsic value to me. 
And as I said, if the time comes where people lose trust in the system (and greshams law says they will), and it’s up to me accepting usd that inflated by a few percentage points a day, or hold something with a mathematically provable quantity, guess which one I’m choosing. And if you need my services.... you’ll have to acquire some or move onto someone else who is willing to accept the inflating currency. 
Understanding where bitcoin assumes its value from is something that takes time, and takes questioning what trade and money are in general. You won’t go from “what is bitcoin” to understanding it’s roll within the same conversation. That takes months or years of pondering, and then using it, and thinking about money every time you use it. This is why, when the price goes up 4x in 2 months you can call bullshit. Because the world didn’t have an epiphany, and no countries collapsed to the point of it becoming a refuge (like it did for Greece in 2013). It was obviously mania. 
But if you are going to sit here and argue it could easily be worth, $0, it shows that you really haven’t thought about what money is, and haven’t pondered why bitcoin *isn’t* zero long enough. And it will be the reason why you will miss the next run up when it comes as well. Because this isn’t going to zero. 2k? 1k? $500?! One could dream... $0? Laughable at best. 
There’s a reason that after every one of these speculative bubbles it doesn’t die, and usually settles higher than it was before. It was about $1k rolling into this. Let’s see if I’m right in a year.

Not really. You are presuming that bitcoin will be worth more in the future, so by that logic, anytime, dip or no dip, would be equally as good of a time to buy (because we are clearly ignoring the ability to buy more as the price goes lower). 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:44:57
No there aren't. Every other coin has a "foundation". Bitcoin just requires pretty much unanimous consensus. If anyone controlled the code it would be easy to implement their upgrades. Yet, it took over a year for Segwit to be adopted and there is no hardfork for increased block size. So please, point to these "people" who control bitcoin please.

That doesn’t mean that you can exclude it and then still draw useful conclusions. That’s not how data works. 
Instead what you do, is present the data as is, add a footnote for any suspected outliers, and then over time if you are correct, it will show. But you can’t just exclude it. For all you know, 2014 is the usual, and we have just had a string of very unusual events. You won’t know until the law of averages works out over time. 
Do we just neglect the Great Depression from stock market data? Or do we instead note that period as a particularly unorthodox year and attach our suspected reasoning to it? And the longer we go without another Great Depression, the more we can confirm our predictions that it won’t likely happen again if the conditions are not the same as they were during that period. 
Having been here since about mid 2013 onward, I can tell you that these past 4 months have drawn parallel to 2013/2014 far closer than they have any time since. Where in the provided data does it show a massive positive momentum swing, resulting in 15x Times the price ytd? 2014 has that. No other year does. And one thing we know is that moving average momentum does swing back in the opposite direction when it overextends. I would say we are far closer to 2013/2014 characteristics at this point than any other point in the provided data. Which is why it is important to keep outlier data and have a holistic approach when available.

The price of anything it is spent on artificially rises. Ie, the entire crypto bubble we are currently in. 
If I’m just issuing money and giving it away from free, then it would have no effect on the prices no. But do you really believe that’s what was happening?
The tethers being issued were spent on things. Those things were effectively stolen, in addition to manipulated in their markets because there was always someone ready to buy “higher” because it cost nothing to them. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:30:23
So there’s no intrinsic value for a completely immutable transactional protocol? TIL. 
I never predicted 15x price rise, but I could tell you without at doubt 5-10 was possible over a decade. That’s how investing works. 
And when it rises because of obvious mania, you collect profits, you don’t “hodl” and you wait for the mania to blow over because it isn’t sustainable. Meanwhile, developers are still at work, still making more software with even more intrinsic value. Not 19K worth at the moment, but the potential to be 19k in the distant future yes. So when I see 10k,12k,15k,19k show up, yes I sell because I’m not an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:13:51
Because getting “everyone” to agree on anything isn’t practical. Hence the quotes around “everyone”. 
When those who don’t even know what reddit is decide to keep selling, or someone takes a look at the momentum and realizes “well shit, it’s not stopping at $5000”, you will get slaughtered if your number is still $5000.

Sample sizes are only for datasets where the entire dataset either isn’t available, or is infeasible to analyze.

There’s a difference between regular growth and mania. 
We were undergoing regular growth up until around may this year. You can’t call the rush of new money that gives 0 shit about what Segwit is, or what a bech32 address is the same as regular growth, that’s mania. Their mission was to get rich quick.
There’s been no widespread adoption other than people widespread noticing massive gains. If you ask someone if you can pay in bitcoin, chances are they are going to either a) say yes so that they can speculatively hold it or b) say no because they don’t trust it. Either way, velocity has gone down not up. 
So if you are saying bitcoin is worth more than $0, I would agree with you there. If you are saying anything in the past 6 months has a shred of legitimacy to it, I would completely disagree with you there.

Instead, all that changed was a bunch of people who don’t even know what segwit is buying in, with the expectation that it would continue to rise. For anyone who was here in 2013, it was scary how similar it was.

Just because it’s an “outlier” doesn’t mean it should be neglected from your dataset. You should simply be able to recognize it and qualify it as an outlier if over time it grossly shows not to conform to the rest of the distribution. Yet another reason to use the entire dataset when it is available. 
Outliers simply affect samples because they skew the relationship towards the outlier’s weight, and away from the actual relationship that an ideal sample would have (ideally having the same distribution characteristics of the population data). But you can mitigate that problem entirely by simply using the full dataset. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:55:58

But you must be right. I don’t know what I’m talking about. Keep living in your bubble.

Payment networks are designed to transmit an asset at an end user level. They are separate. Bitcoin isn’t a payment network. It’s a transactional protocol, and the bitcoins themselves live within the protocol. The protocol, as you a developer should know, works great. Far better than any other traditional settlement network in fact. ACH is the protocol level for modern payment networks. ACH is where USD “live” when not on someone’s balance sheet. 
And on that settlement network, we build payment networks. Just as fiat was once a receipt for gold, and Venmo is a way to transact fiat, all sorts of payment networks will be built as the end user experience of transmitting bitcoin. 
One thing bitcoin has that no other coin has proven? Resilience. Not price resilience... protocol resilience. We can hardly change it if we want to. But it keeps on working just as it was designed to do. No one can change it. No one can manipulate it. It just chugs along, reaching consensus every 10 minutes or so completely ambivalent to the rest of the world. As a developer, don’t you like stability? Knowing that when you send an API request it will continue to work the same way every time? As an investor, don’t you like the fact that no one can decide to change the underlying asset? If everyone gets robbed, there really shouldn’t be a god switch to revert that. We don’t revert when someone steals gold.
It isn’t usable at an end user experience, but realistically no coin is. Venmo is instant and free and people don’t roll their eyes when I want to pay them with Venmo. Until a coin is literally instant and free with a UX the same as Venmo, all are failures as a cash system. The only thing any crypto currency has proven to do well is offer an immutable/permissionless way of transacting, with an absolute provable supply. All other coins who have modified to be more user friendly compromise on these things of actual value. Very few coins bring anything new to the table, and those that do are simply going to find themselves being the test chain for a side chain that will anchor itself into bitcoin in the future. That’s the way of life. Because if bitcoin isn’t value, then what makes any other coin valuable? What’s to say the coin that replaces bitcoin won’t be replaced. 
So really, there’s no reason to develop those payment networks on anything *but* bitcoin imo. Alts are cool poc coins, and fun to use cutting edge features... but if you had me put my trust and money in any coin long term, there’s absolutely no other coin that I trust more than bitcoin... literally, the coin that we can’t hardly change if we want to.

The vast majority of people here are young and have minimal if any external income, other than their paper profits from speculative rises. 
There's literally posts here talking about that's what they do for a living, or that they made more doing this than they ever would in a day job, as if the returns we've seen to date are sustainable beyond a few more years at most. 
All of this short sightedness and unrealistic expectations is a recipe for disaster when the hype wears off, and it will, with time it always does.

2 forks happened at same time: Segwit Fork and Big Block Fork.
You seem to have a very elementary understanding of bitcoin. A "soft fork" is a tightening of the existing rules. Nothing changed. You can participate without actually changing anything. Not so for the "big block fork" which is why the big block fork got a new name (hence it required active participation). Why would we change the name of the coin when you literally have to do nothing different to participate?


Great. That was also a horrible idea, as evidenced by the later spamming.


Your point is? There was a hard fork to get to bitcoin cash. Are you seriously denying that?


No, its literally the truth. 


I made commits to the original satoshi client, I'm aware of the situation.


So it's a fact there was not a hard fork to bitcoin cash? Interesting.

What? You clearly don’t understand anything about investing if that’s what you think it is. 
Investing is buying something at a lower value with a reasonable expectation that you can sell it at a higher value in the future. That requires having a finger on the pulse of its intrinsic value as seen by the majority of the market. If the price far exceeds that value, either your model is wrong and you should fix it, or the asset is overvalued and you should collect your profits and buy it after it corrects. 
Traditional investing also includes the promise of future cash flow, which further increases something’s intrinsic value. 
But just buying random shit and parking your money isn’t “investing”. Not in the least. Investing requires an understanding of what you are buying.

My argument is a loss is a loss. Both are still losing to Visa. How can you be happy about a loss? Meanwhile, bitcoin has at least a viable scaling plan beyond "lets just make it bigger". Therefore, of both coins that are failing, Bitcoin shows the most promise.


If that's what you want to call it sure. So is Doge btw I guess by your definition.


If you want to be electronic cash, you certainly do need to beat Venmo/Visa... That's the current competition. If not, then what is your goal here? It certainly can't be a store of value. I do recognize there's intermediary steps, hence the first post. Nothing is broken. Its still working exactly as planned. Just because we aren't there *yet* means nothing.


What has fallen behind? Market cap? Demand? Last time I checked there's literally people ****willing*** to spend $10+ to send a transaction. Doesn't sound like we are dying for customers does it? Meanwhile, its the only coin that is truly immutable? Some autistic kid loses his money to a hack? Lets just fork it off and call the original coin "classic"... No thanks. 










Ok, well bitcoin.org is wrong. Bitcoin doesn't belong to anyone, its a protocol.


Yes, because transfer layers are coming, but they need to be backed by an asset of value... meanwhile, you guys have inflation higher than every central bank in the world for the next 10-20 years. Excellent plan.

No its not sustainable, but neither is growing the lock size. At least the way it exists makes for a very secure and resilient, albeit exclusive system. Maybe BTC is meant to be just that... the backbone and primary chain on which the most secure and largest transactions are made, leaving it to be the most decentralized, most resilient to change recognized asset of value, that everything else is based on. 
I don't care what a whitepaper 9 years old planned to do. I care about reality and what this system has proven to do well and understanding what it faults at. The microwave oven wasn't originally intended to do what it does either. And if it takes layers built on top to achieve what it originally set out to do, so be it. 
But as far as I can see, no coin, has achieved what was described in the whitepaper. So they all fail. That doesn't mean that the entire system fails and is void of all value. In fact, bitcoin is very good at its niche use case and that is to provide a very secure and immutable/uncensorable way to control what we recognize as an asset that will retain a reasonable amount of its value tomorrow and for the foreseeable future. 
Cell phones were expensive as shit at first too. It took a decade and a half for the technology to get to a point of being cheap enough for ubiquity, and another decade and a half to actually reach ubiquity. So sorry, if it's expensive for bitcoin in under a decade. But growing the block size, or unilaterally making changes to the system without full economic support completely sucks bitcoin dry of the only thing it is good at..... not changing.

You don’t seem to connect the dots that if tether has nothing backing it, it’s no better than any other shitcoin, and in fact is arguably worse because it is openly fraudulent. The value will go to zero or very near zero almost immediately.  There’s a lot of harm done. If you have $50k in tether right now, expecting it to actually be backed by $50k, you’re going to be in for quite a shock if there’s not actually anything behind it. What do you think gives tether its value? Why do you believe there’s no harm done in simply creating value out of thin air. 
Not to mention, it brings into question how much bitcoin was bought with literally non existent money. If tethers influenced the book value, then you need to ask how much of that was people simply paying far more than the market was actually willing to accept for it? At that point, bitcoin, and any other coin that was bought with tethers is effectively massively overvalued, by an undetermined amount. There will be a correction.

False, fees really haven’t risen in relation that much. What has risen is the price, thus satoshis, what fees are priced in have become more expensive. The “recent stagnation” is a result of no more new money coming in. Otherwise bitcoin would be the only coin crashing. Instead, it has been consistently in the top 10 least losing coins percentage wise. 


Segwit happened in August and nothing was done with it afterwards to warrant a 400% increase in price. 
Lightning clients are still in beta and again, don’t justify a 400% increase without being purely speculation. I would know, I actually play a development role on a lightning based project. 


And every time it has had a 15x run up it has come back down. I was there in 2013. I made a shit ton more money this time around. And I will be buying back in when the mania is gone, and we return to earth and it has a valuation back at what it should be based off it’s current use case.

It removes a large portion of extra bloat from the part of the block that counts as transaction size. Bitcoin fees don't depend on the amount sent, they depend on the size of the transaction. Think of it like sending a check in the mail. If it fits in the envelope it sends and the postage is the same for a $10M check as it is for a $1 check. 
By removing the extra bloat, the fee is less for you, as well as it opens more space for other transactions, which helps the overall transaction speed by reducing the backlog.

Fucking please. It is an outright attempt to conflate the two coins which is why they feel the need to add "Core" to the end of bitcoin, to make the classifier "cash" seem just as legitimate (btc has always been the ticker for **B**i**TC**oin, not "bitcoin core"). It's the reason they get so upset at when it is called bcash, because it loses that connection. It's the reason he uses bitcoin.com and ties the two numbers of total addresses created into the same number figure (we don't tie Litecoin and bitcoin figures together even though they are effectively the same).
Bcash is a fraudulent effort through and through. It's a shame that people won't do their own due diligence before getting tricked by it, but that's the free market. Hopefully they learn. 
Bcash's scaling outlook is so amateurishly pathetic that *if* they ever miraculously gain enough traffic to have to scale, they will realize the flaws immediately. That's a massive *if* as well considering most people would simply use a better established coin. Something like Doge has been around longer than Bcash and doesn't have as astonishingly terrible of a rep in its short lifespan. Why not use Doge?

Sure let's work with that set of goalposts, because you seem to be moving them around.
If someone with a "good job" in the tech field, which we have already established is a minimum of at least $80K, has the goal in mind of putting $40K away, it is not very difficult at all, especially with $23500 available to be put away before taxes.

There are currently 3 different implementations being developed, with an agreed upon set of standards to work together (BOLT). LND is the implementation I am most familiar with, but there's another 2 I can't remember off the top of my head. 


Still sort of up in the air how it will actually work in practice, but there's no set limit. theoretically you can transfer back and forth in a channel forever. You will need to either settle off chain and rebalance a channel or close and reopen a channel when it gets unbalanced. 


Currently there's a .16BTC limit per channel for development reasons. Still to be seen if there will be an upper limit. 


Depends what you want to consider "usable". In terms of what everyone is imagining in their heads like this will solve all of our problems, that's going to take years. However, multihop payments are 100% possible on the test net, and more importantly, vendor channels can be opened and are going to be the first real development that is ready for mainstream in the very near future. Essentially trustless tabs, to for example, buy minutes for a cellphone. 
It is important that LN doesn't get hyped as *the only* scaling solution, because chances are at this point, it's not going to live up to the immediate expectations. It's a great step in the right direction, but it shouldn't be seen as a savior that is going to solve all the problems as soon as it comes out. It's going to take many years before it is perfected, but it will be perfected and it will work over the long term, along with other scaling proposals and features, including block size changes.

If the price of electricity rises, then the miners turn off.
Andreas' "green coin" point was that you can fund the infrastructure of an under utilized plant run on green energy.

A private key is a random number. Plain and simple. However, it's a number in a very very *very* large pool of numbers. 2^256 in fact. That's on the order of the number of atoms in the universe. 
Bitcoin uses a type of cryptography called elliptic curve cryptography, which basically uses a branch of math that uses an elliptic curve function, to relate two numbers. 
Basically, by picking any number on the curve, any multiple of that number will also be on the curve. So we use a fixed multiple called G, and after picking a truly random number, we multiply it by G to get our public key. Because we know G, it's trivially easy to get to the public key from the private key. However, it's not possible to go in reverse. The only way to get the private key from a public key would be to calculate each and every key up until that number in a brute force method.
Since there's a fixed relationship between the public and private key, we can use [ECDSA]( to "prove" ownership. 
It's security through large numbers really. A badly chosen PK though, could be guessed fairly easily though. For example, the private key "5" is a bad key. As is basically any binary form of any word in any language, or anything attached to some sort of recognizable thing in the real world. It's a strange concept, because our brains can't think on that scale, but the odds of winning the lottery multiple times in a row far exceed the ability to find a key with value in it at random. Even if you do, the value would be extremely small, as most wallets in use just have dust. 
There's a good video on this that was basically my ahah moment, were the guy explains the security like keeping money in a dresser drawer and storing it in public. If you have 1 drawer it's trivially easy to find the money and steal. 4 drawers may take slightly longer but still easy. 400 drawers, substantially longer but still doable. But the logic follows that some marginal amount of time and money is required to find the money as the number of draws increase. So if we make the number of draws so astronomically large, it effectively becomes impossible and not worth it to try to steal them. Think about how people get lost at sea. Now imagine being the size of an atom and being "lost" in the universe. That's why it's effectively impossible to guess a private key. 
So to answer your second question, it entirely depends on the level of security needed. A key generated through an online wallet is only as strong as the code that generated it. You could theoretically  have a screen capturing virus. Or a key logger. Or your printer could have a virus. All of these possibilities are small and not worth the stress for something like $5, but what if you now have $5M? It changes the scope of the problem. I would recommend a HW wallet to anyone who has over $1K in crypto.

Absolutely not. Governments are just like every other organization in that they are inherently self serving. Why would any government official want to reduce the nanny state when their very own job depends on it existing?
The solution is a drastically smaller government, that should really only exist for the purpose of allocating funds to professionals who know what they are doing, and those professionals should be operating in full view, available for public audit by anyone. And there needs to be a solid line between the responsibilities of the federal government and the local governments. Federal government is there for national defense and interstate commerce. It isn't there to provide housing or food or roads or bridges (with the exception of interstates because again, interstate commerce).
The government does too much already. It needs to be reduced in size 10 fold at least. Fortunately Bitcoin removes the ability to tax through inflation and deficit spending effectively, so they will have a much harder time funding these shenanigans in the future.

Well there's no telling when the crash will be, how high it will go before and where it will crash to. And it's a little concerning hearing the "win" used in this sense because it fuels the speculative nature of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin shouldn't be thought of as something to make you more rich. The entire purpose of bitcoin is to exit the current manipulated fiat system. I don't think of it as "winning" per say more than simply having choice available. 
However, as a disclaimer I have taken a fair amount off the table as a hedge and have it available to buy during when I expect there to be a crash. I can tell you 20-50% per day is not sustainable. There's a crash coming. When and how much is anyone's guess. I think it will be quite stark after futures markets open.

I happen to be a mechanical engineer in the power generation business, and I do not see it as a long term problem at all. People tend to extrapolate the rise in hash power as if it will continue forever which is simply false. And again, with nuclear energy, it's really not a concern at all in my eyes. 
With regards to the libertarian aspects, once again, bitcoin is ridiculously resilient, so there's really no way to properly take it down, as it has been shown over this past decade. The ability to acquire and hold sound money has serious implications to the Keynesian nightmare we have all been locked into, and there's no way around it. Whether you like it or not, Austrian economics will finally have a way to flourish instead of being oppressed by governments with a stranglehold on currency generation. The Keynesian system can try and compete, but Gresham's law will make it very very difficult to compete. The cat is finally out of the bag and it isn't going back in, no matter how many rules and regulations you try and throw at it, even under the guise of "protecting the environment".

What happens if there's a debt collapse like there was in 2008 and there's a mad rush to bitcoin because it's more accessible than gold? Again, a new, much bigger market force takes over and its no longer a bubble.

Sure its fine, but if bitcoin drops below your value point, it makes sense to buy it. Buying an undervalued stock doesn't *guarantee* anything either. Lets say your BTC price was $5, and it drops down to $3, you should buy that because you know it is worth more than its market value.


[You sort of did...]( Not directly, but laughing at the fact that bitcoin has the potential to act as a sound currency and have Gresham's law enacted on it at any point in the future is most certainly taken by most people that you don't believe it can ever be money.


In the short term its going to drop much farther than 25%... That's not what we are talking about. Remove the current situation from your argument.

That's not for me or you to decide. That's for the market to decide. Are you suggesting that people can't act in their own free will and shouldn't be able to decide how much energy/resources they dedicate to bitcoin?

In other words... not trustless. 


I 100% guarantee you won't win an arms race with Amazon and Google and Facebook. Blocks will be 1TB blocks before you even have a say. And at that point, you won't have a say because they aren't your consensus rules. What happens when nodes get to, as Craig Wright puts it "$20k", and Google and Amazon offer $5 per month node access? At that point, why would anyone offer their node connection for free? Ever tried to use a free proxy or VPN? So if node access is $5 per month, why would google and Amazon not go for 1TB blocks? Think of the volume... your measly fucking $20k node won't mean shit in the grand scheme. You'll need a $20M data center at that point. 


No, that's the point. It won't be available to you if you can't run a node. Permissioned access through paid nodes is the future of BCH if it ever shakes the scam coin status. Talk about KYC/AML. 
Good luck with that though. Should be fun.

It hasn't been 24 hours and a single exchange has opened. 
Wait until it comes time for the first contract to expire. Things are about to get very volatile and you don't have the capital to buy enough to calm it. Either hold through it all or sell and wait for it to settle, but don't get cocky that nothing will happen at all.

Yes, fractional reserve lending is entirely possible, it just isn't possible to bail them out. Mt Gox was fractionally reserving for months. 
If you put your coins into a service like Coinbase, or any other exchange, they go into a conglomerate collection of coins, and when you ask for them back, they can send you valid coins. This is no different from current banking. The difference is, in the case of something like Mt Gox, they can pretend like there's coins to pay everyone back, but there really aren't. When the price was high they were able to have enough money to remain solvent, however when the price plummeted, they no longer had the money you pay everyone back.
If you and I and Alice and Bob and Charlie all deposit one bitcoin, it's possible to lend out 1 Bitcoin to Dave and Emily each, and tell us that we still all have one bitcoin. Coinbase could have 3 BTC on reserve, and as long as all 5 of us don't want to get that out bitcoin out simultaneously the entire scheme works. If we do run on the bank however, they have no way of giving us our money back since they only have 3 BTC, even though everyone's balance shows 1BTC with the service. 
Costly credit isn't a problem because saving and earning from interest become feasible again. Lending is necessary in an economy, but so is failures due to risk. If we socialize the failures, people don't learn and it gets worse and worse. Banks will fractionally reserve bitcoin in the future, but they will have to be much more cognizant of their reserve levels knowing they don't have the backup of the fed. This will lead to much smaller booms, but much shorter healthy busts as well.

First transaction from Coinbase to BTC-E so I could buy alts (because just like today alts were ssoooo much better than bitcoin):
Tx 2 a few days later, to do more of the same (notice the same receiving address): 
And then finally my TX 3 back from BTC-E at a 28% loss from getting burnt by all the hype around alt coins (the 2.87 btc txo): 
Then after cashing out in early 2014 I bought back heavily throughout 2015 and 2016.

They will physically manipulate the bitcoin markets to meet the contract conditions that they want. There doesn't need to be a link for that. For example, if I sell short on $15K, then it is to my benefit to make the price crash just before expiration, or at least be lower than $15K.

Holy straw man argument batman. It's impossible to have realistic expectations?


Make it illegal. It has worked great everywhere they've tried that. 
And you don't get to use the bitcoin 2.0 argument without pointing to a valid 2.0. 


You don't have to know specifics to have an understanding on the market conditions. I think it falls back down to sub 3000 and stays there for years before it ever gets to PM status. But on a long enough timeline, knowing what I know about the actual technology, it isn't going away. 


So because some people (most likely newcomers) are stupid, we should just scrap the whole thing? Do you know the miseducation that was rampant in the dot com bubble? Good thing we scrapped that internet idea. 


If you "invest" during a speculative bubble, yes you are gambling. Hence why I literally sold 10s of thousands of dollars worth just a few days ago. Admittedly I missed out on another $15K, but I'm not an idiot and understand speculative bubbles when I see them. 


It isn't completely irrelevant. Because making a competitor doesn't make another bitcoin. Many have already tied. Why is gold the primary jewelry metal? Other metals just can't compete? Or is it the network effect of understanding value. 


Well yes, it very much has the best shot at doing that. It isn't ready yet, because we still have fungibility and scaling issues, but I trust bitcoin much more than fiat long term. 


I agree with this. I don't think it will happen for a decade at least, but I most definitely think it will happen. 


Yes, again, you seem to think this is the first time this has ever happened. This happens regularly. And every time people get out of hand, and idiots lose money. And every time, development doesn't stop afterwards and we charge forwards. It has always "crashed" anywhere between 2X and 10x it's previous low, so a few more of these and they are no longer an issue. Especially if over time bitcoin becomes older than those buying. 


Based off of my analysis of bitcoin over the course of about 5 years now, I don't believe bitcoin will be replaced. Sure I can be wrong. I doubt it. 


I would say that's a fair analysis.

Clearly you don't understand how a) free markets work or b) how mining works. 
A) free markets guarantee the most cost efficient way of doing something, not the "most decentralized" or the whatever other subjective wish you want
B) mining ***pools*** are ***relatively centralized***. Mining pools are made up of many individual miners. What is "decentralized"? From a computer science standpoint it means no single central point. It's not a binary. Saying "decentralized" on its own with no objective goals is fucking stupid. We could roll block sizes back so far that I could turn my smart tv in a node and make it *more decentralized*... should we do that?
Miners simply offer blocks to the network. They can't do anything special. Worrying about mining is the biggest FUD of all. 


Clearly you, begging the pineapple fund to make mining viable for you. 


I'm sorry, but out of respect for people who have been and *currently are in slavery* you can straight up find a rusty baton and shove it so far up your ass that you get anal fucking  tetanus.

It can be undervalued long term, and overvalued short term. Markets are based on competing market forces with different outlooks and takes on the situation. 
Right now I would say the speculative "get rich quick" crowd has a far stronger voice than those looking for regular use, or even as a gold alternative. Quite frankly it isn't ready for either of those at the moment, however it has much of that in development. 
I think there will be at least one more spectacular bubble burst in the near future. After it pops, stick around these boards for about a year after and you will be surprised how many people are still involved and doing good work. It's crazy to see the influx of new people, who crowd out the conversation, and can't see beyond the price. Those are the weakest hands because their interest wains very quickly when price talk is no longer positive. It doesn't detract from the underlying work that is done, and the long term viability of bitcoin actually doing what it promises to do *eventually* though.

The difference is that forking still doesn't change the amount of valid "bitcoin". It's the equivalent of Zimbabwe printing trillions of "dollars". Sure they are "dollars" but that doesn't mean they are accepted in place of USD. 
This is why it's important for the public to have unfettered access to a node, trustlessly. Because with a node, it is 100%, literally verifiably impossible, to accept "fake" bitcoin. The value is either in the ledger or it isn't. No amount of forks will change that original ledger.

If Alice wants to pay Charlie, and you, Bob, have an open connection with them both but they don't have a connection with each other, you can act as a trustless intermediary "hop" between the two. Through cryptography you can prove that someone was paid, so you can lock the payments along the way until the Charlie gets his payment buy giving the solution to the proof.
So you can run a lightning network node, fund a bunch of different channels, and you have more of a chance of being used as a connecting hop. Its probably not going to be as easy to run efficiently as just loading up some freeware software, but it will be nowhere near the level of involvement as mining is.

Think of it this way. If you write a simple script, do you go through all the optimization you can to squeeze out every last ms of performance? Probably not because it won't be perceived any different for the amount of work done. 
So you are probably coding in a slightly (or maybe even very) wasteful way, but you don't care because the effects are minimal. Same thing happens with the blocks. If there's no incentive to make transactions smaller and cheaper, it turns into a tragedy of the commons type situation. And when more room is available, people see that as more features they can add, adding more waste.

 Yes, living with roommates is not too terribly out of the ordinary up to your early 30s. And getting married, from a financial standpoint is basically just getting a (hopefully also income generating) roommate and gaining tax advantages. Two streams of income now, with still shared majority of expenses. And yes, the going salary for a software developer with ~2-3 years of experience is mid 80s to low 90s normal, and not unheard of to start breaking 100K....
I'm not even directly involved with software development. I'm a mechanical engineer, and yes, salary is comparable especially with site related work (per diem is latin for 'blessing from the gods')...


Where did 5 years turn into 15 years? And like I said, a spouse from a financial standpoint is another roommate. Lets not even get started with the amount of people still living with their parents until late 20s now days.


You act like living comfortably costs more than 40K per year... That would be stretching it really. I know families that make ~60K per year combined and live just fine.... With kids. If you can make 90K per year, and can't save the extra top end of that salary (and that is your goal), you should check your expenses because you are probably living out of your means.
You are also completely neglecting the entire purpose of this discussion as well, which is figuring out how the hell he got to $4M... This is not to say everyone can have $4M... This is simply proving it is entirely doable if someone is dedicated to the goal and conditions line up... Tech related job since the late 80s, living through both the dot com era and housing bubble *and* the current bubble (probably will be known as the QE bubble), with the goal of saving from the beginning sounds pretty much like the conditions lining up to me. Throw in some vague luck with timing the markets, its not impossible at all.
The fact still remains though, even if $40K per year was out of reach of tech workers (it isn't), we could take that down to $20K, or even $10K, and apply the same 'luck profile' to it, and its not at all to be impossible to get to $1M. I don't care if you are a teacher, if you can't find 10K to stock away per year for 30 years, you are *most definitely* living out of your means, and you need to re-evaluate your decision educating our youth with bad habits like that.

A node that is being used, i.e. Wallet softwares being pointed at it, is economically useful, however there's no particular need for 1000s because a wallet software can only connect to 1 at a time. If you receive payments regularly you should use a full node. If you broadcast payments regularly and are concerned about privacy, you should use a full node. 
If you are just going to run a node, just to say you are running a node, you are doing nothing to help the network. There only realistically needs to be one honest node for any particular person to connect to. If number of nodes was dropping to a few hundred, I would be worried. But adding a node to a group of literally thousands, when you have no real need for it, is just stupid.
It can actually reduce network performance, because actually active nodes will treat your node like any other node and will allocate bandwidth and resources to updating your node. So the the bandwidth that node is using to update your nonused node, there is potentially another node that needs the block information, that has to wait in line behind your useless node.
There seems to be this militant mindset amongst people who own like .01 BTC with no intentions on spending it, that running a node, or in some cases they spin up multiple nodes, somehow protects their investment. It really stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what a node even is, which is more concerning than any amount of nodes or lackthereof could ever be. If you don't even know why you are running a node, you likely shouldn't be running one.

Clearly you don't understand how bitcoin works. A satoshi is the smallest unit representable by the core protocol because that's all that's needed at the moment. But bitcoin is a state machine and moving that float is trivially easy should we need to. In fact, you can send sub satoshi levels on LN. 


Rapid deflation of money is what causes issues, not the general lowering of prices. Tell me, why do you have a computer to be able to reply to me on here? You realize if you would have waited to buy it, that computer would be even cheaper later. Or you could have gotten a better one later at the same cost. Do you need to eat? Why would you spend money on food today if your money could buy more in a month?
The reason we inflate a money supply is so that the representation of an abstract unit of value stays the same over time as humans do economically productive actions and wealth increases over time. If the pie gets bigger, we keep making the slices smaller. 
And the time value of money doesn't break down. What an asinine statement to make. Are you telling me, that I can't have an agreement with you, to give you money, and you pay me back some specified amount of interest over time? Is that truly impossible with bitcoin?
No, the difference is, when I give you money, you are getting actual money and I get an IOU in return. Under the current fractional reserve scheme, the bank gives *you* an IOU and you give back an IOU and money is created out of thin air. So when you fail to deliver on that IOU, the bank can't fill their other IOUs because they were depending on you. This leads to a lot of IOUs that were perceived as money to fail, and there's a scramble for actual assets and real money (hence your rapid deflation). Every single recession is caused this way. The recession/depression isn't the problem, it's the boom caused by money that wasn't there. 


Oh fuck off. Credit expansion has caused literally all financial crises to date. The Federal Reserve was created and promptly created the largest bubble ever followed by the greatest depression ever.
[And quantitative easing is literally the definition of creating wealth inequality]( When you give banks the power to buy assets with money they created out of thin air, before costs rise, you make them far more wealthy which is exactly what we've seen. Sorry, but the Keynesian model doesn't work outside of a classroom. 


What a dumb thing to say. Of course your outright misclaiming of a statistic is bullshit. And no, I'm going on record as someone who believes in facts and as someone with a bachelors degree of science I know the importance of questioning evidence until it is confirmed. Keep spouting your ad homemims though. Makes you look sharp ��.


That's in fact exactly what you should do when someone's scientific model cannot predict anything, because that means it's a terrible model. Science is being able to explain, reproduce, and predict the results of scientific phenomenon. I take it you have 0 background in science. 


Rational choice theory is literally the fundamental axiom of economic models. Robert Schiller simply proved my point in that people don't act rationally, thus basically pointing out all economic models that assume it are erroneous. You are proving my point here. 
? Economists think Bitcoin is a bubble because it exhibits virtually all the characteristic properties of historical bubbles since the dawn of financial markets. As to *when* Bitcoin will crash is not near as obvious.
Is it in a short term bubble? Sure. Is any value over $0 a bubble? Absolutely not.


It in fact has been through several. Greece in 2013 was actually the first one and people did exactly as you would expect, they bought bitcoin sending it up to $200+, before "crashing" down to twice its original value before the spike. People ran to in in India when they devalued the money as well. 




Because that copyright regulation has tanked BitTorrent right? Nations can regulate themselves out of bitcoin, but they can't regulate bitcoin out of existence. They've tried and it simply flourishes underground. 


So because it hasn't been present in "traditional financial markets" it can't be money? Interesting, I don't recall shells and feathers ever being used in "traditional markets" yet those were used as money. That burger I bough just the other day sure was delicious to not have been real.

You can look into making a paper wallet, however you need to be careful with what you use to generate the private keys. 
If you have more than $1000 worth you should look into a hw wallet. Anything less, paper wallet or your phone.
Theorhetically, the next best thing is to get a reputable wallet like bread wallet, generate the seed, write it down, and then delete the app and possibly wipe the phone entirely clearing all cache. The seed then becomes a fairly reliable paper wallet, at least for smallish amounts. 
Any mega amounts need mutiple paper wallets created on an operating system that has never seen the internet, and if the amount is large enough the code of whatever is being generated should be read in full. We're talking about millions for this level of paranoia though. A few K, a paper/hw wallet will suffice just fine.

More specifically I am in energy infrastructure construction. The costs are high specifically because of the meaningless record tracking that is required. It is all in well meaning, but it is 100% worthless. Most records come in the form of hand signatures and initials on drawings that have hand done redlines. Even if the information was useful, it would be impossible to track after the fact. But it's done because legally they have to track all of that because when you use the word nuclear, people freak out. In reality, the navy has been doing it incident free for half a century now. 


And once again, this is the cost of having a decentralized, resilient currency out of the hands of any central control. 110% worth every drop of fuel thrown at it.

That's the entire point of bitcoin. You know what the most efficient system is? Fascism. Doesn't make it the best system.
The problem you are having with your realization is you aren't defining what "efficient" even is.... I'm an engineer, so I deal with efficiencies all day long... Efficiency is literally defined 99% of the time as Actual Output/Desired Output.... So you can be efficient *in certain areas and not efficient in others*. Bitcoin is not efficient in speed or price for P2P transactions.... ***yet***. It is very efficient at keeping your coins from seizure. It has been pretty efficient over most long enough periods of time for storing (and growing) wealth. It is extremely efficient at having millions of constituents come to agreement to how to settle the financial status of the planet. 144x faster at the least in fact.


You are fundamentally missing the point of bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a new way of sending money. Bitcoin is an exodus of the fractional reserve lending, centralized trust system. So no, none of what you have listed "does the same thing" more efficiently. In fact, none of them "do the same thing as bitcoin" at all. So in fact, they are the least efficient method of doing what bitcoin does.


You keep pointing to energy consumption as if its a problem. It isn't. Its a market based economy. If it is worth it to run miners, they run miners. If it isn't, they don't run miners. You can't just extrapolate non correlated data forever.
If you are measuring "energy efficiency" (hence denoting the *type of efficiency* we are talking about here), then sure, tx for tx bitcoin is not very energy efficient at all... I don't see the problem with that... That was never the goal. The goal is again, the exodus from the current centralized system. It does that quite well. It is massively efficient in doing what it was designed to do.


Well, in Nazi Germany they didn't need POW either. Once again, apples to oranges and you are missing the point.


Because it isn't a fair comparison. Because it doesn't carry the same value... EcoCoin does not do what bitcoin does. Thinking beyond being a PayPal 2.0... It goes well beyond that...


No problem. And I don't need for you to give me a reason to tell you to fuck yourself... Again, *I can do what I want*.


Who's splitting hairs now? Energy consumption FUD over and over just because you *just love mining*... I'm making justified assumptions here to carry on conversation. Again, fuck yourself. See how that doesn't need to be invited?


So then what is the point of this conversation again? All you have done is spout unsubstantiated FUD. Bitcoin is not "designed to be inefficient". I have shown that conclusively at this point. All what you are calling "inefficient" (clearly you are referring to energy inefficiency, ie waste) is not actually waste... It is converted into economic incentive that is extremely useful. And its what has allowed the network to remain functional with over over $.25T in value represented on it so far. If you can't see that, once again, I'm sorry, I can't help you. Some people are just born dumb...

It also had large block rewards.
Do you want a fixed limit? Because you can't have both.
Edit: Also the price was &lt;10x what it was today, so if you are pricing your fees in USD, stop because it isn't consistent unless you are applying current prices to previous fees. Even at 1 satoshi per byte, fees would still be $.02 at the minimum for any transaction. This only increases as price increases.

As if no one could have seen a chain, that explicitly didn't fix transaction malleability bug that allows for all this innovation to happen, wouldn't have such innovation on it.
Bcash has always been, from the very beginning, a miner hold out from inevitable L2 scaling. Since there's plenty of new faces around, [here's]( a thread translating a post from Jihan Wu, the CEO of BitMain, controller of AntPool, the largest pool in the world and owner of AntMiner, the defacto monopoly holder on consumer level mining hardware, outright explaining that the reason SegWit was being delayed was because it was going to move transactions off chain. He knew this was inevitable, but if he has the power to delay and get rich off of it, I don't blame him.
Somewhere along the line, Ver and others that I'm not quite convinced whether they have mal-intentions, or are just plain retarded, jumped onto the bandwagon and supported a split from "Core", literally the only development group that has gotten us to where we are today. And if non of that is convincing enough, they threw in the EDA as a cherry on top so that miners could game the system and they could lure mining power to their chain and cripple the main chain.
So, I don't really feel sorry, other than the poor fools who are prone to propaganda and conspiracy theories, because this was an obvious intention from the get-go.

There's such a thing as private insurance and banks would offer high interest rates for deposits. 
Plus, there's really no need to store bitcoin with a bank unless you want the interest. That's a risk you take in exchange for the interest. 
And I don't think higher priced credit is a bad thing. We have a credit problem as it is. With bitcoin however you can rest assured you are being lent value that actually exists in its whole form, unlike fractional reserves.

1) buy in while everyone else is selling, at a bargain, before it actually rises again (hence buy low, sell high rather than what they public does, buy high, sell low)
2) You can short the futures contracts. In other words, you can borrow and sell the contracts at their current price, and buy them back at a lower and return them, keeping the difference. A contract to be able to buy btc at $20K isn't very useful if the price is $5000... so the contract itself will be worth a lot less money.

So we are in a short term hype bubble. Did you see the chart for 2015? As liquidity increases, volatility will decrease. In 25 years, do you still think we have 25% daily swings?
It's funny, all the negative talk comes out during the bubbles, but there's 8 years of solid development in between the bubbles. That development doesn't stop. 2014 was the greatest year for bitcoin in terms of BIPs. 
Eventually, the talk that "anything above $0 is a bubble" will fall on deaf ears. By the time the next speculative run up comes along, there will be people buying who are younger than bitcoin... Is it really a "bubble" at that point? What do you think they will think? Does it matter if it's a "bubble" if it lasts longer than you are alive?
I'll make a bet with you, because I'm already far ahead in my investment. Every day that bitcoin is above $1, you pay me $1. And the day it drops below $1, I will give you all the money you paid me over that time and then double it. Would you be willing to take that bet? It's easy money if bitcoin really is worth $0. 
Or could it be possible that bitcoin is worth more than $0? Could it be possible that there actually is an intrinsic need for programmable money? That cannot be manipulated by a central authority? Is that such a ridiculous concept?

BTG isn't trying to be bitcoin. It is an altcoin just like bcash. If the bitcoin main chain was stalled because of miner collusion, the entire network effect and those with money on the chain would clearly support a POWC. If you don't believe that, I'm sorry, again, you can't fix stupid.


Are you really that ignorant? Ethereum has no ASICs and is chugging along just fine. The only thing an ASIC does is makes hashing more efficient. The cryptography and consensus rules are what secure bitcoin, not hashing. Hashing simply adds economic incentive not to cheat.
Again, you clearly demonstrate very little understanding of how the eco system works, and are clearly a bcash shill trying to pretend to be against it by using the term "bcash". Bcash is a joke. Its not even a blip on the radar of bitcoin now that EDA is finished with.

Cold storage is meant for long term storage. If you plan on trading daily I would recommend you keep the trading capital on the exchange. 
The being said unless you have experience day trading, you should not be buying and selling very often at all. Far too many beginners get caught in this game thinking it's a short term play and it's not. If it drops by 25% in a day, by the time that dip has already hit 3% you are too late. Day traders know when the dips are going to be, or at least have indicators that tell them it is possible. You as an average person will get eaten alive. 
So that being said, move the coins off Coinbase, onto a hardware wallet, and enjoy the rollercoaster ride, and maybe think about selling some in a year or two. 
If you want to spend it, keep a small amount on a phone wallet that gives you a recovery 12 word seed. If you aren't given 12 words, then you really don't actually have any bitcoin. With Coinbase, you don't have bitcoin.

In what world do you live in where there is 0% returns for 30 years?
The S&amp;P 500 is at ~2675 today and was at ~290 in 1987 (30 years ago)...
ln(2675/290)/30years = ~7.4% return compounded continuously for 30 years, which sounds about right.
So if we take 30K per year, add 30K per year, compounded daily for 30 years at 7.4% rate, we get around $3.6M... That's assuming a constant growth and constant buyins without regard to timing at all...
If he has worked in tech since 1987 we can assume he probably made some money in the dot com, and with 10 years of industrial experience, and the financial brain to know to save, he probably reallocated at least part of the way up the bubble and saved some money. Then, when the bubble popped, he probably saw a great buying opportunity when other investors were selling because in the end the internet fundamentals never changed, the hype just disappeared.
Whether or not he saw the housing bubble or not, who knows, but anyone who had cash in 2009-2010 and invested it has made substantial returns since because the US economy isn't going away.
All in all, enter some basic understanding of markets and proper timing and its easily possible to make up the missing 400K to get to 4M.
And ~30K per year really isn't that much for someone in the technology field who has a nack for saving. In most jobs, thats less than 1/3, maybe even 1/4 of the salary.
Edit: 


No, you don't need "a couple hundred grand" to save $40K per year. Just realistic lifestyle conditions and not trying to live with the Joneses.
[Here's]( an article explaining the amount needed to live "comfortably" in major cities, and it gets much cheaper if you live in the suburbs of those cities. Notice, those figures also account for 20% savings. Remove the 20% savings, and take a salary of 80-90K (typical minimum for tech related work) and subtract the living difference and you can easily hit $40K per year minimum.

Do you realize that a reserve currency simply settles cross nation states? The number of transactions is exceedingly low. 
Bitcoin would be like gold bullion is for reserves. How often is gold actually used in a transaction. 
Layer 2 technologies will be viable within a decade's time and will allow for a daily use currency layer to be built on top, and it will had a defacto "gold standard" to it. 
But there is nothing stopping bitcoin from being the universal understanding of value that all other national currencies are pegged against. In fact, being that the supply can't be manipulated, it's a far better option than anything else available. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:54:40
No, your backhand calculation does not beat the actual data being presented. 
The average bitcoin block is overwhelmingly closer to 10 minutes than it is to 7. Sorry, but the numbers don't change. 
Edit, in fact, using that equation solving for block time to this point, you get 9.42 minutes per block average which is far closer to 10 minutes than 7, and if you look at the data, the standard deviation of block times drops drastically after the introduction of data. In fact, block times are far more predictably closer to 10 minutes with ASICs than without, and we can assume that 9.42 minutes will get closer to 10 over time. 
So sorry, but I win. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:28:25


Ummm. Cool?


Well like I said the premise of the question to begin with was stupid. We won't be transacting on the blockchain directly. It isn't feasible. That was the first response to satoshi, it rings true now, and is literally mathematically provable to not be feasible in the future. Sorry, I'm not running around like the roof is on fire because I made $35 cell phone calls before, and paid multiple hundred dollar dial up bills. 


And that's fine. But that wasn't sustainable from the beginning, and it isn't sustainable now. That was no secret. We simply came to that realization. 


No, no, *NO*. Rarely if ever is it appropriate to use the average especially if the median is available, especially with something with such outliers. If I decide to pay a $1M fee, how at all does that affect your ability to send a transaction for $5? On your average model it would affect it drastically. The fact that as a computer scientist you don't understand basic data analysis is alarming. 
And like I said, really, the minimum fee is what you should be concerned about, because a transaction in a block is in a block. Any extra fee above the minimum represents waste. 


It's temporary. Good thing cell phones were only for rich people right? Those $.50 per minute calls would never work their way to poor people. 


This has nothing to do with "us vs them" it is literally unsubstantiated FUD and twisting facts to make it look like there's a problem where there is non. Meanwhile, bitcoin chugs along. You may not send a transaction, but you can bet someone else is sending one in your place. We don't need you. Sorry, bitcoin isn't a charity. It never was. 


Lololol hence why I don't believe you were here in 2013. I've been around the block a few times. Feel free to go through my posts. The fact that you think bitcoin on chain is viable tells me, *you* don't actually give a shit to understand the fundamentals.

Everyone agrees, with a relative degree of certainty. For very confined blocks, this is fine, but there's absolutely nothing to stop the chain from being replaced by a longer chain with different POW potentially changing all of those blocks with an arbitrary distance back. 
The only way to deal immutably is to refer to the hash, the block height is more informal to the actual state of the chain, not the chain itself.

@_date: 2017-12-18 03:17:20
You are correct. Use your transaction hash then. The point is, its an irrelevant question, so I gave an irrelevant answer.
And I downvoted your FUD about $30 transactions. Even the upper end of transactions today were $18, and that's for first block range. I've snuck $2 transactions in in less than 72 hours. Pricing fees in USD is dishonest anyways, because they are priced in bitcoin inherently, of which the USD price is up 20X this year. So your "$30" transaction would have cost $1.50 in its exact same format, for the exact same amount of satoshis at the beginning of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:40:53
If you've been around since 2014 (which I doubt), you would know that the average transaction fee is a terrible way of measuring the transaction fee because prediction algorithms are fucking terrible. Not to mention, your $27.20 is still 10% off of your $30 figure.
[Median transaction fee for that same time frame is around $15.](
But keep trying to push your FUD. You're not gonna go very far apparently.
Edit: Also, realistically, we should be looking at minimum transaction fee, because it doesn't matter if you pay $1 or $100, if you are in the block it clears just the same. I don't have those metrics though, other than looking at the mempool graph.

No efficient in terms of speed and cost... yet. Sure I agree.


No, it isn't. In fact, its designed to be the most efficient and secure decentralized settlement platform on the planet. It does that quite nicely. You seem to think that a centralized settlement platform and a decentralized settlement one are the same thing. Apples to oranges.


Because it doesn't. It means it consumes ample amount of resources, which are converted into proof of work, and thus security for the network through aligning of economic incentives. That's very valuable if it means we don't need to trust a central authority. Its not wasteful at all. If you can't see that, then you are the idiot.


No the system is literally defined to increase the amount of economic incentive to act in a proper manner, rather than a malicious manner. As value increases, increased security is needed. And yes, I don't know why you think something literally 144x than the best case scenario of its competition is inefficient. Once again, "you're an idiot."


144x faster than 24 hours is not slow. Not sure what you are on about...


It is very efficient for the task of settling on payments across the planet trustlessly in a decentralized, censorship resistant and permissionless manner. 10 minutes for the world to come to agreement on the state of all commerce... That's blistering fast compared to other settlement networks...
If you are comparing it to cash/visa, I would say that the Lightning network is almost complete, and is even faster. Hence why I say *yet* when compared to a cash system.


You're going to have to cite other competing methods that do the same thing...

Yes and in this case, bitcoin is the good money, and all state money is bad money... I'm confused what your problem with that statement is? In fact, it already has happened in numerous locations across the world. With our debt/deficit spending, its only a matter of time until prices start rising here... Inflation has already been happening... Interest rates have been at 0 for 7 years... That has consequences... When buying power starts to slip on the USD, what makes you think that people won't jump to bitcoin?


Money doesn't have to be backed by anything, it just needs to have a controlled supply. Even gold isn't "backed" by anything. Its industrial use cases are minimal, and the majority is used for jewelry as a show of wealth. That wealth isn't backed by anything except our perception that gold is valuable.


There's a big difference between "money" and a "payment method". A payment method is a way of transferring what the underlying asset is. Bitcoin the protocol (uppercase B), is a way of transferring its internal asset (lowercase b).


The barriers to entry argument or "bitcoin 2.0" argument is stupid in my opinion. Why haven't other coins overtake bitcoin yet if that was the case? Its because the exact same thing that happened to gold has now happened to bitcoin in the crypto currency space. Sure other coins may have some value, but they *aren't* bitcoin, the one coin that won't ever disappear. There will only ever be 21M *actual bitcoins*. No matter how many forks you make, clones you make, tokens you make, you can't affect that underlying value set. It exists and can't be changed without going through the proper protocol rules. Not to mention, anything that wishes to compete must also be open source. What's to stop bitcoin from stealing better code? I would argue the reason we haven't stolen any code is because no other code has proved to *actually* be better. Ethereum was so much better at scale until it wasn't. We are stealing Monero's confidentiality methods. Litecoin is mostly dumb because there's downsides to a reduced block size which will be realized later when it comes time for them to scale. Bcash... Don't even get me started lol. None of these show any real threat to taking over bitcoin as the premier store of value.


The USD could also drop 25% permanently. In fact, in the 70's it lost 2/3 of its value. It has never regained that back. I don't see what your point here is.

The price rising does not necessarily mean there's hundreds of millions of dollars being poured in... the price at any exchange is simply the last price it was sold at. You can move the price slightly up or down by buying less than $.01 at the ask or bid price. 
Also, what reserves? Bitcoin was created for the specific avoidance of Fractional Reserve Lending, where banks lend out 10x the amount of their reserves, expecting the returns from most loans to return more than the failures of others. The federal reserve is there to print money from thin air (it's not federal and there are no reserves) to balance the books if there's ever a run on the banks or massive collapse of credit like there was in 2008.
With bitcoin, bank runs become very possible again, but the losses are localized and there's no socialized losses like there are with our current system.

My power company offers the ability to go on an "electric vehicle plan" which offers lower prices on non peak hours, and I have thought about mining and doing exactly this, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were doing this in at least some capacity. I know the miners need to be cleaned for dust frequently.

You must be joking. Bitcoin is doing exactly what it was designed to do because of the free market. 
There's block space for those who value it, which is exactly what is supposed to happen. There's no shortages in a free market. Just because *you* may not value a $50 transaction doesn't mean others may not. It just means they don't have to be inconvenienced by your bullshit coffee transaction and wait in line. 
Just because you can't mine effectively doesn't mean there's a problem with bitcoin. There's literally devices now that utilize energy to its maximum potential in security of the network. The free market brought us that. The capex the investors have spent on ASICs ensures that their economic incentives are aligned with the network. 
There's absolutely nothing wrong with bitcoin at the moment. Bitcoin isn't, and never was a charity.

We have yet to see the effects of a deflationary currency that can be broken into infinitely smaller parts. The problem with classical deflation is that a penny could buy a car, so why spend it on a piece of bread. Bitcoin doesn't have that problem. Tell me, would the system be any different if there was a single bitcoin, and everyone had a fraction of it? Would it still not work?


First off, your global warming statistic is bullshit. [***97%*** of scientists believe that the humans have an affect on the climate]( Agreement on how much of an affect is still highly debated. But if I take an acrylic box of O2 and an acrylic box of CO2 and put them out in the sun, obviously the CO2 box will get warmer because it has more mass and thus more electrons to absorb the energy. But whether or not "climate change" has catastrophic consequences is not near as obvious.
Secondly, economics is a social science and hard sciences don't apply near as well. Economics models bank highly on the assumption that "people act rationally" which is a very large and bullshit assumption to make. Mainstream economics believes that QE is a good idea, yet fucking with the monetary supply has caused literally each and every bubble we have ever had. Most economists really can't predict shit, so giving them the same weight as scientists who *can* predict things is fucking stupid.

You realize we are 8 years in right? If its a "bubble" for longer than you and I are alive, does it really matter if it is a bubble or not?

Bubbles have triggering events, but the mania that fuels them is pure greed, which reverses when they are losing money rather than making money. 
Bitcoin's fundamentals have not changed. But in the short term, it is not even being used as a store of value. It is being used as a vehicle to quick wealth. That never lasts.

I'm saying that people who call it a "bubble" and say it "will pop soon" without giving an actual expiration date to their claims when they can be wrong are just fools. To them, any value over $0 is "a bubble" because its not "backed by anything". But the reality is, value is dictated by the demand something has, and there's no denying the demand for an noncounterfeitable asset, that can't be seized easily, with programable transaction features in it, with a provable limited supply that is governed by consensus rules of the market constituents, not any central authority.
So if they want to define that as a "bubble" then they should also define gold and fiat as "bubbles" but in the end it doesn't matter because we will all be dead before any of them fully collapse to $0 value.

You're right, derivatives exchanging is far more like a "winner take all" type scenario... CME is far and beyond the rest of the derivative exchanges overall, and particular markets are specific to particular exchanges. For example, if CME wins over the bitcoin market, volume for bitcoin futures on any other exchange are going to be far far less.

The fun is that when you earn value, you can independently verify that it is worth all of that value, and not [10% of a portion of the value that is effectively simply an IOU on work in the form of taxed income of future work through the use of fractional reserve lending from $8T of federal stimulus money created with the flick of a pen.](
The fun is exiting this Keynesian nightmare that has gripped our country for almost 100 years creating drastic wealth inequality, and moving back to actual free market capitalism, where those who make contributions to society's wealth are rewarded, and those who act foolishly and destroy wealth are punished.

So you don't need a roof over your head? You don't need food and water? You don't need transportation? You claim to need a computer, do you not need money for that? All of those things require cash to acquire, thus is a pretty damn good incentive to invest in a cash generating asset, even if your money increases in value as well. In your model, negative interest rates should be prominent. No saving allowed whatsoever. 


No it doesn't. The time value of money simply says that money has some opportunity cost if it isn't used elsewhere. If I have an opportunity to return 7% in the stock market, or get 1% return from savings, then there's a net time value of money difference of 6% in those situations. But "time value of money" depends entirely on your discount rate which depends entirely on your boundary conditions. There's no magical force there, it's simply a measure of opportunity cost. 


Clearly you've never done a net present value calculation. It's in fact very simple to find whether an investment is viable or not. If your money is growing at 1% sitting still or 10% through investment, you're an idiot to keep the 1% return. 


Really? Money is the communication of value. Tell me, what value is being created by printing money out of thin air. It's backed by a debt, which is the promise of literally *an iou*. Clearly you don't understand what money is. Tell me, why do we have M1,M2 and M3 if all money is created equal?


You are correct it's just like the gold standard. That's the point. Having money actually being worth something. 


Credit expansion is literally the problem. You are a fool to not understand that. Look at the interest rates immediately preceding any recession. And how do we solve it? We simply add more credit. That isn't sustainable, that's socialism through socialized losses. And you are fundamentally missing the point... *We want to return to the gold standard* (now the bitcoin standard). 


It's quite ignorant to say it does actually. What are interest rates right now compared to the rest of history? What happens when the stock market corrects? We go negative? Talk about not understanding the time value of money, you are literally penalizing saving.  


�� sure mines bigger than your's and you clearly don't understand science *or economics* apparently. 


You aren't skeptical of models that can't accurately predict, but you know science. I buy that. 


Correct. That's literally how it works. It's either correct or incorrect. They can provide useful insight, but that doesn't make them right. For example, Newtonian physics breaks down a planetary sizes and the speed of light. *Newton was wrong* as evidenced by GPS systems that would break down on Newtonian physics. Does that make the entire field useless? No because it happens to predict some things (local to earth physics) quite well. But to look at it like some absolute truth is just foolish. 


Ok, well I don't know how to address stupidity like that. 


Yes, yes it does actually. Thats pretty much a universal fact that increased liquidity leads to lower volatility.

No, 1 year is a very long time in the midst of a hype bubble. Maybe you weren't here in 2013, but it was exactly the same. Shitcoins everywhere, premines were all the rage, everyone's idea was *so much better* than bitcoin was going to be the Facebook to Bitcoin's MySpace. All of this was happening at breakneck speed, within a year. 
Then the bubble popped.
Most people neglected it all. They got burned, they figured the news was right, it must have all been a scam, how could they have been so stupid to fall for it. 
But some of us stayed around. Development surely didn't stop. Over 2014-2015, mnemonic seeds became a reality, hardware wallets became a reality, Segwit was postulated, confidential transactions were postulated, sidechains were postulated, Schnorr sigs were postulated, Lightning network was at least brewing in people's heads. Iirc, 2014 was the worst year in terms of price and the best year in terms of development (by BIPs). 
So if you are realizing that bitcoin costs more than it should for what it does, you are probably right. But after this hype bubble pops and everyone claims it to be dead and moves on development doesn't stop. Feel free to stick around, it's the most productive conversation. 
And no, the money won't flood to other coins. Other coins sacrificed things in order to do what they want to do today, and those sacrifices will show at scale. Ethereum was so much better with scale until it wasn't. Can they do 10x our volume? Sure... but try looking at their on chain scaling problem and tell me how you solve that. In the end, it doesn't matter what you can do in the short term if you set yourself up for failure long term. And everyone is failing until they can complete with centralized networks. 
So no, 1 year isn't shit in this space. This is still software development and it still takes time. All the hype in the world won't change that. It took us 8 years to get where we are today, what makes you think we now only have less than a year to get to the finish line? Bitcoin was here 8 years ago, and will be here 8 years in the future. The same can't necessarily be said about any other shitcoin.

If you have coins, and you stored them in the wallet on your computer and you have the file, then fairly high (unless you had poor security practices and they've been stolen). 
There are no actual "bitcoins" just private keys that can sign for outputs of other transactions, with the base transaction being the mining reward they were born in. So your wallet is effectively a "treasure map". It's basically practically impossible from a math standpoint to guess the keys. If they are in the file, then your coins are still there as long as no one got the keys through hacking your computer. 
If the file is corrupt, there's still a very slight possibility, because there's likely some uniformity to the data and it may be worth talking to a data recovery professional about filling in the missing bytes. 
If the wallet.dat file opens fine and there's no coins, you can check your addresses on an explorer and see if they were ever used and maybe get more leads. If none of the addresses were ever used, you either ever had any coins or you didn't store them there.

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:13:07


My original claim is that the ***activity of efficient allocation of RESOURCES is a wealth generating ACTION***. Bitcoin is not efficient matter of moving money quickly yet, however it is a very useful tool for storing money long term, out of the hands of anyone else, with programmable encumbrance, and has the very real potential to be much more efficient in terms of speed and transaction costs in the future. There is demand for it for all of those reasons. ***The efficient allocation of the bitcoins themselves to those who want them*** is the wealth generating action. I don't understand how you are conflating the two.


Yes, the network is set to have a consensus time of 10 minutes for the worldwide settlement of transactions. This is not some new concept. ACH settles every 24 hours in the best case scenario, in other words, 144x slower. Other coins tweak this variable downwards, however it is a net zero game.


No, they are intentionally designed to be computationally intensive, and thus require resources to be consumed as an economic bond to the network. Its actually quite an efficient way to identify good actors from bad actors in a system where anyone can modify the protocol. All I have to do is run a single SHA256 hash on an incoming block to determine whether the actor is malicious or not. There's not much more efficient than that actually.


Yes, people are economically incentivized to be a good actor rather than a bad actor. If you haven't realized, that's what makes this entire system work. Its not wasted at all. It aligns economic incentives. So, yes, you clearly read some pretty substantial FUD on the internet if you are against mining.

Well the first transaction anyone can find was for 2 pizzas. 
Shortly after that, it really got its bootstrap as most technologies do, by being used for criminal activities. Silk Road really gave it its proof of concept as a transactional medium where people could reliably accept it and either use it to buy other things on the Silk Road (more supply for example), or go to an exchange and trade it out for some fiat money. There were hundreds of billions of $ worth of transactions on the Silk Road, and it really connected the idea of bitcoin being a transactional protocol, and real commerce happening stick. It became an understood unit of value that could be transacted with ease, which is really the fundamental building block of any sort of money. 
After the Silk Road was brought down, more people heard of it and speculated with it in exchanges and it became a daytrading vehicle. The speculation combined with Mt Gox problems lead to a pop in 2014 when bitcoin "died". However, people still developed behind the scenes and more work was done between 2014 and 2017, and as more and more hype has been built around it, there's not more infrastructure to support more users easily, and it has become a FOMO/SOV play. Whether this bubble will come to an end or be dwarfed as institutional money comes rushing in before it can pop remains unknown.

Miners simply offer blocks. Your node (or the node you are using to access the network) either accepts the block or doesn't. Plain and simple. Miners don't want to waste resources on blocks that aren't accepted. 
So running a node, or knowing the source of where your SPV wallet is connecting is important in that it dictates what consensus rules you are running and thus what chain you are following. 
The "hash power is king" argument is stupid, and is brought from the idea of BIP9 that was simply intended to ensure that the majority of the hash power was coordinated to prevent an accidental fork. It turned into a political play with the miners holding the chain hostage for fees. At the threat of a UASF (regular nodes denying blocks that don't meet our consensus), the NYA was proposed and miners activated Segwit using the NYA as a scapegoat. The event did let us know that miners can't be trusted to implement changes, so BIP9 will never be used again. So with that said, hash power really means all of nothing. 
Worse comes to worse, we could HF with a completely different POW, render the current miners useless, and everyone carries on like normal. Hash power simply discourages misbehaving but if they are already misbehaving, it is failed and no longer serves its purpose. In reality "network effect is king", and the hash power will follow the most profitable coin, which is the one with the network effect giving it value. 
In the end, the only thing giving bitcoin value is the fact that it *is bitcoin*, ***the bitcoin*** that everyone has heard about for years. That's why the Bcash clan is so set on stealing the name, because it is the name (and the history that goes along with it), that is what gives this particular ledger value.

You are correct, I work directly in this industry and am not at all concerned, and by your limited understanding and lack of credible sources I grasp that you are simply a "concerned civilian", which is fine, but quite honestly you are wasting your time. 
The union of concerned scientists is a lobbied group made up of 15,000 loosely defined "scientists". By their definition, I qualify as a "scientist" which I can tell you, I am not. 
The bottom line is, while it is decidably unanimous that we have "some" effect on the environment, very little evidence is available to show how much. The numerical models are just like any numerical models, and depend drastically on boundary conditions, and with collecting evidence for less than 100 years, it simply isn't feasible to give a real result, as evidenced by the change in rhetoric from "global warming" to "climate change"... their model was substantially wrong at predicting (a fundamental requirement for any scientific evidence) so they changed the narrative. 
And the final nail in the coffin for this discussion is the simply that if we *are* catastrophically affecting the earth, solar and wind and bitcoin are drops in the overall bucket. Nuclear is the only real savior at this point (if it is in fact catastrophic) with or without bitcoin in discussion. If you truly want to save the world, you should be a major proponent of nuclear and the deregulations that would allow for it to be viable once again (deregulating to the point that it is on par with the rest of the world's regulations). If that is the case, and there's a major overhaul to nuclear for the sake of the planet, this entire discussion is moot. You throw around the 32 Terrawatt hour fear mongering article as if it means anything, however it is less than 1% of the energy consumption of the US alone.

"Almost failed"
"It barely survived the bcash attack"
Get your FUD out of here. A hash rate attack is as simple as a POWC to fix. Bitcoin hasn't even flinched though. Bcash thinks they are seriously affecting bitcoin, but they aren't even close. Manipulated price, hardly accepted anywhere, not even 10% of the hash rate, and hardly any of the forked coins have moved. 
The market cap for Bcash is fraudulent and assumes its price onto coins that have never existed as a new Bcash UTXO, and won't ever be.

No, mining is simply grouping transactions into blocks every ~10 minutes. Those blocks have to follow specific rules set by everyone watching... One of those rules is every 210000 blocks, the mining reward must be cut in half. It is currently 12.5 BTC. It was 50, then 25. In a few years it will be 6.25. Eventually, around 2140, it will reach 0.
Any miner is free to deviate from this rule in their block. However, I, along with anyone else following the bitcoin network simply ignores their block because it doesn't follow our rules. They are on their own chain at that point.
It is the combined playing by the rules that gives bitcoin value. If you spend the money to mine the block, you may as well play by the rules.

No, but it is a realistic 5-10 year strategy, in which you can move your savings average even higher...


No, it isn't. I live in a shithole apartment with 2 other guys in their mid to late 20s, we all make $90K+, and we all live off maybe 20-30K per year. Its just not that hard. Most of us started at around $70K as well. That's pretty normal now days. When I was on sites (in the backwoods), with per diem and overtime, I could clear $120K easily. A lot of blue collar workers can do this regularly, most of them blow it on stupid shit.


This is patently false. Its actually easier to find a higher paying job out in the suburbs because they need to attract younger talent. Most tech related jobs, especially in areas like the suburbs of Atlanta can clear $100K within 3 years of experience.
 &gt; You linked to an article about living in the suburbs, so what does that commute look like? Would I be on the road for two hours every day? Yikes.
So you don't want to make sacrifices... That's a decision for *you* to make. To most people, an hour long commute each way isn't very much to ask at all.


Correct, but most people are just fucking stupid and throw money away to keep up with their neighbors. Most people don't buy houses anymore they just rent from their banks. They don't plan on paying it off before leaving. Keeping a car for 10 years? Unheard of now days. Going on trips is once again, a decision you make, why is it now someone else's fault that they would rather save that money to indulge with later?


Sorry you can't do it, but I, and every other non financially retarded one of my peers is easily saving $30-40K per year... In fact, I try and target at least $1K per week if I can. Live like you are poor now, reap the benefits later. There's no reason for me, as a mid 20 year old, to be blowing more than half of my salary...
Not to mention, we haven't even touched on the idea of saving earnings before income taxes. Maxing out 401K and roth IRA is fairly normal for anyone looking to save. There's around $23K right there.

No, inflation is an increase in prices, and is a symptom of decreased buying power because of an increased supply of money. The $8T stimulus package went right to the stock market and prices grew, however no productivity grew. 
"Inflation" in terms of the CPI (which is a terrible way to measure it since they decided to remove crucial items and make it an arbitrary index of items) has not increased yet because that money has no left the stock market yet. When it does, prepare for consumer prices to inflate as well.

Each layer represents a new fee category. At times of low volume, you see the sharp drops down and it cuts into that group. Many miners will include transactions the oldest transactions in a layer first, so while there may be a lot of low fee transactions, with patience you will get in.

Bcash isn't sustainable. Use it short term sure, but Core is trying to build the financial platform for the future and there's plenty of work required for that. 
The very first response to the Whitepaper was that it wouldn't scale. They were having the same discussions 8 years ago that we are having today. It will scale, but it won't be on chain. 
In reality if you just want a blockchain platform without high volume, why not use something like Litecoin that fixed a blatant bug (transaction malleability)? The entire reason Bcash exists is because of transaction malleability. It's a miner coin.

You can not say that it works at scale theoretically or practically. There is literally no proof of it at all.


[I actually have plenty of reason.]( *You* have no reason to believe that it *will* work, because again, it has serious flaws that it has yet to prove it can overcome.


And it was not proven that POW could handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per day. Now we have proven it can through *actually doing it*. You don't get to just extrapolate that to your shitcoins. You actually have to do it.


Once again, unsubstantiated and in my opinion, bullshit. The only proven way to date is Proof of Work. Otherwise, you are simply operating in a trusted environment, which is literally exactly the opposite of the Byzantine General's problem. With POS, you are literally banking on the fact that someone is going to act altruistically based off the idea that they have something at stake that they don't want to lose.

Jesus...still moving those posts. So can establish that $70K is a normal starting position salary in tech? Does that or does that not classify as a "good job" in your opinion? Not that it matters, considering you are working against your point if you say it doesn't classify (meaning that even people *without* "good jobs" can save that much).


Once again, coming from the guy who clearly doesn't even understand compounding interest, this isn't surprising this needs to be explained, but the money added at the beginning accrues far more over time than the money added at the end. So you can set your goal for say $1M, and after 10 years of $40K per year savings, dial it back substantially and still be on target.
The more and more we go on with this conversation, the more and more I'm starting to believe you are one of the poor fucks who thought SS would be there for him the whole time, and has less than $100K in savings and is &lt;10 years out from retiring. Should have taken a basic finance class man.

The testnet is the exact same code as main net bitcoin (sometimes they will implement future/beta features but Segwit ended up getting its own testnet chain iirc), and it is discouraged from mining with anything more than a CPU, making it easy to get coins and effectively making them worthless, so there's no risk when writing test code. There's faucets everywhere, with a reasonably fast computer you can mine it and get a full block reward, and if you are really lazy, you can probably go pop into a dev slack and ask for a coin or two and someone will send you one. They are so worthless in fact, that if it becomes too hard to mine, the entire chain will be wiped out and reset if difficulty ever gets too high.

Solar is cute, and a fun way to run some household appliances.

The US govt has made it very very clear they have no intentions of paying back their debts, in fact they borrow more just to pay the interest on the debts, inflating the currency into oblivion. 
If you are trusting a currency because it is backed by the ability for a country to pay back its debts, but it hasn't done so for 20 years and shows no intentions to do so, the currency is effectively in freefall. Whether it is bitcoin or gold or oil or some other asset, holding onto anything but the USD is advisable.

And there we go... Myspace does not at all mirror this situation. One required absolutely no extra effort on the user side to make a simultaneous profile on Facebook. Effort was entirely asymmetric. Removing the idea of something having value however, is very tough. Shit, when was the last time a gold shilling was spent anywhere, and look at the valuation it gets.


This is still an entirely relevant point imo. All money is floating evaluations. Hell even the GBP floats in relation to the USD. All you are saying is that it acts more like a currency than most people are saying it does. The only difference is Bitcoin's 25% variations are usually in the upwards direction. In fact, iirc there's less than 10 times in it's history that it has ever fallen more than 25%. People don't seem to get too mad when their money increases by 25%.

Bitcoin has pretty much all of the innovation from what I have seen. With Bitcoin's scale, any and all other blockchains would have just as bad of problems if not worse.
There's quite a lot of stuff in development but it takes time. I think we will see a bust to this speculative bubble we entered this past month or so, and things will get quite for a few more months, but once these developments start coming to a head again, it will blow other coins out of the water. I'm not concerned about short term valuations.

Not necessarily. Power plants want to run at the highest capacity possible at all times, but don't want to run over...
They typically have "peaker" units, which are very inefficient gas turbines that can be started up very quickly and run temporarily in order to cover any over capacity issues. They typically run at a loss at these times.
On the contrary, at night time, electricity usage plummets and they typically reduce the amount of fuel used. But if the plant isn't making electricity they aren't making money. Sometimes even running too low can be running at a loss because of overhead.
I gave the usage schedule as an example of the fact that there are varying times for electricity usage. It is very possible that the Chinese mines have contracts with the electrical companies that promise them very low rates at night time, and in turn the mining facilities have miners that are cycled on and off for the night time only, or they rotate and allow for maintenance of the hardware.
The point is, electricity is a very time/usage centric thing and it can be profitable one minute and not profitable the next.

If you are sending the money to yourself, and don't need them anytime soon, don't worry about it. Transactions are either confirmed or unconfirmed. The money can't disappear, it will just not appear accessible to some wallet softwares. But the UTXOs aren't spent until it gets in a block so worse comes to worse you could just send a doublespend with the same UTXOs. 
Tl dr; relax. Been there before, I know it sucks, but it's literally impossible for th coins to be locked forever. Now when sending to myself I use like 5-10 sat/byte because I don't need the coins any time soon and it's a lot cheaper.

Iirc it was decided at 21M because of a computer science reason having to do with float points. 
The amount of coins really doesn't matter. The whole lot of coins can be seen as the mathematical set of all value represented by bitcoin, and 1BTC is 1/21e4 % of all of that value. This carries proportionately down to the satoshi level and even further if we so desire later. 
Realistically a very large portion of mined coins are lost, and prices are a reflection of money supply in circulation, so even those in cold storage won't be counted into the available supply. People spending cold storage coins will result in a slight increase in supply and thus decrease in buying power, and vice versa for saving. Realistically, this will be a fairly self balanced system with prices dropping overtime with production.

The "1000" people statistic is 100% bullshit.
Addresses != People
Coinbase has Millions of bitcoins under its control, but they also belong to millions of people. However for fee and security reasons, they keep them all in a few hundred addresses. But coinbase "owns" none of them.
On the flip side, wallet softwares will generate a new receiving address for each transaction, meaning I have at least a few hundred in my control, of which they may have nothing anymore, or anywhere between $1 to a couple thousand $. But I own all of them.
The fact of the matter is, its impossible to look at addresses and amounts and claim to know who owns what.

Coal is being phased out pretty much everywhere and LNG is the new coal, having half as much carbon output. Nuclear isn't viable at the moment because of the absurd regulations required in nuclear construction. Vogtle 3&amp;4 currently at the brink of being abandoned due to budget overruns, The sister plant in SC was just shut down (can't remember the name), and Westinghouse declared bankruptcy a few months back. Solar and Wind proponents (also the biggest lobbyist to groups against nuclear and for climate change research) have made nuclear not cost viable. If someone gets a paper cut at a nuclear plant, everyone stops working for at least an hour to have a safety meeting on how to carry paper properly. This isn't exaggeration. This literally happened to me 8 months ago. 
When/if we ever get to the brink where climate change is a large enough issue (despite the media frenzy, it isn't yet), nuclear is the only large scale viable option for green energy, regulations will be loosened, and it will come to fruition again. Solar and wind and hydro can't sustain our energy appetite. Nuclear and super critical combined cycle plants are the only things that can actually scale. Solar and wind look like Bcash in comparison. 


I'm saying the government will eventually come after bitcoin under the guise that it is concerned about the environment. 


Again, I'm in the industry, and I disagree whole heartedly. 


The evidence still remains to be seen just how much we are actually affecting the world climate, and most definitely still out on long term effects. 


We will find a solution when one is *actually needed*. Again, try to shut down bitcoin. It'll be worth the laugh for everyone else.

If another client comes up with a far better implementation to interact with the protocol, and there's more widespread usage, then the protocol changes.
A protocol is a set of instructions. Not a computer program. No one needs any support of "large mining ops". Mining is simply presenting valid blocks to the network. You clearly don't know the first thing about bitcoin.

The first point was not specific to Bitcoin at all. The first point is an economic fact that efficient allocation of resources, ie "trading" is in fact a wealth generating activity. It is not a net neutral game. By acquiring something like bitcoin, that you know will be useful in the future, at a lower cost, and distributing it to those who need/want it at a higher cost, you have done a productive action of acquiring and distributing. If you do both, you are adding liquidity to the market and are a market maker. Bitcoin isn't very useful if you need to be able to convert it to some sort of fiat currency because that's all a certain vendor will accept. By offering liquidity, you are offering something of value. This isn't particular to bitcoin at all

No, you can't. You can threaten to use violence and put people in cages or forcibly collect money fro them for defying your relative rules, but you can't defy free will. Sorry. And btw, banning mining is effectively impossible.


2/3 of Bitmain's mining facilities are powered directly using hydroelectric dams.
And again, I don't think you understand how little amount of electricity it is in the grand scheme of things. That is drops in the bucket compared to the capacity of nuclear energy, as well as China is switching from coal fired power plants to LNG plants, as the US has been doing for the past decade. If you didn't know, Natural Gas burns with literally 50% of the same carbon output as coal.
You are making a really big deal out of something that is effectively a non issue.
I find the socialized loss inducing program of fractional reserve lending, as well as funding of military and welfare states through deficit spending far more of a problem than a small portion of the overall global energy consumption. Its well worth the tradeoff in my opinion.

Energy can actually be priced on a usage schedule incentivizing avoiding peak times and utilizing underused times. If you check with your power company you can probably find a plan with some sort of electric car plan that allows you to charge your car overnight for like 3 cents/kwhr. On the flip side, these contracts usually charge a penalty rate for usage at peak times (basically week days, during the day, during the summer because of AC usage).
Mining doesn't run in a vacuum. If it is not profitable to mine (energy costs are too high), they will turn off the miners.
Ultimately I believe bitcoin mining will finally put us over the brink for nuclear energy, which is really the only thing that can satisfy our energy consumption at a global "green" scale anyways. Once nuclear becomes viable again due to bringing the regulations back down to sane levels, bitcoin becomes even less of a drop in the bucket because the capacity for nuclear is mind blowingly large.

They are all embedded in a particular branch of the Merkel tree. You simply produce the main script hash of the Merkel tree, and then the code to point to your branch (sorry I only know of a high level overview of what MAST does).
Mast basically allows for very very large (basically unlimited) script hash programs to be put into the same size as a single P2SH. 
This is huge in the grand scheme of programmable money. Transaction throughput volume will come in time.

Bitcoin is not Turing complete on purpose. It's not like they didn't know how to do it. They had the forethought that allowing for complex looping would enable many more attack vectors, and create many more vulnerabilities. And it has with Ethereum. The DAO, the parity multisig bug, and many others are all examples of exactly why bitcoin was not designed Turing complete by design. 
And block time is another design choice. It is not like processing clock speed that is just dated. In fact, if the bitcoin block time were to get so fast that it were at 2.5 minutes, it would be *retargeted* to 10 minutes shortly after. To understand block time, ask yourself why we even have one? Why do we retarget it to 10 minutes? Why not 1 minute? What not 1s? Why not 1ms? The answer is that it is the time that is needed for all nodes to come to compete consensus. If block times decrease but orphans increase, it makes no difference because you'll have to wait for more confirmations. What difference does waiting for 1-3 blocks at 10 minutes have vs waiting for 10-30 blocks at one minute? Litecoin and Ethereum are going to have a much harder time scaling their blocksize if they ever need to, because they've decreased the amount of time available to them to sync up around the world. 
In reality, bitcoin has proven to be the most robust system of them all, and has shown to be resilient to many attacks and is exactly what you would expect from something aiming to be digital gold. 
Not to mention Ethereum won't reach levels of inflation of less than the FED's target until about 40 years from now iirc. Not a very good safe haven from fiat.

Do you like money? Because if you can buy something for cheaper than it is worth, you should buy it to sell it again later. If you find a stock with a lower than average PE ratio and everything else about the company checks out, you should very much buy it to then resell it higher. 


There's no obligation, but you are dancing around the question here because you know I have you pinned. If you could buy bitcoin from someone for $1, would you do it? Why is that such a hard question to answer?


Ok, so we are getting somewhere. You value it less than $10. What's the bottom end of that range?




Ok, so I'm not quite sure what all your bullshit above was about, acting as if it's absolutely ludicrous that bitcoin could become a world currency. We've just established it has a non zero value, and it has a transactional layer that works albeit terribly at the moment but hundreds of developers across the globe are working on that exact problem and making serious ground.
So if you have something with fixed supply, a non zero value, and a transactional protocol built in, why is it so impossible for that something to become the replacement money for terribly managed central bank notes?
I'm not at all telling you to invest in bitcoin. I think that's a terrible idea at the moment. In fact I literally just sold off about ~$70K worth, and am thinking about selling the remaining soon, with the only thing holding me back being the slight chance I'm wrong or calling this way too early. But I have buy orders all the way down the pop, and am convinced it will be happening in the relatively near future. What I am telling you, is that ignoring bitcoin, and the disruptive potential that it has because some people are speculative idiots may possibly be one of the worst mistakes that you can make. 
Don't fall into the trap of ignoring it because it sounds silly. Do your research to validate your position. Because like it or not, this is happening. You won't get too many more times after this current bubble to get in low. Smarter and smarter money is starting to pay attention.

That's the entire name of the game. If your electricity costs less than $.10 per kwhr, it could be viable. Also, the initial cost of hardware is substantial so you have to earn that back. And the miner won't be viable forever so it won't make money forever. The S7 is getting old and reaching the end of it's viable life.
Also, most people underestimate the annoyance of a miner... Imagine a shop vac running full blast, giving off the heat of a space heater. It runs at 1400W which is as much/more than any other appliance in your house. It's not something you can just put in your closet and forget is there.

The point wasn't whether it is a joke or not, the point is literally disproving your statement that ASICs are the only thing keeping it from being attacked, which is 100% verifiably fucking wrong.


So do graphics cards. In fact, with miners colluding and removing the hash power to BCH, its arguable that ASICs make it "damn SURE" that no body can disrupt their oligarchy on hash power.


It would cost far more than $10,000 to accumulate enough GPU power to overtake it. Sorry, that's just dumb.


No, because like I said, its the cryptography that protects the coins from being spent. That's what people care about. The ability to store money in a fixed supply asset, that can't be seized by government. Your private key protects the coins not the ASICs. Literally the only thing an attacker can do is stall the coin, or double spend, both of which are clearly obvious attacks. Once again, clear display of ineptitude on your part.

First off, allocation of capital in efficient areas is in fact contributing to society's overall wealth. Resources are scarce, and efficient allocation of resources, is a valuable activity.
Secondly, the question was what happens when the price has reached an equilibrium point, and speculation is no longer an option. 
Clearly you have some wealth envy problems you need to deal with internally. If trading/speculation was so easy, why don't you do it, make millions and allocate that money how you see fit whether that be paying more in your own taxes, funding charities, or giving it to people on the street.

I'm not very worried about the shorting, because while most "financial professionals" view bitcoin on the surface as a joke, and "tulips", those who actually invest the time into learning what it actually is, and the concept of programmable money, very quickly learn the true potential. 
It's very easy for financiers to simply stick their heads in the sand, call it tulips, laugh and move on, because there's no cost to that. Sure maybe some opportunity cost, but if they are right, then the time spent researching it to confirm it would be wasted time and money. From their perspective, it seems ridiculous on the surface, they don't have the time to confirm their suspicions, and so they just stay away. 
That being said, any institutional financier worth their salt knows everything about what they are trading. Anyone who shorts bitcoin on the "gut feeling" that it is "tulips" deserves to lose all the money they are going to. I think many investors will be drawn to the aspect of shorting it, and making a quick buck, but in the process of researching their move, they will likely learn what bitcoin actually is, and why it goes well beyond a mania, at least at the core. 
So while I can see an initial massive short to shake weak hands and drop the price, I think the idea of making it worth analysts time to actually research bitcoin and what it is will end up being very bullish in the medium to long term. Also, it's entirely possible that the futures are anticlimactic and nothing spectacular happens at all, at least for a long while.

It isn't a stock. Stock is equity in a cashflow generating company. Bitcoin is a portion of a combined asset class, designed to have a financial platform built on top of it, that we collectively recognize as value. 


This should scare the shit out of you. News companies are literally owned by equity firms. They don't have your best interest at heart. What incentive do they have increasing the price if they truly believe it has value. This is the herd being lead to the slaughterhouse.  


Under what grounds do you base that analysis? Blind hope and luck? Combined market cap of bitcoin is hardly over .25T even with this 2 day 50% rise. That's pennies for wall street. Mom and pop don't have the buying power to hold up a combined mass exodus of bitcoin if/when wall street is to dump it. Supply will be overwhelming, any buy orders will be filled no matter how low, and no one will want to buy on a massive drop. It's going to be an engineered bust. 


Again, they own the media. They aren't doing this in your best interest. And no, you don't have the available capital to fight Wall Street. 
Think about it... long term bitcoin has the potential to be a world reserve currency. It is ready for that today with the one missing ingredient being *trust* that tomorrow it won't be worth 90% less what it was today. If Wall Street sees that, why on earth would they buy in late? Why would they buy in at retail? Wall Street doesn't buy retail anything. They are the retailers. They are going to take advantage of the "bubble narrative" by "ignoring it" (JP Morgan lead analyst coincidentally comes out less than a month later and says they were wrong, it's the next gold... hmmm) and then activating it by being the catalyst. All weak hands sell, they buy at bottom dollar, and then they let it grow. 
There will be a massive correction shortly. You can't fight it, but you can realize it. Immediately following the correction when Wall Street has gotten their share (and profited by shorting the shit out of it on the way down) prepare for the narrative post crash to be "well now with short pressure bitcoin is finally balanced at its true value and can grow organically" (releasing the idea of a bubble). 
There's going to be one last crash before we go mainstream. And this one will be one for the ages. But if you think wall street is just going to roll over and admit they were wrong, you are very naive. And no one has the ability to fend off a Wall Street combined effort to crash something. Prepare as you will.

Please point to a single place where I tried to "convince you to buy"? I never once did. In fact, I explicitly told you numerous times that this was a terrible time to buy. I believe I already told you I have cashed out a substantial amount for the time being. This is a speculative nightmare right now. 
I was asking you the price point at which you would buy to both logically show you that it is in fact worth more than $0, and to get you to actually validate your statement that you believe it is worth more than $0 (which I still don't think you do but it being worth more than $0 is a crucial axiom to Gresham's law taking place.... the original claim to which you replied "����")... if it has value which you admitted it did, and a transactional protocol, there is no reason to believe Gresham's law *cant* take place. In fact, it *already has in several locations around the world*. 


Once again, I never once tried to convince you to buy anything. I could give fuck all what you do. I was trying to use logic to pin you down and show you that you were wrong and you continued to side step the questions because you knew you were wrong.  




I appreciate that, but you clearly took it the wrong way. I don't ever tell anyone to buy something they don't understand.

Gold isn't going to help you if SHTF either. 
I was in a hard hit area during Hurricane Harvey that had pretty much all access in and out cut off in addition to power and water cut off. I could have been throwing around gold bricks and everyone would still be crowded around the people handing out fresh water and food rations. 
Gold bugs have a weird fantasy about SHTF and how they will be so well prepared, when in reality, no one is going to give a shit about anything other than necessities.

There's overwhelming evidence to show that charitable giving needs to go beyond just dumping money and resources into an area. A lot of times, doing so can obliterate any semblance of an economy that was there and turn the entire area into a dependent, beggar state.

It's not that complicated...
Computer logic:
If Coinbase account user with social security number cashes 100K out of bitcoin, then put audit marker on that individual to check return for a few thousand dollars of capital gains taxes on return. 
If social security number with audit flag claims capital gains and either posts an early estimate in lieu of withholdings for STCG, or claims it as LTCG, remove the flag. 
Your tax return goes through computer logic before anyone actually looks at it. If you cash out of bitcoin, IRS is already flagging your return to be audited. Enough flags, you get a visit. If you pay, let's say 20K on 100k in capital gains, they aren't going to come audit you to see if you should have paid 22K. It isn't worth their time. If you have a flag but claim not capital gains whatsoever, they most definitely are going to audit you.

First off, 6% per year is a little on the conservative side in terms of growth (meaning worst possible scenario in terms of loss) and also doesn’t account for the rise of productivity due to computers and the internet which occurred rapidly for all the decades after that. Productivity is what fuels actual the stock market growth (mutually exclusive from the speculation). 
So, 60% loss at worst case scenario sounds far better off than hanging onto a toxic asset down 70%, *before* its biggest elephant in the room (tether) has fully shaken out.

All I know is it's a visual representation of data, and it makes it easier to see representative points for the same data set. Graphs for Vibration profiles not only use logarithmic scale, but also square their units and have very funky graphs. It simply matters what information from the graphs you want.

Thats what is meant by a logarithmic scale. What you are talking about (equal spacing) is a linear scale. Logarithmic scales are based off of exponential increases, otherwise known as order of magnitude. It is frequently used in science and math fields where data within the same magnitude is related, while data of different magnitudes is different.
For example, it we are talking about a change in force from 1lb to 10 pounds, we would make around the same type of structural changes as we would if we were going from 100 lbs to 1000lbs. Its just that the first change would go from super light duty to heavier duty, and the second would go from heavier duty to super heavy duty. But in terms of relative change, its still about the same amount with respect to their beginning values. Think percentage changes.
Its also the same reason why a couple million on the national debt is a drop in the bucket, when a couple million in debt for you personally would be catastrophic.

I have to agree with that one. Its sort of like a straw man argument when people claim the blockchain is something easy to understand. While being a public ledger is accurate, and its nice to simplify it in order to explain bitcoin, actually reading the blockchain is like trying to follow Chinese calculus.
Now that doesn't mean that if we had such a big change such as the government running on bitcoin that we wouldn't see a lot more interest and very smart people using computers to decipher the bitcoin blockchain to follow important money trails, but lets face it: bitcoin can be used exactly like tor to launder money. Just flood the blockchain with thousands if not millions of tiny transactions to many different wallets, and it would be impossible to realistically follow the money.
Not that it would be bad to see the government switch to bitcoin as their method of currency, but I see it as an oversimplified argument that we could easily follow their money.

That's as stupid of a question as "what computer do you think he encrypted it with"?
The computer contains an os, which contains software stacks. Certain software stacks (like FileVault) can remain unchanged while others do change, and the overall operating system is changed. It's all mutually exclusive. Bash is a perfect example, because it's included, unchanged, in many different os's.
The drive isn't encrypted with the os. The drive is encrypted with FileVault 2, which as shown, has weaknesses. Unless you can find a change log, that states they updated that specific weakness (they haven't, you can google it, you can still do it *right now*), that point sticks.

It's a pretty solid myth that gold gets its value from its use in circuits. [Less than 15% of gold mined is used or electronics]( and the amount used in electronics has dropped substantially over time. As circuits consolidate, they are put into ICs, which are put into silicon. 
Because it is soft, and doesn't corrode, most of it is used for jewelry, followed by investment purposes. And just like diamonds, it's more the controlled supply, and presumed value from historical significance that gives it its value. It costs ~$400 per ounce to mine and yet the going rate is $1250 per ounce.
Gold is just as speculative as bitcoin. Probably more so, when you think about the limited amount of purposes it serves.

Not sure if you are actually serious, but I'll take it you are. If you are involved in bitcoin you'll notice that transactions are becoming slow *and* expensive relative to what they were... That's because the size of the blocks can only handle so much transaction information, and we hit the 1MB limit like a year ago. There's an ongoing feud between the two camps, Bitcoin Core (the older, established software) and Bitcore Unlimited (a new, unestablished software to take over the blockchain) that raises the size of the blocks, which would make transactions cheaper and faster again, at least until that block limit is inevitably hit.
Bitcore has a few different solutions to increase transaction capacity (google Segwit and LightingNetwork), but they are largely untested. It's not a great idea to test brand new ideas on a $20B network tool.
Bitcoin Unlimited is a much smaller team, and has recently shown many bugs because the team isn't near as experienced. It was just hacked yesterday causing half the nodes running it to go down temporarily. If Bitcoin Unlimited was the main software, and that was to happen, it could tank the currency, and also kill a $20B financial tool.
Ultimately people want to fix the transaction problem, but they are arguing about how they want to do it. There's threats of doing a hard fork, which would be like rolling the dice with $20B and would probably result in some pretty sharp crashes to begin with. The problem Bitcore has with increasing the block size, is its only temporary unless you want to keep increasing it. At some point, those blocks are going to get so big that it will take a full mining pool to be able to solve anything, centralizing the power with the miners, which completely kills the purpose of bitcoin.
No one wants to compromise due to ego, nervousness, and other reasons. Neither group can get a significant portion of miners to win out, so we remain at a stalemate. Meanwhile, fees keep getting higher, and transactions are taking hours even if you pay the higher fees. The world economy is debt ballooned to unsustainable levels, and could come crashing down at any moment if a China or Europe bank goes down, and bitcoin would likely be a huge safe haven, until people realize it can't handle that volume, and it gets abandoned for another coin that can.
Pretty much one of, if not one of the most defining problem for the history of the coin. Meanwhile, nothing is being solved.

Those hubs need to pay the same fees as you do. It's an open market. 
If the barrier to entry is low, there's no reason they would collude. It makes no economic sense. If anyone can make a profit by charging half of what the hubs do, they will. Barriers to entry cause centralization. Look at any monopolistic industry, and the main factor is the astronomical barrier to entry. The end goal is a layer that mimics perfect competition, whether that be on layer 2 or layer n. We recognize that it isn't possible on layer 1 while still retaining the benefits of ASICs. 
Edit: Also, the interest of the hub is to offer a cheaper option than the blockchain. If anyone can start a hub, it makes it virtually impossible to control everyone as a whole to collude. Everyone is going to work to their own profit. 
The same exact thing happened to retail. Hardly anyone pays MSRP anymore because you can find a cheaper alternative online. The barrier to entry of an ecommerce website is minimal compared to the startup costs of a big box retailer, and they are feeling the pressure. If you can buy a product for wholesale, and then sell it cheaper than the other guy and still make a profit, it makes financial sense to do so. 
By allowing miners to set the blocksize, you are allowing them to set the wholesale cost. Sure there may come a time where fees get high enough even with second layers, that the community as a whole decides to up the block size, but letting the miners alone decide that ends up with a situation exactly like that of OPEC. It would be a situation like gas stations. Gas stations don't set the price, they just have a standard markup. Except rather than letting OPEC decide how much oil to produce, everyone as a whole decides how much oil to produce. The gas stations then just apply their markup and move on.

From my understanding (anyone feel free to correct me where I'm wrong), that's where payment channels like the lightning network come into play. 
Essentially "legitimate use" would be any time you need a highly secure transfer of value. Whatever you deem is in need of that, you are free to decide. Just know there's going to be a fee involved. 
Take your coffee for example. When you buy it, you can enter into a payment channel with Joes coffee shop, pay your $1.50, and it shows up instantly in both of your wallets as a debit and credit accordingly. What's really happening, is you both signed a smart contract, saying "unless a new contract validates this one, I agree to pay this person this amount of money when they choose to redeem it." It's only valid if both signatures are present, so they can't go back and change it, because you're not there to sign it. 
This transaction can be done for free, instantly because it's done off chain. You go on your way. Joe, at the end of the day, just redeems all of the contracts, on the network all at once, and pays the $.50 fee to cash in of a couple hundred $ for his days work. 
Another useful example: Joe has an open account with his food distributor. Rather than them billing him for every time they make a delivery, they just keep creating new smart contracts. They can keep adding as more orders go through, and they can even refund him some money on a bad order, all taking place off chain. At some time that they decide, they can redeem the amount of the previous contract, and settle it, paying the market fee, and have one transaction for that whole period of time on the chain. 
In tests, they have claimed LN to be "better than VISA" which processes 100,000s of transactions per second. The concern from miners is they lose out on all these transaction fees. But because they control the amount of transactions that can fit per block, they have some control over the pricing, and a fair fee market is provided. If the miners get too greedy, more and more transactions just stay off chain and they lose money by not processing transactions. If they process too many, they don't get as high reward (because your transaction is included regardless of your fee amount). So it finds a mutually beneficial market price to send things on the blockchain. 
Right now, there's already off chain transactions happening with Bitpay and Coinbase, and if we don't see Segwit implemented, we will continue to see that happening.

Idk. I guess it's always possible, but it just seems like a very huge risk for no real payoff. Even if they get control, and they control 51% of the hashing power, most bitcoin purists would leave the coin because it totally upsets the premise behind bitcoin. At which point, another coin in it's place (or the original BTC) will pick back up with the primary principles. It just seems like a lose-lose for them. I honestly think they just want BU so that they can control the fees. I don't think the conspiracy goes much deeper than that.

There's about 144 blocks a day and reward size halves every 2 years. 
Immutability/noncensorship is in fact one of the core reasons bitcoin was developed. 
The problem with increasing the total amount, is there's a fundamental faith built into the idea that bitcoin is fixed at 21M units. That is just a fact of bitcoin. If you change that, you leave the door open to the top limit. If it's changed once, why wouldn't it be changed again. That would be detrimental to bitcoin. The total amount *cannot* and *should not* be changed if bitcoin is to survive. There's a reason it's so divisible, but there's a cap. It's because the reason fiat money is bad is because it can be inflated to steal from those who hold it. Fixed/no inflation is a fundamental aspect of bitcoin, and without it, it's just not bitcoin.  
Fortunately, it would require a hard fork, and most would not agree to that, so the inflated coin would likely die off. 
Edit: to your point, yes if we started with 40M it wouldn't make a difference in trajectory, it would just be probably about half the value. But changing it would be detrimental. My original reply to the guy was more referencing a discussion I had in another thread where he was ok with the idea of increasing the total cap. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:12:49
I think it more has to do with the practicality factor of ethereum. It has a programming language built on top of it. Its not bitcoin, its not going to beat out bitcoin's purpose, and it won't ever be bitcoin.
Bitcoin has all the characteristics it needs to be the best store of value ever conceived over a long enough period of time. It doesn't need to be superman.
Is it possible that ethereum market cap beats out Bitcoin, possibly in the near future? Sure. But with the rate new ether is introduced to the market, it inflates massively faster. Its an entirely different entity for an entirely different purpose. As Andreas Antonopoulos has said, "In the past, people fled bitcoin into fiat. Now they are fleeing into other parts of the industry. That's a good thing." (paraphrased)
Everyone needs to relax and realize its ok for other things to serve other purposes. If you are in bitcoin for the short run, you should be scared. If you are in it until it actually becomes mainstream, we haven't even scratched the surface of future value.
The entire industry has a market cap of &lt;25B. To put that into perspective, ExxonMobil's revenue last year was 218B, down from 2015. Think of how much wealth storage there is across the planet, and how much there is from the 50% of the world that is unbanked. Now imagine even a fraction of that, being put into bitcoin. If even 20% of gold's market cap is put into bitcoin, the price would be around $100K.
tl;dr- Quit freaking out about $400/btc losses. Bitcoin has proven itself to be the primary value store in the space. Now people are just exploring other options for different purposes.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:40:29
I'm more talking about BU supporters saying I told you so to Core supporters. If they are right, and we run into Segwit limits fairly quickly, it all but ensures they get their way, and they get to shove it in Core's face.
If they are wrong, they get faster transactions, lower fees, and no value loss that would inevitably ensue with a hard fork.
From a game theory perspective, the BU stance makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:29:20
It's because BU isn't about speed it's about control. They want to be the OPEC of transactions. Just look at Jihan's recent post. He outright says Segwit decreases miners profits and that it's only natural to protect one's interest. 
I respect his position, and if I was in his position I'd probably agree, but if my entire fortune rested on a POW change, I'd be looking to negotiate.

Dash is a pump, but ethereum has an entirely different purpose than bitcoin, and so there's innovation and money pouring into the space for those reasons. It's probably overvalued, yes, but I don't understand when people compare bitcoin and ethereum. That's like comparing gold and gas. Yes, having a lot can make you rich, but one gets consumed for a purpose and the other gets held for a store of value.

Ya, no, it's about FileVault 2, the current generation. The fundamentals of the system haven't changed within the version of this generation. ***LITERALLY SENTENCE NUMBER 1***
From the paper you obviously didn't read:
*With the launch of Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), Apple has introduced a volume encryption mechanism known as* ***FileVault 2***. *Apple only disclosed marketing aspects of the closed-source software, e.g. its use of the* ***AES-XTS*** *tweakable encryption, but a publicly available security evaluation and detailed description was unavailable until now.*
Later on, literally still on the first page...
*Since the launch of Mac OS X 10.7, also known as Lion, Apple includes a volume encryption software named FileVault 2 [8] in their operating system.* ***While the pre- vious version of FileVault (introduced with Mac OS X 10.3) only encrypted the home folder, FileVault 2 can en- crypt the entire volume containing the operating system (this is commonly referred to as full disk encryption).***


AES in it's classical sense is. This is XTS-AES-128, [a special case of AES-128 specifically for file encryption on disk drives that doesn't use a stream.]( It would be retarded to use non symmetrical encryption for disk encryption.
Also from the paper:
*Among other data, the header block contains also the size of the entire volume (in- cluding metadata), another UUID which is used as a key to decrypt part of the metadata (see details later),* ***and a CRC32 checksum.***
And because you clearly have no idea what you're talking about with encryption beyond what your little fingers can grab quickly off google:
***[A checksum is calculated using a HASH FUNCTION](


How's your foot taste? Have you ever heard of a [Watermarking Attack?](

What on earth are you on about? You can have a consumer preference for anything. I could have a consumer preference for a miner who also provides free blowjobs. If it is economically beneficial somehow to provide that, the free market would fit itself to that preference, and the miner who didn't give free blowjobs would lose to the one who did. No obviously, that isn't economically feasible, so we don't get that. But that doesn't mean the consumer's preference is limited.  


And when they try to strong arm the system, their product no longer aligns with preferences (a decentralized system that isn't coercible) and we change the POW again, changing our preferences (we choose to not deal with asshole number 2)


Yes, economies of scale is a result of consumer preferences. I have said that time and time again. But coercion isn't. You can have centralization without coercion. And when they try to coerce, they no longer align with consumer preferences, and lose their monopoly status to the guy who doesn't coerce, or we just relevel the playing field. 
You seem to think it's the tail wagging the dog. Just because the system we have in the US encourages monopolistic structures and limits choices by raising barriers to entry, does not mean that monopolies get to drive consumer choices in a free market. What we have is not a free market and it isn't capitalism. Stop with your boogeyman that doesn't exist. Look at the Nordic countries Bernie Sanders loves to call socialist. In actuality, the prime minister came out and said ["No, we are free market"]( 
The free market allows consumers to have a choice. A regulated market allows for companies to entrench themselves. 


No you don't. I can prefer anything I want. That doesn't mean I'm going to get it, but if enough people agree with my preferences of decentralization (they do) it's entirely possible for the community to do a POWC. It's already being talked about.

Since it's entirely a supply and demand market, it depends on how much demand is actually shifted over.
If people decide to shift over to one coin, the demand drops on the other. If it is evenly split, the demand is evenly split.
Hell for all we know, there could be 2 prominent bitcoins in the long term future, one for high security transfers, one for micro transfers.
No one knows. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and have faith that people will see the value in cryptocurrencies, even with layers built on top. Spread your net wide enough that you catch the next big alt currency, but not too thin that you lose money on pointless coins and don't make enough on top performing coins.
This game is just like venture capitalism. Take some risky bets and hope your winners can out beat your losers. At the end of the day be happy that you have a roof over your head and food in your belly because you're better off than most if you can invest in cryptocurrency.

Jesus H Christ this is getting old...
Literally sentence number one AGAIN:
***It depends entirely on what you mean by "message". If you can append four bytes of gibberish to one of the messages. (I.E. four bytes that have no meaning within the context of the message.) Then it becomes trivial in the truest sense of the word.***
So, "if you can append for bytes of gibberish to one of the messages...then it becomes trivial in the truest sense of the word". In other words, you picked an entirely different situation to prove your point. They are comparing an encrypted file to a known file. Even if they *were* appending gibberish to the known file, that would be easy for the defense attorney to simply call in an expert witness and dismiss the evidence. 
CRC32 has a chance of (N-1)/2^32, odds of generating the same hash. In other words 1/4294967296 chances of that happening. To put that into perspective, the chances of winning the mega millions lottery is almost 17x more likely to happen. You are more likely to be struck by lightning 3 fucking times in a row than it happening. Just because something is theoretically possible, doesn't make it actually possible. There's something called convergence, where if the number of possible chances for it happening don't go to infinity, then you can draw a limit where something is impossible. Even without convergence, the threshold of a courtroom is only beyond that of a *reasonable doubt*. If you were in a bar and some guy was trying to tell you he had been struck by lightning 3 times, it's entirely reasonable to doubt it happening, even if it is theoretically possible. 
You can't just keep throwing random accusations without backing things up. That's how liberals argue. You said it wasn't possible to see the hashes of a file. Then you claimed that AES-XTS was a streaming crypto, which I pointed out it's not. Then I showed you how it's possible with FileVault 2. Then you said that the paper didn't apply to FileVault 2. I showed you it did. Then you said that it was an older version, I showed you it wasn't. Then you claim that it's possible to manufacture the hash of two files. I just showed you that is a particular case where they have control over very simple "messages". I don't know what your next accusation is going to be, but do you see your backpedaling pattern here? You aren't fooling anyone. 
Yes, I'm under 30, went to public schools, and I graduated top of my class in mechanical engineering, a curriculum that *requires* linear algebra, literally the math behind cryptography.

Does that somehow make her understand cryptography and liner algebra infinitely better than me? Don't throw your fleeting logical fallacies at me. 
Even if you don't buy that I'm of expert level over you, are you really contending to being at or above the same level of cryptographic forensic scientists?

I think you are tying too much of bitcoin's intrinsic value to how much it costs to produce each bitcoin. While it definitely plays a role, I don't think its as much of a driver as the absolute fixed quantity, and ease of transferability. What else in the world serves as a transfer of value store and is as truly scarce as bitcoin? You could argue manufactured collectables, where manufacturing has ceased, but then again, look at the price of those items. The less there are, the more people want them.
Tie into that the utility of bitcoin... People in Venezuela have no other option. Their inflation is astronomical, that keeping cash for even a day could mean it is worth less later. Their constant demand for bitcoin, to fuel their residual economic actives, with the fixed supply play much more role than the mining activities. They are the ones who are actually giving it a true purchasing power.
Then you have the speculative aspect of it, which I believe drives it the most. Again, with the sight fixed on a single amount, people realize that hoarding is going to be beneficial in the long run, as it becomes more widely accepted. Sure we don't have a financial crisis here, but it seems every time there is one, people turn to bitcoin. The supply doesn't increase proportionally, and subsequently more people hoard, driving the supply down further, with marginal increases in demand every day. Speculative holding is by far the most influential in the price of bitcoin, and I would argue why it is so resilient. There's a sentiment of "it swings +/- 50% per day, so don't worry" and a little bit of "we've seen bubble pops before, just buy more while its cheap" that gives it an intrinsic demand. There's a true trust that it has an intrinsic value, much more different than what we saw in 2013 where no one was really even sure because it had only gone up, and never that high.
I'm not a miner, so I can't speak much on the mining side, but from my understanding most large scale miners sell almost immediately anyways just to cover cost, so they do offer a constant increase to the supply available to the market. But I think that factoring in the cost to produce bitcoin as it's *pure* reason that it cost so much is false. I believe bitcoin has the potential to take up 20% of gold's market cap at least in the far future, and would put it at around 100K per bitcoin (.2*8T/16M). It's not an unreasonable proposition, and at a certain point in that climb, you get so far away from the cost of electricity in terms of price, it really has minimal affect.
Btw, where are you paying $.35/kWh, average electricity cost in the US is like $.12, and where I am right now, its like $.06?

Holy shit, you are missing the point. *FINE*, we'll do it your way. We all just want to buy mangos from the little guy like we used to. Literally doesn't change a fucking thing. You realize that that *is* a preference that isn't tied to the current offerings right?


No I'm not, I'm paying for a mango ***that came from the small guy***, I.E. one that aligns with my preferences. That's why [conflict free diamonds]( is a market, because we can have any preference that we want, non dependent on the status quo or the current market offerings. If nothing in the market meets our preferences enough to buy from them, then we aren't forced to give our money up. WE *chose* to pay someone money in a free market.


Once again, keep those goalposts still buddy. You said "consumer preferences don't matter". Now you are saying "well they can matter but they will cost you a lot of money". I NEVER SAID THAT IT WOULDN'T. But you are claiming that it is impossible for said market to exist, no matter what the cost, if you are claiming that consumer preferences don't matter. Just like how walmart is a monopolistic structure, people *prefer* cheaper goods over not buying from a monopoly. But that doesn't mean it is *impossible* for people to *not prefer* cheaper goods, and to *instead* prefer buying from a non monopoly. And such a market exists, and you can go your entire life, not buying from walmart. And if enough people do the same as you, walmart goes out of business. BTW, the minimum wage is the *reason* walmart can assume a monopolistic structure and provide for so cheap. If there wasn't a minimum wage, they would need to come up with a wage that people are willing to work for. But instead they can point to the "minimum" and say it is justified. Without a minimum wage, wages overall would increase. There's a perfect example of how regulations *hurt* economies.


Ok, fine. But do you recognize that is literally a consumer preference?


I can already see where you're going with this and will wait to tell you why you are wrong...


No, no, no, no NO. Again, you literally say "the issue is that you **hate** (i.e. PREFER strongly against) mango centralization and want to buy mangos from the little guy like you used to."
So if I prefer to buy mangos from "the little guy" than I just go buy from farmers markets. I can set a rule: "I won't buy from any farmer who has a farm larger than an acre because I hate centralization". There's going to be some pretty high costs that go along with that preference, but *are you seriously arguing that such a rule would be impossible to live by?*
Let's say my buddies like my rule, and they chose to live by the same rule. Would it then be impossible for them to just buy from farmers within 1 acre farms?
Oops, economies of scale just took over.... Some farmer is building a skyscraper and growing mangos on every floor with a land footprint of only 1/2 acre.... Am I stuck with my rule? Can I not just add "and no skyscrapers" to my rule?
After enough time, the market establishes a character to it. Any supplier is *free* to try and game it any way they want, but it is just bad business practice and they will lose all their money (and thus capital to continue making bad decisions), if the fundamental concept of the market for "little guy mangos" is to be a "little guy".
If you can't admit that such a market could exist, we are done, because 2+2=4 not 5.

Well, as a result of this block size debate, it has been pretty heavily shown that larger blocks will result in bad consequences. 
I think everyone would like simple, easy solutions like increasing the block size, but unfortunately that's just not the objective reality of the situation. Technologies have limitations and need to be worked around. Brute forcing it, doesn't help the situation. 
You don't have to support Segwit, but if you are supporting larger blocks, you're going to need substantial evidence to back up why, because from what I've seen (I'm no expert) almost all of the prevailing minds say that larger block sizes would be severely detrimental. Segwit with LN is a solution that is ready and LN is tested enough to at least add some relief that it is a conservative effort to fix the problem without outright ruining the centralized nature of bitcoin. It may not be preferable, but it seems to be the best solution anyone has come up with.

The incentive may increase, but that doesn't make it any more technologically feasible. Bitcoin was technologically feasible with CPUs and GPUs, ASICs just made the difficulty increase substantially, which increases the security even more. But to think that someone can crack SHA256 or whatever other encryption method is chosen, and then attack the network with it is nonsense. It would be massively more economically efficient to try and game the lottery. 
In other words, the encryption of bitcoin alone is like a blastproof, concrete and rebar enclosed vault, buried well below the surface of the earth with state of the art security measures blocking the path along the way. A high hash rate is like hiring armed guards to stand out front. Nice for security, but if they try and extort the owner of the vault, we'll just fire them and do without them, or hire new ones with a precedent of firing those who try and extort us.

I just don't see Bitcoin coming together to fork the network, for a platform that many would argue already exists in a rather developed form right now. I mean, we can't even agree about fucking block sizes.
When/if we fork off for Rootstock, a significant portion of users aren't going to want to, especially if block sizes stay small. That will turn the Rootstock fork into an alt coin (just as if BU forks off) and will result in essentially the same thing. Rootstock is too late for the market. Ethereum is taking it and running with it. Does that mean it is the best option technically? Absolutely not. It means they got to market first and are offering the same things that would be coming out with Rootstock if/when it ever comes. There's no real incentive to switch IMO. I could be wrong, but I just don't see it happening. First to market is key in crypto.

There was a post of a translation of a post Jihan recently made that said this outright. Segwit removes transactions from the blockchain, directly affecting miner profit. He even states, it makes sense to fight for your own best interest. I understand and even agree with him to a point. I respect his understanding of the situation. 
But bitcoin is game theory 101, and when his interests cut into my interests as a user to not be manipulated by block size as OPEC does with oil, you can't expect me not to resist. Mathematically speaking, from a game theory stand point, there's a solution that benefits us both. The blockchain won't run without miners, and a blockchain without users is worthless. We both have stake in the outcome and the markets will show that.

There is a free "accelerator" somewhere that claims to make things faster, but obviously everyone is using it, so I didn't have any luck.
I found one of the main mining pools had an accelerator that you paid for (was like $2.25), and it was done in 4 hours. It was worth it to me to get $825 unstuck when it was still stuck 4 days later.

Changing the difficulty back to allow for GPU mining is trivial. It's literally one line of code, everyone on the original chain adopts the change, and we move on. While we're at it, let's get a POW change eliminating the future for ASICs because we know the outcome of that. 
What results? 3 chains:
- 1 entirely unusable, which the community at a whole would have no problem abandoning because of the hashing rate. Anyone who sells to buy into that chain is just stupid. 
- 1 chain that remains decentralized from a mining perspective, and remains open source so it is still decentralized from a development perspective, and the majority of the user services backing this as the true chain
- 1 chain that has centralized hash power amongst like 5 people, with an astronomical barrier to entry cost wise, that is completely changing the consensus rules, and entirely depends on people abandoning the chain that everyone would accept as the original, to an untested chain, that has been attacked numerous times in the past (twice in two weeks actually) who's development team has voiced the possibility of an increase in total supply of coins to "compensate the miners" as block rewards are trending to zero. An oh ya, they entirely control the block size, so there's no telling that they won't just operate like OPEC and charge high fees anyways. I mean let's be honest, the entire chain is derived from the idea of miner profits, why wouldn't they?
I really hope you heed my advice if/when a split comes, and don't sell off your BTC to buy BU. You don't have to sell off BU to buy BTC, but I promise you, you're being conned and you're gonna lose your money. 
The reason a high hash rate makes things more secure is it makes it harder for a dedicated party to pull a 51% attack because they would have to invest heavily into hardware. If you have miners congregating to do just that, then you aren't really being secured by that hash rate. You're being held hostage by it. 
This debate has been going on for months now, and the only thing that has grown substantially is BUs hash power. This isn't a matter of people just not knowing. This is a matter of people actively fighting off a hostile takeover.

For large sums yes. But many people were sold into bitcoin that you would be able to buy a beer at a bar and it would cost basically nothing more than the actual cost.
Technologies evolve, so its possible BTC is just a value store now, but that doesn't mean people don't feel shortchanged. Especially when there are easily implemented fixes tomorrow, and both sides are arguing for no reason other than politics.

Block size is too small, so the blocks are full, and transactions keep adding up, making the fees also go up. It now can cost like $1 at times to effectively send something with speed (and speed can still mean in under an hour), it used to take like $.02 and could happen in ~10 minutes.
That being said, there's now two divides on how to proceed.
1) Increase the block size, which would require a hard fork (Bitcoin Unlimited)
2) Implement a system called Segwit, which can handle smaller transactions and combine them into one big transaction, not clogging up the block chain. (Bitcoin Core)
The big wigs in the industry are at odds, and we have been in a stalemate for months, and it doesn't look like its getting any better any time soon. Tweets are tweeting, Hackers are hacking, and insults are being thrown around, all while both sides cook up some crazy conspiracy theories.
Increasing the block size would run the risk of centralizing the power to only the most powerful bitcoin mining pools. Also, the BU group consists of like ~10 developers with little experience, and the Core group has the ~80+ developers that have been working on it from the beginning. Segwit adds complexity, and may or may not be a long term solution. BU supporters also think it sets a precedent to not ever increase the block size, and centralizes the power with the Core group.
Ultimately, no one wants to compromise, and neither group can get the amount of adoption they think they need to work out. If BU gets to 51% they can hard fork off and there would be massive confusion as to which blockchain is the actual BTC blockchain and which one will die, and it will be a mess for a while. You're picking a pretty volatile time to get back in, so be prepared for a roller coaster ride, likely to start with some pretty sharp drops.

You're right, I don't really know shit about Rootstock (frankly I don't care because it's essentially irrelevant now if it does the same thing as Ethereum). Do you think Windows is a superior operating system? Why is it that &gt;70% of the computers in the world run an inferior operating system? Because it was the first one that succeed in the consumer market. Linux is FAR superior, and hell, certain distros are even easier than windows now, yet every enterprise system still seems to run windows without fail. Why? Because it's what people use, and the technical inferiority of windows can be dealt with to make it manageable. Does it make logical sense? Absolutely not. Is it the way things work? Most definitely.
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to disagree. History has shown many many times, that unless a substantially better option comes along (i.e. internet vs fax), we stick with the first to market. Maybe I'm wrong this time, but I have a very hard time believing you're going to get A) the bitcoin community as a whole to successfully hard fork (we can't even fucking agree about block sizes, now you want to implement a programming layer on top?) when there's already a working alternative and B) convince those already working on the alternative to migrate their projects (I doubt its as simple as running your code on a different platform. Migrations are never that simple), AND give up any stake they have in ethereum. Especially if we stick with smaller block sizes like it appears we are going to.

A second layer POW could be implemented with a UASF. I'm no pro on the matter, but I read the original proposal thread and it seems like the prominent idea. 
And it doesn't matter if you have 100% of the hashing power. The majority of the actual users, and the majority of all end user services overwhelmingly support Core, or at least NOT BU. Once BU splits off, POW will change with a soft fork, and all the users will just continue on with the decentralized chain. 
And before you try and give some blockstream conspiracy theory, there's nothing that stops the users from moving away from Core to the next decentralized model. The whole point is, the users who buy things with their bitcoin are what give it value. Sure the holders add to that value by limiting the overall supply, but you can manipulate supply all you want, if there's no demand, your price goes to zero. 
Who honestly wants to use a coin where a group of 3-4 mining pools control everything? The only people who support BU are miners, and people who are too dull to see a 10 person development team that can't even publish software without numerous bugs, and use the most basic excuse imaginable (high fees and wait times) to hand all the authority over to the miners.

I never said once economies of scale don't matter. But you're acting like consumer preferences and economies of scale are mutually exclusive, when in an unregulated market, economies of scale is by definition only useful when it aligns with consumer preferences. 
Economies of scale: "a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production"
I can take advantage of "economies of scale" by mass producing widgets all day long, and it will cost me marginally less to produce 1M widgets than it would 10. But if there is no demand for such widgets, the market price of them falls to zero. It doesn't matter how many I produce, if [economic demand]( doesn't exist, then I am doing nothing but wasting my money. 
Economies of scale follow consumer preferences. And as consumer preferences change, we see rearranging. I never once said we would have a perfectly decentralized system at all. If we changed the POW, we would definitely *temporarily* decentralize it though. And if the next asshat uses economies of scale to try and force his will, the consumer preferences once again change (from not wanting to give him our money) and we once again change our preferences. He could have all the hash power in the world, but if his product doesn't align with out demands, it doesn't do him any good whatsoever. We can continue on such path again and again, until it becomes obvious to miners that they are welcome to increase hashing power, but if you try to manipulate the market, consumers are going to cut you out. 
Such a system can *only* happen in an unregulated market. If the market was regulated, he could easily buy the power to change the code to favor his miners specifically, further increasing the cost to entry. But because the validation rests with the economic majority (the consumers) he can't do as such, because we can simply chose not to run his software. In a government run system, we would likely *have* to run his software. 
The free market has always allowed for unfettered growth that benefits consumers, even if it is overlayed with bullshit regulations. Consumer preferences always win out.

That being said, I don't understand why with an expert witness, matching hashes of know CP files *isn't proof*. It doesn't take an expert level of understanding of encryption to understand that matching hashes of a single file are neigh impossible (certainly beyond that of a reasonable doubt) to be generated from a different file. Combine that with the statistics of *multiple* matching hashes, and there should be no question. ***That's*** what needs to be addressed here, not that he's refusing to unlock it.

The white paper introduces the idea, with a method of implementation. It's not a bible, road map, or even a recipe. 
It's literally irrelevant what the white paper says from a technical standpoint. It's purpose, just like all white papers, it to introduce an idea. If more scalable ways come along, it logically makes sense to follow those ways. No one is saying a 1MB block size is permanent. If Core is, they will get left behind just like BU when a fork happens. But to not fix malleability, for fear of Segwit taking your profits (literally what Jihan Wu has stated) and instead just increase the block size is moronic. 
Imagine if the way to increase internet speeds was to keep adding more phone lines to your house. The idea of the internet didn't change, but the implementation and infrastructure did. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:55:49
I agree with your forward sightedness, but speculating on what will happen with LN and Segwit does no good.
I hear all big blockers saying Segwit isn't enough, but we don't know that. Maybe it is enough for the next few years and in that time someone else comes up with an even better scaling solution. Or maybe not and we deal with the block size as it comes to that. 
But right now we have a much better solution for scaling, even marginally, that will alleviate problems immediately, that we can't even use because some attackers at conjuring up conspiracy theories against the creators (many of which have already voiced support for bigger blocks anyways).
I have yet to get a straight answer (beyond that from Jihan Wu himself blatantly saying it would decrease his profits directly... at least he's honest) as to why it is a bad idea to impliment Segwit today, and deal with the block size if/when we come to the issue again.

From a technical stand point, it probably is. But the original "bitcoin" white paper described a decentralized payment system that could only be broken with a 51% attack, and it didn't include any code. 
So if a POWC makes bitcoin more decentralized, and less prone to a 51% attack, then it is "bitcoin."
It doesn't matter what the code looks like because the white paper didn't have any code to begin with. Also, the white paper isn't a gospel, it is the proposal of an idea. So if your changes more closely follow that idea than the original proposal, an argument can be made you are on the right track. 
The purpose of a car is a personal transportation vehicle. If you change how it is powered, or even operated, to make it more closely follow that original idea, is it no longer a "car"?

Also, Ethereum isn't as much of a currency as a platform. Ethereum value may have come a lot from bitcoin, but most people are holders of both. It's really the only alt that differentiates itself. Bitcoin is a value transfer, ethereum is a protocol.

Causing mayhem in the bitcoin world would be a quick way to get that capital diverted to other altcoins, promising a much higher percentage return than bitcoin can do right now.

You'll end up with 2 chains and your private keys will control coins on both. There's going to be a lot of confusion, people trying to sell the coins on the chain they don't believe is the "real" chain, prices are going to plummet, then subsequently rise quickly, then subsequently plummet, and one will eventually tend to a stable number while one drops to pretty much nothing.
BU's idea is that they can start a miner cartel, and basically be the OPEC of bitcoin.
The main problem for them... People are tossing around the idea of just changing the POW.... Basically rendering their multimillion dollar bitcoin facilities worthless.
Realistically, BU is most likely the first real attempt by the powers that be to try and kill bitcoin. China is notorious for it's corruption, and it's entirely possible Jihan simply has a gun to his head.
One way or another, BU is a shotty attempt at hijacking bitcoin for whatever reason. Luckily with the idea of changing POW, it completely invalidates their attempts.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:08:56
The idea behind a POW change is essentially hitting the reset button on bitcoin. The theoretical goal behind bitcoin was a decentralized, trustless payment network. A POW would essentially be putting us back to 2009 with the understanding that ASICs will eventually lead to centralization. It's obviously not an optimal solution and will probably put it back to 2009 prices, but it resets the focus back to the original goal of bitcoin.

*Any* type of utility? Sorry, but there's all sorts of innovation coming from the ethereum smart contracts platform. Considering you need ethereum to run those contracts, there is *certainly* utility. 
I agree it wasn't designed for financial purposes directly, and that it won't be immune to the same exact problems as bitcoin, but to shut your eyes and ears and pretend this isn't directly related to the gridlock hitting a pinnacle, is just naive. 
Is a significant portion of ethereum's rise trading speculation? Yes. But bitcoin had the exact same speculation that put it above the $200 mark for good. There's really no reason it couldn't completely adopt the bitcoin market cap if people get nervous, putting it at ~$200 per coin. Even half of that, $45 per coin is a bargain.
As a holder of both, I hope bitcoin gets its shit together, the BU nodes realize they aren't going to win and let Segwit activate before the entire coin comes crumbling down and replaced with another. This is do or die time this next few days.

I'm not sure I agree that we should just follow the path that makes it worth the most. 
The fundamental draw to bitcoin is that it is your money, its value can't be stolen from you due to inflation, and no one can freeze your account, steal your money, or really do anything to take those bitcoins away from you. 
It's valuation is secondary to that, and the rise in value is directly related to its scarcity, not necessarily its usability. If you surrender those things in exchange for a quick valuation increase, you surrender what makes bitcoin different from everything else. 
Where else can you put your money where no one but you has exclusive control of it, and that it can't have its value stolen through inflation tax?

But if Segwit isn't enough, and core still refuses to increase block size, why is it a problem to just fork *then*. Why does it need to happen now?
It seems like BU is trying to fix something that isn't broken. If Segwit fixes the problem, even at least temporarily, and it has been tested thoroughly, then why are we focusing on future issues. Let's fix the issue at hand with the solution that requires less drastic changes, and if it doesn't work, then hard fork. For all we know, Segwit could be enough to handle everything just fine and no other off chain solutions are necessary.

This would be huge for bitcoin in the long run. I think everyone involved in bitcoin post 2014 realizes this is a long term game, and doesn't really care too much about short term value dumps.

You are literally too dull to have a logical conversation with, so I'll give it one last go:
4th/5th amendment:
4th amendment- his fucking sister tells the cops he has CP. That alone, imo is just cause for a search. The article doesn't mention that was the only thing that lead them to him either so you can't exclude the possibility of him being involved in a sting operation on a site. His 4th amendment right wasn't violated, there was just cause to search. They just found encrypted information. 
5th amendment- ya, I agree, it's 100% bullshit he's sitting in jail for it. He's not required to self incriminate. End of story. If you look back at *every one of my posts* I say that, but since an autistic child's box of rocks is more intelligent than you I just spelled it out for you. Understand now?
***The whole fucking point*** is that they don't ***need*** to have him testify. It's ***entirely likely*** this ***is*** a scheme to set precedent to have people jailed for refusing to unlock things. I'm not arguing that. 
But you clearly don't understand the technical aspects of this, so let me lay them out:
Yes, FileVault 2 is the same implementation of FileVault that replaced the flawed version ***half a decade*** ago. The footnote you are reading, refers to point 1, a completely unrelated issue where plaintext data is un need-ably left unencrypted. You can still mount a FileVault 2 drive. Until you can produce some documentation to say otherwise, you don't win that argument. End of story. 
The checksum coming out the same in two different file in a collisioned algorithm is highly unlikely, one without a collision is mathematically impossible unless you can prove a collision. So therefore, if hash(a)=x *and* hash(b)x, a  and b ***must*** be the same file. That's demosontrably, objectively provable.
Disagree? ***Prove*** otherwise. 
Edit: "it would be trivial to produce scores of files that produce the same checksum?"
REALLY? Ok, I'm done. You're clearly in way over your head in this conversation. Show me literally one instance of that ever happening with a non collisoned algorithm, and I'll concede, because my entire argument rests on that single point (for a very legitimate reason).

These numbers are "get rich quick" style numbers, and we all know, it doesn't work like that. Bitcoin will grow as people find personal utility in it. That's what gives it value. Not people "buying it" but people buying it for a purpose beyond short term speculation.

Well rather than having a deadlock, the scaling debate would have even more fuel to their fire for their cause. Right now, there's legitimate concerns about not allowing the block size to get too big. I'm not saying there shouldn't be a resizing in the future.... I'm just asking why take such drastic measures when there is an immediate bandaid that will buy some time.
And most services and wallet developers have already updated their software to allow for segwit if/when it becomes available. For they layman, it will just look like any other wallet update, which they probably already have. That's a non issue compared to the mayhem that would ensue following a contentious fork. And make no mistake, it would be contentious. Even if BU won out overall, there will still be a group of purists that would ride the old chain to the floor.
Why is it such a big deal to set off scaling the block size (a MAJOR change) for another year?

What do you mean it's a fallacy? Ethereum/Rootstock and Bitcoin fill entirely different purposes, and thus have different markets. 
Thats like comparing the PC market to the operating system market. Yes the second market may depend on the existence of a PC market, but that doesn't mean whoever makes the OS designed for the PC *automatically* also gets first to OS market. They are mutually exclusive. 
If anything, it's looking like the bitcoin blockchain being somewhat slower is going to be a feature of it, and thus a major disadvantage to rootstock.
I don't know anything more about rootstock than you've told me, but I can assure you, the first to market in the smart contracts area is ethereum, (i.e. 4B market cap, EEA, hundreds of developers already working on the platform.) that train is gone. Rootstock can always come back with a better product, but it needs to be substantially better. See XBOX 360 in just about any marketing textbook ever.

Because a hard fork is obviously 10 times more involved than a soft fork. That's like saying lets try rebuilding the engine to a car before checking the spark plugs. One can be done much, much easier than the other and if it doesn't solve it, then you move onto more drastic measures. BU is in the camp of trying a full on drastic measure without even attempting to try the easy method first.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:09:31
And that's what I'm saying. Why is it so hard to just HF when the fees start raising again? With Segwit enacted, it allows more transactions per block, so fees will decrease anyways. So it fixes it short term, and in they don't come up with another fix quicker, the community can just use this as a case to show why we need to increase the block size. If they refuse, it's a pretty good reason to Fork then, and would be a lot less contentious.

I'm not saying it has to be a democracy. What I'm saying is a method of polling what the economic majority (i.e. User base) supports. The users give bitcoin value yet they are the only ones who can't be accurately captured opinion wise. 
Make the wrong move without the economic majority on your side and you are going to lose a lot of money. Both sides would benefit from a solution that accurately measures user base input.

Decentralization is a higher priority than casualties of war. There's going to be winners and losers in this, make no mistake in that. Miners understood the risk they were taking when they invested in single purpose hardware designed to run open source software. They took all the risk and should get all the reward or take all the loses. But a centralized coin would directly kill bitcoins sole purpose.
Luckily for them, most the ideas being thrown around are a POWA, where they would need a logical and arithmetic solution, so their hash power wouldn't go to waste it would just have to be matched with CPU power. 
But people need to understand that free markets are what allow for ASICs to rake in profits, and free markets also allow consumers to render those useless. You can't blame consumers for putting dial up businesses out of work.

The original Bitcoin white paper also warned against 51% attacks, but look where we are headed...
I don't see anything wrong with a few slight changes that re level the playing field, if the user base as a whole supports it. I take it you are a miner, and as such, you are part of the user base and have a voice. But the miners don't own bitcoin. At least now how it was originally conceptualized. It may have devolved into that, but that's not what people signed up for.
I'd be totally or a second level POW situation that needs CPU intensive calculations in addition to hash calculations. Then any user can't mine a block without a miner (hasher) and any miner can't mine without a user, or at least investing even more money to try and recentralize it. At which point they understand there is a precedent to just change POW again.
Centralization was never the point of bitcoin.

Exactly. "Bitcoin" the idea was designed by Satoshi. Bitcoin the implementation was developed by a group of talented developers in an open source format. 
Ideas are a dime a dozen. Yes his idea was brilliant, but everyone knows having an idea and implementing are two entirely different things. Unexpected results (ASICs leading to centralization) show up all the time when trying to implement, and are dealt with when they appear.

- Every major service provider has publicly voiced their support for at least the most popular coin, if not Core directly. No major service has expressed support for BU exclusively. 
- [The userbase is pretty clear on the topic.]( it's pretty clear BU is in the minority when they are mining more blocks, but have less than 15% of the nodes. That should tell you only prominent miners are supporting this.
- if that's not enough evidence for you, go ahead and check any of the prediction markets for the price of BU. The one celebrated as more fair is lower in price than the bitfinex one. 
You make no sense. Why would the majority need to restart on separate code every time it gets attacked? If you wish to change the status quo, you need the majority support. If you don't have it, then you are responsible to start another chain, not those in the original chain. No one is obligated to follow your rules just because you throw a temper tantrum.

I see your point with the first one, but I disagree with the mob rule one. 
If the mob rule was to consistently attack those with the most, it would be in your long term disadvantage to partake in that situation. As it would be everyone else's. I think that would play out, even ever so slightly, in people's decisions. If you keep taking from the richest, either you remain in the poorest (as well as that person you just stole from) or you then become the richest and are under attack. 
I think it's a self regulating system to a degree. The world is run by people pursuing their own separate interests. The reason we use rules is because we can prove that both people are better off with that rule, than without it, even if that rule limits your maximum well being slightly. In other words, some is better than nothing.

This is perfect circumstances. If this same attack came with the masses using bitcoin, no doubt the user base would fold for the short sighted solution of BU. But if bitcoin succeeds, it not only can boast it is decentralized, but that it fought off a full fledged attack of centralization. Many solutions are coming out right now that we wouldn't have time for with the masses involved. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:06:36
More likely a power play to let them know they won't be getting what they want (support as the "true" bitcoin) anywhere that it actually matters.
The exchanges are really what set the value of it... If you can't convert it into your country's legal tender, it becomes substantially less valuable in the short term. This is telling them, "sure, you will be listed *right alongside of bitcoin, as a completely different name, indistinguishable from any other alt coin*." This solidifies them as an alt coin, and alienates them from the main group that actually gives it value, without actually having to actually attack them.
If anything, this kills the threat of a HF.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:00:56
It's most likely from individual miners supporting his pool, in order to increase the likelihood of a Segwit block to be mined. This will quickly disperse when/if something changes. 
And BU isn't forking anything. The BU client code is a mess, and the miners know it, they're just using it to filibuster. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:40:05
 &gt; price of Bitcoin is manipulated by a relatively few people to keep the value increasing
Over 100,000 transactions on exchanges alone per day, and growing, that doesn't constitute a "relatively few people" considering that most people buy and hold.


It has value for storing value, just as gold does. There's a scarce amount, it's proven to be extremely secure in transfer of funds, and has withstood multiple devastating events that have caused it to temporarily "crash".
Considering most gold is traded in ETFs, 99% of people who "own gold" actually just own an account that says they own gold. So basically they just own an outdated form of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:00:21
Well those p2p networks can take place, on top of the main block chain. But the idea of fitting the world's transactions, in unabridged form, into a single block every 10 minutes is a dream we are now realizing isn't a reality without giving up the decentralization (arguably bitcoin's core value). 
There are already methods that will make micro transactions possible, on a second layer, for much cheaper. Yes it centralizes those transactions, but you still have the option of a block chain level transfer if you prefer. But there's a price to pay for using the world's most secure block chain. 
What do you think is going to happen to fees and transaction times when miners control them entirely. OPEC controls oil production, and directly controls the price. You think they have the oil users' best interest at heart? Basic economics would tell you they will take advantage of their newfound power to maximize their profits. Even Jihan himself admits they are fighting Segwit because it would reduce the number of transactions on the block chain, and thus the amount of fees. BU would just lead to them processing just enough transactions to keep people using it, but never enough to the point they don't make a profit. And the miners alone choose what that profit level is. The users have no reason to deincentivize the miners, given they are processing their transactions for them.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:50:46
The fees aren't extremely high, but having to wait 4-5 hours for a transaction? Bitcoin isn't sustainable at a $20B market cap right now if there are other alternatives that can do it faster and cheaper.
Coinbase just said it won't be covering fees anymore, and now there's a major backlog of transactions out of coinbase. Major vendors are dropping support because the fees don't make sense anymore. And to top it all off, the Ethereum price is looking like a rocket ship, and is boasting much higher % return for the same money, and the market isn't super saturated.
I'd like to see bitcoin pull through, but if the devs don't get their shit together soon, there's no real reason for people to stay on this ship and not leave to another. I've seen more news on the fees in the past month than I have in the past year, and meanwhile, ethereum has basically tripled in price in the same amount of time.
Talks of a hard fork, miner takeover, centralization... No one signed up for any of this shit.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:17:34
The same principals that grew bitcoin from nothing are what will keep it alive. Imagine 2 years from not after the hard fork. Let say BU somehow manipulates the markets, gets support for their coin and they become the new "bitcoin". 
As a newcomer to bitcoin, you can either buy a coin that has all its fees and transaction rates in complete control of a few miners (like OPEC does with oil) or you can buy a coin that is decentralized, but has a significantly less hash rate. If you are getting into bitcoin for the reasons people do (decentralization, no ability for government takeover, no ability for anyone to coerce), it's a no brainer. Bitcoin may "die" temporarily, but BU literally can't survive. They will implode by trying to abuse their powers, or the massive propping up will eventually fall through.
Bitcoin may take a big hit yet again, but the idea, and the original code will still live on. It won't moon for quite a while, and maybe never, but the fact still remains there will be a decentralized currency, with a limited supply, that no one but you can control. That's a multi billion dollar idea. That's what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 03:53:33
Many things will change, but the fixed amount won't be one of them. That is fundamental to bitcoin, and can't be removed. It's literally what gives it the value that it has.
And honestly, there isn't any need to do that, other than to steal value from the holders. What need is there to inflate the currency? You can divide it indefinitely, so its a moot point to act like somehow we will run out of the amount of it to disperse. But you can divide it further without detracting from the value of a whole coin, which is the entire purpose. You can't do that with fiat.

Regulations not held in check are bad. The idea of chasing POW and poof the powers at be are no different than anyone else is a huge trump card.
Libertarians aren't against *any* regulations. We are against regulations that play to the hands of a group trying to leverage them. That includes Core too. Right now, Core hasn't done anything to alarm anyone yet. If that changes, Core becomes the BU. I don't discriminate against attackers. I hate them all equally. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:28:41
85% of the nodes are running core because Segwit *is* a scaling option, that *has* been tested, and LightningNetwork will follow shortly thereafter.
If we somehow run back into the 1MB limit even after those changes, if Core doesn't want to change anything but let the fees rise, you can bet the majority of nodes are going to be running whoever forks off with a bigger limit that everyone agrees on.
Just because we are against BU doesn't necessarily mean we *love* Core. Although, they really haven't given a reason not to trust them... If so, please let me know?
"Holding the block size hostage"? Segwit is a SF block size increase. And several Core developers have expressed support for a HF block size increase in the past. They just realize the SF is the better option at the moment. BU is speculating some bullshit that if we don't increase the blocksize now, we will forever be at a 1MB block size.

I think something like that could be modeled off existing voting for corporations with shareholders. Now, that voting is typically for board members, but the same concept applies. Those with the most to lose have the largest voice. 
It really brings the main question that always plagues democracy: Where so we draw the line on voting issues?
I for one am fairly informed on at least a level that allows me to discuss the technical aspects of what's going on, but to say I know the code inside and out would be wrong. There's always the problem of having the underinformed/misinformed swaying decisions that they really have no grounds answering. Democracy works great for simple issues, but the more complex things get, the more democracy seems to break down. 
We do know that money talks though, so perhaps market driven decisions are the best way to do things? It may eventually lead to a mob takeover with uninformed people, but I guess the concept of bitcoin and the code to implement it correctly will always exist. 
I don't really know. This is the same complex problem that has plagued democratic systems from the beginning. They require those voting to be informed on the issues to work correctly, and as things get more complex, that's simply not feasible.

The equipment is almost definitely not paid in full, at least not for enterprise level miners. It is most likely financed, as any large scale money making operation is. And they typically buy electricity contracts with fixed rates for a year, so they will have the same costs, so if they aren't making money, they aren't making money. 
A drop in price low enough would be catastrophic for the large scale miners.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:42:00
Well, it doesn't seem like that hard of a solution to implement what I described then if it isn't already implemented. A POS payment channel.
Wallet A signs a POS transaction to Wallet B with an expiration date of X days, and it is reflected in both wallets as a future commitment. If the transaction is &gt;X days old, it can no longer be confirmed (so as to keep people from holding on confirmed payments for a long period of time). Because the off chain small transaction requires the private key from Wallet A we can assume Person A agrees to the spend. Wallet B then just combines all the spent transactions as inputs into a single output transaction, and pays himself the total when he is ready to settle.
What am I missing here? How much of the transaction size is redundant data, and could encapsulate many other inputs of smaller size into one copy of it? I guess there's always the situation of the person hacking the wallet and having it not register the transaction, and then spend it again, and it would make it a double spend because it wasn't ever broadcast to the network. But for a semi-trust, low risk situation like in person sales of low amounts (coffee), it could be beneficial. Would there be a way to just have a small bit of data included in the blockchain to show the amount has been debited to the account for a future transaction, and would block it from being spent, or would that take up just as much space as a normal transaction.
Because I would say POS transactions are where most people do transactions, which is somewhat of a semi-trust network. Could we implement a semi-trust payment channel for situations where we can reasonably assume that it's not worth it to try and cheat the system?
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:01:47
Not in my opinion. If a group is trying to congregate to control (miners), completely obliterating their ability to do so is the ultimate decentralization. No one is saying they can't run a normal CPU/GPU node just like everyone else.

What in the world are you talking about? It most definitely matters what the consumer thinks in unregulated capitalism... I think you are confusing the system we have in the united states as "capitalism".
It is actually only efficient for companies to monopolize when they increase the barriers to entry substantially higher than feasible. If you have 3 companies that collude to keep the price higher on something, it makes perfect since for someone to come in and undercut them, in exchange for a healthy profit. It is regulated industries where we have all sorts of laws, restrictions, initial equipment investments, etc. etc. that make monopolizing a great option. If you can make it too hard for your competitors to compete, they won't compete.
That's exactly what we see in bitcoin. The barrier to entry is astronomical right now. China rose to significance because they happen to be right in IC never never land and all the infrastructure was right there ready for them. But now they are in a Moore's law predicament, and the consumers are voicing their concern in favor of off chain scaling. They are holding Segwit hostage as long as they can to squeeze the most out as they can, but eventually they are going to have to start selling ASICs to their competitors to remain profitable (loosening their monopoly) and/or others will catch up and be able to beat them out.
Are there short lived monopolies in a free market system? Yes. But the free market aspect of a system allows for people to compete fairly and the monopoly quickly loses it's stronghold.
Jihan Wu has less than 2 years before his hardware is obsolete. And if he pisses off his customers, its going to be even faster than that.
Perfect example of consumer preferences: Blockbuster
Once a (pseudo) monopoly in the movie rental business. Netflix came along and consumer's preferences mattered a whole lot more than Blockbuster's current market position. Now look at Blockbuster. Consumers *are* the market in free market capitalism.

1) Gridlock is good. It means that things are decentralized as they should be. It's a price we pay for decentralization.
2) There will continue to be attacks on bitcoin, and they likely will increase in frequency as the market cap continues to grow
3) This is healthy as it allows for ideas and precautions to be coded and ready to be deployed if the community decides to. 
4) Its possible this stalemate will last for a good long while... Like months longer. Possibly into next year. Whatever it takes to get an emerging consensus.
5) Eventually the Chinese mining monopoly will subside. They created hardware application specific, because they had access to the facilities to do it (chip manufacturing is huge in china). Unfortunately for them, there's something called Moore's law, and they are at it now, which means the equipment is now going to last much longer.
In order to keep making money, they will need to sell hardware as a sure bet on money rather than hope to win more blocks. As that happens, the hardware will be distributed more evenly, and they will lose their major hash advantage. They'll likely always have an edge, but it won't be as much as it is now.
Don't worry. This is growing pains of new technology. It took 15 years for the general public to start using the internet, and 25 before it became commonplace in people's lives. Bitcoin will get there. We aren't ready to be there yet.

Have you seen [this](
You're correct technically. But practically, every service provider, wallet provider, and by far most economic users support Core. So what you are describing, bar some miracle, isn't going to happen. 
In fact the only positive metric BU has to show is their blocks mined metric, which again, in the face of everything else, means nothing. They can mine 100% BU blocks, if the majority of the user base doesn't accept their consensus, it isn't the primary consensus, and won't matter. 
In other words, like 5 people are the only reason BU has any substantial support because of their direct profit motives.

I don't care about short term profits if it comes at the expense of decentralization. And if you do you're an idiot, because the second a nation state or central bank wants to take down bitcoin, the centralized hashing power would be able to do that and it all comes crashing down. 
If you think Ver gives a fuck about you or I, you're a fool. He's financially invested in his own best interest, and if miners control block size, they control transaction speeds, which means they control the fees. They will be the OPEC of bitcoin. Jihan literally already came out and stated that was his goal. Ver is their celebrity spokesperson who is going to get a cut. Go ahead, look up the video of Ver, literally days before the Mt. Gox fiasco, reading off a TelePrompTer that Mt. Gox was solvent. 
Core and the idea of bitcoin are separate. I support Core at the moment because they haven't really shown any reason to make me not support them... they have a solution to the block size. And the malleability problem. 
If they decide to hold bitcoin hostage in the future, as BU is doing now, it is very easy for the population to move away from Core as well.
I don't understand how BU brainwashes you all into believing that anyone who opposes BU is for Core. Most people opposing BU are opposing an already proven to be attack of bitcoin.

You realize sending each of those transactions will cost money right? That's the entire point of a fee market is to economically disincentivize spamming. It would cost a fortune to plug up the blockchain (especially with the extra space created by people using honest hubs) and would get exponentially higher as you tried to increase them beyond reasonable amounts (you'd be outbidding yourself). It's a losing game and wouldn't happen.

Anyone can start up a Segwit Hub or an LN payment channel for very little cost. 
Plus, there's no guarantee that your transactions are anonymous if you go through a third party. In fact, you can almost bet, depending on where that third party is located, it won't be. You think that any reputable company in a country with currently strict regulations (i.e. any industrialized country) is going to just sit back and say "oh well, they got us". Absolutely not. Every spy agency in the world will have a backdoor to these services and due to their centralized nature (being there is someone in charge of maintaining it) they will oblige or risk being sued/jailed/killed.
The best option for real, unadulterated security is with the raw, open source, decentralized platforms available to you using the fundamental functions of the bitcoin protocol, which will soon include LN and Segwit.

I would totally disagree with easily to move, in a relative sense to bitcoin. 
I can have a wallet software on an encrypted thumb drive, and carry it on my keychain everywhere I go, and effectively have my life savings safeguarded wherever I am. Gold and silver sits in a safety deposit box, or in an expensive safe at home, still at risk to being stolen, and if I need to move a large sum, I risk it being confiscated by greedy hands, official or unofficial. 
If you confiscate my flash drive, I just download another wallet software, input my wallet words, and then move my funds to a new wallet, with new words, all within an hour. 
Sure there's advantages to gold, and I don't think that will ever go away, but bitcoin offers some serious advantages over gold. 
Plus bitcoin's total supply is 100% without a doubt limited. Gold on the other hand, is simply an under supplied commodity. More gold can be mined, but we know there's a fixed supply of bitcoin, and we are at an effective no inflation after about 30-40 years. That's something worth noting.

Well a method of measuring user sentiment would even legitimize that statement. If it turns out that 80% of users want Segwit, and only 20% of users want BU, then it exposes them for what they are if they want change, then they will implement more popular solutions. But right now you open the door to shill manipulation and fake news because no one really has any idea of understanding where the user base actually lies. Even if BU knows, clearly their followers don't.

Those who oppose a POW change need to understand that it was never a protected right to be able to create ASICs to control a majority of the hash share. Sure it may have been predicted in Satoshi's white paper, sure we as a whole accepted it because it allowed for the network to become more secure as a whole, but it has *always* remained an option for the users of bitcoin to change the code in any way they see fit.
If the use of ASICs is threatening the hostile takeover of a network by a small group of users because of their massive hash power, it makes sense to render that power useless and re level the playing field. I understand that as a miner who invested thousands if not millions of dollars into this equipment, that may upset you, but understand that ***you*** and ***you alone*** took the risky endeavor of putting all your eggs in one basket. 
The temper tantrum they are throwing is really the realization that the power is no longer solely in their hands, which really is the spirit of Bitcoin. From a technical standpoint, you can classify it as an altcoin all day long, but in the end, "Bitcoin" is the block chain that the majority of users follow, that leads to the original genesis block. If a POW change needs to happen to allow people to use that chain without fear of minority control, then it is a good option. 
Remember, people are drawn to bitcoin because it's a way that promises that absolutely no one has the power to steal your finances if you protect them correctly. No government, no people, no anything. Enacting BU centralizes the power enough that it would be able for the Chinese government could walk in with a gun and have that person do it.
Decentralization isn't necessarily about protecting things from those currently with power. It's about protecting that power from being too big to allow it to be abused by anyone in the first place.

Both are a store of value, but one is backed by literally millennium of years of history of holding value, and one is backed by about 8. About 4 if we are really being honest with ourselves. Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin is much more useful and intrinsically valuable than gold if it retains the trust of people that it holds value. But getting that trust is substantially harder if you can't spend it anywhere. Its just a speculative vehicle at that point.


So we put ourselves in the exact same dichotomy bitcoin was invented to break away from, needing a trusted 3rd party to process the debit card transactions? The bitcoin debit cards are to bridge the likely decades that it will take before people come to fully trust bitcoin, and *all* vendors take it. It offers a way to pay at places that don't support bitcoin, but you are once again beholden to the fees and service conditions that the card offerer lays out.
"Screw the vendors" is saying, "turn bitcoin into any other alt coin"

What the fuck are you talking about? His supply and miners have nothing to do with each other. 
1) If he dumps, it will be bought up very quickly
2) The difficulty can be changed with a single line of code, and decreased back to the level of CPU and GPUs and *many people* from *both sides* would take advantage of that. Miners would be irrelevant with a POWC. The only thing that would happen would be a decrease in the difficulty, which given the strength of SHA256 is already astronomically high to begin with. 
To put things into perspective, that would be like taking 1/10^3000 odds of double spending down to like 1/10^1000. Yes it's a numerically big difference, but it's already "impossible" to begin with so it's irrelevant.

Keep those goalposts still buddy. I even said that we have short term monopolies. 
You originally said that "consumer preferences don't matter in unregulated markets" which is 120% false. Consumer preferences are the *only* thing that matter in *unregulated* markets. And we are seeing that with side chain proposals, the rise of alt coins, and the technical limitations of Moore's law. Jihan may have power right now, but his days are limited, especially if he starts spouting bullshit like this, where they may be limited even more.
If you are trying to draw the capitalism boogeyman scenario to something like what we have in the US, it falls on deaf ears because we don't have capitalism here at all. We had a complicated system of favoritism, where when consumers voice their opinions of wanting something like medical marijuana, it is silenced by drug companies, and still remains federally illegal. Or where utilities are granted a public monopoly, so if you're not happy with your local service/cost, you don't have any other options and just have to deal with it. 
In true free market capitalism, offering the product that best benefits the consumer will always win, and if you can take advantage of economies of scale, you may even be able to do that more so. But if you shit on the consumers, tell them they don't matter, and then expect them to not to react with something like a POW change, you are kidding yourself. 3 months ago a POWC would have been considered far out, and not even considerable. Now there are main developers advocating the coding of and the threat of using it. If Jihan continues this shit, what's to say we don't just get fed up and tell him to fuck himself by implementing it?
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:10:31
Convention methods yes. Any other alt coin, no, which isn't very settling considering the only thing separating bitcoin from any other one is reputation and development. Literally any other alt coin who can have a limited supply, and permanently fix the scaling issue could easily take over. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:02:39
You don't seem to follow. Economies of scale **literally are worthless without aligning with consumer preferences**. My preferences depend nothing on Jihan's monopoly. I can choose to say fuck him because I don't like his face. I'd doesn't matter at all *why* I change my preferences. 
And a POWC would not at all be starting over. It would simply drop the difficulty back down, GPUs would mine again, and things would carry on as normal. We probably would likely never get to the level of hashing we have today, but it's not the hashing that makes bitcoin technologically feasible. It was the encryption that makes it feasible, and that is doable with computers. 
Literally the only thing a high hash rate does is make it economically disadvantageous to try and game the system. But if someone is gaming the system, well then that high rate isn't helping. 
After a POW change we still have all the other BIPs implemented, probably could get Segwit implemented, and the system moves on. Sure investors will spook, and the price would drop substantially, but the purpose of bitcoin isn't a high price. The purpose of bitcoin is a decentralized, open, boarderless, immutable payment system. And the fact that the miners can't unilaterally implement BU is a testament to the fact that we are still overall decentralized. 
If you can't understand that consumer preferences are the only thing that matter in a free market, then we are done here, because that's like the first thing anyone learns in any economics class.   
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:39:51
If you run BU, and support for BU drops off like a rock, then your transaction fees are going to go much lower than any little bit you would lose from segwit.

Doubtful. He's financially invested in BU for whatever reason, so he has a stake in its success. It's basically guaranteed (and he just "confirmed" it) that he's going to flood the market with BTC, which would make the price plummet. There's enough people who see through this nonsense that most of it will be bought up by others. He won't have the chance to buy back his own supply *and* more, *and* keep the price low enough that he wouldn't lose money in the process. 
More likely, he's already cashed out like a 10000% return on his initial investment, so he's risking house money for a quick profit rather than waiting for the long term potential of bitcoin. If BU takes off long enough for bitcoin prices to stay low, ya he could very easily sell off BU and grab more bitcoin, but the way things are looking, BU is going to flop, and most likely not happen in the first place. It's just a power play by the miners, but a potential POWC changes the field and now they are scrambling.

With a BU fork they would be economically incentivized to control the block sizes to just enough to throttle the network, just like OPEC does with oil. If we could have a user base consensus on whether to increase block sizes or not (miners are included in that user base but at an equal vote) then we could accurately judge when it is time to increase block sizes. Users have no incentive to piss of miners that do the payment processing, but they do have an interest in keeping them honest.

Well then we respectfully disagree. History is full of examples where the unsuperior technology is adapted to work and becomes the primary, simply because there's substantial development and changing would mean a loss in productivity (even if only slight). 
Hence why your office computer probably runs Windows when Linux is massively more secure. Because there's already productivity and a userbase and changing it for trivial reasons would be nonsensical. It's possible for a better technology to come along, but it needs to be substantially better. From what I understand the only difference is that it runs on the bitcoin blockchain, which may end up being a detriment if people expect for there to be a fee market for transactions.

Yes you can. If you have a single miner, and over enough time, you mine 2 BTC, you can sell me those 2 BTC.
And what's to stop us from implementing a POW that changes daily? Would it make hash rate substantially lower? Sure. But if we *prefer* 
to have our bitcoins mined in a decentralized fashion, that may be something that we give up. And if we fork off, and run our own little chain, of 50 people, is that not a market? Can 50 people, not run a chain that changes to an entirely random POW on a daily basis, and buy and sell POWCoin? Is that really an impossible scenario? And considering "Bitcoin" was the concept presented in a white paper of a blockchain oriented, decentralized payment method, if enough people preferred for bitcoin to change POW daily, are we somehow not allowed to call our blockchain oriented, decentralized payment method "Bitcoin"? Can we not buy and sell them, and accept them as payment for goods and services? Is that truly an **impossible** proposition? Sure it may *cost* a lot, and I agree, probably wouldn't *align* with people's *preferences*, but you *can not logically* refute that it is a valid possibility. IF you do, we are done here.


No, ifI buy a "conflict free diamond", vs a "non conflict free diamond", I am buying *a diamond that didn't come from a conflict area.* Sure there's documentation to support that, but what I am paying for is the *idea* that the diamond didn't come from conflict. The *documents* aren't what satisfy that. If instead, I flew to Africa, and followed the diamond from when it was dug to when it was cut, to when it was mounted, and it didn't involve any conflict area, than that diamond *is an objectively conflict free diamond* regardless of the paperwork or not. Expensive proposition? Absolutely. But if I *prefer* that, and someone is willing to supply to that preference, there is a market for that. Again, you *can not logically* refute that is a valid possibility.


"Pissing away money" isn't part of the discussion. The discussion is literally *do or do not consumer preferences matter in a market*. If I prefer something decentralized, so heavily that I am willing to pay a higher cost, you *can not logically* refute that there isn't a market for that. Because my *preference* for a decentralized currency *outweighs* my *preference* for a cost effective method.


Again, we would need to POWC. And we could literally POWC on a daily basis, randomly. That is not something that is limited by any market. And IF enough people (only 2 people - a buyer and a seller- are required for a valid market) value decentralization enough, then there is a market for that coin. And thus our preferences *do matter* in the market. We may not be the overwhelming opinion of the rest of the consumers, but you *can not logically* say that our preferences *don't matter in the market*. Because, they irrefutably do. A decentralized coin will get my money over a centralized coin any day regardless of price. And many other people obviously would as well, considering there are efforts to code a POWC and everyone is cognescent that the price will plummet. But the market as a whole will *prefer* a decentralized coin over a high market price, if/when a POWC happens, and you *can not logically* refute that the market's preferences don't matter at that point. Because there will *still be a market*, and miners with hardware at that moment will be standing with their dick in their hands.
I don't think we need to do a daily random POWC to get that either. I think after the first change and a precedent, it won't ever happen again, because so many people will lose enough money to never try it again. And if it does far in the future, they can just POWC again, retaining all the previous history, the idea, all the BIPs up until that point, etc. etc.... It's not "restarting". It's refocusing consumer preferences.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:27:44
A POW change and a reset to GPU level difficulty would probably result in *wider* distribution of mining. I have 3 GPUs sitting on a shelf collecting dust, that I can guarantee you would be put to work tomorrow if they were profitable.
If you gain all the hashing power, and then threaten the rest of the network, bet your ass people are going to change the POW in a fucking heart beat. Nuclear or not. So it sets us back a few years. The idea of a decentralized, open, borderless, immutable, payment and store of value method still exists, and the code exists there to do it. And there's a running understanding that if you try to strong arm the network, the network as a whole will make your investment worthless.

There are ASIC proof algos. 
Also, it's entirely possible the infrastructure is based on credit. Many money making ventures are. As long as you make more than you owe you're solvent. It would make their existing equipment useless while still having a note on it, and they likely couldn't get funding to rebuild such an enterprise. It would be catastrophic for them, no doubt. 
And the free market allowed for them to gain such an advantage, but the free market also allows for the consumers to change their preferences for no other reason than wanting to do so. It's not a free market if one has to use a certain algo just because the powers at be will it. In a free market, the one who takes the risk gets all the reward, and also take all the losses. I'm sorry for the Venezuelans who get caught in the crossfire, but they should have known that an open source software was capable of being changed at any time to make their investment useless. 
As a whole, ASICs have been beneficial to the market by offering security. If they threaten that security though, their power an easily be stricken by a few lines of code.

Gold also has a 320x market cap than bitcoin. It has all the features of gold (and more!) so it isn't unreasonable to compare it to gold. And try to cross the boarder or even drive down the road with a substantial amount of gold. Now do it with bitcoin. 
This is still just like the internet in 1994 on the overall timeline. Most people who have heard of bitcoin have no idea what it is, and most people just plain haven't heard of bitcoin. Internet didn't even start to grab on until early 2000s, and it wasn't mainstream until mid to late 2000s. So ya, there's going to be a lot of rocky ups and downs. But ask the people in Venezuela who's country's currency is inflating at 550% if they think bitcoin is useful. Many of them are feeding their families with it right now. As we say in bitcoin **HODL!** And don't buy more than you are willing to lose. But buy a little now, and watch as it takes off in value over the course of the next few years. Don't fall for alt coins unless you know what you're buying. And overall, enjoy the roller coaster, both the ups and downs.

1) Yes, and no. Yes, bitcoin is in fact being inflated (and yes the value of the overall market is applied to that coin, seemingly out of thin air. That's not how value works). No, because we know the rate of inflation, it is fixed, and we understand there is a fixed total amount, so all of that is taken into account from the market.
2) That inflation becomes effectively 0 in just 36 years. With only 3.5 coins per day being created, that's .006% inflation out of 21M coins. Consider the amount of coins lost in the past, Satoshi's 1M that arguably won't ever be moved, and the amount of coins that will be lost in the future, and we're effectively looking at effectively no more inflation in less than 20 year. Idk about you, but I'm not even close to dying in 36 years.
3) Because the total is fixed at 21M, and that is factored into the equation, lets pretend that does change some time in the future, the value of bitcoin would plummet. It is a fundamental understanding that the amount is fixed and will not ever be changed. The market has that factored in. If you remove that understanding, you leave it open to the amount that can be created, and there's really no reason to use bitcoin over fiat at that point.
If the 21M limit was changed, rest assured bitcoin would go to 0 within a month.

I guess the saving grace is that there will always be the recipe for a completely decentralized store of value, that can work. Even if it doesn't make me rich. 
Honestly, as long as there's a system that can reliably hold value and it can be transferred and isn't at risk of being inflated or frozen by a central authority, I'd be ok with that. Even if that rests at $1 per coin, and runs on GPU miners, it is better than fiat. And in the end that's the goal of bitcoin. I think there's enough people in the world that understand that, that there will be a significant demand for it to serve that purpose.

They can get the crc of all the data blocks as part of the way FileVault fundamentally is designed. It's already calculated. They don't need to recalculate it.

With fees as high as they are now, it would be a losing investment to be trading at such a high volume, just to maintain appearances.
Also, when prices are being artificially held, they are easily spooked. The bitcoin etf is a perfect example of the opposite. Within seconds, it dropped from ~1300 to 1000. It's now back up at almost 1200. That's because people have the faith of it as a value holder and buy it low as a deal. If people had shaky faith (like only a small amount of people holding onto it) they would have dumped as much as they could to capitalize. That flooding of supply would tank the price to sub 200.  That doesn't happen anymore. People "know" that the value of it is far more than 1000 and buy it at a bargain, and demand overwhelms the short term sell off. That's signs of a very healthy asset, not something being propped up. 
I really don't see any reason it wouldn't be worth upwards of $500000 one day. It has absolute scarcity, rather than gold or diamonds which only have relative scarcity. The market cap for gold is about 8T, which if applied to bitcoin would make it $500000. It's pretty much a myth that "gold has other uses" that give it its value. Is gold used in industrial uses? Yes. But it's at such an impurity and trace amount that it may as well be copper. In our digital age, we don't need extremely good conductors, so the amount of gold used in electronics is pretty much non existent now. The $1200/oz price of gold is for gold bullion, which purely has the purpose of storing value. Even with jewelry, you are paying for the craftsmanship of the jeweler, not the actual gold. Buy some gold jewelry, or really anything with diamonds, and then try and get a positive ROI. The only times it happens is if it's an antique Rolex or something, and again, it's purely from the object, not because of its gold. 
Once people realize bitcoin is here to stay (I mean multiple speculation bubbles, a drug dealing eBay, sec and country disapprovals all in 8 years) and watch their dollar dwindle in comparison, and see the advantages over gold (you actually can control it and spend it other than just have it in an etf), to think it's only $1200 right now, is a bargain considering it could easily have the market cap of gold or more.

I don't think there are any really. It's a decentralized, trustless network, and so it depends entirely on game theory. When the actions of a few threaten the actions of a large group, the economic incentive to drive that few away is greater than sitting idle. But everything is driven by economic incentives. We know economically that it is beneficial to work in a group even in an entirely trustless environment. 
So basically there are no "rights". The "rights" are essentially what dives the economic advantage of the whole over just a few. 
My two cents anyways.

Ok, well I feel sorry for you if you sell off your BTC for BTU. 
No one, less the miners, want a centralized coin. Not with the mining cartel, not with blockstream, not with anyone. 
Let McAfee, Jihan, Ver, PBOC and whoever else buy off the mining hash power, but the majority of bitcoin adopters aren't stupid. They see right through this ploy and will just continue on with the BTC chain or just sell off entirely. If BU takes off as the primary chain, I can assure you I will be removing all my money from bitcoin entirely. That would be a disaster.

Anyone can start a hub.
Yes it centralizes transactions on a second level but you always have the option of using the original blockchain and paying full market price, going with another network that offers a faster/cheaper solution, or starting your own. Free market competition will lead to decreased price for consumers. 
The reason we see centralization with the miners is because of the high barrier to entry with mining. Unless you have millions, or mine in an area with cheap electricity, there's no way you can compete effectively. The easier a second layer is to implement, the closer it resembles an economic "pure competition" scenario. At that point, it becomes pure supply and demand.

Jihan is already taking a massive financial risk if they do hard fork. The amount of money required to run that hardware, on a chain that may or may not survive, the risk is huge. I honestly think he's bluffing.
By pumping money in, they are essentially doubling down on that risk. They may sell off BTC quickly and make it look like BTC is failing, but pumping money into BTU would just be stupid, until they are absolutely certain that it is going to work. Otherwise, they are essentially victims of their own pump and dump.
I don't see it happening. I see the risk of a hard fork as a political move, and as the price of BTC continues to drop, it will eventually hit their losing money point. They are just going to hold off in hopes that the continued fees and transaction times are going to switch people over to the BU camp.... That's their only hope.

Right now, consumer preferences prefer the other alternatives to getting Segwit passed, and just waiting for Moore's law to catch up and take away his advantage. 
But if he pushes the envelope, or things don't change, I wouldn't be surprised if consumer preferences favor fucking Jihan over. 
This has absolutely nothing to do with regulated vs unregulated capitalism. In fact, we can thank unregulated capitalism for the reason we even have the opportunity to change our preferences.

I disagree, name one that is immune to customers changing their preferences. 


If demand for gold dropped significantly, and the cost to run the equipment was no longer viable, yes you can bet the companies will pursue other forms of revenue. And in doing so, that will include liquidating assets. I have heavy investments in Phillip Morris. You think they are just rolling over because tobacco is on the decline and marijuana and vaping is on the rise? They either adapt to consumer preferences or they die. 


You are taking for granted that consumer preferences can and do change. Especially when they have a choice and are knowingly coerced. Why do you think bitcoin is taking off? A few central banks have had a monopoly on currency insurance, yet here we are creating a currency rising in value as more and more people adopt it. Telephone companies? People weren't forced to just deal with expensive land line transmission of voice calling when services like vonage and magic jack could do it for a quarter of the cost.
I work for the oil and gas/energy industry. Do you think we are just standing by idle while renewables become a reality? You can bet your ass that we are constantly looking for more efficient methods, and experimenting with renewables on a daily basis, but they just aren't monetarily viable at the moment. But if you think these multibillion dollar operations are just standing by waiting to die off, you're lying to yourself. "BP" is going to be just another moniker along with "ATT" when they adjust to the inevitable trend of renewables. 
History is filled with situations where monopolies were created with the help of regulations, yet consumer preferences shifted and the monopolies were forced to adapt.

Honestly I think it's a healthy exercise. Whether or not this is a hostile takeover by a state authority (sure feels like it) or a stalemate based off of genuine concerns and misunderstanding from both sides, people are formulating solutions both drastic and moderate.
I'm on mobile right now, but Andreas has a great video he did back a couple days ago about decentralization and governance. He basically talks about how gridlock is a price to pay for a truly decentralized network, and it's times like this that show exactly how little power anyone has to singlehandedly make change. A line that sticks out is (paraphrased) "people operate on blockchains to make money, and if your opinion gets too loud, people let you go on your way, and you no longer make any money. So either you work together to find a solution people will adopt as a whole, or you don't make any more money".
There's solid points coming from both camps, and it's a good time to realize how centralized this network has become and the dangers of that centralization (if the Bitmain did control the blocksizes, what's to stop a Chinese government takeover of Bitmain?). By realizing this and protecting it both from developers and miners centralizing, we'll end up with a healthy, decentralized network again. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:50:33
[I am...](
The fact that BU has only 12% of nodes, and 39% of the blocks mined for them is proof that it is almost entirely consisting of the miners. If they want to fork off, good riddance. We'll just lower the difficulty to a GPU friendly level, change POW algorithm to possibly include CPU functions and carry on. I wish them the best in their "SuperHashPowerCoin". A high hash power means nothing if it isn't decentralized.
The only reason a large hash power makes the network more *safe* is because it increases the cost for someone to make a 51% attack. But if those with the most power are congregating to the ability to make a 51% attack, well then it doesn't really do much good to have a ton of hash power....
BU keeps posting graphs of blocks mined because it looks like it is getting adopted more and more, but in reality, its just a further concentration of hash power. If your nodes don't increase proportionately, then the number of people signaling clearly isn't either.

If anything, it realigns bitcoin with the original idea, a maximally decentralized bitcoin network. If one person tries to cheat, it gets rejected by the rest of the network.
Leveling the playing field to include those who have been butted out by the creation of ASICs works towards that goal of massive decentralization. Right now, the user base has basically no voice in the fight against a hard fork. That's not the original idea of bitcoin.

People don't have to follow up on their word. The understanding of the perception of the public to your actions is enough to keep things in check. No one would hard fork if they knew the community wouldn't follow.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, and I agree it makes people much more skeptical in investing in hardware with a precedent of changing. 
What I meant by "going back to 2009" was more resetting the ideological aspect of bitcoin to what it was in 2009. Essentially saying "we know what the outcome of ASICs are, therefore we will chose to avoid them in the future". It refocuses the goal on a decentralized currency, rather than just the one with the most hash power. But make no mistake, the hash power, and probably the financial backing would drop to 2009 levels. Fortunately the decentralized idea of bitcoin is what drew people to it to begin with, and it will continue to draw people to it in the future, even if there is a high hash rate counter part that is highly centralized." 
"Bitcoin" is an idea. You can't kill an idea. You can hijack the implementation, but the idea and lessons learned remain.

Most alts now days are experimenting with actual use cases, and extending the idea of blockchain technologies beyond payment systems, approaching a web 3.0 model. The creativity and ingenuity coming out of certain spheres are their value.
I don't see it as a threat. As we progress further, and this industry matures, we will see different crypto coins service more specific purposes, and over time, the entire market cap of the space will grow. $25B is still minuscule in terms of the overall economy. It's hardly a blip on the radar. Bitcoin has proven to be a useful for a store and transfer of value, and it has properties that support that quite well. A capped, very scarce (only 21M for a population of 7B+ people), and extremely secure transfer method, still extremely fast, cheap, and private in relation to any other methods out there.
Bitcoin doesn't have to be superman. It can identify itself as a single purpose, and other coins can pick up the slack elsewhere. File space coins, identity coins, decentralized programming coins, etc. etc. all are coins dedicated to specific tasks, and some of the rising stars do their tasks quite well.
Gone are the days of 2013, where everyone wanted to just make "the next bitcoin" and were essentially just making clones of bitcoin, for the same purpose, with a slight change, or no change at all. Now we are seeing the free market thrive, and people are coming up with thousands of different ideas and applying them to the overall industry sphere.
When you think about the entire amount of value store in the world, the upside price of Bitcoin is still absolutely massive compared to what it is now. But the upside price of many other coins, in their own sector is also high. It's not industrial cannibalism as the short sighted would believe.
We're just shifting capital around in the short term, to further develop the space. The upside potential isn't decreased with alt coins. The upside total market cap of all crypto coins is increased as a whole, because the sphere just got better at doing a whole lot more things more efficiently.
In the short term, will we see market share fleeing from bitcoin? Absolutely. In the long term, will we see the overall tide rise? Yes. Astronomically in fact.  
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:25:04
I'd totally agree with that. I was out of the loop for a couple years, just holding what I had from 2014 until recently when I needed to transfer funds. I had fees at a minimum because no one likes fees, only to have the $800 or so stuck in limbo until I paid a mining pool to include the transfer in the next block for astronomical fees. 
My first reaction was panic, and the first solution I saw was bitcoin unlimited. It wasn't until I started looking at the solutions and problems with each that I realized I was being duped on an unsavory circumstance. If I wouldn't have put in the time to research and get back up to speed, I'd probably be in the BU camp too.

But we can all agree the original idea behind POW was compromised the second ASICs joined in. The original idea was "one CPU, one vote". Introducing something that has to have a CPU (logical driven not arithmetically driven) returns that original sentiment.

Andreas Antonopoulos had a talk a few days ago about decentralization and it is very informative. I'm on mobile or I would link it but I think it was 3/14 and it's on his YouTube page. 
Basically, he says that the gridlock we are in is a sign of decentralization, in that no one person can make any decisions solely. It may be more centralized right now than we expected, but with both sides of the argument targeting *some* source of centralization, it makes sense that any compromise would likely result in decentralization of both. This is pretty healthy in my opinion. Bit of a wake up call for everyone as to how things can get centralized without even trying.

Ok, that makes sense, but is there not a way to modify the transaction data for this specific type (semi-trust), to a stripped down version that takes up less space?
For example, the regular transaction would require 3 things to truly make it secure, which is the originating inputs, the signature to spend those inputs, and then the output address. There's all sorts of other information included in those transactions are there not? Is it possible to strip it down to the essentials, and then create one combined transaction that takes up a net less amount of space?
I guess the way I'm thinking is if I have a server to backup 3 computers, and all computers have the exact same file A, really I only need to reference file A in all three backups, and it can just be on the server once, so I only use slightly more than 33% of what I would have (1 file and 3 links rather than 3 files). 
No obviously, this wouldn't be 100% trustless on the POS side because technically the payer's wallet could be modified to not recognize such a transaction and just double spend. But for low risk scenarios (Joe probably will just tell the customer he's calling the police if the double spender comes in again, and he's only out the cost of the coffee, no different from a chargeback scenario they currently deal with) it would be sufficient. And from a payer's perspective, it is 100% secure because the modified transaction wouldn't be valid without their signature, which if they don't have full control over, anyone could spend their coins anyways. 
I understand that lightning network doesn't work this way, but from my understanding, LN is still 100% trustless. There's many scenarios in life where transactions are semi trustless, and it is worth it for the seller to take that small risk in exchange for increased customer satisfaction. 
If such a transaction method existed, you could accept instant transactions immediately, at very low cost, which is essentially the essence of the coffee problem everyone is relating this blocksizing problem to. It could be as simple as a check on the network to ensure said address actually has the funds they say they do, and even better if somehow they can be deducted (removed from the overall count of bitcoins) until a redeemable input can make claim to them again. Essentially you would just remove the coins from existence entirely (since they really are just numbers in a ledger), removing them from the possibility of being double spent, until a future transaction references that hold on coins later, even if it is off chain until that happens. 
Idk, just brainstorming here.

What are you talking about?
I conceded plenty of times to not even knowing what Rootstock is. But I do understand that first to market makes a huge difference, and from the way he described it, it is essentially ethereum, so I made a case that I don't believe it will overtake it. Nothing I said was factually wrong. In the end we are speculating anyways.
Edit: If you didn't notice, this discussion has continued on other comment chains. He shotgun replied to me, and this was the last comment so I pretty much just blew it off cause I had expressed my point in the other chains. But thanks for getting involved.
Edit 2: also, since we are speculating entirely, no one can be right or wrong. So I really can't be in over my head in this situation, in the context of this discussion.

Does the lightning transaction not create its own separate output that could be used as an input into any normal transaction?
If it does, and he sells 800 coffees, why can't he just write a transaction at the end of the day with the 800 locally stored outputs all as inputs into a transaction paying himself for the total?
Genuinely asking, I was under the assumption a LN output was the same as any other transaction output in terms of being used for a transaction. 
And yes, Joe would need to front up $1.50 for each of those 800 transactions, but considering with cc processing, a 3% charge would result in a $36 charge for the day. Instead, he can just keep a stash of money to be able to cover the amount he's encumbered for every transaction. If it's a busier day, he can ways just run true up on chain any time he's low on money.
I'm talking about 800 different people all spending separate $1.50 transactions with Joe. They may or may not ever return to his shop, so a gift card wouldn't apply in this scenario. And most companies already use open accounts with each other, but they depend on credit rather than being able to work with funds like in bitcoin.

It can be "updated" all day long, but if it isn't updated in a way that removes the vulnerability in question (skip to the conclusion it hasn't) then your point is still irrelevant.
The fact that they can access the crc32 checksum (hash) is still the point of concern (p. 353). 
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:34:40
No, bitcoin belongs to the user base, and the user base has spoken that they don't want BU otherwise it would be adopted. 
If they want to change it, and they honestly believe it is better, great, the code is there and ready to be done up however they want. But to force change upon those who don't want it isn't ok. That's stealing. 
That applies for Segwit as well. It just so happens that when the few people causing issues begin to leave, Segwit will most likely be overwhelmingly be adopted.

It makes all the difference in the world 1 vs 21M vs more than 21M. 
The difference is if we go from 1 to 2, and I own .5, I now effectively own .25 of the market. Whoever got the extra bitcoin got that value stolen directly from me. 
If we divide further than 8 decimal places, no matter how many decimal places you go back, you don't affect the value of the actual coin.
So once again, the total supply of coins is most definitely an important factor. 21M coins is bitcoin. Anything with more or less is not bitcoin. End of story.

"Bitcoin" is whatever chain from the original genesis block users accept Bitcoin to be. I don't think it would be too hard to convince users to use a chain where they actually have a voice, and aren't held at the whims of billionaires controlling 95% of the hashing.
If/When BU forks off, it will fail if BTC changes its POW. The users, and what they buy with it gives it value. The only way BU succeeds is if the miners are able to manipulate BTC enough to cause mayhem with massive hash power and cause it to fail. Change POW you make that basically impossible. BU will tank like a rock.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:50:40
I want to have a say, as a user of bitcoin, in the decisions, just as the idea was initially conceptualized. And there shouldn't be a $500M barrier to entry to make such a decision.
New POW, everyone has an even vote. Then we can all decide whether we like Core's code or not. If not, we don't run it.
Do you honestly think BU is a step *away* from centralization?
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:48:15
I agree, I think a POWA should be considered even without a split. It's not fair to honest miners (although in the free market, they made the decision in free will) to just make their investments obsolete, when we consider the value a high hash rate brings to the table. The problem, is that a high hash rate is only valuable if that hash rate is distributed, otherwise, it becomes the same issue as a low hashrate with one person having more advantage. 
The purpose of hashing is the POW to distribute the consensus to those who put economic resources at risk. If you are putting electricity and capital on the line, you are less likely to cheat, at least in basic game theory. But as we are seeing play out, even though they are *less likely to*, they still *are* by combining resources. It's just like a stand off with guns vs a standoff with nukes. Doesn't matter how much firepower is involved, if everyone dies. A POWA can be done with a SF and would simply balance the centralization of hashing power with equal CPU power. It's going to be significantly more expensive to centralize CPU power. You also don't lose the advantage of a high hash rate.

You seem to be getting value caught up with somehow the cost to produce something. That's not how market value is found. Market value is found with a balance of supply and demand. The "cost to produce" is included in the supply, but it isn't the only factor.
Gold is a perfect example. Gold isn't in the "upper hundreds" it costs around [$1250]( per troy ounce. Cost to produce is about [$400]( Considering I can hold 30 pennines (400/1250=~30%) in one hand, ya, I would call that pennies on the dollar. so I do, in fact have my "facts straight".


Ok, but there's only one bitcoin. There's hundreds knock of iPhones, does that make an iPhone worth less?


Andreas Antonopoulos describes it much better than I can... He has longer more serious talks about this subject if you are truly interested but I figure [this]( serves our purposes fine enough for now.


Ya no its not. Seriously, listen to Andreas talk, he does a couple like hour long talks about the topic. The reason there's a draw to bitcoin is because it *isn't* the banks. That is fundamentally opposing bitcoin.


Well no one isn't saying it isn't risky. But after 8 years, a couple exchange hacks, a media hype bubble, a drug dealer eBay, and SEC decision against it, and the potential of a hard fork in the coming months, and its *still* above $1000? I'd say your leg to stand on saying "it could crash any day" is getting a little old. Google any article on bitcoin from 2014, and then take a step back and realize we're still here (hi mom!), and just reached an ATH price last month.


You need to do some research before you just give some strangers on the internet your money. Yes, there's plenty of other Alt coins. No, it couldn't have been *any other* coin. They aren't all created equal. Ethereum is a Turing complete programming language, that has major companies like Microsoft, JP Morgan, BP, etc. interested in helping develop it (google EEA). Some of the smartest minds in the industry are working on it. There's something called "human capital", and it can literally make or break a project. Ethereum has some very smart people working on it, and more importantly, some very smart people *using* it for its designed purpose.
Saying it could have been any of them is like missing Apple, because it could have been *any* computer company. You missed the fact that Jobs and Woz are special people capable of making it happen.


Well all you have to do is ask nicely :)
You don't necessarily need to be a programmer. Yes it helps, but it isn't required. You're still pretty early on, so things are still going to be pretty technical, but they are much better than they used to. To start, watch a lot of Andreas's youtube videos, he really has a gift for explaining things. Then he has two level books "Internet of Money" geared more towards non technical people explaining bitcoin, and "Mastering Bitcoin" if you are really interested in the nitty gritty of it.
But the fact that it is open source is the reason you shouldn't necessarily worry. There's hundreds of (probably highly paid) people dedicating their time and effort *for free* for the success of the project, so they are essentially doing the dirty work for you. Sure, its always safer if you do it, but just like you can trust a doctor or a mechanic, you can trust the people who are working on something open source, in that if something was wrong *someone* would find it.
And from the "price dropping"... Oh boy you have a while to go. If I sold everytime the price "dropped" I'd be broke. I rode it all the way down from $600 in 2014. I bought a good bit more at around $200. It has risen and dropped numerous times over that time, but everyone who is in the bitcoin game now nows to just hold. This is like the internet in the early 90s. There's going to be rough patches, people are going to get scared and sell, but I can tell you just by holding on, I've made back many times return on my money, in both ethereum and bitcoin. Buy and hold. This is a long term game. If you sell within a year you are probably doing it wrong. In 2 months time it could be $1300 or higher and you'll be wishing you bought it now. Or it could be $300 and you could be glad you didn't buy it now. Don't buy more than you can afford to lose, and just be happy with the gains you get.


You are right that there's no number to call. You are not right in there's no legitimacy in it. If you have a wad of cash under your mattress and someone steals it, who are you going to call? If you said the police, well they're gonna do about as much as would happen if you told them they stole bitcoin. Write a report, and if you have it insured, that report can be given to insurance. That's it. Yes, YOU are in charge of keeping it safe.
Luckily, its really not that hard anymore. Smart people have made it as simple as memorizing, or coding 12 words into a story in a way only you know the words. And you can recover that anywhere that has a wallet that has the same format (most have the same format). And if you are worried about someone guessing/cracking those 12 words, don't. They have a number of possibilities is 2048^12 = 5.44 x 10^39 chance of getting your wallet words (not enough energy in the universe to power a computer to do that).
Yes, it is entirely moronic to keep your bitcoin in a place like coinbase. And yes, unless you have the private keys you don't own it. Digital wallets are free (google multibit or go to the bitcoin.org website and find a wallet from there... There's quite a few, all free, all safe, all easy to use.) I happen to use a hardware wallet (keepkey) because I have a substantial amount, so my keepkey stays in a secure place, and I still have wallet words where I can recover the funds/move it if it ever gets stolen, before anyone could ever crack the combination to it.
tl;dr- You don't have to lash out at those using technology you don't understand. Chances are, in a decade or so, you'll be using bitcoin whether you know it or not, in some form or another, because bitcoin is a core protocol (like TCP/IP). You don't need to know packet switching to use the internet do you? If you buy some now, chances are, it's going to be worth much more than it is today. And yes, there's entirely the chance it goes to zero, but after 8 years, it's looking pretty good.
From a pure speculation standpoint, gold has an 8T market cap. Bitcoin has a 18B market cap. If you apply even 10% of gold's market cap to the amount of bitcoins today, you'd get $100k per bitcoin. 5%, is 50K per bitcoin. Just assume for a second that bitcoin is as safe as people think (it is, again 8 years and every hacker worth their salt has tried to hack it), do you really think 5% of gold is unobtainable in the future?

Planting evidence is one thing.
The accusation is that there's CP on his drives. Matching hashes proves that. How they got there is still up for debate and he may likely use that as an excuse. 
Then he just needs to figure out how to avoid testimony from his *sister* who will testify under oath that he showed it to her (and thus was aware of it and didn't report it then as planted.)

I'm not an expert on the topic by any means, but reading the [proposal thread]( there are some ideas being thrown around about a "second layer" of POW, that would be CPU intensive, which would make it an even playing field for just about anyone to play a role in the mining operation. Hashing would still be needed, and would represent most of the reward, but hashing alone wouldn't be sufficient. This reintroduces the ability for the user base to have a say, and neither would be able to mine blocks without the other, balancing and decentralizing without killing anyone's operation totally.
Seems like a fair compromise if their goal isn't to control the whole network (which we can all agree is bad).

The value is world wide though, so what people do with it in the US has little bearing on the value when people in Venezuela are literally depending on it to buy food. Especially if the people using it for nefarious purposes are just using it as a medium of exchange and not holding. 
I'd argue, it's entirely based on the long term hodlers and those in places of hyperinflation (or looming hyperinflation) who are raising the price. The going rate for an once of weed isn't rising with bitcoin, no matter how many people buy it with bitcoin, so the amount of bitcoin in terms of overall volume being used to buy drugs is shrinking everyday that bitcoin grows in value.

All the services have already come out and said they default to core unless there is a major selloff. 
So effectively, unless those people actively switch, they will default be using the core chain. Just because hash power switches over doesn't automatically mean wallets and exchanges will too. 
Make no mistake, BU is an altcoin until it can prove otherwise. And the industry will treat it as such. And no one in their right mind would support buggy code, a head miner, and a bunch of billionaire manipulators. A HF is just going to be the death of BU. I really hope we just come to consensus on how to change POW and then I welcome a hard fork. Good riddance. Fix the centralization that never should have happened to begin with.

I can't even have a logical conversation with you because you clearly don't understand the fundamentals of economics. *Preference in a free market is the* ***only*** *thing that matters*. Period. Preference by definition = demand. If you refute, that, you may as well be saying 2+2 = 5. Bitcoin was centralized because we decided *to change* our preferences from being completely decentralized to somewhat centralized in exchange for usability. If we don't like the outcome, we can realize that, and just *change* our preferences again to decentralization, and the suppliers will follow suit.
Example: If you've never had a mango, but you are interested in trying one, and I am selling one, that interest would be a change in your preferences. Prior to learning to what a mango was, you didn't have a preference for it. After learning of a mango, you would *prefer* to try one, and thus a market demand is created. If you don't *prefer* to try a mango, I can't just force you to buy from me. My business depends on satisfying your demand. If the whole world doesn't like mangos, my mango business is worthless. You may like the taste of a mango, and your *preferences* stay to buying mangos. Actually, the whole country likes mangos, so I start mass producing them, taking advantage of economies of scale. Then, tomorrow, it is found out mangos cause cancer. Are you now doomed to deal with buying mangos from me forever? No, you and the rest of the country will now *prefer* not to buy a cancer causing food. What happens to my mango farm and equipment? It is worthless, because I invested in something the market no longer wants. It doesn't matter how much I try and push mangos, or try to modify them, if people know that mangos cause cancer, they prefer to not buy them.
We can prefer to remain decentralized, and cause an entirely logic (hell even captcha based) POW, and if someone wants to maximize on that, we keep changing the POW until miners realize that we will not tolerate centralization. We aren't "restarting" or "rebuilding" we are normalizing. We still have all the BIPs, we would still have Segwit coded, we would still have the faith that bitcoin still can't be cracked, everything stays the same except there is a strong precedent for decentralization.
WE AREN'T REINVENTING ANYTHING. Bitcoin is still there. The 8 years of development are still there. So the market value may go down, but that's not starting anything over. No where is there a stated purpose of bitcoin for a high market value. And yes, its entirely possible that without centralization, the market isn't feasible for normal people to use, and its market value is in the toilet. But if there is a preference, there is *by fucking definition* a market demand for that, and the only way to profit off of it is to supply that demand.
The fact that you don't believe preference in a market matters tells me you have absolutely no understanding of basic economics in any regard. The existence of preference is literally what makes a free market. A free market can't exist *without* it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:07:44
It's also completely within the free unregulated market for consumers to completely change their preferences with no other warrant than simply wanting to.
There's no reason we can't change POW just because we want to decentralize power.

Ehhh, that's not exactly how doubling economically works. There wouldn't be double the wealth in the ecosystem, you would essentially be just halving the value of each coin. As people migrate more and more towards another coin, the value of the other coin will plummet. *If* you were are able to sell off enough to make some money, effectively you will just be beating the next guy to the bank in a bank rush essentially. Not that you should feel bad for it, but understand there's going to be a lot of winners and an equal amount of losers in a split. All depending on who can sell what first. A split isn't going to be good.

I agree, but Bitcoin doesn't have to do everything. It's ok to modularize. What's wrong with ethereum filling the void for dapps an bitcoin filling the void for value store, and maybe another one along the line doing something else?

They want to make the knee jerk reaction of increasing the block size, which does nothing except set up further centralization. The bigger the block, the bigger the pools need to be to calculate the block.
To put things into perspective, just a couple days ago, someone hacked their code and turned off like half the nodes running BU... Imagine if bitcoin was handling the world economy, the chaos that would ensue if someone could deactivate half the network, knowing you only need 51% of hashing power to hijack the network.

Just because it's based off the bitcoin blockchain doesn't mean it is first to market. 
The actual service has to be first to market. If people aren't using rootstock at the time of its release, it depends on attracting those who would make use of that service. If they are already implementing on ETH, there would need to be a major incentive to stop their work on ETH and rework, reapply their time and resources to work on rootstock. I'm not saying that's impossible. I'm saying it's highly unlikely. 
Bitcoin was first to market on a POW based store/transfer of value system. That doesn't mean every software written on top of it is now first to their own market by default. ETH and BTC serve entirely different purposes, and as such they are entirely different markets.

Are you mentally retarded? Because I feel bad about arguing with you if you're handicapped.
My original point was that Jihan's main goal is an OPEC style cartel over bitcoin and it's fees. He's not interested in the long term potential. I never said that I don't believe LN and Segwit, and other protocols would be more valuable. I said his goal is to profit off of something feasible *tomorrow*. Ever hear the expression "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"? Because that literally describes this situation. 
To that you replied that it was nonsense and that I somehow fundamentally don't understand bitcoin. My "case and point" is he literally said he's trying to do, exactly what I said he was trying to do. 
Never once did I say it was the best option. But when presented with the opportunity to monopolize or wait for future gains, it's fundamental to any business decision that you profit on guarantees. Maybe you don't have much business experience with multimillion dollar operations in BMX, but as someone who works in oil and gas, I see decisions like this all day long. Does renewable energy offer a better long term potential? Obviously. But right now 99% of funding is for natural gas because it is profitable tomorrow. We'll deal with renewables when that presents a profitable option.
I understand completely how bitcoin works. Both technically and economically. And the fact that I was able to literally spell out his plan *before* he verbatim revealed it should show you that. But you're too much of a pompous ass who can't comprehend the concept of being wrong and how that doesn't directly translate to someone being uneducated that you can't see past your own pride. 
I never said you don't understand bitcoin. I said you were missing the big picture. Case and point from the link above. You're the one throwing accusations of the lack of understanding based off some reddit karma nonsense, but if you go through my history in the past few days, you can realize that although I've been dormant in I do in fact understand the fundamentals of bitcoin better than many. You really need to take some logic classes and realize your logical fallacies don't neglect your requirement to actually objectively prove your argument. This isn't a court room. There is no "burden of proof". This is a discussion forum, and as such if you have an opinion, you must be able to back it up objectively, and not just point at your reddit karma and run away thinking you are right. 
You thought I was supporting BU from the beginning so you just assumed I was wrong. In fact, I was simply agreeing with you, but stating that BU was stupid for different reasons. As "proved" in the link above.

Well one will be focused around a coin that actively fought centralization from miners (even if it currently has centralization from the developers, there's a precedent of breaking away from centralizing powers who abuse that power) and one will have a focus on maintaining value based off purely hash power. Once people see through the facade and realize the original draw to bitcoin was decentralization, the decentralized coin will win. 
That doesn't mean an extremely high hash rate coin is worthless. But if we are talking about a value store, incapable of any force stealing that value (without your private keys) then the decentralized coin will win. It may take years, it may take dacades, and BU may retain a significant value, but the fact can't be ignored that the value of bitcoin is truly rooted in its decentralization.

DA: shittysite.com yadda yadda
Me: right click, save file as, run checksum, get different value. "Your honor, I move to dismiss this evidence under grounds I have just proved the DA has been tampering with evidence by changing the file. We can clearly see that comparing this to the source image, it is a different checksum than that on the hard drive, and that of what the DA is using."
CP pervert gets off. 
Your last accusation doesn't hold water. It entirely depends on the ability to tamper with the source file, which is easily provable to have happened. The article doesn't state how they compared checksums, so we are both speculating now. But given that they are *fucking professionals, likely hired as a subcontractor, and thus have a reputation to defend*, they already know, through the internet logs, what sites and pages he's been on. They "know" the images that are there. They run a watermarking attack, simply grabbing those files straight from the source website, and prove, *all in front of a jury* that it is impossible for it to be a different file. 
Checkmate buddy. Nice try.

Never heard of it. But I have a feeling first to mobilize in any particular area will continually win out. Ethereum was the first to seriously mobilize and capture investor eyes, so it will likely win out. Anything else is just a wannabe clone, like all the "next bitcoin" coins we saw in 2013 trying to capitalize off those who felt they missed the early bus, but never had anything new to offer.

Have you seen 99 pennies? You can't hold 99 pennies in your hand. 
And ok, sure. I concede, 30 cents for every dollar may not be "pennies on the dollar", although there's really no formal definition of it, so we're really just speculating here anyways. But playing semantic games and attacking irrelevant points doesn't undermine the original argument:
The price of gold has nothing to do with the cost it takes to produce it. It has everything to do with the scarcity of it, and the historical significance we give it as a value store.
No amount of attacking the colloquial expression I use to portray that point will change the underlying sentiment. I backed my claim up by showing the price of gold and the cost to produce. If you disagree, the burden of proof is now on you. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:40:58
Can we place a bet on it then? Put your money where your mouth is.
Also, you do understand that gold backed money (i.e. fixed supply money) is the only currency that has succeeded for thousands of years.
[The USD has literally inflated 2000%+ in less than 100 years.](
And they already did make a movie, called "The Rise and Rise" of bitcoin, where they followed it all the way from &lt;$.0001 to over 1100, to the crash in 2014, and left it there... Now its 2017 and our median cost over time is almost $1200. But hey if you adopt today, you're still an early adopter. You don't even have to buy a full bitcoin. They divide by 8 decimal places.
Don't say you were never informed.
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:54:21
You realize gold costs pennies on the dollar to produce right? And that the industrial uses for gold don't even come close to the amount of gold we actually have. 
The only thing that gives gold value is that you can buy it, and expect to get a significant portion if not all of it back, based on historical significance. If I can buy a bitcoin today, and expect to get a significant portion if not all of it back, what makes that any different. 
It's scarcity is what gives it value. The multi billion dollars worth of dedicated hardware infrastructure gives it value. The fact that in the same time bitcoin has been alive (8 years now) the dollars buying power has halved gives it value. 
Again, either put your money where your mouth is, or get lost. Let's wager, or you're just trolling.

Blocks mined is irrelevant. In fact the only relevance it has is that the only people supporting it are mega miners. Nodes make up consensus, not hash power. 
They can literally have 100% of the hash rate, but if they mine blocks that the rest of the nodes don't support, they are just hard forking off. 
I agree Segwit isn't getting 95%, but a UASF is already being implemented, and if the majority of [nodes]( support it, then it is activated and miners who don't conform can just go on their own chain. 
There's a reason BU keeps showing the block rate, it's because it's the only thing that makes it look like they are winning. But if you understand how bitcoin works, every other piece of data shows they are losing. Badly in fact. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:19:19
If you are a *proponent* of BU, then you accept everything that goes along with it. 
You can oppose Segwit (although I'm not exactly sure what the legitimate reason to do so at this point is) without supporting BU. 
By supporting BU, you are subscribing to the exact thing that is wrong with American politics. Turning a multifaceted, complex situation into something that can be judged on a 1D object such as a line. There's no "left or right", but there is "correct and incorrect", and so far, BU supporters have shown to be objectively incorrect in everything they justify their position with. So in that regard, the "us" vs "them" is more, BU (i.e., everyone who cannot see the glaring technical flaws) and everyone else. 
Whatever solution you support, could be drastically different than Segwit, but if it aligns with BU, chances are you are objectively wrong.

Centralization is bad because it opens the door for anyone (including a malicious state) to control bitcoin.
Just like when Trump was elected, and people freaked about a maniac being in charge of all the power that was successively given to those before him... Had that power not existed in the first place, you wouldn't have to worry. 
Literally, the ***entire*** point of bitcoin is a decentralized trust less network. If you centralize it and place trust in a party, you no longer have "bitcoin", you have a hijacked network that originated from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:10:46

@_date: 2017-03-29 15:56:31
Ok, fair enough, you are correct on that, but the point I was making was that just because something costs a lot does not mean it *has* to cost a lot to produce. Your example includes the assumption that there's an unlimited amount that can be supplied, and cost is the only barrier. In other words, if it cost less, you could produce more. Yes that is true for gold. 
That isn't the case with bitcoin. Bitcoin supply is mathematically limited. So whether it costs $2 to produce, or $200 to produce, the price (from a market perspective) is only focused on the total amount that will be created. If someone makes some astronomical discovery that they can hash at 5x the normal speed tomorrow, at the next difficulty increase, it gets reset, and we are back to a predictable supply that can't be produced faster (thus flooding the market with cheap bitcoin). 
The cost of production for oil and gold are not good comparisons to bitcoin. They are selectively limited in production, in order to keep price high (artificial supply control). Bitcoin, that's not the case. 12.5 bitcoin will be created every 10 minutes give or take, no matter the cost to produce. This is constantly recalibrate to be held true no matter what parties try to manipulate it.

Right. I have no problem with critical thinking and not just blindly accepting expert opinions either, but to try and offer your opinion to a problem that you don't even understand the underlying solutions for is just dangerous as a whole.
I don't claim to be a bitcoin expert at all, but I know where my technical understanding stops, and when I need to research something further before voicing my opinion on it. I guess the point I'm trying to say is to know your limit and understand that if you try and stretch beyond it, you're doing more harm than good.

With level 2 implementations, the blockchain backlog decreases substantially. When/if it fills up again, *then* we hard fork to a larger block size. If Core refuses, we just move on without them. How is that such a hard concept for BU to understand.

That's the point, no one is "worried", but because a few assholes (mega miners like Jihan Wu) have publicly stated they aren't going to support Segwit because off chain transactions would hurt their profits, they have the hashpower to effectively stop the normal process where things like Segwit can be created. Thus people are coming up with backup options for situations like this. This is really the first time bitcoin has been strong-armed, and it's taking time to adjust. 
A Fork is just going to cause massive confusion and value drop across the board. That's not beneficial to anyone. 
If anyone is worried about anything, it's that after they fork, they are going to maliciously use their excess hash power to attack the original chain making it look like it's failing. This isn't speculation, Gavin Anderson, Wu and others have openly talked about this. Again, and attack is going to just look Sergio for bitcoin, so things like a POW change are being explored. 
Uncertainty isn't good for markets and people are rightfully worried about what's going to happen to their savings because a few assholes want to draft of conspiracy theories to attack an existing chain, using the easiest reason available (high fees) to appeal to the uneducated masses. If anyone is "worried" it's because of the short term just like you'd be worried if it was found that China was hacking into the Nasdaq and manipulating things.

Most likely they can't get the coins out of cold storage because of the network bog (they claim 95% of their coins are cold storage) and everyone is just trying to pull the coins out at the same time.

Half the nodes crashed because of two separate bugs found within 2 weeks of each other. That's inexcusable for a network this big now. 
Core may have had its issues early on too, but they are solved in time for a much larger market. If BU wants to take the baton, it better be as tight as Core and then more. But it's not as proven. 
And the "evolving" bitcoin you are talking about has the possibility of increasing the cap from 21M to "compensate miners" as the block rewards decrease. That's not bitcoin, that's miner coin. I'm on mobile, otherwise I'd link to the video, but a BU developer literally said that increasing the total amount of coins isn't off the table in the future.

If the group as a whole decides we want things decentralized, there's no reason we can't have that. Economies of scale are 100% dependent of consumer preferences.
Does that mean we give up stability? Sure, I never said it didn't. This is reality and there are trade offs. 
But this entire discussion was driven from your claim that free market systems always devolve into monopolies and we are doomed to be coerced. I'm sorry the socialist mindset has gotten to you, but the free market system, when presented with technologies feasible to break through existing regulations or completely unfettered by regulations to begin with, always allows consumer choice to lead the way. Economies of scale are mechanisms that are built to provide to those preferences, and not the other way around. True capitalism has lifted billions of people out of poverty, yet there isn't a single case in history where socialism has done so for over a century. And the closer an economic system gets to socialism from communism, the faster it declines. Socialism is demonstrably unfeasible in the long run. 
Bitcoin's consumer base values (prefers) a decentralized system more than we prefer the lightning speed of transactions as shown with the resistance to BU. We can prefer literally anything we want. We don't owe Jihan a god damn thing. Jihan serves us and only us. My preferences align with POWC, but I'm also not alone the economic majority. But considering we have gone from never considering a POWC to it being coded as we speak,  you're in denial if you think consumer preferences aren't changing. 
A POWC doesn't destroy Bitcoin. It realigns it with consumer views if enough consumers are sick of miner centralization. 
Will we maintain a perfectly decentralized system? No, but it's not binary, and it's a whole lot more centralized than anything we've had before. And if we chose to make it more decentralized, we can do that with a few lines of code. It's not "tearing the system down and rebuilding, its recalibrating our preferences on what we as consumers value.

We aren't talking about servers, we are talking about the consumer PC market. If you want to broaden it outward, hell you could include gaming systems, because technically they are all computers as well. But you know just as well, that the PC market and the gaming console market are two completely different markets. We can play semantics all day long. But the fact still remains &gt;70% of PCs run Windows, and Linux and OS X don't even come close. 
And I'm glad you brought up smartphones. If I recall, Microsoft has a smartphone don't they? So if you claim that Rootstock is first to the smart contracts market because it "is" bitcoin, would you say that Microsoft's phone was also first to the smartphone market? No you wouldn't. Because Apple captured that particular market segment, which was different than the PC segment (even though, technically they are still just computers again). 
Sure it's possible that Ethereum is to the smart contracts market what blackberry or Palm were to the smartphone market, but iOS made a smartphone that was easy for the masses and substantially better than any predecessors, so unless Rootstock can do that, I have a hard time believing that just because it spawns into existence, ethereum's $4B market cap is just going to vanish.
Again, maybe I'm wrong, but at this point we're both just speculating. But I won't accept the statement that Rootstock is first to the smart contracts market... at least not the clearly more specified market they are going for (Turing Complete). Bitcoin does one thing very well (secure store/transfer of value), and I see it growing no further than that.

If for some reason, email was to stop being able to transmit messages, you can bet people would revert back to postal letters.
If bitcoin becomes impossible to spend efficiently, only to trade and then convert into fiat, it will have lost it's main selling point over gold. At that point, honestly I'd rather invest in something I can hold. The ***only*** thing that gives bitcoin a serious advantage over gold it it's spend-ability. If you are trying to convince me that in a financial crisis, people won't see gold as valuable, I'm sorry you have just lost all credibility. People revert back to what is comfortable. And the reason gold still holds value today is because historically it has held value for thousands of years. End of story.


Well in that case, everyone but the user would be at advantage holding the status quo considering the spenders are the only ones suffering right now. Since the spenders give it value (for what they are able to buy with it... look at Venezuela), they are beholden to the spenders. If the spenders can't spend it, or are beholden to massive fees through some service provider just to spend it, away goes the value.
Any way you slice it you are wrong. Bitcoin has value because people are willing to sell things and services for it, with the idea that they can later buy things and services for it. If you can't spend it, there's really no purpose for it. I can make a limited (21M) slips of "Auwardamn money", and distribute it, but if no one accepts it as payment, it doesn't have value.

Ethereum has a fundamentally different purpose. I don't think it will ever fully take over bitcoin, even if it gets a higher market cap. 
Bitcoin has the sole purpose of value store and transfer. Ethereum has the purpose of a smart contract programming platform. It's like comparing a computer to the internet. The compliment each other, they don't fight with each other. Competing store/transfer of value coins like dash maybe offer a threat, but this fear of Ethereum taking over is unfounded. A non supply capped crypto coin is a terrible idea to store value in. It's a great idea to buy a lot cheap though because there is an element of scarcity though, so as demand increases, the price will also. But they serve a completely different purpose.

Just look at our US constitution. Once a document that only granted certain powers to the government, now being used to justify the governments actions because something isn't listed as an explicit right. You think the rules of bitcoin won't be used against us like that?

Exactly. So when they continue on using their bitcoin as usual, they will just continue on using BTC. Most services have already come out claiming that they will see BTC as the true bitcoin unless there is overwhelming support for the otherside.
So unless there is a massive sell off of BTC for BTU (there won't be unless there is manipulation from billionaires trying to hijack it), people will continue using BTC as normal and BTU will fade away.
The whole BTU rise in support is so blatantly manufactured that it's sickening to see how people fall for it. McAfee is one of the shadiest individuals on the planet, Ver is massively invested in Altcoins and profits off all this drama from people divesting, and Jihan is clearly out to either control bitcoin and/or has a gun to his head in China. 
There's no way these people can honestly believe that the buggy code just put out by 10 random developers is a better path forward than the team of ~80 developers who have been in it from the beginning.
People seem to confuse the rise in hash power are the rise in support. User support is with BTC far and away. It's just that no one can really vote and have it even make a difference without investing millions. 
A change on POW fixes that entirely. And if it doesn't, people will just divest to an emerging alt coin that does.

I don't think he's dumb at all. In fact I think he's quite clever. He's using a popular sentiment (fees are too high and times are too long) to garner support for a "solution" where he will temporarily increase the block size, just enough to relieve pressure, and then slowly but surely tighten them back up just to the point of pissing everyone off. He then has a direct throttle to control miner profits, and the miner operations become just like OPEC, swimming in cash, while just keeping the rest of the network just afloat. Want to challenge him? Start a multimillion dollar mining facility. 
LN potential is future and still hypothetical. Transaction fees by throttling transactions is doable tomorrow, and he knows that. His end goal is to make as much money as possible, not the ideological standpoint of using bitcoin to make the world better. 
In a hard fork, especially one with a POWC, he would eventually lose out in the long haul because obviously bitcoin with a second layer is better for the user. But by the time the markets settle and people realize they are being controlled, he will already be cashing out and his mining hardware obsolete. And if we don't POWC he just joins back in with the original chain offering massive hashing power again. 
It's pretty ingenious, but those who can see more than 10 feet in front of them aren't buying it.

The entire point of bitcoin is a decentralized network. 
If another group wants to hijack the infrastructure, to change that purpose, then yes, I would be willing to ride this out to the "end" because the "end" is *still* a decentralized payment network. If BU wants to fork off and have a centralized high hash network, then please do so. If they get economic majority in the short run (laughable but I guess possible) then they can even keep the name. 
The point being is that ***bitcoin is intended to be a decentralized payment network***. It's what gave us this initial valuation to begin with, and it's what will keep the project alive even if BU "wins". There isn't another one that exists. It may take years, it may take decades, but that idea will remain, and no matter how many times it is attacked, it will stay alive. If you're in it for the short term profits, then ya you should be concerned. But if you believe in the idea of a decentralized currency, then you'll understand that the profits will come in time. This is just a delay.

You could be correct, I hadn't heard that, and looking back at the link it doesn't explicitly say that he wrote it (at least not that I can see). 
But regardless, it doesn't mention the block size, the entire piece is based on the idea of holding Segwit hostage for the purpose of profits. This may be reaching into speculation, but it's pretty common knowledge that if you post something (or share/retweet something) and don't offer some sort of rebuttal, you are taken to agree with it. I don't know if any times where I or anyone else has just reposted something they don't agree with, and not commented as to why they don't agree. 
So in the regard, again, maybe it's reaching, but I believe he at least in some capacity agrees. And there is an agreement to this sentiment in that if he *didn't* write it, then *other* miners feel the same way. Further backing up the idea that BUs proposal is only to benefit the miners.

Not necessarily. Ask yourself why is there even a block limit to begin with, and look into the technical reasons as to why, and you will understand the opposition to big blocks. 
It's great that you are new to bitcoin. And it's great for you to have an opinion. But your opinion contradicts hundreds, if not thousands of individuals who have been in bitcoin much, much longer than you. Not only that, many of the people you are contradicting literally developed the code that we have today. They are directly responsible for what bitcoin is today. So it's not very fair for you (or others) to come in, with very little technical understanding of the protocol, and advocate for something that directly kills what they have built. 
Bitcoin is designed so that people who disagree can go their own separate ways. Hence the hardfork. So rather than oppose it, embrace it, and allow those who built what bitcoin is today to continue along their path.

You don't understand. If decentralization remains the primary consumer preference, then the suppliers must work around that. Sometimes economies of scale isn't possible. Or there could be an economy of scale that we cont yet conceive that caters to that decentralization. It doesn't matter.
The reason we got to where we are today is because we as a group accepted that ASICs were ok, and some level of centralization was our consumer preference. If we realize the bad problems with that, there is nothing fixing our preferences to remain that way. If we POWC, and we were to forever have decentralization as the main consumer preference, then we would remain forever decentralized even if that means we sacrifice usability. Literally nothing prevents us from that. We *chose* some level of centralization because we as consumers can perceive some level of benefit more than we would get from remaining completely decentralized. But in a free market we can just as easily change that choice, nothing holds us to that. That definitely can't be said for communism or socialism or favoritism. That can only be done where consumers have few choice. 
Do you understand the difference between an independent and dependent variable? Because that's exactly what's happening right now. Consumer preference is the independent variable. Economies of scale is the dependent variable.

Easy there Clancy. I wasn't attacking you at all. Let's not go all ad hominem here. 
In fact, your last point validates my point. The bigger picture is controlling blocksizes he completely controls his profits. Without a doubt. Nothing further needs to be developed. He can do this tomorrow. 
He forks off, makes block sizes loose enough to break even while the users transfer over to the chain with very small transaction fees. He then waits till his chain is accepted as "Bitcoin" and then he tightens the grip. Blocksizes don't increase as loads increase and we are back to full, and no one can control it but the miners.
It's not something that needs to be developed. It's literally something that can happen immediately. I'm not arguing that LN doesn't have higher potential. I'm arguing that controlling supply is a perfect way to set the price. Thats economics 101. 
If you don't think this makes sense, just look at OPEC. That's literally exactly what they do. 
Edit: also for some "bitcoin aficionado", you should understand that BU is not a HF just set at 2MB. It's a HF that allows for hash power to vote to increase or decrease block sizes accordingly. In other words, miners can make blocks as big or small as they want and only those equal hash power can challenge them.

If you try to strong arm your position again, I hope they do. The user goal of bitcoin is a decentralized store of value that is literally impossible to steal without the private keys or a 51% attack. If you try to make a move to consolidate the power for a 51% attack, then yes I will again support a POWC until it becomes obvious that doing so is a bad economic decision. 
Satoshi made the assumption that because it would be to expensive to make a run at 51%, no one would. That assumption has proved false. Thus, measures must be taken to protect all the parts of the system that depend on that assumption. 
Also, you can buy a GPU anywhere for relatively cheap. ASICs have few manufactures and those that do sell them sell them for astronomical amounts (high barrier to entry).

1) that's not how bandwidth works. Bandwidth is a data *rate* and deals with the amount of data per second. ETH also includes many limitations that make it overall a factor of magnitude less secure/more centralized than the bitcoin blockchain which allows it to transact faster. Comparing ETH to BTC is like comparing bitcoin to VISA. Entirely different platforms designed for entirely different things.
2) The maximum block one can create on a 1MB Segwit chain is about 4MB (1MB base block and 3MB witness block), meaning that if you double the base block, it doubles that capacity, making a S2X chain capable of 8MB blocks, [which has already been proved to be beyond our practical limit](

That's like buying a car not caring about what is under the hood.
Bitcoin is not PayPal or visa. It is a fundamentally different protocol. And the very fundamental aspect of how that protocol works drives the size of a transaction. When you combine lots of small inputs in a transaction, you put a strain on the network, and you need to pay to process that strain. Bitcoin is not a fucking charity.

The guy above is a pompous prick. Again, you have to understand an MSB doesn't make us officers of anything. It simply holds us responsible to collect information in the event of an investigation. So your AML and KYC can be as strict or open as you want, but in the even of an investigation, you'd better have info. 
So short answer. Any time you feel there's the possibility of illegal activity occurring you should file an SAR. And in the government's eyes, with the exception of things like a car purchase from a licensed car dealer, $10k transactions are always suspicious. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:16:19
Again, 100% incorrect. "Bitcoin" is the chain that the consensus agrees upon. Just because someone else includes the name bitcoin, doesn't change anything. It has always been the case that I can clone the bitcoin code and have my own coin. It's not the name or the code that gives it value. There are still, and will always only ever be 21M "Bitcoins" in the sense that there is a single chain, that the world retains consensus on. 
The answer to the question of "what gives bitcoin value?" Is simply the fact that if you don't have a private key with bitcoins, you can't send any bitcoin. And the only way to be able to send bitcoin is to have someone give you some amount of bitcoin. You can convince them through labor, trading something else of value, begging, etc, but the concept still remains that you cannot send bitcoin if you don't first have any. And creating a different chain of "bitcoin" doesn't change anything. When I accept "bitcoin" for services, or even if I trade cash for them for value store, I am expecting to run a validating node, on the consensus network, and for X amount of bitcoins to be validated by that node. No amount of forks can make coins appear where they are not on the consensus chain.

You're an idiot, caught up in semantics.
" And they would fill out an SAR for us, and when questioned, we would forward them to the SAR we filed."
Its not too difficult to figure out that when I say that, I mean that there would be an SAR filled out against us, in respect to our transaction, and when/if authorities investigated us, then we would simply show them all the information of the SAR that we filed. We did nothing illegal, but that wouldn't mean we wouldn't/shouldn't have an SAR filed against us with our own transaction. An SAR means nothing really. Its not an offense. Its just notifying FinCEN.
And they wouldn't tell us, obviously. But anyone who is capable of reading basic english can read the law and understand that such a transaction would qualify for an SAR to be filed. And if we tried to get around it we would actually be in trouble because we *would be laundering* at that point. If we do nothing illegal we have nothing to fear.
Your overconfidence in the FinCEN system is what lets me know *you* are actually the ignorant one here. FinCEN is a joke, but its required so we are compliant.

But if you don't get the required AML KYC information, your ass is on the line. 
So if whoever it is, is being honest and prompt, we can very easily get all the information required to make a proper transaction in a matter of hours, no matter who it is.

Horseshit. An analyst is anyone who can accurately analyze and predict price behavior, including but not limited to engineers. I worked as a consultant/analyst for a short period, with a mechanical engineering degree. Your imaginary engineering degree doesn't make you special. 


When did I say there was an explicit one for each company. Analysts are hired by sector and manage a portfolio particular to their industry of expertise. O&amp;amp;G analysts (which I was) monitor things like the natural gas market, petrochemical market, and baseline performances of likeminded epc and process companies and invest accordingly based on comparable performance. I had about 15 different companies under my portfolio, and I knew the financial status of each one, their amount of debt, current projects, how those projects were performing, who the management team was, how many people were hired on projects, turnover rates, safety ratings etc etc etc. comparable to the cryptocurrency market, knowing the purpose of the private key is as basic as knowing what the EPS is for a particular company. 


Once again, bullshit. The wolf of wall street is not real Wall Street. My days were filled With mind numbing calculations of WACC, and other particular ratios, compared to the actual subjective analysis of a company. Multiple page reports based off of a recommendation to buy sell or hold, after crossing both datasets. Wall Street is very calculated. It's not just "buy low sell high". To think you don't need to have a basic understanding of how a bitcoin transaction is constructed, you are banking entirely off the speculation and trust of other people to make you money, which is luck,  and in turn, by the very definition, gambling.

No, because there's no reason to believe that everyone who is buying crypto currency is committing a crime. 
State laws are actually in general very friendly to crypto currencies.

The system collapses in what most people know as "the business cycle", where, in order to not let money inflate too much, interest rates on that debt start to increase. Then it becomes a game of musical chairs for who holds the most amount of assets at the time (hard value), and who can afford to continue to borrow and run money making operations.
Think of the 2008 housing bubble. There appeared to be infinite money, and prices kept rising, and people could still get that money to pay to buy a house they wanted. But then interest rates started to rise. Not only was it harder to get a loan to buy a house, but now the people in those houses who couldn't really afford them in the first place are seeing their house payment increase because of their adjustable rate mortgages.
It becomes a race to see who can get their money out the fastest and preserve value, but with all sellers and no buyers, the prices quickly drop under the outstanding loan amount and people succumb to foreclosure. Meanwhile, people who are holding the actual value/money from the interest of those loans, can come right back in, and buy that house up for bottom dollar. Not just houses, but any and all assets. Rinse and repeat.
So yes the "rich get richer" but mostly because the "rich" are in on the bubble signals and know when to get out. Meanwhile the working poor are encouraged to buy cars and homes they can't afford, and enter into debt contracts that are based on hot air. But if you understand this basic concept, its pretty clear what the signals are, and you can avoid being scammed by the system. The only way to fix the problem, however, is sound money.

A higher hash rate makes it difficult for anyone to attack the network. By decreasing difficulty, you open the network up for attack. Have you heard of the price/hashpower parity? Look it up. It's fundamental to bitcoin. 
And solar power isn't "free"... solar panels cost money in time/materials/energy to produce. 
And again, the laws of thermodynamics catch up with you there too... in order to maintain the same level of security we currently have, you are going to need a lot of raspis. All of which take marginal electricity. You can't escape it. ***Because thermodynamics is a FACT of the universe.***

First off, increased users is not at all tied to increased full node count. In fact, users/volume has increased exponentially over the past few years, and full nodes have dropped substantially. 
Secondly, there is absolutely no empirical evidence that bitcoin is losing users. Other coins are gaining in market share because of the ease of multiplying your money. It's a lot easier to go from $.50 to $2.50 than $4300 to $21500. No other coin has the notoriety, nor the development team of bitcoin. Either the entire market is crashing, or every other coin but bitcoin is crashing. 
Third, you are fooling yourself if you think increasing the block size further will *increase* the number of people willing to run a node. Have you ever *actually run a node*? I doubt it. Going from 4MB (block size limit for a Segwit block) to 8MB (2x Segwit) would be catastrophic for the network. [There's empirical evidence on it]( which unlike your laughable argument, doesn't make asinine assumptions. 
Finally, if you really believe a block size increase is the solution, ***I have great news for you!*** [Theres already that option available!]( But if you expect for the rest of the market (and subsequently demand value) to follow you, you are sorely mistaken. I will continue to run a small block node, along with many, many others. Good luck though!

The common misconception of an MSB is that of really any government certification, in that literally anyone can be one with very little effort. It requires a small fee, and registering with the FinCEN group, which is nothing more than adding your information to a database. 
With that being said, what an MSB does is holds us accountable for what our customers do with their money. We are required to come up with all KYC and AML rules, with the understanding that if money is tied to criminal activity and gets traced back to us, we had better have some very useful information to hand over to the FBI. It also places the responsibility of being the "front line" of defense on us, in that we have to proactively report "suspicious activity". At the very least, that's any transaction over $10k. We can be more strict to cover our own asses, but if you make a transaction over $10k, bet your ass we are filling a formal notification to send to FinCEN. 
So to answer your questions, we would simply collect all identification information required to identify customer, and file a formal report of "suspicious activity". After that, it's out of our hands. If someone claims to be funding terrorists or something, we would never even offer them service if even out of principal. But to pay a ransom? We simply forward all of the information to the proper authorities.

Bitcoin is not going to replace cash before it first replaces gold. No one is going to spend something that's going to be worth 400% more the next year. Bitcoin has a long way to go before it becomes assetized, and by then infrastructure will be developed to handle large transaction volumes and people spending it like cash.

Really? You created energy out of thin air and defied the first law of thermodynamics? Tell me how did you do this?
The short answer is, no, you didn't run a small website *for free*, you ran is using a very, very small amount of electricity that your raspi converted to computation. You payed for that electricity. It wasn't much, but you payed for it.
That's all well and good, however, that same raspi would not even make a dent in the mining network. In order to actually do anything, you would need many orders of magnitude more raspis, and each one would have a power draw. Pretty soon, that "negligible" amount of power draw becomes noticeable.
So, yes, by the very fundamental underlying principals of the universe, ***thermo"nerd"dynamics does in fact, apply to everything...***

Cash doesn't increase in value at 400% APR. Cash isn't 100% electronically traceable. Cash doesn't have any transaction fees (bitcoin absolutely *has to have at least a small fee* in order to continue to operate and compensate miners for their efforts). Cash doesn't take 10 minutes to transact and 30 minutes to confirm (again, fundamental to the very concept of bitcoin... Bitcoin doesn't work without this lag for consensus).
Have you read the code that was submitted with the abstract? Its terrible. Wouldn't scale to even 1% of what we have now.
Projects change and mature, and as such, objectives change and mature. Turns out, bitcoin base layer acts much more like a settlement layer that absolutely demolishes ACH and wire transactions than cash.

Even non Segwit transactions only use the public key. That's the purpose of the public key, is that it is a non reversible derivative of the private key. The transaction is signed using the private key, in private, then broadcast with the public key, and using a signed transaction, and the public key, one can verify that the corresponding private key was in fact used to sign the transaction.

1) There is ample evidence to show that we should in fact implement some sort of population control because in fact, there is not infinite humans and resources are in fact absolutely scarce. That number wouldn't be 1M, but there is absolutely a number that should be considered maximum capacity and could be found through objective analysis.
2) Unlike your straw-man argument, there is in fact already an [objective analysis on block size that found that 4MB was the limit before 80% of the nodes fell from the network]( so if you would like to retain decentralization, you cannot indefinitely scale.
S2X has a maximum block size of 8MB btw. 1MB blocks with Segwit have a maximum block size of 4MB.

One thing I think newcomers get caught up in is the idea of "thousands of dollars for a single coin", as if they are an other type of coin, and purchases are done on a per coin basis. I know people realize but don't necessarily "click" with the idea that each coin is divisible by at least 8 decimal places, and the protocol can indefinitely increase that floating point. 
So if you are thinking about spending an entire coin for something, sure $4k seems absurd, but when you think of normal purchases in terms of "bits" or even "Satoshi's", it becomes much more reasonable. If you take the valuation we give to gold (the most comparable asset class at the moment imo) and apply that to bitcoin, you get a half million dollar value per coin. So take even 20% of that, and you are looking at $100K per coin. Again on a "per coin" basis, it seems absurd, but divided by 8 decimal places, it is nothing. 
I've seen veteran holders take months before it finally clicks that they don't need to buy by the entire coin. It even happened to me.

What you are talking about is valuation share, and there's more than enough to go around. Again, by your logic, just because I can make a cheeseburger, and it is worth money, doesn't mean that creating billions of cheeseburgers will inflate the USD. We already have hundreds of alt coins, most of them have "value" but are basically worthless. 
What you are seeing is exactly how free markets handle monopolies, and capitalism at its best. After the split, both currencies combined have a higher valuation than the previous bitcoin. That's because each currency offers a marginal utility in its unique form that the combined form couldn't provide. That doesn't mean that either currency was inflated. It means that there is a competitive marketplace. Nothing has changed. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:02:56
Many wallets already display in millibits, and you can change to microbitcoins, so its really a matter of perception. But trust me, I know the feeling. I really wish exchanges would change how they display when you are purchasing, because ya, spending $1000 and getting .1-.2 of something doesn't feel very satisfying. But ya, in terms of overall valuation, bitcoin is minimal compared to what it could be, based off of comparable asset classes. And with that, you can extrapolate a price and realize that even at $4000 its pretty much rock bottom, *assuming bitcoin does in fact reach the potential that we give it.*
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:54:28
Bitcoin will need to stabilize as an asset class before it becomes usable as a currency. The OP is correct that people will (and do) hold onto something that could be worth 400% in a year. But once bitcoin reaches it's true market price for the value that it carries in the scope of the entire world, deflation would be equivalent with the daily creation of value and it would appear invisible.

wut? Bitcoin is the "big block chain" at 1MB because no one uses Bcash, so it's blocks aren't full. It has absolutely nothing to do with increasing the cost of running a node. If bcash was to have full blocks, then logically speaking it would increase the cost of running a node proportionally. Most likely much more than linearly, because multisig transactions increase quadratically and RAM and bandwidth are by far the limiting factors over long term storage.

Because it doesn’t say that. It’s that simple. 
If you want to extrapolate all of the way out to that, that’s your prerogative and that’s an untested hypothesis. 
Anyone with any working familiarity will tell you that the second law of thermodynamics simply says that entropy only increases, and that’s all it says.
Anything else would be like saying 2+2 carries some far heavier meaning than it does. 2+2=4 simply says that the two integers 2 and 2 when combined with an addition operator equals the integer 4. That’s it. Anything else is separate and untested until proven.
A lot of hippies and internet professors have hijacked it to make it sound like some mysterious and profound law that runs the world. In reality, it simply just says entropy always increases.

You think a fee market can be "pushed"? We are ultimately of very little significance of what the market forces decide.
The fact is, the market wholly disagrees with your whining about $.50 to send money on the most secure, permission less platform on the fucking planet. Fees keep rising, yet people are still willing to pay it. Wonder why...
Edit: Also, while the block reward is the highest it has ever been, so is mining power, and it follows, the cost of running a competitive mining operation. Again, this isn't a charity, you shouldn't expect for the miners to run at a loss so you can send money for free.

No, semantics matter very much when dealing with scientific laws. Words are literally defined in a mathematical sense. You can’t just assume it means something else. 
And, no, the idea that everything “ is on this path to eventual nothingness” is a hypothesis based on the second law that you’ve yet to prove.
You’re so out of your league it’s not even funny at this point. 
Edit: to play along with your shitty metaphors, (pun intended) it would be like saying the second law of thermodynamics says that diarrhea will splatter all over the place. The second law may very well be used to explain why, but it’s not at all what the second law states.   
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:52:12
If your definition of "expensive" is "has a fee" get used to it. You can't have a deflationary, fee-less currency... how do you expect the miners to be compensated? That fundamentally goes against the very underlying dynamics of bitcoin. This isn't a charity. 
Following that general though process, let's assume you mean "negligible" fee, in which case the only way to fund a mining operation  would be a massive, massive volume of transactions. By the very fundamentals of computer data storage, that also requires a proportional block growth (unless you somehow create some quantum computer storage device, in which case, bitcoin fees would already be negligible for you anyways). So we grow the block sizes to handle such volume, and now only data center level nodes can handle the network. Next thing you know, you have to subscribe to a node, choosing from Wells Fargo, Bank of America, or whatever version your local bank uses. Pretty soon they see the merit in controlling inflation, the 21M coin limit gets whacked and you have absolutely no say in the matter because you aren't running a node. 
And enter your "8MB blocks don't require data centers" argument... no, but bitfuy did a study not too long ago saying that blocks bigger than 4MB would cripple 90% of the network. And in order to satisfy current Visa level transaction levels today, at the very smallest, blocks would need to be 250MB... and that's rounding down assuming all transactions at 225 bytes which is a very unreasonable assumption. 
So long story short, you can thank small blocks and the decentralization we have today for the 4 figure valuation. If you give that up for a few cents worth of fees, you are an imbecile.  
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:12:58
So you still didn't defy thermodynamics, you just converted otherwise useless energy to useful energy.

By hiring analysts making six figures, and five figure bonuses to study each and every investment, they are in fact, deeply aquatinted with the actual technology/industry of the company they are investing in. If you think true Wall Street makes trades without due diligence, you're a fool.


There's a difference between investing and using. If you are simply using bitcoin for something like an international purchase, then fine, get away with the minimum to make the transaction. If you investing any substantial money beyond what you would consider a gamble, you should most definitely understand the basics of cryptography, otherwise you are in fact just gambling. And trust me, private keys are the bare minimum you should understand, given they aren't very complicated at all. That's like learning to count to 10.

I think you are confused.... BU is literally *no block limit*. My second comment was that no one is saying do nothing. In other words, we are doing something, just not increasing the block limit.
And I'm fine with any block size increase that leaves 97.5% (2 standard deviations from the mean node hardware, obviously the top standard deviation could handle anything) of the node network intact.
Given that the most recent academic study on this topic to my knowledge said that [4MB was the practical limit]( I would prefer to play the conservative route and not increase block sizes beyond that (and 1MB Segwit bumps right up to it), until new, empirical data says we can do otherwise.
Like I said, anyone is free to fork off.
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:56:27
Transactions have a very strict format, and so as long as you conform to that format, your computer can draw up any transaction it wants, you can sign it with a private key signature, and then you basically get what looks like a medium length paragraph of gibberish random characters (similar to a pgp key for instance). 
That transaction can then be sent to any node, and it will be broadcast to the network. You can send this transaction whenever. As long as you don't change the transaction, all the funds used aren't previously spent, and it meets the current rules of a transaction, it remains valid and signed. 
So really, in order to transmit a transaction, all you have to do is transmit about 250 bytes of characters in the form of a string. So technically, you could print out the transaction, send it in the mail, have someone on the other end hand input it into their bitcoin node, and the transaction would broadcast like normal. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:54:48

@_date: 2017-08-22 19:49:24
Well then, you sir, are an idiot for not understanding the underlying basics of what you are using.
The bitcoin protocol always has, and always will calculate fees based off of transaction size, not transaction amount. Because space on a block is a limiting factor. Not because of some arbitrary limit put into the code, but quite literally by the laws of physics, and the nature of a mesh computer network reaching consensus. We can argue all day long about *where* that limit practically is, however it doesn't change the *existence* of said limit. And if you don't take that into account when using bitcoin, I will assume you are as dumb as someone using a sledgehammer to put in a finishing nail.

I never once said it would do it indefinitely. In fact, I said it would need to reach it's [full market value as a store of value asset class]( before it is usable as a currency.


hey maannn, put down the doobie for like 30 fucking seconds and realize, that there are ***future scaling efforts*** that are ***much more effective than linear scaling*** currently undergoing development. Not to mention that there are infrastructure upgrades ongoing (5G LTE is gigabit satellite connections, mesh web connections are sprouting up, and there's fucking bitcoin satellites now), and block size capacity will increase. But there was an [objective study]( done on this not too long ago that said that 4MB was pretty much the upper limit. Guess what the maximum block size for a segwit block size is... I'll give you two guesses, because you're clearly a little slower than the average bear, eh?


If you think anything in this space is acting as cash rather than a purely speculative, store of value asset, you are very, very mistaken. Also, both those coins have fundamentally different backbones in their code which will cripple them 10x more when it comes to scaling.
Bottom line is bitcoin is a consensus protocol, that we happen to use to keep track of global value allocation. And like all consensus protocols, there are tradeoffs that you have to face in order to reach large scale consensus in the computer science sense of the word. Linear scaling does nothing to improve that, and by definition actually makes it an order of magnitude harder to do later.

I wouldn't even necessarily qualify it only as that. "Bitcoin" is the chain with majority consensus (in the both computer science and semantic version of the word) in the ecosystem. That includes price parity. 
In other words, if the miners all split off and mine B2X but the market doesn't respond, "bitcoin" won't just automatically be the chain that is moving forward the fastest. The difficulty could reset on the original chain, and the markets demand it more, and it would still be "bitcoin". 
"Bitcoin" is much more complex than what was originally outlined in the original whitepaper. It is a robust ecosystem of about 5 different constituencies, all with their own motives in mind, coming to a power balance.

You specifically said “In all fairness, everything is slowly dying. (Second law of thermodynamics)”
The law mentions absolutely nothing about anything dying. You are extrapolating, and you are now trying to throw a lot of words at something that you clearly don’t understand. 
Entropy is a measure of disorder in the sense of its a measure of usability of energy. That’s all. So all the second law says is that entropy always increases. Or, the ability for heat to do mechanical work can only decrease with time. Even that is a stretch, because it literally simply says entropy only increases for any closed system. 
Anything other than that is a hypothesis and most of them are just completely wild, non related things made up by internet professors.

Not this particular scenario no. But like I said. We are not officers of the law. We don't get to pick and choose. Someone paying a ransom is not an illegal activity. Someone spending ransom money with us is. Plain and simple. If it isn't illegal, it's not our problem. We do our due diligence and report it to the proper authorities. The authorities may want to track the money without the other party being alarmed. Not our place to interfere. That's not in the agreement we signed. 


That's not how laws work. Laws don't permit, they prohibit. So no, there is no law permitting us to do anything. There's also no laws to prohibit us from providing someone money for a completely legal activity (paying a ransom is not illegal). We would report a ransom payment no matter how small. Suspicious activity doesn't have a minimum transaction amount.

You have a hypothesis about the future. The second law of thermodynamics again, simply says that entropy only increases (and is non zero but that’s another discussion for another day). That law is observable in all systems and does apply, as an efficiency factor. Because we have experiments, that link measurable levels of entropy, and we can approximate isentropic systems and relate the two and predict real world outcomes. That doesn’t mean that all systems “fall apart and decay” overtime. 
Again, you are extrapolating the second law of thermodynamics far beyond what it actually says. It’s really not that mysterious and doesn’t carry the predictive power you think it does. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 00:04:43
The second law of thermodynamics is a formula that shows that entropy of a system can only increase. That's it. People extrapolate that to mean a lot of things, but in reality, its simply used to estimate losses in processes from it's isentropic condition to it's real condition.
In other words, its a very boring concept that simply boils down to an efficiency coefficient when all is said and done.

@_date: 2017-11-16 21:08:55
From your comment I'm not too terribly sure you understand how bitcoin works...
Your wallet software creates a transaction just like filling out a check. That transaction is then submitted to a node (for free) which then validates it, and forwards it to other nodes which validate (for free) and forward, until it works its way to a miner's node and the miner node who validates it once again and decides to include it in a block. This block then goes out to each and every node, and each node runs back through each and every transaction (for free) and checks to make sure they are all valid before updating their network view. 
This works well when there's no real volume. A handful of transactions is easy and the reason to run a node may be worth it. But if you have many many transactions being transmitted, the node must validate each one (for free), and then revalidate each one in the block (for free). If we let this go on forever, eventually the cost gets too big for you to run a node. You couldn't run one if you wanted too. It gets so costly that the companies who can afford it, start charging for access, just like vpns and newsbin sites, or they just sell your activity like Facebook and Google. You also are at their beckon will if they want to give you access. US govt wants to shut you down. They simply tell node operators to block you (so longer uncensorable).
Not only this, transactions still have a fee, because you can't have no fee and limited supply. Someone needs to pay the miners. BCH isn't sustainable in its short term, no one who knows what they are talking about thinks it will be 0 fee forever. And how can you force someone to pay a fee, if supply isn't limited? If I'm getting in whether I pay $5, $.01 or $0, why would I pay anything? That's called tragedy of the commons. 
So, I'm not really sure what you are talking about "contracting" through a node, but that doesn't happen through btc or BCH. But I can assure you, increasing on chain transactions only will most definitely lead to contracting/permission access to the bitcoin network through very expensive nodes that can handle blocks. And it would still take 10 minutes for payments to be verified. And there would still be a fee. And everyone can track your money. This is just life with a distributed ledger system. 
That's why we are scaling off chain, making it permissionless, P2P, and uncensored on chain, that anyone can run a node and settle transactions with, without needing anything special. But the unfortunate reality is that we simply can't support global volume on chain, and remain decentralized.

This is a problem with conflating terms in bitcoin as more normal people join. That may be an English definition of "consensus", but the original usage of the term in this space is the computer science sense of the word: 
"Consensus" is a term used in distributed computing, to determine the network "state" as in "steady state" or "transient state" or what "state" H2O is in at any particular temp/pressure. Every 10 minutes, thousands of computers come to *consensus* about the "state" of all balances for all public keys. Somewhere along the lines, people decided to use it to describe the state of public opinion as well, which is why there's so much confusion about "what is the real bitcoin" now. The answer to that question lies right within your own node... "Bitcoin" is whatever the network state is, according to blocks that come in and conform to your consensus rules. There's as many different "bitcoins" as there are different chains following different consensus rules.

I don't think bitcoin needs to have a spending usecase to have value. It's already proving itself as a way to store value/speculate detached from the rest of the market, and could very easily take over the speculative precious metal market, or at least a substantial share of it. 
With that market alone, current valuations would be at least 10x what they are now.

Bitcoin uses the same cryptography as the codes that guard our and the rest of the world's secrets, and things like our nuclear access. If cryptography is broken, bullets are the only currency. Your precious metals won't mean squat unless you have a musket and are willing to melt them down. 


If it is clear that all of cryptography is broken, and we aren't living in a nuclear wasteland, no one would be opposed to a POWC and equal allocation of capital based on a new cryptographic curve that is quantum computing proof. Trivial issue. Fuck the minimal trivial transactions that happen post hack. We just have 8T to a few banks that were too big to fail. You don't think we would bail bitcoin out?


These are all we'll know bugs that have since been fixed. 


Once again, you seem to not understand how self verification works. 


�� once again, you fail to understand self verification. Why do you think those bugs came to light? Because someone's nodes found an issue. Those have since been fixed. Notice the dates on those. 7 and a half years ago. If you don't have the private keys, you aren't spending. Plain and simple. 


Huge rant, got through the first sentence... yes we do... if it has the private key it's valid. If it doesn't have the private key, it's invalid. 
"Furthermore" if someone has the quantum computing power to crack Shaw 256, they aren't using it to go after bitcoin, they are going after government secrets/nuclear codes. Again, trivial non issue.

There's a mixture of problems at play. Yes, in a few market, fees will rise and be sold to the highest bidder. But ask yourself, if you want to buy a coke and it's going to be a $3 fee, are you going to reserve that block-space for yourself? On the other hand, if you have to send money to your relatives in Venezuela, but fees are capped at say $.25, do you really want your tx spent in the same light as someone buying a coke? Wouldn't you want to be able to pay an extra $2.75 to ensure you can get the money there on time?
It's a fairly basic economic principal across all schools of economics that artificial price controls cause shortages. On the other hand, block space *is* limited. At 1MB? Probably can handle more but not too much more reliably. Certainly not the minimum 250MB blocks Visa level transactions would require. And the dev work required for an arguably negligible blocksize bump isn't near as worth it as the effort spent on optimizing tx sizes/volume is. At least not short term. 
The other thing at play is the wallets have a "fee estimation" algorithm, but in reality, these are just computer programs dedicated to trying to predict the future price of something, which is exactly what quants get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to do. It isn't easy. So the easiest solution is to just grab the latest fees, and add a slight premium. This is why you see the number of middle range fee transactions increasing substantially, while low range fees either by good prediction algorithms or likely manual selection stay pretty much uniform through these high volume times. What is happening, is shitty algorithms are looking at fees picked by shitty algorithms, picked by shitty algorithms, picked by shitty algoritms... you get the picture. Feedback runaway with no actual correction factor. 
The last thing to understand is that miners usually use a greedy algorithm, meaning they take the most expensive first, and then go to the least expensive until blocks are full.  So yes, low fee txs are likely to be left out in high tx times, however these times don't usually last for too long. Those spikes on the graph are rapid drops in volume, meaning all of those transactions would have cleared, even at the lowest fee level layer within them. Meanwhile, the layers below them are hardly growing, meaning that there's a pretty uniform in and outflow of them. In other words, low fee transactions are getting into blocks about the same speed as they are being added to the mempool, even under high volume timeframes. This could be due to lack of these txs being added, but also likely due to these txs *still* getting into blocks, which anecdotally we see a lot of. Most people picking their own fees are still getting into blocks at less than 100 sat/b even with the median being around 700s/b. 
Long story short is, I predict fee selection will be a paid position in the near future and most users will be using aggregator services for common txs, and those aggregators will then pay people to select their fees for them on settlement transactions. Market pricing is the fairest way to allocate resources but that doesn't mean it is convenient or easy for the layman.

A multisignature address is effectively no different from any other address, it just requires both signatures to send. So however you keep your keys now, would be no different with lightning. I use a hardware wallet, with a USB, so it would be the same. My hardware wallet would sign an opening transaction with a key it generates and that would be it. 
In the case the other side gets hacked, worst case scenario they post the latest tx and its no different from them closing anyways, best case scenario, they post an older transaction, you post the newest one and get all the funds.

I don't give the "bitcoin 2.0" argument alone credit. You don't just get to point to a non existent replacement and assume it's existence. I would argue that people don't just abandon a store of value just because something better comes along. Gold will continue to be a speculative asset far into the future even if bitcoin competes for majority of its market share. And there are already other coins competing, and none of them are even holding a light in comparison so I'm not too concerned.

If blocks get to the size where it requires infrastructure server level hardware to run a node (and to get to today's visa level alone, you would need 250MB blocks at the absolute minimum) you can most certainly assume there will be access fees to make SPV requests. Not only that, the security of an SPV node cripples over time due to a statistical analysis of the bloom filters used, so you really aren't even private at that point. 
And I don't pay fees for my checking account, doesn't mean the system is preferable. There's more to the economics of banks than fees. Fractional reserve lending is far more of a concern than an ATM fee every once in a while. 
The reason you can run an SPV wallet and connect to a node for free is *because* blocks are small. And if you care about privacy and deal with any substantial amount of bitcoin, bragging about not having to run a full node is like bragging about getting a 400 on the SAT.

The main chain has *at least* 20% hash power, and that will grow substantially as the price for B2X is dumped. Miners (at least major players) don't hold a substantial amount of bitcoin, they have very large bills to pay. 
Worst comes to worse, it would take at most 100 days to reach a difficulty readjustment on the main chain, and it would most definitely be less than that,, because miners aren't going to mine a shy chain just to hold out. 
Signaling and mining are completely different things.
I'll put money down that S2X has at most 50% of hash power for at most a couple days.

Most people have no experience in a technical field and don't understand the purpose of a whitepaper. Therefore, they place far more importance on it, way later in the game that it was ever intended to be. 
Whitepapers propose an idea, and how it could possibly be achieved. That's it. But when things are realized later on, like O(n) scaling vs O(n^2 ) scaling, its entirely ok and normal to deviate from the original plan of action. If people think we got to the moon on the initial revision of all parts designed in the mission, they are kidding themselves. As circumstances change, methodologies change.

Bitcoins current problems with scaling have no bearing on its ability to act as a long term hedge for large amounts of value. It's ready for that purpose now. 


You have much much more to be worried about if all of cryptography is broken. And you are wrong, it's entirely possible to reverse it. Look at the DAO. We literally have a history of all transactions at all periods in time; a new curve could be chosen and the chain rolled back to that point and stated again with a new hard fork with new security. 


1) yes it is the same, cryptography just allows proving of ownership but the network state is just basic math 2) it's not possible to "litter the chain with fraudulent/compromised transactions. Each block is independently verified. If you push a block that has even a single fraudulent transaction, it's easily verifiable and your block gets ignored, you get blocked from contacting any other nodes that ignored your block, and you are just on your own chain. It's literally not possible to post a fraudulent transaction.

At no point in the whitepaper does it mention anything about fees being cheap.
In fact it clearly says that once coin supply is diminished, the incentive to mine comes from fees.

Well sure, if you have a couple hundred dollars in crypto, a hardware wallet probably isn't worth it. But many people soon find that a few thousand dollars initial investment is turning into 5/6 and sometimes 7 figure usd balances, so in that regard, $80 for top of the line security is a bargain. 
And it's not so much the malware (and there's screen cap malware, which can later be sent through an AI algorithm to recognize bitcoin addresses on any particular frame), but more so how the wallet was generated. What was the source of entropy? What does the code look like? How do you know it isn't on a predetermined sequence of keys. Again, a few hundred dollars, not worth the paranoia. But a few hundred could turn into a few thousand and a few thousand can easily turn into a few hundred thousand over the course of a few years. If that's the case you may want to take it a little bit more seriously. 
And yes, you could load a wallet on an offline computer with a brand new OS, but like I said, if you pick 100 random people, how many people do you think will do that? Meanwhile, a consumer electronic device gives them the same security and more usability for far less hassle, at $80... that's a bargain to me.

The seed is used to create practically unlimited addresses. So on any particular wallet app, it's going to give you a new address to receive to, and any time you accept a new payment it will give you a new address for privacy. It just ties them together to make it look like a full amount. This is a standard process and the seed should work in any wallet software just the same. 
Unfortunately, if you are inputting the seed into a modern wallet software, and it isn't finding any coins, you more than likely don't have any coins, because the wallet would take the seed, which includes your xpriv key, and your chaincode, which tells it how to sequence addresses, and would search for a reasonable amount of addresses for any available UTXOs (spendable amounts of bitcoin) tied to any addresses it may have generated.

It's actually very dissimilar. The problems with today's banking are
1) fractional reserve lending
2) regulations making it oligarchic competition, with pressure points that government can coerce through. 
Neither of those are true in the situation I'm proposing. In the situation I'm proposing, you could very easily become a bank. And your neighbor. And his brother. All for the very basic cost of running a node and writing some software. There's too many "banks" for the government to coerce people through, you can't fractionally reserve lend because there's no counterparty risk, and you can't overcharge in fees because anyone can just start a "bank" and compete in services that you offer, for a reasonable price. 
Tell me, do you use a wallet software that you didn't code every single line of? Does that not mean you are aggregating some level of trust into others that they won't steal from you? What keeps that wallet provider honest? The answer is because it is trivially easy for anyone to write an honest wallet software to compete. 
Edit: also, minimum block size for Visa level transactions alone are 250MB, which an average computer cannot handle. In such a situation, you would have to use a lightweight client, that got its information from a full node (likely run by an institution at this point) trusting that they are telling you the truth. Not only that, it'd likely be a paid access node. And they can deny your ability to transmit any transactions if your public key shows up on a blacklist. I think this looks much more like the current system we have today, no?

I think we are talking past each other and not actually disagreeing.
I believe the majority of gold's value comes from speculation, and that its a fallacy to believe it's industrial demand gives it some "intrinsic value" any more than bitcoin. I believe that its inflation hedge days are coming to an end as bitcoin offers everything it can, and more, and I don't believe the dental/electronics/jewelry industry can consume enough of the supply to keep the price where it is.
In other words, I'm very bullish with bitcoin, and very bearish with gold as purely inflationary hedges over the next decade.
But I also don't believe you can just point to "bitcoin 2.0" if it doesn't actually exist, saying that it exists. Sure its possible to exist, but it doesn't.

I think you are misunderstanding me. I don't believe bitcoin (the traded asset) is anything other than an inanimate "object" that compliments the current system. It is not a new system at all. It may have its own subsystem that allows for such an object to exist (he blockchain) but to think that bitcoin in and of itself is going to solve all problems is frankly naive to what the bitcoin protocol is. The bitcoin protocol is simply a way of communicating transfer of value in an uncensorable and immutable way, and keeping that value from being manipulated by the controllers. Other systems can be built using a blockchain type of protocol, but "bitcoin" is just any other dumb commodity.

"Lots of cash" is fairly relative the the size of the operation you want to run. When I'm talking about barriers to entry, there's really nothing that can be colluded against to make it harder for you to enter. Block sizes are the only real case for such a situation to occur and if that was the real bottle neck the community would have no problem forking to slightly bigger blocks. 
That's the problem with monopolies and mega corporations today. Not that they exist, but that they use their power and resources, and more importantly lobbying power with the law to make it substantially harder for competition to form. There's a reason Walmart lobbies the hardest for minimum wage every year and it has nothing to do with wanting to pay their employees more... they can do that without laws. 
As long as anyone can simply start up a node, they can act as a hub. If there's no permissioned access, no one else has any leverage over them. Stock trading? Must be a licensed broker. Investing? Must be accredited. Open a restaurant? Minimum wage for employees rather than mutual agreement, and must pass health inspection test rather than customers simply choosing and reviewing. Most barriers to entry are put in place to be well meaning but quickly devolve into being manipulated against you unless you are the main player. This would be perfect competition, not trying to enter an oligarchy. 
Edit: also, the person opening and closing the channel pays the fee. You could very easily just optimize balancing your channels and avoid the fees to settle all together.

I'd rather have centralization build on top of a decentralized base layer than a centralized base layer.

If we centralize the base layer, then there I need permission to implement my solution to compete with the also centralized second layer, if there even is one.

Timelocks are useful for postdating transactions and locking funds to a date in the future. More importantly, timelocks extend bitcoin scripting into the dimension of time, opening the door for complex multistep smart contracts.”

No, "store of value" literally means, "it stores value".
[Sore of value]( is a basic fundamental property of currency as taught in just about every elementary economics class. Just because it doesn't store value long term well compared to other assets does not mean it is not a store of value. It may not be a *preferable long term store of value*, but it most definitely is a store of value. You don't get to just rewrite fundamental economics on a whim.

You open a channel with someone else. If you want to send to someone else, you can "hop" which includes a "secret" value that is revealed only after the person gets paid through a chain of ious also needing the value. You could very easily insert some sort of programmatic check that you are only sending funds if you receive the a transaction based on the same secret (how it  is structured anyways). That way, the only way they get the money they sent is by posting that closing transaction with the secret to the blockchain... at which time you can just go get the secret, and unlock the payment that triggered you to hop. 
If I'm running a hub, I would be setting it up to work as hopping only unless I explicitly tell it to send elsewhere. I can even have all channels programmed to send to a separate private key, that could be a paper wallet. No reason to send money outwards without me actively making it do it (which I could use a signature to verify me doing it). I want people sending me money in the from of fees and I want to balance my channels.

Is a provably limited supply, electonically and permissionlessly transferable asset, not valuable? Seems extremely valuable to me. 
And with 2nd layer solutions on top, centralized or not, they become even more valuable. 
My grocery store is centralized. It's still valuable to me. If they raise the price of milk to $15/gal, I go to a different one, because no one controls the *idea* of a grocery store, thus they are prolific. If LN 1 fucks around, I move to LN2, or start my own because barrier to entry is so low. With a centralized base layer, this isn't possible. 
Centralization will have to come for ease of use to the end user. But as long as barrier to entry is low for competition to enter, centralization isn't a bad thing. Monopolies/oligarchies are a bad thing. Perfect competition often results in best product for the consumer.

It would take you somehow proving a) the existence of a higher being followed by b) proving that the Bible is then the word of said higher being before you can then use it to prove other things pertinent to it. You can just say 2+2 =4 if you don't define the concepts of real numbers, addition, and equality. So you don't get to point to portions of the Bible as the basis for further truth, if you have not first proved the truth of the Bible. My claim and evidence remain, that all evidence points to the Bible being written decades after said events happened, and there is strong evidence to support that they, along with everyone else in the region at the time, were under the influence of DMT, a drug which has been throughly shown to give users experiences with storylines directly from the Bible. You have not successfully refuted my claims other than pointing to the Bible itself to claim it is infallible, and then pointing to your own (clearly elevated sense of) self righteousness and holiness as sources to back it up. That doesn't count for logic. I don't care if it makes you feel good/bad, or if you believe it is a substitute or not, under rational thought patterns, it doesn't equate to logic.  


More flowery bullshit with no actual logical substance. "I don't believe the guys who saw burning bushes talking to them, angels in the sky, an immaculate conception, a man being swallowed by a whale and living to tell the tale, turning some fish and bread into a feast for hundreds, raising people from the dead, etc etc is a product of drug induced thought, therefore it isn't" doesn't constitute a logical argument. Especially when there is evidence directly to the contrary still on the table.  


So because my great grand dad remembers "spooks" as having devil horns on their foreheads, and he was there, should we transcribe his thoughts as truth? Remember, I've posted evidence that these writings came at least 20 years after the contrary. Again, you don't get to use the Bible to disprove this, because again, it's truthfulness is the subject of question here. And again, I give 0 shits what you "think", I care about your (obviously lack of) logical rebuttal. 


Really? I have a right to my life as self asserted by me. Don't believe me? Come and take it. 


Just because reality is sad doesn't give logical grounds to just introduce a substitute for it. Yes, we are slabs of meat, with electrical current running through us, and every single thought and action we take is a direct result of external stimulus on a collective of organisms that make us up. I'm sorry if science doesn't line up with your fairy tales, but we don't rewrite reality to fit your hallucination beliefs. 


Citation needed. Pretty much all current scientific evidence points to the universe starting in a Big Bang and taking billions of years before we evolved to arrive. Not to mention, why would this creator not grant all other living things, including our evolutionary ancestors, the same rights? Do fish not have rights? Jesus killed fish. Do fish not have a right to live? Maybe it's because fish haven't developed the evolutionary benefit of a conscious, cannot comprehend higher level logic, and haven't developed the ability to defend their right to live (or absence thereof because clearly they can't conceive it).


Oh the irony, you mention reason and understanding the world around us, yet you have not demonstrated a lick of logic or the ability to look beyond a 2000 year old version of erowid to realize pretty much no scientific minds believe in a higher power, and those who do broadly denounce organized religion due to its limited sight on reality.

No, most people believe that you don't build a worldwide decentralized internet currency with elementary level scaling techniques like linear growth. We respect the complexity of the problem and understand that a workable solution takes time and effort, and will be harder than just doubling the block size every few months.
BCH may get the transactional volume on the short term, sure. But BCH has just stunted its future by doing exactly what small blockers were against in setting the precedent for linear scaling. Have fun with 30 minute block confirmations (sure to increase as block sizes increase), have fun with lack of fungibility because everyone can see every transaction, have fun with $.50 fees, sure to rise as the block reward decreases. Those are all fundamental properties of the bitcoin blockchain. And you just added a new shitty property, in the very rare event no one actually cares about the above mentioned and actually uses BCH regularly, and you reach Visa levels, good luck with the fees for node access, because the price to process 250MB blocks (theoretical minimum for visa level transactions, actually closer to 1GB) will be high and running a node for free as a public service won't be viable any more. 
Long story short, BCH is going to see the laughably naive fate that small blockers, computer scientists, engineers, and mathematicians have been pointing at the entire time, unfolding, right in front of their eyes. And in 5 years when bitcoin has multiple levels, are varying in complexity, but based on a completely open access, decentralized base layer that fosters creative competition, we will welcome you back to the ecosystem bitcoin deserves, but it won't be buying in at the price you left at. 
Bitcoin/BCH in its current state is absolutely abysmal for cash replacement. But it is excellent at permissionless store/transfer of value in relation to ACH and Swift, and that property can be used to build far superior replacements for cash on top. BCH just doubled down on land lines, bitcoin is shooting to become the smartphone. Time will tell.

I'll wait for you to source outlandish claims. You: "Most zoologist believe that unicorns can fly" Me: source? You: "show me a unicorn that can't fly"


Representative democracy leads to agency problem. That's a know fact that is taught in even grade level political science courses. 


So you are going to have to define what you are calling a "free market". Because if it is one that exists purely in a vacuum without any external consequences, then sure, I would agree that no such things exist. But that's not what most people define as a [free market.]( Of course power complexities become factors, no one said they didn't. But they aren't imposed externally. They and construed internally and are only as strong as the advantages they present over other competition in the market. If the goal is objectively clear (decrease murder or poverty), then the only advantage you would have over that is a solution that actually decreases murder or poverty. Maybe a little leeway in how such things are measured, but by and large, on the aggregate you are either succeeding or not succeeding. There's not much room to manipulate. 


Power consolidation is relative to competition which is directly influenced by barriers to entry. No shit Walmart wants a higher minimum wage. It's not to be a better provider, they could just raise wages internally. They want to outprice competition from being able to afford adequate help. Legislation is a well known barrier to entry to markets. If someone comes in with cheaper guns than what's currently provided, who's to stop them? In a regulated market, the government drowns them in paperwork. In a free market, they tell the government to suck a fat one. 


No it's not. I can come in and sell weed on my local turf. Sure I'd be stepping on some toes. But there's absolutely nothing stopping me, from accumulating resources, undercutting the other guy, and having a full out war if need be. Absolutely nothing. In fact I'd argue, all markets are effectively free markets, subject to relative restrictions, that with enough resources, can be waived for you and your buddies and you enter the free market realm again. The idea of a "regulated market" is really just locally applied restrictions with the threat of going to jail if you don't comply. But what's to stop you from not complying and entering the market anyways (and in doing so, entering the black market)


Quite the opposite as I described above. Markets exist, by their very definition, where there is demand for a scarce resource. The government may use force to block off a legitimate portion of that market where you have to play by their rules, but if I want to sell you something outside of there rules, there's absolutely nothing in absolute reality that says I can't. I just face higher market risks, so I charge higher costs. 


Complete opposite. Regulated markets exist within the confines of an overall free market. If you pay off the rule setter, you get to cheat. Which is why it is beneficial to sidestep the rule-setter altogether.

I don't accept the "bitcoin 2.0" fallacy without pointing to an actual bitcoin 2.0 and logical reasoning why it would cause bitcoin to go to $0. There could be an asteroid headed here right now at warp speed to take out the planet, but we don't plan our lives around that. We could completely misunderstand how the sun works, and it could explode tomorrow due to something we had no idea about, but again, we don't rationally plan around that. All signs point to waking up tomorrow and bitcoin being +/-10% of what it is today. 


This has been discussed at length from before bitcoin reached beyond 100 people. This is not a concern for anyone really. The fix is trivial.

I don't think it's going to be as intensive as you imagine. Plus, that's just one service you could offer. There's plenty of other scaling proposals, all that could easily be pursued. And most would be able to be run on a high end desktop or a low end server setup. We are talking about a small business type situation here where anyone can access the base chain without permission. That's the goal here. For that we need minimum requirements for blockchain nodes. From that, it LN gets too centralized/expensive/whatever there's nothing stopping you from having the raw horsepower of the bitcoin blockchain at your fingertips to make a new service/layer. 


I don't think those have to go hand in hand. You can lend without lending on a fractional reserve basis. For example, if I have $10k, I can lend that to someone else, with an agreed upon repayment contract that could include interest and collateral. That doesn't require any money to be created out of thin air. 


I would agree, but again, there's open access to the base protocol. With large blocks that's not possible. Imo a semi centralized LN scenario with fierce competition because of low barrier to entry is the best case scenario to compete on the end user level. If you disagree, there's always the ability to create a different layer, or your own LN node that follows your own rule, and you can interact with the base chain easily and efficiently. 
Like I said, centralization is natural and a good thing when it isn't abused. It becomes abused when you are forced to use that option. As long as competition is a primary factor, who cares?
What are your problems with banks? Not just boogeyman, "banks are evil" bullshit, but logically, lay out the bad things that banks do. And once you do that, compare those problems with a situation where there's no counterparty risk, and competition is very easy, and which of those problems isn't solved?
Banks aren't evil in what they do. Most people need a loan to buy a house. To buy a car. To go to school and get an education. They offer transaction services like Visa cards and checking accounts. The problem is not that. The problem is when the bank is the only bank in town and can change whatever they want. When they can trade with your money that you expected to be available to you. When they can create 10x your money out of thin air and lend that out under the assumption that not everyone will come back at once. When you have "banks" in the future offering all the services people want, but they are forced to compete with anyone else who can easily start another bank, then they don't get to charge whatever they want. 
Competition is good.

Entirely possible. But I see Bitcoin performing what the currently $2T gold bar and coins market is doing currently, far better than it is doing it, so the price could increase drastically from here if that happens. And then go up from there as further use cases come along.

Sorry man, but with your shadowstats references and claim that the "government is a major buyer there injecting $$$ into that market directly", that's way to much pseudo economics for me to try to address each point. 
The simple answer is, inflation is a dependent variable influenced by the amount of money available, and all of the QE money went into the stock market, and so we don't have inflation, and as rates tighten, credit is going to shrink, the market will retract, and deflation occurs during contractions.

Miners fill blocks with transactions using a greedy algorithm, filling from most expensive first until they run out of space in a block. This guy is saying that mempool backup isnt that bad, so even a low fee tx will probably get through quickly. You can find graphs and data sources of transaction fee levels and you could deduct this using those. 
In reality, this is the exact reason why on chain transactions shouldn't necessarily be end user level. Trying to pick a market rate adds a whole new complexity not there in cash. End users should deal with fixed rate/predictable rate services that the services can play games with market pricing and settling. 
Or you could use something like BCH that has no choice but to centralize because you can't have world volume and lots of nodes.

I have no doubt Facebook and Google will be offering free hubs in exchange for your data.

When we get into a situation where groups can band together and quite literally coerce the rules to disincentivize competition, that's when we get into trouble. Hence, see ISPs.

The idea with futures is to allow for someone to lock in a future price. So for example, if a miner can anticipate mining x amount of bitcoin, then with a futures contract, they can lock in that price and their operation stays afloat even if the price of bitcoin tanks. The investors in the futures lose if bitcoin tanks. The catch is, you also don't get any of the upside if bitcoin goes to $100k for example. 
Hopefully this will smooth out miner hash rates and price because miners won't be dumping and holding more than they need to and it is a much more easy thing to calculate. Should make panic drops and FOMO spikes far less severe.

If you look at bitcoin as something floating up and down in a market, then sure it makes no sense. 
But do you buy stocks in a vacuum? No, you analyze the PE ratio, the debt levels, cash flow levels, etc. Do you buy commodities in a vacuum? No, you look at the futures markets, industrial conditions, future supply estimates etc.
So why would you believe bitcoin to be any different? Do you really think you, as a passive observer, can spot critical flaws that hundreds of PhD economists, mathematicians, and computer scientists couldn't spot after *8 years* of development? Bitcoin goes much, much deeper than just a speculative asset in a market. I'm not telling you to buy, I'm telling you to look a little closer before you make naive statements with clearly a surface level understanding at best.

No, simulations are models and are only as good as their boundary conditions. You can't extrapolate information outside of its boundary conditions. The simulation running through linear code to pick random people to transact, and route them, is not at all what LN has to do, so you can't compare the two. The reason for the simulation was to challenge the idea that a large number of people could transact in a completely decentralized way via hopping. The simulation proved that quite well imo. 


Again, conflation. a single computer is not concerned with transactions not running through it. The computer is only concerned with the transactions it is takin part in. If anything, this argument works *against* on chain scaling, because in fact you *do* have to store each and every transaction on chain in RAM. Again, you can't extrapolate information outside the boundary conditions of the simulation. 


No it doesn't? I want to send to you, I simply request a path and chose from the best combination of hops. The entire graph does not need to be stored internally, and certainly the transaction state of all channels doesn't need to be stored internally which is the limitations of this simulation. I can't believe you think that somehow her linear simulation of the entire network on a single desktop computer is entirely representative of the computational intensity of a single node on the network. 


I don't see why not? You can disable forwarding if you don't want to collect fees and be used to forward. And again, there's nothing saying a further off chain level couldn't be used to settle a net for the channel, and manually rebalance for little or no fee. 


I think you are assuming this will happen far more often than I do. Less than 1% of all normal sized transactions couldn't find an immediate path. That completely neglects the structure of hubs that will be rebalancing to optimize the ability to be chosen for a hop (I know I will) and completely neglects the potential to simply increase the timeout. Again, I'm not concerned. I could be wrong, but I severely doubt it. 


No, her simulation showed that it was in fact possible to transact in a completely decentralized graph shape, something that the very first article she is replying to said was impossible. Not only is it possible (as she showed) reality says that people with economic incentives will optimize, so people *trying to be hubs* are going to purposely have many open channel options and rebalance many of them through cheaper options than on chain settling (side chain settling, credit/debit between cooperating nodes, negative fee rates). The market will solve the balancing issue. 


Like I said, I think balancing is far less of an issue than you would expect. Anyone wishing to be used in a hop has to have an attractive fee and capacity combination. Since it's possible to make money with a hop, people are going to work on optimizing both those options to have as much of an advantage to becoming a hop as possible. I know that's what I'm working on at least. 
Does this lead to a quasi centralized model? Absolutely. But you can simply blacklist my node and not connect/route through me. Easy peasy. But there's going to be network optimization through cooperating parties and by not connecting to the centralized options, you won't benefit from their efforts to balance channels and reduce the need to settle. 
Am I 100% concretely positive it will all work out? No. But are you 100% concretely positive it *won't*? And as someone who uses Venmo/bitpay, both of those options are far better than a blockchain direct payment that by definition needs 10 minutes at least to become valid. BCH can't compete with Visa/Venmo, and will forever be neckbeard hipster money. That's fine. There's plenty of neckbeard hipsters. But to pretend like somehow, it will compete for the broad population with already adopted, working alternatives is naive imo. If LN does fail to live up to its promise, BTC will continue to be a store of value, something that not even BCH can claim to do long term, because either fees will be needed or inflation will need to start again to compensate the miners. 
Edit: also wanted to add another self penalizing liberty she took was the assumption that any two random people in 10 million people would need to interact. While she showed this was reasonably possible, it also is fairly unrealistic. The average person only ever [meets about 10000 people in their lifetime]( and there's evidence to support that people only maintain relationships with [~150 people at a time]( which we can reasonably assume are fairly interrelated  through the same geography and social structures. In other words, there's very little need for me to have to have the ability to send money instantly and cheaply to any particularly also not connected party in china. Most of my spending habits are largely to the same people/places, or people who also spend to the same people places, giving relative hub structure naturally. How many people go to the same coffee shop, and through minimal degrees of separation could connect to someone else through that coffee shop.

It's simply not that simple. Bitcoin is a distributed computer network, and with that comes limitations. Every computer must download, process/validate and reupload blocks to others all within the block time, ideally so that everyone is complete with that process within the block time. 
If we increase block size, we increase processing time/resources which takes longer. If we decrease block time, we now limit the amount to time to propagate network status, or wait for more confirmations. Currently, we orphan about 3-4 times a week, meaning that your transaction could be "validated" one minute and then invalidated the next. That's why you need to wait for 3+ confirmations. This is baked into how bitcoin works, and it isn't going away. 
On chain bitcoin may have been *intended* to be an electronic cash system, but sometimes design intents and realities simply don't line up. But bitcoin makes for an incredible alternative to ACH, and cash like layers could be very easily built on top of that. 
The answer to making bitcoin more usable is not increasing on chain capabilities, it is by making the most of the on chain capabilities, by utilizing space efficiently. If we transact with each other regularly, surely we can come up with a system that simply posts the net transaction on set periods, rather than each and every transaction. Sometimes blockchain security simply isn't required. My purchase of eggs at the grocery store doesn't need to be etched into an immutable record and stored on hundreds of thousands of computers across the globe for eternity.

Hmmm, difference of opinion I guess. Most of my shopping is at the same grocery store, Amazon, gas station etc. I pay rent to the same people every month. Power bill is the same way. Car payment the same. Really have no reason to reconnect hubs, and I could always settle on another chain, and have my channel rebalanced for a minuscule cost. Ie send something like LTC for the same amount and under a smart contract it resets my payment channel lopsided to me. 


The simulation stopped early because of her RAM, feel free to run it on your own and see how long you can run it. 


She also specifically removed the idea of hubs. And mentions off chain balancing. Also, fee selection can be used to influence payments to auto balance. I can even set a negative fee. If my channel is 100% unbalanced, I offer a few satoshis net on the tx to hop through me and I don't have to settle. Node operators will optimize the same way miners optimize. 


There were 3 different classifications of failures. Less than 1% of normal txs failed. If your $.10 yours article tx (the 1.25% failure rate category) fails, do you go ape shit and assume the world is ending or do you just reclick the button and try again? Also, she specifically mentions this is due to balancing, which again, is easily addressed in an active situation rather than a "set and forget it" simulation. 


Conflation. The simulation crashing had nothing to do with LN performance, she ran out of RAM. Come on, you're better than that. 


Again, it's a *simulation* and the purpose was to show it is possible in a completely decentralized manner. She succeeded with that imo. Introduce hubs like the grocery store and there's far less channels needed. 


Again, conflation. Really man?! Her computer performance for running simulation code has nothing to do with actual network performance. Txs are offchain. PM me, and I'll set you up with a test net node and send you 10,000 to per second today. It's all off chain, it isn't limited by anything pertaining to BTC. Again you're better than that.

Literally all miners do is offer prevalidated blocks of transactions to the network, with a special block header proving they spent sufficient resources to prevalidate the transactions. 
And yes, fees for settlement transactions are more than enough to sustain miners. Remember, miners chose what transactions to include in their blocks. There's no reason they can't set a limit and only build profitable blocks, and if your transaction doesn't meet their minimum threshold, they don't include it. This has always been the case. Bitcoin is not a charity for the miners nor for the users. Everyone acts in their own economic self interest which is what makes the system work.

@_date: 2017-11-21 22:29:12


But it is. That's how bitcoin has always changed was through BIPs. You're fooling yourself if you think anyone has ever proposed a serious block size increase. Bcash is a joke. Not even 6 months old and needs an emergency hard fork, when it forked from perfectly working code. 


Like I said, that's on a list of about 20 other items that also need to be fixed with a hard fork. Are we going to fork 20 times? Include more than one item in the fork and then we will talk. 


Sorry, but the reason bcash is "working great" is because there's no volume. Every block is less than 1MB. You know what else is instant and free? Dogecoin? Hell even Litecoin, and they have Segwit. 
Secondly, it's not feasible to have world volume on a propagating network and remain decentralized, while doing it entirely on chain. Let's assume just 20% of the world population is using it. And let's be conservative and say they are only spending 50 times per month. And let's assume the absolute minimum transaction with one input, making it about 226 bytes. Those blocks would be 3.5GB. Every 10 minutes. 
"Oh that's easy" you say... no it isn't. It's not a single computer we are talking about, it's a network of decentralized computer, ideally computers that anyone has access to. Not only do you have to download the block, but you also need to verify that block, and then reupload that block to at least 2 other nodes to have a network effect and propagate, and those nodes will need to do the same. As node count increases or block size increase, this becomes substantially harder. 
[Here]( is a post that explains the situation quite well. Remember we are talking about billions of people here each with many many transactions. 
So, block size will increase, after we reduce transaction size, and increase transaction fungibility. Both of which are in the works, unfortunately haulted by miners playing silly games. 
But have fun with bcash. I suspect it will be neckbeard money equivalent to the N64 in terms of gaming systems. A nice antique, but not the financial platform of the future. Not with simpletons like Ver running the show.

No, Coinbase uses unique addresses generated from an extended public key, and then relates funds sent to that address to your account.
You don't have bitcoins if you have a balance only on Coinbase. You have an entry in a third party ledger, with the general understanding that they will later send them to you or some other address if requested. But any coins that are sent to "your address" with Coinbase actually are not there and get rolled up into larger aggregate addresses, because it's cheaper to send a single large input to many addresses, than many inputs to a single/many addresses. 
If you ever try to get money out of Coinbase, and it comes with an input of like 50+ BTC, it's because Coinbase is authorizing the release of coins, from their own stash of coins.

Obviously the exact opposite can happen, and past events do not have any actual bearing on future events, however, accounting for past performance over the recent time period, the chances of it going up on you are far beyond that of it going down on you. And thus your potential for starting off with a substantial unknown loss is far beyond any known loss you would take for a fee.

Yes a paper wallet can have multiple UTXOs on a single address, and not all of them have to be sent. The advantage of having a paper wallet is that the key is not on a network attached device, which is immediately killed the second that you load it into a node to spend. You don't have to spend all the UTXOs, but on the slight chance your device was compromised any remaining UTXOs are easily gotten. 
A hardware wallet is not network attached, but it has the capability of signing transactions, so it can be reused repeatedly. A paper wallet can't sign transactions. That's the point I'm making. When done properly, a paper wallet is marginally safer for long term storage because of less possible attack vectors. But generating/importing paper wallet keys into a computer obliterates the purpose and it becomes a warm wallet. In order to retain the same level of security, remaining UTXOs should be sent to a newly, correctly generated paper wallet. But it is entirely possible to spent partial UTXOs on a paper wallet... not advised, but entirely possible.

Transactions are simply serialized chunks of information. A typical signed transaction takes about 226 bytes, and looks like 226 random letters, or basically a paragraph worth of random letters. 
With that, and node can input it. You could print it out and mail it. You could SMS it. You could use a carrier pigeon. You could hook it up to a telegraph and send it via Morse code. You could use smoke signals. 
All that is required is that you communicate those random letters to someone else. The internet obviously makes the best bet for this, but there's no reason you can't use some other means to communicate to a node not in an oppressive state, and then have your transaction broadcast that way.

Imagine you and I have a spreadsheet. We don't talk to each other, but we have the same spreadsheet to keep track of who owns what. If we make the exact same changes to the spreadsheet in the exact same order, we will end up with the same spreadsheet after making those changes. 
The only way we change our spreadsheets, is by mandating people make a properly formatted transaction. Further, the miners must group only properly formed transactions in a properly formed block in exchange for money in our spreadsheet. If anything isn't to our format rules, the entire group of transactions is voided and the miner gets no money. 
One day, a miner decides to break one of my formatting rules, but it follows your rules because your rules allow something that mine don't. You see the block as a valid block with valid transactions and change your spreadsheet accordingly. I see it as invalid and ignore it. You and I now have different, incompatible spreadsheets. They are the same up until the point that we decided one block was valid/invalid, but ever since that block, certain transactions aren't going to be valid on both chains. This will get more and more pronounced with time. 
Bitcoin is forking because people are not agreeing on the rules and instead see the current version of the spreadsheet different than another group. Who's is worth more is up to the market. If it is only me with a different version, chances are it won't be worth anything. If it is a large enough group of people, they would assign it some level of value and move forward with it.

That's not how markets work. The "price" is typically the last price it sold at, or at least an average.
There's people buying bitcoin, and people selling bitcoin. If you wanted to sell 30,000 bitcoin and keep the same price, you would need people to buy the 30,000 bitcoin at the price you are selling it at. That could take a while. Or, you could sell to the people who has listed prices they are willing to buy at, typically lower than the going price or someone would have sold to them already, which would subsequently drop the price. But there's not going to be a magical button to just press that says "sell" with that amount no.

I could see it taking about as much effort/starting capital as starting to mine, assuming you have good electricity prices. More than starting up one on the weekend, but not so much that it would take millions. A serious dedication and a few K can easily start a viable option. 
And yes, fee prices will be driven down drastically, given that a hop is a hop no matter who it does through, so beyond reliability, price of fee is the only other way to compete.
The way I see it, the probability of being used as a hop depends on your connectivity, capacity in a channel, and fee for your hop. Any wallet is going to request possible paths, and pick the cheapest viable path. If you have more connections with different hubs, the chances of being in a path increases. If you have more money in a channel, the chances of being able to carry any particular transaction increases. The lower you set your fees the higher the chance of being used in a hop is. 
Anyone looking to start a hub will likely open connections with other people, namely other people that have other open connections. They could collaborate and "pool" to form lower transaction fees on common paths. And most importantly, keeping channels "balanced" will be beneficial to hub operators.
I see variable rates on channels playing a big roll. The more you send in one direction, the less chance you have of using sending more in that direction. You can change your fees, so that sending in one direction is more than sending in the other direction. Interestingly enough, you can even set a negative fee, so it may be worth paying a few satoshis to not have to close and reopen a new channel. All of this is conjecture, and I'm currently researching this as an option. 
Also, I see QoS playing a roll, where certain channels carry certain transactions like &gt;$5 or &lt;$.001.
Finally cooperation amongst hubs could result in side chain settling, and balancing the channel manually. 
All of this has zero negative affect on users. If you fear any of this, you could simply blacklist the nodes taking part in this. LN does not depend on this at all. In fact, using such services will most likely result in less on chain transactions being required (smaller blocks)/lower on chain fees, better LN fees due to optimization, and better reliability in finding a possible path to any particular person. 
Overall, I have zero fear in centralization on the LN because it's entirely voluntary.

I'm not sure what you mean by that. At no point is LN depending on trust. Effectively, opening a channel entails locking the funds in a multisignature account that has a lot of conditions on closing, particularly the requirement of a "closing" transaction that specifies the ending amount going to each address. 
When transactions are made, a new "update" transaction is signed, and given to the other party. This party can either close the channel by posting this transaction to the blockchain, or can hold onto it if they want to. You can also post your copy of this transaction and close the channel with this new state from your side. If you try and cheat, and post an older version, the other party can simply post the newer one, and as part of the opening contract rules, collect all the funds in the channel. Ideally it will be so easy to do this, that it will not even be worth it to try, similar to a 51% attack in bitcoin. 
Each and every one of these channel updates is signed the same as any other transaction. What I'm saying is, in order to be used as a hop, there would likely be latency between accessing the hardware wallet, but it doesn't make it impossible to use one. Especially if the timeout time is conducive to it.

That may be their stated purpose, but central banks have been at 0 or negative interest rate policies for a decade now. This next dip is going to hurt.

It's like losing in a race, with your pedal to the medal, and the opponent still pulling away from you. Pushing harder on the pedal won't hurt. 
The point of that video is more to highlight the purpose of deleveraging a Keynesian driven economy that is over leveraged. We didn't do that. The world didn't do that. Instead, they doubled down on debt and propped the economy up. Debt is like lighter fluid and if nothing catches by the time it runs out, you've got problems. Every penny of that stimulus money went into the stock market, fueling a rise (stock market inflation), and consumer prices haven't been affected. As that money is pulled out however, and spent in the economy, prices will be affected, and things will get bad. We are headed for rapid inflation, and Yellen knows it, hence why she's already cranking up interest rates. The problem is, this time, there's bitcoin, and many people aren't going to be forced to buy a bailout through inflation this time.

It's a massive fallacy to believe that gold has some crazy industrial consumption driving its value. Less than 12% of all gold produced is used for industrial purposes, and that amount decreases daily. 9 of those 12% are actually for dentistry believe it or not, for fillings, mostly for cosmetic reasons. 
50% is used for jewelry, but it's not like other materials don't have as good or superior jewelry making properties anymore. The reason gold is used in jewelry is because it is expensive and it's a show of wealth. And gold is used in trace values, if at all in electronics anymore. We don't live in a digital age where signal quality is a serious issue anymore. The entire reason gold is worth 3x what it cost to produce is for speculative purposes, particularly as an inflation hedge. In fact 35% of all gold produced is used for the dedicated purpose of investment/speculation, and 90+% of that is in an ETF. So if bitcoin usurps gold in its store of value properties (and all that would take is for the world to recognize it as a universal symbol of value that not everyone will just sell off tomorrow), then there's absolutely no reason why bitcoin wouldn't also usurp a significant portion of gold's investment market, dropping the price of gold, which also drops its reason to be used in show of wealth jewelry and you get a feedback loop. 
And again, you don't get to just point to a nonexistent replacement and say it *will* happen. Is it possible to happen? Sure. But I believe it is highly unlikely, because its replacement would also need to be open access, permission-less, and open source, while overcoming the bootstrapping issue that all cryptocurrencies must overcome, all without bitcoin just deciding to steal its open source code if things got close enough. Bitcoin the asset is a network state. How we decide to change that state is the protocol, which is the technology, and that can and does change all the time. But like I said, if bitcoin becomes a universally understood symbol of value (well on its way), you aren't going to convince people to simply abandon that network state and any wealth they have stored in it overnight for 2.0. The switch from MySpace to Facebook required very little sacrifice from the end user. Switching the very fundamental value structure of your life is a substantial change that many will simply not do. I believe bitcoin will always have competition, but so does the USD and it seems to be doing just fine in relation to its competition.

The real solution is to simply separate users from having to deal with a fee market, and have them using L2. If they can't understand the basics of what fees are in bitcoin, then "centralization" of their end user product is irrelevant. If anyone has not programmed their own wallet software from scratch and only deal with OTC markets, they are contributing to some level of centralization and that's ok. You don't care about the price of fuel gas at the power plant as long as when you plug your computer in, it turns on, and you are paying a reasonable bill every month. The difference in this situation is anyone can compete with the local power company without permission from some central authority. 
Centralization isn't necessarily bad. Forced participation in centralization, i.e. monopolies are bad. And the only way to avoid that is to keep barriers to entry low, and keep things open access on the base layer to promote competition on the centralized layer. I want my grandma to be able to call up a customer service rep when something goes bad, for my own sake. I just want the company that customer service rep works for to have fierce competition because the barrier to entry is so low.

All modern day economies are built on the concept of giving you no other options but to either have your currency inflated away,  spend it, "invest" in a shaky stock market, or not get inflated away as quickly with low yield "safe" investments like money market funds and bonds. In their model, if people can't save effectively, they must keep working, doing productive things, and buying things they don't need so that companies can continue to post earnings quarter after quarter. It's systemic slavery. 
The system literally depends on the ability to not be able to get ahead unless you are close to the source of the newly created money and can spend it before prices inflate. Banks and the government get money first and dump it into the market and military/welfare spending. Look at the bail out in 2008. 8T added to the economy and all that happened was the stock market prices increased (inflation local to the stock market). Meanwhile, income levels never changed because there's no extra productivity happening. Once profits are taken from the market, consumer inflation will hit. Inflation lags the introduction of money, but the introduction of money will raise prices.
Bitcoin offers an easy way out. Before, they could just make gold hard to get, deal with, confiscatable,  and really just point at gold bugs as crazy conspiracy theorists. Bitcoin is easy to access. If bitcoin becomes easily accessible, now people have an alternative to their debt driven, inflation and overconsumption driven society. People can bail out. That breaks their system that depends on there being no other option. If bitcoin takes off, a lot of debt obligations won't be filled and there will be economic consequences overall.

First off, it is not the single computer we are concerned about, it's network propagation. Let's assume median transaction size of 226 bytes. 1GB blocks would then be 4.75e6 transactions per block. Let's assume each transaction requires 1 ms per transaction to process (it has to run through the script). That would mean it would take 4751 seconds to process all the transactions in a block... that's 1.31 hours. Not only do you have only 10 minutes to download the block and verify, but in order to actually work that block needs to be propagated which means it needs to be uploaded to another node (or 2 at least really), which needs to also verify and upload. All of this needs to happen in 10 minutes or less.


What's your goal in 10 years? Because if it's a global currency, let's assume 1/2 the world population and give them about 50 txs a piece per month. Pretty conservative for "cash" but I'll play to your end. 
7.2B/2 x 50 tx  x 226 bytes / 30 days / 24 hours/ 6 blocks / 1024^3 = 17.53 GB. Even 1 B people, it's 2.43 GB blocks. And that's not even with micro transactions. That's just conservative spending habits for &amp;lt;15% of the world population. You are right, balancing LN channels will be crucial to minimize opening and closing, and unfortunately, that won't be enough either. But one thing is for sure, on chain scaling is an issue, and LN is better than pure on chain scaling.

Bullshit. In fact, it's a basic computer science fact that blocksize increase results in *some level* of centralization. No one who actually understands argues that. The argument is *how much is permissible*. Maybe my dial up, internet connected fridge doesn't need to run a node. That's permissible centralization.

I don't think you understand how bitcoin works. Hash power is required to even put forth a block that won't get you blocked immediately, and if your block doesn't meet everyone else's individual rules, they ignore it individually. 
It would be like you copying and pasting our spreadsheet, changing everything and coming back and giving it to us as the update... anyone can take a quick look at it, and tell you to fuck off.
And the amount of money, time, and effort required to aquire the hardware to get 51% would be hundreds of billions of dollars and could not be done covertly. The most an attack could do would be stall the chain or double spend, at which point we just simply change the POW algorithm and carry on as usual. 
If it could be stopped it would have been stopped already.

At best, even without the problems of an EDA, BCH is a novelty coin at best. It is quite literally impossible to scale to any substantial level and remain decentralized, *and try and compete with cash*. Average Visa levels alone would require 250MB blocks as the theoretical minimum, 0 conf transactions are never safe and thus it takes at least 10 minutes for transaction (expect that to rise as orphans increase as block sizes balloon), BCH will always be 100% traceable with a mathematical proof of spending (removing plausible deniability), and it will always have a fee if supply is to remain fixed. You can't have free transactions with a diminishing block reward and even if you could, how do you compensate miners when the reward finally disappears?
So with all of that said, please explain how a centralized node network, that requires at least 10 minutes to transact securely, will always require a fee, and is 100% provably traceable compares with cash, much less something like bitcoin with LN?

No, I said there is an absolute supply. Not artificial. There's literally an absolute supply as long as you can't find a way to sneak a few extra integers between the real numbers of 0 and 21M.


That's exactly my point. There is an *absolutely fixed supply*. When the value of the currency increases, we simply expect prices to decrease. This isn't an issue in bitcoin, because we can very easily subdivide, and get a smaller portion of the overall value. ***You are the one who says that deflation is an issue here***. I'm saying it isn't at all.


Wtf are you talking about? I said there is *absolute scarcity*. You're the one saying it is "artificial".


 You are very clearly confused here. If I have 1 slice out of a pie, with 100 slices, if the pie grows, my portion grows as well. But if I can't divide my slice further, then we have an issue in how we pay people to keep an economy growing. If I can divide my slices further, then who cares if my 1 slice gets absolutely massive? Prices are a reflection of money in circulation, so prices would just decrease accordingly. As I introduce more of my stored value, prices would increase accordingly. Over time, the ability/desire to swing prices massively will be greatly diminished.

There's nothing in the LN protocol dictating where the PK needs to be stored in order to sign transactions, so there's no resin hardware wallets couldn't be used. 


Hmmm, I guess I've never really thought about the latency of signing a transaction from a hardware wallet as a factor, but I guess it would be. Still, there's no real reason why hardware wallets couldn't be made in the form of PCI express cards, with quick access to transfer transactions to and from it to be signed. A hardware wallet simply ensures there's no feasible way for the key to touch some sort of point of access, only transactions can go in and come out signed. In a profitable scenario such as a hub, it may be worth the CapEx to develop "fast access hardware wallets" that operate under the same principal. 


Not sure what you mean by this, but under the scenario I laid out above, and even with something like a Trezor, the functionality simply isn't there to request access to the keys. Keys are used to electronically sign, and never leave the storage place. You could feasibly make it extremely quick to transfer a transaction to be signed, sign it with the key, and then transfer it back on a spare PCI slot. 




You do have a valid point on latency between  keys signing transactions and forwarding, but there is a "timeout" in the protocol that it gives leniency to latency across a network. If this became an issue I don't think anyone would be opposed to a slight increase in working time before timeout if it meant for substantially more security. Users won't recognize the difference between 1 second transactions and 3 second transactions, but for computer latency that could be years worth of leniency.
You do have me interested in timeouts due to signing however. I'll have to look into that as well.

Running more than one node is stupid, and even more so if you aren't actually transacting. The amount of weight really depends on your view of the consensus rules in relation to the rest of the economy. 
In UASF, there was what at least appears to be (we can never know for sure) a significant portion of the economic population choosing a set of consensus rules to follow, which would have led to a fork. A Sybil attack is different from gaining a general/sizable consensus on what the consensus rules should be imo. If we just called every group of people with similar consensus rules a Sybil attack, then bitcoin itself would be one giant Sybil attack against anyone who disagreed. 
Regardless, bitcoin is much more than anything that can be measured by a single metric. It is a distributed network coming to consensus on the state of "bitcoin" every 10 minutes. "Bitcoin" is what *you and you alone* decide to believe it is by your own consensus rules. If you disagreed with UASF, yet kept the consensus rules that would allow for a wipeout, then that is entirely your own issue, because those are the consensus rules that you applied. 
Likewise, anyone who is subject to a replay attack is allowing for the consensus rules that allow for that, so it is their own responsibility to protect themselves from it. 
Bottom line is, *you control what bitcoin is* from your own vantage point entirely through your consensus rules. Whether the market agrees with you or not is an entirely different story, and puts emphasis on keeping the status quo, however, it is possible to change if you garner the proper support. I don't believe S2X has garnered the proper support to change the vast majority's viewpoint on what constitutes "bitcoin". I could be wrong, but my money is riding on me being right.

So, transactions are made up of the outputs of previous transactions called "**U**nspent **TX** **O**utputs) (UTXOs), and the creation of new outputs. Let's say I get my paycheck and then want to pay you for surgery. If we did this on chain, my transaction would point to my paycheck transaction as the input (let's say 10 BTC for fun), and then it would make two new outputs. One would be to you for the amount of the surgery, and the other would be to an address I control, as the change... I don't want to send 10 BTC for a surgery that cost 1BTC. 
That transaction is just like a written check. Just because I write it out really means nothing. You could lose the check, I may not actually have the funds, I could write two checks pointing to the same funds and whichever one goes to clear later would bounce. It's crucial to understand that unverified transactions mean nothing. They can be trivially created. I could create 1000s of bad transactions in a few seconds right now. 
So when I create that transaction, I then broadcast it out. It reaches a node (or leaves my node) which forwards it to another 10 nodes, which all forwards it to another 10 etc etc until a miner sees it. It lives in a limbo state in the mempool, like a bank keeping a bunch of not yet processed checks in a box to be processed. 
The problem is, transactions take up computer space. And they include code which proves the ownership of the tokens, which takes time to run. So if millions of other people are sending in transactions, the bank (miners) has a lot of work ahead of them to decide who and what goes first. Especially when I can spam them and quite easily drop off pallets worth of phone paper checks for no real cost to me. So we have to come up with a situation where we decide what is "spam" and what isn't. There's two ways of doing this: a central authority who comes up with rules for what is spam/isn't,  or a market.
Let's say, there's a lot of transactions rolling in, but I have a very important transaction to send. I don't want my transaction to pay for a surgery getting caught behind someone's coffee payment. I, form my transaction in a way, that points to my 10 BTC, pays you the 1BTC for the surgery, but then only returns 8.9 BTC to me, leaving .1 BTC unallocated. Well, the miner can then allocate that .1 BTC to themselves. All of the sudden, they have a very good reason to include my transaction, over a transaction with no fee or a fee satoshi's. 
When a miner puts together a block, all they do is group up transactions, make sure each is valid, and then they put it in a rigid form that everyone agrees upon the rules. Miners can chose whatever transactions they want from the mempool. Then, they basically cycle a number called a "nonce" and hash the block over and over until they "hit the lottery". Once they do, they broadcast that block and we can quickly check both the block header, and the block of transactions. This setup keeps the network from being spammed with bad blocks, of bad transactions, costing everyone money. If we get a block, we can very easily see if it has enough work by simply looking at the block hash. Then we can check that hash just as quick. If it fails those tests, we don't even bother with the transactions. If it passes those tests, we then test each and every transaction. We can rest reasonably assured that they will all check out because mining a block with a valid header is expensive so there's really no reason to also include a bad transaction. 
Once we check the block against all of our rules, we see that as the next network update and update our ledger accordingly. 
The reason we can't just include all of the transactions is because each and every node needs to check each and every transaction individually. That's only after they download the block, and then they have to upload it to another 10 or so nodes who do the same. And every single node has to come to agreement within 10 minutes otherwise we start forking like crazy. This is why we have to wait 30 minutes now, is because we already fork 3-4 times a week with 1MB blocks. For reference, the theorhetical minimum block size for Visa level transactions alone would be 250MB. Under realistic conditions, it would be around 1GB. That your computer would have to download, run through each transaction individually (storing all of them in RAM), and then uploading to 10 other nodes. All within 10 minutes. Without heavy duty hardware, this isn't possible. Is that to say 2MB isn't possible? No. But there's been research done not too long ago that shows 4MB is pretty much the upper limit right now, which is also the theoretical upper limit on Segwit. Storage is the least of our concerns with block size. Pruning is easy. RAM usage is intensive, and bandwidth is intensive. The solution isn't to scale linearly, it is to optimize what the blockchain is used for, and then scale linearly once we've optimized as much as we can. 
If I run a LN hub, and I charge a penny for a transaction, I may be able to run 10000 transactions off chain before I need to settle. In that case, I have no problem paying $5-10 for a transaction fee, if I stand to make ~$100. And if the barrier to entry is small enough (you don't need permission to run a bitcoin node, and with small enough blocks it's not too expensive) then anyone can run a LN node and the consumer wins from competition. But with 1GB blocks, now I need to pay for access from a node provider (that level of hardware is expensive they won't be doing it for free), and only if they want to do business with me.
So back to your original question, fees are simply a market rate, chosen as the difference between inputs and outputs by the creator of the transaction. If I can wait for lower volume time, I send a lower fee. If it's urgent, is send a higher fee. The miners choose transactions, so if there's thousands of higher fee transactions, then the chance of your no fee transaction going through is pretty minimum. In fact, most mining pools today have minimum fee levels set, because free/cheap transactions aren't worth their time effort to even store in their mempool. So with that logic, if a miner's operation take $500/month to run, you can bet they won't be accepting transactions that don't even pay for their operation. 
Edit: I also would like to add, the fee selection is a tricky game and isn't something most people are used to, so wallets include fee estimator algorithms, but these are basically the same algorithms that high frequency trade robots use, and a good one is not easy to make at all. What ends up happening (currently), is because the desire to "shield" the end user from the complexity of fees, the wallet will take the highest/fastest fee block and add a few percentage points up, ensuring a fast transaction. But now that fee affects the fee levels, and everyone else's algorithm reacts accordingly increasing theirs, and we get a feedback loop. There's many times, when there's a very high "fast" fee, and a very low "normal fee" and both fast and normal transactions get through because all of them fit. This is what happens with runaway fee guessing algorithms, and it's the problem with having end users send payments directly on chain. 
The end user solution can't be to send payments onchain because it simply is too complex for what end users expect from the system. Choosing a market rate for transactions and waiting for chain confirmations and mempools an replace by fees and... you get the picture. Grandma don't give a shit. The best solution is to make it 100% open access for anyone who wants to deal with that, however to allow solutions to be built on top that can effectively manage transaction fee markets and timing. If I run a transaction layer, and need to settle, I can time my settlement to go through on my own time watch, according to my own strategy, and I deal with the fees and viability of it all. Grandma just uses my end user platform, and pays me whatever my profit model is, and everyone is happy. You don't give a shit what the going rate for fuel gas is for the powerplant as long as you can plug your phone in to charge and you can pay a reasonable, predictable bill. The difference is, in this situation, it costs a few hundred dollars to set up your own powerplant and there's no permits required, so you can offer competition, keeping the other power companies (payment layers) honest.

There's no promissory note, it is a smart contract that only releases funds with the secret that the payee generates. And in order for the payee to get their money they need to post that secret. Even if they don't play well and don't send it to all parties, it is publicly available for anyone to see if they want their funds. 
In other words, money never actually changes hands until the payee gets their money, and then everyone changes at once because all contracts are simultaneously fulfilled by the same conditions. If someone doesn't transfer money to the next node, the contracts just expire.

Well I guess I can't fix stupid. I thought that was pretty clear. 


[The median block size for BCH is far below 8MB]( Start putting out continuous 8MB blocks and then we will talk. 


Since it's abundantly clear at this point that you don't understand how bitcoin actually works, let me lay out "n" for you. ["N" is actually the amount of computational cycles/resources required for any algorithm.](
Bitcoin transactions have inputs and outputs. Those outputs have an encumbrance script, locking it to any particular public key, and in order to use it as an input in another transaction, you need to sign it accordingly. It is very very common to have multiple addresses for every transaction from a wallet software. In fact, if your wallet is recycling addresses, it's a security risk. So each and every time you receive bitcoin, you have a new address and a new signature. So like paying for food with 5 $1 bills is still $5, 10x .1BTC is still 1BTC. Except the difference is the bitcoin transaction needs 10 different signatures. So for a single transaction, the computer is doing 10x the work. So now, when you linearly scale, if you have 10 transactions with 10 signatures a piece, your computer now needs to handle 100 signatures. With Segwit, all the signatures are in a separate block, which is optional, but mathematically provable to exist. So for 10 transactions with 10 signatures a piece shows up as a single signature at worst, and can be fully verified at any point where you choose. BCH doesn't get that advantage. It's a shame I need to explain Big O notation to someone who is so arrogant about computer knowledge. 


Hint: *Quadratically increasing functions aren't limited to just squaring*...
Do yourself a favor and read that link on big O notation, you'll save yourself the embarrassment in the future. 


Ok. Clearly you've never run a node. Also, you understand that cycling through hashes linearly is different from running script correct?


I don't know how else to answer this except for "Lol." It's cringeworthy how arrogant you are for being so wrong at the same time. 


So all I have to do is flood the mempool with transactions pointing to all the UTXOs and I can freeze up BCH? Good to know. 


Mempools are respective to the node running it. At any point in time, there's no saying your mempool is the same as mine. That's why blocks even exist. 
I'm done responding. Clearly you are overconfident in your lack of knowledge and aren't open to actually learning why it is that you are wrong so I'm not going to try anymore. I'll just let you crash and burn with the rest of them, and when BCH needs to continuously increase block sizes, you'll eventually remember this conversation and it will all click. For everyone else, they'll just look at this dialog between us and recognize that you are clearly well beyond your ability in this discussion.

Bitcoin has a programming language built into how it is locked called Script. The normal script locks the coins to a public key, and can only be spent with a signature that corresponds.
There's no limit or standard structure that any scriptsig needs to follow, as long as it returns TRUE at the end rather than FALSE at any time, the UTXO is spendable.
So bitcoin has the ability to lock coins from being spent before a particular Unix Epoch time, or a certain block. Just another reason why programmable money is more valuable than fiat.

Transactions are very simply formatted, and your private keys sign the transaction, so what you end up with is a serialized block of data, that authorizes a transaction, similar to filling out and signing a check. The money isn't transferred until the transaction clears. The signed transaction carries no sensitive data and can be sent to a node in anyway that you can send a chunk of 250-300 characters, including pencil and paper if need be.
So with that, all that is required is user input for amount/where to send, a cache of private keys, and some sort of data transfer protocol that doesn't need to be secure. It's best that it is kept undefined and simple like this, keeping innovation avenues open.
With regards to your example of tapping a phone, that's entirely possible using NFC to communicate the user input, the phone is capable of storing keys and signing transactions, and then NFC can communicate a signed transaction back. 
There's going to be many different combinations of these user/input, tx signing, broadcasting steps, combining old and new technologies to make it as simple on the end user as possible. Rest assured that if there's a way to make something better or more efficient, an actual free market will find a way to make it happen. It's important that bitcoin remains decentralized to be an actual free market though, because if parties can then dictate how this user/input, tx signing, broadcasting steps need to take place, they can coerce the system to use their own soliton, which is not longer a free market and innovation is hampered.

Trying to KYC/AML bitcoin is and will continue to get more and more like trying to regulate email. It's simply not enforceable. They can put whatever regulations they want, but the sheer cost of tracking everything, vs the minimal cost of making such a job magnitudes harder is ridiculously off balance. 
Sure with enough effort they will be able to track down individual payees just like they can track down emails with enough dedicated effort, but the vast vast majority of activity will be largely regarded as too expensive to go after. Who's to say one tx is buying a video game or an oz of weed? It's not possible on an aggregate level that would be required.

Understood, no hard feelings. 


No, your money is in a multisignature wallet that is no more or less secure than any other wallet. Your keys to that wallet can be stored on a hardware wallet just the same. All that's happening is you are sending the coins to an output that has contractural conditions attached to it.


I wouldn't equate it to a bank. Banks fractionally reserve lend which isn't possible with LN. Think of it more like keeping your coins in something like a CD or a savings account. Sure there'd be some money required to actually make money, but it's proportional. You can still make money with a very small amount. It's just like any business opportunity. Your costs would include initial hardware (not very hardware intensive), an internet connection, electricity, and opening and closing channel fees (which can be strategically minimized). Working capital wouldn't really be a cost, because it's an asset. Like I said, with as little as $5k you could very easily be making a few dollars a day if you wanted. You could pitch the case for $50-$100k business loan and make it even more. And there's no certifications needed, no one can price you out, and you don't need to ask anyone for permission. Permissionless innovation is always benificial.

In not referring to bugs or mistakes. I'm referring to literal differences of opinions. We can't even come to consensus on a few million people with a block size increase. You want hundreds of millions of people to come to agreement on taxes? How does that not just turn into mob rule? Of course the Lower 51% are going to coerce the upper 49%, and when they become the upper 51%, what's to stop them from just remaining superior? Literally a real life example of 51% attack with no bail out option. Talk about oppression of minorities. 


Ya you're going to have to source such a fringe claim. That's not at all true. 
What would you call the black market? Just because a free market self enforces winners and losers doesn't make it a problem. I would say that if someone is objectively decreasing poverty, we should give them more power over decisions than someone who isn't. I don't want a democracy in the surgical operating room. If you ask a homeless guy and someone knowledgable in treating poverty whether we should just gift $50k or put it towards development, you are going to get drastic answers on which is better. Most people simply don't know what's right for them. If that's the case, I have no problem with people gaining power positions in certain decisions through performing well in a free market. 
Do you get to just go submit code merges to core Willy Nilly? What happens if someone from core abuses their power? Perfect example of how a free market can self regulate. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:47:29
That's an interesting question, and technically not really because your maximum amount you can receive from any channel is fixed by the amount you put in. More likely, whatever wallet provider which has LN, will act as a certain counterparty, holding any funds that you have in surplus, and you can release them to a wallet at anytime you choose. 
In venmo for example, if someone pays me money, it just shows up as a balance available for spending. I can chose to have it sent via ACH at anytime however. 
That's my take on it. There may be better solutions already implemented, but if I was a wallet designer, that's how I would do it.

A fee is optional. Now, if you want to have your transaction included in a block, you have to compete on the market for space, and a fee is the best way to do that. Space in a block is a limited/scarce resource. That's the price we pay for decentralization. If you want fast and easy, have a single centralized ledger. But bitcoin is not a charity.
Fees are also based on the computer data size (bytes) of the transaction, not the amount sent. Traditional systems take a percentage. This is why it makes much more sense for bitcoin to become the base level transaction layer, that daily transactions are settled on. Because anyone settling funds most likely has a much larger amount being sent, and by percentage it is far far cheaper than to send a micropayment. And for larger transactions, bitcoin is far cheaper than wiring services would be, and you don't have to have anyone's permission to send them. 
Like it or not on chain bitcoin simply isn't viable for small valued transactions. It will, from now on always have a fee if you want to send in a reasonable amount of time. That's the price we pay for a fixed supply. Someone has to pay the miners, and if the block reward decreases, that payment has to come from someone else. Again, bitcoin is not a charity.

That's much more tolerable in a currency than rapid deflation.
Sure if your smallest denomination is a physical disc of copper.


When prices get so low, we don't have the problem of literally running out of money like we did in the Great Depression. We simply drop down a decimal place and move on. Sound money without the possibility of a economy not having enough money to circulate. The decrease in money supply, was actually the rapid decrease in balance sheets and credit, which was artificially created value anyways. Talk about your circular argument theory.


Just because we define a mathematical set into discrete subdivisions of value doesn't mean anything is artificial. Please do explain how you fit *absolutely* more integers between 0 and 21M. If you aren't comfortable with the idea of a bitcoin, try 1 BTC = 1/21e4% of the overall valuation that we universally attribute to bitcoin. If that becomes the underlying understanding of value, then 1 BTC = 1/21e4% of all value in the world. Now, if that happens to become a reality, wouldn't you say 0-$7k over 8 years is actually pretty slow?


No the difference is that bitcoin was first, created with a serious goal in mind, and all the technological advancements are happening on bitcoin. Also, if I go to Nigeria, the changes of someone understanding "bitcoin" are much higher than someone understanding the phrase "dogecoin". Remember, demand gives something value. If someone is willing to exchange something of value to me for bitcoin, then you cannot logically tell me that it does't have value.


Because every single fiat currency is based off the idea that it is valuable, because other people see at as valuable. So if you are using such an argument to discredit bitcoin, you are effectively dismissing all currencies. So does the USD have value or not? Because it runs on the exact same principals as bitcoin and the Venezuelan bolívar. You don't just get to pick and chose arbitrarily in a logical argument. The only difference between the 3 is that no one wants the bolivar because they don't trust it will have any value in the future... which is "circular" because that's what gives it its value. Hence the rapid decrease in value.

This is to conform with BOLT standards which are mutually agreed upon standards for all implementations to meet so they interact with each other. LN won't have consensus rules, so rather than having 3 different LNs competing, they all choose to interact on common ground. Imagine if iPhones could only call other iPhones and Samsungs could only call other samsungs. 
This is a very good sign because it means that pretty much everyone meets the requirements to be able to play well with each other, and everyone has their own working implementation.
Keep in mind this is also just the underlying implementation software, so UX layers will still need to be built on top. I've been playing around with lnd, and can open/close channels, send payments, send multiphop payments etc reliably, however it requires using a CLI. There's some active development to implement this into wallets but again, it takes time.

[BCH is not bitcoin.]( Clear enough for you?


Really? Where are the results to these tests? Because just over 1 year ago, [bitfury pretty conclusively showed that 4MB was the safe limit.]( So I guess that really depends on your definition of "current gen hardware". Sure enterprise servers can run large blocks. They don't have too many of those in SE Asia however. 


Really? Because I'm going to assume you won't actually read the paper I linked, and the fact that you think big blocks is the way to go I'll assume you have limited knowledge of how bitcoin works, so I'll sum it up. Downloading is just the first part. You also need to validate the block. Each transaction. Individually. You need to run the encumbrance script for every input. Meaning you need to hash out every signature. Storing them all in RAM, which is by far the most intensive part of running a node. For multisignature transactions (most of them, especially anything complex), this makes it a quadratic problem. Since it is *you* who *clearly* understands "modern computing" you should understand that means it is an O(n^2 ) problem. So explain the logic behind O(n) scaling again? And oh yeah, once you run through the transactions, and verify everything, you have to upload it about 10x over so that other nodes can also download verify and upload. And every single node on the network needs to do this all within 10 minutes. Good luck, considering we orphan 3-4 times a week with small blocks already. 


Really? Because let's take a basic one input, 2 output transaction, which has a median size of 226 bytes. Visa [does 1971 tx per second]( on average for the year. Meaning it is substantially higher than that during the holidays. Let's assume all one input 2 output transactions, and pretend multisignature operations don't exist and aren't a problem (they do, and they are). At 1971 txs/s x 600 sec/block x 226 bytes / 1024 b/kb /1024 kb/mb = 254.88 MB. Remember that quadratic assumption we made? Go ahead and multiply that by at least 4. So you are telling me, that bitcoin cash is going to be "the currency of the internet and the people of the world", but you won't need capacity to compete with Visa alone? Forget ACH, venmo, PayPal, fiat, wiring, etc. we're just talking about credit card transactions for the ~1B people who have a credit card. There's 7B people in the world. Good luck with that. 


Again, an elementary mistake by someone who clearly doesn't understand how bitcoin works. RBF is a wallet functionality that takes advantage of how bitcoin works. I can generate thousands of invalid transactions on BCH right now and broadcast them out. I could very easily, generate a transaction for a payment amount, and your 0 conf wallet would see it as unconfirmed. And I could trivially just as easily create a new transaction, with a higher fee, with the same UTXOs to myself, and broadcast it as well. When both txs are in the mempool, which one do you think the miner's greedy algorithm is going after? So by the time the second one (your 0 conf) one goes to clear, guess who's not getting any money. IOUs are good for smallish payments as well, but we don't build a global economy on them. 


Jesus Christ are you serious? You realize there's people sitting in jail for Silk Road related activities because their activities were traced on bitcoin. People watch Satoshi's account like a hawk.

Because once again, I think for myself and don't let idiotic conspiracy theories get in the way of logic. All signs for me point to long chain scaling being the only real viable option over the long term. 


No one is spending bitcoin before it gets close to its SOV market price, which is several orders of magnitude away. Gold backed fiat didn't just become a thing overnight. It developed over hundreds of years. LN will be the fiat equivalent transfer form of the backing asset bitcoin, and it will happen in less than 2 years. No, I'm not worried at all. I have Venmo in the meantime, which is instant and free, something BCH can't do long term.

Bitcoin is not critically dependent on any sort of infrastructure any more than calculus is. Sure, internet makes communication of information easier, but no where does it say that blocks need to come in over the internet, or that nodes need to communicate transactions over the internet. As long as we have some sort of communication protocol, bitcoin will work.

In theory you could query all UTXOs for anything with a check time verify operator in it... can't remember the two operator types off the top of my head, but I quoted a copy of Mastering Bitcoin just above/below this comment that has them. 
After doing that, you would just write a script to do the math to figure it out. Very few people actually time lock, a lot talk about it. 
Also, this completely neglects P2SH UTXOs where the script is presented at time of spending, and there's no way to decipher that. I would imagine most people who have the knowledge to use a time lock also have it in a script hash.

Even with zero regular use, there's still a value to a fixed supply, relatively scarce, digital "asset", that you probably own/control, and can be transferred relatively easily, and no one can tell you that you can't send it. 
Think of it as Gold 2.0, and even purely as an inflation hedge, the price is extremely low compared to other inflation hedge assets. The rapid price rises and volatility you are seeing are the combined market forces of greed, fear, and overall enlightenment of the underlying potential of the system, and you are watching it rise to its market price from 0. And when compared to other inflation hedge assets, the price with the same valuation would be in the hundreds of thousands. 
There's also currently rapid development in this space, looking to fix all the properties of money that bitcoin is not very good at, and then some. So with this added liquidity and fungibility in the future it could grab even more potential market space as a replacement for actual currency. In its current form it (nor other crypto currencies) make for very good replacements for a myriad of reasons.
Tl;dr, the potential markets that this protocol can directly compete with, and will be able to compete with in the future, gives us a glimpse at possible overall valuations, and in an effort to buy it cheap, people are buying it up rapidly until it approaches such valuations people are internalizing. When it reaches said valuations, its likely to simply correct up and down until it reaches an equilibrium that is very stable as it can't be diluted by credit, and people will then spend it on everyday items. But you don't buy gold at $10/oz and look where you can spend it for $15/oz

Ok, well difference of opinion I guess. I believe permissionless access to a node is what gives bitcoin its actual value. Ecash isn't interesting, we already have Venmo, squarecash, and wechat that work much better and easier, but have permissioned access. 


Tell me, what do you do when nodes cost $10k to run? Do you run a node? If you are a small business, do your run a node? Or you could pay $5/month to google for "bitcoin service", and buy 166 years worth of node access for the same amount, not to mention the savings on the gigabit internet service you will need. And so when it's only Google and Amazon and Microsoft et all running nodes for subsription service, what's to stop them from upping the blocks to 1TB blocks? Think of the volume... they can handle that. You can't. Smaller server farms can't. Further centralization. And how do you vote against that if you don't have a node.
And what happens in that scenario? Govt wants to cut you out of finance. Guess who gets put on a blacklist and can't get node access from anywhere... good luck sending a transaction, which requires broadcasting to other nodes. It's the definition of permissioned access. User nodes validate consensus rules and thus choose what bitcoin is. Miners present blocks, that's it. Miners are just special user nodes. It's the usernodes (including the miners) that protect the network, because they protect their own interests with their own consensus rules, and their network state matches others, so there's value. Byzantine General's problem. 


"Virtual mempools"? What are you talking about. L2 is literally just locking funds in a multisignature wallet and saying we will come back later and tell everyone how we want to split these funds. 


No central banking is fractional reserve lending and creating money out of thin air. That is not possible with L2. In fact, it is possible and does happen with traditional bitcoin, in the form of Mt Gox, and any other custodial service. 
You clearly have a very warped idea of how L2 works, and a fundamental understanding of how bitcoin works in general if you believe you can grow it to any worldwide level, on chain, and not end up with a permissioned access, pay for access system.

Not sure what you are asking about "downspend", but basically, you both lock an equal amount of funds into an escrow address on the blockchain. That address requires as part of its scripthash (its code), a closing transaction that tells where to send the funds and how much to each party, and a signature from each party. 
Then, you just keep playing back and forth transactions with someone until you are done playing. With each new off chain transaction, you both create the properly formatted transaction, and both sign it. It's like filling out a check with two payees and two signatures. If no one turns this check in, nothing happens. You can keep writing new checks, destroying the old one (in this case, it would have a later time stamp so it is provably newer) and both parties have a copy that they can post at any time. 
No one can write a new closing transaction amount because they don't have your signature. So just like no one can pull cash out of your wallet, no one can rob your escrow. 
There's a further caveat. If you go to post the final transaction with only one of the signatures, and the other party doesn't respond (maybe they died, who knows/cares), there's a block/time limit where if they don't respond, you get all of the money.
So on a scale of larger than 2 people, you simply interact with a hub person connected between both of you. Or a hub between a hub between you two. It doesn't really matter. You can communicate outside the payment channel, a PKI handshake just like when you initiate an SSL connection, where you can prove that the center party either sent it or didn't. It's possible to implement that secret, into the finalizing transaction, where it only goes through if the secret is fully obtained. If they don't pay who they said they were going to pay, the encumbrance isn't met, and the closing transaction isn't valid. At that point, you simply close the channel and get all your money back, or they don't respond and you get 2X your money.

Machines learn to do things that they are set to do. I've been delving into the topic quite deeply lately, and effectively you set their goal task, and they find the most efficient pattern to that. They don't go beyond that. 
The problem with that is, if your goal is to irradiate a certain type of race and mine isn't, then what do we set the goal to be. There's obvious things like eliminating murder that we can probably agree upon, but other things like levels of taxation aren't exactly as evenly decided upon. 
And I disagree that there's no such thing as a free market. Free markets are effectively just like machine learning in that they aggregate all available knowledge and the outcome is portrayed. Sure there's small scale manipulation, but Microsoft isn't going bankrupt because of some arbitration/speculation on its short term stock price. I don't think, if your goal is to eliminate murder, that you can on a large scale manipulate the numbers enough to sway anything. Either the selected solution is helping or it isn't helping. 
I see a future prediction market driven society, where goals of society are democratically voted on, and then prediction markets choose the best "subcontracted" solutions to those goals. Objectively driven legislation rather than feel good bullshit. If the objective is to decrease poverty levels, then a solution, whether it is presented with AI or not, is either objectively good or not good at meeting those goals, and a well developed prediction market would be able to award those most knowledgeable on the topic. For example, average Joe really should have no real say in nuclear energy regulations. However, if somehow Joe can accumulate enough knowledge that his proposed solution objectively progresses towards decided upon outcomes, then who is to say he shouldn't have a say. Likewise, you can have a PhD in nuclear sciences, but if all your solutions suck, who cares. The market would reward those who offer the best solution, and punish those who make the wrong decisions. It doesn't matter if Joe is a machine, a 12 year old, or a nuclear scientist. The only thing that matters is if his solution is good at implementing the goals, and it is selected upon by a prediction market of other qualified individuals (qualified by their market performance, not fancy pieces of paper). 
Obviously we are many decades away from such an intricate structure to be able to guide such decisions. It would most likely have many derivative structures on it because we are not only measuring Joes objective performance, but also, using that to dictate winners and losers in the market that chose him, across many different other alternatives. 
DAOs right now are equivalent to DOS in terms of capabilities, and such a scenario has the complexity of a cutting edge operating system. We have a lot of work to go.

Correct, a ***correctly implemented*** paper wallet has less attack vectors and is "safer" (marginally). But most people generate a paper wallet on internet attached devices and such, which is probably worse. 
A hardware wallet is effectively a paper wallet that can be used more often than a paper wallet. And you can be assured that the key never touches an internet connected device. 
For the vast majority of people, a hardware wallet is the safest option, because part of a security scheme requires being able to securely access it.
Unless you are generating a wallet with a coin and a pencil, flipping that coin 256 times, paper wallet generators are a risk for the general public.

I don't disagree with you, but bitcoin isn't a new system. It's simply a real token of value for the current system, a system where the government has worked very very hard to ensure we don't have such a token. The current system is designed to force you to either invest into overvalued stocks, or partake in consumer spending, or let your value evaporate with time. Bitcoin offers a lifeboat in that system. A place to actually park value that can't be evaporated away. But it's not a new system by any means.

People mistake hardware wallets for what they really are. They are really just effectively a way to use a paper wallet, without actually exposing your keys. 
When you setup a hardware wallet, step 1 you get a seed that you have to write down. *This is your paper wallet*. The only thing a hardware wallet does, is allow you to use funds attached to that paper wallet, without that seed ever seeing the light of day ever again. In bitcoin, everything is done in transactions. So you point to previous transactions that are locked to you, bundle them up into a new transaction locked to a new address, and sign that transaction solving the encumbrance of each previous transaction you reference. A hardware wallet basically works, by having your computer put together a transaction (think filling out a check), and then over USB it sends the unsigned transaction. The hardware wallet then signs it, never exposing your private keys to the computer (think physically signing a check). Then, it sends back over USB a signed transaction. Then, the wallet software simply broadcasts that signed transaction to be picked up in a block. Just like a physical check, if it isn't valid or not actually turned in, the funds never move and nothing happens. And the device is designed to have this very limited capability over USB. Theorhetically it should be impossible to get the keys over USB, because there's not even a method created to allow it. I say theorhetically, because you can never be 100%. Instead it's like 99.9999999999999...%
Hardware wallets are theorhetically less secure than a ***properly created*** paper wallet. However, most people don't properly create a paper wallet and the potential to be exposed is much higher than setting up your hardware wallet, which has proper techniques built in, and the seed is displayed on the device, never touching the computer. But, assuming both are implemented correctly, you have all the same risks of a paper wallet (minus physical destruction I guess if your hardware is relatively resilient) but the slightly increased security holes that could be lurking in a hardware device. I would say these increased risks are absolutely minimal at most, and the benefits of enforcing of correctly setting up the seed phrase far outweighs them for the general public. Especially if 99% of the device's life is spent unplugged.

If demand is how you define a speculative bubble, then I have some bad news for you about every single world currency, and every inflation hedging asset like gold. The reason that piece of paper with a number on it, or better yet, that piece of plastic that links you to a database with numbers in it is worth anything, is the very fundamental concept that it is valuable because people believe it is valuable. Bitcoin is no different except for instead of having to use Visa or Wells Fargo to facilitate such transactions, we use a decentralized ledger that everyone has, and can individually verify the transaction. But to pretend like that piece of paper/money in your bank account have any value behind the trust that you can walk into a grocery store and buy chicken with it later, is foolish. ALL money is based off the idea that you can communicate the transfer of value, and that the recipient can later redeem that value for something else.


Is bitcoin overbought and overhyped at the moment? Possibly. Possibly not. I for one believe there is at least *some* inherent value in something that we collectively decide there to be a finite amount of, with predictable supply, that is fairly easily transferable, and I can expect with relative certainty it will still be worth something tomorrow. After all, that's why fiat works. And bitcoin has been doing that pretty well for about 8 years now, so there's no real alarm to me that it will be worth nothing tomorrow. Significantly less? Sure. But I also know that the supply is controlled and there's no guarantee the dollar won't be worth significantly less in the near future either. After all, it has lost 97% of its buying power in just over 100 years. And when you compare it's features to other inflation hedge assets, its possible valuation is ridiculously cheap, so its entirely possible that it is simply reaching its fair market value from 0, one that if we consider it in relation to gold, would be upwards of hundreds of thousands, so its not exactly unreasonable to see it only get to &lt;7% of that over a decade. A Bently goes from being worth $0 to hundreds of thousands of dollars over a very short period of time as well, but no one complains about that.


You seem to mistake the end goal here. It is not to transfer back into fiat. It is to replace fiat. I have no intentions on selling for fiat. I intend on buying a big mac for 5000 satoshis once the price has reached it's fair market value. If it drops off sharply because it was overvalued and overbought as per the market's demand for it, sure I may sell some off, but only so that I can buy more at the bottom. This is how markets work. You buy things that are undervalued, and sell things that are overvalued.


So because people were wrong about it to begin with, it now has absolutely no value? Sure. Go ahead and tell that to the inventor of the microwave oven. And there is no "artificial scarcity". It is absolutely scarce. In the same way that 2+2 is absolutely 4.


Again, if this is how you define something being worthless, I have some very, very bad news for you. Hackers want to steal it because they know with reasonably high certainty that they can then redeem that for other things of value. Just like how when you work for fiat, you know, with reasonably high certainty, that you can redeem that fiat for other things of value. If the dollar became worth half as much tomorrow, would you not want double your salary?


You seem to fundamentally misunderstand what gives bitcoin value. Bitcoin has value because you cannot send me bitcoin without first acquiring bitcoin. Period. End of story. So you cannot, logically tell me, that if I am selling my car for bitcoin, and only bitcoin, that it has no value. Because *I* am giving it value. There's at least a discrete amount of demand for bitcoin, in exchange for something that we both agree also has value. You can disagree, but the only way you are going to get my car is by giving me bitcoin for it. And the only way that you can do that is to first acquire bitcoin. And the only way that you can do that is by either begging for it, providing goods/services for it, or exchanging something else of value for it.
Right now, I think you would have a very tough time explaining to a Venezuelan that their fiat currency, a demand based currency just like the rest of them, has more value than bitcoin does. You can again, disagree with me, but the markets disagree with you.

You could make a check that says to only autosign if transaction depends on some secret and a balancing transaction on another channel. Any explicit transactions starting from the hub could be required to have an entirely separate signature not on the machine.
But payments within channels can only go back and forth between channels. If I'm a hop, I'm sending an equal amount that I'm receiving, and locking it with the same conditions that I need in order to unlock what comes to me. If they cash out my tx, then I simply cash out the incoming tx that triggered a hop.

Falling into the mental trap that bitcoin is a scam without even looking into what it is (which if that was the case, I doubt you would still believe it was a scam), just because some 16 year old is foolish and made some money on speculation is the equivalent of marking Microsoft as a scam in 2001 because it was part of the dot com bubble.

Must have missed the opportunity to apply for the "women in engineering" scholarship with my penis. Funny thing about engineering/math, doesn't matter what genitalia you have, you're either right or you are wrong. How is the offering of free education "societal discouragement"? What's your definition of "societal encouragement"? Is it denying me because I'm a white male? 


No, sorry, I do real work. 


Bullshit, I roomed with a "diversity" kid who got a 2.3 in a school where a white male got a 4.2 in high school and was denied... explain that. 


Yes, we had large classes and that's my point. It was *encouraged* to have women through literally economic incentives, but *they still didn't*. That's somehow my fault though. 


Maybe women and men just have different hobbies/interests?


Or, idk, men and women are different. Still doesn't mean elementary education is equal rigor of STEM... basic supply and demand. When there's a lot of available teachers (because it's easier to get a degree), why would you pay more? Clearly never took an economics class.

I generally follow the "slowest in the herd" security strategy. I don't need to be the fastest gazelle, just faster than the slowest gazelle. 
In terms of bitcoin, just like every other end user product what most people use will be a neutered version, tracked entirely by end to end exchanges. In fact, I see it being no different than the current system, where banks simply have fractional reserves of it and offer "free" transfers within their own regulated ecosystem... and don't underestimate the general public's willingness to sell their privacy/protection in exchange for not paying a penny per fee. 
But in terms of the ability to "regulate" and "control" bitcoin? Very doubtful. More likely, it will end up like the regulation of spam email. Sure there's laws against it, but what are the penalties? Just don't be the slowest gazelle. I'm not sending nuclear codes over email, so my security bounty is far below the required threshold it would take to put active effort into hacking PGP emails on small private email server... which stores files in encrypted format. 
All I'm saying is that I think we are entering a new era where money transmittance becomes like file transferring and emails in terms of legislative enforceability. They can legislate it to death, but it simply doesn't care because the threshold to become very very secure is too low, too many people will be doing it. It's a lot easier to regulate money when everything runs through less than 100 institutions. When anyone can start an institution on minimal hardware... good luck.

Nothing about Bcash is superior at all. They chose the worst possible option for scaling, and I wish them the best from it, but there's a reason no respectable developer wastes their time with it. 
They don't even have transaction malleability fixed. It is literally a coin for miners by miners and will be carried out as long as there's a fool willing to buy what they mine. Once some of the real development being done in bitcoin comes to a head bcash is done for.

This is the problem with having people interact with the protocol layer directly. That's not to be offensive, it's just reality. Blockspace is a limited resource, and the fairest way to allocate a limited resource is a market, however that doesn't mean it's going to be easy, which is why we should aim for most users to delegate that task to a transaction aggregator. As long as there is low barriers to entry (anyone can permissionlessly access it) it keeps aggregator services honest. If one is cheating/charging to much, it should be easy to start your own and take their profit. 
The chart is a visual representation of transactions in the mempool, classified by fee range. Each layer is a different fee range. When the overall height is large, there's a large transaction backup. When it is small, most transactions are fitting into a block regardless of fee. 
Miners make blocks on a "greedy" algorithm, meaning they simply fill the space with the most expensive txs first but they also will fill as much as they can. So the chart is basically saying, that pretty much all transactions of reasonable fees are getting in. Your wallet software is asking a computer what the fee range is, and then picking a fee from there. But most of the time this just balloons upwards, and in reality, you can still fit in a block with a minuscule fee. Many people get through in reasonable time with 5-10 sat/byte, but no wallet software is going to do that because users expect instant and the wallet designer gets bitched at. 
The problem isn't bitcoin or a blocksize, the problem is an end user base that s used to free/instant visa transactions now extrapolating those expectations to a distributed ledger where tx space is a limited resource and market participation is a requirement.

Just because something was intended to do something doesn't neglect technical realities. 
The technical realities are that if block sizes increase, centralization increases as well due to feasibility of running central nodes. The core purpose/value of bitcoin is a secure store/transfer of value in an entirely trustless system. It can do that now, and can continue to do that forever. You can even do it peer to peer. There's nothing stopping you.
But the objective reality is that in order to use such a system, *and* for it to remain decentralized, the blocks have to remain a manageable size, and right now, even a small increase in block size would affect the feasibility of a large number of nodes. That's an indisputable fact. The debate is not about that happening, but whether that is acceptable. Space on the blockchain is a scarce resource due to those technical limitations. And as with anything else that is scarce and has use, that value has a market price. So if you want to use it for peer to peer transfers, you are completely free to do so, but understand that there is a cost that accompanies it, driven by economic realities. 
Bitcoin is not a charity.

And that's a bad thing? If that is the only thing that is "starting over"?
And you don't think a POWC would make someone weary of building an ASIC and trying to strongarm the system knowing the group as a whole already POWC'd once?
And to finished of this logical pinning, would it be considered "starting over" if bitcoin was designed with a daily, random, POW from the beginning? Or would that not just be considered part of the overall design, and people compensate by not building ASICs?
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:10:48
You keep saying "tear it down and start again"... Please define what you mean by that. Do you really think that if we change the POW, it is effectively going back to 2008? Where there's all of like 30 people who have heard of it, no exchanges, nothing like "Wallet Words" or any of the other innovations that surround bitcoin.
That's where you are getting hung up. There *is no starting over*. WHAT is starting over? The only thing starting over is the miners losing their advantage. The consumers lose nothing but hash power. And it's entirely ok for a consumer to prefer low hash power and decentralization over centralization. Decentralization is a feature of bitcoin. Just because we temporarily said that we would prefer some centralization (ASICs) to occur, doesn't mean that we can't just turn around and say that we don't like the outcome of it, and then just change our preferences again. Bitcoin and the market for a decentralized currency is still there. Nothing has disappeared except for the centralization aspect of ASICs. And it isn't impossible for the POW to randomly change daily, and the users can still buy and sell bitcoins, on the exchanges that still exist, and everything remains the same except bitcoin remains decentralized because it is impossible (or not cost effective) to guess the POW algorithm in a manner that allows centralization.
If POW changed tomorrow, I would still have all of my bitcoin, and I could still spend them all the same.

Cash implies *no* fees, which was never going to be possible for bitcoin past the second halvening. 
And a whitepaper is only good for the context it is written in, which in this case, is pre-bitcoin. As things change, whitepapers should be revised to match. A whitepaper is not some religious document, it is a technical document explaining the thought process. 
The thought process now is that on chain bitcoin will *always have fees*, *always be 100% traceable*, and *always take at least 10 minutes to confidently transact*, which makes it a terrible replacement for cash and now options like venmo. The reality of the situation is that bitcoin makes a much better ACH/wire system with permission less access, and should be developed as such, regardless the original intent.

Who cares who Satoshi is? He had a great idea, that sparked the actions of a bunch of equally/more intelligent people who got us to where we are today. It has been a group effort of a bunch of people who are experts in different areas that relate. 
If the real Satoshi wants to come out, it's quite easy for him to do so unequivocally... send a transaction to another bitcoin account, from his genesis account, with a message revealing his identity. You would think someone who is a cryptography genius could understand the basics of digital signatures. 
The fact that he hasn't done so yet tells me he doesn't want to be known, and anyone who claims to be Satoshi is an imposter.
If Satoshi was to prove his identity, then sure, I would trust his intuition as well. But there's plenty of people who come up with great ideas and don't understand other aspects of those ideas. Bitcoin is as much /more about economics, finance and game theory, than it is about programming and cryptography. There's plenty of programmers in this space that don't understand the economics of it fully.

But that doesn't really do much if the hash power currently *is* consolidated and a 51% attack *is* immediately viable. 
The security of bitcoin is in the encryption. Bitcoin was technologically feasible with CPU mining and GPU mining long before FPGAs and ASICs entered the picture.

Currency and power aren't tied to each other. Power costs are directly related to the cost of fuel/operation costs of maintaining the generation plants/distribution infrastructure. There's some subsidizing in there too, so that normal users don't get railed price wise, but electricity really has nothing to do with the USD. 
If bitcoin became the primary currency, it would just mean this fuel/labor/materials would be paid for using bitcoin. It doesn't change the market cost of the fuel/labor/materials, and electricity would simply cost about what it does today, but in whatever that value would be in bitcoin in the future.

@_date: 2017-04-26 12:42:40
I disagree. This isn't 2013 where you have literally just copies of bitcoin with small tweaks, enticing the attention of the public as the "next bitcoin". At least now, any new coin that comes out is making an effort to have its own identity. Ethereum is operating in the realm of smart contracts exclusively. Dash/monero are experimenting with privacy centric ways of transferring value, Golem is in the realm of resource sharing, factom is focused on document verification, etc etc. 
Are there plenty of projects that are overlapping each other and will probably fail? Sure. But to pretend like there isn't innovation and value being created in the realm of alt coins is burying your head in the sand and it's a good way to miss out on a lot of money. Anywhere you have smart people concentrating their efforts, value is inevitably created. 
Bitcoin has solidified itself as a store and transfer of value in the most secure fashion on the planet. But there's plenty of other use cases that blockchains can provide, that bitcoin isn't providing right now. And if the current situation is any telling, things are going to move slowly in terms of changing bitcoin, which frankly I'm ok with. But I also recognize that means bitcoin probably won't be the Swiss Army knife of blockchains, which I'm also ok with. The future very likely consists of many different coins/assets that do many different things, and you can fluidly move value between them all in ways that best benefit you.

They don't require it, but it sure as hell makes it easier to implement. I enjoy programming in Python because assembly language is complicated, and I really don't need it.


I disagree. I think we see decision based technologies form, and those become bedrock layers for the next layer, rinse and repeat. SSH really hasn't changed much in years, but it was revolutionary a couple decades ago, and is till used today.


Its still better than what Bitcoin is providing as an alternative. Execution of many algorithms are currently impossible because of the lack of energy in the universe, however it doesn't mean we consider all computer programming languages non Turing Complete because they have a practical energy consumption limit. Turing Complete uses the assumption that "given" all the resources in the world, does the language have the ability to complete the algorithm. Does ethereum not have that ability?




You implied that somehow Bitcoin being more secure than any other alt coin makes the other features I mentioned come true. In fact, up until this point, Bitcoins security and name recognition are the *only* things that allow it to perform it's primary function that is the store of value. I don't think that will ever go away.

I don't know the details. But I trust Andreas Antonopoulos very much in this space, and his last LTB podcast made it sound like it was still highly debatable, although the motive alignments are mostly the smoking gun.
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:00:27
Yes, almost exactly. When someone sends you money, they are saying "take $5 from my account, referencing these transactions to me, and then apply them to your account. They may only be spent using the private key for the account referenced." You then have that private key, and can make the same statement to others. 
Sometimes, you may have $5 but only want to spend $1. So what actually happens is you actually make two of those "documents". The transaction references the $5 in, but your output includes $1 to your payee, and $4 back to yourself. So you are actually saying "pay myself $4 out of my $5, and only my private key can spend them". Now you can't reference the $5 again, because that was already used in a transaction. 
In terms of how far back do you have to check? Miners create blocks of transactions, and a little bit more data, and then that block has a hash of the data. In order to validate a transaction, it simply checks that the input hasn't been referenced in any previous blocks since it was born (created from a previous spend). Because this block also includes the hash of the previous block, which includes the hash of the previous block, it can be assumed that it is accurate. Once a miner finds a block that works, they publish that block to the network. The nodes all check if the block is legit or not. If it is, they then work off that one. If it isn't, they reject that block and wait for one that is legit. They can easily calculate this by simply hashing the block with the found nonce. If you are sending some bitcoin back and forth with some friends, you are still all publishing your previous spends to the blockchain, and everyone is still aware of them. So if you decide to break that circle and send it elsewhere, you would simply reference the last time it was sent to you. 
When you send the transaction, you actually don't send it for the exact amount. Instead of paying yourself back $4, you may send back $3.50, so $1 spent, $3.50 change, and $.50 left unspent. The miner who mines the block adds finds all these differences, adds them up, and references them all to his address, along with the block reward, thus paying himself. Because he gets to pick the transactions he includes in his block, he will likely go after the higher fee ones first. You can spend a bitcoin transaction with no fee, just don't expect any miners to include it in their block. 
The alternate proposal for scaling is BU, which would effectively allow for miners to choose a size from "unlimited" to pick as the current block size. This sounds great, but remember, bitcoin is a trustless ecosystem and you have to trust that they are going to work in their own best interest. If BU was to be implemented, miners could control the price of blockchain space like OPEC rules the price of oil. The reason gas was like $4/5 a gallon a few years back, was because OPEC just throttled back production, but demand was still there. Then the US started refining oil sands and created oil for the market that OPEC wasn't planning for, so the price dropped (supply increased). Then they started increasing oil production so they could survive, which tanked the price and now we have cheap gas again. Effectively, a few Chinese miners could choose the price of a bitcoin transaction by choosing how many they decide to let through. The only way to beat them would be to invest millions of dollars into a mining operation. Oh yeah, they also control the ASIC manufacturing. 
Also, there's extreme evidence to support that Antpool, the worlds largest miner in China, is using a proprietary hash algorithmic called ASICBOOST that basically gives them an advantage. It's only in their chips (they are basically the only one producing miners) and it only activates if you use their pool. It's said to be a 20% increase in efficiency. Wouldn't you like a 20% handicap at winning the lottery? It equates to about $100M advantage every year. Segwit inadvertently fixes the possibility to use ASICBOOST. 
And if all of that isn't enough, it was recently discovered that all Bitmain (antpool's manufacturer... they are the same) miners have a "feature/bug" depending what side you are on, that can allow for bitmain to send a remote command and shut down your miner until you start it back up. Basically, they could kill 80% of the worlds mining power at will. (It has since been discovered and people have implemented fixes). 
Meanwhile, there's a guy named Roger Ver who is using his massive bitcoin fortune to cause a bunch of drama which moves money from bitcoin into altcoins. It's pretty easy to believe he has since spread a lot of bitcoin into altcoins, and the more drama in bitcoin, the more he makes in altcoins. 
Top it all off with the fact that BU has been hacked multiple times killing half the nodes, they have proposed increasing the hard limit of $21M coins, and they continually have bugs that still haven't been fixed, and it's hard not to see the resistance to Segwit as a half backed scam to protect your $100M/yr advantage.

Does Bitcoin include the Turing complete programming language to support these natively? If so, why would so many people be waiting on Rootstock for Bitcoin?


I never said bitcoin was worthless. Bitcoin has dominance in the store and ultra secure transfer of value space. When world economies collapse, people don't/won't flock to ethereum, dash, etc. They will flock to bitcoin. But if I want to send money privately (more privately than bitcoin can currently provide), quickly, and cheaply, while giving up some of that security, alt coins happen to be a great option for that. It's not binary.

I disagree with the "worthless atlcoins" sentiment.
This is hardly 2013, where everyone was just creating bitcoin with a new name, and jumping onto anything that was rising quickly (litecoin, dogecoin, peer coin, etc.). Basically every alt coin in the space now operates on a set, focused goal, that is different from bitcoin's proven role as a secure store/transfer of value.
Dash/Monero/Zcash all operate in the realm of more privacy centric payments, Ethereum is for smart contracts, Golem is for cloud computing, Steem is for a social network platform, Factom is for document verification... Hardly anyone is trying to do exactly what bitcoin is trying to do. The people who think ether will overtake bitcoin as a payment method are delusional, and overvaluing it. But to pretend that ether only has a price in the 70s because of speculation is burying your head in the sand. Whenever you have smart people all concentrating their efforts, you also have value being created.
Even litecoin is serving a separate purpose of somewhat of a beta for bitcoin technologies.

They are saying if you get caught up on the price, or some very possible future cliff amount, you'll get sick worrying or just lose your money. 
Buy into bitcoin expecting it to drop 50% immediately after you bought it, but hoping it will be at +200% in a year or so. If you do see it dropping sharply, and it's not because SHA256 was broken, it may be a good time to buy more if you are wanting to, because it may very well never be that low again.

At this point, I feel it would be better to just give them the illusion of control, and potentially the control over the segments the common folk will frequently use.

Sure I would use a decentralized currency, but bitcoin has some crucial points that make it a very bad candidate for that. There's a reason fiat used to be *backed* by a store of value asset like gold/silver, and it's because currency facilitates a different purpose than just a store of value. 
Currency facilitates trade. It allows for me to transfer to you, a credit of value that I was transferred because of something I did that created value. It is lubrication for economic activities. It can store value, but because its primary purpose is to facilitate trade, it is in the best interest of the currency to be inflationary. Otherwise, it would make no sense to trade that currency for anything other than absolute necessities. Why buy a new TV when the value of that currency will increase over time. On the other hand, if the value goes down over time, it's more worth it for me to spend it now before it's worth less tomorrow. Me spending it, allows for the people who were involved in getting that to feed their families, buy other things to rinse and repeat. This is the entire theory of monetary policy. 
The problem, is when there are no good, liquid options to store your value. Obviously savings are a good thing, and we want assets that not decrease in value just to keep economic activity going. Right now the only things for long term savings are the sock market (hello risk and fraud), cash (inflationary over time), or gold (highly illiquid). That's where bitcoin comes in. It has a fixed limit (deflationary), but it is also relatively liquid with it getting more liquid every day.
A realistic future is one where people can store value with relatively low risk, but quickly change that stored value to spendable value. You only really hold the spendable value if you are spending in the near future. It offers features that are favorable to a currency (inflationary at a controlled rate, privacy centric, quick transactions, etc, etc) but you are willing to risk some more centralization in exchange for those features. It doesn't necessarily matter for long term viability of the platform if there is an option for a highly decentralized, ultra secure store of your value, because you wouldn't be storing your value in the currency, but rather the asset. The currencies will come and go just like Venmo, PayPal, visa, MasterCard, etc come and go, all offering different features, but they will all be backed by a secure asset of bitcoin, and all their transactions are verified on the blockchain. Because they all use bitcoin on their bedrock layer, the demand for bitcoin constantly increases, and it constantly maintains/rises in value. 
So tl;dr, yes a (mostly) decentralized currency would be nice. But bitcoin isn't going to be it, but rather it will be the underlying asset that all the competing "currencies" depend on. And you simply use the ones that make sense for the transaction you are making, and pay the respective fee. The operators of that currency cash in on the difference between their fee collection and the fee to change that value on the blockchain.

Other blockchains also have a fraction of the usage, a fraction of the hashing power, and most aren't even used as payment channels, but are primarily built for an alternative purpose, so extrapolating payments to their chain is pointless. As Andreas Antonopoulos says "you can't have scaling problems without scale". Rest assured if another alt became the primary payment method, they too would be having issues. 
And to address your LN concerns, frankly they're false. LN has been tested extensively on the test net, and every day without Segwit is another day it proves itself in testing. But let's pretend your concerns were founded in truth, would you be willing to change your position after it proves itself usable on litecoin?

If other less drastic measures can be taken, I'd prefer those obviously because there is a marginal utility of a high hash rate (when teamed with an equally important logical solution from a CPU (POWA), it redecentralizes without losing the hashing power). 
But if that's the only thing that can happen to ensure decentralization, then no I don't see a problem with that. Because my consumer preferences value decentralization over an arbitrarily high hash rate. 
Why would you want a centralized, high hash rate?
@_date: 2017-04-01 16:47:54
You are so wrong. Bitcoin doesn't start over if POW is changed. Maybe miners do, but the market doesn't. Every BIP stays in place, all research, all the lessons learned... Did the movie industry "start over" when Netflix was born? No, it just adjusted its supply methods. Consumer preferences matter. [That's a fundamental building block of economics.]( If you don't understand that the entire draw to bitcoin is the decentralized nature that was there before we allowed ASICs, there's nothing more to talk about. Consumers can literally prefer anything. Just because you may not think it's cost viable (that's a different argument), or there is a big enough market to have a substantial price, *does not mean that it cannot exist*. You are fundamentally missing the point. Once again, see "little guy mangos". See any local coffee shop vs starbucks. There's plenty of examples in the real world of markets designed with the sole purpose of satisfying the consumer preference of non centralized structures. People like *YOU* are the reason this country has allowed monopolies to exist is because you're "regulations" do nothing but stifle competition.
And Bittorrent is an awful example. Bittorent relys entirely on the voluntary transaction and giving up of resources. BitTorrent is more like a charity than any economic structure. Economic structures exist for the allocation of resources. BitTorrent, what you are gaining out of participating is the copying (or quite literally creation from nothing) of something, because of a stranger's willingness to offer up bandwidth resources to you. You can't just create economic resources out of thin air like you can a file. Someone needs to put in effort to purify water, provide healthcare, etc. etc.

There's a very large backing to bitcoin that supports *literally* wealth based currency. All major currencies in the world today are just government issued paper, with no actual backing. There was a time that a "pound" represented a "pound" of gold, or a dollar represented a defined amount of gold/silver, just as a unit of length is defined by something physical. Now governments can simply print off money at will, and your dollar loses its value little by little with each new dollar printed.
Just 5 years ago, a coke was $1 at a vending machine. Now it's $1.75. Just 5 years ago, most people had never heard of bitcoin and it was less than $1 per coin. Today a bitcoin is worth ~$250. When it gets in the news or if something big (like a government economy collapsing *cough Greece cough*) happens people see bitcoin for what it is and it starts to rise in value. The money hungry traders get involved and it starts to move in value like crazy. Next thing you know it fluctuates up and down and up and down and you can lose your shirt. But then again people lose their shirt with Forex all the time too...
Looking at the time span vs value of bitcoin, the *increase* in valve is astronomical. When it wasn't being speculated on like a stock this past year (it wasn't in the news near as much) it has held ~$250 pretty steadily. Enough that you can reliably use it as a currency.
This is still very early stages. Just like computers, you will have people who have no use for a machine that can calculate numbers and specializes in spreadsheet math. People who have them either do so for a specific purpose or are just straight up geeks. Its hard to explain. But people will continue to develop onto of bitcoin and give it more and more utility, and because there is a finite amount of them, they will continue to rise in value in the long term, net sense. Try to day trade with them, you deserve to lose all the money you lose.
Keep in mind that the reason you can go to Facebook/reddit, post digital pictures, listen to digital music, etc. is all based on a tiny little chip pumping out calculations. Just because something isn't immediately identifiable as valuable doesn't mean it isn't. There's a reason there are some extremely intelligent people so excited about this technology.
I have a small "spending" wallet that I enjoy the geeky novelty of spending bitcoin with, and a long term "savings" wallet that I will let ride to hopefully increase in value. In the end, looking at the two rates between bitcoin and the dollar, bitcoin has a MUCH better return over a long enough period of time. That's just my thoughts though, its your money feel free to do with it as you please.

The subprime crisis was more based on the idea that people were insuring the loss of these loans, and they were over crediting them to make them look better, so the insurance would cost less.
AIG owned most of these insurance policies. AIG was also one of the most secure institutions in the world at the time, and it quite literally was "too big to fail". That's not to say that the free market shouldn't have let it fail, but more that basically everyone would have felt it across the world. Pension funds, mutual funds, other banks, all owned AIG securities. It would have literally created a financial meltdown. 
Unless some equally large insurance agency has insured a bunch of loans with fraudulent credit ratings, we won't see anything anywhere close to the 2008 scandal. 
What made 2008 so bad was the cascading affect of collapsing debts across industries and even countries.

* Dash/Monero/Zcash - Look at any current deep net market. Sure that's a nefarious use case, but still a use case given value by it's privacy centric properties... People may want privacy centric properties for other non nefarious purposes as well, especially in the future.
* Ethereum - [Dapps...]( Like I said, when you have intelligent people concentrating their efforts, value is created. Out of the 398 today, maybe only one hits it big, maybe the one that will hit it big hasn't yet been created, but to think that things aren't being done with ether is again, putting your head in the sand.
* Golem - I don't personally know of anyone actually using this platform, but given the popularity of cloud computing, and its enterprise potentials, I don't see any reason why if it technically works it wouldn't be used at least in some regard.
* Steem - [Yes, people are publishing articles on steem](
* Factom - This company just finished it's series A funding, but has grants from the Bill Gates Foundation to secure health records for Africans in the blockchain, and has a contract with the DoHS of the USA to help secure the IoT. They are creating software that is easy enough for your average corporate drone to use, but is actually using benefits of the blockchain.
* Litecoin - Currently, many Chinese exchanges have only Bitcoin and Litecoin. Litecoin is the exact same code as Bitcoin, and so [Segwit being activated on it]( allows for people to experiment with Segwit/LN and see how they like it without Bitcoin implementing it onto a $20B cryptocurrency.
Yes. Contrary to your head in the sand mindset, people are actually using alt coins for things other than speculative trading.

Being that bitcoin is deflationary, it actually makes for a pretty terrible currency, and a really great store of value. I think it is a mistake to continue to tout bitcoin as a currency, when it really is a store of value. The easiest way to explain to newcomers is that it is a currency, because we really don't have a very good analogy currently for someone to visualize the concept. In reality, it is closer to an infinitely divisible gold than it is fiat currency.

Well I'm not hardware security expert, but the only thing required to spend your bitcoin is the associated private key with the address the bitcoin is stored in.
That seed that it generated when you first started it, was generated using a random number generator. If you look into random number generation with computer science, you will find it's actually more complex than just asking the computer to spit out a number. It needs a source of "entropy" which is a measure of "disorder" or "randomness", otherwise you could theoretically predict the output of the random number generator.
Just because KK is offline/wiped, doesn't mean you can't spend the bitcoin. The bitcoin isn't *on* the keepkey, just your public address, and your private key are. Think of bitcoin like a scoreboard type system. The bitcoin are "in the cloud" on the main ledger, and when you want to spend it, you essentially reference an address with a sufficient amount, and the private key to be able to prove you own them. If I was able to figure out the random numbers used to generate your seed, I could then generate your key, and with that key, I could spend your bitcoin without your KK ever having to come online.
The reality is, unless you want to become a security expert, you will always have *some* level of risk, and even if you know everything about security, it's still very hard to protect against all risks. By using a hardware wallet, you are one step ahead of the next guy, which in security, is always a good strategy. I don't have to have a bank vault for a door, my door just has to be stronger than my neighbor's door.
In terms of minimizing this risk, you could buy multiple hardware wallets, and spread the amounts around, especially from different manufacturers. You can do what the top commenter mentioned, by physically building the device yourself. Basically, the idea is that the least that you have to depend on someone else to generate your key, the better of you are going to be. There's diminishing returns though. You can go through a lot of trouble to protect a couple thousand $$s worth, or you can go with a suitable amount of protection that matches the amount you are trying to protect. Paper wallets are completely offline, but people could argue that you could technically write a paper wallet generator software to steal the private key, or if you put it in the view of a webcam, someone could have hacked your webcam and stolen it.... Paranoia is good when you have a lot of money that people are trying to steal. It's a waste of time if you have a couple hundred or a couple thousand. Right now, a keepkey is pretty damn protective for the amount I have. If that amount starts to rise exponentially, I would probably be looking for other options also, to spread the risk.

I agree, it's the calm before the perfect storm. 
The US has the largest user centric bitcoin infrastructure (Bitpay, Bitwage, Coinbase, over 700 bitcoin ATMs, bitcoin debit cards etc etc) with the least amount of need for it at the moment. 
On the other hand, Argentina flocked to bitcoin when their financial crisis hit. Greece the same back in 2013, china does when they get scared. It has a historical track record of being a value safe haven in recent years. Obviously gold is a good hedge for historical reasons, but most people who own gold own it in an etf, which frankly isn't any better than bitcoin. In a truly shtf situation, you can't bank on the people actually holding the gold in your etf to honor some legal agreements that you own it. And when the system comes crashing down, are the gold exchanges going to be able to handle the masses trying to purchase gold?
Then on the other hand, let's say you hold your gold personally... well now you are at risk to be ambushed and it can be physically stolen quite easily. Expect for cops and other people in power to become very corrupt when things start getting very bad. But let's say that you are able to protect your physical asset, you still have the divisibility problem. Your 1/4 oz coin is rapidly increasing in value every day, but you can't just take a hacksaw to it to spend what you need. On the other hand, numbers in databases divide quite nicely and bitcoin is much much more usable and spendable than gold. 
We bandaid fixed the 2008 crisis with public debt, and the debt will continue to rise, and eventually we will get to a point of inflation where things will start to fall apart. It will cascade worldwide, and we will see Great Depression levels of bad luck hit people as all the money created out of thin air disappears and the only things that can be trusted are assets with fixed scarcity. Bitcoin will be staring the public in the face, and that "drug dealing money" that everyone thought was long gone but now they realize is going strong after 8 years worth of development, and the masses will flock to it. 
THAT is what will make bitcoin usage mainstream. Not the desire to use it (because only us nerds really care about the possibilities) but the necessity to use it.

Segwit fixes mutability making many off chain scaling solutions possible. LN is one of the first. 
Anyone of course can obviously make a transaction on chain if they want, but as we see, space on the blockchain is a scarecrow resource, so there's a market price for it. 
It would make sense to make your payment for a cup of coffee through a LN node at like a $.05 transaction cost, but you are free to make it on chain if you feel the need.

You seriously need to read on basic economic principles before involving yourself in economic discussions. 
["Consumer preferences are defined as the ***subjective*** (individual) tastes, as measured by utility, of various bundles of goods. They permit the consumer to rank these bundles of goods according to the levels of utility they give the consumer. Note that preferences are independent of income and prices. ***Ability to purchase goods does not determine a consumer’s likes or dislikes.*** One can have a preference for Porsches over Fords but only have the financial means to drive a Ford."](
Just because you think it isn't possible for a market to remain decentralized (again, you're wrong in that, but I'll work with you here) doesn't mean that objective availability of a product has any affect on the entirely *subjective* property of consumer preferences. 
This is a fundamental principle of any study of economics, and if you wish to have an educated discussion on economics you have to concede to that. This isn't my opinion, this is as fundamental as addition is to mathematics. The study of economics can not exist without consumer preferences being the independent variable of demand. 
Even if (I'm working with you here), the market is entirely centralized, there is no reason I can't still prefer a decentralized system, even though non is available. The ***Demand*** for such a system still exists, and if one is introduced, when presented with the exact same product with the only difference being the implicit property of "decentralization", you are defying logic and the basic fundamentals of economics if you would say that I wouldn't chose the decentralized version over the centralized version. Because I *choose* one over the other, that is undeniable proof that a preference for decentralization can and does exist.

Even if LN is overhyped, other proposals will pick up the slack. Free markets have that property, where if there's profits to be made with a better solution, people come up with better solutions. 
We are already seeing off chain payments through semitrusted parties right now. If you operate within the coinbase ecosystem you pay no fees, bitpay the same, most exchanges the same.
The blockchain is intended for trustless transactions, and there's a price to pay for such a secure method of payment in a trustless environment. We just aren't used to that because up until this point everything has been semitrust based. And for the most part, that's fine for our everyday lives. I have faith that when I use my debit card with Wells Fargo, that wells isn't just going to up shop tomorrow and run off with my money. When things are going well, that works out well. The problem with that system is when things don't go well, we end up in the mercy of those parties we entrusted (see 2008). This is why it is imperative to have the option of an entirely trustless method of storing value. I'm ok if I have to pay $5 to transfer a large amount of funds if it means that in a 2008 situation, my stored value is sound. If I need to buy a coffee or something, I can either use a semitrust off chain system, or I can choose to pay the going rate for an ultra secure transaction if I deem it warranted.
In reality, people are going to develop off chain semi trust transaction systems, and take advantage of the volume of small fees, and the relatively low cost of shoring up those transactions. Much like Visa and MasterCard being built upon the current financial system. If they get burnt on a $3 coffee that gets charged back, it's a cost of business. We don't need to compromise decentralization so that all transactions can be entirely trustless, because then they are no longer trustless.

Please don't fall for the semantic twisting of people who don't understand economics.
Socialism *is a defined economic term*, in which the means of production are owned by society as a whole, and there is no such thing as private ownership. If you start changing that meaning, then you have to go back and modify hundreds of years of economic study.
A social democracy is by no means a socialist system. Just because Bernie sanders calls himself a socialist, but pushes for social democracy, doesn't mean the meanings of the words has changed. That just means Bernie fell asleep in economics 101.
Its the equivalent of confusing addition with subtraction. Pathetic at best, dangerous at the worst.

The DAO hasn't been solved. Prediction markets haven't been perfected. There's still other useful problems that we can't even comprehend yet, that will be a result of problems people run into while coding alternatives to already existing solutions. People build software in layers, in a modular fashion. Facebook didn't develop SSH, they simply use the tools that coders before developed. They didn't develop databases, they simply use the tools that were previously developed. Facebook didn't develop TCP/IP, they simply used the tools previously developed. Facebook didn't develop email, they simply used the tools previously developed. And let me tell you, TCP/IP-Email combination was pointless because we already had a telephone network that could transmit the same information via fax.
With Visa, I have to hand over all my information and allow for third parties to track my every financial move. Bitcoin is hardly on the worldwide radar in terms of financial market share, and only recently showed up about a year or so earlier.
Linux was solving something that already had a solution.
Courts are stupid. They are arbitrary entities that operate in the realm of subjectivity, and are outdated technologies. We now have the technology to enforce rules in a 100% objective behavior. If we create laws by combining various layers of contracts on top of each other (just like how programs are formed), we can ensure a fair court system that doesn't care at all how rich/poor you are, what the color of your skin is, what your gender is, or who you played golf with. If you objectively broke the law, you objectively broke the law.

I disagree that they don't make bitcoin more valuable. If they require bitcoin to run, they increase demand of bitcoin, and the value thus goes up. They will pay a fee like every other transaction. 
That would be like saying that Facebook or Google don't make the investment of ISP hardware more valuable. 
Unfortunately, the future isn't going to see the majority of people running on chain transactions directly, which is ok. Services will be built on top, and users use that directly. You are welcome to make an on chain transaction, but you will be paying the market rate to make a transaction on the worlds most secure blockchain. There are objective realities that need to be faced, and those include the limited resources of bandwidth, space, etc that larger blocks would affect. 
The primary purpose of bitcoin is that it is a store/transfer of value in an entirely trustless network. But most people don't operate in an entirely trustless world. I go to the same grocery store. Get my haircut at the same spot. I show my face in in-person transactions. I buy things on Amazon, a multi billion dollar enterprise that I could sue if they wronged me. They have my address and could report me to the authorities if I wrong them. I could go on and on. The point is that normal people operate in the semitrust realm, thus I don't need the ultrasecurity of the bitcoin blockchain for a cup of coffee. That would be like the cashier holding a machine gun at your head until you paid.... a little overkill for the situation. 
Multi billion dollar deals, bank to bank transactions, hell even me selling a car on Craigslist may warrant me paying a dollar or two for the security of the blockchain. It would be cheaper and more secure than requiring a cashiers check. 
The point is, most people don't directly interact with TCP/IP in our day to day. We operate using technologies built on top of TCP/IP. Bitcoin is the protocol, on top of which, many different end user technologies will be developed. It's worth a slightly higher transaction cost to ensure a decentralized blockchain that has proven secure for almost a decade now.

Sure, that sounds romantic and all, and maybe you’ve had the wry rate experience of that actually happening, but in reality, that’s searching for a problem to apply a solution to. And yes there is, again, it’s illogical to sell something (which is effectively what you are doing by spending) that you expect to increase in value in the future. Hence the catch 22 and ultimate downfall of bitcoin as a currency. 


Because they are entirely speculative. Less than 10% of gold has actual industrial demand (outside of jewelry obviously), and like 7/10 of those percentage points are for dentistry for fillings. People buy gold and things made of gold because other people place high price targets on gold (irrationally I may add). Whenever your subjective valuation has to be based relative to other people’s subjective valuation, you are speculating. That’s basically the definition. In fact, just about every asset has some level of speculation. Bitcoin et all simply are 100% speculative. You are entirely banking on the hopes that someone will find a ledger entry, attached to a really big number equally as valuable as you find it, at some point in the future. 


Gold is also a terrible “investment”. If you see a downturn in economy coming, buy puts. Otherwise, keep holding income generating assets. Gold performed abysmally in 2008. 


Considering fiat is also 100% speculative, except the main difference is it isn’t viewed as an investment (thus it can *actually* facilitate trade), this isn’t some new, profound concept. The currency loses value over time by design. That’s what makes people *spend it*. You know, the entire thing you say gives bitcoin its “value”. 
A better alternative is an income generating asset. Income *generating*. All wealth in the modern world is a result of the combined economic efforts of every human who has ever walked on this earth. Bitcoin generates nothing. In fact, it consumes resources, at an ever exponentially growing rate. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:49:14


If this were actually true, you would be buying at every price lower than what your target price is, because by definition, every price below it is a profit opportunity. 
There’s no guarantee it will correct downwards, just like there’s no guarantee it will be higher in the future. So logically, if you think it is going to be higher at some point in the future, then there is no point in waiting for it to go lower. And if your target price is lower, it would make no logical sense to hold on to what you have. 
Tl;dr, you have loss aversion bias, and are simply gambling at this point.

I don’t really know at this point. I got fairly early on, for the same reason most people do, mainly FOMO and an overall Austrian economic outlook of the world. As the value started to grow, I went into the rabbit hole and wanted to learn everything I could about what bitcoin was and how it worked, and how the “coins” I bought on an exchange couldn’t just be copy and pasted into oblivion. I learned the nuts and bolts, and by doing that also learned it’s limitations. All while doing this, I watched as the entire space turned from an experiment, to rabid greed and complete disconnect from the underlying asset itself which is far from perfect. Not a single person was willing to acknowledge very real, and very limiting factors of the overall protocol. All that mattered was the price. No one even knew why. When you have socialists coming in and claiming that bitcoin is “for the people” when the very concept of what it was invented for completely contradicts their primary tool of action (wealth distribution through inflation) you know things have gone awry. 
I could see bitcoin holding a roll similar to what people see gold and silver as, at some point in the future, but I don’t ever see it being used as a currency. It can’t ever be used as a currency because of the hoarding aspect. That doesn’t mean money can’t be made from predicting the speculation, but it’s not a solid “investment” by any means. 
I think crypto will play a roll in the future, but just like I never would have predicted talking to a stranger about magic internet money on a public forum from a touchscreen device 25 years ago, I have no idea what roll it will play. My main prediction is that bitcoin will be looked at in the same purely speculative light as gold in the far future, primarily propped up by niche investors, and will simply be seen as another index to compare currencies and market sentiment to. I don’t see it being hundreds of thousands of dollars in real dollar terms at any point in my lifetime. 
Ultimately I understand and respect the research and development that goes into solving many of the critical problems in bitcoin, but I don’t see it as much more than an open source science project platform, of which the best parts are stripped and put into commercialized, watered down products.
With regards to using it for financial gain, at this point I view it primarily the same as gambling. There are far more certain actual investment opportunities, that at least pose some sort of connection to reality, and thus far more predictability than something like bitcoin, which primarily seems driven by if the vast majority of first time investors need to pull out their few hundred dollars worth simultaneously, or if manipulators/exchanges want to take advantage of “day traders”.

Again, you aren’t being logically consistent. 
If the price of an asset is lower than your target, then it would make sense to put as much as you were ever willing to put in, at any point in time, mutually exclusive from whether it is at its lowest or highest at a local point. 
The fact that you even pay attention to the short term trends is pretty much verifiable proof that you doubt the long term viability. 
If you rationally thought it would be worth substantially more in the future, it would make sense to put as much as you are willing to invest into it, at whatever present time you have the cash available. Local timing is mutually exclusive.

Within 10 years? Under 1k. There’s absolutely no sane person denying that the past year was pure uncontrolled mania. 
Bubbles are indicative of easy credit/liquidity. People have excess money to spend. The entire world just went through an experimental stimulus concept called “Quantitative Easing” which is coincidentally the reason bitcoin was created. Now central banks are reversing the efforts and undergoing “Quantitative Tightening” and removing that excess money. People have less money to spend, and it’s going to go to things like rising rent/mortgages with increased interest rate, and inflated consumer goods (which is the reason to increase interest rates anyways). Even with the threat of an interest rate hike in March, word markets tipped a notable amount. 
There’s about to be a tightening of things across the board. Think of weaning a patient off of opioids. There’s going to be far less money available for risky/speculative investments like bitcoin. That’s assuming the thether fraud is all nonexistent and they weren’t running their own QE scheme, which looks highly unlikely.

The odds of it dropping at any point in the future are the same exact odds of it increasing at any point in the future. Hence the nature of a purely speculative asset.

It literally is. The odds of it increasing or decreasing are entirely 50/50 and based upon someone else’s subjective valuation which is based off someone else’s subjective valuation, etc etc. 


I’d like to hear your argument for that. 


A stock is not a purely speculative asset. A stock has a book value, profit generating operations, and the promise of future dividends or decrease of dilution through buy backs. They aren’t even remotely close to each other, other than the fact they are traded on an open market. 
That being said, asset valuation is not exclusive to either, so the same principals apply. If the price of your asset is lower than your price target, it makes compete logical sense that you would continue to buy the maximum amount you are willing to put into an asset, as soon as the cash is available, because the odds of a correction (baring as you say the “fundamentals” haven’t changed) are the exact same as the odds of it doubling in price. Vanguard did a study specifically on this concept. By waiting, all you are doing is losing out on growth fueled by overall profitable/economic activity.
The fact that you are hesitant and aren’t willing to put the full amount you would put otherwise into bitcoin (or any other crypto) at any given time is proof alone that you don’t really trust your own price target. So once again, you are purely gambling on hopes and dreams. Which again, is fine, but disingenuous to involve others as you are doing by propagating the “strategy” of buying more on dips. 
In casinos, they call that “doubling down”.

No, mining a block, and thus reaching consensus in a constantly under attack network takes an enormous amount of energy, which is what makes it work. The number of transactions that can be represented by a single settlement transaction is infinite so pretending to extrapolate it to individual transactions just shows you clearly have a very limited understanding of the protocol. The cost of that energy is what aligns the economic incentives to make the system work. It’s why eth also has POW. POS has yet to be proven and is a pipe dream. 
And it takes the protocol 10 minutes to come to absolute global consensus. That’s not long at all.

It’s not electronic money. We already have that. It’s about the open/permission-less access to the financial system. You can’t do that on a centralized scale. 
A blockchain is simply a decentralized database. If you wall off the gardens, you don’t need a blockchain at that point.

You seem to think I’m talking about pinpointing prices. I’m not, I’m talking about market macros. It’s really not that complicated of a skill. 
To your point of calling the top, you can’t. I can’t. Instead, I took profits at all the points that could have been the top. That’s how you come out positive. And yes, as volatility increased, I took larger and larger portions of profits. In fact, to mirror your point exactly, I sold double digit bitcoins the day before we it 19.5k for around 14k a pop, which was about 80% of what I had left. Would it have been nice to get the absolute top? Sure. But when you see the froth occurring like it did, you don’t try and maximize profits at the expense of everything. Looking back at the charts, I don’t have a regret in the world with taking profits at any of the points I did. There’s quite a few people now regretting not taking profits.
“Hodl” is a fucking meme and was the reason this was overblown. Of course if the general sentiment is to hold and not sell, the price will sky rocket. That doesn’t take a trader to know that. I’m no trader, I just happen to have a lick of economic sense to realize things don’t grow exponentially forever. 


Sure, at least until you don’t see bitcoin in the news anymore and it will be below $8000 next month, probably much more below. See how that works? Macros. You don’t have to know the exact bottom to know we’re going to continue going down.

Cool idea but I’m curious your Benefit from this and the cost of energy for cooling and if it breaks even. 
Was about to spend around $50k in a mining setup a few months back and from my understanding, while the heat and noise is enormous, it’s not actually a problem if simply vented properly. The cards are designed to last at elevated temperatures. 
So if you aren’t getting any performance increase, and the slight longevity increase you may get from keeping the hardware cool (even though they are designed to work just fine in heat), it doesn’t make much sense to me other than being a cool, nerdy “art” project of sorts. Doesn’t seem to have very practical use.

No, you clearly didn’t even read the article. The main difference between investing and gambling is that there’s fixed odds against you in gambling. There’s no such thing as a “safe” place for wealth storage. There’s always some level of risk. Even in bonds, there’s a level of risk. The difference is if the odds go low enough, your reward amount over time is outweighed by your loss amount, through the law of large numbers. 
9/10 startups fail, but that doesn’t mean that every single startup is a “gamble”. There are many factors that contribute to the overall end result of a startup. 
I’m not going to play some dick measuring game on Reddit of who has more investment experience, when you very clearly can’t distinguish between gambling and investing, and how risk/reward structures work, and simple statistical concepts such as the law of averages.

No, your capital gains is not 50%. Short term capital gains is your regular income tax rate on a marginal basis. 
And you are limited to $3k per year, but you can spread the losses over multiple years. 
The point isn’t to convince people to time the market, the point is to point out the logical inconsistencies with “I buy at a discount when it drops”. If your price target is higher in the future, than any point lower that that price target would make sense to buy as much as you would at any other time because there’s no guarantee it will ever be lower. 
The fact your brain is telling you that is a bad idea is the logical center of your brain chipping in the fact that you have absolutely nothing beyond hopes and dreams that it will ever be higher than it is right now. It’s entirely speculative.

Because most nodes have a minimum fee set to even relay a transaction and it would never make it to the miner mempool. The only way it arrives in the miner mempool is if the miner puts it there themselves. 
And if it has a fee, then the cost of this attack is astronomical if you are counting this as a complete loss. If you are only losing ~50%, but gaining the increase in fees because of fee estimation, then it probably comes out net even or possibly even positive.

Got home, and used a block explorer to look up the transaction... the machine returned the change to the distribution address... looked up the address and there were daily, regular transactions for what at the time were all just below $300 worth. Clearly someone was laundering money with the machine, but if the software wasn't flagging it, it could theoretically go undetected forever.

Trading in a vacuum is gambling. Plain and simple. Past performance has no bearing on future performance, so technical analysis is all bullshit. Anyone can make money "trading" when the entire market is trending upwards. It just involves being in the market. 
Any trader worth his salt understand what he's investing in. Even in the stock market, day traders are specialized in certain markets. I was an analyst for the O&amp;G markets, and would write daily reports, from an engineering standpoint, on what was happening in the market, and the traders would use that to inform their trades. Pricing models are much more based on things like earnings and debt ratios than market momentum. If a trader simply bought/sold on an "analysis" of market momentum, eventually they will get crushed.

When you spend bitcoin, you are essentially spending a bunch of spends to you. If I give you $5 and someone else gives you $5, you could buy something for $10 by pointing to my $5 transaction, and your others. The recipient of your $10 transaction could then spend it by referencing it in any transaction. 
A lot of times, payments fragment smaller and smaller, leaving you with lots of small inputs. To spend the total amount you need to point to all the small inputs. All those inputs take up space. A 1MB block can only hold so much transaction data. We could make the blocks bigger, but it would increase the size of the blockchain exponentially, and the bigger we get, the more and more specialized equipment is needed to run a node (bandwidth limitations, storage limitations, computing power to verify the incoming block). Basically, bigger blocks would lead to centralization. But small blocks have lead us to where we are fee wise, with no alternatives. 
Segwit is an option that has been proposed, that uses programming and math trickery to move data outside the 1MB block limit, thus increasing the blocksize to about 2MB. It also fixes a problem called malleability, that would make other 2nd layer payment options for smaller payments much faster and cheaper. For a bunch of political reasons, and corruption reasons, a few miners in China are effectively fillabustering this from being implemented.

That was a whole lot of inapplicable 19th century bullshit to basically completely incorrectly define capitalism...
Capitalism is the individual ownership of the factors of production. That’s all. 
And no, you don’t need a state to have that. If I have a rock big enough to bash your head in, I can lay claim to something, and unless you can forcibly take it away from me, it is mine. Cavemen had property. Capitalism is the natural order of things. Voluntary transactions to maximize your possessions is a function of capitalism, because we know from actual economic study that specialization of skills always results in increased wealth all around.

I cashed out a very substantial amount, and understand that I owe capital gains taxes. I typically owe in the neighborhood of a few $K every year because of an LLC I am apart of that doesn’t do proper withholding. I don’t see cash flow from it (equity generating) and the company just pays the taxes owed and the penalty at tax time anyways, so it’s not viable/worth it to pay estimated taxes or have additional withdrawn from the money I actually live on. Fucked up, I know, but that’s a whole different story for a whole different time. 
This time, I’m going to owe 10s of thousands on top of the few thousand. From what I understand the deadline for the estimated tax deadline was 1/15, and so I’ll pay an interest rate prorated from that point... Due to never having to do such a substantial amount before, and the penalty being relatively low, I currently just have the money sitting in a savings account pulling whatever the competitive interest rate is, so I don’t lose it in an investment gone south. I have more than enough to cover the liability, but I still have a bad feeling that waiting and owing 10s of thousands is going to be a bad idea. 
How much am I fucking up/drawing unwanted attention to myself by not paying the estimated tax. If they get the full amount and the penalty, does it matter? Should I pay it late? Is there a way to ACH literally 10s of thousands of dollars of estimated taxes for the layman?

Bitcoin on an exchange does not equal “bitcoin”.
You can audit the amount of bitcoin at any particular point in time by simply doing the math, block by block, and counting the block reward. You can trade all of those coins to their current address as well. It’s not possible to create new coins that are not part of the block reward and there are rules as to how much the block reward can be. If any new coins are trying to be created, the block gets rejected. It’s literally impossible to cheat and still be on the same chain. It’s trivially easy to check. 
What happened was, when you put money into the exchange, bitcoin was transferred on chain into one of their wallet addresses, and they credited your account in their own database. 
When you withdrew, they send coins, from their wallet, to the wallet on the new exchange, and should have deducted the .05 btc from your account. If they didn’t, when they send the .05 btc a second time, they are sending money that was either theirs, or accounted to be someone else’s. But no new bitcoin’s were created. 
Hopefully this is a single isolated event. Likely with computer code, they have a serious bug and will be eating the cost until the go insolvent. Hopefully this isn’t a major exchange we are talking about.

That’s interesting and I could see where the work/research can come into use, especially in a situation where mining becomes illegal/frowned upon and needs to go underground. 
But I’m still sort of wondering if you are recuperating your money from a “net project” standpoint. Is this viable at scale? Because a hole in the wall and a ventilation fan isn’t a substantial amount of capex imo. 
Sorry for the questions and what may seem accusatory, it’s not meant that way. I just happen to be an engineer in the energy industry, and energy/cosy balancing is always on our radar and this just doesn’t seem cost viable if the situation doesn’t require it (covert mining for example). 
Also, out of curiosity, do you have a thermodynamic efficiency for the system? How much heat are you actually recovering, and at what temperature? If it is scalable, you could possibly run regenerative processes that could be sold off and recoup most the money and further justify the expenditure. 
Ps: also, the 10% overclocking is interesting, are you seeing any substantial increase in returns from your extra hashing power from that? Is there a break even point/number of machines needed that could justify it?

They will either have to roll back interest rates to prop the economy up again letting things inflate further, or we will have a massive bear market as we correct back to real valuations.

I don't believe I ever claimed as such? I did claim, that it isn't being adopted as a payment method due to volatility risk, which has been cited over and over and over. And it is subject to volatility because of such a low market capitalization. Who on earth wants to spend bitcoin, when they know a future valuation of it is orders of magnitudes higher (based purely on its equivalent properties to gold), and within a year it could very well be worth multiple times more? That would be like finding real gold for sale for $5 an oz, and spending it at $25 an oz, when the true market price is much, much larger. 


That's a fundamental misunderstanding of bitcoin. Bitcoin is effectively infinitely divisible without inflating the overall supply so there is no such thing as "not enough in circulation". Prices simply drop in relation to overall valuation.  


Again, bitcoin is a terrible currency due to volatility, the mandatory 30 minute transaction period to have a secure transaction, the lack of privacy, the lack of fungibility, and the necessity of fees in order for the protocol to work successfully. The adoption (or lack there of) has much more to do with those problems than people holding onto it. 


Again, no, people aren't going to spend something that is up 400% ytd. It makes no financial sense. "Speculative valuation" is giving something a value based off of future predictions, so in a sense you are correct the entire price of bitcoin is speculative based, but then again so is any money. And just because we base our valuation on things that haven't happened yet doesn't mean they *wont happen*. In fact, most of what people have predicted has happened, or is happening, so the speculative valuation is tending towards to true valuation (that with a market cap on the order or precious metals).

If you have something that was worth ~$1k in January, and is worth ~$17k in December with absolutely nothing fundamentally different, you’re a fool if you don’t see that as a melt up which is almost always followed by a melt down. 
No one knows the future, but it’s not too hard to make an educated guess as to what happens next.
For example, I don’t know that there’s not an asteroid 5x the size of earth headed on a collision path at near the speed of light right now, and will obliterate us in the near future, but i can make a reasonable assumption that the future does not hold such an event. 
Another example, if I see a cigarette bud laying on the ground at a gas station, with still a trickle of smoke, and a hose dripping a leak nearby, it’s not 100% certainty that there will be ignition, but if nothing is done, one can assume bad things will ensue. 
So when you have Jill from accounting giving a blockchain keynote at your local meetup, when Jill doesn’t even know how to setup a shared drive on her computer, you 8 year old nephew giving you their favorite coin picks, and the entire crypto market growing by 32x+ in a year, you can reasonably accept that there’s going to be a correction soon. Especially when we have multiple frothy drop offs in quick succession.

The general sentiment is don’t do anything that you haven’t logically thought through, and thus have a plan for. No one is saying you can’t adjust your *plan*. But if the price starts tanking and it doesn’t fit your model view of the market, you should research and fully understand what is happening, and update your plan accordingly. If a move then fits that plan, take it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:12:06
Yes, but by the nature of how the protocol works, it cannot spend the same. It is equivalent to you having your own counterfeit detection machine. 
In case you aren’t aware, it works like everyone tracking everyone’s finances on a spreadsheet. Every “block” is a list of updates to the spreadsheet that you independently verify. Each one of those transactions requires the funds to be there first and an address to lock them to. You can create a carbon copy, but you are effectively copying and pasting the spreadsheet and playing with your own version. If you try and spend any coins you don’t have the private keys to, it is trivially easy to see that, and not only will it not work, you will literally be excommunicated from anyone who disagrees with you. 
Just like what happened in the case of bcash, they can make a copy, but only the group of people running that protocol see it as value. You can’t accidentally accept bcash in place of bitcoin. It’s literally impossible. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:42:58
No, but I also could care less what someone who doesn't even understand the fundamentals of a basic bitcoin transaction, thinks about its valuation.
Do you ask a homeless person for investment advice? How about your barber about your car troubles?
So how on earth does a management type assess the underlying valuation of a technical project, that has been under constant open source development for over 8 years, by some of the brightest minds on the planet, as "a fraud"? In my opinion, that simply shows awful leadership/management characteristics. Managers don't need to know the details of how things get done, but they need to know when the people they manage have sound ideas and when they are full of shit. Calling bitcoin "a fraud" doesn't even make semantic sense, and fundamentally represents an ignorance to what bitcoin as a protocol is.

8 years, up 300% ytd with a chain split and a scaling problem within the same time period, and still chugging along just fine. Curious why you think it is prone to infighting? Because some nerds on Reddit bicker about it? Come on. If you think that's all there is to bitcoin, you are missing out on some absolute brilliant work happening behind the scenes. 
And there's a difference between changing your preference search engine, what service you use for social media, *and where you choose to store a significant amount of monetary value*. Bitcoin isn't just going to "disappear" because there's something better. It set the bar by being open source, so even if something was objectively better, bitcoin could simply adopt the code. And no non-open source currency would ever take preference over an inherently *open* currency. 
And such an argument is moot anyways because we've had hundreds of fiat currencies around the world, all floating in value in relation to each other, and all 100% gaining their value from purely demand. You could make the same claim about the USD. What if the Yen becomes stronger? Will everyone just dump the USD and hold onto the next currency that gains headway? No, because most people don't care to uproot their financial basing because of some possible value increase.

Given a great internet connection, and set not to keep a copy of the mempool, only validate blocks? I'm taking a wild guess, but I would imagine 4MB worth of script data would probably be pushing the limits. 
If someone designs an open source ASIC/circuit hardware option to process script transactions and validate blocks, I'd be all for a substantial block size increase (up to the limits of bandwidth, which I would estimate 6Mbps is a good lower end today... pretty good considering a T1 connection in early internet was 1Mbps for an entire campus). This will increase in time. Storage costs is not my concern. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:25:37
Bitcoin needs to become a asset of equivalent value for all other comparable assets before it becomes a currency. Rapid price swings are indicative of it still reaching its true market value. Which imo is orders of magnitude higher than the current price.
Once bitcoin becomes comparable in valuation to that of precious metals, volatility will decrease substantially. The amount of coins held has effectively 0 long term effect other than how quickly we get to such a valuation.

Even the valuation that they have now is largely because most people don't know how to/can't access their bitcoin cash in order to dump it. I had to use the beta version of my keepkey client to access mine. 
If they play this game again, I'm going to move my coins to my full node right before the split, split my coins to protect myself from replay after the split, and dump again, sending it all back to my keepkey. 
I would fee bad because the "free money" is really just taking that money from the suckers willing to buy the altcoin, but at this point, if you choose the alt over the real thing, you deserve to lose your money. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:35:09
Step 1: Look at properties of bitcoin and give it a valuation without even looking at the current price.
Step 2: Look at current price and compare your valuation to it. 
Step 3: if valuation &gt; current price buy, if valuation is &lt; current price, sell/short. 
Given that if your valuation is higher than both the peak price and the dip price, it would make more sense, mathematically, to buy on a dip (buy low), than it would to buy on a short term rise (buy high). 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:56:32
Also depends on how much you have. Couple hundred dollars worth, breadwallet on a phone will do just fine. Couple thousand dollars worth, you should invest in a hardware wallet. 
Either way, you should have access to a word seed which is effectively equivalent to your private keys, so that you can plug that into a different wallet if the one you are currently using does not support the features/chain you want.

Cell phones were very expensive at first too. High fees are temporary. Any other system with low fees right now isn’t sustainable. Really, with all the bank to bank apps, any system with any noticeable fees is losing. So right now they are all losers and are overhyped. Hence the crash. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:55:46
Miners can choose to include whatever valid transactions they want in a block, including those without fees. So, if a miner has some political ploy they want to implement (like spamming the network), they could very easily choose to forego the opportunity cost of transactional fees for the long term play of pursuing a political goal, which is what we are seeing here.
In this case, they may be including fees just to make them appear as typical transactions, and to bump up the median fee cost and trick fee estimation software into picking higher fees, but it is effectively a net 0 cost, or minimal loss if they are mining most of their own transactions and getting the fee back as part of the reward.

Yes, an 80% rise over 3 months most definitely qualifies as a bull market. 
This isn't semantics. You literally cannot have a 100% increase in value, and still consider it a bear market. That's simply illogical. 
And sure, if you time the market and buy at each and every dip exactly at the bottom and sell exactly at the top, you will come out ahead. But that is timing the market and isn't DCA. 
Edit: also, your spreadsheet shows a comparison on whether someone was to buy  outright at the moment, or buy over time. Again, that's not your argument. Of course your average cost basis will decrease in a bear market. That's the point. But compare portfolio cost basis, to portfolio value at any point in time, and you will be in negative %, hence, not profiting.

The problem is multifaceted and complex, as you would imagine the real world application of *anything* is. The people thinking wind/solar can handle our grid usually have 0 experience in the energy industry, and those who think that we can just burn all the fossil fuels we want just got rocked by one of the worst storms in recorded history (arguably influenced by climate change). 
The main problems with solar panels are that, like everything manufacturing, they take electricity to manufacture. A LOT of energy. More so than most purely solar grids are setup for. So when you use coal plants, in china, you have cheap energy, and you can mass produce them, at the expense of a carbon footprint, and then get the long term cost effects of a solar panel. It's most definitely not carbon neutral though. The use of coal in the us is very expensive, and that's why LNG is being phased in. China just doesn't give a shit. 
Also, just like any other market, the cost effectiveness fluctuates pending all sorts of factors. And purchasing of power is very much influenced by both immediate costs, and long term analysis. The choice between coal and solar can depend entirely on a few cents per kWh at any point in time. 
Then you have to deal with storage. Battery creation is not green whatsoever. So when it's an overcast, or at night, there is no generation. Industry doesn't just stop because it isn't sunny outside. And industry directly affects your ability to do many things that you like. Consumers are detached from the realities of industry on our first world lifestyles. Those nasty chemical plants everyone hates? Those are only there because they make chemicals that people buy. Specifically large enterprise customers who use them in the production of Starbucks cups, Apple products, and those "green" reusable grocery bags (what's wrong with reusing regular plastic bags, why a new bag?), coincidentally hipsters 3 favorite things. The best method of energy storage I've seen so far is mechanical flywheels, which are expensive, don't store a ton of energy, and take up a lot of space. 
And yes batteries and solar panels die over time. As do wind turbines. In fact, I've heard (anecdotal from colleagues who invested in wind) that the only reason to buy a wind turbine is to collect on the subsidy, and that their reliability is abysmal. For reference, I recently visited a coal plant, converting to natural gas, that was built in the 1910s. 
The real solution is nuclear, which is pretty much shot now that Westinghouse is bankrupt.
I'm not saying solar/wind are bad. I think all houses should be powered by solar. And if your office complex has a bunch of computers? Shade the parking lot with solar panels. But this pipe dream that somehow solar can just solve all of our problems and that big oil is the boogeyman is just pure horseshit. It's simply immaturity and negligence to the realities of the situation. If you really want to save to environment, buying new solar panels isn't going to help. **Reduce**, reuse, recycle. Without a viable long term net neutral power source (no solar isn't one), the only long term solution of saving the environment is going to be responsible living at the consumer end. Like I said, if you aren't going to buy it, we aren't going to sell it. That's capitalism.

Lol k. Just like Ripple was taking over a few weeks ago ����.


Do you understand the concept of why we have a block time? Do you know what orphaning is? Tell me, why not just make the block time .0001ms?
And it’s expensive to transfer, because someone else sees that transactional space on a provably immutable ledger, etched into eternity, backed by billions of dollars worth of expenses energy as more valuable than you do, and there’s limited space there. It’s called market economics, and it ensures there’s no shortages. Bitcoin isn’t a charity. The fact that blocks are full is exactly why bitcoin is working. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, every ~10 minutes without fail. If I remember correctly, ethereum has had quite a few massive fuck ups recently. I know, because I still hold a very substantial amount, even after divesting after seeing this massive bubble. 






That brand name is called resiliency. The fact that it’s basically impossible to change is called resiliency. [Here’s]( a good example of the difference. 








Lol kid, I divested more than you could ever dream of owning in your life. Would you like to pay my tax bill this year?
Take it from someone who quite literally probably still owns an order of magnitude more bitcoin *and* eth than you, after unloading literally 6 figures worth in December, that bitcoin is here to stay. You don’t have to believe me, but burying your head in the sand won’t help you either.

I work in the oil and gas industry. We supply an appetite for energy, and the most effective way of satisfying that appetite is though the use of heat engines. They are by far the most effective way of fueling the society you live in. 
Wind/Solar is a cool novelty for residential power levels where you charge your phone, run your computer, and a few other small appliances. But it doesn't hold a candle to the amount of energy consumption required of mechanical equipment that is vital to the facade you see around you. The consumption driven society is what is destroying the environment, not solely the energy companies that fuel it.

That’s a use case, not a value. Not to mention it has yet to do all three of those efficiently to date. 


Agreed, but that’s mutually exclusive from bitcoin/crypto. The same fact doesn’t necessarily give my shoe “intrinsic value”. 


I highly doubt this, considering again, your view of bitcoin is an investment. That’s what separates a currency from an investment. Currencies aren’t investments. Forex money is made through arbitrage, not by buying a specific asset and holding it. 


Interesting considering I’ve been in the game for far far longer than many people here. I just see reality for what it is. I don’t agree with what the fed does, but that doesn’t mean I’m not going to make money on it, knowing what the plan is. I know far more about bitcoin, and the “underlying technology” than you probably imagine I do, which is why I see its glaring flaws as-is. I invest in objective reality, not on hopes and dreams. 


Gold and silver are not valuable either, they are majorly speculative too. 
And is bitcoin a currency or a commodity? The entire purpose of currency is to decouple it from commodities in order to have a constant medium of exchange. You seem to want to take the best of both worlds in your argument, and it doesn’t work that way.

But most people aren't even going to try. BCH had replay protection in it, but 90% of the coins haven't even moved. You think a noob who doesn't know how to split their coins is going to dump S2X?
The entire premise of the OP is to scare people into believing somehow if they don't actively fight S2X they will lose their real bitcoins. Nothing could be further from the truth.

In short, you are gambling, not investing.

Socialism is a system of control, and so yes, those in charge of the monetary policy influence control systems like welfare states. Welfare states very rarely lift people out of poverty by their very nature. They do however grow as left leaning power gains influence. 
Private banks, are separate from the central banks, and are simply profit seeking entities, just like any other corporation, playing by the rules and usually leveraging policy put into place by left leaning parties to their advantage. Hence the 13,000 page tax code in the us. Hence the “everyone deserves a home” Clinton era in the early 2000s. Worked out well.

Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this is so drastically inefficient, it is borderline stupid. Not only do you incur the network fees, you also incur trading fees or markup costs in your conversion back into crypto, and then again network fees to replenish your channel. That is of course, assuming you are using lightning network, which is the only remotely viable way to transfer peer to peer. 0 conf transactions are not safe especially when traffic is heavy and orphaning is at its highest, and when traffic is heavy, fees are high in order to be included in a reasonably timely block. Then you have to wait for the confirmations. All while opening yourself up to a  regular 5% swing in value during that time. Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard actually pay me to use their protocol through cash back and rewards programs. 
Then again, I, like 99.9% of the world don’t really have a need for off the grid money and have never had my bank account frozen for any reason. Until that changes, I still see that part of it as a made up problem to make the solution make sense. 


Wrong, the price of gold comes from the speculative demand. The utility comes from its conductive and ductile properties, along with its pleasing look. Gold isn’t used as money any more and it was stopped as money for good reason. Mostly because it sucks. Even in your wet dream SHTF scenario where we have a fallout like Venezuela, no one will care about your bitcoin or your gold. I’ve been in a catastrophe situation, relatively recently, during hurricane Harvey, where the place I was living was flooded, mostly destroyed, and people were crowded in dry areas with no food or water. I could have held up 10lbs of gold and no one would have taken it over a pack of waters. Why? Because no one cares about what other people think of gold’s price when they are at very real risk of dying without fresh water in the near future. 
I’m done reading, but long story short, you clearly don’t understand the difference between price and value.

The encoded transaction is simply a serialized hexadecimal format of the transaction. 
48656c6c6f205800000000 is a hexadecimal representation of the binary output above. 
[Chapter 6 of Mastering Bitcoin]( goes into better detail. 
In the case of a bitcoin transaction, the raw transaction is converted into a string of hexadecimal letters, which can be transmitted by byte, and reconstructed, and then entered into another full node that can decode the hexadecimal format to any other format it wants. 
This is also different from “pay to script hash” type transactions, which have a hash of a script as the encumbrance mechanism and  the coins can only be unlocked by presenting the script that matches the hash later.

You could always just replace with fee, because if the transaction hasn't gone through, the UTXO is still valid and can be used in any transaction.

Node numbers don't matter, economic activity of such nodes matters.
Sort of like if I set up 5 radios, listening to the same radio station. Sure the number of radios goes up, but their listener count and potential revenue doesn't go up because I'm the only one listening to all of them. They haven't effectively added more listeners to advertise to. 
The only real reason to have a node is so that you can know the UTXO state, and create/validate transactions off of it. If all I'm doing is watching, it doesn't matter. What matters is when I go to create a transaction, based off my node's UTXO set, that such a transaction will be valid on the chain I want to spend on.
So really you probably have 3 types of users:
-Those who actively use/trade/move bitcoin, in which case they are almost certainly aware of the events. If not, shame on them honestly. 
-Those who actively accept bitcoin/spend bitcoin, which I think is the smallest portion of users, and they are the only ones susceptible to being tricked. I think with the level of technical knowledge you need to use bitcoin at this point in time, plus it's idiosyncrasies, anyone in this group is at least aware that something is going on. They should make sure whatever service they use will have access to the chain they prefer. Also, you can't send coins cross chain, so if someone splits their coins, you can't accidentally accept the wrong ones if you are on the same node. 
-Those who are hodling. In which case, they are not creating transactions, and it doesn't matter which chain their service is looking at in the short term, as long as they get access long term. Again, they are likely aware of the situation, or if they are like my dad and have no idea and just bought and forgot, frankly, it won't matter to them anyways because they are expecting a lottery ticket. Worst case scenario, S2X succeeds, becomes valuable, but the core chain will have forked and will remain technically superior and also hold value over time. Either way, people in this group would gain. 
Frankly I think this is going to be a non issue. Just like bcash was effectively a non issue. There's a vast divide between lottery ticket holders and active users, and any active user knows S2X for what it is, which is why the futures are so low. S2Xs entire plan is to hijack end user services so that unaware people don't notice, but they don't realize that unaware people aren't moving bitcoin anyways, they are hoping to get rich quick.

Again, you haven't answered the fundamental question of how can someone claim to have oversight of *a financial entity* without having any idea of the *financial status* of that entity.
It would be the equivalent of me saying, as a US citizen, I have oversight of the US nuclear program... Technically, because by the constitution the US government is granted into existence *by the people* (including me), and the US nuclear program is owned by the US government, then you can draw a paper connection between me and the US nuclear program. Although I have 0 information about anything regarding the US nuclear program.
The Fed is an entirely separate entity, granted its existence by the federal government, and that's it. They can say they have control over it, but the reality is, it is a private contractor given a monopoly on monetary supply and is 100% responsible for the debt mess we are in today.

No, anyone can replay transactions on either chain. There's really no benefit to doing so, other than to cause mayhem, but you have to expect that there are going to be parties replaying all transactions they can from the legacy chain to the S2X chain, just to make it difficult to split/dump the coins.
And that transaction fee comes from *your transaction*. The fee is just the difference between inputs and outputs. For example, if I have a UTXO with 5BTC, and I spend 1 to you, give myself change of 3.9, then it leaves .1 BTC as a fee for the miner. So whatever your fee in the initial transaction was, will be the same exact fee on the other chain if the transaction is picked up in a block. 
If you are sending the bitcoin from yourself to yourself on chain 1, then if it is replayed on chain 2, it would still be under your control, albeit it would also be moved, minus the tx fee, and you still haven't successfully split the coins. This is what attacks are mostly going to do. Make it extremely difficult to split the coins and then dump them, hoping to keep the price propped up.
And that article describes the previous "attempt" at a replay protection from S2X, but it was rescinded because it is idiotic and would mess up the possibility of LN on S2X in the future (I don't know the details on how unfortunately).

There's a tin foil hat conspiracy that lightning networks are going to be astronomically expensive to setup, and the fee size for on chain transactions will be prohibitively high, so it might tend to centralization. These are fake ads, trying to portray such a world. In reality, as time progresses, hardware will make validating larger blocks much cheaper and accessible, and block sizes will increase in time. 
Craig's proposal, is to just go ahead and centralize full nodes anyways, in order to avoid the *potential* of transaction availability from becoming prohibitively expensive for an average person. In his mind, if you don't have $20k to blow on a full node, you don't deserve to run one and should "fuck off" (literally, he said that). 
In contrast, cell phones, internet access, and even cars were expensive at first until infrastructure was developed to bring them to the masses. In one case you hold off on centralization waiting for that infrastructure to develop, in the other you definitely centralize part of the network, with hopes the other side won't centralize anyways (and if retail banking has a say, it will).

Fortunately those with the loudest most obnoxious opinions also don’t know how to code so it works itself out. Those who do in the developer community tend to cluster around the same projects. You only have to run the iteration you agree with. 


Bitcoin isn’t infinite supply though. That’s like me mining fools gold trying to inflate gold. Or saying that finding more silver inflated the value of gold. By the very nature of the bitcoin protocol, you can’t send bitcoin if you first don’t receive bitcoin somehow. And in case you are unaware, coins arent able to be sent interchangeable. Even atomic transactions require the coins the be available and spendable on either chain. 


ACH also takes days to settle, but we build an entire money system off of it. Bitcoin settles in 10 minuteswhich is ridiculously fast in terms of modern finance (24+ hours). You are confusing settlement with payment which are entirely different propositions. It’s a common mistake, but with further investigation you will realize the error.

You don't understand the purpose of a blockchain apparently. 
The blocks represent the valid transactions for a given time period. Once a node receives a block, it checks each and every transaction, individually, and then if the block is valid, it propagates it to the next nodes. This process takes time. That time also increases, usually non linearly, with transaction increases. 
You can not just "keep adding transactions to the blocks". Eventually, you will get to a point where it takes longer to download, verify, and propagate a block than it does to mine a new block (the block time). 
If it was as simple as just lowering the target block time, please explain why we even have a block time, and we don't just process each transaction immediately? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:41:02

This is simply untrue. Bitcoin is not a payment platform. The difference between your 1994 example and bitcoin is that one was a method of transmittance for an asset, the other *is* the asset with a method of transmittance built in. Very few people spend bitcoin on anything. What gives bitcoin its value today is its fixed limit, and relative ease of transfer of value. But in terms of a payment method, it is absolutely abysmal in competing with other consumer level services. Bitcoin is rising in value because the world is awakening to the concept of only 21M units, and simultaneously economies are being manipulated with quantitative easing across the world, and bitcoin represents a way out of the current system. That's what give bitcoin value. Not some retailer accepting it for payment. 




Yes, 9% of all gold usage (60% of industrial usage) is for dentistry, because again, gold teeth are made of gold. It may as well be jewelry. And electronics usage of gold is reaching an all time low and will continue to rapidly decline as we move entirely digital and signal quality becomes less and less of an issue, and any transmittance lines exposed to the elements become fiber optics. The fact is, gold simply doesn't have a real industrial demand. Certainly not one that is inelastic to its price. 


Not sure your purpose here, you are really proving my point. People don't simply leave a store of value. The move from MySpace to Facebook required very little effort on the consumer side. It was an entirely asymmetric switch.  


False again. Bitcoin is stored at a random value, and as long as the properties of math remain true (they will) and the number 2^256 remains big (it is), it is astronomically superior to any other asset class in terms of safeguarding value from theft/inflation (sorry for the redundancy). Hundreds of millions of *application specific* integrated circuits aren't just going to vanish over night. Hundreds of thousands of jobs of people's livelihoods aren't just going to be erased. This isn't to say bitcoin can't/won't drop substantially in the short term, but it does most definitely mean that there is a bottom floor for value. Like it or not, we've entered a new age and bitcoin will always be around, retaining value. We are past that tipping point. 


I simply disagree. You can't just point to the unknown and use that as a valid argument. It doesn't mean one isn't there, but it isn't a substitute for logic. Until the status quo is disproved, it remains supreme. Bitcoin itself has disproved the idea that money needs to be backed by something/someone to retain value, which is why we have a new status quo. But you weren't trading all your fiat in in 2008 were you? Just because it's plausible for there to be a logical argument against it doesn't release you of the burden to present such an argument. 




Risk is an entirely relative construct. Things are more risky than others, especially with temporal constraints, but "bitcoin is risky" is unsubstantiated FUD which again is not a substitute for logic. "Bitcoin is volatile in relation to equity/other asset classes" is a provable statement and thus, if your goal is short term gains, then your "risk" is entirely correlated with that volatility. But to just say "bitcoin is risky", with no relational constraints to that statement is pure FUD, and unless you have found a sha256 collision, is entirely unsubstantiated. 






No, because again, risk is related to temporal constraints. It doesn't exist in a vacuum. I owe a payment on a mortgage every month, and there's nothing to say whether I will have the available cash to cover the mortgage. Then I lose my collateral and the mortgage money. 
If you give me a loan for $100K, at 10%, with no payments due until 20 years down the road, at which point the entire amount is due, I would most likely take that. Again, because risk is relative, and over the period of 20 years, assuming development continues at the rate it is going, the risk is probably the lowest of any asset class. Which is why I do in fact have much much more invested than others, because I have the ability to cover my short term liabilities, and understand the timeline of the investment.

Bitcoin with a different hashing algorithm, 4x as many coins and 1/4 the block time. All tradeoffs that effectively make it less secure but faster. Scaling block sizes will be a problem with the faster block times though.

If S2X moves forward with mining a block &gt;1MB, it would break consensus rules, and there would be a fork. If you split your coins, then yes, you could sell those coins individually. 
Splitting to coins involves moving the coins on each chain to different addresses, so that if a replay attack is attempted, the transaction from one chain is invalid on the other.

Sorry but a "loaf of bread" doesn't count as a valid inflation measure. The CPI has shown steady inflation, and we are about to see substantially more soon, which is why the FED is raising interest rates continuously. 
All the stimulus money went into the stock markets, so we haven't felt the affects (inflation is an affect of increased money supply and isn't immediate), but with the stock market hitting all time highs for months on end, and an 8 year bull market, expect for money to start exiting the market and prices to start rising substantially. Once a recession is triggered, the only hope to save us again will be another bailout, and another influx of trillions of dollars to the money supply, which will inevitably lead to more inflation over time.

Are you joking? I take it you've never run a business. I have. Guess who was taking out a loan in their own name, to meet payroll in 2008, so that my employees could continue to pay their mortgages, fees their families, and keep their lights on. Should I bill them for the interest? If we are sharing losses and profits? They had no risk. They show up, they get paid. I had all the risk. I get the reward from that risk. They can pony up a partner buy in if they want. Or better yet, why do they need me if they can just do it themselves? Why do we even have company owners?

You and I have $100k each. I put mine into 10 startup companies. You put yours into 10 startup companies. I vetted my companies and chose them based off of properties that I believe make them more efficient with my capital, and have a higher chance of success than the other 50 i turned down. You chose yours at random. 
Mine make me a profit. Yours do not. That profit, comes from the effort required to spend money in the right places. $100K given to a group of MIT grads is going to probably be more efficiently allocated than giving a high school kid with a dream $100k.

No, you simply don't understand how bitcoin works fundamentally. 
A reorg only works if all the blocks are valid blocks according to the consensus rules. 
You can make 5X longer of a chain, but if you go to push it to nodes, and it fails concensus rules (i.e. Spending coins that never existed, spending someone else's coins, creating new coins outside of the limit) then it doesn't cause a reorg. It is literally a separate chain, and again, you don't need 51% of the hash power to do that.

You're right it has a ways to go. In fact, it would probably involve a complete redesign from the ground up. Here's why:
**There will always be fees.** That's the price we pay to have a decentralized currency with a fixed limit. Someone has to pay the miners. If we aren't doing it, it comes from the block reward which halves every 4 years. What happens when it gets too small (it arguably is already) to be able to fund the mining operations? In fiat, there are no transaction fees. In Visa, the vendors pay your tax fees. 
**It will never be instant.** Bitcoin is effectively the entire world coming to agreement on who owns what. We target a time of about 10 minutes to allow txs to aggregate, and to send an update to everyone, where everyone individually checks and forwards. There is no central, "right" answer. In fact, there can be 2 right answers temporarily. This happens in the form of "orphaning" 3-4 times per week. If we retarget down from 10 minutes, this would increase. If we retarget down from 10 minutes *and* increase the block size it would increase even more. In fact, there's a block size limit based on hardware speeds, where even the fastest computers in the world would orphan at 10 minutes. The more orphans you get, the longer you have to wait. It's a net 0 game. That's how decentralized computing works. I can spend cash instantly. Visa is also instant because they assume the risk. 
**It will always be 100% traceable**. By the very nature of how a bitcoin transaction works, you point at when someone gave you money, called a **U**nspent **TX** **O**utput (UTXO) as an "input", and then create new UTXOs as your tx output. So if you send me money, I can track each and every point that money changed hands, all the way back to when it was created. If you receive it from a tainted address (say, idk a dark web site), I don't value your bitcoin as much, because there's risk in that for me. That's called lack of "Fungibility" and is a major concern for all currencies. There are people sitting in jail right now, for this exact reason because of the way bitcoin works. This will never change. Tell me, where was that $ in your wallet 2 people before you?
So ya. Bitcoin actually really really sucks as a cash replacement. In fact, as a consumer, it's much easier to just use traditional banking or payment apps like Venmo. 
But Bitcoin is an excellent, *decentralized value protocol* immune from inflation, censorship, and is permission-less, which makes it an incredible platform for which to build cash replacement apps on top of. Some of those will be for profit. Some will be open source. Some will be closed source but not for profit. But it doesn't matter because the base layer is open and permission-less and someone like you or me can make any replacement to any of those options with just a properly formatted transaction on the blockchain to settle all transactions.

No, imagine bitcoin like a an excel spreadsheet keeping track of everyone's accounts. Every 10 minutes, someone posts a group of transactions, and you change your spreadsheet accordingly. If everyone makes the same changes, they stay in sync. 
Then, someone decides to post a change that doesn't meet your rules for changing the spreadsheet. Maybe they want to give themselves more money. Maybe they want to change the difficulty. Who knows. All you know is it doesn't follow your rules, so you ignore it. 
Others may like the new rules though. You have one group of people, using one set of rules, another group using a different set. All the sudden, your spreadsheet starts looking different than the other one. At first by just a little, but over time it looks more and more different. Their changes to their spreadsheet don't affect your spreadsheet at all. But it's different. 
That's what a chain fork is. There are two chains. If you had an account on the chain before it forked, you have an account on both spreadsheets now, with the exact same amount, spendable in the exact same way, you just need to tell someone keeping track of the spreadsheet you want to spend from. 
Many people were buying up bitcoin, so that they could have more money before it split, and then they can turn around and sell the coins that they don't want, as well as coins that maybe they stretched a little to buy short term. 
The important thing to keep in mind though, is anyone can fork at any time, but it doesn't change your spreadsheet at all. In fact, bitcoin accidentally forks 3-4 times every week before it corrects itself. All you have to do is watch your own spreadsheet and change it according to blocks of transactions that follow the rules you want to follow.

Bitcoin the protocol, is a decentralized ledger, keeping track of little chunks of value, called "bitcoin". Basically, imagine an excel spreadsheet, with two columns: one with the "account number" one with the amount available to it. This is simplified of course, for purpose of illustration. 
Everyone has a copy of this spreadsheet. Whenever anyone wants to give you bitcoin in exchange for something, you simply have to check that they have enough to pay, and then let everyone else know to update their spreadsheets to move that value to your account.
The first problem is, how do we know that you are actually you, and that the account belongs to you? There's something in modern day cryptography called a private key, and you can electronically "sign" something, like a transaction with your private key, and with a series of math operations, and some other given data, anyone can mathematically prove that you are authorizing a transaction. So that's step one. With this, we can not only stop other people from spending your money, but we can prove that you authorized spending your money, preventing you from disputing it later. You never share your private key with anyone. 
The second problem is, how do we keep track of every transaction across the world? There's quite a lot. Banks use a centralized method, where they are the gate keepers, and all transactions clear through them. Bitcoin uses a decentralized method, which means that everyone needs to keep track of everything, and that can get complicated quickly. The solution, is to wait a certain time interval, and group transactions into a "block". Every 10 minutes on average, a new block is produced, which is effectively the newest "update" of the excel spreadsheet. You (your software) can take that block, and process each transaction individually, and by the time you are done, you can be sure you have an up to date version of the spreadsheet (just like if you follow a recipe exactly, you know you will end up with whatever it is you are cooking). 
The next problem we face, is how do we know which blocks are genuine, and which ones are just people trying to break the system/steal bitcoins/act badly? We do this, by everyone coming up with a set of rules, that every block needs to follow. We call these "consensus rules". Every time you get a block you (your software) check off a list of things that either make it a valid block, or a non valid block. 
Let's switch over to mining from here... I'm economically incentivized to mine, because of both the transaction fees and block reward. Bitcoin, has a controlled release rate, based off a mathematical formula, that based off the block height (basically, number of blocks since the beginning) of time, which is currently at 12.5 bitcoin, per block. Add in another bitcoin or so worth of fees, and by offering a valid block, I can get upwards of $50k every 10 minutes to simply offer valid blocks. 
The first thing nodes check for a valid block, is the block header. Basically a summary of the block. It contains a lot of information, including essentially a fingerprint of all transactions included, and a fingerprint of the previous block, which means that a block is only valid if it is working off the current state of the network (the previous block). It also includes a number called a "nonce". When a node checks a block, it "hashes" all the information in the block, and creates the "fingerprint" that would go into the next block. A hash is basically a mathematical function that will give drastically different results for slightly different inputs, but will give the same value over and over when given the same input. 
So the node (your software) checks the hash of the block and makes sure it is what it says it is, as well as that it has some predetermined amount of 0s to begin the number with. Because there is no pattern to hashing, the only way to get some amount of 0s to the left is by pure luck. You change the data slightly, and you get a drastically different hash output. So essentially, you change the nonce in the header, and hash it again. Check if it has x amount of 0s to the left. Repeat until you do. The block is not valid until you do. It's very very hard to find a nonce that will produce a block with x amount of 0s, but very easy to check, given that nonce... like winning the lottery. 
This little "game" does a few things. 1) it allows time to pass, and for transactions to add up. 2) it allows for somewhat of a "lottery" release of money, rather than to one special person/entity. 3) it secures the network from bad blocks. 
It secures the network, because every time I run a hash, I use some small amount of electricity. Electricity costs money. The more 0s required to the left, the more statistically improbable it is that I get one that meets the requirements, which means I need to run more hashes, which means more electricity, which means it costs me more money. Eventually, it becomes economically more worth it to me, to play with the network and win the $50k+ reward, than it does to try and cheat the network. 
This compounds even more, when there's more competition. Lots of people want to win the block game. So lots of people will invest in faster and faster hardware, and eventually, it becomes such a substantial amount of money worth of hardware to beat everyone else competing, that again, its more worth it to just play along rather than try and destroy it. About every 2 weeks, the difficulty readjusts, recalibrating the time between blocks to be about 10 minutes (upping the amount of 0s needed on the left, decreasing the chances of getting one). So even if I did get maximum hashing power, it would relevel out within 2 weeks. 
Let's say I'm a determined bad actor though, with lots of money to spend. Not unlike a malicious government. Let's say I get enough power and hardware to regularly produce blocks that satisfy the 0s requirement. Well, that's just the first thing that gets checked. We also check how much you pay yourself for a reward. If my rules say the reward is 12.5 for the current block, and you give yourself 20, your block is invalid. Now you spend all the time and money and electricity, just to make a block that I take one look at and say no to. Let's say you try to spend some coins from an account that isn't yours, or some coins you don't have.... if you don't have the private key, you can't sign such a transaction, and because I have a full copy of the blockchain I can check each transaction individually and prove it good or bad. If your block includes a single bad transaction, it's not a valid block. Again, immediately rejected, I don't care how much you spent on it. 
There's a lot of little rules that a block has to conform to, and they all amount to making it cost a lot of money to produce one, and making it more beneficial to act in synch with everyone else, than against them. 
Also, side note, this is also how we can ensure only 21M will be created, because at certain block heights, new rewards are set. It started at 50BTC per block, then went to 25, now it's 12.5, and in about 3 years it will be 6.25, 4 years later 3.125, all the way down until there's a maximum of just less than 21M coins. If a block tries to cheat, or keeps adding a reward, it won't be a valid block. Eventually fees will play more of a roll than the block reward, until around 2140 when the last coins are minted, it's basically all fees as  the reward. 
So, very long story short, mining is the grouping/verifying of transactions, and then the repeated hashing of that block of transactions, to get a result that proves that I have statistically spend a lot of money creating, and thus the network will give my block a chance to pass the rest of consensus rules, and possibly be the newest update to the spreadsheet of transactions (with the reward of course).

Can you really hold someone to a claim that we would have larger blocks, when Segwit wasn't even activated by then?
And we *do* have larger blocks, and blocks *can* get up to almost 4MB so there is nothing disingenuous about it. I'm sorry if the facts aren't convenient, however, Segwit is a block size increase, that when wallets allow for users to create Segwit transactions, *will* result in 2MB blocks. It is not Segwit that is failing to meet its claims here.

You may not be an American, but you sure do [support Bernie](


Yes, because [bad money drives out good money]( As it currently is in India, Venezuela, and across the world. Its only a matter of time. All fiat currencies go to zero.


The IMF was the one *who advocated for such QE and easy debt*. Of course they think we fucked up. *THEY ARE THE ONES TO BLAME*. Irrelevant now that there's hard money available. Oh, and I have student loans, but I also got a real degree, and have no problem paying the load off. Liberal Arts majors should be mandated to take at least one finance/accounting class their first semester and understand [financial leverage]( before continuing. You can't blame a free market for people being stupid. Please, tell me more about how the free market forced these people to take on loans by putting a gun to their head.


Ya I don't ever recall saying that. What I did say, was that they traded what was given to them. And what was given to them, were terribly rated bonds of loans, being rated as AAA when they were a C at best *because the federal government was saying they insured all of them*. That's called fraud. That's illegal... Unless you are the gov't of course.


Hmmmm, sounds great. Maybe *the government should get right on charging those who committed actual fraud*. Otherwise, if you have even a penny in a retirement fund, *you also traded the bonds*. That doesn't make you a criminal. You (the person delegated to trade for you) were simply trading off the face value of it. Thank the government that the face value was not correct.


["***Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were two government-sponsored enterprises (GSE)*** that bought mortgages from banks, a process known as buying on the secondary market.](
[***They packaged these into mortgage-backed securities, and resell them to investors on Wall Street.*** The entire financial system is built on trust. That trust was shaken by the Subprime Mortgage Crisis."](
Fraud. Please, put them in jail. How you can blame the "free market" on this is beyond me. That's the furthest thing from free.


When are unions bad? Unions are part of a free market. Government mandated minimum wage is bad. Government Unions are bad because there is no collective bargaining at that point, they simply can't get fired. But there's a reason private sector unions voted primarily for Trump.


Haha ok, ad hominem at its worst. No logic. Wouldn't expect anything less from a socialist. 


Yes, yes he was. Because Karl did absolutely nothing except for lecture on an economic structure *that throughout history has failed again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and will continue to fail.* Just because someone says something, doesn't make it true. You need to get with objective reality. I don't see Karl winning any prizes or doing anything spectacular.


No, because we don't have a free market right now, so to point to today's market and say "see the free market doesn't work" would be akin to putting a stick in your bicycle spokes and saying it was the bike that caused you to fall. The market is rigged by bullshit like minimum wage and a 13000 page tax code designed to benefit those with high paid lawyers and accountants, but ironically, if we try and simplify things the left screams that we "are hurting the middle class" because we are removing tax write offs that are there to "promote equality" but non of them have any idea even exist. You want to fix tax loopholes. Ok, the tax code should be 3 pages max.


And if you try to put Venezuela as a childish argument again bad bad socialism, I'll just leave Somalia there.
Venezuela's entire economy was socialism, paid for by oil. All that shit Bernie wants, "free healthcare, free college, free blowjobs, free everything" isn't free, it has to come from someone giving up their own resources. Venezuela paid for it using oil. When oil inevitably tanked, so did all the funding for their healthcare, electricity, etc, etc. It was only a matter of time. So if you want to run a similar system, where everything is paid for the rich, all it would take would be a market downturn for the entire system to crumble. No thanks.


Lol, Anarchy and Libertarianism are 100% different things, but sure. Demonstrate your lack of understanding basic governmental structures. Its about equivalent to saying just because you have a small penis, we can assume that you *have no penis*. See how that doesn't add up?


Lol, again, you can quote idiots all day and night, if they don't do anything demonstrably productive, or prove it objectively, it doesn't make them right.

Because signatures take up a disproportionate amount of block space. Scaling is much more complicated than a linear expansion. There's a reason why websites run into issues they didn't run into before when they grow by an order of magnitude.
For example, I give you some sticks and tell you to build a house. If it's a small enough house, you can build whatever.

Bitcoin is doing exactly what it was designed to do, and has done as such for almost a decade now. Meanwhile, (let me guess you’re an ethereum fan boy) ethereum is less than half its age and has already had to give up its claim to immutability. How many multiple million dollar hacks have happened in the past 2 years? Not looking too good from a resiliency standpoint. 


Yes, hence why I sold a very substantial amount in early December for this to all blow over. Fun fact, BIPs were highest for bitcoin during the exact same period of the largest price decline. Price isn’t everything. 


First off, to pretend like the hack job ethereum has proven to be is “the better product” is laughable at best. It is interesting in terms of what they are trying to accomplish, and can boys like you hyping it up make me richer by the day, but your hype isn’t sustainable. In the end, it’s still an autistic, socially inept kid with a massively inflated head, promising the world and delivering very little of it, almost always late and with bugs. I know, because I own a substantial amount that I’ve basically written off as a gamble in a startup. 
Secondly, there’s absolutely no data to make such an absurd claim. In fact, history pretty much always shows that the product that the porn/sex industry grasps onto first will win out. Sex sells. “Accepting Bitcoin” carries more weight to the general population than “accepting ether” does. Not to mention, having a currency that won’t even be on par with the laughably pathetic central reserve’s goal of 2% inflation for *40 fucking years* isn’t exactly a great selling point. Ether is a bunch of get rich quick kids. I’m glad I got in before the mass of you fools, because you have made me a lot of money with your incompetence and exuberance. Thanks. 


No argument here. I’m to the point where it feels like I’m cheating at life with the amount of money I still have in, after cashing out more than I ever expected to. I would be much better off it “the flippening” actually occurred, but I don’t let my hopes and dreams drive my investment decisions. I’ll wait for the ether bubble to burn out and sell near its top too, and buy it all back down at the floor in a few months.

"Social" != "socialist"
Socialism has a particular economic definition where the means of production are owned by society as a whole, and the only way such a system is viable is if you have a centrally planned economy. 
You can have social programs and a safety net, and it is still not socialism. 
The Nordic countries have very very free markets which allows for their system to run very efficiently, so people can afford higher taxes. In the US, there's ridiculous laws for everything, where it feels like if you take your morning shit after 9:03am you are taxed at a higher rate than if you take it between 9:01 and 9:03, but you'd never know because it's buried in a 13k page tax code that changes yearly. Minimum wage makes wages lower than collective bargaining would. All of these little rules and regulations make it impossible to compete with large corporations with salaried lawyers and accountants to know all the little loopholes. 
Socialists point to regulations as if they are the savior, but really, its regulations that got us where we are today. On the contrary, the Nordic countries just have extremely free and open economies, making them more efficient, so everyone doesn't mind paying an extra 5% in taxes to cover welfare expenses.

FinCEN which is a division of the ~~FBI~~ Treasury. 
These companies register as money service businesses (MSBs), which is a step below legal status of a bank. Companies are required to come up with their own AML/KYC program, under threat that if there is ever a case where the FBI would want to investigate a transaction, you'd better be able to give them some valuable information or be held liable.

You have it backwards. By not tightening the money supply, there’s the risk of a currency crisis.

As all the money starts to drain off the stock market from profits, it will enter the consumer sector and CPI will rise. The money is already out there. Without QT, CPI will go through the roof. 
And you don’t seem to understand, they literally are in QT right now. It’s not about starting it. They already are.

But it doesn't last forever, and you can pull out without a POWC. If you deny that plausibility, you are denying a fundamental fact. It has nothing to do with what *would* happen (obviously POW).

Not sure what you mean by this. If you are referring to bitcoin dust, UTXOs can be combined back up to any size quite easily. The UTXO set grows and shrinks. If you're referring to some sort of physical key, a private key is a number. Just like 105 is a number. There is a bitcoin address associated with the key with the integer value "105". 


It has nothing to do with being able to create gold. It has everything to do with us not knowing how much total supply there is. And evidence supports that in our solar system, it's not very scarce. 


Again, you can't crack it. It's not going to happen. Math. 


You don't have to be "fully converted", because math doesn't depend on you or I. Unless you can find a way to fit more integers in between the set of all real numbers 0-21e6, bitcoin will remain valuable.  Just like 2+2 doesn't care what you think about it, bitcoin doesn't care what you think about it. It just is.

I know where you are getting, and sure my semantics probably aren't up to par, but the point I'm trying to make is that in order to know the complete state of the bitcoin network (it is a consensus mechanism of UTXO states after all), the excess block information is needed. Therefore, it is a block size increase. More data is included with each block, if your node is trying to act as a full node, in the traditional sense of a full node.

I would hardly call bitcoin Core an "organization". That's like calling something like "feeding the homeless" an organization. 
Bitcoin Core is an open project, that sure, organizations can contribute to, but ultimately no one is really in charge of. Some individuals carry more weight than others because they have proven more useful over time (Maxwell has many many more commits than my 0, thus it would make more sense to take his word over mine). However, if I come with a valid idea, and have the sound backing to argue it effectively, it will be implemented, even if it means forking away from the original project on Github.
"Core" is just like "bitcoin" (lowercase b) where I think it is separate from the actual project page/protocol. If all miners started mining a chain with unlimited inflation, and it had the longest POW, does that mean it is bitcoin? I don't think so. We could easily just fork, POWC, and carry on, keeping balances the same as the block where the miners decided to fork off, and even with a lesser POW, it would still be "bitcoin" in the market's eyes. That's all that matters. 
If the maintainers of the "Core" project on Github become corrupt, it's entirely possible for the rest of the 90+ other active developers to just form the code base and continue on. In my eyes, the new fork would be "Core".

Warren Buffet recommends you “hold” (because he can spell and doesn’t take investment advice from a meme), cash flow generating assets, because market fundamentals tell us that as long as people are doing productive things, wealth will continue to be created and by holding equity and in taking cash distributions, your wealth grows as well. 
Commodity investing is not the same at all as equity investing. Your commodity isn’t doing anything productive, except for providing a supply for where there is demand. In early December, there was a very high demand for bitcoin. That’s where you normalize your portfolio, and reallocate taking profits. Commodities are there to hedge against economic fluctuations. Not to be a continuous return on investment at all times. 
If you are watching the commodity value of your portfolio grow, and aren’t doing anything about it, you may as well not even own that commodity, because that demand isn’t going to last forever.

The realistic amount of transactions will go up to about 2MB, but yes under optimal conditions it can reach almost 4MB. 
Still, it's entirely false to paint Segwit as *not* a block size increase, because of the fact that a 2MB block, nevermind a 4MB block, would be valid.
Until you can explain how we can fit &gt;1MB worth of data into a block, yet still only transmit 1MB of data and encapsulate all transaction information, you can't claim that Segwit *wasn't* a block size increase. Because it is demonstrably, increasing the size of blocks propagated across the network. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:35:45


Your logic here is circular. Of course bitcoin can have inherent value. You can not send me bitcoin, unless you somehow acquire bitcoin first. So as long as you can't just magically make bitcoin, outside of the consensus rules, it has scarcity. And being that it's mathematically limited scarcity makes it more absolutely scarce than literally anything on the planet, *people will value it* due to the scarcity. You are looking at it in reverse. People are valuing the scarcity. 


Again, never said it couldn't drop in value in the short term, and *you can't simply point to the unknown as a valid argument against it*. You need to point to a specific example, otherwise, there's no rational reason to worry about it. Unknown is not a substitute for logic. By that thought, all religions can be proved real, because you can't prove them untrue without knowing. But in doing so, because all religions claim to be the only true religion, they would all disprove themselves. It simply breaks down. Unknowns are not replacements for logic. 


Something something unsubstantiated FUD, unknowns, and "risk" with no relative gauge point. 


No, the demand is tied to your ability to absolutely park what is now universally becoming a specific segment of value, onto a random number in such a way that it is impossible to have it stolen from you. Your argument that gold has a baseline demand is what is giving it value is pointless. Sand has a baseline demand. Should we start storing value in sand?


"Bitcoin is more risky on a short term basis than fiat". Sure. I would agree with such a statement. Thank you for applying constraints. Bitcoin is a terrible replacement for cash at the moment, so keeping any amount of value in it expecting it to be immediately liquid would be stupid. That isn't the argument. Stocks are riskier than bonds. Does that mean we paint the entire stock market as "risky"? No because it's even more risky, over a long enough time period to store your money in bonds, while the market and inflation zoom past you. Ask anyone on a fixed income. Again, "risk" means nothing in a vacuum. 


Ok bud. I'm tired of beating a dead horse. Risk is relative. Bottom line. Risk doesn't exist in a vacuum. 


Ummm, ya that's not your point, because your point implied short term constraints, which obviously bitcoin is not conducive to at the moment. But does that make bitcoin comparable on the risk scale to going to a casino and putting money on red or black? Again, something something risk is relative. I will bet you $1 every single day that bitcoin will be worth more than $2000 tomorrow. Willing to take that bet? Why not? If bitcoin is "risky" without any relative constraints, and gambling is "risky" without any constraints, wouldn't that mean it's a safe bet? Something something risk is relative. 


Yes you did. Bitcoin is "risky". In relation to what? Red or black? No. Cash? Short term or long term? If you aren't going to give any constraints, we can assume you have none, and you are saying it is as "risky" as literally anything else. In other words, it's relative risk to everything, it is "riskier". If you have no baseline, other than "it is risky" then your base case for the argument is that losing everything is always imminent in nature. I would argue it's the exact opposite for bitcoin. 


Again, you can't point to the unknown as a case against something. You have no reason to believe development would cease, so any decision you make based off of it ceasing would be irrational. It's certainly plausible that an alien species comes into our world tomorrow, turns us into slaves and kills the entire development team using their domesticated velociraptors, but it is highly unlikely. Something something risk is relative. 
Bottom line, you have done absolutely nothing to point to a valid/logical reason as to why bitcoin would crumble, other than point to the unknown, which is a fallacy, and directly supports my original claim. The plausibility of such a replacement should be considered any more of a risk than alien species wiping us all out with domesticated velociraptors, because there's absolutely no evidence of this happening, and is irrational.

Ethereum uses an entirely different base consensus mechanism called GHOST and needs many more transaction confirmations than bitcoin/Litecoin. 
Again, if we could, we would process each transaction as needed. 
Litecoin works without full blocks, at 2.5 minutes. But can you say for sure that orphaning doesn't increase substantially when block sizes increase? How do you plan to scale the base block size when it gets to that point? You have to process transactions 4x faster than bitcoin for the same block sizes. Sure not a problem &lt;1MB, but again, no one cares about/uses Litecoin, so it's not really a problem. Dogecoin has fast cheap transactions too. So does peer coin.

Not only that, but multisignature operations scale quadratically. Segwit brought it from O(n^2 ) down to O(n). The next step is to simply shrink the size of each element, and finally, looking to find a long term viable O(log(n)) scheme. Then, increasing block size is a trivial argument because each linear increase in size can handle an exponential amount of transactions. 
Before, an exponential increase in block size would result in a linear increase of transaction throughout.
But leave it to simple minds to go with the first solution that comes to mind. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:33:44
There's really no reason to believe that blocks will remain 1MB forever. 
The resource usage of a full node is a valid concern, especially when a primary objective  of bitcoin is to be/remain decentralized. Increasing block sizes increases node resources required, and in doing so, leads to some level of centralization. *How much*, and if that level is acceptable is debatable, *but not if*. So when given two options of scaling, Segwit and block size increase, it makes sense to go with the objectively better option with regards to centralization. 
Since it's very clear now that the recent backlog "crisis" was really just entities effectively running a DDoS attack, and the blocks have plenty of room now that those attacks have stopped, even without Segwit enabled addresses, there is no technical reason to increase the base block size. As RAM and internet infrastructure/bandwidth become more ubiquitous, there's really no reason to hold the blocks small. But you can't tell me, if in 2020, raspberri pis have 16GB of ram, and everyone has a 5G internet connection, that the Core project would keep a 1MB block size.
People mistake "Core" as if it is some sort of corporation/organization charged with maintaining bitcoin. It isn't. Core is a Github project, and while yes, there is a meritocracy in deciding pull requests, the people in charge right have have demonstrated far superior merit than anyone who criticizes them. Segwit solved many different technical issues, including quadratic scaling and transaction malleability, and in doing so, has opened the floodgates on possible development opportunities both on and off chain. BCH, if it lasts long enough, will eventually hit full blocks in the future, and will need to linearly scale again. Meanwhile, multisig operations scale quadratically, and they will find themselves scaling larger and larger until not even data center level nodes can keep up. Scaling is more than a linear problem. 
The same individuals who brought Segwit, also are currently implementing LN, schnorr signatures, Bech32 address encoding, and many other features that have/will pave the way to a ubiquitous bitcoin future. If that isn't merit, especially in comparison to someone kicking and screaming about some unfounded conspiracy, and confusing basic moderation for censorship, then idk what is. 
And let's play the safe card and assume the S2X charges are all real, and there's some super duper uber secret conspiracy to keep blocks small forever and ever, by like 5/100+ devs who are funded by a private company. Being a meritocracy, it can be fairly easy for the other 90+ active developers to overrule, any gate keeping techniques, or simply fork off and leave the bad actors high and dry. Being a meritocracy, it is quite easy to persuade other developers on your project that someone is acting counter to merit, especially if someone can clearly demonstrate larger blocks running on what most would consider minimal hardware. 
So tl;dr, there's absolutely no reason to fear that blocks will remain small forever, when the past 30 years have shown us that hardware capabilities increase exponentially. But right now, the equivalent of the internet is being built on the equivalent of phone line infrastructure, and until we turn the corner to allow for P2P data transfer and validation speeds to increase dramatically, it makes far more sense to air on the side of caution and not objectively centralize a decentralized consensus network. Especially when blocks aren't even full at the moment, and there's now relief room, on chain, in the form of Segwit.
Edit: also, just to add, there's currently a [wish list]( of items that need a hard fork to actually implement, that if a hard fork for any/all of those items was proposed, you can bet your ass if a block size increase is not included, and hardware infrastructure can handle it, there's going to be someone forking the proposed code and increasing the block size. At that point, even I as a small blocker would be on board for a small bump in base capacity.

There's better explanations on YouTube. Some are dated, so if it mentions decreasing the time lock by a day every transaction, that doesn't apply anymore. Better yet, if you don't care about how it works behind the scenes, there's plenty of experimental videos showing it happening on a test net. Basically, imagine bitcoin but instant and free. It effectively builds a layer on top of bitcoin, like how your debit card is a layer on top of ACH. 
Basically, Segwit was required for this to work, because it fixed something called "transaction malleability" that allowed for the miners to slightly modify a portion of the transaction, completely changing the tx hash. So if I open a channel with you, thinking it is one tx hash, and 3 months down the road it turns out it's a different tx hash, that causes problems. Now that we have fixed that, LN and many many other things are possible. LN is just one scaling solution. I have a feeling we will be scaling/sending money in the future in ways that we can't even imagine today. Sort of how live streaming on Facebook wouldn't have been comprehensible back in 1994.

Again, we agree to disagree. Run your own code, not my problem. But if you expect my value to follow, it's not going to. 


Yes it is. Because if we aren't sure something is something, then selling it as if you are sure is fraudulent. Best case scenario you can sell it as "new and improved bitcoin". But to sell it like it "is" the existing ledger (that's what you are buying when you buy bitcoin) is a blatent fucking lie and you know it. 


Without viable replay protection, no one is going to dump the coins. And again, I'll give up the bitcoin name if there's clear market support. I think at best we see it hold steady, more likely it falls below 60% of the price before it becomes viable to split and sell and it dies off. But to just mark it as "the most hashrate" is stupid, especially, when all other available metrics beyond hash power show that people are more interested in dumping it than actually using it. Again, my interest is in the most interesting, most potential showing coin which is by far the coin that Core's software follows. Strip away the name, make it POWC, doesn't matter. Because it wasn't the name or hashrate that got us to where we are today. It was development work. All a hijacking would do is send it back into the shadows. It doesn't stop *the real bitcoin* (or whatever we want to call it) at all. If anything, it removes the spotlight. And when it inevitably scales much better long term due to orders of magnitude better development, everyone is going to be shocked and horrified to find that it's been chugging along ever since the genesis block. You can't kill bitcoin.  


No it isn't. It's a completely different ledger. That makes it a completely different system. Sorry. 


S2X *is the other chain*. It didn't exist, and will soon coexist. BTC is just moving along. It's a malicious strategy to invoke confusion. But hey, all is fair in a free market. Unfortunately for them, the businesses they are trying to recruit exist under regulated markets. 


Selling something as something it isn't is fraudulent. Plain and simple. Selling the S2X ledger like it is the existing ledger, is by definition fraud. That's not based on "how I feel" that's just based on a pretty simple bit of logic. 


I'm not talking about the size of the block, I'm talking about the lack of valid development support. BTC1 has absolutely 0 respected developers, failed to even correctly implement a block size increase until luke-jr did it for them, and has done a laughably awful job at keeping up with bug fixes. Let's say S2X goes according to plan. Everything switched over, it's assumed to be the real "bitcoin"... now what? You think the developers on Core just slide on over? Lol. No. BTC1 will inevitably stall and or fail to keep up with the innovation that will continue on the core chain. Eventually, maybe even a few months down the road, the core chain will again be "bitcoin" and now Coinbase and all the other exchanges that prematurely named a winner will have a lot of lawsuits for selling "bitcoin" that is fundamentally incompatible with "actual bitcoin". That will be a sight to see.

Segwit segregates the witness script portion of a transaction from the past of the block with the limit. Doing such, reduces the overall "weight" of the transaction, and you can fit more transactions within the same limit. So, if demand stays the same, and supply (block space) increases, the price of a transaction (fee) will decrease. This was done using a "soft fork", which is essentially a tightening of the consensus rules. Along with this primary change, it also includes many other cool Easter eggs, particularly fixing transaction malleability, which allows for off chain scaling, and some nifty versioning, which makes features much easier to implement in the future. 
Segwit 2X tries to expand on that by increasing the block limit, which requires a "hard fork"which is a fundamental change in the consensus rules. The problem most people have with it, is that it is a half baked solution, rushed, with very little competent development support, if any at all. Given that hard forks are hard to pull off, the general consensus is that you should pack as many features into one as possible. There's quite a few things on the bitcoin development wish list that could be included in a timely hard fork, but would be impossible to include on the 2X timeline. Much of the core development individuals that brought Segwit has an official statement of "LOL" in regards to 2X, and as such, the first implementation of the 2X code didn't even correctly increase the block size. 
Finally, from a purely resource oriented standpoint, there's research to support that the upper limit of most current nodes on the network can only support 4MB blocks (which is the current upper limit of possible Segwit blocks right now. If the base block size is doubled, Segwit could possibly mean 8MB blocks, which would kill off a substantial portion of nodes. If you can't run a full node, you have no choice but to run an SPV node and depend on someone else's full node to tell you the truth which contradicts bitcoin's purpose for a lot of people. 
Most people agree that *eventually*, as hardware infrastructure allows/develops, base block size should increase. They just think that it should be a well thought out, well planned, hard fork, that doesn't diminish the ability for someone to choose to run a node/centralize transaction validation.

Well it depends on why you want to "invest" to begin with. 
Typically, smart investing requires an extensive analysis on whatever it is that you are interested, followed by the realization that the asset you are interested is undervalued, and through market forces, will correct to its market value, or offer some other incentive (dividends, etc).
Since bitcoin has no dividends (it's a pure asset, not ownership in a productive company expecting cash inflow), if you are buying bitcoin, you are expecting for it to increase in value. Again, you should probably have sound reasoning for that. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. If you think that demand for bitcoin will increase because of ease of use, store of value properties, inflation hedging properties, etc, etc, then because supply is known and fixed for any period of time, you can easily see that price will rise with that demand. If you want to "invest in bitcoin" just because you "think it will go up", then you do not have a firm enough understanding of what you are buying and should tread extremely lightly. 
On the other hand if you think demand for bitcoin will not increase, and you have a valid reasoning for that (security concerns, governmental interference, etc, etc) then it would make sense to not only not invest, but to take a short position. 
I look at the amount of innovation and development in this space, combined with the fuckery of central banks, along with the underutilization of bitcoin at the moment, and don't see how demand could decrease, and should increase substantially. So with that in mind, I'm long. If you disagree with any of my reasoning, then you should be short.

Uhm, no


Exactly. If your node is validating a transaction, *it is being economically active*. If you just have a node running, *it doesn't do anything*. ***It is irrelevant***.


You are preaching to the choir buddy. But running multiple nodes just to run nodes is simply a [Sybil attack.]( The only reason to run a node, is to know the current UTXO set, so that you can draft valid transactions. If you just want a copy of the blockchain, it is available on any torrent site.


I can have 1000 nodes, all in consensus with each other, but if I'm the only one using the nodes, *it doesn't matter, because it is economically irrelevant*. ["Consensus"]( in a computer science discussion carries a much more specific meaning than it does in plain english. They can have 100 blocks of their own forked currency, and it can be spendable, *on their own fork*. Computers are coming to a consensus about the state of the UTXO set. That's it. There's no such thing as a "chain with more consensus". If there are two chains, then each chain has a set of nodes in a state of 100% consensus with each other. But if the chains are not the same, then those nodes are 0% in consensus with the nodes on the other chain.


I'm very scared for the world if you are a bitcoin consultant. Businesses should most definitely run a node. Anyone regularly accepting transactions should run a node. Otherwise they are trusting another node to give them the UTXO set, not to mention, opening the door for a statistical analysis on the SPV traffic, obliterating their privacy.


If you accept transactions, run a node. If you are just hodling, you don't need to run a node. You are literally just wasting electricity. But not needing to run a node, and not *being able to run a node* are two different things. Anyone should be able to cheaply and easily run a node. But just running a node to run one is stupid.

Again, citation needed that Segwit didn't have majority support. Just because it was implemented through a mining consensus mechanism doesn't mean that users didn't support it. The fact that a large enough constituency was able to force the miners hands through UASF is reason enough to believe that Segwit was popular amongst users. I don't see any general consensus amongst users that they actually want 2X.

It's more akin to getting fucked over by ISPs. 
Sure the free market tells you to go choose a different provider. Realistically, with such high barriers to entry (both market barriers and government barriers) it's effectively impossible to not get fucked. 
If S2X succeeds, it's because a substantial amount of the end user services can single handedly push the narrative that the new coin is "bitcoin" and realistically, no one can do anything about it. It's a hijacking. Plain and simple. They have openly said the purpose of the fork is to "fire core". It has nothing to do with a compromise solution. They didn't even increase the block size correctly until a Core dev went to fix it for them.
So in that regard, if bitcoin can be hijacked so simply, it really makes no sense to continue developing for it, because it has failed. Likely, they would continue to develop on the core chain, and there would need to be different user services that cater to that chain. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:15:25
Again false. Just because the chain isn't progressing quickly doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and eventually miners will get greedy enough to dedicate enough resources to it to get to the difficulty readjustment point. 
Once again, if the block doesn't meet consensus rules, they are forking. Most end user "features" (21M coin limit, not spendable without private keys, etc) are all protected by your own node's consensus rules, not mining hashing power. The only thing hashing power does is reduce the incentive to broadcast bad blocks. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:52:48
Clearly you didn't pass 1st grade math so, here's a basic refresher on how percentages work:
As you can see, a percentage is a portion of something. If you have *all of something*, you have 100%. If you have half of something, you have 50%. If you have none of something, you have 0%. *Cue Count laugh*. 
So if one group, gets 51% of the hash power and changes a consensus rule, they are mining on a completely new chain. They would need to dedicate a *portion of their hashing power* (i.e. Part of their 51%) to keeping that chain moving. Also, they would need to severely decrease their own chains difficulty if they plan on running it, because they are running *with even LESS* hashing power than the original chain. The original chain has 49%, the attacker has a portion of 51%. 
Further more, now, the attacker no longer has 51% of the hash power, so a reorg/DoS attack isn't possible. Remember 50% of 51% is &lt; 49%. Oh ya, forgot you didn't pass first grade math, that's the symbol for "less than"... just treat it like a hungry alligator. 
So, in order to both control a hard fork (consensus rule changes can only happen with a hard fork), AND control 51% of the hash power in the original chain, they would need a whopping 102% of hash power. Considering you already learned from the Count today that "all" is 100%, I would really hope you see how you look like Forrest Gump in this conversation, thinking that a 51% attack can result in consensus rule changes.

That's what a market economy is. You don't have to participate unless you want to. But why would anyone want to clean up people's shit voluntarily with nothing in return? You still haven't answered that question beyond some hand wavy bullshit about how it would be "satisfying" to someone. 
The reason we can delegate tasks, and specialize economically (for example, in a mechanical engineer, so I spend my time with math and analysis software, so that I don't have to raise chickens or bring my trash to a landfill) is because we can offer something of value to do as such. Are you saying that if we got rid of money, you would be willing to come take my trash away because it would make you "feel good"?! Lol. The only reason I can have someone do it today is because I pay a company to come out and do it for me, hence offer an incentive to do it beyond "satisfaction". 
If you can't comprehend that basic concept, then you are living in a fantasy world.

That's not what you said, but sure. You were insinuating that the reason blocks aren't larger is because there's a race. The validation time is minimal in a miner's decision to include a transaction in a block. And a block must be complete *before* they can start hashing it. They aren't hashing it and adding transactions simultaneously because that would change the hash. The only thing that changes is the nonce.  
The point being is that security/stability decreases as block time reaches zero.

Park bitcoins in a payment channel. No counterparty risk, you can remove coins at anytime permissonlessly. 
You can make as many off chain transactions as you want, instantly, and freely, back and forth with the other person in the channel. Whenever someone wants to close the channel, they just publish the latest signed transaction. All those off chain transactions end up equating to a single "parking" transaction, and a single closing "net" transaction, with the final balance. 
Now, if I connect to you, and Alice connects to you, then theoretically, I can pay you, and you can pay Alice all off chain, and all cryptographically provable. Combine this idea with 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon and you can effectively park your coins with a hub, and pay just about anyone else. Some hubs will be free in exchange for your privacy. Some will take a percentage. Some will be subscription based. Some will charge per transaction. Who knows. It's a free market.

First off, that was never my claim, I claimed that *any* block size increase leads to centralization. Which is true. [Bitfury]( did a study in 2016 on the affects of blocksize on nodes, and found RAM to be a severely limiting factor. You can't argue that block size increases have no affect on hardware ability. You *can* argue that the centralization will be negligible. If someone's PII node running on a solar panel falls off, we can both agree that it is not going to have an affect on the aggregate network. But to claim that it isn't centralization is flat wrong. By removing the ability for that person to run a node, you are centralizing the network. 


Talk about citation needed. The vast majority of bitcoin transactions are trading/speculation related. The fact is, transactions are clearing with little to no fee. A block size increase won't change that.
Also, that's entirely beside the point that an on chain transaction is an awful substitute for cash. Transactions will always need confirmation time, will be 100% traceable, and will always have a fee. Bitcoin functions much better as a settlement layer than a cash substitute. 


Fixed it before you posted your reply. Give me a break, I'm on my phone. 


Again, citation needed. That's false. The assumption has always been that there would never be 100% adoption. You can't be absolute on anything, why would Segwit be any different. 


Again, may I remind you, there's plenty of capacity left at the moment. 


A rushed hardfork by subpar developer(s?) is a terrible option. Again, there's capacity right now. I don't see the problem. 


Again, I don't disagree. I disagree that November should be the "when". Propose a hard fork with more than one of [these]( and I'm on board. Most of Core would be too. 


You seem to be on the same page, but have some sort of FUD that this is somehow an emergency issue. Tragedy of the commons shows that any free public asset will be abused. The only effective way of avoiding that is a market. Because that goes substantially beyond basic level use cases, it makes a lot more sense to develop cash replacement layers on top of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a value transfer protocol. Regardless what it's initial intent was, that's its killer app. Just like the microwave was a world changing invention, originally intended for a different purpose.

It doesn't, someone is basically getting fucked by making a terrible market decision, usually under false assumptions or being mislead by propaganda that they aren't alone. 
A market simply matches buys and sellers. If most people don't know about coin XYZ, and they don't try to sell it, the supply available for sale is small. If I go to sell mine for $500, and someone decides that they want to buy it for $500, that's their own prerogative. They will have a very hard time getting rid of it because the amount of willing buys is small, and a node following the original chain won't see it as valid, but from the market's standpoint, that someone assigned $500 of value to that coin, whether it's actually worth it in the rest of the market's eyes or not. 
Lost of people got burned in the BCH game, they just don't know it yet. The same will happen with the rest of these forks. 
The market value is just a visualization construct that we make up, by multiplying total issued amount x current market price.

The other way around. All private keys are generated from a main private key and a chain code, which is effectively a predetermined pattern. 
So using one root private key (in most cases a 12-24 word seed), each and every child private key can be determined by just using the predetermined pattern, and something like each private key can have like 2 million children. So he can effectively have a single private key, and many many many different addresses on that single key.

So in other words, use the distribution formula, at current block height, and that's how many are considered "in circulation" including lost coins. 
The reason we don't have an equivalent for fiat, is because based on fractional reserve lending, $1 of federal reserve debt can literally be thousands of $ worth of currency "in circulation" through other debts.

"The poster" was me. I was using a metaphor. I don't understand how you can't see that. 
There's a $71B bounty to find a vulnerability, and it rises every day. 8 years now without one.
"The blockchain" isn't some mysterious thing. It's a network state. Like if you initialize variables in a program. Or like the state of the food in your refrigerator. In order to change, something needs to happen. In bitcoin, that's the encumbrance script being solved in a transaction, which in a P2PK transaction, requires a private key. If bitcoin's private key encryption is broken, There's going to be a lot more turmoil than just bitcoin crashing, considering it is the same encryption that guards nation secrets. In reality, we just fork with a new encryption and carry on. Nbd.  
If you don't know my 256 bit private key (and mathematically, it's impossible for you to guess), you aren't spending them. Plain and simple. That's as sure of a fact as 2+2=4. Because bitcoin isn't the software, it is the network state, which is pure mathematics. 
And we continually find new gold to mine. You don't know the complete set size, and supply rate is always in question. They just found a massive gold mine in China. When we start mining asteroids your gold scarcity will be obliterated. 
With bitcoin, there's 21M ever to be produced. Given a block height, I can tell you the exact amount issued, and how much will be issued in a decade with fairly good accuracy. You can't change that. Well you can, but then you are out of consensus with everyone else.
So yes, it is stupid to compare it with gold, because it has much, much more going for it than gold.

By "all transaction data" in referring to blocks/transactions being the only things that can change the state, from the computer science sense of the word, and thus in order to fully know the state of the network, you need all information. 
People are trying to use semantics to claim Segwit is not a block size increase, which at a protocol level, is false. In order for the protocol to function entirely as designed, the excess information is needed. Obviously legacy nodes can still see Segwit transactions as valid transactions, however they do not have a full understanding of the state of the network.

You can split them yourself, using a node on each chain. Send your coins on the core node from PK1 to PK2. Enter PK1 into BCH node. Even if it's compromised, your core coins are already gone. They had replay protection, so your BCH would have still been there. Even if it wasn't, it would be at PK2 that you still control. 
Assuming your BCH was still at PK1, send it to any exchange you want. Simple. No one else is in charge of your coins. You don't have to depend on anyone else at any time.

Signatures take up an abnormal amount of block space, hence moving to a block "weight" scheme. 
Multisignature operations scale quadratically without segwit. With Segwit, all the signatures are moved outside of the area that actually counts, so the blocks only scale linearly per transaction. 
Long story short, without Segwit we would be doubling in block size very frequently, and now we can scale linearly instead.

Ok I'll play...


Ok, sure. Currently at 107%, with an extra 3% of GDP being added yearly, expected to increase after a tax cut. 


Lol, socialized losses is not a great way of recovering from free market failures. Every dime of that stimulus ended up in the stock market. Remember when I was talking about the stock market being separated from reality? Meanwhile, workforce participation has been dropping since 2008, and wealth inequality has spiked. The guy managing your 401k recovered, but you sure aren't better off. 


Yes, it's called quantitative easing, and it means there's a lot more money being introduced. CPI rise lags money introduction. Those closest to the source of money benefit. Those on the bottom get hit with higher prices with no income increase. We are about to see a stark increase in inflation. Hence the Fed increasing interest rates. Time to turn off the faucets. Also, GDP is measured in the native currency, which doesn't account for inflation.


Hmmm, like the FED raising interest rates, and showing no signs off stopping?


Of course we wouldn't. We would just print more money. I already said that. 


Ya citation needed. Economic uncertainty polls are through the roof, most are expecting another fed rate hike as early as December, and a large faction of mainstream economists today believe the Keynesian model is infallible, which is what lead us the national debt we have today.

Again, there is demonstrably no need for an immediate block size increase. Why would you advocate for a poorly developed hard fork, to increase capacity when there's no need for it. Transactions with fees &amp;lt;5 sat/byte are clearing. The high fee problem had much more to do with terrible prediction algorithms and transaction spam, than it did actual block capacity. Not to mention, there's literally a hard fork wishlist, with many more pressing things that could also be solved. So excuse me, for not advocating for a divisive, single issue, rushed hard fork, when there is clearly no need for it. Especially when a scaling option was just released, and isn't even being used to capacity. If 2020 rolls around, and 16GB RAM and quad cores become the bare bones for computer hardware, you can bet that I'll be in the bigger block camp, as would most people. But it is provable that larger blocks increase centralization, so why would you even advocate for it, when again, there is demonstrably no need. 


It takes a single transaction to do so. If you aren't moving them, there's no reason to believe they are going to be moved in a standard transaction any time soon, and that said transaction wouldn't also move them into a Segwit transaction. 


As opposed to the bulletproof btc1 code? Good thing a Core member was able to spot that they didn't even increase the block size correctly, and implement it for them. That would have been pretty embarrassing. 


Again, why is that a Core problem?


Semantics. Up to 4MB of data is included with every Segwit transaction block, in order to fully update ones view on the UTXO set. Again, you are proving my point. Block sizes have increased. 


Simply false. No model has ever depended on 100% adoption. 


Because being conservative with a multibillion dollar consensus network is probably a good idea. Given that if it breaks, many people's livelihoods would be ruined. Like it or not, we are beyond the "gambling" phase where you should "only invest what you expect to lose". People have paying jobs in this space. It's more than just a fun experiment now.

People seem so concerned with this replay protection issue, which I agree is disingenuous on S2Xs part, but is effectively a non issue unless you bank on selling your coins on that forked chain, in which case *you* are the one bringing the risk on yourself. 
With the way things are going, it's only a matter of time before a fork comes out, and the only way to access it is through a node on that fork, which is programmed to steal your private keys that are valid on the real chain. And you will have no one to blame but yourself and your greed for this happening to you.

No, a bear market is a downward trend. It is impossible to profit by buying only on a bear market. If you buy during a bear market, then any time within the future of a bear market, you have lost money, by definition. 
The only thing buying in a bear market does is lower your average basis, so that when the bear market finally breaks, you have a higher profit potential. 
The only way to profit in a bear market is with a combination of buying and selling (timing the market), and/or using short telling to your advantage (also timing the market).

@_date: 2017-10-17 17:45:20
Again, no, because the "Core Project" isn't 100% in stone to a Github page. All it takes to modify the code is to fork it entirely, and implement changes on your fork. If it is worthy, people will follow. 
BCH is hilariously awful and doesn't include Segwit, and BTC1 couldn't even correctly increase the block size without help from a Core contributor. That's why no one is following/contributing to them. Not because some Github page has a monopoly on the code. 
No one is forcing people to run Core code. People chose to, because of advancements like Segwit, Bech32, LN, and testing so thorough that they even find/fix critical flaws in software as ubiquitous as OpenSSL. Stop trying to make a boogie man where there is none. What has Core done to earn your distrust? Refuse to take a step closer to hardware centralization in the way of node centralization, something we know will be mitigated through general infrastructure upgrades with time?

This entire chain started from you saying with 51% someone could do "whatever they like"... which I proved false.

Again, I already said we exist in a state of compromise. In my eyes, RPi sized blocks is a compromise. Feel free to disagree and fork. Again, I'm not following.


No. Because what a "computer enthusiast" has running at his house, is entirely different than what can run on a solar panel in East Asian, or Sub Saharan Africa. That's the most privileged view of looking at Bitcoin I've heard in a while.


Yada, yada, again, that's not feasible in remote areas of the world, where bitcoin will have the biggest impact.


We have linear scaling rather than quadratic scaling. I take it you don't know much about computer science. That's absolutely monumental in terms of future scalability. Now, and base block size increase we have, will scale quadratically with linear growth, rather than linearly with quadratic growth.


On a RPi? I call bullshit.


That increase in infrastructure that you were just referring to *is what allows for this to happen*. It is more responsible though, because O(n), not O(n^2 )


I take it you've never run a node. Through experimentation, you can see *just how taxing* a small block node is, on RAM alone.


Again, what is "current" for us (cutting edge for the world) isn't feasible for the rest of the world. I don't care that you can run a fancy dancy computer. Bitcoin isn't for you. You have access to the most privileged banking system in the world.


How many nodes does BCH have? Also, its mempool transactions that are usually the most taxing, and no one uses BCH so the mempool is a joke.




Prove it. If that's the case, then I'm ok with it. RPi is the baseline. I call bullshit, but I'm open to being proved wrong.


I've run a node on a computer with 4GB of RAM, and it ran out out RAM within hours. That's my observation.


Hmmmm, I guess you never heard that they *couldn't even increase the block size correctly?* But yep, real geniuses you've got there.

It accomplishes exactly what it’s supposed to do. I’m curious where you see the short comings? Every 10 minutes a new block of transactions comes along. Just as it has been for almost a decade now. 
It’s a permission-less transactional protocol. It uses market economics to set a transaction fee rather than censorship. All monetary systems, yes, even the USD, depend on a settlement system. Why would bitcoin be any different? You’re staring at a model T talking about how it won’t be revolutionary because it’s loud and doesn’t have sat nav. And that’s fine. Because it doesn’t care about your opinion. You realize, after the *last crash* we had the most productive 2 years in terms of developer statistics, right? But those metrics don’t come up in do they?
And now you’re touting the features of “blockchain”?! ���� sure thing buddy ��. You’re worse than the hype boys. What do you think a blockchain is?

And there really shouldn't be an confusion in definition. You can not logically claim an increase in market value of 100% is not a bull market. That bottom marks the end of a bear market, the beginning of a bull market, and if it peaks again, would enter a new bear market.

In theory, from a protocol standpoint, a bitcoin transaction “fee” is entirely optional, and is more used to create a market for space on the blockchain. It’s a limited resource, where increasing it will result in tragedy of the commons, so there’s two ways to determine “spam” transactions.... either have a central authority chose what is spam and what isn’t, or have the market decide what is worth processing or not. 
2017 proved fairly well through bitcoin, and ethereum being clogged with crypto kitties that blockchains will in fact have scaling problems. It doesn’t make them useless, but it means that the once coveted idea of having all transactions of all sizes all confirmed on chain, first block, is likely not going to happen. If you have another coin that can, they are giving up something in return for that, usually in the case of general usership. 
It’s looking more and more like bitcoin is a settlement network on which cash like layers can be built on top of, rather than a cash layer itself.

This is the classic "Facebook vs MySpace" argument, but it fails to address the fact that people don't simply give up on store of value systems, if they still store value. When was the last time you ever paid for anything in gold? Chances are, no one would even accept your gold unless you drastically overpay for it. Yet pretty much the only actual demand for gold today is for a speculative store of value (even jewelry, which is the main demand, carries this connotation because gold is expensive because it's gold). 
Also, it points to a non existent replacement, without pointing to what would make someone want to switch to it. In my mind, that's not rational. Sure, it's possible that there's some unknown physical phenomenon, conjuring in the universe, that could take us out tomorrow. But we don't operate our lives in fear that this would happen.
I don't grant anyone the "something better can come along" argument as rational because a) they don't identify what would make it better and b) even if it did, value would remain in bitcoin, it would simply just have a smaller portion of the value store market cap.

And yet the 2X development crew's first iteration of the software completely failed to do as such, until it was pointed out to them and fixed for them...
There's much more than just the block size that can and should be put into a hard fork. That all takes development time. There's no consensus because it's a rushed fork, for no other reasons than a power grab. The block size will increase in due time, not because of some backroom "agreement".

Realistically, there's not a simple way, especially without replay protection in place. 
What you would need to do, would be enter those private keys into a node on the forked chain, post fork, and send them to a newly generated address/private key. Then, you should check the main chain, and be sure the transaction was not replayed. To be double safe, transfer your coins from a main chain node, to a *different* newly generated address. So you should at this point have the coins on each chain at different addresses, that you own... Do not send any coins to an address you do not own until this point. 
After you are at this point, your coins are split. You should generate a new paper wallet with your new keys for the bitcoins, and then trash your old keys. You can then, from the S2X node, send your coins wherever you want, and if you want to send them to an exchange, send them and sell them for real bitcoin, and make a new paper wallet for those coins (or you can reuse your old address, but that is not recommended).

If you have a cheaper option available (Segwit) yet you still choose to send a legacy transaction, which allows for less room of a block size increase, then you are clearly not concerned about block sizes or fees. 
Segwit is a 4MB block limit. Just because we haven't seen that, doesn't mean it isn't. If you want to see larger blocks, send more Segwit transactions. The fact that the Segwit blocks aren't full is plenty of reason to show that there's no need for a base block size increase.

Bech32 is a new type of address encoding (changes what the bitcoin address will look like), that allows for higher level of error detection. Basically, if you use a Bech32 address, and the wallet software implements like ~5 lines of some python code, it can detect up to 4 errors within an address, and tell with a very high degree of accuracy at least which 2 characters are wrong. 
In the near future, when you try to send money to an address, if you make a typo or two, you'll probably see an error pop up, not letting you send it, with a character or two underlined, telling you to check those characters again. 
It's just another feature, those evil blockstream developers came up with, in order to make it harder for you to accidentally send your money somewhere you don't want to. I hate those guys.

Yes and no. From a practical sense, if you lose the keys that give you the ability to spend them, then you have effectively destroyed them for all intents and purposes. 
The "no", is because the coins themselves are not actually destroyed. The coins don't exist physically, or even as a digital file. They are effectively a line on a spreadsheet, waiting for the correct key to be spent. If you could reconstruct that key again, you could spend them.
However, the likelihood of this happening is what gives bitcoin its security in and of itself. It is impossible to calculate a private key given a public key, so the only way to do it would be a brute force attack. The problem is that the number of possible private keys is on the order of the amount of atoms in the known universe, so it is effectively impossible, at least within a lifetime. 
This is not a problem necessarily because bitcoins are effectively infinitely divisible, and can divide up to 8 decimal places which can trivially be increased if needed. This is different from any form of money we've seen before, because effectively "supply" can be increased without diluting the overall "supply" (inflation), and instead we simply see prices fall in relation to bitcoin over time rather than rise. 
If you were to be told in 1925 that the price of a car would be 10s of thousands of dollars, you would not be able to grasp that level of inflation. But if it happens over the span of almost 100 years, people don't necessarily notice, and it is a non issue. The same will happen with falling prices due to lost bitcoin/deflationary properties.

Ok, I'll concede that you are right that it is "possible", on a very unrealistic, perfectly swinging market, to come out slightly ahead, at any particular peak on such a "bear" market (although that's arguably the beginning of a bull market).
But there's a troubling trend in your demonstration. Not only does your profit percentage basically at best keep pace with your cost basis (with what looks like a constant rate to be ahead on absolute best case scenario, and under further investigation would probably be directly correlated with your swing frequency), but your bottom end is drastically diverging from your cost basis. Meaning that over time, best case scenario you come out possibly very slightly ahead, worst case scenario, the longer you are exposed the the bear market, the higher your loss potential becomes. 
Add that with the realities of the market, and the pure statistical chance of coming out below literally growing much much faster than any profit percentage (which again looks constant), under no real world scenario would anyone come out with a "profit" in a DCA scenario entirely through a bear market. 
That's not to say a DCA isn't the best way to go for the casual investor, but it is certainly not a viable short term "profit" possibility.

They didn’t, the code today looks far different than the first iteration of the code. And it will continue to evolve. That’s the nature of open source. Accessory functions may be hard to implement in, but it’s not impossible to change to the point that critical flaws can’t be patched. And no, the fees are a feature, not a bug. Market economics, there’s no shortages. 


It is already implemented for all to use. A block is a packet of information on how to edit the database state. You can write your own implementation from scratch to request blocks, process them, and end up with the exact same utxo state.
You can even create your own code that will push blocks to the network and possibly get a reward for it if your block is properly formatted and valid as the next block in the chain. 
You are basically betting against gold here. There’s no real reason for gold to be valuable other than its circular nature of being valuable here. The same reason that circular nature has held for thousands of years is the same reason bitcoin won’t just be “forgotten about”. I don’t know how else to explain it to you.

"Mining" is a fairly arbitrary term and I'm not the biggest fan of it. 
Essentially, they are solving a statistical puzzle in order to get both the block reward and the fees. Not only will the price rise substantially when the supply halves, but miners decide which txs to include, so they can set minimum tx fees. 
So yes, there will always be miners, and eventually fees will be more important than block reward.

Meanwhile, bitcoin has hundreds of millions of application specific hardware dedicated to its security, a hash rate an order of magnitude higher than all other super world's in the computer can do, and satellites in space, covering 3/4 of the world's land mass, soon to be 100%. 100s of thousands of nodes, most behind the TOR protocol, all with a copy of the blockchain, backed by hundreds of terrawatts of hash work, making it the single most secure/immutable/uncensorable sequence of recorded events/data in the history of the planet. 
Meanwhile, developers are busy coding away at solutions like Bech32 encoding addresses optimized to the maximum error detection, MAST merkel tree hashing of pay to script hashes, the rapid development of level two scaling solutions because of the recent solution of transaction malleability, such as side chains that make atomic swaps possible, lightning network routing that allows for instant/private/extremely cheap transactions, and multi-signature addresses that allow for literally millions upon millions of permutations of private key combinations for n of m type spending.

Having run a node myself, it is very RAM intensive. People focus on the storage costs, but that's cheap. Transactions are held in RAM, and they all have scripts, that can get complicated, and all is performed in RAM. RAM rivals bandwidth accessibility, in the limiting hardware factors in running a node. 
And I use the RPi for two reasons:
1) because many people run a node on a RPi, because it is effectively negligible in terms of costs.
2) the stated goal of RPi is to be the most accessible computer platform on the planet. It's effectively and open source/non-profit project, targeted at getting computers into the hands of the third world. That being said, its a good baseline then, for minimal hardware for ubiquitous accessibility. Bitcoin isn't going to be revolutionary to you and me, as much as it is the remote portions of the world. Sure inflation is a drag, but what, 3% per year? At least we don't have trillion dollar bills. An ATM fee because I used the wrong ATM? Phoowie. At least I have access to my cash. Overdraft fee? At least I have a checking account. 
For 6 Billion people in this world, they don't have this access. There will be RPis, connected to solar panels, downloading bitcoin blocks via satellite, being run in East Asia. Bitcoin will connect 6 Billion people to 21st century banking. The RPi node will be as ubiquitous as a Nokia 1000 cell phone. 
It doesn't have to be a RPi. Maybe someone will come up with a bare bones, minimum hardware ASIC for validating bitcoin blocks. If you can bring the cost of running a node down to being accessible by the third world, then I'll listen to a block size increase argument. Or if you can show a RPi running larger blocks. I'll listen to a block size increase. 
But I'm not going to listen to a block size increase, when it costs less than $2 to send a transaction on the most secure value transfer protocol on the planet, within an hour, permission-less and trustlessly. All so what, we can go to ~10% of visa transactions? And *still* have a fee, *still* have to wait 3 blocks for complete confirmation, and *still* be 100% traceable forever and ever (those things aren't going away, they are baked into how the protocol works).
The argument is that not everyone needs to run a node. Sure, I'll agree. But not needing to, and not *being able to* are two completely different stories. I don't necessarily "need" an inflation hedge, because the USD is relatively stable (for now). But my only options are highly manipulated gold, or separated from reality stock market. Having the *option* of bitcoin, will keep inflation honest in the future. Having the *option* to run a node keeps the nodes honest. We already have a system with trusted nodes. Mine is called Wells Fargo, and they are currently in a multibillion $ litigation. I don't want to trust a node. Completely separate from the fact, that over time, even the privacy of bloom filters breaks down with a statistical analysis of SPV nodes.
We know that if bitcoin becomes more ubiquitous, so will dedicated hardware. That's only a matter of time. So, considering most people hold their coins anyways, you can't wait a few years, and let that hardware develop? Who knows, maybe in 5 years, RAM is dirt cheap, and 5G internet is ubiquitous and we can easily run 1GB blocks on an ASIC chip embedded on a Nokia 1000 with a pruned version of the block chain. But I do know, that if we centralize nodes now, we are never going to be able to get that power back once it is plausible in the future.

The beauty of bitcoin is that it is self verifying, and there can be more than one chain for each disagreement. If the majority of people want to raise the limit, sure, there would be a separate chain created with the new limit, but the old chain could just carry on as usual. And I will always have coins on both chains. It can never forcibly be removed. It may take a while to reach readjusting the difficulty, but there will always be a chain that has 21M coins, provable from the genesis block. Absolutely no amount of force can change that. Bitcoin is a network "state", and effectively exists in people's minds/computer memory.

You're awfully confident for clearly misunderstanding a fairly basic concept in bitcoin. 
A transaction is not prevalidated and can be generated, even if invalid, offline. It simply requires pointing to some UTXOs and singing the transaction. It looks like a paragraph worth of hex characters when it's encoded. You then transmit that transaction to the network. If it is valid, it gets forwarded to other nodes, and eventually will end up in a miner's mempool, and then a block. 
A replay attack simply requires taking a tx from one chain, and posting it to the other. If the UTXOs are still valid, then the tx is still valid. If you send me bitcoin on one chain, then I can take your tx, rebroadcast it on the other chain, and it would send the coins on the other chain to my address on that chain too. 
But if I send the coins to the same address on both chains, then send the ones I want to keep back, then the UTXOs are not valid on that chain (in this case the legacy chain). You can replay the S2X tx all you want, but the coins were moved on the legacy chain, so it would be rejected by the first node it got to. Even if you wanted to replay the tx on my initial move tx, I own the private keys of the address they are going to, so it does nothing other than save me the effort. 
But keep up with the overconfident attitude! Sure makes people respect your clearly extensive knowledge in that which is bitcoin!

With a 51% attack, there's only so much that can actually happen... really, only a 51% can only double spend, and someone could easily detect that and it would immediately trigger a POW change conversation to be taken seriously. I don't think that any miner wants that. 
I think the understanding that miners are out for their own benefit (much like everyone else), was a welcome realization, and all future code will take that into consideration. Clearly the bcash team never learned, considering the EDA plays right to miners, but by now, assuming bad actions by the miners should be a part of all defensive programming methods in bitcoin. 
I don't think the ASIC centralization issue is more than a short term problem. Geographically, they got lucky, that semiconductor manufacturing is easily available, but they very quickly discovered Moore's law, and while they got a head start, its only a matter of time till others catch up. Japan claims to be close to deploying a 7mm ASIC operation, which would dismantle the Chinese hold, especially during a nationwide crackdown. 
For miners, owning and operating equipment is a risky endeavor, and yes more profitable than selling the equipment, it is far riskier. The nation with computer chip manufacturing advantage will always have a slight edge over mining, however I think with the help of Moore's law, we will see mining equipment more available to the masses, and a rapid decentralization of mining in the future. 
I hope to see cheap ASICs developed for block validation, along with increased bandwidth available to bitcoin, or a separate communication protocol all together developed, so that we can increase block sizes substantially, while still having widely available, fully validating nodes.

It does, and when the majority of people in this space, who I respect the technical opinion of (i.e., just about no one on Reddit) deem it time to scale upward, and can present a case in what I deem a valid way, I will be swayed. If you would have just told me, "ya, we're going to put transactions into an anyone can spend transaction, and put all the sigs in a MT, and trust is, it'll work, I'd be skeptical. But that wasn't the case. Segwit was very transparent (albeit complicated to the layman) but from as much as I can grasp from a technical side it appears sound, it seems to be working just fine, and those who fully understand it don't seem to be worried, so why should I be? To date, all the fork proposals are clown shows where developers can't keep their node code from crashing, are presenting cases that even I can see the flaws in, and literally cannot even correctly change the block size because their lack of competence. Sorry, but right now just doesn't seem like the time for me to say "fuck it" and jump. Especially when just about everyone worth their salt in this space wouldn't touch that code with a 10ft pole. 


Well, it is provable with basic logic that any block size changes will result in *some level* of centralization/decentralization. That's not debatable. What is debatable, is what level we are comfortable with. We could decrease the blocks down to 1Kb, I could hook a dial up modem up to my microwave, and with a soldering iron, probably get a node implementation running on whatever microchip is in there. I don't think that anyone being reasonable thinks this is a valid reason to decrease block size though. On the other hand, any increase in block size could very possibly wipe out bare bones node setups across the world. How many? At what cost? Idk. I think it's valuable to describe what we mean by "decentralized", objectively, from a node standpoint. There are millions of people who mine, but they all mine in about 15-20 pools, and the top 5 of those hold majority hash rate. Is that decentralized? Compared to something like the FED, yes it is. But is that what our end goal is? I propose keeping it possible for computers within ~2 standard deviations from median level hardware as the viable bottom line. My microwave node probably isn't going to make that bottom 2.5% cutoff, but then again, who cares. Because "median hardware" is hard to quantify, instead I allude to the RPi. That's a nonprofit project dedicated to offering an affordable baseline computer to the underprivileged areas of the planet. I would consider this the absolute bottom at 2 standard deviations away from the mean. So, I think the ability to run an RPi, on a solar panel, as a full node, is a good objective goal to shoot for, because it's going to be the Nokia 1000 of bitcoin nodes. Either that, or someone come up with specific hardware, dedicated to running a full node at minimum resource cost, viable in a 3rd world environment. Bitcoin isn't "for" you and me. The USD has inflation, which sucks, but I go to work everyday, get direct deposit into my bank account, and can go to the grocery store and swipe a card and get access to food. That's pretty badass. Billions of other people can't do that. Bitcoin is their chance to do that. They are the goal here, not my ability to be trendy and buy a beer with bitcoin on chain. 


Well the general constituency of and is uneducated 19 year old males, who are notoriously overconfident in what they know, all trying to strike it rich. They aren't exactly basins for truth/intellectual discussion. 


Well, to be fair, Segwit was ready and was literally stalled for *years* (and arguably still is) by those exact same people, so you really can't blame Core for that lost time. I'm not worried. People were worried about the infeasibility of storing bitcoin in 2013 when hacks were rampant and no one understood PKI and now we have hardware wallets, with PKs in the form of 12 worlds that can even store altcoins and convert between them on the fly. I think it's stupid to spend gold you bought at $5 for $10, when the price could be $1300, so I don't really spend bitcoin but rather use it to store value until more liquid transfer options are available. But when I do it's usually in the $k range, so $2 for a fee doesn't really bug me. Hell, using the wrong ATM will net me about $5 in fees. 


Sure: fraud (n) - wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain
If "bitcoin" is the distributed ledger that bitcoin node runners are following, and you go and make another ledger, not compatible with the existing ledger, and then convince people that what you are selling is "bitcoin", you are quite literally deceiving someone who doesn't understand what is going on for your own personal gain. BTC1 has colluded with major players to present S2X as an "upgrade" when in reality, it is quite literally a different ledger. BTC1 has made this their strategy from the beginning, to use their existing influence in the infrastructure to make people just "assume" it's an upgrade.  
Think of it this way... let's say for hypothetical argument, the majority of the market accepts the core chain as "bitcoin" post fork. If Coinbase, is selling something called "bitcoin" that can't be accepted anywhere where people running an actual bitcoin node, would you not be pissed off of your grandmother bought "bitcoin" from Coinbase? Would you be even more so if she bought it at the price of the existing coin (assuming the existing one has market support)? Is that not fraud? Selling something fake, knowing that it is fake, as the real deal? And when the core HF comes eventually, the same argument could be made against it. We'll have to cross that bridge when we get to it. But "bitcoin" is what most people universally accept as bitcoin. It's a strange thing, but look up how flocks of birds navigate and it's strikingly similar. Maybe "bitcoin" never actually increases in capacity, but "Bitcoin Core" does, and with all the development support/market support it overcomes the chain left behind. At that point, maybe "Bitcoin Core" is that coin everyone in the media seems to think will take over bitcoin in the future. No one really knows. The only constant here is that it will all play out in time.

First off, just because someone says something doesn't make it true. Socialism has a specific definition, and it relies around the central societal control of capital. Good luck with that with the existence of bitcoin. 
I don't really care honestly, because I know from an absolute sense that I am correct, and the lack of the ability to inflate dollars to fund a future welfare state is going to be realized. There's no going around it. We've been ballooning the welfare state since FDR, and he even banned the ability to own gold because he knew it undermined his underlying vision. 
Well now, you can ban the ability to own bitcoin, but just like banning internet piracy, it isn't going to matter.

-What you have seen is miners and con artists using FUD to hold the system hostage, and refuse the ability to implement most of said benefits, namely solutions that required transaction malleability to be fixed, so that the alt coin market could sky rocket and fees could be gamed. 
Now we enter the optimization period where LN, Schnorr sigs, sidechains, etc can further optimize transaction sizes. Once these low hanging fruits have been picked, hardware will also have progressed autonomously, and scaling on chain should be a non issue, and a complete rebuild/wishlist packed HF can be implemented. 
Will it be contentious. At this point absolutely. But to date, I have seen absolutely 0 valid arguments that a decentralized group of developers is steering this project in the wrong direction. In fact, the only thing they can be charged with is retaining what was already the status quo, which in the midst of the global adoption of a multimillion dollar technology, is arguably better than going headstrong into a terrible solution, that demonstrably will centralize things (that's not debatable, *how much and if that level is permissible is debatable), to not even get to 1/10 of the capacity of visa. 
Decentralized computing is complicated. A blockchain is an astronomically inefficient way of reaching consensus. But we do it because it gives us freedoms that we don't have with Visa/Wells Fargo. If you want cheap/fast transactions, go with Visa. As a consumer, it is instant and free. If you want permission-less money that can not be seized from you and can not be censored, you're going to have to be able to be a little patient. Things will come. That is certain. But they doubtfully will come quickly, and rushing into objectively bad decisions has the ability to set that timeline back even further.

Again, the block size has nothing to do with time it takes to mine a block. The transaction merkel root is included in the block header, which is what is hashed. Adding transactions completely changes the merkel root, completely changing the block header, completely destroying previous mining progress. The nonce is the only thing in a block that changes during a mining process. 
Before a miner even starts mining, they gather as many transactions as they can, *up to the mempool limit*, and then put them in a block. Hashing a block with 1 tx takes just as long as hashing a block with 2tx etc etc once you have the Merkel root. 
What's happening with bcash is the difficulty is ratcheted back by 20% every few hours and it eventually gets so low that it can be profitable to mine and then dump the coins. Then when the difficulty goes back up, they completely abandon it, which then triggers the EDA to move the difficulty back again. So you have times where miners are mining blocks that are extremely easy to find, with the amount of hash power available to them, and then no blocks mined at all.

Did you miss the diatribe about microwave ovens on dialup and RPis and 2 standard deviations? Because I pretty well addressed my views on what is acceptable: block sizes that allow someone in a 3rd world environment to run a full node. If you can put together a study showing how 8MB worth of data (S2X) can be run on an RPi reliably, then I think a large portion of the Core dev team would support it as well. But right now, that doesn't exist, so we move on with the status quo. 


Not exactly what I said, but yes, representing something as something that it isn't is fraud. I think I already addressed "bitcoin" as being a loosely defined flock mentality construct, so at the minimal, there should be a clear distinction as to the fact that you are buying a coin on which chain you are buying it on. I.e. Call one bitcoin and the other a distinct name (because it is in fact a different coin at that point). If the market overwhelmingly supports it as bitcoin, then that's bitcoin. I don't see that happening at all with S2X but even if it does, I'd still follow core development. Probably just hold both coins. But Id go along with S2X being called "bitcoin" if that's what is widely shown to be "bitcoin" post split. 


Not without giving each a fair chance. I don't have a problem with them selling each as two separate things. But the initial plan for BTC1 from the beginning was to not even present it as an option, and purposely use replay attacks to make it very confusing. That's fraud. By definition. 


I would say so. I don't see that happening, but if there's clear market support for S2X, clear infrastructure support for S2X, and clear development support for S2X, then clearly S2X is "bitcoin". Again, highly unlikely imo, and I'd be more interested in "Bitcoin Classic" at that point, but I wouldn't mind letting the world make S2X sky rocket in value, and then dumping it for the coin that I see actually revolutionizing the world through its useful features. And no, "100% traceable electronic cash with fees and wait times" isn't a useful feature imo, because again, I live in the first world and have venmo/visa which are instant and free for me.

There's an entire section in **Mastering Bitcoin** by Andreas Antonopoulos, dedicated specifically to this, called “Using an Extended Public Key on a Web Store".
I believe the first edition of this book is available for free, and it is the last section in the Wallets chapter. 
Basically, there is a feature, built into bitcoin, called extended public keys, which plays exactly into what you are trying to do, generating a new address for each transaction, all from the same key, through the use of HD wallets. There's some other really cool features attached to this too if I remember right. I remember reading it and being blown away. 
Edit- except from the book:
“Gabriel copies the xpub to his web store’s bitcoin shop software. He uses Mycelium Gear, which is an open source web-store plugin for a variety of web hosting and content platforms. Mycelium Gear uses the xpub to generate a unique address for every purchase.”
Excerpt From: Andreas M. Antonopoulos. “Mastering Bitcoin.” O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2017-06-19. iBooks. 
So, sounds like you should look into Mycelium Gear, which allows you to upload your extended public key into, which can generate unlimited new addresses on demand (and thus also link purchases to wallets/transactions automatically using a database). Your extended private key can live on a hardware wallet, so even if your site is hacked, they only have your already freely available public key, and your coins are secure on be hardware wallet.

Yes, bitcoin is stored essentially at a random number between 0-2^256, which is basically like picking a single atom out of the universe, and assigning value to it. If someone finds your atom, they can get your value. Because this is mathematically so unlikely, we can assume it is impossible, assuming you chose your random number with suitable entropy. 
Bitcoin just keeps track of what value is stored where. You can think of it as simply as a 2 column spreadsheet. Every 10 minutes, your node will read all the transactions in a valid block, verify they are correct, and update that spreadsheet accordingly. 
In a split, someone is just copying and pasting that spreadsheet, and changing the rules on how you can change that spreadsheet. But your value is still stored at your random number, and you can just input that random number into a node interacting on that chain, and move them to an exchange. Trezor will likely implement a way to ensure replay protection. If you are unsure, just wait. 
But tl;dr, yes because your Trezor holds your keys (random numbers) on it, and you are the only one who can access those random numbers, that is the safest place you can keep your coins pre split.

"Progression" towards what is the question. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:37:40
Do you understand what a blockchain actually is? Because looking through your comments you seem to have quite a hardon for "blockchain" and quite a vendetta for bitcoin, but clearly you don't understand how they coexist. 
It's effectively a Byzantine tolerant consensus mechanism. In other words, it helps a group of computers, come to agreement on the current version of something (in this case, a payment ledger), in a way where you don't have to trust anyone else, and where all you have to do is follow your own rules. 
That has very little purpose for something like a bank. If the bank is keeping the ledger on who owns what, why would you waste all the energy running a POW algorithm, and wasting all that time just to come to consensus, when you could just directly query the authoritative source? Or if another bank lies to you, you just sue them? A blockchain is an astronomically inefficient way of coming to consensus. But we do it because it removes trust from a central authority which has failed us time and time again. If all you want is hash stamping for database entries, you don't need a blockchain for that. We've been doing that for decades now. In fact, most banks probably already implement it. 
What makes you think bitcoin exists in a vacuum? When you buy a stock, do you just assume that the price going up/down is what influences all purchases/sells? Or do you examine the company's debt, its PE ratio, its book valuation of assets, cash flow etc? Why would bitcoin be any different, when you have hundreds of math PhDs and computer scientists, who could be making 6 figures elsewhere working day in and day out adding things like MAST and Bech32 address encoding, Segwit, sidechains, and other features to it? Is all of that useless? The ability to mathematically prove the transfer of value in a trustless way is worthless? Please, enlighten me on your qualifications that allow for you, clearly someone not invested in a temporal or monetary sense, to see the immediate flaws in bitcoin, that hundreds of PhDs and world renowned computer scientists working on the system for almost a decade fail to see? Please, let us all know exactly what the flaws are so that we can inform these guys and they can apply their efforts elsewhere?

I think you are vastly overestimating the issue. 
Segwit was effectively a non issue, other than a slight speed bump and a learning lesson on how to implement changes. Most of the core devs kept on developing their Segwit dependent projects, while waiting patiently for Segwit to be activated. 
Some core devs pushed for a UASF, which pushed action, but by and large, they just ignored the issue and kept on developing. The same is going to happen here. No replay protection only hurts those intending to spend on the 2X chain. If you care to keep your 2X coins, or sell them, you can always take the extra effort to split your coins yourself. Otherwise, if you just ignore it, like before, everything will work out because the S2X dev team is awful and overtime the real bitcoin will rear its ugly/beautiful head again. 
Really, I think S2X is getting fuel from the controversy/FUD surrounding the situation. If we just ignore them, as with all the other future forks, it won't make any difference. If they don't have your private keys, they can't spend your coins on the real bitcoin chain. It doesn't matter what replay/non replay protection they have. Just ignore it.

Number 1, nothing at this point is going to unify this space. You have too many people involved now, and there's too much at stake. Combine that with the majority having absolutely no idea what bitcoin is other than a speculative asset in a market, and nothing you can do is going to get everyone on the same page. The best thing that can happen now is time to allow for development to occur. Minimal distractions would be nice, but the amount of defensive development that has come out of these few years will be very beneficial in the future.
And to answer your question, core is a group of separate developers. Some are funded by companies, but you would think that makes them Satan spawns themselves, and the rest of the others do it in their spare time. Development takes time. They have lives outside of bitcoin (well, most do hopefully). They are currently involved with the low hanging fruit. The full HF is next. No one is stopping you from developing it. Put some code together, introduce a BIP and scale bitcoin. 
The problem is, this entire debate has nothing to do with scaling. It has everything to do with control. Core's roadmap pretty much decimates the long term viability of all major companies in this space. Pretty much everything they do is going to be open source and easier/free within a decade. BTC1 has made it very clear that this is a divorce from Core. Which is fine, run your own code. But to expect my node to run it? Expect my value to follow along? No thanks. I'm not a computer scientist. I'll trust my node running the software that has yet to fail me, and has brought this project to where it is today, with all the exciting possibilities on the horizon. If something changes, maybe I'll change my viewpoint. But an evil blockstream developer is currently implementing a solution to make it harder to make a typo on bitcoin addresses. That asshole. We should divorce from him. 
And those studies (well at least the bitfury one) clearly show an upper limit at about 4MB. Guess what the maximum block size with witness data is in Segwit? Doubling that definitely pushes the limits. How much will drop off? Idk. Maybe you fund a more current study? But I'm not going to just go along with a "well that was years ago, we are *probably* good now" argument. Prove it. The amount of research that goes into any BIP is mind blowing. Watch the video on Bech32. Non of it made much sense, other than as a mechanical engineer, watching another engineer present their case methodically, addressing all critics with data to explain exactly why they did what they did. Quite impressive really. Why not put together a study showing that it is possible, soundly putting all concerns to rest?
My understanding is pretty limited from an absolute standpoint, but I believe what takes up the most resources is the scripts for the UTXOs being held in RAM. Anecdotal, but I have a node running, and without disabling the mempool, RAM usage is intense. At the same time, CPUs are pretty much breaking down from Moore's law, and we've been stuck at +/-3GHz clock for a while now. RAM is getting cheaper though, and maybe that problem is mitigated in the near future. Bandwidth is a major problem, especially in rural areas even here in the US. But from the sounds of it, 5G is already making fiber obsolete, so maybe in 2-3 years we have the room for 32MB blocks. If core is still actively fighting for small blocks, without an updated argument, when it is demonstrably possible to run larger blocks on most hardware worldwide, maybe I will be swayed. 
But from my standpoint, all I see is a shotty effort to divorce some of the most intelligent people in the field, from the project that they built for no real reason other than what looks like fear for their own businesses. Who would have thought that bitcoin companies would be obsoleted faster than traditional banks were? Just goes to show how revolutionary bitcoin is imo.
The bottom line is, the common theme here is time. We know one thing is for certain: things optimize around consumer demands. If consumers want faster/cheaper transactions that run on the bitcoin protocol, the entire internet infrastructure can literally be shaped around that. Computer infrastructures can be built around that. Who knows, maybe a bitcoin validation ASIC is as ubiquitous as a Bluetooth chip in all future hardware. I don't pretend to know the future, but I know this entire "scaling problem" is being worked on by people astronomically smarter than me, and so far they are succeeding wonderfully imo, and there's still much much more in the pipe. So excuse me, if I have a sting vigor against a group of inexplicably bad programmers, trying to convince businesses to commit literal fraud, in an effort to remove those people from the project that they built.

You would need to run a node on each chain, and yes, your goal is to use addresses that you control, to get to a point where the coins you own on each chain are in different addresses. This can be tricky if someone is replaying transactions maliciously, but transactions don't just automatically replay. They must be broadcast to the other chain.
Bottom line, don't send coins anywhere you don't control them, until you are sure they are are different addresses for multiple confirmations.

Mastering Bitcoin is very dense, but very thorough. Imagine a bitcoin textbook. Can bring you from a minimal understanding to an 8-9/10 understanding very quickly (assuming you have a basic understanding of computer science principals). Not for faint of heart though. Many times, if something didn't click exactly, I just kept pushing through, or I at least know the basics and know where I can go back to reference it in detail if needed again in the future. 
"Internet of Money" is a much easier book, that is basically his best talks, edited and put into an order that makes it flow pretty easily. Read it in about 2 days. Very optimistic about the future of bitcoin (as he is in all his talks), but in a way that is completely separate from the market price.

You're trying to conflate a market economy with some utopian pipe dream where people only have to work when they want to, and only doing things they want to. 
That's not possible. There are always tasks that are going to require people doing things they don't want to do, unless you want to go back to living in caves wiping your ass with your hand in the river. Welcome to a functioning society. 
The only way to convince someone to do something they don't want to do is by offering them something so they deem it is worth while. That includes cleaning bathrooms in McDonald's. It's not my problem if they deem it worth while to do that for minimum wage. 
So you can't get rid of the compensation model, without forcing people to do things. Why on earth would anyone voluntarily choose to work a nasty manual labor job in Leui of a cushy office job? That's what you are implying. You need to draw to that logical conclusion because the path isn't clear.

On chain bitcoin will never replace cash for the majority of people. There are 3 things in bitcoin on chain transactions that will not go away:
1) Confirmation time. Bitcoin has a block time targeted at 10 minutes. This isn't because of slower technology, this is because bitcoin is a distributed ledger, and it takes time for a decentralized, attack vulnerable computer network to reach "consensus" on the "state" of the network. "Consensus" and "state" are in quotes because they carry extra meaning in computer science. The bitcoin network broadcasts a block to update the network state, and then every single node needs to download, verify each transaction individually by running its encumbrance script, update it's UTXO set accordingly, and then propagate that block to other nodes, which all have to do the same steps. This takes time. This is a tradeoff we have for not having a central authority to just query the answer from. This is what makes bitcoin so special. Also, by stretching the block time, it allows for transactions to be grouped up, making more efficient use of block space, POW, and bandwidth, rather than sending an update every tx. Other coins have different consensus mechanisms, but they all come with trade offs. In bitcoin, we already accidentally fork 3-4 times a week in what is known as "orphaning", where we see the real time affects of propagation times, and the network has two valid blocks for the same block height. That's why we have to wait 3+ confirmations, to ensure that your tax wasn't put into a chain that will be orphaned. If we decrease the block time, we risk increasing the amount of orphans, which means we need to wait for more confirmations. It's a zero sum game. This is critical to how bitcoin works, and isn't going away. 
Contrast this to visa/cash/venmo, where I can send money immediately. Centralized ledgers are much faster. 
2) Tx fees. This isn't 2013 anymore where 25 BTC block rewards are a thing. Block rewards will continue to decrease and fees will continue to play more and more of a roll. Miners need compensation to run their equipment. It's not about greed, it's literally about allocation of resources, because electricity costs money to produce. This is the price we pay for a fixed limit (21M). The other alternative, is to remove the cap, and increase the block reward again. Many people are opposed to open inflation on bitcoin. This would be a contentious HF. I wouldn't be following it. Tx fees are here to stay. 
Contrast this with cash/visa/venmo where there are no fees, or the vendor covers them.  Centralized ledgers are much more efficient. 
3) Traceability/Lack of Fungibility. Fungibility is crucial to a well functioning currency. If some BTC is worth less than other BTC it causes massive issues. Bitcoin is 100% traceable. It's not easily traceable, but it's 100% doable. People are sitting in jail right now because of it. The way UTXOs work is fundamental to bitcoin, and you cannot change this without a 100% redesign. 
Contrast this to cash which has the potential to be 100% non traceable. 
That doesn't mean bitcoin is worthless or failed. Quite the contrary. While decentralized ledgers are slow and inefficient, they are also open, immutable, and censorship resistant, resistant to any tyrannical force abusing the system. What other asset do you know that is absolutely fixed in supply, beyond a mathematical concept? I can't think of any. Bitcoin is an awful currency, but it is a phenomenal decentralized value construct, that currency can be built on top of an backed by. And there's currently many of those systems being built right now. LN is just one of them, but when creativity and ingenuity is permission-less and open, people come up with incredible things. 
Looking at onchain transactions as a replacement of cash misses the massive underlying opportunity here, that we finally have an open value transfer protocol, that is universally understood and has no central point for corruption. Currency is simply a way of communicating transfer of value. It's an app, not a protocol. Bitcoin is a protocol. There will be many currency apps, some better than others, that will all use bitcoin as their underlying protocol.

Do you understand how POW works? Litecoin requires, even with the same difficulty, 25% of the work. Is that not, by definition, not as secure? I never stated it took 10 minutes to propagate blocks. But even with 10 minute blocks, we still get orphaning. 


No, again, there's a lower bound to block times. That's not debatable. And yes, again, they are sacrificing security in exchange for faster blocks, with 1/4 of the work required. 


I don't think I ever called it unstable? But you can't just claim that because it hasn't been disproved, it is probably stable.


Lol, because no one really cares about Litecoin. That's like pointing at D1 sports and the controversy surrounding it, and then pointing at D2 sports and saying they are superior because they don't have the same controversy. Is Litecoin really superior morally? Please.

That's the multi billion dollar question isn't it? I would argue that it is not something that corporate/business interests can literally deceive the general public into believing it is an entirely different chain, on different consensus rules, when there is a sizable portion of the userbase that disagrees. 


I mean you can argue that, but bitcoin core is a meritocracy. If you want to propose a BIP for a 2MB base size increase, feel free. But the fact that the mempool is not full, and there is demonstrably no need for it *immediately*, especially when many other technical limitations could also be fixed in the same block size increase, you had better have very sound technical backing to debate arguably the most experienced individuals on the planet on the topic. Thus far, all I've seen has been a shotty attempt at a single issue for fork, where they couldn't even correctly increase the block size (the single issue). 


And yet, the leaders of the S2X group have openly stated this is their reasoning. Does that not make them idiots?


It is not "simple" but if all it takes is being a relative monopoly of all the infrastructure, then it sure doesn't inspire hope. "Bitcoin", the actual decentralized vision, will live on, but be set back substantially. "Bitcoin" is in the world's eyes, and yet, what they will be focused on will be a hijacked version of it, because Coinbase et all say it is. And the media is going to believe a multimillion dollar enterprise much more than some people on Reddit. But does that change the absolute truth of the matter? I don't think so. If the same conglomerate decides to increase the 21M coin limit, is it still bitcoin at that point?


Bitcoin is a technical project first and foremost, and all evidence points to smaller blocks, for the time being, are technically superior when trying to bootstrap a global decentralized consensus network. So when there are goals (a global, decentralized consensus network) and objectively correct ways of approaching those goals (bigger blocks increases centralization, that is not debatable, how much is debatable) then really there is no room to compromise.
And to say Core didn't deliver a block size increase is patently wrong. Blocks currently are larger than 1MB with Segwit. scaling is much more than a linear problem, when multisig operations scale quadratically. When global infrastructure increases to allow for substantial base block size to increase, the base block size will be increased, along with other technical upgrades that require a hard fork. Until then, we will continue to work with what we have, just like the early internet was developed on infrastructure designed to transmit voice.

Jesus Christ, the FUD is strong with this one. 
Not a fork? Little to no testing? Co-opt existing coins?
Let's clear this up once and for all:
We know exactly what happens when someone breaks consensus rules. A second chain forms off that block if they keep mining on top of that block. This does not affect your coins on the original chain. The lack of replay protection only matters if you care about the forked chain. If not, it doesn't matter to you. If you do, it's not very difficult to split your coins.
This is not rocket science. Relax. If you are worried about it, run your transactions through your own node.

First off, people don't abandon store of value mechanisms as easily as they switch from AOL to Netscape to Firefox to Chrome, or MySpace to Facebook. Those are completely asymmetric in terms of cost for the user to switch. Look at precious metals. When was the last time you saw "gold coins" accepted as payment for anything outside of a neckneard memorabilia shop? Even if I wanted to spend the gold equivalent of USD at a shop, chances are no one would take it. The only way someone would accept it would be to vastly overpay for something. Yet, there's a market, specifically for gold, at $1200 per oz. 
Secondly, you don't get to just point to something and say it will be replaced, without pointing to a valid replacement and giving just cause. Btw, bitcoin set the bar by being open access and open source, so any replacement will need to be both. And if it is open source, what stops us from just stealing the better features. Bitcoin is a network state as much as it is a protocol. What gives bitcoin value is the fact that you can't send anyone bitcoin without first acquiring bitcoin somehow. So let's say crypto xyz has 1000% a better protocol for consensus rules. What stops us from simply hard forking to that code, keeping all accounts the same, with all the cool new features of xyz code? Absolutely nothing. If the world has wealth in 1 system, they aren't just going to abandon that abstract concept for another one. They will fit that system to the new one. Just like bitcoin has to have exchanges to fit into our current system. 
Third, we already have a floating/competing currency system. Your currency is traded daily against other currencies, and yes, currencies, like the euro devalue in relation to other currencies. But that doesn't mean everyone just floods away from the Euro. 
And national debt most definitely is a major issue. Interest is owed on that debt. And you know how countries pay interest when they run at a deficit? By taking out more debt! And where does that money come from? They print more of it! So in order to pay for a welfare state and ridiculous military spending, they simply balloon the debt and tax people holding onto money. Better yet this "stimulates" the economy because in order to keep your earned value from being taxed through inflation, you need expose it to investments.
Eventually, the markets no longer reflect the reality of what they are, ownership in a earnings driven company. Look how many companies don't even pay dividends anymore. It's all based on capital gains. And where does that capital come from? Inflation of course! And sooner or later this entire Ponzi scheme grows out of control until the music stops, banks tighten money and interest rates, and we still have liabilities to pay (principal and interest on national debt),  and it becomes a musical chairs game on who can grab onto the most amount of commodities as possible as fiat wealth evaporates as quickly as it appeared. The last time this happened, in 2008, we bought our way out, printing trillions of dollars. And since inflation is measured as a CPI which is only a reflection of money supply, were now seeing the affects of that inflation. The Fed is upping interest rates. Money will start tightening. The only option we will have "for national security" is to print more money to cover our debts. Another tax on the value of your money. 
Or you can have a money that cannot be diluted. One where prices drop over time, and spending power increases, one that doesn't push a consumer mindset that destroys the world, one that can't have its value siphoned in order to feed the military industrial complex that churns out killing machines, or fund a welfare state designed to keep an underclass of drones voting to keep their benefits coming. Just imagine, an economy built on the solid foundation that if you work hard and save your money, you can escape financial oppression. There's no luck or special access required.

Sure anything with a centralized source Dan be done instantly, because the centralized source just becomes the final word and no consensus is needed. Time to reach consensus is what takes bitcoin (and all other blockchains) time. There’s a reason the block time will recalibrate to 10 minutes if it worked it’s way up. 
And no system will ever be free to use. It’s not physically possible. As long as it takes some sort of energy to process the information, someone is eating the cost. If it is “free” then you are the thing that is for sale.

Pretty much any actually secure client-server password scheme uses PKI, which is exactly what bitcoin uses. 
Most passwords *are* stored, encrypted, as a one way hash (certainly not md5 however considering it has known collisions), and that is the string that is typically compared to what is sent in from a user (which is probably both client side hashed, and then server side hashed before being compared).
Tl;dr -your example plays to my point.

In bitcoin, you have transactions, and those transactions are grouped together into blocks. Each time a block comes out, the transaction is "read" by the node, and then your view of the network state is changed accordingly. Imagine having a spreadsheet, that has accounts and balances. If everyone starts with the same spreadsheet, and makes the exact same changes, in the exact same order, then they can stay in sync without necessarily talking to each other directly. That's essentially a high level view of how bitcoin works. 
Transactions, are sort of like emails. They have a specific format, with certain required parameters. Imagine it like filling out a check. Each blank has a certain field of information that is required, and needs to be in a certain format. If you put the recipient name in the "amount" box, it's not going to be a valid check. It doesn't stop you from doing it however, it just stops that check from clearing. But you can take hundreds of checks, put them in incorrect formats, and send them out. 
The same works with bitcoin. Normally, transactions are created off of a node's view of the network state. But I can make a properly formatted transaction, for 22M coins to myself, and broadcast it to the network, there's nothing stopping me. The first node that gets it, will then check the validity, realize it is bogus, and block me. But the main idea is that transactions are separate from their actual validity. Transactions are just packets of information, that will then be checked for validity. They come in a serialized format, and resemble about a paragraph size worth of seemingly random characters, that are then decoded by the node on the other side. 
If a chain forks, the spreadsheet that keeps track of accounts and balances begins to diverge. Most of it will be the same, but because one chain has different rules than the other, they will process different transactions, and will exceedingly look more and more different. If you don't broadcast a transaction though, neither chain has instructions to change your balance, and you balance stays the same on each chain. 
Now let's say you want to transact on chain 1. You use your chain 1 node, draft a transaction, and then broadcast that transaction to other chain 1 nodes. It gets picked up, it's a valid transaction, the spreadsheet is updated, and life is good. 
***In a replay attack***, someone can go into the last block of chain 1, grab all of the transactions, and because they are just packets of information/instructions, their validity isn't tied to any chain in particular. In an attack, they can simply grab the serialized transaction that was valid for chain 1, and then broadcast that transaction onto chain 2. Because it was valid on chain 1, and those coins haven't moved since the split, ***the transaction is also valid on chain 2***. The information in the transaction just says, pay this public key (who you are paying), this much amount, from this public key (your public key), and here is a signature, proving I own the private key to that address. If all the ingredients are still there, and the amount is still at the old public key, ***it will replay the same transaction on chain 2, even if you didn't mean to***. If you don't control the public key that it went to, you just lost the coins on that second chain. 
Replay protection, is just some method of preventing transactions from one chain to be valid on the other chain. It could be as simple as requiring something specific for one chain to be included in the transaction, that wouldn't necessarily be in a transaction on the other chain, or would invalidate it on the other chain. 
It is disingenuous to not implement replay protection, because it causes confusion at best, and prevents people from dumping their coins on your chain because it would mean they also dump their main chain coins. Realistically, if you ignore a fork, don't try and dump your split coins, and continue to run a node on your preferred chain, you wouldn't even have to care about replay protection. But the idea that a group is purposely not implementing it, for their own strategy, is malicious and should be viewed as an attack.

The problem is, the revolutionary thing about bitcoin is at the computer science/protocol level. 
On chain bitcoin won't ever compete with MasterCard, because it is irreversible, has consumer fees, and takes at least 10 minutes for a basic confirmation. None of that is going away. That's baked into how bitcoin works. And given that all of those idiosyncrasies make for a terrible end user experience compared to the status quo, there's very little incentive to switch other than to be a hipster or a very specific reason (like dark web/money transmittance).
Explaining how bitcoin is revolutionary is like explaining TCP/IP to the layman. Or ACH to the layman. Most people won't ever interact with bitcoin directly, and if they do, it will be the asset bitcoin, not the protocol Bitcoin. 
There's only so much you can actually say to explain the ridiculous potential of a decentralized Byzantine tolerant consensus protocol to the layman other than to jump to the end product. If someone isn't interested in computer science, no amount of articles at any level is going to get them interested in Bitcoin.

You literally dismissed my point of using crypto currencies on a dark market website because the volumes were low. Which also, btw is completely bullshit of a statistic... all dark market transactions are off chain, only cashing in/out is on chain, and I would love to see where you sourced that it is only .01% of transactions. Trying to estimate the purpose of any on chain transactions, or what percentage of all transactions they represent is a fools game.

2017-2015 != 40, but ok. 
And I'm not arguing that 8MB would immediately break anything. You questioned the claim that block sizes increases lead to centralization. I showed a paper that not only supports that fact, but shows it's reasoning that can be applied to any block size increase. There *are* limiting factors, and going upwards in capacity, *does* centralize to some level. That isn't arguable. What is arguable, is that level centralization significant?
And again, I frankly don't care what the original intention was. The fact of the matter is, it was originally intended to be "electronic cash" which it is wholly awful at doing. It is excellent at being a value transfer protocol, one that cash equivalent layers can be built on top of. A whitepaper is not a bible. Things change, all of the time. Hell, I used to write 4-5 white papers a week for internal communications within my company. It's supposed to be a primer to an idea, to convince people it's worth exploring. So sorry, but your wish to transact with online retailers isn't interesting to me (and clearly many other people given we still have small blocks), and the way the protocol works, your voice doesn't have any more significance than mine. 
We are talking in circles here now, but the point is very few people are wholly against any blocksize increase. But again, there's demonstrably no need for one at the moment, when we already have a capacity expansion option, not being used to capacity.

Citation needed. Nobody is deceiving me into running what I believe to be the most superior code base. Also, BTC1 chain split tokens are at ~.1 token for token, which means that the majority of trading action on BTC1 will be people dumping it. Coinbase verified polling shows overwhelming support for smaller blocks, and the node count isn't even close. The only thing BTC1 has is *signaling* of hash power, and any miner who dedicates 100% of their mining power (or majority imo) to the BTC1 coin is an idiot, deserving to lose the money they are going to.


Bitcoin is an open protocol. You can always fork off with your own coders, and convince people to follow. The S2X team has terrible reasons to follow them, outside of their abysmal code, but that doesn't mean they don't have the right to do it.


Again, citation needed. I don't think any of the coders think they are economists. But they do have economic sense (understanding of tragedy of the commons), and they are overwhelmingly libertarian, so it would make sense that a fee market should be how transactions are chosen for processing. What would you prefer? A selection committee? The market is the best way to decide what is spam and what isn't. If someone is willing to pay the price to send a transaction, it isn't spam.


Sure... the [mempool is filled with ridiculously low fee transactions]( that clearly the transactor doesn't care about as much as those who could send as low as a 100 sat/byte fee to include a transaction on the most secure, immutable, permissionless value transfer protocol on the planet. Fee market. It makes sense.


You can "cite" all you want. That's appeal to authority and is no substitute for logic. Fuck Satoshi. He was a mortal. Gavin isn't as smart as he thinks he is (he's an advisor to, what, 3 failed coins now?) If you think BCH was a "successful hard fork" I'm not arguing with a rational person. Does EDA mean anything to you?


I disagree. You are free to disagree and fork. But I'm going to dump your coin. You don't get my demand to follow just because you pitch a fit. And if you want a big block fork so desperately, why don't *you* code it? Because that's the only way you are going to get my consensus and demand on your fork.


That's such a simplistic view of bitcoin. "Bitcoin" the protocol is a consensus mechanism used to track the distribution and transfer of "bitcoin" the asset. "bitcoin" (lowercase b), the asset, is a network state, and a combined hallucination of value. You can have the chain with 3x as much work as the one I remain on, but "bitcoin" will continue to be what people *want* it to be, which will be what has the market demand. You can come in, with 90% of the hash power, and start issuing hard forking blocks that issue you 50 BTC per block, meanwhile stalling the legacy chain, and you can end up with the longest chain. Does that mean your chain is "bitcoin"? No. It just means you are an asshole, and the world can move on without you. Again, Satoshi was wrong. It isn't the chain with the most work. Its the chain that people *want*. And if that requires building all new payment processors, wallets, etc. etc. to make that happen, it will eventually happen.


Encryption secures the network, not hash power. Hash power is a deterrent from having someone try to gain control of the system, but that's sort of useless if someone (or an oligarchy) gains controls the system. Again, "bitcoin" is the network state that users want, and we could always just change the POW. That doesn't change "bitcoin".


Who is everyone? Pretty much everyone I've seen doesn't refer to it as Bitcoin. Coinbase can call it bitcoin, but that doesn't mean it's now bitcoin. Again, "bitcoin" is what the people/market decides it is.


Have you been paying attention to any of the S2X mailing list? They openly admit it is about wrestling the power away from Core. They openly admit that their strategy is to fraudulently present their fork as a "upgraded version" of "bitcoin". Core's entire roadmap consists of making every one of their business models obsolete to native features in the protocol. None of these companies want that.  


During the BU debates, this was brought up as a solution to fees. Fees exist because block rewards decrease. This is entirely possible. And under your definition of what "bitcoin" is, they could very well make it so by just having the "longest work chain". See how that description makes no sense? Hypothetically, if they did that tomorrow, and presented it as bitcoin, would you just go along with it? Its the chain with the most work... See how that definition is flawed?


There's a level of tradeoff. I already mentioned that. Bigger blocks leads to centralization. Smaller blocks leads to decentralization. That's not debatable. What is debatable, is *how much is permissible*. I don't see any benefit to being able to run a node on a cell phone, vs a RPi, because an RPi is not infeasible for anyone in the world. The purpose of it, is to be the most accessible computer on the planet, and so it makes for a good bottom line.


It would not be useful at all. The purpose of a blockchain is decentralized ledger keeping. You don't have a blockchain at that point, you just have timed hash stamping which has existed for ages.

Anonymous and ISIS are ideas/ideologies, not organizations. There's no official sign up for Anonymous/ISIS. You simply align yourself with a common goal. 
If aligning yourself with a common goal is how you would define an organization, that doesn't require any hierarchy format at all. And the second your views differ from someone else's goal, does that mean you now have 2 different organizations?
One person is in charge of operating the Github page, which is loosely structured as an organization to service the common project known as "Bitcoin Core". Your main concern roots in the idea that the people in charge of such an "organizational structure" get corrupt and block changes, which is entirely possible, but again, I argue this doesn't affect "Core" the project overall, and the project just moves elsewhere, most likely to a different Github page. We've already seen attempts of that with BCH and BTC1, but they do not share the same ideals as Core, which is why their following is so small. 
My ideals line up with the software core provides. Keeping bitcoin decentralized, by allowing for me to run a node for effectively no real resource drain. I understand the concerns that over time, that could result in centralization through payment hubs and restricted block sizes, but right now that isn't the case, and we will deal with that when the time comes. If in 2025, a RPi can run 32MB blocks, and the current "Core" group still is blocking block increases, we can easily recognize this is contributing to centralization, and I believe a fork would occur allowing 32 megabyte blocks, where reasonable developers without an agenda will be contributing, just as they are today, and in my eyes, that new fork would be "Core" because it is a project. But up until now, all I've seen from Core are genius level innovations like Segwit which fixes transaction malleability, and new encoding formats like Bech32 which makes it harder to accidentally send money you don't want to. The current group in charge of the core GitHub has given me no reason to not trust them to date.

I did. Your "reorg point" is just a DoS attack at heart. 
And you can't actively mine a hard fork changing consensus, and DoS bitcoin, all at current difficulty, all with 51% of the hash power. It is mathematically ***impossible***. 
And even if you did, all you would do is accelerate the old chain to 2016 blocks even faster, with less hash power than before (you are actively running a HF remember) and now all the sudden you have minority hash power one relation to the rest of the network.

Secondly the very fact that price gouging was taking place is a testament to my point. People were willing to pay far more than they would in a typical economic situation, because the money had very little value to them. This is basic supply and demand. People weren’t concerned about the price as much as they were concerned that they didn’t even have enough to afford the price, thus, acquire the good being sold.
Ultimately, the price of the dollar tanked (locally and temporary) and the price/value of necessities went through the roof.

Lightning network is not different from Bitcoin at all. Its simply a transaction that says that you, and another party are going to lock certain coins in a channel, that you will pay each other back and forth with until you are ready to close out, and then it will publish the net amount of the final transaction.
You are dealing with bitcoin, on the bitcoin network, following the exact same rules. The difference is that it is instant and there's no limit on how many you can perform with no fees.
How you would practically use LN, *may be* different from how we currently use bitcoin, but how we currently use bitcoin can't compare with alternatives. Using bitcoin through LN would be like using Venmo, except for you never trust Venmo with your money. They just facilitate the transactions. The coins are always in your control.
LN most definitely solves the scaling issue, because most people's daily transactions don't require blockchain level security. The only current issue with LN, is that while you can prove that a middle party did or did not pay the person on the other side that you were trying to pay, there isn't a way to force them to pay. But if that was the case, you could just use a different hub and that hub would fall away as word got around they were stealing. If it is easy enough for others to start up a hub, Google isn't going to put their reputation on the line for stealing a $3 transaction for a coffee.
If you are selling a car on the other hand, you simply run an on chain transaction and pay the $5-$10 fee, which is cheaper than a wire would be.

I understand *why* they are doing it from a technical standpoint. What I'm saying is if they were *more concerned* about transaction backlog than their own profits, they wouldn't be doing it. In fact, many other pools don't practice this. 
The empty block technique is done only while verifying the new block. If you start adding transactions, all the nonces you just tested have changed their hash outcome again. 
They are *choosing* to work on empty blocks for a potential quick profit, rather than doing their job of processing and validating transactions. If everyone has the understanding of mining full blocks, then there's no competitive advantage. Full blocks is clearly not their intentions.

You can't assume that more transactions equals more fees. Back when blocks weren't full, transactions literally had fees being optional. In fact, if blocks aren't full, then you  really have no incentive to put a fee at all. 
And block size has much more to do with it than simply download speed and hard drive space. Also RAM, CPU, etc. there's quite a few bottlenecks to the scenario, each one cutting off more and more nodes. 
Controlling the block size has everything to do with the eventual lifting of the 21M cap limit. Many prominent BU figures have already alluded to this, because without fees, block reward is the only way to compensate miners. "It's not rocket science". 
And decentralization sure as hell does mean that anyone can run it. If you think that having the "right" to run a node is the same as a decentralized, peer to peer network you are fucking insane. 
You have the right to launch a fucking satellite into space, if you can afford the price to meet the standards. Are you telling me the only reason you don't have your own satellite is because you don't want one? Fucking please. Large blocks are fundamentally contrary to the goal of bitcoin. 
It doesn't matter if we disagree on the definition of decentralization though. Because 90% of the value derived from the coin comes from the fact it is a decentralized store of value with a fixed amount. And as long as the economic majority agrees that they should have the feasibility to run a node, you can fork off all day long, the value will remain on the most decentralized chain. 
What is the advantage of on chain scaling? So that we can get back to the *lightning fast transactions* of 10 minutes at the least? Are you fucking joking? No thanks, I'll stick with visa which is instant, never found anywhere I can't spend it, and I get cash back, if I'm going to have to trust a third party as I would in a big block scenario. On chain scaling can't compete with alternatives. Off chain scaling is inevitable. And decentralization will always remain priority. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:57:45
Segwit opens the blocks up to an effective 2-4MB increase. If you promote just increasing he block size anytime we run into it, you are setting a precedent for long term linear scaling, which leads to blocks that are much larger than 2MB, and will *guarantee* centralization as they grow. And with the amount of side chains being developed, many transactions have certain properties that scale quadratically, which means that block size now increases even faster. Sure your internet connection can probably handle an 8MB block now, but how about in a year when blocks are now 32MB and you need a fiber connection with a multiprocessor server to process transaction blocks in time. Now you become the constituency that is "written off" just as easily as big blockers write off those in third world countries today. In the end we end up with a faster version of ACH. Great, but we all signed up for a decentralized store/transfer of value system.
Segwit on the other hand is a solution that increases the block size within a month, and allows for better scaling options to begin to be developed. It fixes quadratic signature hashing, and still doesn't set a precedent against a block size increase in the future if needed. I would guarantee the support for a block size HF increase would be overwhelming if Segwit failed to deliver effectively. 
Kicking the can down the road isn't going to help. Off chain scaling is already happening whether that means an entirely different chain, or a level 2 technology that could *possibly* result in centralization (but likely wouldn't because the source code would be available for anyone to make a node, allowing for minimal barriers to entry and maximum competition). And even if LN flops, many other long term scaling propositions depend on malleability to be fixed before moving forward. The blocking of segwit has nothing to do with blocksize and everything to do with blocking the malleability fix that would allow for effective long term scaling. 
As bitcoin loses market share the pressure will continue to rise for miners. There is a point where they won't be profitable anymore without a scaling solution, and no one takes BU seriously. 
Block size increase without a malleability fix is just kicking the can down the road.

Going back to the original statement, if "growing" is defined as "centralizing" I'm not interested. 
I got in this for a decentralized, peer to peer, capped supply asset. 
Not a payment system that is fundamentally inferior to all other payment options by the nature of on chain scaling. 10 minute block pickup time? Is that a joke? 30 minute confirmation time? You may not think the bitcoin blockchain is a settlement layer, but it sure as hell looks like one compared to the competition. 
Meanwhile, the major roadblock to off chain, completely decentralized, trustless scaling (malleability) cannot be fixed without Segwit, and is delaying proposals that would eventually lead to such possibilities for bitcoin. As I proved above, it is not technologically possible to keep up with current day demand, on chain, and even expect it to compete with instant, free payment options like cash/venmo/visa (which I actually get cash back from). 
Scaling on chain would still entail a senders fee OR a raise of the 21M coin limit, and wouldn't result in anything faster than 10 minute payment pickup times. Sorry but I've got shit to do beyond standing at a register for 10-30 minutes, I'll just use visa. And if your propose lifting the  21M coin limit, you can fuck your self and I only assume you are a banker shill.

LN "hub" node centralization, yes. But overall number of end users running a full node going down would be a dream come true. 
If they could get 1GB blocks, where they can afford the servers, but no one else can, then they control the overall code being run on the platform, AND the hashrate. This is why it is important to keep blocks small. For the exact reason of a UASF. 
Users can't SF if they can't even afford to run a node, just like users can't HF now without changing the POW. Regardless, whenever you try to get a HF block size increase, I can almost guarantee it will be contentious and there will be a group, even if the minority, continuing to run on the small chain. I for one would wait for the value to temporarily rise on the centralized chain, because most end users are stupid/don't value decentralization, then dump my coins and go back to the small/decentralized chain, because decentralization is what I'm in this for. Not for an updated version of the banking system we already have.

This. I think people are really underestimating the potential of atomic swaps. That opens up every other chain as the transaction protocol, with bitcoin being the primary store of value. That's at least how I imagine it to be in the future.
Want privacy? Dash. Want smart contract capability? Ether. Want on chain transaction but faster/cheaper/slightly less secure than bitcoin? Litecoin.
It literally lets the value in bitcoin become spendable in any other way that is available in any alt coin with Segwit enabled. Bitcoin becomes the reserve currency and all other prices are based on the ability to buy bitcoins with it, and the demand is given by the usefulness of its features.
It leaves bitcoin's main goal to be security and decentralization with a fixed supply.

Off chain transactions make much more sense than on chain transactions when it comes to small amounts. There will always be fees for on chain, and they will continue to play a roll as reward decreases. Bitcoin on chain simply can't compete with alternatives that are faster (instant) and cheaper/free because of the very way on chain transactions are designed. There's already alts out there that are much more competitive in the fee and speed realm, than bitcoin could ever dream to be. What gives bitcoin value is its security, and its decentralization. It is a fact that as block sizes go up, decentralization goes down because less and less amount of people can run their own node. BU doesn't even deny this, they simply think that not everyone needs to run a node. So we give up that security, all so that we can go back to somewhat expensive ($.40-$.50) transactions  that take 10-30 minutes?
With level 2, txs would be instant, cheap/free, and private again, allowing Bitcoin to compete again. And you would still have the option of transacting on chain for any large transactions.

I'm not opposed to a very subtle increase in block size, with a hard limit, as long as it allows for malleability to be fixed. The problem with EC is that it is playing with fire. It turns running nodes into an arms race, which we already saw the results of that with mining. We now have 9 pools that represent 90% of the hash power. Do you expect anything different to occur if the possibility presents itself to have a majority of node control and hash control, even if it is in oligarchy form, that the parties who have already demonstrated the willingness to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on hardware to control significant portions would turn that down? EC would be the node equivalent of ASICs, which is why it is crucial for it to remain fixed at a limit that at least 2 standard divinations from the median internet connected user can run. Without it, it may as well be ACH.
Blocking Segwit has nothing to do with block size, and everything to do with forcing transactions to remain on chain, which we are already witnessing that to not be sustainable. And let's be honest; the on chain transactions are a little primitive and slower than optimal in their nature. 10 minutes minimum to be picked up in a block, another 10-20 to be confirmed the transaction goes through? Your coffee will be cold by then. Instant transactions are going to need to happen for bitcoin to scale to the level we all want it to. Because quite frankly, sending money to peers is far easier to do with Venmo right now, and I have never been anywhere that doesn't take Visa (plus I get cash back if I spend my visa). Bitcoin won't ever be able to compete with that on chain. Instant transactions are a must. And bitcoin is the bedrock layer for it. 
Miners benefit from higher transaction fees. So ask yourself from a miner's standpoint why it would make sense to have control of the block size. There's 3 outcomes:
1. You can quickly kill off the majority of nodes by ramping up block sizes until it isn't viable for smaller nodes to disagree
2. You keep block sizes smaller anyways, keeping fees higher
3. Your fees decrease substantially by making transactions cheap again, which gives you viability to argue to get rid of the 21M coin limit. 
There's really no reason 1 and 3 couldn't happen, and then 2 to happen shortly after. 
I'd honestly rather deal with the status quo and avoid that centralization. It works quite well for larger sums of money, which is frankly all that it is being used for anyways (with the exception of a few edgy people who buy back an equal amount that they spend anyways).

I would rather have a capped limit than run the risk of a floating block limit like EC wants to do. We are moving forward with SegWit. If a hard block size limit is needed after that, we can decide that later. But Segwit and off chain scaling is and should be the precedent going forward to preserve the decentralized nature of bitcoin, and the ability for an average user to run a node. That is not possible with a 250MB block.
We don't negotiate with terrorists. We will scale on chain when the time is necessary. I won't be accepting a "2MB compromise" because it sets the precedent that anything in the future requires a "compromise". Not going to happen.

I'm aware of that. That was more rhetorical. Very few people actually want EC. Most miners are using it to fillabuster. 


Incorrect. I don't use any off chain companies, and I am 100% capable of remaining that way. People are choosing to use those soluitions because off chain scaling has more benefits than on chain (instant and cheaper). Larger limit on the other hand would have nodes drop off, which by definition, is centralization. With larger blocks, people would *have* to trust centralized nodes if they can't run their own. There's some very affluent areas in the US with shitty ISPs because it is impossible to build infrastructure. My parents live an a $1.5M house in the foothills of the mountains and a 6mbps dsl connection is the only thing available. Larger blocks actually *forces* centralization, while the status quo, people are *choosing* centralization. There's a major difference. 


Ok, well cell phones were expensive too. Owning a satellite is expensive too. A trip to the moon is expensive. New technologies are expensive when there's technical limitations to be realized. So let's get level two options started with SegWit and make it cheaper. Bitcoin isn't a charity by any means. You are free to use it, but it won't ever be free to use, on chain. It's impossible, without raising the block reward. 
The miners already know that people are willing to pay higher fees. Why on earth would they give that up? Like I said, this is a fillabuster. They have a backlock of triple digit fees because that's the only option people have. with level 2, it decreases that pressure, but still allows for blocks to remain full, or at least full enough to incentivize people to pay a fee. Without full blocks, no one pays fees. Were you here before full blocks? I was. We never paid fees because the block reward was enough. That's no longer the case. Welcome the the reality of a fixed supply asset.

*On chain* transactions will always be "slower, more expensive, and less private" than altcoins. An ethereum transfer costs $.03, and is confirmed within seconds. A litecoin transfer is fully confirmed within 10 minutes (faster than a bitcoin transaction could be picked up by a block and even confirmed once) and now has lightning capabilities. Dash/Monero/Zcash all have privacy layers built into them, and as of right now, still confirm faster and cheaper than sending with bitcoin does. Ripple is pretty much instant and cheap. Increasing the capacity of on chain transactions does not improve Bitcoin's ability to compete with these alts on any of these fronts. Only capabilities unlocked with SegWit allow for Bitcoin to compete with these features. None of those coins can compete with bitcoin's security of decentralization however. Which again, decreases proportional to block sizes increasing.
If users desire these features more than simply the security of a high hash rate, than there is no reason to believe that money would flow back from the alts to bitcoin for the purposes of transferring money. And a high hash rate means nothing really if the hash rate and nodes are centralized. The entire point of a high hash rate is to make it more expensive to centralize. The encryption is actually what secures bitcoin. Without Segwit, Bitcoin is dangerously close to becoming the myspace of cryptocurrencies.

The value of bitcoin is not in it's low fees. Bitcoin never promised low fees, and in fact, it is impossible to have low fees, decentralization, and a fixed cap on amount of coins because the miners need to be compensated somehow. If you make fees low, you either have massive blocks because you need to fit all the transactions that you can into the blocks to make a profit, or you need to increase the block reward/remove the 21M coin limit. And bitcoin will never have "no fees" again anymore, because the block reward is already too small, and will only continue to get smaller. Get ready. On chain fees are the new normal. And $.30 is going to be a pipe dream even if you think you can grow the blocks indefinitely (you can't). The miners know that everyone is willing to pay a lot more than that, and they can select which transactions go into the block. Many of them have their minimum selection criteria of at least $1 now. That will not ever compete with cash/credit card transactions which are free and instant.
And finally, you cannot increase the block size indefinitely. The obvious answer to an untechnical person, for the technical problem of the "block size limit" is to "raise the limit", but that's about as simple as telling a country to "just get more debt". It doesn't work that way. There are tradeoffs. Bitcoin is decentralized, and P2P. You don't need to run a node, but if anyone tells you that you shouldn't you, need to look at them very suspiciously. Think of the ability to run a node like your second amendment. You don't need to own a gun, but the fact that you can is room enough to keep power in check. Simplify that idea with the idea of going back to the beginning of the country, where muskets were all that anyone had... It was an even playing field.
By running a node, you run the rules that dictate your money. You can run whatever rules you want. It is a voluntary economy. If you are not running a node, you are *trusting* for another node to tell you the truth about your money. You are *trusting* that they will enforce rules the way you want to. It isn't peer to peer. It is peer to central node to central node to peer. We already have that system. Wells Fargo is my node, and they will pay Visa on my behalf, and Visa will pay the shop owner on my behalf. That system sucks.
**The reason we cannot scale on chain is entirely because of technical limitations:**
Lets take just Visa level transactions from 2016.
1971 tx/s * 600 s/block * 225 bytes per tx = ***250MB blocks*** Every 10 minutes. Lets assume that you have a fiber connection (most people don't) and you can handle downloading uploading that block. After you download that, you need to store that into RAM, and validate the block, store the block, and then upload that block. And all of this needs to happen as fast as possible. If it takes longer than 10 minutes, you are now messing up the network because you are orphaning blocks. And that's the minimum. Multisignature tx's (ones that have many different inputs) scale quadratically. This means that 250MB block is more like a 1GB block. Every 10 minutes. A regular computer cannot handle that. In fact, many proponents of on chain scaling have already proposed that nodes be run from data centers. Jihan Wu suggested that it shouldn't cost more than $10k. Do you have $10k just laying around to buy the hardware, and then pay for the resources to run that node, when you get no payment from doing so? Miners do. And in fact, many have already proposed the idea of having pay-for-access nodes where you literally pay to have access to a node to use bitcoin. So add onto your already existing transaction fee. Starting to sound a lot like the current banking system. And you will still need to wait 10-30 minutes to confirm your transaction. This is just for Visa level transactions. Start adding in worldwide, fiat, wire, credit card, ACH transactions, blocks can easily ballon to over 100GB every 10 minutes. And again, multisig tx's scale quadratically.
Whether you like it or not, on-chain bitcoin absolutely sucks as a currency. It is complicated, slow, 100% traceable, and won't ever be free. Every form of fiat beats that inside and out. However, on chain bitcoin makes for an awesome digital asset, that can settle much, much faster than ACH can (10-30 minutes vs 24 hours). And it has the ability to have many, many payment layers built on top that allow for it to compete with modern day fiat infrastructure. This technology is very close to being developed on other cryptocurrencies, yet there is a stupid debate about wanting to scale on chain, when we can already show that it leads to centralization at basic levels.

You are misunderstanding the point of a reorg. It could happen in 2 days, 2 years or 200 years.

If you are using a validating node to store your private keys (recommended for sending/receiving coins) then yes it's going to take time to get up to date on the block chain, proportional to the amount of time spent idle. 
You can always export your keys to a paper wallet if you want as well. Your coins are always on the blockchain, your cold storage is just holding the private keys needed to spend them. 
Understand that whoever has those private keys can load them into a different wallet, and move your coins to a different address with different keys and you will lose access. On a paper wallet, anyone can take a picture of copy those keys.

Again, some ideas are simply illogical. I'm sorry if that hurts people's feelings. But we live in objective reality, and there is ample objective evidence to show that block sizes do in fact have an upper limit, especially with respect to the idea of remaining decentralized. Decentralization is what give's bitcoin it's value, not it's spend ability. Bitcoin currently has awful spendability compared to just about every alternative. It's decentralization and fixed supply however give it enormous value. Proponents of EC (BU) have already toyed with the idea of also increasing the block reward (thus getting rid of 21M coin limit), with the goal of keeping fees low. Again, bitcoin doesn't get it's value from being "cheap", because there are other, cheaper, faster options out there. Hell even Visa pays it's users to use them.


No, I am arguing a specific point. That it is illogical to simply "compromise" with someone just because they have an idea that is blocking your way. Especially when other options, no matter how drastic, are available.


That's not the point being argued. The point being argued is that SegWit was made available, and people are fillabustering it by using an awful idea to counter it. We aren't obliged to "compromise" because of that. And there is no real evidence to support the idea that SegWit with L2 technologies couldn't handle the volume that we need. Especially after enabling atomic transactions through lightning.

I understand the concept. But the point of this post is if they are so concerned about the backup of transactions, they wouldn't be mining empty blocks, and would instead be pointing at other pools that are (funny though, not many other pools seem to be doing so). They care more about their own profits than they do about network health. Objectively provable above.

I think either way, their existence is already factored into market forces. 
People look at bitcoin and acknowledge a total limit of 21M, acknowledge the existence of coins that have been lost, and then overall, the price accounts for supply available on the market. So you can just basically look at these coins as being permanent hodlers, where their ability to affect the price differs no more than the ability for the coins you are hodling. If they aren't available for the market as supply, then they are accounted for in the supply/demand formula of the market. 
I think investors look at the absolute cap as 21M, the current available cap, and then finally factor in a very rough guesstimate percentage of coins that will never be spent, if they factor that in at all. If anything it should be looked at as a bonus in the price, rather than depended on for any real reliability.

Basic financial principals don't always agree with you. If that interest is less than you could get a return on the money for, then basic math can show it's worth it to put the money into a higher return vehicle, and then pay the mortgage with the return. 
The trick comes when you factor in future returns. Rarely are guaranteed returns at a good rate. But then again there's no guarantee that you are going to get a good return with your house. 
Sometimes leasing a cheap apartment is the way to go. 
But to pretend that it's black and white, owning a house is a good investment is naivety at best and dangerous at worst. All financial decisions should be looked out in much more detail.

Sure. But are you really arguing that we can continue that process forever? Do you really think there's no upper limit? Remember, we aren't upgrading any other components, just making it longer and longer. 


Well the bus is sagging, and the engineers who designed the damn thing are screaming that its way over stressed. Meanwhile, the welders have practiced on a few other busses and they split in half a few times in the past months, but that wall all just because the original engineers are shit. /s
And since when does "I don't understand it, therefore it must be bad" count as a logical refute?


We won't just might be able to, we have verifiable proof of it. 


Not sure what you are alluding to there. Miners? Because Segwit fixes Asicboost, and right now fees are already massive with a back log. Why change the status quo? On the other hand, increasing block sizes is sure to drop transaction costs down tremendously. And why wouldn't the miners love a monopoly of hashing *and* nodes? Come on man, you're smarter than that. 


It's not normal for people to have that capital funding around to start something that naturally runs at a loss. 


Again "I don't understand therefore bad" is just dumb. Stop. 


Welcome to capitalism, where there are no shortages if you are willing to pay enough ;) it's not perfect but it sure beats bread lines. 
And just because it doesn't solve it all we shouldn't implement it at all?

There's more to centralization and the blocksize than just storage capacity. Ram, CPU, and bandwidth also play a role, and are all choke points. There's no logical reason to increase centralization when bitcoin can scale on a L2 level.

Anything where the fee of $.5 to $1 substantially affects it's usability can and should be considered a "micro transaction" in the context of bitcoin. The reason this should be held true, is because in the context of any larger transactions ($100+), the fee of $.50 to $1 is substantially less than any other method available all things held equal.
While everyone would prefer to have your coffee transaction on the blockchain, we now realize that on chain transactions have current technological limitations, and we can't fit everybody's coffee sized transaction on the blockchain, cheaply, while still remaining a decentralized nature. Pick 2, because you can't have all three. With layer 2 technologies like LN, you can make trestles transactions, peer to peer, and an intermediate party can bundle all of those transactions up into one paying the same fee, keeping the difference for themselves. We may see on chain transactions having a $4/$5 fee, but if that is the case, the off chain transaction volume would be off the chart and you would see L2 suppliers raking in cash compared to the $4/$5 fee. And of course, the option still remains to pay the $4/$5 fee for any transaction that you wish to pay it for, if you want the security of an on chain transaction.
But chances are, you are going to want to be buying your "micro transaction" level stuff off chain, where prying eyes can't track your money from paycheck to POS anyways. There's really no plus side to having your coffee transaction on chain.

Would you pay $100? I probably wouldn't. At that point, there will be people working their way to other coins, because bitcoin's features aren't worth that much to people. There's a market price. Bitcoin is a free market system, built on free market principles. You can feel free to create another coin that has "reasonable fees", but we are't going to artificially fix bitcoin's. With Segwit, second level technologies are faster that will be instant, and cheap/free, and the operators of those technologies will make money on the difference between what they collect and what they pay for a blockchain transaction.

The answer to that question is "The car will bring you from point A to point B, but they will not fly." Sure it doesn't answer your questions as to how they will *fly* there, but the question is fundamentally flawed to begin with because cars don't *fly*.
The way lightning network would work would be more similar to a web browser. I can't help you if that doesn't fit into the framework of your question, but we live in objective reality and thats just the way things are.
tl;dr- you would pay someone through a service that looks and works exactly like something like venmo but is entirely decentralized. It will be instant and very very cheap if not free.

If you aren't running a node you aren't running bitcoin, by literal definition of the protocol.
And you don't have a choice if miners control the block size. If you want to spend bitcoin, you need to play by the nodes rules at that point. We already have that system. My node is called Wells Fargo, and they are assholes. 
If miners control the nodes, what's to stop them from increasing the block reward/limiting the coin cap? The general public seems to be ok with it from a fiat standpoint. 
The economics are very simple. Bitcoin has a demand because it is decentralized and no one can control it. It is working perfectly with that right now. Segwit scales without sacrificing that. But if you want to have miner controlled block sizes, please do, fork off. Because if you want that and my money to follow, I can 100% guarantee you that it won't happen. You can fork off whenever you want. There's nothing stopping you. But you don't control my coins, and I will be dumping those miner controlled coins, because they are worthless to me.

The difference is by printing more fiat you dilute the amount of fiat out there. There has always been 21*10^12 bits out there, and if you own one coin, you also own 1*10^6 bits.

Can you clarify your question? Nodes are relatively passive when it comes to the ecosystem. They simply validate the rules they choose to run. And those rules can be anything. If you want to run a node that accepts more than 21M coins, that is your choice. 
The problem with running a node with different rules is that your rules either need to conform to the rest of the economic majority's rules, or you are on your own chain. 
The reason a UASF is possible with nodes is because a significant portion of the nodes are deciding to draw a line in the sand and enforce a rule (Segwit). By doing so, they are splitting from the original chain's rules. But because Segwit is a SF, and Segwit blocks still apply to the rules of the legacy chain, then legacy nodes will still receive the UASF blocks, and if they become the chain with the longest POW, their legacy node will recognize the UASF as the "true chain" by their own rules, and get rid of the legacy chain. 
But to answer your question, nodes do nothing but enforce their own rules. And if your rules are on a chain with economic demand, your chain is worth some money. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:22:23
They are getting pricey, because there's a massive increase in volume, blocks are full, and the fee market hasn't reached its market rate yet. Spending with multiple inputs/outputs is going to get pricey quickly. Hopefully Segwit being activated on 8/1/17 will open the door to reasonable scaling to make fees reasonable again. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:23:08


Not even close to a valid comparison. A real comparison would be something more similar to "imagine we run all of our mechanical processes on something called *fossil fuels* but because we are using them up at a rate so much higher than they can physically be created, we are running out. We have two options. Just open up the flood gates and tell everyone to use as much as they can while it is still available, or we can use that remaining energy to find alternatives that we can scale better".
It is not a fact of *wanting* to stay small. It is a factor of *needing* to remain small by physical and technical limitations that exist. If you want fast and cheap, go to a bank. I want decentralized. That's what bitcoin is for, and you will never convince me to give up that decentralization in exchange for the other two.
Let's do a little objective math with *bitcoin* rather than *burgers* shall we?
[Visa and mastercard alone process 1971 transactions per second]( I think we can all agree this is an acceptable scaling goal yes?
So 1971 transactions per second x ~600 seconds per block = 1,182,600 transactions per block.
Now lets use the most common, but also most simple and smallest type transaction, the one input, two output, payee and change transaction, that is almost always 225 bytes. This is about as small as they practically get unless you are sending all the money to a new address. They only get larger from here. In fact, multisig transactions scale quadratically...
225 bytes x 1,182,600 transactions /1024 (bytes/kb) / 1024 (kb/mb) = 253 MB per block. Every ten minutes. You not only need to download that, you need to store that, and you need to load it into RAM, and have your computer hash it in SHA256 and then forward it if it is valid, all within 10 minutes. Think you can handle that? By the way, thats about 1TB of data a month through your residential plan. And that's just MasterCard and Visa. Wait till we throw in cash, ACH, and wire transfers for the existing population, and the 2B unbanked people out there.
Starting centralize already.
Now lets pretend you can handle that (you can't). Well, you are now in an arms race with the Asian miners who have demonstrably spent hundreds of millions of dollars in hardware to gain control of the network. They have millions of dollars in cashflow every month. You don't get squat for running a node. Why should you run one?
Very quickly we devolve into a system that is literally no different from the systems we have today. Want to use bitcoin? Find a node (bank) that you can trust to manage your account.
It fundamentally runs contrary to bitcoin.
So yes, just like you don't have wings and cannot fly, it is objectively impossible to scale *on chain* in a non centralized manner. And centralization is not acceptable. Plain and simple.
Even if we could, it would be for what? To end up with fees, at least 10 minute transaction times, increased number of orphaned blocks, liquidity volatility, etc. etc.? Those things are fundamental to the bitcoin blockchain. Scaling on chain only makes it worse. You think it could ever compete with cash if you have a fee to pay, had to wait 20-30 minutes, *and* it was centrally controlled? Dream on.
If you have any better ideas, please let us know.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:31:59
It does so more rapidly than you think. 
In order to handle even a quarter of just visa and MasterCard transaction daily volume, blocks would need to be over 60MB or 9GB a day. Try running node that can keep up with that. Off chain scaling is inevitable, and the time is now.
And yes, transaction fees and block reward are inversely proportional to miner compensation. You can't have a low block reward, and not full blocks (meaning no one would use fees). How do you expect to compensate the miners? Please do outline your compensation plan.

Segwit fixes it, Extension blocks fixes it, hell even the proposed [BIP]( that only fixes that single issue would fix it.
Funny how Bitmain doesn't support any of that.
Empty/smaller blocks is also a sign of Asicboost. Funny how bitmain has a substantially higher amount of empty blocks mined than any other pool.
BU nodes went down for like what the 4th/5th time in 2 months, yet Bitmain's hash power was as strong as ever during those times. Seems like they aren't even running BU, they are just signalling for it to block Segwit (which hmmm, blocks ASICBOOST).

Well if you are proposing 214 MB blocks (at least, which would put it just below current number of credit card transactions only... i.e. no cash, checks, wiring transactions), every 10 minutes, you are proposing:
214 MB x 6 blocks per hour x 24 hours in a day = 30 GB per day
Most residential data plans include somewhere around a 250GB per month cap, or at the very least you are being watched. 
30GB per day, you are looking at about 30GBx365days/1024MB/TB= *10.7 TB per year*. 
I can get a 4 TB hard drive for about $80, so about $214.50 of storage costs a year. Plus electricity to run those drives. 
And then we haven't even looked at the cost of actually validating the blocks... i.e. Literally the only purpose of running a node. You have to not only download your block in less than 10 minutes, but load it into RAM, and hash the entire block to ensure the block hash is valid. Have fun doing that in the background of your computer. The power to run a CPU that powerful again is pretty damn expensive. 
So ya, you are actually proposing data center level infrastructure by scaling linearly. And that's the most basic scenario. When multisig transactions appear more and more (we are already seeing them) now we scale quadratically. So really those 214 MB blocks are closer to 512MB or even 1 GB. Remember that's just for credit card levels of transactions with some side chains. We still need room for transactions currently taking place with cash, and wire transfers and ACH. And to top it all off, it results in what? A transaction that anyone can track your spending habits, that takes 10 minutes at the minimum to actually spend?
Long story short, increasing the block limit isn't "scaling" any more than copying and pasting code rather than looping is scaling. It is simply delaying the issue. No one is saying 1MB block size forever and ever. But most people are saying that a substantial drop off in nodes isn't acceptable, and off chain scaling is needed. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:56:22

Well, the best option I have right now is the bitpay debit card where I could immediately convert to usd and pay with Visa. It also allows cash back too, so I could go the the grocery story and convert back into cash if I wanted to. 
My logic is that I'd rather have the money accumulate in BTC rather than USD. I can always convert back into USD fairly easily if I need it to cover expenses, and I have my safety net account which could bridge the time gap.
I guess more what I'm concerned about is neglecting an accelerated pay off of my car, and the possibility that a majority of my paycheck would be subject to a zero value in the future.

It doesn't increase the base block size which is the concept. On chain scaling is a much worse option for scaling to mass adoption levels of transactions. Credit card level transactions alone on chain would be 250MB at the absolute minimum. Segwit with LN and atomic transactions could handle almost to that level with zero change in the base block size.

There's absolutely no empirical evidence that we need a 2MB block if we have Segwit. Literally zero. In fact, basic math can show that 2MB blocks doesn't even scratch the surface for the volume that we are talking about. Today's Visa level transactions *alone* would require a *minimum* of 250MB blocks. For all we know, Segwit, LN, and atomic transactions is more than enough to deal with the backlog. But we *do* know that we can't fix this without off chain scaling. Don't fix shit that isn't broken. 
We will move forward with BIP148 to activate Segwit immediately, and we will look into a 2MB HF when it is needed. There is not fucking "compromise" because this isn't a political decision. This is a fucking technical project with objectively correct answers. We know that larger blocks increase node requirements and increase centralization. If there is no reason to do it, we aren't going to do it and set a precedent that whenever we need a SF we have to centralize even more. 
Miners can either tag along or fork off, but 8/1/17 we are moving forward with Segwit. We will look into the need for a 2MB HF thereafter if needed.

Fair enough. But no one care's about ideologies in a free market. People do what benefits them. Which is why ETH is the only one that is even talked about today.


Again, "Bitcoin" is whatever users decide Bitcoin is. Just like "what is internet?" Is it no longer internet because we don't use dial up?


Which is why BIP148 is a SF.


As BIP148 continues to rise, there will be a forcing of the hands. Miners love the status quo. Nothing is going to happen until it has to. When forced with making a decision, they are going to go with the clearly better option which is Segwit, even if they don't want to. It is clear that it is best for the long term value of the coin, even if it affects their short term profits they are making from ATH fees at the moment. They know that isn't sustainable forever.

Bitcoin has value for its decentralization. It is perfectly decentralized right now. Segwit makes it better while retaining decentralization.  But if you give up that decentralization for lower fees, you're a fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:00:50
Which is why Segwit alone needs to happen without a "compromise", because miners would love node centralization. A "compromise" sets a precedent that we give more and more any time we want anything. Miners would love node centralization. Node centralization means that UASF is less and less likely. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:22:13
I like this answer. Decentralization first. The value will always follow because of that. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. Bitcoin is not just another payment platform.

@_date: 2017-05-28 14:05:32
Yes. Your wallet only holds the keys to the bitcoins. The coins don't actually really exist any more than numbers on a scoreboard exist. They exist in the blockchain, which is "in the cloud".
So when the chain splits, there will be two chains. Both will say that there are X coins in Y Location that can be spent with Z key. Because the Y Location is a function of the Z key, the Z key will work on both chains. 
Now if you try to spend your coins, it will depend on the node that electrum is connected to, and the node on the receiving end, in terms of which coins on which chain will be spent.

Realistically, I think most corporate systems have everything backed up, and most users probably have important files in multiple locations naturally, given the move to cloud oriented storage. 
I know I for one wouldn't necessarily care if I got infected because most of my important files are either emailed to or from me in some sort or another (just go redownload it from email server), in some cloud service like Dropbox/iCloud, and or on another computer/flash drive somewhere. If I think of my daily use of computers, it is either internet/cloud centric or at work where things are substantially backed up.

Having first hand experience with MSBs, the registration is an absolute fucking joke. Basically, you add your name and contact information to their database, which adds it to the bottom of an excel spreadsheet, that puts you on FinCENs radar. 
It doesn't require you to prove just about anything. They collect a fee, and you get a certificate that says you are "registered". It's government bureaucracy 101. Basically, you agree to follow their AML procedures, so if they find out you aren't complying, they can just point to how you agreed to do so, and have all your contact information to teach you down. 
Tl;dr- MSB registration is a joke, means nothing, and can be used to fraudulently represent being vetted.

Well Bitmain is sub 20% hashpower, so if they are the only ones left (there's no evidence that Asicboost is being utilized by anyone else), then the community could easily UASF at that point and Bitmain would literally be forced to jump over or die. While mining is definitely an oligarchy at the moment, fortunately is is very far from a monopoly (pure hash power monopoly that is). 
I think as market share continues to decrease, and off chain scaling becomes more and more feasible (if litecoin cracks LN, it's game over for BU), then slowly but surely you will see smaller pools with no real advantage to fillabustering to begin to jump over. But in the current state, there's no reason to support a protocol upgrade that directly cuts into your profits no matter who you support. Transaction fees going up is great for miners.

That's a sugar coated version of saying "yes we have to answer to the public, but we operate 100% independently."






No it is not. In fact, much of it is owned by foreign interests. 
And even if it was a government entity, working on behalf of the people, again, every recorded economic catastrophe is a direct result of central bank intervention. The military is a government entity as well, but that doesn't mean they are infallible, and always do the will of the people.

Ok, let's talk about the volume of credit card transactions:
[1971 tx per sec]( x 600s per block x 225 bytes (minimum) per tx = ***253MB*** per block at the minimum (that's one in two out transactions and not including quadratically scaling miltisigs. And just credit card levels alone). Is that your proposal? LN can't handle *all* of CC level capacity, we just scale on chain?
Easy scenario: 
Google Chrome starts a lightning hub. I connect a payment channel to google chrome. I can now pay anyone connected to chrome's network, for as long as I have that payment channel open. It may be semi trust, but for small, daily transactions, it's not like you need blockchain security. If I'm selling a car, ya we are sitting for 60 minutes for all confirmations to roll in, and I'm paying the $10 fee for an on chain transaction. 
Google/Facebook can sell your purchasing data, or I'm sure they'll be pay by the transaction for a penny or so, or subscription based models. You just open payment channels like you would add a Linux repo. Such a system is no more complicated than programming an exchange. I'm sure after a short period of time, an open source lightning hub software opens and anyone could start one amongst their friends, or for any other reason.

Really? "Scaling" is different from just increasing capacity. "Scaling" is a special term used in development that addresses efficiencies and capacity issues in the long term. For example if you have a list of random numbers, and you want to sort the list from smallest to largest, some algorithms are going to be much, much, faster and more efficient than other algorithms. "Scaling" refers to choosing that best algorithm.
Let's say that we could just scale on chain.
[Visa and mastercard alone process 1971 transactions per second]( I think we can all agree this is an acceptable scaling goal yes?
So 1971 transactions per second x ~600 seconds per block = 1,182,600 transactions per block.
Now lets use the most common, but also most simple and smallest type transaction, the one input, two output, payee and change transaction, that is almost always 225 bytes. This is about as small as they practically get unless you are sending all the money to a new address. They only get larger from here. In fact, multisig transactions scale quadratically...
225 bytes x 1,182,600 transactions /1024 (bytes/kb) / 1024 (kb/mb) = 253 MB per block. Every ten minutes.
You not only need to download that, you need to store that, and you need to load it into RAM, and have your computer hash it in SHA256 and then forward it if it is valid, all within 10 minutes. Think you can handle that? By the way, thats about 1TB of data a month through your residential plan. And that's just MasterCard and Visa. Wait till we throw in cash, ACH, and wire transfers for the existing population, and the 2B unbanked people out there. And that is the best case scenario. Many transactions, especially those with increased inputs and outputs, are much, much larger than 225 bytes.
Think you can handle that? Because if not, there's definitely some miners in china who would *love* to control the majority of nodes as well. Don't worry, you can just *trust* that their node is telling you the truth. We already have that system. My "node" is called "Wells Fargo". They are assholes.
Scaling will need to happen off chain. Now is that time. A solution is ready to go that would enable all that innovation to happen. With off chain scaling, $30 transaction fees would be nothing compared to the money lighting node runners would get in microtranaction fees ($.005/transactions for instant transactions, completely trustless).
What do you want to go back to? 10 minutes to get picked up in a block? with 250MB blocks, you can bet there's going to be more orphaned blocks, so waiting at least 30 minutes to ensure you are confirmed? That coffee is cold by then buddy. By the way, you think miners are just going to roll over and let you get away with a low fee? Please, what makes you think the miners are on your side buddy?

You have demonstrated absolutely zero competence up until this point, other than calling questionable credentials into play. Literally nothing you have said follows a logical train of thought. You are making unfounded claims, and then refusing to refute my points logically, yet I "have no idea what I'm talking about"? Lol. Sure bro. 


Really? Because the market seems to agree with me. All time highs today. Seems small blocks and decentralization is in higher market demand for something like ripple. 


Well fuck you too &amp;lt;3. I'm here to make/keep my money, not hand it over to Chinese little peckers. I'm not here to make friends. 


A commodity is not a business. That's fucking absurd. Once again you demonstrate a lack of the competence to actually have the credentials you claim. A service industry revolves around commodities. Trust me, oil and gas does exactly this. We take a raw product (crude oil/bitcoin blockchain) and make usable products from it (ethylene/end user services for using bitcoin). This is no different from the internet. Sure there's ISPs, and there's web browsers, and web development companies and SEO, but they all service a decentralized asset that we know as the internet. 


Cool, we are on the same page. 


No, their services are a business, not the protocol. The protocol doesn't care how or why blocks are made, as long as they meet the defined rules. Again, companies are utilizing a public asset, in order to make money. Not the other way around. 


Hmmmm, my engineering degree and MBA would beg to differ, but sure. 


No, it proves, unequivocally, that it is not possible to scale on chain, and retain a raspberry pi as a node. And you may disagree with that concept, but again, the market disagrees with you. 


Sure, but it also doesn't require a "12tb laptop, and a 1gbps" connection. In fact, I have a BitTorrent client running on a raspberry pi. The feasibility to do so is what makes it decentralized. I don't think *you* understand what decentralized means. If it becomes unfeasible for the majority of the world population to run a node, then it is not decentralized. Anyone in the world can run a BitTorrent node with minimal hardware. That is the level we are going for. 


Because the feasibility for someone anywhere in the world to run a node for minimal monthly cost is just fucking insane. But hey, let's minimize the number of nodes and end up with a centralized but slower than ripple and more expensive blockchain! Yay, we did it guys! Too bad that even best case scenario it is still slower and more expensive than other alts currently available. And we lost our primary value of decentralization. We did it guys! We killed the unkillable currency! 


What are you even talking about? No? Yes? I feel violated by such a stupid question. 


So your goal is to have more than one node on a network and call it decentralized? Well hell, by your definition, ACH is decentralized. Pack it up guys. We're through here. 


Again, your claim, your burden of proof. 


Hahaha did ***you*** read it?! That's ***PER DAY***.:
"37 billion transactions in 2008" (it was 62 last year) "or an avg of 100 million transactions per day". "Let's say 1kb per transaction". 1e8tx x 1kb /1024 kb/mb /1024 mb/gb = 95gb *per day*. Jesus Christ! You're a fucking programmer and can't do math? 95gb x 365 / 1024 = 33 T per year. Looks like you're gonna need more laptops bud. 
In fact, to fit 32B transactions per year in 100GB, you are saying each transaction would be just over 3 bytes. You sure you run an exchange?
And even more hilarious: 253MB (my number) x 6 blocks an hour x 24 hours /1024 = 35 GB per day. So I guess I am pretty far off. My bad. 


So it's impossible for bitcoin to attract the attention and consume that level of volume in the very near future? Ok, I guess I'm the clownshoe. 


The insanity of literally centralizing an asset that only has value because of its decentralized nature. Once again, I forward you to ripple. It's everything you are looking for. 


Thanks &amp;lt;3. 


No, the highest being proposed is no hard limit, EC, or literally infinity. Going with EC sets a precedent for on chain scaling, which would very quickly turn into block sizes that big.

Are you high? When the miners, who have a monopoly on mining hardware, decide they want to have a monopoly on nodes, they simply start mining massive blocks. There has already been studies to show that 4MB is the current limit for the vast majority of nodes. BU has already indicated their intent for "data center" nodes. Current Visa level transactions alone are a minimum of 250MB blocks. Sorry, if that's what you want you are going to need to fork off because I'll gladly pay $20 fees for a decentralized store of value that I alone can validate. 


Incorrect again. You really can't just make claims with no evidence to support them. 


The fundamental part of bitcoin is "P2P" but the entire BU side is spouting off how now everyone needs to run a node... how is bitcoin P2P if you aren't running a node. Low fees forever were never promised. Bitcoin isn't a charity.

Did you just pull that number out of your ass? Because that doesn't cut it. 
Let's assume that the average amount miners expect for a block is 16 BTC. You can assume that 12.5 of that is from the block reward (but that will half in 3.5 years, and again in 4 and again and again). So we are left with 3.5 btc. Let's assume we can get 10 times the volume we are currently getting with 1MB blocks. You can't, because multisig nature transactions scale quadratically, but let's just assume that for a minute. Average number of tx/block is about 500 give or take. So now we are looking at 5000 tx with just a block size increase. 7.5/5000 tx = .0007 BTC, @ $1800 is about $1.26 cents per transaction. Assuming blocks are full. And we really can't even assume that, so if blocks aren't full, the miners are getting shafted (no pun intended). Segwit allows for L2 transactions, like LN, which would decrease on chain transactions, so there's really no reason to pay a fee on chain. Especially when visa/Venmo is faster and cheaper (Visa actually pays me).
That leaves the idea of a lift of the 21M coin limit. Do you really want that? Because you either get cheap transactions with a bigger block reward (no more limit... it has already been alluded to.) or pay for a transaction on chain. 
Or you can just scale off chain, and let people who settle on chain pay the fee. And transactions are instant. That's impossible on chain.

It's a lot harder to do than just talking about it. Hence why there's thousands of alts but only one bitcoin.

Now you copy that spreadsheet into another computer. You and your coworker work on your own respective files of the same ledger. Your changes are not reflected in his file and his are not in yours. 
Over time these documents are going to look different. Because there are 2^160 accounts, many are going to be unchanged between both chains. But those people who spend will have spent on one or the other chain, and it wouldn't be reflected in the other.

Totally agree, but I heard of one of these a while back when it got implemented into a transmission (torrenting program) release, and it actually encrypted all external drives and network drives too. So if the network drive was attached, any folder they had write access too was fucked. The question is how they back up the servers? If it is RAID, is it a situation where you are writing over the unencrypted version with the encrypted version?
It's a tricky situation. Definitely never worth paying the hacker... but making sure the server is safe from being overwritten, while also keeping it easily accessible for the less technically savvy.

It's working quite well actually. I sent $6k worth of transactions, in 30 minutes, for less than $5 total yesterday. No one questioned me. No one asked me where/why I was sending it. No one can steal the thousands I have stored away. 
Tell me, do you know of another system that can do that?
And FYI, Roger Ver has an active interest in pumping alt coins and spending money on bogus transactions with no fee. If you send a reasonable fee (really $1.50 for the most secure network in the planet isn't bad) your transaction goes through first block. 
If you trade all of that security for some cheap/fast transactions, I guarantee you Visa/Venmo is faster and easier for now. And if Segwit gets implemented, more things can be done to *actually* scale. 
It will get better with time. But they can't move forward without the changes Segwit brings. And BU kills the decentralization.

A node is any bitcoin client that downloads the full blockchain. It is running the bitcoin protocol as originally intended. "Lightweight wallets" are not nodes and depend on nodes to operate 100% trust less.
A miner is simply a special type of node with specialized computing power to enable it it calculate blocks faster. But the nodes don't "pass the transactions on to the miners" per se. All nodes, miners or non miners, will distribute new transactions to all other nodes, and they add up in the "mempool". 
The primary purpose of running a full node is to verify that the block published to the network is a valid block. They receive a new block, and use the nonce and block data to calculate out the hash and check that it follows the rules. That's it. 
A UASF basically just says that any node running the UASF won't count any block that isn't flagging for Segwit as a not valid block, from a certain date onward. It's basically saying "ok, we are moving on without you, feel free to join us, but we aren't waiting for you". It's relatively dangerous because without enough mining power, the minority chain could easily be attacked. It would cause a contentious split. 
The purpose of a UASF is more to pressure the miners into switching. If the UASF has majority hash power, and the bulk of the users wants to use it, then any minor on the non UASF chain will be essentially mining useless blocks. Blocks are expensive to mine, so miners want to mine blocks that are actually going to be worth something. If a UASF looks like it would succeed, it would force miners to make the decision. Most would likely jump on board because in the end they are here to make money. 
Tl;dr- The UASF just accelerates the process by putting pressure on the miners.

So, by voting with coins, which Ver has thousands of, on Ver's own website, that is fact? Ok buddy. You do know that just because wealth is concentrated, doesn't mean that represents the economic majority as a population. The coin dance statistics are based off of public statements of user services either announcing or denouncing certain platforms. BU is only supported by a few mining pools. Almost half of user services explicitly state they are pro Segwit, and 29% are explicit against BU. How is that not representative of what their users want?
And I'm perfectly aware of the effects of BIP148. The miners know they are on the losing side of the argument, but the status quo is making them rich so they have no incentive to switch. BIP148 provides that incentive, because we are moving on without them.

That's not necessarily true and more based on conjecture. And how would the government regulate the LN if anyone can start up a lightning hub?
With LN, atomic transactions become possible, opening up all Segwit enabled alts as a payment option for bitcoin. I think bitcoin returns to its core purpose, a decentralized, basic, store and transfer of value. All other alts become payment options with bells and whistles. 
And people spend $10-15 per transfer today for sending large amounts. It's highly unlikely that fees would get any higher than that for on chain transactions. Hardly unusable for the average user. Sending money on the most secure/decentralized blockchain in the world is a scarce resource, and there's a price. Bitcoin isn't and never was a charity. And if it came to high tax fees or centralization, I would go for high tax fees everytime.

Is a trustless bitcoin network now only for those fortunate enough to live in a place where infrastructure is easy to setup? Or are you saying they now have to trust someone else's node? Doesn't work too well for your Africa narrative. Small blocks however, allow anyone to run their own node, and in due time (like a year a most) with malleability fixed would have ample off chain scaling solutions that would make it faster and cheaper than on chain could ever pretend to be. 
Please enlighten us all. How do you expect to compensate the miners for on chain transactions if fees are low?

From my understanding, the basic payment channel starts with a "transaction" contract, locking up the maximum amount of money to be paid, by both parties. Your requires either your signature or a time lapse to expire, and theirs requires the same of them. Basically, you open up a side tunnel that you can send money back and forth, off chain, and "recreate" a new contract with every transaction, off chain, every time decreasing the amount of time on that time lapse. If at any point, you want to "cash out", you simply publish that finishing transaction to the chain. Either party can close the channel at any time and get the most current state (as if you were doing transactions on chain). This is already possible today. There are ample videos of people doing this today in litecoin and the bitcoin testnet. 
Things get really interesting when you want to introduce "hubs". Through signatures and other encryption trickery, it is provably possible to pay someone through a trustless third party. It's a little above eli5 level and frankly still throughs me for a loop, but you can accept that it is as provable as using bitcoin in and of itself is. 
The main idea, is if I am a central "hub" processor, and many different parties interact through me, then I can effectively settle many amounts off chain, through equalizing all amounts. If you pay me $5 but Bill wants to send you $10, I can effectively just take Bill's $5 and pay you $5. Because everyone has their own trustless contract, you never actually have to trust me. The only limit to this is theoretically however much I am capable of "fronting" for these transactions (remember *both* parties have to lock up the amount. So if I sell you a coffee, you *and* I both lock up $5). Something, something 6 degrees to Kevin Bacon and this network effect can very quickly reach a wide network with very few hubs. 
The way I imagine it in my head is we would have various "services" that could act as these hubs (end user interface like a wallet software or an internet browser) and they would have a lot of money to front for these services. They simply make all these transactions happen off chain, through LN so they have no liability and you still have 100% control of your money, and they simply charge a penny or so per transaction (if that, really however they want to setup their revenue structure) and then they would pay the actual on chain cost. So if I ran a hub, I'm ok "fronting" 100BTC worth of transactions if it means that I'm going to be able to get $.01 for 100,000+ transactions, and I pay $4 for "settling" transaction fee on chain. It can only work with the bedrock bitcoin network there, and all transactions would be taking place with bitcoin. Also, it stays fundamental that anyone is capable of running a transaction on chain if they deem they want to, simply by paying the going rate for an on chain transaction. You won't ever be "forced" to use LN if you don't want to. You always have the option to use on chain, but there's a cost for using the most secure payment channel on the planet. The main holdup with this is that no one to date has perfected these "trustless middlemen" type transactions. I firmly believe that given a few more months of development, litecoin will crack this and the solution will be implemented into bitcoin. 
This is my general understanding from what I have read from many online resources. Please feel free to point out where my technicals are wrong. 
That being said, here's my personal opinion on the topic:
I think this is a monumental step in bitcoin for a few reasons:
1. Instant transactions just like cash. Let's face it, bitcoin UX currently blows, with or without full blocks. 10 minutes for a confirmed transaction, 20-30 to ensure not being orphaned, really can't compete with venmo/visa. If it instant, it does everything Venmo/visa can do, but you control your money at all times which is crucial. On chain scaling only puts us back to waiting 10 minutes for a confirmation, or accepting that the transaction could be double spent in the meantime. 
2. Massive off chain scaling. Like it or not, there are technical limitations to onchain scaling. It is simply not feasible to maintain small blocks (and by direct correlation decentralization) and scale to visa like volumes chain. No more than it is for you to time travel. By limiting the on chain transactions to mostly settling, you decrease the volume substantially. 
3. A layer of security. Bitcoin is hardly anonymous anymore. Most inlets into this ecosystem require some sort of ID and even ATMs have cameras on them. There's already software out there to track bitcoin, and it has already lead to arrests of people. It's not easy, but it's very doable to track your spending if someone dedicates the effort. With lightning network, because all the on chain transactions are settlements, you don't know who's money belongs to who, just that money from all these people went in, and all these accounts were updated to the new amounts. It adds a layer of abstraction and bitcoin becomes private again. 
4. Ease of end user use. Like it or not bitcoin is still complicated to get into. And use. Part of that is because a lot of uber geeks are developing for regular geeks, and the only real options for normal people are trusted third parties. Hence why Coinbase does so well. It is "easy"/attractive to use, but you place enormous trust in them. With "hub" software, it would be no different from you firing up google chrome or Mozilla Firefox or safari. They would all interact with each other accordingly, all would have their pros and cons, but ultimately, you would be in control of your money and keys at all times due to the nature of lightning network.
If we truly want bitcoin to be a "peer to peer cash system", a second layer needs to happen. Without instant transactions, bitcoin will never be cash. And sending things to 34 character cryptographic addresses is not "grandma" level friendly. In order for bitcoin to be "digital cash" it needs to be as easy to use, as fast, and as private as me handing over a fiat bill to someone. And because of the nature of onchain scaling, that is fundamentally impossible for bitcoin to do purely on chain. LN is as natural to bitcoin as  the www was to tcp/ip. It adds a layer of abstraction to the fundamental technology that makes it usable for everyone, while retaining the benefits of the bedrock technology.

Do you know what a ponzi scheme is?
It is a layered investment scheme, with promises of great returns, where the con man pays the first "investors" with the "investments" from the newcoming "investors". When there's no more "investors" the system collapses. 
Bitcoin is a digital asset. There's no promise of an increase in price. What it does promise, is that there is a fixed supply. That's it. So as long as there is a demand for it, and the supply is predictable, there's a value for it. The reason the price keeps increasing is because people are recognizing the utility of a decentralized, fixed supply asset. That's all. 
Bitcoin doesn't ever remotely resemble a Ponzi scheme.

Sure but that doesn't ignore the idea that allocation of capital is a value creating activity, and is fundamental to economic growth. 
Interest doesn't always come from someone else losing money. Most of the time it comes from using the money to allow for productive actions to take place in the first place. 
Interest isn't going to disappear just because bitcoin is around. The only thing bitcoin changes is that you have the choice to store your money outside of a system that either inflates the value out of your savings, or gambles with it. That just makes investing more honest.

Bitcoin was never initially about cheap instant transactions. Some naive idealists may have said it would be, but it is fundamentally impossible for bitcoin on chain to be cheap and instant. 
Distributed ledgers need to distribute quickly. That means block sizes need to be small enough to download process and reupload all within 10 minutes. Small blocks mean less tx, which means higher fees. 
Miners need to be compensated. The block reward is already low, and will continue to get lower. Fees won't ever go away. There will always be a fee for on chain transactions, and it will always be substantially more than cash/credit transactions.
Bitcoin on chain never was and can never be instant. Sorry. That fundamentally goes against how bitcoin works. At the minimum, we need to wait to be picked up in a block, which takes roughly 10 minutes even with empty blocks. Then, because of the possibility of orphaned blocks, it is recommended that you wait for 2 more confirmations, 6 if it is an important transactions. 0 confirmation transactions were never, and still are never, and will never be safe. This is fundamental to bitcoin. 
**On chain transactions can never be instant and they will never be free/cheap if you wish to have even relative decentralization. The only way to go back to the $.05 fee days is to have data center style nodes, which isn't ok.**
I'd rather have bitcoin be digital gold than digital cash if that is the case. At least until internet infrastructure catches up and large blocks are viable for the average person run a node with large blocks.

By the time you can get to the hardware levels to run a node, it will be well past those levels again.
To reach today's Visa and MasterCard volumes alone, without the quadratic scaling of multisig transactions, and assuming the smallest possible transactions, block sizes are at *least* 250MB, probably upwards of 1GB. That's not even including replacing cash transactions, ACH, wire transactions, or any side chains.
[1917 transactions per second]( x 600 sec per block x 225 bytes per transaction /1024 bytes/kb / 1024 kb/mb = 246MB
That's for the smallest, single in, two out transactions. Of just visa and mastercard volumes of current day levels. Imagine adding in cash, ACH, wires, and 2B more unbanked people. It isn't feasible for you to ever catch up. Your "node" will be your bank.
There *may* be room for a megabyte more of space left to scale on chain, but if you want to remain decentralized, we need to scale off chain. Its a technological reality that needs to be realized. Just like it isn't technically feasible for your computer to cycle through and crack satoshi's wallet. There's technical limitations that just cannot be bypassed or ignored.

Again, irrelavant to the conversation. The conversation is that it is illogical to simply "compromise" with any idea that anyone comes up with. EC is a very bad idea and deserves no "compromise".


Again, see the above for reason to not "compromise". If we Segwit, and *then* come to the conclusion of a 2MB hard fork, that's a different situation. But Segwit needs to come first if it's only opposition is EC.


You can make a chain with the Bitcoin genesis block and a new PoW, but you can't be sure from this vantage point that your chain will be Bitcoin or will have an economic majority.

There's no real evidence to say it wouldn't solve the scaling problem, at least for current levels. With atomic transactions, every other side chain now becomes an avenue of transaction.

Because of the way a soft fork works, if the forked chain grows longer, the legacy chain gets reorged into the BIP148 chain. Think of the legacy chain like a bunch of orphaned blocks. 
There's a significant advantage to switching from the legacy to 148, or at least HF off the legacy chain. Staying on the legacy chain is just stupid.

Bitcoin is already in fractional reserve realm with futures and options. The difference between it and fiat is that it's impossible to bail people out. 
It's not impossible to pay interest on bitcoin, because if we were to use bitcoin as the base currency of the world, and all activities are priced in bitcoin, then any activity that you do will generate value, and because of the hard limit of bitcoin, the value of a bitcoin increases ever so slightly. That being said, investing is in fact a method of value creation. If you give a start up company money, you are effectively giving that startup the tools/capital required to do productive activities and generate more wealth. Assuming you get back a share of that wealth due to your investment, it is possible to pay back interest on that money that you borrowed to invest with. 
Long story short, there's not a fixed amount of value in the world, and value is created every day due to the collective efforts of various forms of intelligence. So you aren't necessarily stealing from anyone else to pay back interest.
The problem with this is the fact that it is substantially more risky than other financial instruments of the same type return.

And I don't disagree. But people seem to misunderstand that we simply don't have the room for anything drastically larger than a megabyte or two for base block size before nodes fall off rapidly, which is not an option. When you have the option for SegWit to be implemented immediately, it is irresponsible to delay that. Nothing is saying that we cannot increase base block size if Segwit isn't enough. But if it comes to centralizing the network or higher fees, you bet your ass I'll spend $10-20 fees all day. The draw to bitcoin is not its speed, ease of use, or anything of the like. It is the fact that it is capped supply and completely decentralized and no one can stop it. If it becomes a decentralized asset that takes a day or two to spend at a high cost, so be it. 


That's an outright lie that no one is against it being fixed. All EC is, is a fillabuster to the inevitable off chain scaling. Jihan has said it himself. No one seriously takes EC as a real threat. Malleability opens up off chain channels, and kills off the possibility of asicboost, why on earth would he want that over the status quo. Right now transaction fees keep rising and there's no alternative, so people keep paying them. Explain the incentive to *not* have it that way. 




So what's the difference between not capped and unlimited? You really think your little node is going to have a say once that arms race starts? Look at what happened to mining. Hope you have access to fiber, and better clear out space for a server rack, all for zero compensation back. Within a year, you fall within the demographic that wants to keep blocks at 8MB or whatever, but the hash power and majority of nodes now run by large interest groups disagree with you. Hope you can handle 250MB blocks. Likely 1GB blocks. 


Maybe you are just an incompetent person. Lightning network fills a void, even if 20%, that on chain scaling cannot feasibly do decentralized. Segwit also opens the door for many other technologies like side chains and other avenues to be explored which could quite easily fill that 80% in due time, much more effectively and decentralized than on chain. 


Ok, exactly my point. With 32 MB blocks we would have a sharp drop off in nodes (centralization) and a minimum return at best for scaling. 
Blocking Segwit in favor of larger blocks, especially when you leave the door open for even larger blocks, is downright irresponsible at this point.

Getting money into the ecosystem is often the hardest. ATMs and local bitcoins are fairly easy but tend to be pricey, especially if you aren't planning to hodl for long term. 
Your next best options are wiring money directly to an exchange like BTC-E. I've heard Gemini isn't bad, but I've never used them. You can try and see if you can eat paid in bitcoins, but if you work a traditional job, the only option I know of is Bitwage and they want to store a *lot* of ID data on you that I wasn't comfortable handing over to a bitcoin startup. 
Truth be told, I begrudgingly use coinbase from time to time. But their customer service sucks, it takes a long time, and it's usually pretty expensive from a fee/markup standpoint. For my next substantial purchase, I'm going to look into wiring money to an exchange. Think of coinbase as the Walmart of bitcoin retailers. They know they have a little mini monopoly, and they ride it out. 
It's funny that people call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme, because in a Ponzi scheme it's almost impossible to pull money out. Bitcoin on the other hand has hundreds of ways to easily cash out, but is pretty hard to get money in.

Are you seriously denying the existence of objective truths? There are objectively correct ways (right) and objectively incorrect ways (wrong) to scale bitcoin in a relative fashion to centralization. That's not debatable. What is subjectively debatable is how much centralization you deem to be ok. The general consensus is that maximum decentralization is better than lower fees considering we just hit another all time high in price today. 


You're damn right it isn't a religion. And we don't compromise, we work with objective truths, which are measurable by the market. And the market says there are no issues at the moment. Decentralization and fixed supply is a higher priority than transaction fees and speeds.

@_date: 2017-05-16 22:45:32
What are you talking about. You can't even see through your own bullshit. Miners get compensated primarily from transaction fees. And that trend will continue as block rewards decrease. Full blocks = higher transaction fees. Non full blocks = no transaction fees. There's literally direct correlation with that. Before full blocks and the drop in block reward, fees were optional. 
So tell me, when blocks aren't limited, how are you going to enforce a fee? What is your genius plan to compensate the miners as block reward drops. Please fucking god tell me you aren't in favor of increasing the block reward. 
Miners process on chain transactions. That doesn't chains. The only thing that changes is that scaling takes place off chain. You do realize that in order to even handle just MasterCard and visa volume alone, with 225 byte transactions (pretty much the most common simple transaction), blocks would be larger than 250MB. That doesn't include cash, ACH, or wire transactions, or the quadratically scaling multisig transactions that many side chains use. That's insane.
Meanwhile, off chain scaling can handle the majority of the transactions while onchain fees hover around $4/5. If I have an off chain service with $.01 cent transaction fees, or free depending on my profit model, I'd gladly pay $4/5, hell even 5-10 to sure up a couple hundred/thousand dollars worth of profit. Meanwhile, anyone can still afford an on chain transaction if needed. 
And what makes you think the miners would make fees cheap again anyways? They are *loving high fees*. It's a free pay raise. 
And before you come back with the bullshit "vision of the whitepaper" crap
1. A whitepaper is a logically convincing document, not a bible, not an infallible document that can't ever be revised, and certainly not a code roadmap. If we were still running Satoshi's original code, we wouldn't even have 1% of the volume we have now
2. It doesn't change the context of bitcoin. L2 scaling still is paying, peer to peer, with bitcoin. Nothing has changed with that. The only thing that changes is that we recognize that we can do better than 10-30 minute confirmations and entirely traceable coins, with transaction fees that would still be more than that of cash. It's starting to look like the blockchain really does look a hell of a lot more like a decentralized settlement network. Blows ACH out of the water, but can't compete at all with cash or visa/Venmo. But L2 can. And L2 can do it better faster, and cheaper than all of it, but *using* level 1. Do you really want to go back to 10 minute minimum wait times, where anyone can track your purchases, and now it is centralized because blocks are too big for you to run a node? Hell Ethereum is a lot faster than that right now. 
3. Who the fuck are you to extrapolate out the vision of bitcoin? And who the fuck is Satoshi to think he *owns* bitcoin and we should only do it the way he wants? Sorry, I'm an atheist, and while Satoshi is a smart guy, he's not immortal, not infallible, and can and was wrong on a lot of things. It's not his project anymore, it is the world project, and millions of people have wealth tied up that they don't want to be in the hands of hostile Asian peckerheads.

@_date: 2017-05-19 18:39:22


We don't need anyone to agree with us. That's the point of bitcoin. They can choose to go their way and we can choose to go ours.


[Sure thing]( And we can really show the general idea of an upper limit (albeit the estimates don't fair well to actually estimating what that size is) using some common sense and some basic math.
For credit card level transactions alone:
[1971 tx per second]( x [226 bytes per tx median]( x ~600s per block = **254** MB per block. This is the minimum as well, considering it is based off of the median transaction of a single input, 2 output (payee and change) transaction. With more inputs/outputs the size of the transaction rises substantially, and with multisig transactions, it rises quadratically as all the signatures which take up 60% of the transaction space, are required for each input. So this is the bare minimum.
The problem with a block size this big, beyond simply bandwidth and storage, is the capability to also *validate* and *forward* this block, which requires it to be loaded into RAM, and hashed, and then uploaded to other nodes to propagate across the network. This is hardware intensive as blocks get bigger and bigger. And it needs to happen every 10 minutes.
Raspberry Pi nodes, which many people run would most definitely not be able to handle this. As blocks get big enough, more and more people will not be able to run a node for their own purposes, which runs 100% contrary to the original purpose of bitcoin. If you are not using your own node, then you are not acting "peer to peer" and depending on the owner of the node that you are using to act in your best interest. While not every device needs to run a node, it should always be feasible for 95% (2 standard deviations) of the userbase to run a node. If not, you are not using bitcoin. Someone else is using bitcoin, and telling you the status, which is dangerous. And this is not speculation. Most proponents on the BU side are simply saying that not running a node is "fine", as most users won't and don't. Jihan said a few weeks back something along the lines of "it won't be that bad, just like a $10K node and an fiber optic internet connection". Now tell me how much of the population has that option available to them. That's not the point of bitcoin. The point is that you don't *have* to use a node unless you want to, and if you want to, that option is feasible. But by increasing block sizes, it directly affects the feasibility of that decision.


Ok, well if the goal is to remain a decentralized asset, which is what gives bitcoin it's value, not it's spendability, then yes, it is getting pushback A) because miners are using it to crack the door open to future "compromises" and B) arguably wouldn't even compromise. They are playing the [Nash equilibrium.]( They know that most people are not willing to compromise, and by maintaining that they are willing to, they keep the status quo. Right now, miners have a backlog of transactions, with the highest fees they have ever seen, and the price of bitcoin is going up. With SegWit, and off chain scaling, it opens the possibilities of ways that people can spend, which could drop those fees, and the transaction count, and there is no guarantee that it will result in a price increase, or how long lived that price increase will be. They are benefiting massively from the status quo. Most of them don't even really want EC, they just again, know that it would never pass, so it gives them a way to play the Nash Equilibrium.


I've conceded your point that you claim to be arguing. Now can we talk about 2mb+segwit hf?
Sure. Show me that Segwit and L2 scaling methods (LN and Atomic transactions) aren't capable of handling the current day volume because of the size of blocks, and then we can talk about increasing the block size (and thus risking at least *some* degree of centralization).

An unsubstantiated myth? Who the fuck are you kidding?
You do acknowledge that there is *some* upper limit of block sizes constrained by the laws of physics correct? Otherwise you're an uneducated fool. Why don't we just have 1GB blocks then? I'm sure your $500 desktop and residential internet connection could keep up with those every 10 minutes right? If your answer is no, you have no right spouting off that there is not a degree of centralization due to block size increases. 
To "substantiate" that, I think we would all be content with bitcoin at the very least competing with the credit card market, yes?
Let's "substantiate" it then:
[Theres approximately 1971 Visa and MasterCard transactions per second]( 
1971 transactions per second, 600 seconds in a block= 1,182,600 transactions per block. 
An average of 225 bytes per transaction, which is a very conservative estimate considering side chains usually result in quadratic hashing, but let's just focus on purely 1 input, 2 output (payee and change) transactions. By far the most common. 225x1182600/1024(b/kb)/1024(kb/mb)= ***253.75 MB per block. Just to keep up with only the volume of visa and MasterCard.*** That doesn't even begin replacing cash transactions, ACH, wire transfers, or the quadratically scaling multisig transactions. That's the most basic 1 in 2 out transactions.
You think a raspberry pi can keep up with that? CPU and Ram? Absolutely not. Well there goes a substantial amount of nodes. 
Most US data plans have a cap of data at 250GB, or at the very least start watching your traffic. Well, 253MB, with 6 blocks an hour, 24 hours a day, 30 days in a month, ***you are looking at 1070GB (1TB) of data a month.*** That's 4x the typical residential limit, and it's all dedicated to a background software. Let's forget the potential to use your internet for anything else. Well, there goes a substantial amount more nodes. 
So what are we left with. Those folks with fiber options available and hardware than can process 500MB blocks? How long will that last given that there's a group of miners that has demonstrated wanting to spend hundreds of millions to have control. 
***Get the fuck out of here with your "unsubstantiated" bullshit.***

As someone who within the past few years graduated from college, with student loans, and has since paid them off, I can't say I agree with covering student's bad decisions. This is objective reality, and there are consequences to pay. You cannot sign a loan to anyone under 18, and even at 18 no lender in their right mind signs to an 18 year old without a co-signer.
My experience in college was being surrounded by a lot of kids there, hardly paying attention, just going through the motions to get through "to just get the piece of paper" with an absurd amount of substance abuse, many people dropping classes or outright failing them for 100% their own fault, and just outright wasting time.
Attending college is by no means an automatic ticket to "becoming a productive member of society". In fact, I would argue that it kills that drive in many. I have seen some of my peers who showed extreme potential growing up, get caught up in the make believe wonderland that is college to result with nothing other than a piece of paper that says they wasted 4+ years of their life. Most likely more years, and more money considering a vast majority of students don't graduate on time anymore. They then get dumped out into the real world with a substance abuse problem, a degree that most likely fraudulently represents the ability to be proficient at something, and a longing to go back to the utopia safe space that is college (that also costs literally tens of thousands of dollars per year).
You are right that it is not a free market, but making college free (tax payer paid... nothing is free) would most definitely be the wrong solution. That only incentivizes these bad habits that are already going on in campuses. Tuition costs keep rising because people are willing to pay for it. Plain and simple. When the engineering labs are underfunded but the campus adds a $50M "student center" complete with 10 xbox's, you really need to take a step back and ask what the priorities of the school are.
And if 17/18 years old is not old enough to make a responsible decision, please do, let me know what is an appropriate age? What is really the case, is that people have coddled their children and at 18 years old they have the maturity of a 14 year old. Who's problem is that? I had no problem understanding the full contents of my loans at 18, because compounding interest really isn't that complicated of a subject to master.
I had $30k worth of student loans and now am debt free. It can be done if you aren't an idiot.

Woah woah woah woah now. You never said that at all. You said that it's an unsubstantiated myth that larger blocks leads to decentralization. It's in fact 100% substantiated that block size has a direct result to centralization. That's not the question, the question is how much. And what agreement? I don't recall ever signing anything? Whoever did can fuck off. They don't represent my interests. Bring your issue up with the signers of the agreement, not me. Until someone can show on a testnet that 2MB blocks are feasible without a drop off nodes within 2 standard deviations from what can be considered median hardware, I refuse to just accept your word for it. Right now the state of the argument, as I proved, is as block sizes grow, the network centralizes. It's up to you to prove that a raspberry pi can handle 2MB base blocks if you want to claim it. Centralization isn't an option. 


Yay, Segwit. I've been advocating for Segwit from the beginning. 


"So rather than do implement an actual scaling concept, we should do the exact opposite and exasperate the problem."


ZOMG!!! The sky is falling! Oh wait, I sent $6k the other day in less than an hour, to a completely secure account, from a completely secure account, without anyone asking who, what, or why, all for less than the cost of a wire. Nope, seems to be working just fine actually. 


"So we should abandon the malleability fix that enables many more scaling options than just LN. Because if we can't fix it all immediately, we just need to let the flood gates loose and admit defeat and allow it to centralize to 250MB blocks". 




Well we can mathematically *prove* that unlimited block sizes can't last. And how do you expect to compensate miners in the future if you aren't willing to pay a substantial fee?
Using the fastest, most secure blockchain on the planet has limitations. Sorry. That's objective reality. Right now it is completely decentralized, and working just fine albeit slightly expensive. I remember cell phones were expensive as shit too. I remember paying $2500 for an 8MB hard drive back in the day. New technology is expensive. Welcome to Earth!

You mean by blocking Segwit and making effective scaling exponentially harder by the nature of larger blocks?


So why ruin a good thing? To rush a shitty solution that literally *kills* bitcoins decentralization so that we can go back to 10 minute block pickup times? No thanks. 




Let's be real, the only reason miners are actually blocking Segwit is because it stops ASICBOOST and allows for effective off chain scaling, removing transactions from on chain. Very few of them actually want larger blocks. Namely a problem few that have demonstrated the outright willingness to take nefarious measures do. 


Like what? Alt coins? Those chains that have a quarter of the security? The ones that no one is even sure if they are bubbled not? You don't think they will hit a scaling limit at 6.9M transactions per hour (credit card levels)? And then when they hit those, they are even *harder to scale* in an effective manner. If all you want is a cheap, fast way to send money securely, go use ripple. If you want a decentralized way of storing/transferring decentralized money like there is currently nothing in the world that can compare, then you're a fool to give that up for a $2 fee to transfer money without permission. 


Miners work for us. They can fuck themselves as far as I'm concerned. They are a UASF and a POWC/A away from being replaced. And I'm not sure how 4 "core developers" represents the "community". Core can fuck itself too. Again, they work for us, the users. We show no allegiance to anyone.

There's certainly some anecdotes, but typically those anecdotes are strong proponents of formal education in addition to self education. Bill Gates didn't drop out because he was a genius and needed to smoke more weed in his dorm to come up with revolutionary Microsoft. Bill Gates dropped out because Microsoft was already taking off and it required his full, undivided attention to keep it alive. Propagating the idea that "dropping out" is a sign of genius is dangerous for society. In fact, objectively "most" people who are successful in the way we describe success in our society are in fact substantially educated. 
Now there's definitely a point where your education doesn't guarantee you being right, as proven here, but to just blow off people despite their formal education, or even worse *because* of their education is downright idiotic.

If you have a low fee, you are going to need to either wait it out, until it gets dropped from the mempool of unconfirmed transactions, or you will need to double spend it with a higher fee. 
If you have access to your private keys, you can technically make a new transaction with a higher fee, using the same inputs, and it will go through. The low fee one will get bounced because the coins will have been spent by the higher fee tx. This method isn't for the faint of heart. 
Your final option is to use a tx accelerator. ViaBTC has a free one, but everyone is using it. If you have a large amount stuck in limbo, it may be worth it to find a one that has a charge. I paid $2 to free up about $1000 and it was spent almost immediately after.

Gold would be useless in an apocalyptic scenario. I was in a disaster area after Harvey without power or water and within 24 hours there were lines outside of a grocery store with people looking for fresh water. If I was handing out water or gold, 100% of the people would have taken the water. 
Gold means nothing outside of its context as something of fixed supply. An absolute fixed supply of something means nothing outside of a normally functioning economy. With people looting and hoarding supplies, you’re gonna starve if you wasted your money on buying gold.

You very much do. If every transaction is being included in a block, tell me, how do you mandate people pay a fee. In fact, prior to these debates, fees were optional. They still are, but good luck getting included in a block. If block sizes increase, what is to stop the miners from simply imposing an arbitrary fee limit of their choosing? How is that different from a full block?


There's no evidence to show that the network can handle 2MB blocks without a substantial dropoff in nodes. Definitely not 10, and most certainly not 100. 


Again, what makes you think the miners want to lower your fees? They are 100% ok with the status quo. 


It definitely does if it comes without Segwit, which is what miners are protesting. And there are plenty of use cases for it. LN being one immediate one that could scale much faster and efficiently than any on chain scaling ever could. 


Well most people are hodling bitcoin anyways, so really he scaling debate is flawed. Hardly anyone is spending bitcoin. And the way LN would allow for spending bitcoin would be similar to using an internet browser. You chose which LN channels to open, and they act as central hubs. So you would open a channel with chrome, and it would then allow you to pay whoever else is connected to chrome, instantly, freely, and as many transactions as you want. Because it's a payment channel though, you are in control of your own keys at all time, so it is trustless. Well at least semitrustless that the channel you are using is actually going to pay the person you want to, which you can prove. There's an incentive to be honest to maintain the viability to be a hub. And again,  no one has access to your coins but you. So, yes, two on chain transactions for the potential to pay anyone instantly for unlimited transactions (or as long as you have the channel open). 


Probably because on chain bitcoin sucks compared to traditional payment channels. With visa, everyone takes it, I get cash back, it is instant, I have consumer protection, and only visa has my history. The government can get it with a subpoena. 
With bitcoin, it costs the consumer money, takes 10-30 minutes, has no consumer protection, and anyone at anytime can put the effort in to track all of your transactions.  No amount of blocksize increase can change any of that. That is bitcoin by nature. 
On chain bitcoin sucks as a payment platform, but is an excellent settlement network that services that *can* compete with traditional payment platforms. But those can't be developed without Segwit. 
Holding back Segwit is just holding back progress. On chain scaling does nothing.

BIP148 is happening on 8/1/17. A hard fork, especially one with a larger block size will be contentious and would take much, much longer than that to organize correctly.


Again, we have options, they don't. That's how game theory works. We exercise those options, knowing the risks. 


BIP148 is the fastest way forward short of the miners just having a change of heart.

It depends what you want to do. 
If you just want to hodl, then do nothing and watch the chaos ensue. You will have coins on both chains. 
Chances are that UASF will either be very successful, or fail miserably. In the case that it fails, or falls somewhere in the mediocre range, the miners on the legacy chain will hard fork off, to ensure that they don't lose everything from a reorg.
Eli5 of above: Bitcoin will be two different versions. Segwit version, and BU version. Again you will have coins on both chains. From that point forward, especially in the short run, you will need to be careful which coins you are spending. Again, if you are hodling, don't worry. In due time, either one will die, or both will mature in their own ways. **If you do nothing, you will have the exact same amount of coins that you have now on each chain.**

Segwit moves luggage from people's seat to the roof rack of the bus to make room for more passengers. 
"Emergent Consensus" is a hand wavy idea that we are going to just keep welding body sections onto the bus, with no regards to the structural integrity. The problem is, you have to have everyone to agree on how much body we should have every time, or have a "consensus emerge" when it is time to add it. Everyone who can service the bus (couldn't come up with a better analogy for nodes) can vote. Except the bigger the bus gets, the less amount of people are capable of servicing the bus so less amount of people get to vote. The guy with the most room in his garage has an incentive to keep making the bus bigger so that he's the only one to get the service contract. All this, so that people can keep their luggage on the seat next to them. 
Also, Segwit allows for cool technologies like being able to fit a bunch more people per seat (off chain transactions), and allows you to jump between other busses (atomic transactions) seamlessly. 
Unfortunately, some people don't care about the structural integrity of the bus and would rather just have cheap seats that they can keep their luggage in.

Please understand that bitcoin is not a stock. Imagine bitcoin to be like Gold. There is no CEO of Gold. 
Bitcoin exists in a purely free market. There are no market regulations. It is simple supply and demand. If more people are using/wanting bitcoin, with a fixed supply, price goes up. If more people want to sell bitcoin with a fixed demand, price goes down. All events can fit somewhere between these two cases.

lol here's the situation:
Miners know that people are willing to pay more if there is a large backlog. Therefore, they create a bunch of low fee/free transactions, that they know will never go through, and then artificially raise the cost to use bitcoin. If they process their own spam transactions they get their fees back.
Segwit would open up other avenues for people to make transactions, but why would they want that, when what they are doing works just fine. 
And nothing is broken. If you spend $1.50 on a transaction fee it will go through first block. Very few people are sending small amounts anyways, so it is still cheaper than sending that amount in USD ever would be. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:59:02
There is no peacefully going in their "own direction" Segwit is a soft fork and they have every right to run whatever code they want to on their node. That's part of the rules. If the participation is significant, than it is the Segwit blockers who aren't going in their own direction. If the participation is minuscule, then you really have nothing to worry about. 
But 8/1/17 there will be a good portion of economically active nodes enforcing the forward progress of bitcoin. If you oppose that, then you are more than welcome to hard fork off with whatever changes you want, or just not use the features Segwit has to offer.

Three things on chain transactions will always have no matter how big the block size is:
1. 10-30 minutes to confirm. This is on purpose. Litecoin has a higher orphaning risk, but they reap the benefit of faster confirmations. 
2. Fees. Miners are compensated using block reward and fees. Block reward is already low, especially for larger pools, and the miners already know people are willing to pay high fees. They control what transactions go in their blocks, and they can and will mine less than full blocks if it means setting a minimum for fees. 
3. 100% traceability. Knowing checkpoints along the way, there is software that can be used to track all of your transactions. There are currently people in jail right now for this exact reason. 
No matter how big blocks are, all of those things hold true. That is bitcoin. 
Off chain transactions are different. Off chain transactions use methodology to process transactions instantly, and cheaply/freely, while the off chain operator uses the bitcoin blockchain to sure up the amounts (much like banks use ACH to sure up their accounts). This is already happening. When you send money from a coinbase account, to a coinbase account, it is instant and free. When you send it out, you'll notice the input of the transaction leaving coinbase is more than you originally had. 
You account with coinbase is basically their internal database, and then they will make on chain transactions to input/output coins into their coin storage so that they supposedly have enough coins to cover all the accounts. You must trust them with this though. You are giving them 100% control of your coins, for this convenience of free/instant internal transactions. 
Segwit increases the block size, but more importantly, addresses "malleability" which is the idea that the transaction ID can be changed until it is included in a block. By fixing malleability, it makes something called LN possible, which basically allows you to open payment channels, and because of interconnectivity of people, and the use of common "hubs", the "hubs" act like coinbase would and keep everyone's accounts up to date, and use the blockchain to sure up the accounts. The difference between LN and coinbase is you are 100% in control of your coins. The private keys never leave your possession and no hack of the hub, or mistreatment of funds could ever make you spend your coins, because you always need to sign for your coins to be spent. 
So tl;dr, no, Segwit alone does not make on chain bitcoin transactions any faster/cheaper/more private. But it allows for transactions to be made off chain, which would most definitely fix all of that.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:27:01
The two prominent bitcoin scaling solutions are:
Segregated Witness (SegWit): SF solution that moves signatures into a merkle tree outside the block, allowing for approximately double the transactions for the same size block. Also fixes transactions malleability that would allow for many off chain scaling options to occur. Includes other cool features like enhanced upgrading features. 
Bitcoin Unlimited (BU/Emergent Consensus): I hesitate to even call this a solution because it still is little more than an idea. This is a hard fork upgrade that essentially removes the hard block limit entirely, and requires for the nodes to agree on a block size (emergent consensus) which they still have not explained how this would work. "Big blockers" believe that the true nature of bitcoin was entirely on chain bitcoin transactions, and are willing to risk the centralization of nodes to preserve that vision. This is a fact, because for credit card levels alone on chain, you would need a 250MB block size, which the average user would not be able to run a node that can download, process and store every ten minutes. Big blockers are admittedly ok with this fact, or don't understand the technicals. Many believe BU is being used as a fillabuster per se to keep all transactions on chain as long as possible and reap the benefits of high fees. 
UASF stands for User activated soft fork. Because the majority of active users support Segwit, there is an active effort to run BIP148 that will enforce that all blocks from 8/1/17 onward are Segwit blocks. The hope is that because what appears to be (at least the active) economic majority wants Segwit, miners won't risk mining on a chain that could reorg away, and will switch over to the chain that users seem to want. What will likely happen is that miners who don't want Segwit will HF off and there will be both a Segwit and a BU chain.

Thats the idea behind a UASF. 
The software Segwit doesn't activate until 95% threshold is met. 
Nodes are both users and miners. Nodes just check the blocks and tell your wallet what the current balance of all wallets are, and then pass on that block to other nodes. 
With a UASF, the users who are running nodes are saying "on 8/1/17 we will only accept blocks that signal for Segwit as valid blocks". This means that any miner who makes a block that isn't Segwit enabled, when it hits those nodes, they will say no, and wait for a new block that does signal Segwit. So you'll have a portion of the network saying that the current account status is x and another saying the current account status is y. If there's enough mining support to keep working on the Segwit chain, then the chain splits. In that case, with  only 40% hash power, the non Segwit blockchain would grow slowly, and if enough of the economic majority gives the Segwit chain value, then the miners on the 40% either keep wasting electricity making useless blocks, or they jump on board with the Segwit blocks if they want to keep making money. It basically forces the miners to make a decision. 
Some people have run simulations that show in the case of a closely contested UASF, almost all miners abandon the old chain and go with the Segwit chain.

That resets every 2 weeks or so, but the BIP148 chain never expires. So even if it takes 6 months to get to that reset of difficulty, it will drop substantially, and then again the legacy chain is at risk of being reorged. Plus, any miner who realizes Segwit is inevitable is going to be mining on the 148 chain. Really the only way for miners to fight it is to HF off. But then they have to expect for people to follow them. 
It's really a losing situation for the miners.

Do not leave it with Coinbase or any other service company. 
Use an actual wallet software, hosted on your computer. 
Your coins are always "in the cloud" per se,
But the private keys to sign those coins are what a wallet stores. With something like coinbase, you don't have the private keys. They are just like a bank, where they credit your account, and you can spend as much as you put in, but it comes from their own wallet.
If you don't have the keys, they are not your coins.

BitFury has since changed positions. The research that there are technical limitations to the block size still remains though, which is what you asked for.


Because block sizes are small. If EC becomes a reality, that would be changed very, very quickly. Most people don't have the infrastructure or financial standing to run a massive block node. And if the costs got high enough, we would likely be seeing profit models set up where you would need to pay to even have access to a node.... Starting to sound similar to the system we already have. My "node" is named "Wells Fargo" and the operators are assholes.


So they only include enough transactions in the block that include a high enough fee to fund their operations. They can already mine empty blocks if they choose too, and most already do have minimum fee limits so that they aren't doing charity work. Miners end up compensated, there are no shortages of space in the block size if you are willing to pay the market rate for it, and we don't risk centralization.


They aren't competing with Segwit. They are competing with off chain transactions, which are already happening. Whether with alt coins, or centralized services like Coinbase's eco system where transactions are free and instant. At least with Segwit they are getting a piece of the pie as they process the on chain transactions. They mine on chain transactions, that's what they signed up for, and that's all they will ever do. Nothing changes with that. Off chain transactions for L2 depend on on-chain transactions.


So then we hard for Segwit, with no block increase. And if we need a block increase, we then just hard fork again. But we aren't going to "compromise" for Segwit to get through. It is happening with or without the opposing miners, through a UASF or a MASF at some point in the future. Like I said, the opposing side knows they aren't  on the winning side of the battle. They are just holding ground and making profits that are immediately available in the form of a high backlog of high fees.

No you are insane for proposing that we open up the possibility for 250MB+ blocks by scaling on chain.

So to make any protocol change, all they have to do is call a backdoor meeting like they just did. If you don't like the change... tough. And the guy running the node you access through doesn't care about your decision, just his wallet. Let's call him "Fargo". Fargo and Chase don't really care what you want. 
Now if blocks are small, you can run a node and decide what protocol you run. IE UASF. Without the users running nodes, there are no UASFs.

Changing the blocksize and blocktime isn't without tradeoffs. 
You can't have the security or decentralization of bitcoin without a low block size and a long block time. Raising blocksize/increasing speeds just results in more orphaned blocks.
This is a fundamental aspect of distributed ledger systems and was in fact the first comment made to Satoshi after reading the white paper. 
On chain scaling is not an option. Off chain scaling is the only true way forward to retain the features people own bitcoin for anyways. People don't own bitcoin for speed or ease of use. Visa is much faster and easier.

The more support this garners, the more legitimate it becomes to user services. Users have much more power than they realize. Miners, Devs, and services are all here to make money, and the Users provide the money/value to the chain.
If users can rally support, services will publicly support it, and we can pressure the miners to make a move. About 30% of miners are not even voting for a scaling solution. They are a-okay with the current situation (lots of waiting transactions with record high fees). Why change without a push?

I think the 2014 crash came from a lot of people holding large volumes with the price on the way up, in a very crazy experiment, with every "financial expert" in the world talking about how it would fail. No matter how much we all believed, no one who was holding to a substantial amount in 2014 held onto most of it unless they were stuck holding the bag because no one knew if it would ever be that high again.
Now, 3-4 years later, it's not only alive, but thriving. People trust it won't go to zero. There's infrastructure. There's need. The most positive sign I saw for bitcoin was after the ETF failure. 15 seconds after it was announced, it tanked to $1000 from $1300, but was quickly bought back up to $1100. Since then we've had a strong bull market. People didn't spook and sell off like 2014, they bought up all the "cheap bitcoin" that they could. That's huge in terms of bull market health. $1200 is the absolute floor now. I honestly think there's not another massive crash before the mass adoption balloon to $100k. Anyone who was in it the past 2 years knows it's a long game, knows it won't go to zero, and will buy up on the "cheap" busts.

Emergent Concensus *is* unlimited block size. What do you think the "Unlimited" comes from?
Lightning network alone can't but there are many other solutions that are available as well that *all* depend on malleability to be fixed before they can be implemented. ALL off chain scaling options are better than on chain scaling options, because its not clear that we can even grow 200% volume on chain without massively centralizing.


Fuck you too. At least I deal with the facts at hand.


Really? Because Segwit seems like it is increasing the block limit without one. And then we have off chain scaling efforts. Do you have evidence to support that with all the doors that opens up we can't effectively scale off chain? Because I'm pretty sure I substantially showed that we can't do it on chain.

I think when we think in terms of volatility, it's because we are comparing it to some other medium of exchange. If bitcoin was to become mainstream and looked at as a standard of value of some sort, it would force other currencies to compete. If we have some method of instant payments in the future, I don't see how fiat could compete at all, in which everything would be valued in bitcoin, and bitcoin would become a "fixed value" in people's head. Just like when you go to subway and get a $5 sub, you, nor the shop owner cares about the current exchange rate, until inflation forces prices to be raised over time. But I don't see a problem with things eventually being priced in bitcoin, and it would seriously curb the volatility.

Without instant transactions being available, which only level 2 can bring, by the nature of 10 minute blocks, I think bitcoin will always be seen as a value storing asset more than it is a "digital cash".

The "space" is unlimited in terms of the future. They can very certainly place an artificial block limit deciding their price. Just like how in countries without minimum wage, wages are typically higher. You wouldn't work for free. If you send a tx with a fee that isn't attractive to the miners, they just don't process your block. If someone else wants to waste the hash power including them, than that's their issue. The user who puts a lower tx fee increases his time in the mempool from lack of miners trying to include his tx. Literally the exact same situation that is occuring now would occur then.


You are underestimating the support severely.


Because plenty of people are against a block size increase at all. There *will* be a chain split on a block size increase. Guaranteed.


UASF is an option. HF is an option. POWC/A is an option. Dumping bitcoin all together for Litecoin is an option. Miners only have the option of blocking Segwit as long as possible.


They have the option of choosing to signal Segwit, or blocking it. Blocking it leads us to their better Nash Equilibrium. It makes perfect sense that we are here right now if the users are unwilling to do anything about it. Most will freak with a UASF though. The economic benefits of higher fees temporarily, are severely outweighed by the possibily of mining on a chain that could be reorged if enough other miners beat you to it. Segwit is the best solution long term and they all know that. It's a dangerous game of chicken for them to mine on the legacy chain.

And it's still purely unfounded conjecture that the price of a transaction would go out of the reach of a normal user. Hell, people pay $30+ for an overdraft fee. Sending money on the most secure platform on the planet doesn't need to be held artificially low in price if it means giving up provable centralization. Bitcoin is not a charity. 
Maybe bitcoin isn't capable to handle the worlds transactions on a daily level. The purpose of bitcoin was a decentralized peer to peer transaction system. It does that just fine right now and even better with LN. Bitcoin never once promised to become the next PayPal or Visa. And even if it did, technical realities need to be faced.

Yes and no. Its not an apples to apples comparison, but some of them aren't very far off either. For example the gold one can start with the entire market cap of gold, applied to bitcoin. Which isn't too far of a stretch considering bitcoin retains most of the advantages of how people traditionally invest in gold (the vast majority of gold is owned through ETFs), yet it includes many more advantages. So by applying the market cap of gold, you are essentially comparing the market cap of a similar and arguably inferior asset.
By adding an arbitrary percentage in front of such a price estimation, it offers further validity in that it neglects the argument that all of that market needs to transfer over. In fact, if 1/20 people sees bitcoin as the same/better than gold, then this valuation is completely reasonable.
While all the examples you listed are completely pointless, I agree, a lot of comparisons of market cap are useful to demonstrate just how minuscule bitcoin is in comparison to some of the overall financial instruments around today. To the average person, a 4 figure valuation for a bitcoin is absurd because it cuts into a significant portion of the world's net worth. But when you look at the number $30B in comparison to other things that are substantially larger than that $30B, it helps to show that in the grand scheme of things, bitcoin really isn't even that expensive for what legitimately contains the potential for. In terms of being on the financial spectrum, it's barely a blip on the radar right now. Comparing it to household names puts it into more perspective on the vast amount of value that is out there.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:56:09
Andreas Antonopoulos' book Mastering bitcoin includes a chapter about nodes where he creates a transaction from scratch step by step. You could do the same with basic Core node software. 
Basically, you choose the inputs that you want, and the outputs where you want them to go, and it will give you a hex string as a transaction. You can then sign that transaction, and it gives you a new hex string. You then just use that hex string to broadcast that transaction. 
There may be applications online that will create unsigned transaction hex strings, that can then be copied/pasted into core and signed offline.

Let the market do its thing. Use the coin that you get the most benefit from. The reason bitcoin is still dominant is because it is unmatched in decentralization, security, development, and brand recognition. If that changes, the market will force bitcoin to change. People literally have their careers based on this platform, and hundreds of millions if not billions invested in it. It is beyond "experiment" phase, and it is not going to die. 
If LN is developed on Litecoin, then perfect, we knock out all the kinks on a smaller chain, and then use that code into bitcoin. 
Segwit will pass in due time. Maybe that's a year or two from now, but no one takes BU seriously beyond a noobs who don't understand the scaling technicals and fell for propaganda. Even miners recognize it as just a fillabustering move to prevent off chain scaling for as long as possible. But alt coin growing is "off chain scaling" too, so if that market takes enough profits from them, they will be forced to change their position. 
Don't worry. The sky is not falling. Bitcoin is doing exactly what it was designed to do: resist change and facilitate innovation, and let market forces guide the way.

Well, they do "create" bitcoin, but it's really not the meat of mining. Think of bitcoin like a global scoreboard. There really aren't any "coins", just decimal amounts assigned to public hash addresses. Those hash addresses have private keys that allow you to prove you own them. When you have a wallet, really, you just have a database of public/private key pairs, and the spends that are locked to those keys (the "documents").  Miners simply add a transaction to themselves for whatever amount is globally accepted as the block reward, and because they didn't reference a previous spend, they are *new*. So if I was to find a block that works, but I made that block with a 20BTC reward rather than just a 12.5BTC reward, the nodes would check it, and would reject it because it doesn't play by the rules. Now I just spent money on a block that will get rejected. So even though I *want* to cheat, it's in my best interest not to cheat. Similarly, if someone else is cheating, it's in my best interest to call them out on cheating and reject that block. As long as everyone is working to their own best interest (what we call rationality in economics), the system works. 


So every transaction references enough previous outputs (as inputs this time) to create the balance of the output you want. You then create however many "spends" you want from that. So I may have been paid $30 in $1s, but I can just reference those 30 documents referencing those ) 1s to a single output of $30 (less my fee). Now, because I have assigned the value of $30 to public key x, only the person with the private key corresponding to x can use that $30 as an input. So that person would only have a single input of $30 in whatever transaction that they chose (assuming it is &amp;lt;= $30). By referencing the transaction to them for $30, they are referencing the block it was included in, which is mathematically provable to be valid all of the way from the genesis block. And yes, because the block includes the spend from your account, you balance would decrease. Really, your wallet is just scanning the blockchain for all spends that are locked to your public key, and then adds up that amount to make your balance. So because you have now reassigned those $30 in ones to someone else, they no longer reference your account. So when your wallet refreshes its balance, it would see $30 less in transactions locked to you. 


Yes and no. There's obviously renewed interest in alt coins when bitcoin progress has stalled. Ethereum picks up the slack of programmable smart contracts, which is something bitcoin can't currently do. I happen to believe that whenever you have smart people concentrating their efforts, value is created. So some of the growth is probably organic, but yes, at least a portion of it can be attributed to the uncertainty surrounding bitcoin, and the prospect of quick profits elsewhere. It does foster some innovation on other projects, but you should be mindful that once scaling is "solved", money will probably rush back into bitcoin from the alts. Ver has admitted to spending over $500k per month to pay shills to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) about bitcoin which can only help alt coins. 


No problem. Glad I can help. The more people that understand bitcoin below the surface, the more we can help bitcoin in the correct direction. 
Btw, I have learned just about everything I know from a guy named Andreas Antonopoulos. You can find him on YouTube under the username of aantonop, and he does a weekly podcast called "let's talk bitcoin". He does a very good job of connecting the gap between developer level understanding, and end user understanding, and gives what seem like weekly talks at various conferences, teaching people about bitcoin. Definitely check him out, because compared to him, I do bitcoin a disservice.

Why would 0 miners move over?
Mining pools are made of many individual miners who can point their mining power wherever. 
Why would any miner that wants Segwit, not mine on a Segwit activated chain, when there is little to no competition? Especially when that chain has the potential to reorganize the legacy chain, but the legacy chain can't ever reorg the Segwit chain? In fact, it is suicide to continue mining on the legacy chain, because after enough time the difficulty on the Segwit chain will get so low that anyone can then mine. 
One of two things will happen 8/1/17:
1) Miners know they lose and are forced to end their charade and majority of hashing power jumps ship
2) Mining power is split, so the legacy miners hard fork off to ensure that they don't get reorged (they would be stupid to even risk it). At that point, it's no different from BU forking off right now. Go ahead. Fork off. We dare you. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:09:31
No. It's is provable that we cannot scale on chain alone. 
Visa level credit card transactions alone would require 250MB blocks at the minimum:
1971 tx/s X 600 s per block X 225 bytes (minimum) per transaction = 250MB. 
And that's for a basic single in, two out transactions. It scales quadratically with many inputs requiring many signatures. Realistically that level of transaction would require 1GB blocks. That you not only need to download every 10 minutes, but you need to store it in RAM and validate it, fast enough to upload to another node so that we don't orphan blocks. That is only Visa levels alone. No cash or wire/ACH transfers. 
It's not feasible to scale on chain. We already know that (see above). We need to begin to scale of chain and scale on chain only to accommodate off chain scaling.

I don't think you understand how LN works. Both parties lock funds into a multisig address. Then they can play around with net numbers all day long, however they want to play around with them, but then they publish a full, normal bitcoin transaction, for the net amount of the transaction at the state. On the local level, they both recreate local versions of that transaction at the time of that transaction. So transactions can only happen with both parties. Lets say I send you $5, and then you send me $3. You can submit the older transaction for $5 to the chain all you want, but I have a transaction, signed by you, at a later date that says you sent me $3, and it is valid. The off chain transactions don't need to be confirmed. Because the amounts can never exceed the amount of the overall payment channel. They are "confirmed" as valid at the time of the channel by signing them, and the transaction is constructed at the end, buy sending them from a multisig address. That's all. It is all done with bitcoin transactions.


No your example included someone stealing the funds with a QR code. That's completely impossible if the funds are locked into a multisig account with your bitcoin keys. If they have your keys, then they have your coins anyways. If they don't, then there is literally, absolutely 0 risk. Because they are locked into a multisig account, that you have the most recent signature to be able to get that money back. Until you make a transaction off chain, and both decide to sign a brand new closing transaction. LN are truly just 2 transactions, you are just waiting to figure out net amounts before you settle. That's all.


Well then you sir are a fucking idiot. LN *is* bitcoin.


Bitcoin is onchain p2p bitcoin transactions. LN doesn't change that. It just uses the nature of most people's transactions to offer a faster, cheaper alternative than on chain transactions if you chose to do so. If you increase block sizes, you increase centralization. That's a verifiable fact. So given that we can't scale on chain with centralization, either we sit at the status quo (which I'm fine with), or we move forward with lightning (which I'd love). But if you think that we are going to increase centralization, and that I and many other's will keep our value on that chain, you are high. If bitcoin increases blocks to the point of centralization, I along with many others who believe in decentralization will be moving to the forked, decentralized chain. Even if it isn't the highest priced coin. 












LN *has all of those properties at your closing transaction with the person that you opened it with*. It is literally not different at all from deciding to send them money from the beginning, but instead you decided to wait to make a net amount.
Who says you have to use LN. You *choose* to use LN if you would like to. Most users want decentralized, instant, and cheap transactions, blocked by bitcoin security (because a LN transaction *is a fucking onchain bitcoin transaction at some point*), so it will open up the lane for you to work on chain. And if not, well using the most decentralized blockchain on the planet has a pretty price to pay. That's life.
Bitcoin has value because it is decentralized. Increasing block sizes does exactly the opposite. So you won't ever get the economic majority on your side. If you want a large block bitcoin, you are *going to have to fork whether you want to or not.* There's nothing wrong with that. Just don't expect my money to follow.

You are still depending on the connection to a node for that Trezor to make any transactions, so, yes. The only way to use bitcoin 100% trustlessly is to run the bitcoin protocol and validate the blocks as they come in. Otherwise you are depending on someone else to tell you the truth.

It's not backwards, but there's some key words that shouldn't be neglected:


Which ***should*** be followed with the also true and relevant statement:
"if the miners would like to reap the rewards of blocks that the full Bitcoin network nodes will validate (and thus be seen as economically valuable), then the miners must produce blocks that conform to the network node's consensus rules."
tl;dr- Everyone chooses their own validation rules. If your rules are in alignment with the rest of the network, your rules are the consensus rules.

Because of technical limitations, only a certain number of transactions can fit in a block. And certain mining pools are mining empty blocks. 
Space in a block on the most secure, decentralized blockchain in the world is scarce just like bitcoin. So you pay a market price for it. Same reason you can't just go up to NASA and expect for them to put you on the next rocket to the ISS. It's expensive to send people into space. 
There's fixes to this problem to allow for transactions to take place off chain, and be shored up at a later date, but unfortunately a few miners are worried about their lost profits from not being able to charge large amounts of money for all transactions. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:22:14
I think you are confused. The economic majority most definitely wants Segwit. A few miners are fillabustering it in order to pad their bottom line with high fees. They work for us, not the other way around. August 1st, the rest of the bitcoin community will be moving forward with SegWit, and the miners who oppose can feel free to go separate ways. But this has gone on long enough to continue waiting on a few bad actors.

Imagine a very long two column spreadsheet (ledger). The first column has your public address. The second has the amount of bitcoin you own, just like a scoreboard. 
You wouldn't ask where "the points" are at an NBA game because they represent something. Similarly bitcoin represents you doing something that someone decided to give you bitcoin for. A total of slightly less than 21M will ever be created and every ten minutes the miner who makes the most up to date version of this ledger ads 12.5 coins to his account. After 4 years this decreases to 6.25, then 3.125 etc until 0. If the miner tries to cheat, it's like the bulls putting 6 players on the court. Everyone knows, and no one is cool with it, and the miner loses money for spending time/electricity trying to cheat. 
To spend your points (coins) you have to have your private keys, which are mathematically provable to belong to any public address. When you spend your coins, you "point" at the transaction to you, and "write a check" assigning a portion of that transaction to another person, and say that it can only be spent with their private address. Anyone with your private key can spend the points (coins) attached to it. 
The hardware wallet holds your private keys.

You severely misunderstand EC. By running BU, nodes agree to do away with a block size limit. 
You are correct that nodes are the only thing that stop the miners from mining larger blocks. But by running BU, you are permissing the miners to pick any size from 0 to "unlimited". How do you expect for this block size to be reigned in at that point? All the nodes then agree to keep the blocks "small enough to handle"? No one can agree on a size now, that would just end with endless forks. Nevermind the fact, that miners can simply ramp up the size further and further, and then they are the only ones running nodes. So even if your plan *could* work, it wouldn't work for long, as miners slowly but surely kill off node feasibility, you will be on the chopping block too at some point. Do you really want to start an arms race with a group of people who had demonstrated the ability and willingness to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on hardware, and have millions of dollars worth of cash flow each month?
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:00:05
Not the case. The hash of a block changes if anything in it changes, so all the tested nonces could theoretically be the solution. You only start testing when you have a block built.
The reason empty block are mined is because validating a block takes time. As does building a block, that includes the previous block. While that is happening, I may as well try my luck building an empty block. Best case scenario I win the reward, worst case scenario I neglect it and move on with the real block when it is ready to go. Mining is a game of nanoseconds.
By mining empty blocks, they are following the rules, which is just to make a block with a certain number of zeros on the left. Thus they get the reward. But if you are spouting off about how mad you are that the mempool is full, yet you are mining empty blocks, clearly your concerns are more focused on your own wallet than the mempool. In fact, many pools don't mine empty blocks for the premise. They are taking a loss in the time to build a block, so that they don't screw the network.
There's ways to fix this issue, but *certain mining pools* aren't interested. Interestingly enough its the same pools who fight Segwit, had a killswitch on miners, use a proprietary algorithm, and have a monopoly on ASIC manufacturing/sale, and *mine more empty blocks than any other pool combined*.

Ok, well I agree with you that objectively true paths forward depend entirely on stated objectives. And that if we don't have agreement on those, then we are going to be in disagreement on what is objectively true. So here are my axioms for bitcoin:
1) 21 million total units. A capped supply (I know it's slightly less)
2) Decentralized. This is the main sticking point in discussion, as to what that actually means, so I will lay out my definition; the ability for any user to run a node with computer hardware that is within two standard deviations from the median level of consumer hardware at the time. The objective is to ensure that 95% of all computers on the network are capable of running bitcoin, and it should never be severely economically infeasible to run a node. If nodes turn out like mining pools, we can assume we have failed. From an objective measuring point, a drop off of more than 2.5% (bottom deviation) in nodes is not acceptable. 
I am staying that there are objectively right and wrong ways of progressing scaling in regards to these two stated goals. "Compromise" isn't an option if we alienate further from these to scale. Because proposed "compromises" don't get us any closer to these, and actually move us further away than the current status quo. 
By increasing block size you decrease the transaction fee. You increase number of transactions, which may or may not result the same compensation. The miners are aware that consumers are willing to spend high levels of transaction fees as they are right now. Why would miners be incentivized to mine blocks with minimal fees? Especially as the block size decreases. In order to have low fee transactions, we either scale off chain, or we increase block reward. The latter breaks axiom number 1. The former (Segwit) doesn't. 
Increasing block sizes also has a demonstrable affect on the feasibility to run a node. I agree that there's probably *some* wiggle room on chain without affecting axiom number 2, but it's far less than people are expecting. Maybe another megabyte at most. I'd need to be shown actual test results to be convinced it is any higher. Pulling out random guesses is not sufficient imo. 


True, but we have grown to $30B under the guise of a "decentralized payment network". Much of the growth comes from safe haven money, avoiding the traditional system, not from people looking to make lots of transactions. Let's be real, the current on chain transaction experience, full blocks or not, is abysmal. 10 minute minimum, 20-30 for a confirmed, transaction fees, and anyone can track your money 100%. That is awful compared to cash. The only thing bitcoin offers over cash at the moment, is a safe haven from centralized control. And as you can tell from its value, that has huge upside potential. 
To sacrifice that just so we can go back to lower fee (still more than cash/visa), slow transactions is just pathetic in my opinion. Even best case scenario for on chain, Ethereum and even litecoin are faster and cheaper to spend on. 
Off chain scaling is the only logical path forward. "Compromise" doesn't do anything but move away from those goals. 
If you are walking down the road and your friend tells you that you guys should jump into traffic, you don't "compromise" by telling him that you'll only consider putting a leg in the way. Some ideas are just don't deserve to even be entertained. EC is one of those ideas.

If that means that people who are willing to sacrifice the feasibility of running a node with hardware within two standard deviations from normal, consumer grade hardware (i.e. Middle 95%), then sure they can leave. 
Because the bitcoin blockchain isn't about fast or cheap payments. It takes 10-30 minutes, and won't ever be free considering block size keeps reducing more and more and miners already know that people are willing to pay more. A centralized bitcoin blockchain pales in comparison to other centralized payment methods. It blows all other settlement networks out of the water though and can be used as the basis for making payment methods that *are* faster and cheaper, and easier than other methods. 
Bitcoin gets its value from decentralization and fixed supply. End of story. If you give that up for on chain scaling, you are a fool. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:50:38
The way bitcoin works, there's "inputs" and "outputs", and all your inputs have to add up to the amount that you want to output. The output is then used as an input in a future transaction. So likely, what happened, is you don't have a set of inputs that will add up to .16BTC alone, so your transaction is using an input of .37 BTC, and sending 2 outputs. One for .16 BTC to wherever you are sending it, and one of .21 BTC (minus your fee amount), back to yourself (probably a different address but your wallet will know what to do.
You then can use that .21 BTC as in input for any other transaction. If you wanted to spend .25 BTC, you could reference that .21 BTC as an input, and a .04 BTC as an input.
Basically, think of it as making your own change and sending it back to yourself.

I think it's a lot closer than what you think. People typically flock to gold in uncertain scenarios, but since bitcoin's inception, every time a country collapses, bitcoin rises. With a 0.7% first quarter GDP, after 8 years of a bull market, the US economy is slowing down. We have over 700 atms, coinbase, localbitcoins, etc etc, and buying bitcoin is safer than a gold etf considering only I control my bitcoin. 
I think with the coming bear market for the US, many people are going to be looking at bitcoin to hedge their savings with. If 1/20 of those people who normally turns to gold turns to bitcoin, we would see this value, and probably more because people would look at the return vs gold and put more in (momentum effect).

Using historical analysis and a line of best fit to chart volatility, and using that same trend going forward, we can estimate that around the 2020 time frame volatility will slow to the same percentage of fiat levels (1% per day). 
Just because the price of a bitcoin is jumping massively up and down, percentage wise, it's really not bad at all. You will likely never buy anything other than a house with a full bitcoin in the not so distant future, so worrying that the cost of a bitcoin swings up by a couple hundred or down by a couple hundred only affects pennies on the microeconomic level.
For example, 5% on $20 is $1, so you can reasonably expect for anything in the $20 range to stay more or less fixed in price. As the price of a full bitcoin rises, the amount of change on that transaction is even harder to change significantly. Think of it like penny stocks. It's entirely easy to get 10x your money or lose 10x your money if the stock is worth $.05. But if the stock is worth $500, even doubling or halving your money would be quite hard.

It needs to hit full on asset level first, which for its market cap is minuscule. The dollar is able to be backed by nothing because it was originally backed by gold, and people never noticed when that went away. But if you look at the potential of bitcoin, if it were to be digital cash, its value would be astronomically more simply by market cap. It much more closely mimics a gold etf and will need to reach that level of market cap before people see it as something like cash.

How else do you propose? A marginal increase in block capacity that still doesn't even touch the scaling problem? Or a massive increase in block capacity that induces orphaning and centralization.

So we can deal with blocks like that in 50 years. Early computers and cell phones were very expensive at first too.
If we centralize just to get marginally better transaction fees, and still have 10-30 minute transactions, that is stupid. I'd rather have bitcoin be a reserve asset that cost $20 to transfer that centralize and be an option worse than all the current options. 
Saying L2 can't scale bitcoin alone is pure conjecture. There's absolutely no empirical evidence that it can't. We can quite easily prove that we can't scale on chain indefinitely though.

Average of 225 bytes per transaction (which is small, considering many side chains use signature hashing that actually scales quadratically) at 1000000 transactions:
225bytesx1000000 transactions=225000000 bytes. 
225000000 bytes / 1024 bytes/kb = 219726 kb
219726 kb/1024 kb/mb = 214.6 MB
You just proposed 214.6 mb blocks. You think your shitty internet connection and consumer grade hardware can handle that block every 10 minutes? You're a fucking joke. 
But hey, you have the *right* to run a node... /s
Fuck, I live in capitalist America. I have the *right* to start a bank. Are you proposing our banking system is decentralized?
And I would easily run pay an $18 fee if I was collecting $1500 in off chain transactions through a lightning network hub. $1482 pure profit? Sign me up. 
Plus, current block sizes can handle 3000-4000, so even your argument is flawed. You are looking at $4.5-6 per transaction. Cheaper, faster and more secure than ACH, a wire, a cashiers check, whatever. And really not that unaffordable for the general public.

Its going to cost you much *much* more than $15 a month to run a node if blocks are unlimited size....
Let's do a little objective math with *bitcoin* shall we?
[Visa and mastercard alone process 1971 transactions per second]( I think we can all agree this is an acceptable scaling goal yes?
So 1971 transactions per second x ~600 seconds per block = 1,182,600 transactions per block.
Now lets use the most common, but also most simple and smallest type transaction, the one input, two output, payee and change transaction, that is almost always 225 bytes. This is about as small as they practically get unless you are sending all the money to a new address. They only get larger from here. In fact, multisig transactions scale quadratically...
225 bytes x 1,182,600 transactions /1024 (bytes/kb) / 1024 (kb/mb) = 253 MB per block. Every ten minutes. You not only need to download that, you need to store that, and you need to load it into RAM, and have your computer hash it in SHA256 and then forward it if it is valid, all within 10 minutes. Think you can handle that? By the way, thats about 1TB of data a month through your residential plan. And that's just MasterCard and Visa. Wait till we throw in cash, ACH, and wire transfers for the existing population, and the 2B unbanked people out there.
Scaling will need to happen off chain. Now is that time. A solution is ready to go that would enable all that innovation to happen. With off chain scaling, $30 transaction fees would be nothing compared to the money lighting node runners would get in microtranaction fees ($.005/transactions for instant transactions, completely trustless).
What do you want to go back to? 10 minutes to get picked up in a block? with 250MB blocks, you can bet there's going to be more orphaned blocks, so waiting at *least* 30 minutes to ensure you are confirmed? That coffee is cold by then buddy. By the way, you think miners are just going to roll over and let you get away with a low fee? Please, what makes you think the miners are on your side buddy?

Ok, well if all you want are low fees, and an electronic way to pay for things, then why not use something like Apple Pay, Venmo, or Paypal? They are all instant, much more accepted, faster, and free. Hell, with rewards cards, you even get money back.
What is it that you think gives bitcoin it's value? It is *not* its ease of use, its spendability, its fees, or its transaction times/volumes. It is the fact that it is a decentralized currency, that you alone can control. If you give that up for low fees, you are a fool, because there's already better options that bitcoin in those arenas.
Instant and cheap transactions will come in time, just like modern day smartphones came in time. But just like all other things technical, bitcoin has trade-offs, and the speed and cost of transaction is one that we are going to need to deal with if we want for bitcoin to remain decentralized. If you don't care about that, trust me, the current banking system that we have will fill all of your needs. The reason bitcoin is taking off is because people see the current system failing. So the price you pay to get away from the new system is going to be high fees and slow transactions, at least until technology can catch up. It is 100% provable that we cannot scale on chain and remain decentralized to the point where anyone is able to run a node if they chose to do so.

No. There may be an industry *around* those commodities, but it's just silly to call bitcoin a "business". It doesn't even have a logical backing. 


No, we aren't providing anything. You maybe providing a service that services those wishing to use bitcoin, but bitcoin itself isn't "providing" anything. If bitcoin doesn't fit their cup of tea, well that's their own problem. Bitcoin is a capped supply, and is decentralized. That's it. If you alter either of those properties for usability in the short run, you are on an alt coin. 


No, the restaurant franchise is a *terrible* analogy. I do not understand how you can't comprehend that. How can you compare scaling the productive actions of people and equipment, to scaling something for which there are literally physical limits. The only way your analogy works, is if you are literally running out of cows to make burgers with. It is impossible to scale on chain and remain centralized. You already admitted it. A "12tb laptop and a 1gbps" connection are not decentralized in the least. 


No, you don't. Unless you come up with some technical advancements to literally manufacture cows, you can't scale. You are out of cows. 


Edgy bro. 
*The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.*
*If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.*
There is much, much more to validating blocks than just bandwidth and disk space. Come on, if you really have the credentials to run an exchange (doubting it at this point) that should be obvious to you. 


Not on a decentralized scale. If it's larger than what can be run with a raspberry pi, then enjoy your forked alt, I'll stick with the decentralized bitcoin. 


In 10 minutes? And processing those blocks? And we aren't several years from now. This is today, those are today visa/mastercard numbers, and we are gaining volume today. 


You are fucking nuts. You lose all credibility with that statement.  We already have that system. My franchised node of the central bank is called Wells Fargo. They don't listen to consumer needs any better than their competition. 


It's not as far off as you think. If you propose on chain scaling *before* the advent of Segwit, especially with the idea of EC, you are a fool. What exchange do you run? I'd like to ensure you never get anywhere near my money.

You are signing transactions, for the purpose of sending bitcoins, with the keys that are intended to send bitcoins. You are using bitcoin.
 


It doesn't matter. If someone has your keys, they can spend your bitcoins on chain anyways. If you are arguing semantics that any transaction not "on chain" isn't bitcoin, I'm not interested. A centralized node blockchain system isn't bitcoin. Bitcoin is a ***decentralized*** P2P payment platform. LN does not change that. Peers, are still paying peers. With centralized nodes, it is a peer to trusted node to trusted node to peer platform which is exactly what we have now. I don't care how inefficient or slow it is, we *will not* transition to that, because that isn't bitcoin. If that's what you all want, you are going to need to fork off, because I can guarantee you there is a significant portion of the user base who doesn't. It will forever be a contentious fork.




No, that's a terrible example. What it is more like, is a multi key safety deposit box that you and the other actor use. You both pull money out of your accounts, and put the cash in a safety deposit box with a divide. Side 1 is yours, Side 2 is theres. It will only open with a key to both sides. Everytime you make a transaction, you both open the box, and you both agree to move the correct amount from one side to the other accordingly. When you don't want to play anymore, you simply tell the bank, who can also open the other parties side, and the bank deposits the money on your side into your account, and the money on the other side's to their account. It is literally no different. You are signing a transaction, to transmit bitcoin, and when you are ready to update the ledger, you update it. But the only way that you can access it again is by publishing that ledger. Otherwise the bitcoin was locked in a transaction on the blockchain. There is absolutely no way to get the other person's money without them signing it over to you. Zip dot zero ways. Payment channels *are already possible*, it is just very hard to implement a reliable payment layer with it with malleability.
***Your coins are being transmitted on the blockchain, during the final transaction, just as they would be onchain without a lightning transaction.***

Because it's technologically infeasible to increase block sizes and remain as decentralized as it is now. 
Meanwhile, technologies like LN allow for people to "buy coffee", more privately than being on chain, instantly, for literally zero fee. 
Like it or not, on chain transactions are a limited resource. That's not debatable. What is (relatively) debatable is *how limited* it is. Objective evidence shows 4MB starts showing real decline in the feasibility to run a node. You are free to run any transaction on chain, but just like anything else that is limited, it's not going to be free. Bitcoin isn't a charity. 
Besides, do you really want the world to know how much you enjoy coffee? Do you really want to wait at least 10 minutes at the cash register before your payment is picked up by a block? 30 minutes before you are a confirmed non criminal? When there's already technology out there, to allow for instant transactions, completely trustless, peer to peer, without the prying eyes of someone monitoring the blockchain? I don't understand the draw of "buying coffee" on chain.

If you take even a portion of the amount of value of the asset classes bitcoin could potentially take a bite out of, then bitcoin is severely undervalued. Like absurdly undervalued. It would be like you finding a place to buy legitimate gold for $5 per ounce, and then selling it for a $10/oz. 
Most people are just waiting until the market hits that special number in their head before they plan to sell. For some people that's 5-10k, others it is 100k, others it's 500k, and some even believe it is 1M+. Everyone has their price. As long as liquidity is there and there's ways to cash out, the value will remain high. At some point, after mass adoption, bitcoin will find its true market value, and the volatile will be like that of a PM. At mass adoption point, .0028 BTC is also the amount everyone would have if it were distributed easily, so having 1BTC will put you way ahead of that curve. 
Bitcoin will continue to have massive rises, and sharp corrections as people reach that special number in their head, and overtime distribution will normalize. There will still be a 1%, but that's really no different than what we have now with fiat.

Running a node means you are in charge of your money. If you aren't running a node, you are depending on other people to tell you the truth about your money. A node validates each and every transaction, all of the way from the beginning of bitcoin,, including all of yours.

Segwit is the only actual scaling proposal that carries any serious weight at the moment, and any other off chain scaling depends on malleability to be fixed, so when market advantage starts to drop, and there is an immediate fix available, people will go with it. 
I'm not sure if you can classify bitcoin's advantage as "unfair". Not exactly why you would consider being literally the platform the entire field was based on as an "unfair" (i.e. "Unearned") advantage. And if the scaling issue is of alarming concern, then the market would show that. 
Right now, with the massive increases in price, it seems like the majority of its value is derived from being decentralized and a store of value than it is a spending mechanism. So while microtransactions are of concern at some point in the future, when the coin is ~150x less than it's potential value, they are not as much of concern as protecting the decentralization concerns.

I'd love to see your reference on "studies" because [bitfury did one not too long ago that showed 4MB blocks was the practical limit]( If there is an updated study I'd love to see it. 
And miners don't do anything. Miners provide valid blocks to the network. That's all. And after this fiasco, they won't even implement network changes. They proved they can't handle that responsibility. 
Nodes enforce their own rules, and by default, offer the security of the network because nothing is more secure than trusting only yourself. The only thing miners do is appease you and others by offering up blocks that abide by your rules.
Mining is severely overrated. The cryptography of PKI secures bitcoin. Higher hash rate simply makes it harder for any one person to control a majority of the hash rate, but if a few already do, then it's really pointless beyond their own monetary investment in not killing bitcoin. Mining will decentralize with time now that we have hit Moore's law. But increasing block sizes to a point where we see an effect on the ability to run a node would be fucking stupid.

***The nodes of the economic majority aren't with them. They would be mining worthless blocks.***


***Because the nodes of the economic majority do not allow them to. If you open that door to allow blocks to expand, based off of the number of nodes supporting it, you open the door for miners to simply block you out of running a node.***


I think your lack of fear shows a general misunderstanding of the purpose of bitcoin, which is a trustless, peer to peer payment system. It does that just fine right now. Just yesterday, I send over $6000, each transaction in just 30 minutes, for less than $5 total. No one asked me why/who I was sending the money for. No one asked me to sign any piece of paper. I didn't ask permission from anyone. Tell me, do you know of another system, that can do that *as securely* as bitcoin?
Do you contend that increasing the block size decreases the number of nodes on the network in at least some direct correlation? Because if you don't understand that, you are severely undereducated in the topic of distributed computing networks, and this conversation is over.
Running a node *is* running bitcoin. If you are not running a node, you are trusting someone else. I don't know about you, but I trust very few people when it comes to my money.

Bitcoin isn't, and was never intended to be a charity. Sure many idealists proposed it to be, but they were wrong. 
Bitcoin is a decentralized peer to peer value storage and transfer protocol. And currently it does that quite well. I sent a few thousand dollars to another address a couple days ago, and no one asked me why, who I was sending it to, told me I couldn't, and in top of that *purely as a bonus* it happened in under an hour, for about a dollar worth of fees. Bitcoin is working phenomenally as is, for its intended purpose. 
It never promised to be cheaper than other services, or faster than other services. It promised to be decentralized, and have a fixed limit. Those two features are what give it the majority of their value. I'm not saying that ease of use and speed don't affect the value, but they are secondary and must remain secondary to the primary features. While it would be nice to have every transaction be free and fast, if you sacrifice your core goals (decentralization and maximum limit), then you change the project and its value substantially. The chances of those changes being made on chain are looking more and more slim. Just like early cell phones were expensive because of technical limitations, early bitcoin transactions are going to be expensive until layers are built on top. 
There's technical limitations in reality, and those need to be realized.

On 8/1/17 BIP148 will be run by a large portion of the users, splitting the chain into one that has Segwit, and one that doesn't. 
If that chain gets longer than the legacy chain, all the blocks on the legacy chain after that split disappear. That could happen in 2 days or 2 years, but once it does, anything that miners mined on the old chain will go away. It is to their advantage to mine on the BIP148 chain, especially if they already support Segwit. Most of them are using larger blocks as an excuse to block Segwit. But it's clear most users want Segwit and the ability to run a node, and the users bring the value, so chances are they will either fold or die before 8/1/17. They are on the losing side here.

If your argument is to make bitcoin as a substitute for cash in Japan, then Lightning Network is really all that can be said. 
No one in their right mind would chose bitcoin over cash for daily transactions if it takes 10-30 minutes and a fee (fees won't ever go away for on chain transactions). They would store value in bitcoin, make online transactions, and pay large transactions and cash out of it. But on chain bitcoin alone is a terrible substitute for cash. On chain bitcoin is an excellent decentralized store of value and an excellent alternative to settlement networks like ACH.

That's bitcoin. It's working perfectly. 
On the other hand, bitcoin in its purest form would never replace visa. Let's pretend for a second you can have decentralization and on chain scaling (you cant), you still have a fee to pay, and time to wait. Bitcoin seems a hell of a lot more like a settlement network than a payment platform. 
L2 technologies however, would allow instant payments, and cheap if not 0 transaction costs. They are a sweet benefit to an already working perfectly platform. Those could then allow bitcoin to compete with credit cards, giving it even more value. 
But if you want to send money quickly and cheaply, with no regards to centralization, bitcoin isn't your platform. It literally can't be by the fixed principals of the platform.

It will depend on the sending and receiving node, and which chain they are operating on. 
From the first non Segwit block mines forward, there are going to be differences between the chains. If you plan on spending post split, look into splitting your coins which involves sending the coins to the same address, on two different nodes, one running BIP148, and one not, and then sending the coins to a different destination from each node. From that point, you will have the coins in different locations, on each chains, and the transaction on one chain would not be valid on the other. 
If you plan on selling one coin for the other, you need to ensure that the exchange you are using will be supporting each coin individually. Then you would deposit the coins that you want to sell, selling those coins for another, and then having those new coins sent to your node on the corresponding chain.

You may think it is absurd but the topic has already been brought up numerous times by numerous figures in the BU realm. And why wouldn't it? You have two options to compensate miners, block reward and transaction fees. If fees go down, then the only way to survive is block reward. You can bet your ass soon after the control of block limits, and subsequently nodes, that a permanent inflation would be proposed and probably passed, and without running a node you would have zero say in the matter. That is why it is crucial to keep blocks small enough for the economic majority to represent their interests directly. 
And you are correct they can already choose block size but right now they can point at the hard limit right now as the problem. Keeping the status quo is just fine for them, and BU would be a wet dream for them. Make no mistake, their priorities are not making transactions cheap for you. If EC was reality you can bet within a year block sizes would be ramped up substantially, pointing at lower transaction costs as their reasoning, and when the halvening comes in 3.5 years, there's a perfect reason to tighten back up and increase fees again. When resistance comes again, they just propose a lift of the 21M cap, and because they control most the nodes, it gets through no problem, and then the only there's really nothing beyond market forces standing in their way to make block sizes smaller again anyways. 
Obviously that would likely be the death of bitcoin at that point, but it's the result of what happens when you cater to the interests of on power too much in a game theory situation.

Because the draw to bitcoin is and should always remain a decentralized value store/transfer protocol. It's not an investment scheme, or a get rich quick scheme. The price rise is a result of the market realizing its utility, nothing more. 
Placing the rapid price rise front and center to the public does more harm than good. There's going to be a point where bitcoin reaches its market value, and then levels off with very modest constant growth over time. The sooner we get there, the better for everyone.

Segwit currently has around 40%, and if this chain gets longer than the main chain at any point in the future, the entire legacy chain gets reorged and any miner who mined coins on that chain loses all of their coins. That could happen after two days or two years. 
It makes much more sense for those signaling for Segwit to mine on the BIP148 chain, and get an early advantage on the block reward, than to mine on a chain that could go away. Especially because miners realize Segwit is inevitable. The 30% signaling nothing are going to need to chose, and likely they will chose to mine on BIP148 too.

Now you are extrapolating that example too far. The only comparison is that new technologies are expensive.
There's technical limitations to the block size. That's not debatable. Why not just increase a block to 1GB? The answer to that is that everyone accepts that there's an upper limit. What's that upper limit. Objective studies show that 4MB would already be pushing the limits of most nodes. So we have to deal with that. 
Maybe LN can't handle the world load. But maybe 3rd layer technologies can. But the fact of the matter is that there's limitations right now that make it expensive. Does it suck? Sure. But it also sucks that I don't have wings, I don't have 4 arms, etc etc. but we deal with it and adapt. BU would be disastrous. If it is possible to expand the block size in an alternate method, please, seriously, propose it. Everyone is listening. 
But given the two options, Segwit is light years past any other proposals. And to refuse it, is just irresponsible at this point. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:02:56
2MB would be the base block size, if you include witness data, that could get to 8MB. Very quickly approaching that data cap just to run a full node. And that's with modern day infrastructure. Africa? Forget about it.

With visa, there are no fees from a user standpoint only accepter standpoint, it is instant, and I actually get cash back. And the only people who can view my spending is visa and the government with a subpoena. 
With bitcoin, fees will never be below $.20 on chain ever again (unless of course we lift the coin limit), transactions take 10 minutes at the minimum, and with blocks that big count on a lot of orphaned blocks, so most likely 30-40 before truly confirmed. And anyone who has my address can track all of my spending.

Bitcoin the protocol is a settlement network. Plain and simple. 
Payment methods include the following:
Cash, credit cards, wire transfer, paypal, Venmo
They all are just about instant, or much faster, mostly free, and mostly private, more so than bitcoin could ever be, because of the nature of on chain transactions. 
There will always be fees, always be 10-30 minute wait time, and funds can always be traced. And increasing block sizes to handle capacity only centralizes it, getting rid of its only real benefit.
ACH is a settlement network, that is the bedrock for all of the above technologies. Every night, it updates accounts across the world with transactions. It's slow, it cost money, but it works. Bitcoin blows ACH out of the water. We don't take 24 hours, we do it in 10-30 minutes. There's a built in, immutable paper trail, and it is the most secure platform on the planet because it is decentralized and everyone can deal with it directly. 
Bitcoin (capital B) has the ability to allow for many different platforms to be built on top of the settlement network, and better yet, people can interact and spend bitcoin (lowercase b) with Bitcoin if they want/need to. 
Scaling on chain and retaining decentralization is impossible without waiting for consumer technology to catch up. What is possible today, is level 2 technologies that allow for massive scaling (more than we could ever do on chain) within a few weeks time. And as consumer hardware improves, block sizes can increase accordingly, as long as it never becomes infeasible for anyone to run a node for a reasonable price. 
If you are using **b**itcoin without a node, you are depending on someone to use **B**itcoin for you, and tell you the truth. If anyone tells you otherwise, they are lying and want to tell you what you can do with your money. 95% of users need to be capable of running a node for bitcoin to work in a truly and ideologically "decentralized, peer to peer" fashion. Increasing blocksizes to allow for nodes to fall off is not an option.

If that is a writing prompt, I'd have a qualifier paper, arguing that frankly, it doesn't matter if they do or don't. Bring in the Barbra Streisand effect, the fact that people invest in other commodities, and the fact that just about anything can be used as money if people believe they can exchange it for something of value later. Talk about how being decentralized in nature it makes it a perfect candidate for a/the world reserve currency for which all other currencies are based off of. And again, hammer in the point that bitcoin returns the concept of store of value to the people in the same way that gold does, with limited risk of holding the physical asset (heavy/risk of mugging), and a much easier way to pay people with it (8 decimal places, which could easily be changed in the future if needed.

Those are nodes running BU with 1MB blocks. You seem to not understand that there are physical and technical limitations to the block size. Literally, just like it's impossible for someone to bench press 500 tons, there's an upper limit for the block size too. Objective studies show that 4MB is that limit. 
We don't increase block sizes now because Segwit and LN are already scaling solutions, and we can gauge the need to increase the block size based off of how much the demand is afterwards.

You clearly are not an engineer. Safety is always 100% top priority if for no other reason but to avoid being sued. I'm in construction and we will fire people on the spot for willfully violating PPE rules. Doesn't matter how efficient you are at your job. Factors of safety are at least 5X on engineered objects that already have their 5X safety factor on material rated at 10X safety factor.  We plan lifts with cranes at 85% of rated capacity, which is typically 3X safety factor of actual capacity, and anything above 50% has a lot of highly paid people signing off on it. 
I'm not sure what universe you live in where you think everything is engineered to utility, but I can assure you, safety is always top priority because lawsuits are fucking expensive.

All transactions on lighting can only be signed with your bitcoin private keys. So if someone has that, then your coins would be gone anyways. LN just keeps resigning a newer transaction status. It is no different from bitcoin, except you are only publishing a net amount at the closing of the channel.
Easy scenario:
Google opens up GooglePay. You add your GooglePay LN link to your wallet just like adding a browser plugin, with an initial amount you want to have open ($100 or so). The coins are still in your control, and you can close out without spending a dime. 
If Coffee Shop X accepts "GooglePay" in addition to Visa, cash, etc., you simply pay GooglePay the transaction, and it updates the LN with the current amount. Google also has a LN connection open with CoffeeShop X and sends them the money (minus a penny fee maybe). This can continue as many times as you want, until you close out the account with google pay, or need to add funds, in which case the closing transaction and subsequent reopening transaction are sent on chain.

Incorrect. [Less than 12% of gold is used for industrial uses.]( 34% is used for investment purposes explicitly, and the remaining 52% is used for jewelry... And why do people buy gold jewelry? Because it's expensive... Because it's made of gold... And they expect gold to retain it's value (investment purposes). And the amount of gold used in industry is decreasing rapidly, especially as we move from analog to digital signals, and digital signals don't depend on the degree of conductive accuracy of analog signals. Gold has value because it is expensive to mine, and people expect it to hold value because it has always held value.


Ok, well if you found an undiscovered artist, who had work of the same level as that of Picaso (verified by experts in art), and they were selling their art at $10 a pop, it would make sense to make the argument "If this guy becomes half as popular as Picaso, this painting will be worth $X". Again, we are comparing things of similar qualities. The Mona Lisa has nothing in common with the US housing market. Bitcoin and Gold are in fact very similar. The market cap of Bitcoin, is substantially smaller than the valuation of any other financial instrument, and we can compare it to that of a corporation, under the understanding that we can reasonably expect bitcoin to become a global reserve asset (as is gold). If we are then pricing things in relation to bitcoin, it makes sense that companies that do value in currencies that are priced in relation to bitcoin can be priced in relation to bitcoin, at least in some capacity.

Just because someone says something doesn't make it true. Especially just because they put it into an online article. 
Their point makes logically no sense. Hardware wallets are technically a centralized method of long term storage. Software wallets are essentially a centralized version of storage and sending. Exchanges are a centralized method to facilitate trade. But they all depend on a decentralized protocol level, where anyone can use it to freely make a competitive option to other centralized options. It isn't "centralization" that is the problem. It is *forced* centralization. 
Right now, the only two options are LN/Segwit, or status quo, because it is mathematically provable that block sizes that aren't just marginally significant leads to forced centralization of nodes.

Well anyone can, and will fork off bitcoin code. In fact Litecoin code *is bitcoin* with very very slight changes to the overall metrics. But again, because of the way bitcoin works, you can't spend Litecoin on the bitcoin protocol. 
Even if I was to make a complete copy of bitcoin, same exact code, I could not send any of my bitcoin 2.0 on the original bitcoin chain. Because bitcoin works by referencing previous transactions, all the way back to the time that bitcoin was added to the chain by the miners. I can run a parallel chain, call it bitcoin, and it can have the exact same code, but if someone is running a bitcoin node (which they should, *especially* if they accept payments frequently) there is no possible way for me to send my coins to that person. Think of it like sending email. Email communication can be used as valid court evidence that you said something. Because without your password (private key), no one is capable of sending email from your address, on your behalf. Someone can spoof the email field, or make the email look similar enough to trick people, but they will never be able to actually send email from your address. So to rope that argument back in, as long as you accept the idea that "bitcoin" has 21M coins, even if that chain splits, you can stick with the chain you believe to be the true bitcoin, and it will only ever have 21M units. 
Also, yes, I am very long on bitcoin. Like 10-15 years long, plan to buy a Big Mac with 5 bits as my first purchase long. Quite frankly I don't care about the short term. In my opinion, bitcoin is severely undervalued for my timeline. I alike it to gold, but because of the fact that it cannot be faked on the protocol, it is much harder to manipulate.
I don't see bitcoin as a "currency" at the moment. It can get there, and believe it will, but when the potential value of something is $500k to $1M+ and we are at a $3000 ceiling, it's going to make for a terrible currency. My visa is instant and I get cash back. But I'm not storing value with my visa. All other currencies were originally backed by some sort of asset, so I think bitcoin would need to reach "asset" class, and find its market value before anyone begins really using it. And the value bitcoin would have at that point is astronomically higher than it is now. Which is why scaling doesn't matter to me. We are in the times of dial up modems and cli for blockchains. Infrastructure will catch up. Software will be developed. And by the time it is truly ready for currency level use because it reaches its market value as a store of value, we will have AC wifi level infrastructure in place to handle the scale. 
And yes, for laymans, it's not exactly intuitive, but it's far from difficult now. Something as simple as a hardware wallet is pretty much fool proof, and is much much more secure than any layman would ever have. 
In my eyes, all of this bickering about scaling, and market cap is just short sighted nonsense. Bitcoin is the best coin at what it does best, which is decentralized/secure store/transfer of value. And I think everything else will branch off from that. I see a future with many different coins that do many different things, and "value" is thought in terms of "bits" on the bitcoin protocol.

Bitcoin was never about moving away from greed. In fact, the very fundamentals of bitcoin depend on everyone looking out for their own self interest. 
Bitcoin was about moving away from money that was literally backed by nothing, and forced upon us through debt that we didn't want but had no choice for. Moving away from a system that sells bonds backed by nothing, to fund wars over nothing and making the tax payers pay it back with interest. 
Greed never went away and will never go away. Greed in the hands of the people is good. Coercion based greed is bad.

The altcoin inflation argument is fucking stupid. 
No amount of altcoins can change the value of bitcoin. That's like saying because I start printing my own currency, it somehow inflates the dollar.
Being able to send bitcoin on the Bitcoin protocol requires bitcoin and only bitcoin. No amount of Litecoin, or Ethereum or whatever else can change that. There will only ever be 21M bitcoins. End of story. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:54:07
To answer your first question, no it is not possible to reuse old coins. Bitcoin works with inputs and outputs. The outputs of one transaction are used as the inputs of another transaction. When you make a transaction, you reference a transaction made to an address that you have the private key to. You then tell that tx to output to multiple addresses that you may or may not have control over. However, the previous input is used up, and you have a new output that would be used as an input in another transaction. 
If a tx is confirmed, then the next block will include the hash of the block it was confirmed in. The block after that will contain that block, which by default contains the original block. Blocks are stacked on and on, and it is mathematically provable that the transaction took place, with more and more certainty with each block. If a tx is not confirmed, the inputs are never spent, and the inputs can be used in another transaction until they are spent.

LN will have interconnected hubs, but you have the option to also pay on chain if you like. The decentralization is based in the nodes. If you aren't receiving your bitcoin to a node, you aren't doing much different of a system than what we currently have with our banking network. 
Scaling on chain however, is still 100% traceable, will always take 30+ minutes for confirmations, and will always have fees, and guarantees centralization because it isn't feasible to run a node. 
LN also leads to the possibility of atomic transactions which essentially open every other alt to be an avenue of transfer for bitcoin. I think this is the largest potential in the long run.

There's a difference between being coerced into doing something, or criminal negligence. 
As was always the right of uses, and the entire concept of bitcoin, I will be running a BIP148 node and enforcing the rules that I believe should make a block valid. This will happen on 8/1/17. Developers have offered plenty of times to assist exchanges/wallets with this transition. They have known this will happen for over 3 months now. 
If they choose to do nothing, knowing this is going to happen, and their customers suffer for it, that is about as clear cut criminal negligence as it gets.

Regardless, by the time mass adoption comes along, we may have bitcoin validating ICs built into each and every piece of hardware like a bluetooth IC is baked into everything now, and bandwidth will be a non issue. At that point, we block size away. But at no point should we sacrifice the ability to run a fully validating node that can decide it's own consensus rules, for the exact reason of BIP148. Whether you support it or not, you cannot deny it has played a significant role in pushing the miner's hand into action. And the likelihood of using BIP 9 to make any more changes is very slim, so it will be important that all users have a say in the validation of blocks.

It can be pumped, but if there's no value it's all hot air. Trust me, I own a fair amount of ETH, and have sold off *a lot* and am still amazed at how detached from reality ETH is. The flippening would be great for me. But I'm not buying more Ethereum because I understand the underlying metrics and know that it's current demand for its stated purpose does not justify its demand. And if Ethereum wants to encroach on bitcoin's secure/decentralized store/transfer of value, it can't even hold a candle in comparison and fails every time.
That doesn't mean that I am going to say it won't go to $1000 before it corrects itself, and I hope it does, so I can profit some more, but ETH has never experienced a speculative bubble pop, and it is coming. Eths killer app is speculation. Speculating future dapps, speculating the tokens of daps themselves, etc etc. and there's nothing wrong with that. ICOs are going to play a role in the future for venture capital, and Ethereum will play a significant role as a worldwide virtual machine. But it isn't there now, and it won't be for a while, and once the house of cards starts to slip, much of the newbie money rolling into Ethereum will be coming right back out. When the primary focus of a coin is having a larger market cap than another coin's, when your coin was founded for an entirely different purpose, there's an issue. Ethereum is like that douche who soups up his pickup truck. Sure he can make it pretty fast, but in the end, the platform wasn't designed for it, and over time it will lose to something whose platform was designed for it. 
All I'm saying is don't expect for this to last forever. Shortly after the overcome of bitcoin's market cap, people will begin to sell and it will all come crashing down. I have no doubt it will pass bitcoin, just not at a sustainable level.

Drug dealers have been known to use tide laundry detergent as a currency. That doesn't make it an optimal currency. Just because Ethereum *works* as a currency doesn't mean that it competes with bitcoin in any other way other than transaction speed, and that's only until it hits its 15 tx/s limit, and then their scaling problem is magnitudes harder because of the sacrifices they made for the faster block time. 
The real value comes from its "virtual machine" aspect, but the primary focus right now is to "beat bitcoin" and "the flippening" which is an awful goal because bitcoin is superior in the realm of store of value, and scaling is easier on bitcoin than Ethereum. 
ETH has long term viability, but in the short term, one can expect it to drop sharply when the goal of passing bitcoins market cap is met (it will, don't underestimate the volume of money stupid people will throw away) and the euphoria wears off. To me that is a money making opportunity. Take the profits and buy back after the crash.

When you spent them, you told coinbase where to send coins, and they took a big chunk input, 30BTC, signed it with ***their*** private key because its *their* bitcoin, and paid the person on your behalf, and credited your account. 
Does this work? Yes. But when coinbase gets hacked, and they lose bitcoins, they may not have enough to give you what they sold you. This wouldn't be the first time this ever happens.

There will only ever be ever so slightly less than 21M coins in existence, and there are currently about 16.3M, and it grows by 12.5 every 10 minutes give or take. The final coins will be mined sometime around 2140. Since it is based on block height, not actual time, it is hard to extrapolate that many ~10 minute blocks forward to an exact time. 
With that being said, price is directly driven by supply and demand. Supply is in terms of the amount of bitcoin available *for sale* at the time. I have control over my coins, so they aren't *for sale*, at least not for an amount that any rational person could get them elsewhere for. So even though there is a market price for bitcoin, my coins are only actually worth their utility to me. That utility could be in selling them for the market rate, or storing my value, and any other number of use cases. The same applies for lost coins. They really have no value to anyone, but because they will never make it onto a market, they can be thought of just being held by someone who will never sell. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:58:27
Bitcoin will need to reach its market value of an asset that there are only 21M of, that is supposed to be a universal understanding of value. Note that comparing marketcaps of gold and bitcoin alone that would put bitcoin at $500K per bitcoin.
So bitcoin is much more an investment at this point than a currency, because no one spends something that should be worth much more in the near future. 
Paper money was originally a stand in for gold, so bitcoin will need to reach asset class status as well before it acts like a global currency. After a US bear market, and the subsequent safe havening of bitcoin, I think a tipping point will be reached and it will ascend to asset status and volatility will level out and it will be viable as a currency.

This asset class was already "discredited" in 2015. Funny thing with P2P is it's a hell of a lot harder to stop than just pulling the plug.

If you want to know about portion being "used" that's just as hard as figuring out how many dollars are being used. There is a figure called "coin days destroyed" which counts the amount of days since the coins last moved and adds them to the figure. It helps give an idea of volume. If volume is high and there's a large number of coin days destroyed you know that people are moving coins that were previously idle.

The "economic majority" in the sense you are referring to it (the uneducated masses that use services instead of nodes) don't use bitcoin on a daily basis. They buy a little bit as an "investment" and then forget about it. So the active userbase is really the only one that matters in this case. 
In the case of a split, I along with many other users will be dumping my legacy coins, and there will be a dip in its price. Most actively involved users have a substantial amount of coins because we bought early. Those semi active but non informed users will panic sell and exasperate the dip. Services don't matter at all. There's already a few places that support both which is all that we need. 
If services don't support the 148 chain, and their customers lose money because of it, I would peg that responsibility on them because of criminal negligence. They will have known for 3 months that this is happening. Developers have offered to help with the event and ensure their customers are safe.

You should not use the legacy chain unless you are absolutely clear that the UASF has failed. 
In fact, any commerce at all on either chain should be postponed until things are figured out. It will be clear fairly quickly what will happen. Most likely within minutes. No miner worth their salt will remain on the legacy chain if there's a single chance in hell that UASF succeeds. 
If the chain splits you have the exact same amount of coins you originally had on each chain. If one chain disappears, you still have the exact same amount of coins you had prior to the split if you do nothing. The only way you lose coins is if you gamble on one chain or the other, or buy coins post split on the "wrong" chain.

You *do know* that bitcoin is the *purest form* of capitalism, correct? Individual ownership and control of capital value, with no one telling what you can/can't do with it is quite literally *the definition of capitalism*.
Bitcoin just circumvents *crony capitalism*, where only those with connections get the benefits, and the losses are socialized.

Miners are free to disagree, but we know that there is a demand for Segwit activated bitcoin, so there's going to be miners who follow as well.

Do you understand how bitcoin works? Because you don't rely on anyone else to authenticate incoming bitcoin. What do you think the purpose of a fully validating node is? Lol pot, meet kettle...


No, it is a value transfer protocol. The implementation of it may be a currency, but it is literally a protocol that allows for the ownership and transfer of value. If you create a transaction that conforms to the protocol, you can send value. And no, my bank account is a central authority signifying that I have deposited a certain amount of money with them. My bitcoin addresses are private keys with value that I can mathematically prove, independent of any and all third parties that I own, and where I got them from. Big difference.


I think you are confused. Bitcoin is not money. It is a number attached to a private key, with a quantity that is verifiably owned because of that private key. Such a system just so happens to work very well as a currency.


Ok, please do. And when you open up that output transaction, and it comes from an input value of 100+ BTC, explain where the rest of that goes... You don't own the bitcoin, again, by definition of the protocol. If you can't spend that 100 BTC input independently, then you own an IOU from someone who owns bitcoin. Very simple.


No, I just understand how bitcoin works. Clearly you don't. If you can't create a transaction by directly signing for an input with the correct amount of bitcoin to satisfy the transaction, then someone else owns the bitcoin for you, and you *trust* them. Please, go read the whitepaper.


You: I'd like to take all of my bitcoin out.
Coinbase: No
You: But it's *my* bitcoin
Coinbase: We don't care. We are suspicious of your activities. Therefor we froze your account.

@_date: 2017-06-04 18:11:28
Sure. Entropy is a measure of disorder. The second law of thermodynamics states that within a closed system, all things move towards increasing entropy. 
Imagine standing in a room and lighting a match. If we were to call the room our "closed system", and we do not allow any energy/mass in or out, we can assume that all of the energy released from combustion of the march is still within that room. But the room probably doesn't increase in temperature at all. You cannot reverse that chemical reaction of the match either. That would violate increasing entropy. That heat *was* concentrated, and could have been used for something, such as continuing a combustion reaction on a candle, however now it is completely disorganized, and cannot do anything. Try as you might, holding a candle in the room that you just released all the energy from a match in, that candle will not begin to combust. That entropy creates what we call "exergy" which is essentially "destroyed usefulness" of energy, in the exact amount of energy that was released from the match. In powerplants, we use combustion to then make steam, and that steam then turns a turbine which turns a generator. But any exergy created is energy "lost" forever. 
All things move towards increasing entropy. In computers, as electrons flow through as current, they are throttled back with "resistors" which quite literally cause friction at an electron level, and that energy is lost. That is what we detect as electronics heat. But because some of the energy into a computer is used for processing, the amount released from a resistor is not enough to boil water, which is really our most useful process of harnessing heat energy into mechanical/electrical energy. 
Really, the only thing computer waste heat is good for, is a mediocre space heater.

Listen to me very carefully: ***On chain transactions will never compete with Visa***
10-30 minutes for confirmation, 100% traceable by anyone, and there will ***always*** be a fee (I get cash back with my Visa). Those things are unchangeable. Bitcoin doesn't work *without* fees.

I think the fact that it is the original crypto. It is *the* bitcoin. And by being open source it sets the bar for all others. Want to compete? Better do it with open source that bitcoin could steal if need be. 
You don't see countries "adopting" Ethereum. Bitcoin has 8 years and has proven to pull through multiple bubbles and a long bear run. Ethereum on the other hand is over hyped and under utilized *in the sense it was designed for*. It was never designed to be a currency/store of value. Sure it can do as such, but the reason it has faster transactions is because it made tradeoffs in areas that bitcoin didn't. Ethereum is without a doubt more centralized. Anyone who tells you different, refer them to the hard fork. Ethereum can handle 5x the transaction volume now, but 15 tx/s is still only 7% of Visa. And their scaling problem is going to be massively more complex, because of those tradeoffs they made. Same with Litecoin. You can't change some things without breaking others. There's a *reason* bitcoin has a 10 minute block time and a 1 MB block size. It's by design. It's not a design flaw. There's a reason it's so hard to get consensus for scaling. It's by design. It's not a design flaw. 
Bitcoin is without a doubt the most secure, decentralized store of value asset on the planet. End of story. And maybe right now we pay that price with expensive transactions and high fees until internet infrastructure fixes that. And maybe there isn't as much demand for bitcoin level security for everyone so there is room for other crypto currencies. But just like there's a need for gold and a need for silver, but you can't substitute silver for gold, there's a need for bitcoin, and there's a need for alts, but you can't send either on each other's block chains. 
Think of this like competing countries currencies. Just because any country can issue as much currency as they want has little effect on the value of the USD. If there's a demand for a real USD, then that USD is going to be worth something and printing more pesos isn't going to change that. 
I by no means am a bitcoin maximalist. I think there should be many alts and all these currencies should focus on something they do really, really well, and with Segwit, we use atomic transactions to use currencies as we wish, with the properties they have. Does that mean that bitcoin won't have all the value in the world? Sure. But bitcoin is, always will be, and always should be, the value amount everything else is compared to. Because that's bitcoins best app: a perfectly secure store/transfer of value.

Not even going to read the article but the title is patently false. It simply adds another way to be taxed in bitcoin. 
If it qualifies as money, than any that you acquired through doing something for them qualifies as "earned income" most likely of the value they were worth at the time. This is taxed at your typical tax rate, and adds to any other income that you may have.
This is contrary to currently, how bitcoin is treated like property and is subject to capital gains. Forex (Foreign currency exchange) is treated as property and is subject to capital gains as well, and is likely how the government will view unearned bitcoin, being that it is a "foreign"/non sovereign currency.
So really the only thing that happens with bitcoin being qualified as a "currency" rather than just "property" is it opens the door to being taxed as "earned income" which is taxed at a higher rate. Currently, long term capital gains (&gt; 1 yr) are taxed at a lower rate than short term capital gains and if I remember correctly, short term capital gains is 20% maximum and can be as low as 0% if you are in the lowest tax bracket, but regardless they are substantially lower than earned income tax rates. 
Long story short, this is just the government being more greedy.

You should care a lot more about memory than storage. Storage is cheap and is getting cheaper. You can run a full node in pruned mode, and still get full security as long as you originally had the full blockchain before pruning. 
Memory on the other hand, is much more pricey, and typically limited on most computers. You will see the effects of BU blocks much more on memory/CPU usage than you will on storage size. The ability for someone to run a full node that can validate large blocks every 10 minutes decreases substantially and electricity/hardware costs become an issue. Storage of the blockchain, I can buy a 2TB hard drive right now for $80 and never worry about it again. With 32MB blocks and rising (Visa would be 250MB blocks theoretical minimum) you are talking about an enterprise data connection, substantial amounts of RAM and a rather power intensive CPU. Next thing you know you will be paying to access a node because that is the only way it is viable for anyone to run one. Wells Fargo would offer node service, Chase, Bank of America etc. next thing you know we are right back to where we were before.

Lightning network uses the idea of payment channels, the back and forth off chain movement of coins between two parties. 
If I then open a channel with a hub, who has a channel open with my friend, I can pay the hub the coins, and the hub can then pay my friend to the same amount of coins instantly and very cheaply/freely depending on their profit model. You can mathematically prove that when you as A, pay the hub B, that B pays C, your friend. Also, because of the way payment channels work, you never leave custodial control over your coins. It is different from current banking because at no time do you ever need to trust anyone else with your money. ***When you initiate a payment channel, you "lock" coins up with an on chain transaction. When you close out a channel, you then publish another closing transaction on chain, and the net amount owed to you is payed from the other end of the channel. So basically, you are putting money into escrow, with the escrow being the blockchain, and then coming back at a later date with the other party in the channel and both agreeing who should get what from that initial amount.***
The main problem with LN right now, is that while it is possible to prove that the funds either were or were not sent from B to C, it is not possible to *enforce* that they send these coins to C. You still need to have trust in the hub that you are using that they will pay who they say they will pay. For that reason, it would most likely only be used for small, semi-trust, daily transfers. If you are buying a car or something, paying for an on chain transaction would be worth it. 
LN will release pressure because all of these little transactions that people make can all be made faster and cheaper off chain. Bitcoin fees are not based on the amount of money being send, but the number of inputs and outputs. So the more and more bitcoin is fragmented into smaller amounts, there's always a "combining" transaction that will be quite costly. With LN, it would likely be settling large amounts, or you would be sending large amounts, which is usually stored in the form of a single larger input. Because fees are relative to the size of the tx, fees in relation to settlement transactions and large on chain transactions that need blockchain security, would be quite small percentage wise, even though it may be like $10-20 to spend. But the average on chain transaction would probably be $1000+, so you are looking at 1-2%. 
Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks of a distributed ledger system is that it takes time to propagate that ledger. Any other alt coin that can transfer money in seconds is giving up something in order to do that. They will run into issues at some point down the line, most likely scaling, when it gets to that point. On chain bitcoin acts much more like a settlement network than a cash like system. Txs will always take 10-30 minutes, there will always be a fee which will rise as the block reward decreases in time, and you can always trace bitcoin 100%. Those things are fundamental to bitcoin itself and can never change. LN would help it compete with cash, being based on the settlement layer. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:35:00
Ethereum doesn't do what bitcoin does. Plain and simple.
If you want fast, easy transactions, use visa. Hell, visa pays me cash back to use them. 
If you want decentralized and secure, that holds value use bitcoin. Ethereum has built in inflation, has shown to be susceptible to the will of a select few, and very soon will become susceptible to centralization as those with the most coins will get to mine blocks for more coins. 
Ethereum and bitcoin are two completely different things and both serve different purposes. The fact that bitcoin is still in a stalemate is a testament to how decentralized it really is.

A valid block is one that passes consensus rules. We have chain splits that happen numerous times a day, every day in the form of orphaned blocks.

4) A paper wallet simply has the keys in plain sight
5) The hardware wallet I have supports pins from 1-24 digits long. 
Hardware wallets simply store keys, in an offline manner, and sign transactions with them. They all have security features that keep access at bay just like your phone does, and you can lock it up in a safe at all times without worrying about losing it. If it gets stolen or damaged, you would likely know because your entire safe would be stolen/damaged as well and you can use your recovery seeds to load the keys elsewhere, and move the coins to another address with a new key, before the attacker could get through the hardware wallet local security features.

@_date: 2017-06-23 10:59:55
This is a more complicated question than you probably intended for it to be...
The absolute answer is they are 100% traceable. If you look into how a bitcoin transaction works, you can send bitcoin only by literally pointing to a previous transaction in the chain that sent them to you. And by logic, that transaction points to the previous transaction all of the way back until the coinbase transaction that it was originally created in. You can do this simply by looking up your transaction in a blockchain explorer. 
The complexity of your question comes in the *how* traceable are they from a *practicality* standpoint. After clicking around on a explorer for a while you will realize how overwhelming it is. It isn't something really feasible manually without some serious concentration and even then only a few layers back. However with computer code, it is quite easy to find the trace-route of a bitcoin.
To make things even more difficult, addresses are created at random and many wallets generate new addresses for every transaction so you ramp up that complexity factor very quickly. 
To answer your full question as directly as I can, with enough dedicated effort it would be possible for anyone to trace your money. It would also require proving that you have the private keys for the addresses that the coins entered though, and that's really the most difficult part. The would need to prove a "sphere of ownership" with moments of when it entered your control and when it left. Again, not impossible but not practical for something not worth it for the tracking party. 
But there are people sitting in jail right now due to the traceability of bitcoin. Rest assured it is 100% possible.

1) you've invested too much then. This is still magic internet money at this point. 
2) The transaction should either go through or drop from the mempool within a few days. Many miners drop txs after 72 hours. Like I stated above, your inputs are not in a valid transaction yet, so technically they are still unspent. They may be stuck in limbo, but they aren't gone forever. I know it is stressful, but just wait it out. 
3) If you absolutely cannot wait, and don't want to go through the hairy exercise of doublespending with a higher fee, there are paid options. I've used [this]( before. Basically you pay an additional fee via visa, and it flags multiple mining pools to absolutely include your tx in their next block. You'll end up spending a few more dollars on the tx, but if you have a couple thousand waiting in limbo, it may be worth it. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:04:47
You never need the chain until you need the chain.

No, this entire "false dichotomy" started when someone who was a terrible student and clearly never paid any attention in basic economics class, became a serious contender in the US presidential election. 
Socialism is clearly defined as the social ownership of the factors of production. Just like addition and subtraction have definitions, and things build upon them, so does socialism. You can't just go change that at will.
What happened, was Bernie, who knows very little about economics confused Social Democracy with Democratic Socialism, and they are patently different things in the world of actual economic sciences. The "Nordic Countries" he pointed to came out and even said [they aren't socialist]( Bernie, refused to admit he was wrong (I mean at that point you just have to pretend you know what you are talking about or tank your candidacy), and the left went right along with redefining terms that have been defined for centuries now to fit the narrative. 
A capitalist structure, with sound democratic social expenditures is by definition ***not*** socialism. ***Every single case where socialism has been tried in recorded history, it has failed within 2 decades***, or turned into a fascist regime. 
I sympathize with the issues Bernie brings up. He has his eyes on the right symptoms. But what he proposes (socialism) is going to do nothing but make it worse. And if we play the semantics game of "well it's not normal socialism" then I'm sorry, but I refuse to trust our economy in the hands of someone who doesn't understand such a fundamental economic construct as the definition of socialism. You can't just change the definition at will without reconstructing all of economic study as we know it.

If you know anything about Ethereum, you would know that it is substantially different than bitcoin. Sure they have faster/cheaper transactions, but you don't think that was a trade off for something else?
Pump the breaks. Realize bitcoin is the best at what it does, Ethereum is the best at what it does, and that they aren't competing directly. ETH pumpers probably want you to think they are, but if you do your own research, you'd know they aren't. 
Why on earth do you think bitcoin has any value if that value can be shaken as easily as some competition? It can't, because bitcoin is more than just about transaction fees and speeds.

Bitcoin fees are based on transaction size in bytes, and have absolutely nothing to do with value.

@_date: 2017-06-01 02:46:14
That's not how it works. The size of the block makes no difference in how fast it takes to mine it. The block does need to be propagated to all nodes on the network: downloaded to each node, stored into RAM, validated individually by each node, and then re uploaded, all within a reasonable time so that miners aren't working on blocks longer than they should be and everyone stays in sync. This is exponentially harder with larger blocks. Studies have shown that typical nodes begin to struggle at 4MB, which is a 2MB HF with Segwit, and even 1MB with Segwit can get as large as 4MB. 
Visa level transactions alone would have a minimum block size of 250MB, and more likely 1GB. This is substantially larger than the 4MB most nodes can handle. If you aren't running a node, you are depending on someone else for control of your money which runs 100% contrary to the purpose of bitcoin. 
Fees will never go away even with unlimited block size. Transactions will always take 10-30 minutes (longer with larger blocks meaning more orphaning). This is the reality of a distributed ledger system. 
Saying "let's just raise the block size" is the equivalent of telling a debt burdened country to "just raise more debt". There's unintended consequences that accompany such a decision. That's just reality.

If I recall there are some diagrams in that book. It truly is comprehensive, and he does a very good job explaining the entire protocol from the basics. He even goes into private key signing and the math behind how it, and elliptical functions work. It isn't a beginner level book by any means though. Not too difficult if you understand programming though. 
He does have some code samples on signing transactions using various code libraries. I have not made it all of the way through the book yet, so I don't know if there are actual code samples as to the physical signing. But from what I remember, some of those libraries are open source so you should be able to steal some ideas from them.

BU as a group has not officially come out and said it, but multiple of their members have alluded to it. And it makes sense in their idea of what bitcoin is. 
If blocks are unlimited size, then there is no market for space on the blockchain. The reason bitcoin transactions used to be free was because by the way that fees work, they are optional. You can create a valid transaction with 0 fee. Unfortunately, you aren't going to be picked up in a block if every other transaction has a fee included and space is limited. In fact, miners have "minimum fee" settings in their software to make sure they are making money.
With unlimited blocks, you either have very, very low or no fees. How else do the miners get compensated? Block reward. But if the block reward decreases every 4 years, we are either going to have to raise fees, or raise the coin limit. 
Bitcoin on chain won't ever compete with cash. It's a reality we all need to face. You simply can't compete with 100% untraceable, free and instant transactions with something that was built to have 30 minute transactions, be 100% traceable, and needs a fee in order to run. Bitcoin makes an incredible asset, but a terrible cash. 
Remember when people ask "what is bitcoin backed by", that the cash like transactions that people will make off chain with actual bitcoin, is backed by the most secure value transfer protocol, and fixed asset on the planet.

Where the market decides it is not longer worth having of course!
The market is demanding it right now because it is a fixed limit, and is too damn decentralized for anyone to change that. Very few people are "buying coffee with it". If you bought a 100% gold coin for $10, and you could sell it for $1000, would you go buy a $5 cup of coffee with it?
If fees are $100, to me, having a decentralized, fixed limit store of value, than can still be transferred, is more important than being able to buy "coffee". You will never, ever, ever convince me otherwise. If you want a centralized blockchain to be edgy and buy "coffee" with, then please do fork off and do so. Because I will never point my node to a chain that it can't run. And there's quite a few others who believe the same thing.

When you buy and sell from coinbase, you are simply using coinbase as a "retailer" for the coins. You pay them fiat, and they "reserve" a certain amount of their overall stash for you. Only when you ask for them to send them to a wallet external of coinbase are they actually not in coinbase's control. 
If you send a tx on the bitcoin network, then you will have a fee. If your transaction does not have a fee, then it is not an onchain transaction and you are not actually sending bitcoin on the bitcoin protocol. You are sending a representation of bitcoin in someone else's control.

Capitalism would let the banks that gambled lose. And all the customers who trusted those banks would lose as well. And the next go around, people would be more careful with their money. But the socialists in the world can't stand the idea of the common man losing their money for their own bad choices, and so we end up with a bailout.

Well to start with we can look at the current governance. The Ethereum development crew makes executive decisions. That's a fact. As proven by the existence of Ethereum Classic. 
And a switch to POS will entail those who have the most coins, getting the mining fees, which further centralizes. Soon enough there will be pools, and it becomes no different than bitcoin mining centralization. So now you have governance and mining centralization. 
Bitcoin on the other hand, is so decentralized that we have been stuck in a dead stalemate for over a year now. Not a bad thing if you ask my opinion.

1) Fees are based on the size of transaction, not the amount of money. It would have been the exact same fee if the input you were spending was 1000000BTC or .002BTC. Amount makes no difference.
2) Bitcoin on chain will always be more expensive than visa. In order for bitcoin to continue working, on chain transactions must have a fee. The block reward is already low, and it is only going to get lower. Miners need to be compensated somehow. Off chain transactions are the only thing that can help bitcoin compete with bitcoin. Until then, bitcoin makes for a terrible currency and a really good gold.

The problem is, it is a dichotomy. Many businesses aren't supporting UASF because Core won't release "official" code for it (they wouldn't trust their business to amateur code), but Core won't include it in a release because businesses don't support it. 
Core has held off long enough. It is quite clear that this is User activated, nor developer activated, which was their original concern. But as neutral developers, they have a responsibility to provide the users with code that allows for users to voice their support. At this point, Core is actively blocking UASF as well. There really is no other reason to not allow for a configuration option that is disabled by default. The only way it gets enabled is if the User makes the conscious choice to activate it.

1) You are wrong about greed. I trust the nobel prize winning [Milton Friedman's take on greed]( over some hippy on reddit's take any day. The entire economic balance of bitcoin depends on greed. 
2) Bitcoin was never ever about eliminating fees. You can tell that because of the structure of the block reward diminishment. Bitcoin cannot survive *without* fees. There will *always be fees* from here on out. If you want to get rid of fees, how else do you plan to compensate the miners for their securing of your transaction. 
Bitcoin is entirely about a fixed amount asset, and it is decentralized to ensure that never changes. Anyone is free to create more bitcoins than the consensus rules allow, but understand that there will be a large portion of the economic population of bitcoin that won't follow you. 
Bitcoin is about avoiding the practices of a central bank. Giving people a competitive option instead of being coerced to either save money in currency that erodes away every day by funding the wars with more debt, and leaving that debt in the hands of the taxpayers to pay back with interest that needs more debt to be able to pay back. There is no other alternative. Other than gold or other commodities that are highly manipulated, and easy to steal.
Bitcoin was never about eliminating fees. It's impossible for bitcoin to run *without fees*. It is decentralized, because the idea of a fixed limit asset that is hard to manipulate is dangerous for the current power status quo. It has nothing to do with getting rid of greed. Greed never goes away. Learn to embrace greed when it is appropriate.

By the time LN is perfected, we will have 5G, and the median level of computer hardware will be sufficient enough to process larger blocks. We may even see bitcoin protocol validating ICs implemented into hardware with the specific purpose of quickly validating blocks. But the point being is that if it comes to centralization of nodes or higher fees on the main chain (up to and including $50-100) I will choose higher fees all day long because I know that eventually computer hardware will catch up and lower those costs. It is very hard to reverse node centralization once you turn it into an arms race like mining has become.

Visa does about 1971 tx per second. So if worldwide adoption of all money transactions are your goal, much, much, higher than that. Which is why arguing about the block size is pointless, because the block size does nothing in terms of overall scaling, but does tend toward centralization. 2MB blocks without Segwit makes for about 5 tx per second. With Segwit, around 10. 
Off chain scaling will need to happen. Otherwise we may as well use visa because it's the same level of centralization without fees and the enormous energy usage.

No, I can transact with someone that I have an open channel with for free. That person can then transact that same amount to someone else who they have an open channel work for free. So the person I have an open channel with acts as a hub, and can charge a penny for such a fee. This isn't centralized because there is no counter party risk, anyone can offer to be a hub, and you can still transact on chain if you wish. If I open a channel with Google per say, for around $2000 every month, I can knock out all of my daily transaction needs, instantly, probably free because Google will sell the meta data for marketing, and every month I pay (or google may if that's part of their profit model) one opening and one closing transaction fee. 


Good luck finding who I send money to if Google is the LN hub that I use. 


Are you kidding? Fees are barely more than a wire right now. The only transactions that would be made on chain are large amounts. And that's with full blocks. With micro transactions off the chain, space will fee up significantly. 
And once again, no, I can start up a LN node. In fact I plan to. 
Like it or not, you can't have decentralized nodes and large blocks. It's impossible. End of fucking story. Visa level transactions *alone* are a minimum of 250MB blocks, likely many times that because multisig transactions scale quadratically. Will LN fix it all? No. But it doesn't make things worse, something that big blocks most definitely will. 
Corporate interests would *love* to control the nodes. 10 years time, blocks are so big that you need an enterprise server to run:
"I think we should lift the maximum coin cap."  Miners wouldn't oppose, that's more block reward for them. Nodes certainly wouldn't because it puts us right back into the inflationary system we currently have, and by then banks are in control. 
What is your ideal scenario with large blocks? Seriously, enlighten me.

It would offer some heat that could be used, sure, but it cannot compete with something like a resistive heater that dedicates *all* of the energy to heat. And resistive heaters are fairly primitive heating mechanisms anyways. For the amount of heat to feel comfortable with, when ambient temperatures are around freezing, you are much more likely to get more bang for your buck through something like a heat pump (basically the hot side of a refrigerator) than a resistive heater. 
But the bottom line is that in order for "heat" to be "useful" it needs to be relatively concentrated, low entropy source.
A much more effective long term solution for the bitcoin energy usage would be to harness solar/nuclear energy.
Edit: Another thing to realize is that heat transfer is largely dependent on there being a temperature difference. As that difference depletes, less and less heat transfers over. The surrounding air can only get as hot as the chip, and as the chips get hotter and hotter, they perform less and less optimally/efficiently. At a certain point it becomes costly for the miner because the energy consumption is more than he is willing to pay for to profit.

If you are holding coins on an exchange you do not actually have any bitcoin. It is no different than a bank at that point. The exchange has you in their own internal database as having X amount of coins that you can pull out at any time, but there is not an address with a key designated to you.

Yes I can. If I'm the only one with my rules, I have, by definition consensus.

Just because that does not have 100% of the economic population on consensus, doesn't mean that I can't choose what consensus I have with others. If the value of bitcoin has to split because the population on each chain has to split, I'm ok with that.

Most of bitcoin's detractors don't even spend the time to get involved enough to even see that bitcoin has any merit. They assume that digital money is an oxymoron and dismiss it immediately. 
I have yet to find anyone who actually understands the mechanics of bitcoin, think that it has 0 value. There are plenty of people who may not see it as world changing, but pretty much anyone who takes the time to learn the basics of bitcoin and the technology believes that it has a fairly bright future.

Any transfer of value system needs to have a solid asset of that backs it, or an understood value to remain stable. Bitcoin is nowhere near its market price if it can be what we expect it to be, so yes, bitcoin at the moment is 100% digital gold and hodling. 
Very few people are buying and spending bitcoin regularly. Money is pouring into bitcoin because of the fixed amount, and the rapid rise to market price. Even without high tx fees, bitcoin makes for a terrible alternative to cash at the moment. It makes for an excellent alternative to gold however.  
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:20:21
Possibly, but very unlikely. This is people's stored value they are talking about. Not something like a myspace page where it's as easy as changing to facebook. Even Ethereum people seem to think as a "competitor" but if you actually know anything about the platforms you know that they are completely different things that serve different purposes, and have pros and cons. Where Ethereum exceeds, it gave up other things that bitcoin has that will bite it in its ass. The future world is one with many atomic transactions where people chose money that fits their needs, and can convert instantly to whatever whoever they are paying wants. 
Also, not only does bitcoin get the first mover/founder award, it is open source, and the ledger is really what makes bitcoin bitcoin. It is more like comparing "internet" to TCP/IP. Sure TCP/IP is the fundamental protocol for the "internet" but that doesn't mean that the "internet" won't ever receive upgrades in the future. By being open source, bitcoin sets the bar that all other projects be open source. So if another project shows to be better than bitcoin, we simply adopt their code and continue on with the ledger. 
There's a reason countries are focused on "Bitcoin et all" and not "Ethereum et all" or "Litecoin et all".

No they can be stolen. 
Bitcoin is a ledger system. You send bitcoin by pointing at a previous transaction to an address, and then signing the new transaction with the private key that is unique to that address. That's the only thing that can send bitcoin. That's why when people lose their wallet passwords, they lose their bitcoin, because it is mathematically impossible to get those bitcoin back. 
When your coins are with coinbase, they just tell you that you have a certain amount. They have you in their own internal database. If you send bitcoin within their ecosystem (to another coinbase user) they just update their own database to reflect that. You aren't sending bitcoin at that point. That's why it has no fee and is instant. 
If you want to move your coins from coinbase, on your cashout transaction, the input will probably be a very large amount (50 BTC+) and a small portion of that will be paid to the address you gave. You never had that 50 BTC. Coinbase did. And ***they*** are the ones signing the transaction, because until it leaves, it is ***their*** bitcoin. 
The only time you ever actually own bitcoin is if you are storing it on an actual wallet software with your own private keys. If the software didn't have you confirm a seed (12-24 random words) or give you a private key, and you can't view your private keys, ***then the bitcoin isn't yours. It belongs to whoever is holding it on your behalf. Exchanges have, do, and will go down unexpectedly.***

Also, you do realize blocks that can handle current Visa level transactions are &gt;250MB in the ***theoretical minimum***, don't you?

But if it is behind a firewalled router without this exploit, and all the other machines on the LAN are safe, then there really is no worry.

I never said that it was purely hub and spoke. But if you think that with the economic incentives to run a node, there won't be competition, and quasi centralization of hubs you are fooling yourself.

Just because you're cucked by the system doesn't mean the system is absolute. It is only as absolute as long as those are in power. The Nazis had some pretty strict rules too. Would you conform to Nazi standards?
You seem to be misunderstanding the situation. No one is at all surprised at the situation. In fact, we all expected it. But that still doesn't change the fact that from an absolute justice standpoint he did nothing wrong, and the rules were not only arbitrarily applied like always, they were especially enforced for this particular case because it was a "fuck you" to the system.

If you leave the transaction, it should die off in about a week or so. If not, or you want it to move sooner, you need to resend the inputs used, with a higher fee. The higher fee one will go through and the lower fee one will bounce because the coins are already spent.

No we aren't. Bitfury did a fully analytical report which showed that 4MB is the limit for most nodes currently on the network. Segwit with 1MB blocks can get as big as 4MB.

Bitcoin transactions are made up inputs and outputs (that are later used as inputs to new transactions). Inputs are either "spent" or "unspent", depending on if they are in a transaction that is in a valid block. 
So if you use the same inputs, in a new transaction with a higher fee, the higher fee tx will be picked up. At that point, if the lower fee to is ever attempted, the miner would see the inputs are already spent and it would "bounce". It isn't possible to accidentally double spend bitcoin.

There is a reason the block size is small and the block time is 10 minutes. Bitcoin is a "distributed ledger",  and every 10 minutes that ledger is updated. As you decrease the size of that block time, you increase the required resources to distribute that ledger in a timely manner. 
If two miners find different blocks, once those blocks are distributed to other nodes and miners, those nodes and miners use the first valid block that they receive. However, because the chain temporarily splits, one block will have more hash power than the other and will solve their block faster than the other. Those miners then forward their blocks. Because the block does not work for the miners on the other side of the split, but the entire blockchain works, the node chooses the chain with the most pow. The block they had previously received is then "reorganized" into the chain, and if transactions that were in the previous block aren't in the new chain they disappear. That is why you need to wait for 3 confirmations at least for transactions to work. We get about 1-4 orphaned blocks a day as is. Decreasing block times simply increases that and would need more confirmations to default. It solves nothing. 
Increasing block sizes also plays a roll in this. As block sizes increase, nodes still need to download, store into RAM, ***validate***, and then reupload these blocks to all other nodes before that process can be repeated across the entire network. This has to happen as soon as possible so that miners aren't working on worthless blocks. 
Litecoin will face worse scaling issues when/if their blocks ever fill up. 
The scaling solution for bitcoin *needs* to come in the form of reducing the number of on chain transactions if we wish for it to remain decentralized. The number of nodes on the network exasperate this problem, but the more honest nodes on the network, the safer it is.

Bitcoin is the very antithesis of socialism. It is the individual ownership of property that no one else can tell you what to do with. 
As such, you can't tell anyone that they can't hold x amount of bitcoin. Anyone can hold however much they want. 
Get out of here with your redistribution of wealth bullshit. Bitcoin is where it is today because of strong capitalist, free market, libertarian principals. We don't need people who know little about economics coming in, demanding redistribution, and turning it into the system we have today around the world where the government inflates from those who save, and steal the interest for themselves, while keeping the poor in a welfare status. 
Learn to accept free markets as a good thing, and good things will come to you.

You clearly have 0 idea what you are talking about. BIP148 is a soft fork. The blocks are readable by legacy nodes. Literally, the fucking definition of a soft fork. 
The definition of a hard fork is that old nodes are no longer compatible. 
When 148 eats the legacy chain after a reorg, you will 100% see why it is a soft fork and not a hard fork. 
Sorry buddy. Go do some research. You're clearly out of your league talking about this. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:02:35
If it won't succeed then why is it dangerous? How is it any more dangerous than a hard fork if it is not going to succeed?

A fixed limit asset that is so decentralized people can't even decide how to scale it because there's so much interest in such a secure store of value. One that you can send $10M worth for $5.

If I were in charge of running an investigation that involved tracking bitcoin, having no investigation experience, this is what I would do:
I would identify the sources of the crime, and gather as many bitcoin transactions related to that source as possible (or however I decided bitcoin was involved, I would start with this bitcoins. 
I would then, trace all transactions to that address, from their conception, to their current status, and have the trace-route with all of the addresses each has used. I would then try and find which coins went through the same addresses, and any "hot" addresses that are used regularly, I would try to link an identification to that. Theoretically everyone has an "entry" point at least, and an exit point. If I can track enough coins back to an "entry point" per se, and then have them produce KYC info on those entries, I would then trace as many forward as possible until I found a possible exit point. 
Now you could easily claim that you simply spent those coins, but now that I have them "tagged" I can simply watch them, and wait for them to go to an exit point. Also, if they haven't moved in a while I can assume they are either in hiding by you, or the person you say you "exited" with is still holding them, and it should be able to find that person and work my way back.
Like I said, it is doable. But it gets very complicated very quickly, I would bet exponentially with the number of addresses introduced. But if you can find patterns in addresses, you are on the right track. And because split coins offer little help, at some point you can expect linked coins to be combined back into a larger transaction and you can assume they never left control. 
Doable, yes. Complicated for sure.

Money easily gotten is easily lost. The principals behind bitcoin give it its value. And it's impossible to kill those principals now. Pandoras box is open.
Sure the shitcoin hijacked version may take off temporarily and become extremely valuable, until those principals are breached and people get fucked. They will always resort back to the one that is the best option. I'm not worried. Stupid people, please give me your ill gotten money.

The "credit cycle" is driven directly by the monetary policy, which ultimately drives the "business cycle". It's a game of musical chairs. Value is created by people doing productive things. Value overall increases, there's no reason for it to decrease unless that value never really existed in the first place (hello "loose" money). It's a fucking Ponzi scheme. 
And that entirely depends on your definition of banking. If your definition of banking is fractional reserve lending, no, that is fraud. See the above paragraph as to why fractional reserve lending only helps those at the top.

You call Segwit marginal but believe that 2MB is *reasonable*?
Visa level tx volume would require a *minimum* of 250MB blocks assuming a perfect scenario. 2MB is less than 1% of that. I believe that is the definition of "marginal".

That's not the point. The point is that we are all in 100% control of our own coins. The economic value that comes from that is the cooperation of other people agreeing on the utility of your coins. 
I'm sorry, but you will never convince me that miner centralized, and soon to be node centralized electronic coins, that take 30 minutes to completely confirm, and will always cost a fee, and are 100% traceable, are superior to a coin that has the ability to transact instantly for a penny, is shrouded from tracing, and anyone can run a node. I'm not the only one who thinks that either.
So you take your coins and go play in that sandbox over there, but we are moving on, we are done trying to play nice with you.

Bitcoin is exactly the system that departs from debt based money, and thus interest. 
You will find with bitcoin, even after it reaches market value, that your savings will increase much faster than they ever could with an interest savings account because they are a direct representation of value, not an abstract version of it.

Yes they are compatible. A non BIP148 node can accept a BIP148 block. That is the definition of a soft fork.

When network speeds across the world raise substantially to show that they can support larger blocks, we scale to larger blocks. 
I had a cell phone in the 90s. It was fucking huge, never had signal, and could only call. Now I am typing this response on my multitouch smartphone, connected to an LTE network that I have to try to not get signal for if I wanted that. 
Hardware technology will need to keep up with software. But if you give up the potential of a decentralized money so that you can get a transaction through for a low fee, I'm surprised you found bitcoin because you truly would be dull.

I agree. Crash is impending, I'm slowly selling off for profit and plan to buy back substantially at the bottom. It's a long term play, but the impending crash is a money making opportunity. It's just too hard to guesstimate how high it will go or when it will go in order to short. But when the primary focus of the userbase is simply overtaking bitcoin's market cap, which I have no doubt it will do, it will crumble shortly after that goal is met and the late comers who have no idea what they are buying and have the most to lose will get burned badly by those who have been in since December at $8 per coin.
