Actually no. It is a search system to find pizza or restaurant or exchange, etc :) 
You will not find drugs or weapons or anyrhing like that, as we will moderate businesses. 
By the way you will have ability to report business if you will find something prohibished.
@_date: 2018-09-29 21:50:46
You should add this business to our database on BitcoinWide.com
@_date: 2018-09-29 22:25:37
Hold. If you have. 
If you don't - toss a coin )

Great question.
You are absolutely right, most of users will use it on smartphones/mobile, and we do keep it in mind during development. 
At this point, mobile users can access system directly from the website, which is optimized for mobile devices and show most relevant search results considering user's location. 
It mean that if your current location is New York and you are searching for "pizza", you will get nearest pizza restaurants or delivery services located in New York at the top of the search results.
Of course, you will have to allow you browser to share your location.
Some of future releases will include iOS and Android apps, which will open much more great tools and abiliities for users.

That is why I do not compare Dash and Monero. It is different currencies with different advantages and disadvantages.
@_date: 2019-08-21 07:16:35

Bitcoin has even less privacy. Why use it? ))

Thanks for letting us know what is important for users. 
As you have mentioned, you will not gonna fly somewhere to buy pizza, and it important remark, because it is reflect what is the most imortant for users. 
It's all about relevance algoritm and recognition of what exactly user is looking for. Realizing that, we are working now to deliver search results in a manner, when you get what you need and where you need. 
For example, when you search for "pizza", it is clear that you want it as close to you as possible. But when your friend from Paris asking you to order some pizza for him for BTC, you will search for "pizza Paris", and you will need pizza in Paris. 
If is just great when our vision of paramount tasks is match up with users.
Was happy to find your comment ;)
By the way, you can also search in the map mode (can be found in the top right menu), where objects nearest to your location will appear in the first instance.
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:22:21
Yes, it is. Does it mean that Dash has no? ))
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:26:08
It is x1800 faster.
@_date: 2019-02-22 00:20:27
+1 in the place :) Please do not forget to add this location to our database, so nobody miss it after we will launch: 
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:00:52
I can't agree that Bitcoin does not work for retail itself. There is a many businesses accepting it already and more joining each day. Another aspect that LN is helps to solve some mentioned issues.
At [ we will probably split Bitcoin and Bitcoin LN as a payment methods accepted by businesses in the database. It may be a useful improvements for the users.

In some of the nearest release you will find this feature, allowing you to show merchants around you in one click.
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:44:48
Good suggestion! Thanks.
I will add it to the list for discussions.
@_date: 2019-12-23 06:05:08
Thanks for the answer. If you will want to spend some a few minutes to find out presence of some mentioned businesses on BitcoinWide ([ I will appreciate it. 
In case of absence, adding them to the database will be really helpful.
@_date: 2019-12-21 22:05:11
Thanks for a review. 
Business near you - expect soon, in the next release probably.
Back button issue is already resolved, but not pushed to the server yet. Anyway, thanks for this bug report!

Good question. Added to backlog.
@_date: 2019-12-23 06:07:59
Any businesses in your area accepting Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency directly?
@_date: 2019-12-21 11:29:17

@_date: 2019-12-23 16:09:22
Thanks. I was happy to find the link provided. We will work to research and add the businesses listed there to out database at [
Do you meets places working with LN on your way every day or it is just occasionally?
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:46:15
I'm not sure what is your question about. 
Do you mean if we will show LN and on-chain payments as a different payment method?
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:57:16
Excellent decision! ;) 
Add to the database, so people know about you once we will run the platform: 
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:05:11
You will be able to find and add places and all other kind of businesses very soon, once we will make a public release (in a few days): 
Meanwhile, there is a form to add places if you know any.
Cheers ;)
