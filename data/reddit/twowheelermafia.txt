Thank You for replying
From what I found on the web will now, This problem is analogous to making a Web Scraper and apparently, Blocks don't have a file format. They are just blobs of binary data which we will need to understand how to parse. Please correct me if I was wrong!

The population of this country is more than the population of South America + North America + Europe combined. If someone from France scammed you then you wouldnt put the blame on someone from argentina, Similarly just because some idiot from Bihar tries to scam you that does not mean you put the blame on other 1.3 billion people. dumbass.

Most banks in India give loans to corporates who are favourites of our politicians. Then these corporates flee the country and settle in some other country and that laon becomes a NPA which is recovered form the taxes which we pay.
