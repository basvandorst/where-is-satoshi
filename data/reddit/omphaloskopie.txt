not really though... it's more like you bought something of an artist that formerly was worth fivefold his temporary value and then your "speculation" panned out. your comparison makes you sound as if you created yet another altcoin and succeeded with it. which would be way more impressive. so is the success of any artist in a marketplace full of self-proclaimed artists. 
not to point out any flaw in your investment-strategy. there are way more ways  to be wrong than right. you are allowed to be proud of it, just don't overdo it.
better than me anyways... bought at \~3600 and sold at 4k this year. shiiiiiieet. now fomoing but nervous bc i sold at \~14k after last moon-spike. feels bad to get into it at nearly the same price now. there is a part of me that really wants to though. dunno if i am sitting this one out.

where do you even make these steel seeds? isn't that a risk in its own? the seed itself may be safe, but could a malicious manufacturer just try it on every wallet of the blockchain? its only 42 million wallets total.

the first part is enough for me. i was mistaken by thinking a steel seed was a sheet of steel with the seed pressed into / printed onto it. by some company that "only" gets to know the seed, not the wallet. but now i realize that that security flaw is far too obvious.

why would you colorcode right red and wrong green?

640K Bytecoin ought to be enough for anyone!

i am guessing the bot looks only for  and then some + retweets/favs when it decides what is relevant.
