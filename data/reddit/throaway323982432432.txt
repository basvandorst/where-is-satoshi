I'm not angry, actually.
Anarchists have been around for a while. You may be interested to find out that there are different kinds of anarchists, specifically the left anarchists and then anarcho-capitalist. I've never seen or heard of a violent anarcho-capitalist.
The fact that we don't have yet a place where anarchy and free markets thrive is not because it's a bad idea. Just like the abolition of slavery wasn't a bad idea, yet somehow it took time and understanding to do it.
If you personally don't feel that you are being enslaved by your government, it doesn't mean I don't feel it. You response is "deal with it, that's how our society works".
I don't want to convince you. I know that's probably not going to happen. I also don't want to fight you. But the world is changing and for people like you who believe that government is a good idea and anarchy is bad, time has passed. You are the past now.

And then you don't understand how government works. No matter how much money they owe in Bitcoin, they will lose power! The monopoly on violence and taxation can no longer be sustained when you have to pay for it out your own pocket and not out of the pockeckets you tax and enslave. It is prohibitively expensive to tax Bitcoin.

I do. By threat of imprisonment, brainwashing and audit to detect tax evaders. If people discover it's much easier to avoid detection with Bitcoin, they are going to do it more, not less. Thus, government is going to have less and less tax revenue each year, because less and less money can be spent on detecting tax evaders.

They will run out of bitcoins, sure. Problem is, the bitcoins they have can postpone adoption for quite a long time. They probably hope for a complete loss of interest for it forever.
