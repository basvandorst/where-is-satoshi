Well I guess I should at least request it from shopify, the more people ask then eventually they will respond. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:45:24
Any idea if btc pay integrates with shopify? 
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:43:40
Ok, I'll take a look and see what I can add. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:42:47
Quite a few actually, and Eth, ltc. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:41:58
Thanks!

Let me see if my developers can fix the mobile issue. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:35:19
in essence, isn't that what telemarketers and spammers are doing with fiat? There is a cost associated with every call they make, but the spamming company collects the money(the one that facilitates the calls). With BTC or any cryptocurrency, this would at least put the money in the people's hands instead, shifting control to the consumer instead of the corporation. Not sure that it would end spam calls, it would just shift who would benefit financially.

Not sure how to post something and update everyone. I have been getting some emails from customers that they never received a confirmation email for their order. I'm not sure why some customers are receiving them and others are not. I will be checking with my web developers on Monday. If you placed an order, we are prepping them for shipping Monday. If you don't receive a tracking number email by Monday please message me. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 02:45:47
I'll set them aside for you
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:46:07
Thanks!

I've been running into this problem. Facebook and Instagram keep suggesting me to boost my posts for my crypto liquor store, but when I try to run an ad, they reject it because of the relationship to cryptocurrency. I tried explaining that I'm just a liquor store (which can advertise on fb and ig), that accepts cryptocurrency payments.

Not yet, we have no integration solution into our pos. There are manual ways to do it, but for practical purposes it would annoy regular customers waiting in line while we created a manual crypto purchase. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:22:38
So the online orders are shipped or they can choose in store pickup. We use the coinbase commerce api, so there is a 15 minute window to complete the transaction before the order cancels. On these types of orders there is time for us to confirm the payment before shipping the goods. In the physical location it would take too long to create the payment request, And wait for the confirmation when there is a line of customers. We could do it if it was an order someone was planning on advance, but when it's our peak busy times, it would turn off a lot of regular customers.

Hopefully I can do international shipping in the future
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:14:55
We currently only accept it for online orders. There's no practical way to do it in our brick and mortar location yet. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 10:37:03
Can't ship to all, but easier to say than to the states we are currently allowed to ship to and also excluding Hawaii and Alaska. In our FAQ we list the states we currently cannot ship to.

We do have a pretty big craft beer selection. I could start adding them in. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:01:10
You got me. You figured out my plan to run a business and try to make profit. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:11:03
For our site we only take crypto, so 100% is crypto.
So far the break down is
@_date: 2018-06-03 20:51:27
some craft beers should upload on our next cycle tomorrow if I configure everything correctly

If you haven't tried oven baking your bourbon before you're missing out
LOL, somehow that's been up there on my regular site for a year and no ones said anything. First day on reddit on my new site and someone finds it immediately. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:07:46
I started accepting cryptocurrency for my online liquor store,  I've been really surprised by how many people who have responded to it. My web hosting company thought I was crazy. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:16:01
Good question, crypto values are pretty volatile. By law, I am not allowed to sell alcohol below my wholesale cost, so I have to list in USD, which is what I paid my invoices with. Also, our POS system does not have live cryptocurrency values built in and neither does our web hosting company.
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:20:38
Totally understand. If it helps, we are an actual brick and mortar store. We've been in business for over 17 years now, so we aren't new to liquor retail but definitely new to crypto. I started buying cryptocurrency in September of 2017, with btc being my first purchase.
Hopefully the site will run smoothly, however I am the first customer my web hosting company has integrated with coinbase commerce. They host a lot of traditional liquor store sites, which is their focus, but this is the first time they added the coinbase api. We've run several test purchases and everything seems to be working fine. The only thing I don't like is that I have to use the Jaxx wallet to be able to issue refunds, and so far it seems like Jaxx runs a little slow sometimes. Supposedly coinbase commerce will have their own solution soon. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:53:10
Maybe one day but since current alcohol laws make it illegal to sell below wholesale cost, it would be very difficult to make sure everything was priced correctly.

We rely on our carrier, FedEx, or UPS to verify age. We have to pay for a service called Adult signature, where the driver has to check the recipients ID for 21 or over. They are not allowed to leave the package at the door if no one is home. What's nice about btc and an online store is before with credit cards there was a high amount of fraudulent orders with stolen card info. With crypto, we don't have to worry about the funds being taken back. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:33:44
Because there is more demand than less demand
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:08:04
We do, online liquor store,  we've been running a free ground shipping promo until BTC hits 10K.
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:34:19
Ignorance is bliss
