Where do you have them stored?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:13:08
Long time since it was useful as a currency. Sadly.

Money on Internet would be very good to have when there is no more Internet, right?

Bitcoin is in a bubble for sure. But the bubble is not going to pop for many moons to come.

There are actually two: one in Euros and one in Swedish Crownes. They are quite popular in Sweden, with the correct setup through an Investment Account they become close to tax free for Swedes (you cant deduct losses thou)

You can however mine other altcoins that you then can exchange for (minimal amounts of) Bitcoins, but to mine BTC you need way better hardware than a couple of standard PCs

"Boring 25%..."
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:25:31

Sound stoooooopid
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:26:13
Is that after the fees 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:43:33
If you by "great" mean "obese", correct.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:24:07
No shill. My portfolio is BTC and ETH.

Lol checks, USA is still so backwards? 
@_date: 2019-06-15 20:43:44
I cash out 10% for every 100% gain. Still need 300% gain for next cashout thou. (Im in ETH but the principle still stands)
Then I have a personal moon - when/if my stash reaches 2.5M$, Im gonna cash out everything, pay 30% tax, and quit work.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:41:53
60% sounds cheap. Yes, im from Sweden, would love to pay only 60%...

Finally something Bitcoin, Bcash and Ethereum can agree on!
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:50:04
This proves that I am Satoshi
@_date: 2019-04-13 08:23:44
On the other hand, would they succed bruteforcing Satochis hildings, the BTC price would go to zero over the night.

Kleiman should put the email as evidence
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:14:36
Same or worse in Sweden, but 30% was on capital gains like crypto, 45-ish % on work/salaries.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:02:28
Are you or they within EU?
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:09:50
Sweden is 30% tax. Lucky you.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:23:33
Buy some more btc from a friend and transfer them...
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:27:41
Actually yes, it is worth more. Well not the actual coin, but the adress, since you should also have quite a few forked shitcoins there.

Pity, could have hit them with GDPR otherwise.
