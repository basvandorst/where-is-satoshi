That statistic is wrong for so many reasons.

By owning bitcoins, you're increasing its value. This is great for a government like North Korea which is amassing a bitcoin war chest. So whether you like it or not, you're helping a totalitarian dictatorship. I'm not saying that we should all stop using bitcoins because of this, but it's important to remain aware about these things.

You realize that by supporting bitcoin, you're essentially giving money to "a bunch of commies," right?

Of course. I don't have any USD and don't use any large banks, but it's pretty much impossible to not indirectly support evil entities. Buying a smartphone means you're indirectly supporting child slavery. Like I said, we can't do much to stop it but it's important to remain aware. We definitely shouldn't pretend like we're not giving money to totalitarians.
