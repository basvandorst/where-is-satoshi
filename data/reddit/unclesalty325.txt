Just seems cheaper and more likely.

You and me both.  But I bought LTC high and DGB on point.  So the only thing killing me is LTC.

The prediction for 5000.00 btc by the end of the year are looking more and more likely.  Maybe 6k now.  So 2k on you could go up to 3k on the high end.  That's this year.  It will then go down most likely after 6k, then rally back past and over.  Like the other guy said.  Every 8 or so months.

I was lucky to be friends of a friend who owns an post production company.  That is how I even heard about it.
Then we raised the movie to begin filming.  That was completed in about a 3 week time period in upper NY.
The story itself touched me.  It speaks to reality in today's healthcare problems.  It also touches on race relations as well as spirituality.  It was a very uniquely  written story I felt I could get behind!
The final project is a reality now with offerings on Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart and most streaming options.  
I could not have done what I did without my LTC profits.  Period.
Blessed is all I can say.  LTC is the future.  I beleive in it and Hold it large in my Crypto Portfolio.
Happy Holidays to all!

I could not have done this without it.

I have my money in Cryptos, BTC, BCH, LTC, and DGB.  People call me crazy.  But my kids and their kids will be calling me the one that had the balls.
Not all my money mind you.  Probably 40% of my retirement right now.  The rest is Pension and 401k.  3 ways.  All should work out, and if 1 or 2 fail the 3rd will make up for it.  The 3rd being Crypto.

Alts.  spread it around 5.  do it soon.  before the fork.

I think we have yet to reach bottom, but are close.
If you truely beleive in BTC, then you know this price is cheap.  You also know it can get cheaper before it pops bigger and better.  We just dont know.
Markets are rigged.
The key is get at least 1 BTC.
