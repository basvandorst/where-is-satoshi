if you ever do decide to stop hodling (which you shouldn’t any time soon) don’t cashout into fiat, go to jmbullion.com and use it to buy gold/silver/platinum/palladium

just keep hodlin, be patient

UPDATE i just checked and it was like 6500 now, if it keeps going lower, that is NOT the final crash, just a really great buying opportunity. Bitcoin is the future, people need to stop acting like this is the end, it's only the beginning
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:28:01
yes, it's a good strategy

We might be buying mcdonalds with bitcoin in a few years, but how many fucking zeros are gonna be after the decimal place when you get the order?
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:49:11
they should seriously update that, it worked fine when btc was under 1000 but now it's just insane
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:34:17
supply of bitcoin will never surpass 21m and demand keeps increasing, the ONLY way it could possibly die is if the government shuts it down

establishment media bashes wikileaks, what a surprise
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:13:57
only about 100 grand at this point, we all know many people who could afford that and some of you could yourselves
