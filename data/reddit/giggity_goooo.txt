I understand the tech and the purpose behind btc, but if I'm going to be completely honest, I just want to get RICH! I'm so done working for someone else.

Invest weekly, an amount that's comfortable.

I read something on this recently, if it's the same thing, and owning coins related to company stocks doesn't mean you own any of the company, like having real stock in it. I'm very leary of altcoins promising things and not delivering, deliberately or not.

This might be simplifying it too much, but I would bet big banks are the first to manipulate crypto because it's a competitor, they have money to burn, and the government will back them up.

If math like this is so hard, they probably shouldn't be holding much btc.

I hope that happens sooner than later! ��

Little bit weekly, bruh.

I bet holiday season kicks ass though. Lol

I'm impatient. I want to feel that high again like back when it was just under 20k, but the people that say it's better low so you can buy more are right. I'll just keep buying. I want to quit working my 8-5 so bad!

Similar situation here, and if I lose it, then what ever. You have to take big risks to get big returns.

My gut instinct says people won't FOMO until 10k+. We've seen near 20k late 2017. People are scared af right now to put in.  Side note, this stale market fucking sucks.

I see this is from 4 months ago. How are you feeling now? I'm pro crypto, btw.
