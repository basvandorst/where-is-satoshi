Yes that's an indication but technicaly you could have 2 differents nodes for the same rdns, one with the IPv4 and the other with the IPv6.

I don't understand your question..
The "constant" load is less than 100 Kbps as you can see on the network graph by day, the rest is seeding the block history to others and it can be more than 1 Mbps. 
NB : beside a weekly dump of the bitcoin.it wiki archives and some requests to my explorer (insight is installed on this node), this trafic is only caused by bitcoind.

Depends on the routeur (I don't know what you can do with yours) or the OS your are using (there are softwares to limit bandwidth usage).  
If you have to set a fixed limit: something &lt;= 90% of your upload speed (point is to not saturate your upload), If you can prioritize trafic by host / soft, just set bitcoin trafic priory to "low"

A node crisis? Look at my network [stats]( I don't think there is a need for more nodes besides people claiming to... Could you plese define "very few" and how many there must be for you to end this crisis?     
For me, there would be a node crisis when it would become difficult for anyone to run a full node (because of bandwidth, because of to much CPU/RAM needed etc..), which isn't the case today !

Nothing really hard about this setup, it's just a debian virual machine with enough disk space (currelty using 107 GB for the blockchain &amp; insight db).
For someone with knowledges about linux / admin sys, it's less than 1 hour of work! After all you have to do is to wait until sync is over / let the software running.
I updated Bitcoin Core to v0.10.1 yesterday for example, it took me less 5 mn.

You could run a node for the fun but if you need the blockchain data (for example for a bitcoin business or service) and don't want to reply on another third party (like blockchain.info or another explorer / API) you will have to run your own node.

Do we need more full node? In other words is this a problem?  
I run a node for more than 3 weeks [now]( and bandwidth usage is quite [low]( (1 Gbps available), so I assume we don't need mode full not at this moment (except for someone who will run his node to not depend on a onther node like a bitcoin service / poll / business etc.)

Maybe a node version problem ? Insight only works with Node v0.10.x (I had to downgrade and I'm now running v0.10.36).
If you have a compatible version of node all you need is to clone the git repository, "npm install" then "npm start" (after setting some environment vars, see [quick install](

The forum will pay up to 15 XAU (converted to BTC) for information about the attacker's real-world identity. Exact payment amounts will depend on the quality and usefulness of information as well as what information I've already acquired, but if for example you're the first person to contact me and your info allows me to successfully prosecute this person, then you will get the full 15 XAU. You need to actually convince me that your info is accurate -- just sending me someone's name is useless.

to simply start Bitcoin Core and let it sync itself
And you are wrong when saying that "don't have to validate years' worth of the entire world's transactions, and you can just start validating from a recent date", with ou without the bootstap.dat, bitcoin core will verify the blockchain!

That exactly what I did on my twitter link. the first tx sent appeared on my mycelium wallet but 10 mn later it disappeared to be replaced by the second one.  
The problem with your setup is that there is a chance I lose money, but for this ATM there isn't any risk for trying a double spend because if it's not working I'll get my money back (in this case: some cash). 
A more comparable setup would be :  
 
* I or someone I could trust setup a wallet / provide a address. (at the end I keep the monney)
* I try to double spend
* if not working : repeat 
* if working : I win / get 2 BTC
* if there isn't any double spend on the bitcoin core after 24h: you win / get 1 BTC.

Nope, my connection is/was ok, I can access other services / website but mycelium doesn't work...   
I'll try to update to the last version, maybe it's the server address change or a incompatibility with my old version! If it's that I would have like to have a "Please update" message instead of a "No server connection"

Is reddit the blockr.io support channel?  
If yes there is another bug:

You can check if your node is reachable (ie : accepting incomming connection) by typing your IP here -&gt;

It's the same problem in France : banks don't like bitcoin related businesses, but there is something in the french law called "Droit au compte" which people can use to get a bank account: they can go see the "Banque de France" and they will designate a bank who won't be abble to reject their application.  
Maybe there is something like that in the Netherlands law?

You don't get nothing in return when running a full node: you don't need to trust a third party to see/use the blockchain!
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:45:26
You just need to broadcast two (or more) txs with the same input(s), miners will decide (or they node/code implementation) at the end which tx they include in a bloc. 
  
example :   
I used bitcoin core console (createrawtransaction) and sent the first tx from blockchain.info website. The second one was sent from bitcoin core (broadcastrawtransaction) few second later.
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:42:10
So you are looking to create a bitcoin fork... but why?
If you want to go with "gavincoin", feel free to swith to bitcoin XT but don't mess with Bitcoin Core (even if you won't change anything by changing this setting alone in your node config)!
@_date: 2015-07-28 09:34:26


  
Where did you get this average time? If you are getting the timestamps in blocks that might not be accurate!

Why do you want to fork Bitcoin?

I would love to but no, sorry, I don't know the future/can't predict bitcoin price :)

This is a good question :-)  
And your math is right, that's why I'm againt any blocksize increase without any good reason..
@_date: 2015-09-09 10:54:42
I look at my node stats to see if all is ok: bandwidth usage, number of peers connected, CPU/RAM usage, how long since last block etc.. After that I'm sure "Bitcoin" is fine!

Sorry, but it doesn't make any sense.. Miners cannot decide or vote on the value of a bitcoin !

The people who care about centralization should run their own email server and their own bitcoin node..  
Fact is that with email servers you'll always be able to do it (buy your domain name and set up your own server), but for a bitcoin node with really big blocks it might (will ?) become too expensive for regular people / small businesses!

Nope, you'll have to wait (between 12h / 72h depending on your hardware and internet speed) or export your private key and use another bitcoin client.

The purpose of gitian: you are confusing a deterministic build process (what gitian does) and the source code of a project (for bitcoin core, it is hosted on github).  
You don't need gitian to fork and distribute verified sources, this is also true for binaries if you trust the guy who compile the source code for you.  
That's why I'm asking gavin to explain his tweet.

You know, it's a lot more helpfull for everyone if you try to not post when you don't know/understand a subject, there would be less noise and wouldn't make people who know stuff wasting their time to correct people's mistakes.

It should be available in 48h

Except that the isn't any link between commit access and gitian, I don't know if it's a good idea to rely on to verify a signiture!

Why not use an exchange? $25,000 isn't that much and you would be able to get your BTC in less than an hour on your wallet.
