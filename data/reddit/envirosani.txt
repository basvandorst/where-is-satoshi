They may be conservative in their programming but to suggest that their news are controlled by the government is just laughable.

How can it be like gold when it isn't a limited resource which secures it's value. Serious question, I don't know much about bitcoin.

Coming from the frontpage, but I just want to say that bitcoin will have to take off somewhere else before it will have an impact in germany. We like paying cash and don't even like to use credit cards. I don't think that buying bitcoin is something many germans would do. It's just a really abstract concept and a risky market. Both things germans don't like.

You talk about value while other people talk about fun. You seem to be a very serious person. Not everything needs to revolve around gaining money and having value. For some people the fun is enough. They just don't care for everything you think is valuable. The dogecoin community seems to be a bunch of people who support good causes with cryptocurrency because they can. No one over there is talking about taking over the world with their currency while you certainly think you found the new world currency with bitcoin. Well guess what, they helped a lot of people and while doing so exposed a lot of people to cryptocurrency, People who otherwise would never have heard of it. So in the end, they even help your cause. 
I don't know why you need to be so defensive when you have so much faith in bitcoin. When dogecoin is everything you said, they will be gone soon enough. Why bitch about people who have fun and help others?
