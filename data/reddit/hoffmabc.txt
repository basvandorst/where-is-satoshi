"...I suspect the main requirement those VC-funded industry members actually have is “convince our investors that Bitcoin can scale ASAP so they give us more money”, but that’s not an viable specification to work towards"
How about it's more like we're not going to spend millions of dollars building products on your toy network if you can't at least show some willingness to expand capacity on the network. I really find this outlook unappealing as if accepting venture money is some clear indicator that companies have ill intentions. 
Many of us want to see promising solutions come to fruition, have accepted VC money and want to see the best outcome possible for Bitcoin, but I really hate his attitude on this. Decentralization is the biggest benefit we see from Bitcoin and just because companies are predicting a need in quicker scalability does not diminish their opinion. 
Maybe rather than trying to lobby to the masses that you're right and they're wrong you can actually just work together better.

I am not trying to roil up support for Classic or some alternative I am pointing out that Peter Todd still wants to point to others and say they suck so listen to me, which is not conducive to work together.

@_date: 2016-04-06 19:43:50
One thing critics like to poke at with OpenBazaar is the notion that centralized services are more efficient and therefore something like OpenBazaar can never succeed. I will not refute that centralized services are more efficient, but what I will counter with is that the goal of OpenBazaar is not to entirely remove centralized services. Businesses are free to offer centralized services to fill gaps that decentralized networks like OpenBazaar don't do a good job of replacing. The important part is that incumbent marketplaces and businesses that have become complacent and monolithic are unbundled. This is vital to providing more competition and pushing the envelope for ecommerce on the Internet and giving users more control, more privacy, and more flexibility as trade becomes ever more global. The OpenBazaar of today will most likely look nothing like the one that it evolves into if it succeeds. And one reason why those past efforts failed is that their teams gave up and did not strive to improve or address user feedback and deficiencies. Lighthouse seems to have pretty much been presented, the mic dropped and then left to rot on the vine. Our vision is a world in which you choose what you want to sell, using a currency that is valuable anywhere in the world and if you choose to use centralized services for shipping, channel management, or insurance then you can but you are not forced to. Agree or disagree we are pushing towards that future and intend to keep doing so regardless of the haters.

No I think it's pretty clear he wanted to point out that these evil VC backed businesses have no interest in pure Bitcoin. If it wasn't for VC backed businesses half the core devs wouldn't be employed. My argument is he shouldn't designate VC with negativity. His new employer he touts received funding several times so are they evil?

I love this classic critique comment. We purposely integrated Blockchain ID for usernames because we wanted to support decentralized identity systems and so users can set that up. We could have written our own username system, but we decided to support the Bitcoin projects already working on that rather than reinvent the wheel. It's easier to make a joke though isn't it?

My point is that it's frustrating to people who aren't involved with the development. We go through this every time we do anything on this project.

This project has been more transparent than just about any other project on the Internet. You can go look at it and see what we're doing. No one has lied about anything. Your critiques are not great, they're misinformed and ignorant. I'm not calling you a meanie. I called you an asshole. We are not building a secret, drug selling hidden network. You can hold Amir to that vision not myself. I've been completely transparent about that for a long, long time. I'm very very sorry if you feel I or my team let you down on that. I don't really care one bit. I respond to you and Chris because I refuse to let you get a free pass for your trollish, bullshit behavior.

It's actually a shame about this regardless of where he's at. DarkWallet was one of the few projects that actually had the raw non-bullshit ethos that is so fascinating in the Bitcoin space. The milquetoast projects we continually churn out aren't progressing our industry but assimilating ourselves into more dick pic sharing and dating apps.

We are still working through a lot of these issues, but have some thoughts on this. At this time we're not incorporating anonymity by default but rather plan to support by providing a way to route your OB traffic through a SOCKS proxy like BitMessage does.
Kademlia traffic is a good question, but we are operating very similarly to the MaidSafe routing network and think that it can work. Our nodes do not need to see all messages such that would necessitate a flooding topology but we may have to do more research into this and adjust as necessary.
We are exploring options for how to prevent spam but are not ready to release that information yet.

People could choose to not tag their wares for the general public and then create TOR hidden services that provide IDs for the listings that can be reached directly. The network hosting listings is a convenience; you can think of the DHT as a cache for all of this while the nodes themselves are the authoritative data sources.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:18:06
Not to compare ourselves to giants, but if the inventors of the Internet hesitated because of the thought of how it might be used in the lowest depths of society then we might not be here talking right now. It will be the jobs of the same people who are responsible for policing content in the real world to deal with this. As I said before we don't even have the ability to police the listings if we wanted to. It's a peer to peer network like BitTorrent. Will it be used for negative purposes? I'm sure. Just like any other technology can be abused. We will serve as an agnostic technology that hopes to make a positive impact on the world, not facilitate deprived souls wishes.

Just like BitTorrent we may see sites standing up to serve as more flexible search options. You could have a site that focuses on Magic the Gathering card trading listings and you could submit your OB listing IDs  there with additional search metadata and provide that service. That's a pretty cool idea and that way we're not baking the centralized search into OB itself but layering it on top.

@_date: 2014-04-25 15:48:00
Ok well I think if the project is basically on hold then the repo should probably note that. I don't think I'm trying to imply that you all don't want anyone else to do anything with it, it's just that people are excited to move forward with it because it's a great idea and there wasn't really much clarity about what unsystem would do with it.
Not that we couldn't just fork it and leave it, we just didn't want to duplicate efforts if you were planning on building upon it.
Thanks for the clarification.
P.S. The name doesn't bother me so much (it's actually pretty cool sounding) it's just it already has a connotation with the credit card fraud forum so there's that.

First of all the design is not complete. How listings persist is not decided upon yet and there has been discussion about making this more resilient. I'm not buying completely into MaidSafe yet but it is very cool. Listings can be cached with expirations by other nodes and transactions be built offline. There are lots of ways to handle these challenges but they have to be explored. The project is a week old.

We are working on OpenBazaar now, which is a fork of the project. At some point you could produce any software you want to talk on the p2p network as long as you follow our protocol. You could even rename the software because it's essentially just a p2p client. Stop getting so hung up on the name.

Hey this is Brian from OpenBazaar. I just want to say wow and thanks for all the support. I am excited to see that what we're doing is inspiring so much thought in the space. 
If you have questions directly for the team please shoot them out and we can answer as many as possible. 
We will also be at the Bitcoin in the Beltway conference in Washington, D.C. this month and I will be speaking as well so don't miss it!

I normally wouldn't want to attempt to respond to an edited post, trying to stir up controversy, but I want to point out that the majority of our team resides in countries other than USA. If you want to spew untruthful information or attack our motives that's your prerogative, but wanted to inform others who might see this post. We are currently working to implement a multisig donation address that will be controlled by individuals all around the globe who assist me in running this project as well. If you have any questions what funding and donations go towards please feel free to ask as we don't have any reason to hide this from the community. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:18:02
I just want to say one thing before this conversation goes anywhere. There are lots of supporters of what we're doing. There are lots of detractors. This is what makes the Bitcoin and similar technologies community so great. Conversation, debate, innovation. We are excited to be working on something we think has lots of promise. There are tons of other projects that have lots of promise.
Our team has presented at Ethereum meetups and spoken with other folks from other great projects like Counterparty and BlackCoin. We love it all. There's no room to hate on enthusiasm and excitement.
We sacrifice a lot to try and progress the technology. Our time that can be spent with families, friends, or resting from our day jobs. Other devs across the community do the same thing because we're passionate about what we do. 
The things that keep us going are your support. We watch donations come in, code commits be submitted, great comments and suggestions come in. This is what drives us. We can only make this happen if we work together. So find something you like and do your best to support it. If that's Bitcoin, Ethereum, MaidSafe, NXT, BlackCoin, whatever. Just do it. You can never feel bad about contributing to something bigger than yourself.
@_date: 2014-09-07 00:40:06
First off I just want to say that I did not write this article and Angel's perspective is his own. I certainly have received no job offers based on my work with OpenBazaar so there's that. I certainly don't expect to get any anytime soon as well.
Secondly Angel's optimism for working on the project shouldn't be misconstrued for some "Come work with us and conquer the world". The following and excitement is not something we have manufactured. I wish I knew how to do that; I would have done it on my other ventures for sure. 
Perhaps you are right about the future of OpenBazaar. I certainly don't hold a crystal ball and it's up to the users to decide what is sold and where we go from here. I'm helping to create a great piece of software and a new place that seems to be needed and wanted. Naysayers such as yourself don't dissuade me from doing what I do. In fact I usually don't like to respond to much, but you took the time to write such a long response that I felt like I owed it. 
The "risk" you speak of is your opinion and you are entitled to that. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:50:06
Nodes will be able to filter out listings they support on the network for storage if they are cleartext. We are still hashing out the details of this, but is a point of concern for us as we move along. None of us want to store that information on our machines. That being said we will be most likely encrypting listings for storage which means you won't be able to tell what most data is anyways. You won't have child porn just laying on your hard drive if thats what you're asking.

These are risks all the parties involved will take. Third parties will have to decide if they want to take the risk. Arbitration will try and decide what happened and who is right.

1) The name open bazaar is something I came up with during the whole name controversy for Dark Market. The whole idea is taking the mess that ecommerce has now become and replacing it with this concept that more closely resembles how bazaars were long ago. We also needed something that is unique enough to make marketing and branding the project actually possible. Free market would have made googling us impossible, although I do think making people say Free Market all the time made us laugh.
2) I won't comment on "hacking" services, but services whatever they are could be sold on OpenBazaar using our contracts. We aren't and can't police the contract terms on the network so whatever you put out there goes out there as long as you have a taker.
3) I'll leave the judgment of what you're doing to others, but if you're trying to say you like the idea and support us cheers to that. Keep in mind our goal is to create a marketplace protocol and network regardless of the type of goods or services presented. We hope that the network will be used for any type of product not just illicit ones.

The fundraising at this point is paying for any small amount of marketing we want to do (i.e. conference table/flyers/etc.) and infrastructure for hosting our website and forums as well soon our seed servers which will bootstrap the network so there are minimal costs. 
Escrow agents (arbiters) are market supplied. You could be an arbiter if you wanted to. These individuals can take a fee if necessary to resolve a dispute during a transaction, but most times will not be needed. These data points are all hosted by the nodes not by us so there's no cost there as the network grows.

Dude this is a highly speculative market that everyone understands the risks of. That's such a cop out. Let me go protest Silk Road 2, because it's unfair they stole my coins.

There may be no benefit, but why pay Amazon seller fees if you can set up a storefront easily and have reach beyond where Amazon or others limit you? Also on the customer protection side there is a reputation system for merchants that can't be modified by the marketplace at their discretion. There are numerous reasons why decentralized marketplaces will benefit buyers and sellers. It's up to the Amazons to figure out a business model that works on top of that with added services.

Why can't people contribute to our project if they want to? Just because you feel like OpenSSL is more important doesn't mean others shouldn't contribute to different projects. Why is that hilarious?

That's a fair critique and we still have a long way to go before we earn that attention, but that's not a good enough reason to ignore our project.

I think this is a very interesting proposition. I wonder though if perhaps it's something we progressively get towards. There are so many other pending issues to deal with I think we need to focus on the core market issues like the design of the protocol and how interactions between actors in the transactions will occur. I'm going to listen to everyone though and we can come to consensus and probably build it out on an experimental branch to test it out.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:21:46
We are going to support external image links in the future. For now the main issue with supporting larger images is that they make the contracts very large to pass around the p2p network. We do realize this is important though and will be supporting it as soon as we can.
@_date: 2014-06-20 13:43:21
This may be something we pursue depending on resources. We're still a small team so we are trying to tackle the core tasks first and expand beyond that. The easiest way to bootstrap it for now will be to abstract out the Tor proxy piece, but this is a good suggestion.

No one knows the future. If you believe that it will go up eventually then you're just working to amass as much coin as possible for the lowest average price. You're more likely to turn a profit if you can lower your average price. Yes those original shares are a loss but your net profit overall is a new profit. Conceptually you are right but it's the net profit that should more important not dwell on the few coins you bought at a shitty price. That's all I'm saying.

We don't have to compete with them. People strive to be free and unencumbered with the limits that ClosedCathedral places on them. When a small business takes a look at the amount of fees they pay Ebay or whomever each month just to sell widgets and hair bows and realize they pay no fees to sell on the OpenBazaar network where do you think they will go?

You can't really do keyword searching against hashes though. How would that work?
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:47:37
So this is where it gets exciting. OpenBazaar initially will allow you to add keywords to your listing which will be searchable across the network. Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) don't really make searching across the network a fun experience BUT with our client you will be able to search keywords, bookmark your favorite markets/merchants, and search deep within individual markets. If someone puts the keyword "green human" or whatever you could easily find those results. Fuzzy searching might be difficult to support right now.

They haven't run off with the money (yet) so wtf. Aren't they just trying to solve the problem?

Would you make that leap? We currently do not pay our devs other than tip4commit indirectly and we are accomplishing goals so far. Donations would allow us to possibly do more, but are not our driving motivation for this project. While we would love to do something like this full-time, our donations thus far would never support that. Our plan is to provide something to the community that is useful before we ask too much in return. It's not the user's job to make us do something, it's up to us to prove to the community that we can be a valuable tool.

Third it's a much safer assumption than they are intentionally fucking everyone over considering they've been around quite a whole, clearly participate in development and are at least meeting with protesters rather than telling them to fuck off.

IMHO I think FreeMarket is way too overloaded of a term not to mention it's going be very hard to acquire the proper domain, plus I think FreeMarket also sounds too much like America Fuck Yeah! Don't get me wrong, I'm American, but this project is aimed at unifying people across the globe, not exclusion or patriotism.
That being said, I think we need to get past the name discussion at some point and start building, which is what I've done with some help from a few others.

Perhaps he felt this was the way to be transparent by bringing to light the issue. All of this bullshit is speculation. Not one of you all have looked at their code, understand their development process, or decision making workflow. Just want your magic internet money to increase in value. Maybe he is a douche who doesn't care, but he runs one of the largest exchanges and has so for a long time. I understand they are "positioning" themselves as a "reputable" business but there's no regulation so don't fucking tell me you have your life tied up in it. Let's see you use for your money back.

These are all great questions. One of the differentiators I believe between OpenBazaar's (OB) network and MaidSafe or Bitcoin for that matter is that the content that is shared within the DHT is not critical for execution of all operations within OpenBazaar. A marketplace that is set up on OB will have all of it's own listings within it's system and be accessible directly by any other node on the network without having to necessarily discover via the findNode request over Kademlia. I imagine many users will find the nickname or address for the market they want to shop from somewhere other than the OB client and just go right to the source. Will the store have to be online for this to happen? Yes, but I imagine most people running a serious marketplace will keep their node up 24/7. 
So as far as churn is concerned, all the nodes within OpenBazaar are planned to have a republish cycle that will automatically periodically republish their listings across available nodes and refresh keyword indices etc. Nodes leaving the system can also broadcast a leaving message to their routing table and then that can also trigger refresh. 
I plan on doing tons more research over the coming months to ensure we're addressing this concern, but I am not a p2p genius and am willing to solicit input from individuals as yourself who might have great ideas. That's the primary goal of us coming forward at this time and working with the community. This is not a finished product, but one that is only a month and a half old.
We are currently looking at PoW methods that could be used for publishing listings as well as some other ideas and do plan to address this as early as possible. We don't want to fight spam after the fact.
Feel free to come join us in  on Freenode or in our forums ( and help out where possible! We can always use good minds!

Yet we are! How crazy? :P
I think you are misunderstanding what we are at a fundamental level. We are not a "shop". We are a network that allows everyone to have a shop that talks to everyone else's shop with no middlemen "shop". Without us placing ourselves in the role of arbiter for every transaction by force, where would you propose we insert a fee structure?
I never said that we would not seek out compensation in some form or fashion for the devs and people who help build the network. It will just not come in the form of fees on transactions for using our network. I believe this would hamper uptake and put us in the role of being a centralized power.

You could choose to host no listings but either way we still require mongo at the moment for storage. We are looking to move to SQLite but you would still have persistent storage in our client. Someone else could build a lightweight version that does differently I assume.

It's not so misleading as it is a supported fork by the unsystem team. If you go to the unsystem forums ( you will see OpenBazaar under the Projects category. DarkMarket follows their branding and as they are not very active in the development of this project at this time we have named it outside of that branding.

I agree in principle but in reality I don't know how well it works. That's why systems like Ethereum actually might be good for this since the system automatically calls margins and there's no wiggle room requiring human intervention.

Why necessarily does revolution need money to drive it? Why does every project strive to create an appcoin to raise millions for it's devs? Don't you ever wonder why projects get hammered for all of these fundraises for promises they can't keep? Or create these unsustainable appcoins that get leveraged as a pump and dump. 
OpenBazaar is not a get rich scheme for us. While it's tempting for most to just abuse the trust and good nature of those who want to ride the next big wave, our goal is to produce something not take your money and run to enrich ourselves.
If you have ever talked to or met with any of the project team you would understand this.

@_date: 2014-07-22 18:37:58
First of all as I've mentioned before (as project lead) this Reddit post is not ours and is not endorsed by the project. Not that we don't appreciate it, it is just not an official request for money. You have every right to be skeptical as we have not put out any formal release yet and that is why we are not raising money proactively. We have funding donation addresses on our site because we are constantly approached by people who want to support the cause.
A lot of the code at this point is not forked code. There have been over 600 commits and many changes to the source since we inherited it. To say this is disingenuous and untrue. A lot of people have dedicated a lot of hours to get where we're at.
Another point of criticism you had was that we are promising a Halo 7. I don't know where any one of our devs has promised anything resembling some overly sophisticated piece of software. In fact one my main points that I make to them constantly is to keep the scope small and focus on the important things. This is complex software to build with many potential pitfalls and we're trying our best to do it right. 
That being said, if you think the code is a mess and you have the talent to identify and fix what you are talking about we'd love to have you onboard to participate. Maybe someday we will have a comfortable pot to pay everyone nice salaries out of to work full-time but for now we're content with doing our best to do this without traditional funding that's all. 
Our team are students, IT engineers, biology researchers, authors, and parents as well. We'd much rather have your participation than your money, but both can help this project as we grow and get closer to making it a reality.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:26:59
Because we rely on Bitcoin at the moment, we will be constrained by that ceiling to start with. As the Bitcoin userbase grows though so does our potential market.
I have a feeling if we do it right then there won't be much need to bootstrap this. There won't be any sketchy Tor site to go and try and visit if you want to use this as an everyday mom and pop online store. We will provide the ability to do what you need to do anonymously if you so choose through our SOCKS proxy support.

@_date: 2014-05-10 03:12:38
I am not really convinced that the listings need to persist that dramatically. They seem more ephemeral than that. There are multiple use cases I suppose. One where your store is like a true ecommerce business that needs to be available 24/7 and the products don't really change, one like eBay where you have timed auctions, and possibly like Craigslist where it's a one time deal that just simply expires. Explain to me why you think a listing should just be written permanently into the blockchain where miners have to protect it and fees have to be paid to submit it?
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:54:58
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:48:08
One of the most attractive parts of this is that you control your marketplace. You can download a software package of your choice to manage your market and everyone talks over the same p2p network just like you do with your Twitter client or your bittorrent client. You're no longer limited to what eBay provides you. Yes it won't offer the depth and breadth of services that Amazon has at the moment, but someday even they will be delivering products in a distributed way to some capacity.
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:28:30

That's not a good justification for your statement. There are so many good reasons to back the idea of a CA and you chose to pick on PGP? The one technology that we are pretty sure is water tight secure from prying eyes for decades? Sure PGP isn't as user friendly as your neighborhood CA but at least it doesn't provide a convenient man in the middle organization to be exploited. Our browsers are cram packed full of bullshit CAs that you didn't validate or even know what they are. You call that trust?

OpenBazaar is not aimed at stomping out the competition. We are trying to make this concept a reality with a UX that is simple and effective for all users.

@_date: 2014-05-10 03:00:00
These are all good questions. I think there may be some desire to be able to pull listings and disappear as well rather than have them be forged in stone forever. The motivation for caching listings is interesting but if a store isn't online how can it process orders and if the store is online there's no problem serving up listings. We are not talking about permanent assets here. Why do we want a listing recorded for posterity? This is like torrents. You could index listings but you still can't buy until a store is online.
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:01:59
Congrats they have to actually clarify that BU is not Bitcoin Uncensored.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:24:05
I am sure we will continue to have to address this issue time and time again. We are building a censorship resistant platform for conducting ecommerce. When I say censorship resistant that also means OpenBazaar. We are building the foundation to what could possibly be a very complex market or markets on the Internet and how it is used is still a foggy future for us. OpenBazaar plans to support, promote and encourage positive usage of the network, but will there be edge cases where people intend to use it to do negative things? Surely.
So there is one aspect that I can share in this respect though. Nodes on the network are responsible for storing copies of listings/contracts as a convenience and redundancy (if the store is offline for instance). You could choose to not support certain types of contracts to be stored on your node and those would have to go onto other nodes as a result. This could be a way to stifle the propagation of listings you don't agree with. Obviously anyone with a direct connection to a certain store could still find the listings directly without your consent though so your impact is limited.
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:42:02
Please keep in mind Tor is only one small part of ensuring that OpenBazaar is responsibly private and secure for all use cases on the marketplace.

"Interesting" is a pretty subjective idea don't you think? It seems to me there are a lot people interested in what we are offering. Maybe because you have such a strong opinion about this that it angers you and confuses you why people would disagree with you? That just seems kind of short sighted. 
Also I would hardly call your approach as "explaining". You insult us calling us stupid and incapable, liars, frauds. I spend most of my waking time working on this and working with others doing the same. Even if your critiques resonated everyone here thinks you guys are assholes.

I respect the sentiment, but who is responsible when the kid defaults? The parents. As a father of two boys I would love if they were savvy enough to do the things you guys speak of, but at the very least they need oversight of their activities at such a young age. Just look at all the App Store purchase stories you hear where "responsible" kids make mistakes. Now if a parent wants to act as the responsible party and be liable for anything the kid fucks up then maybe I see your point. Otherwise I think it's a disaster to let "most" kids loose on financial instruments with any serious amount of money.

1) Nodes speak to each other over our P2P network, which is loosely based on Kademlia. I will post some deeper info on this but it should get you started on Google if you want to know the details. Lots of questions here and I will get to this eventually.
2) Some data is propagated across the p2p network and other information is only stored on nodes. Some of it in the Bitcoin network obviously. Depends on what part you're asking about. We will be improving the documentation as we go to explain this more clearly. 
3) Encrypted messaging will be included. GUIDs (unique identifiers on the network) are RIPEMD160 hashes of the nodes signed pubkey so you can verify their key when they send it to you during exchange. We also will give people the ability to place their secure communication data (Bitmessage address, PGP key, etc.) on their store page if they choose to do their chatting out of band.
4) MaidSafe does this well and we are going to most likely follow in their footsteps in terms of revoking keys on the network. You can read up there on the details of how they're doing it. We're still working through it.
5) Still working the spam/DDOS. Hold tight.
6) Our plans for the web of trust are going to incorporate handling sockpuppet threats. More details to come soon.
7) Dark Wallet can be used as any other Bitcoin wallet. It is agnostic.

I seriously doubt that everyone gets every message is a very scalable solution. In fact I'd go as far as to say at scale this system would become much more centralized and less secure than OpenBazaar. It works now when there is no volume, but I think you're severely underestimating the challenges you'd see if this model ever saw serious usage.

There are a lot of added bonuses to this model including unforgivable reputation, built in encrypted ordering, arbitration and most privacy. If you have an ecommerce site that's great but you're operating under a different business model and you're segregated from the rest of the vendors that sell for bitcoin. Your argument could be said the same for eBay or Craigslist. Why not just stand up an ecommerce site? There are some cool reasons to use this but it's not necessarily for everyone.

The whole point of OpenBazaar is to help remove hurdles of using Bitcoin. It allows users to take advantage of minimal fees to increase their margins and help to usher in the possibility of completely fiat free economies. I think you are highly underestimating the demand by even regular people for a more flexible, free open ecommerce protocol. To say there is zero demand is trolling at best. At the moment yes perhaps my grandmother isn't interested, but every project starts somewhere and our investors, the people who donated and the thousands here who believe in our work show there's early demand for this capability no matter how nascent. If Elon Musk listened to this hater, no one wants/needs it attitudes then he wouldn't have Falcon 9 today. 
I respect the conservative viewpoint that we already have good enough products on the market to do similar things. I don't expect to walk in anywhere and convince people we've discovered the holy grail of ecommerce, but tell me where else you will be able to capitalize on the powers of Bitcoin, network effect of a closed marketplace like eBay or etsy, and have the flexibility to build software and businesses on top of an open protocol with no restrictions. 
Sam may have hedged a bit on whether or not our early release meets all ecommerce requirements, but it's fair. We have a long ways to go to meet our long term goals. It's not marketing speak it's called transparency. Perhaps you're not used to that.
Oh and it's "there" not "their".

The overhead issue depends on a lot of things including first and foremost the type of merchant you're talking about. Of course this alternative is fairly simplistic to decades old solutions on the market. It takes time to establish that. Just because our implementation isn't available via an HTTP/S URL right now doesn't mean it won't or that we don't have that on our roadmap. Just because we don't have Tor compatibility at the moment doesn't mean we won't in the near future. You're just purposefully trying to portray us as inept in order to inflate your own position. 
You are purposefully ignoring all the great responses that Sam gave you for why we differentiate from a Shopify with Stripe integration.

In exchange for fiat? No. But by allowing you to sell your goods/services in BTC yes. 


OpenBazaar is not intended to solve the volatility inherent with Bitcoin. We never claimed to. If you cannot accept that then you should be using another service to get into a more stable currency. This is not a problem in our scope and we never claimed to help here.


They can. Why couldn't they? I don't believe we ever said that centralized solutions can't solve problems. Is it all or nothing here?

OpenBazaar in it's current state relies on libbitcoin servers not Core full nodes so it's not required for OpenBazaar so that would be a separate issue. Easiest way to get an OpenBazaar node up and running would be to have it running on a VPS rather than use your mobile data. Try  or any of the other VPS services available.
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:44:14
I actually agree, it's terrible, but you kind of missed the point. The point is actually that it's not about taking sides. It's about doing your own analysis on the integrity of segwit or other technologies and stop making it about personalities or oracles. I'm continually asked to stand in one corner and yell at others about what they should or shouldn't do or how they should think. 
I've done my part. I went to Shanghai and listened to the mining pools. I've talked to Roger. I've listened to the Core slackers tell me I'm an asshole and my project sucks when I challenge segwit or other ideas. I was here when BU fucked up their code and mined an oversized block. And many other scenarios that have helped to inform my position.
This video takes no real stance for or against segwit specifically and it's meant to be a satirical look at the overall situation, not to insult either specific side and judging by the response I think both sides are starting to get it.
No one needs to hear another endorsement from me about the benefits or downsides of segwit. We've all heard it over and over. I'd rather start seeing everyone looking at the ridiculous situation we've put ourselves in (somewhat similar to the stupidity of this video), have a laugh, and then help fix this shit. Together.

The software is peer to peer as nodes on the network share the burden of storing metadata necessary for discovering each other and finding contracts between each other. When one person wants to purchase a good or service from another person their nodes can enter an end to end encrypted session to conduct that trade. This session can include secure messaging/chat as well. All of the nodes form a network that requires no centralized point of control and you will not be able to achieve that with simply standing up a web site with Stripe payment processing.
@_date: 2016-01-28 04:03:23
This is a great question and for those stores that would rather manage their own store presence using web hosting or free services out there it might not make much sense! It's like Shitty Shopify!
For those that can see past this silly critique, it's a truly peer to peer software that yes in its initial incarnation will require users to run it on their own machine. We are evaluating IPFS and if things go as planned we won't require users to run their nodes full time so this complaint will be moot. 
I appreciate that it comes up every time we are mentioned, but maybe the software isn't for everyone and we are fine with that for now.

I take umbrage at this comment, because spending Bitcoins is one of the only really good use cases for Bitcoin at the moment outside of just holding it in your wallet and having a way to do it through p2p that doesn't rely on centralized institutions has many advantages. Bitcoin is the glue that enables this type of network to actually work properly through the use of multisig transactions so it's not just a "but with Bitcoin" project. 
This is the same tired "everything is fine" mentality that leads to no innovation in technology whatsoever. PayPal freezing user funds is just fine. eBay banning your account is just fine. Amazon producing a generic version of your successful product and then placing it right above yours on the search results for a cheaper price is just fine. Storing all your business proprietary information (sales histories, customer relationships) on their servers to let them sell it off is just fine. Having to run your own web servers and maintain them, then pay for advertising to drive traffic to my obscure domain, it's all just fine.
Why try to improve that situation? It's really awesome and there's no room for improvement.

I haven't heard Coinbase cry at all so far. In fact they've been quieter than I would expect. Not sure what you're talking about. I do think however that people should more concerned at the level of control the core devs are trying to assert to hold on. It used to just be respect and proven history and now they have to be sneaky and underhanded to control the crowd. Just because it's Reddit doesn't mean we don't have a voice. Elitist attitudes all around. We start blasting the only companies competent enough to stick around longer than a year. Then we have clowns committing fraud just to stay relevant. What happened to submitting productive contributions like CLTV instead of hustling other companies.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:39:54
Just to clear up some of this. Our team is not that big. There are several folks who have some serious issues with Bitcoin Core and don't agree with the path being taken there. These are personal opinions and do not change the fact that OpenBazaar supports Bitcoin like it has since the first day we started the project. 
As for taking money from Bitmain, Jihan has supported us and our mission for free trade on crypto for a very long time and we appreciate his financial support (which was a minority stake in our A round) and if you judge us for that it's your prerogative. Jihan is too busy to spend much time really helping us "destroy Bitcoin" or any other nefarious conspiracy theories people have about it.
Our Haven branding is green because of some great work our design team did when researching and planning out our mobile application. It has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash branding. I love it personally and we've gotten great feedback on it so this is an absolutely petty ass point to bring up.
Chris is absolutely savage on Bitcoin Core. I don't intend to discuss his personal opinions here, he can defend his own positions. 
As far as me being an asshole, I can be at times. I like to think I'm evolving as a human being, but yep I like to talk shit sometimes, but I'm open minded. I won't elaborate on segwit2x as I've done so many many times before and that's that. In respect to making OB1 the ruler of OpenBazaar, the whole reason we made OB1 separate and didn't call the company OpenBazaar is because of that exact conflict of interest. We have several other projects and folks working independent tech around OB and we work and collaborate together. OB is also MIT licensed and open source so folks can do whatever they need to with the tech. We've spent a lot of money and time as a company essentially donating that to the community.
BCH is supported currency just like the others and there's nothing incorporated into the product that overly or underly supports it. As far as my personal opinions go I've always had mixed opinions because I feel that Bitcoin should have tried to stay more unified. I've seen both communities start to diverge further and establish their own priorities and I tend to ignore the politics around it anymore. I just really don't care.
And finally I still think is an asshole. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Look reasonably people will try to use the platform for illegal goods. That's inevitable. It does not provide the protections necessary to realize that vision. That was a perception placed upon the project from day one because it forked off of DarkMarket. There are a lot of people who expect many different things out of the project. Everything from a replacement for dark markets to just a different type of ecommerce experience. has a thesis that this will never work because it's just another shittier shopify, using his own words. And him and his group are working on building what they think is a better solution. Fine. Whatever. There's plenty of approaches there that we don't agree with nor think will succeed, but that's fine. I'm just tired of them trying to springboard off of what we're doing by painting us as something we're not. I don't think we've been opaque at all about what we are. You can't justify that by pointing to media articles. We control those as much as you do and they're pretty uninformed most of the time. Our investors and community contributors understand this as well. I welcome all (serious) questions about our motivations and goals. And I don't just mean questions like "Explain to your community why this won't work and you guys are idiots."
@_date: 2016-01-14 18:40:42
There is absolutely no doubt that there is demand for a clear DNM solution. With all projects you have to determine what your goal is. In my mind I think OpenBazaar can serve a much broader vision of commerce for the world than only that regardless of the demand. And perhaps you are right about the perception within the Bitcoin community that they are waiting for the next Silk Road, but I don't believe we have done much to cause that to happen and have not really misled the community as these guys would try to make you believe. 
As far as protections go all communication between nodes is end to end encrypted. You can run the backend on remote servers and have no data stored on your own machine beyond the client. Rather than store all data on the blockchain we have opted to be more cautious and careful about how we use it and ramp up persistent storage as we determine better methods. For instance we are evaluating IPFS which I think is a really promising tech. If you think we are just dumb and haven't considered all the limitations of this early version you'd be mistaken and we will continue to solve those in ways we believe are best. That also goes for Tor compatibility, mobile access and even how access could be done properly through a web browser. 
Hope that helps.

I'm not sure why we'd do it at the moment as IPFS and Blockstack and the stack that we're using would provide all of this and that would seem redundant. I'm always open to seeing new ideas though and if someone were to start working on a ZeroNet compatible version I'd be curious to see it.

First of all it's not a squirrel issue. OpenBazaar can be moved anywhere and also the DATA FOLDER we use can be moved as well. The point of squirrel is to not provide those options. Your opinion is yours. You don't need to all caps your argument, I'm reading it.
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:06:51
I meant within the squirrel installer. We use the squirrel installer because of the simplicity and the great auto-updater module that it provides as well. It probably would be nice for Windows users to be able to specify the location, but it's a tradeoff. 
It's not shittiness if the goal of your installer is not to require things like UAC on Windows to be required or hit users up with tons of questions and options during the install process. It's a philosophy. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:16:21
I like that segwit helps set up signature aggregation with Schnorr even though AFAICT it would require everyone to be online for multisignature support, which would be needed in OpenBazaar.
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:52:01
We could do that (or anyone could help us for that matter), but for the moment we're opting for building a completely independent browser based version. We've done this model before and it was fine, but we think the native desktop app is better. Our very first version that was spun off of DarkMarket was just a browser link and it always felt hacks.

I don't think squirrel is shitty. It provides a very simple and straightforward way for installing the app that gets right into it. If users would like more advanced installation options they still can it's just not provided through a detailed wizard.

It's really a shame to hear that, but unfortunately we do hear that. It's one of the big reasons we've decided to go with IPFS to replace a lot of the networking and connectivity code that caused so many problems for people. I'd really love to hear if you're able to connect and see nodes using the 2.0 version we're building out.

I used to enjoy content on Reddit that wasn't straight shitposting.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:44:11
First of all if you think that your last paragraph is quality content, I'll just stop you right there. Whether someone agrees with that assessment or not or if they deserve it or not, it's just a ranting ad hominem attack against BU. It's just uninteresting blabber aimed at getting people stirred up.
Conferences are almost always a place where the most you get out of it is the sidebar discussions and people you meet. If interesting people don't show up then they can be worthless. If you didn't get anything out of them it seems like you're wasting your own time as well as your business's.
I believe this year will be just like any other year where if the price is exciting and anything interesting comes out of the space it will be fun and happening. If the price is depressed and there's nothing to bring in new interest then it could be a rough year.
Overall I just think this post is probably better served a Facebook update than a discussion starter.
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:55:35
No problem. It's definitely not a slight to ZeroNet, I just think what they offer overlaps and we have a great relationship with the IPFS team and think what they're building is really promising.

You most likely don't want your mom to know you were hoping to buy drugs on OpenBazaar. But I want to let you know that the vision of a free market is still alive and well.

@_date: 2017-01-16 14:35:39
We made that architectural decision so you could run the 24/7 daemon on the cloud or a remote machine and then connect from any other PC if you wanted. We also wanted the client to interact more with the desktop so we went with Electron wrapper around the web app. If you wanted to use the browser it's completely possible to build a version that does so, but you'd still have to run the server daemon somewhere, which would cost you something and your time.

You really have blinders on. I did not specify that Core is the reason for the bad situation in Bitcoin. You're conflating two ideas to support your agenda. My third paragraph was about Bitcoin in general and I nowhere specify it being Core's sole fault. I said anyone outside of the core team mostly gets hammered (by the community at large). They're not the only ones in the community and I was not implying that they're the only ones shitting on new ideas.

 Third article down. Still available.
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:14:22
First off, right up front: I have never said I was against on-chain scaling (or off-chain scaling for that matter) and I'm certainly not railing against segwit. And as far as our business model at OB1 goes, there is no value to shit on any potential idea that could bring Bitcoin to everyone. I do support scientific critique of all ideas though, which I think is hard to disagree with.
I also am not shitting on the Core dev team. I think their accomplishments along with anyone else who ever contributed have been incredible and from someone whose only accomplishment to the core code was a PR for proofreading that was closed almost immediately I certainly have no reason to complain about their work. 
My concerns mostly relate to the longevity of this project due to the way conflicting ideas and people are treated. There has for quite a while been a situation in which I believe competent developers either are turned off by the perception that Bitcoin is a clusterfuck or that they find the prospect of getting new ideas into the codebase too daunting. I've seen this from non-Bitcoin people we have hired and from within my extensive developer network. Anyone outside of the core team mostly gets hammered on all sorts of personal levels including motivations, past projects/failures, personal flaws, which I'm assuming is why the Mimblewimble creator is anonymous. 
I've spoken to several people about my concerns and the responses have mostly been positive and frustration for why parts of the community are so against what they're creating. There is certainly a massive team of blind supporters on both sides willing to attack the others at will. It used to be just scholars and scientists fighting over the merit of new ideas, but it's progressed to full on trolling, which creates even more disarray. I'm not sure at this moment what the solution is.
I fully expect to see these responses:
a) BU is right
b) Core is right
c) Bitcoin is what it is; no one can do shit about it (The MrHodl Theory of Life)
d) This is why altcoins rule
I try almost always to not shit on people personally or directly and rather their ideas. I won't hesitate to call people out on shitty behavior not bad ideas and will still suggest and help on making the community better however I can. And all of you are most welcome to call me out on my own actions as this thread purports to do. You can always ask me my opinion as well rather than shitpost it on Reddit for speculation.
P.S. It's OpenBazaar one word.

I appreciate the work that's gone into this post and assume that OP is trying to be genuine here to warn users. One of the most important aspects of projects with finite time and budget is not recreating things that already exist. One of those is blockchain identity. An identity platform was never really a true goal for the OpenBazaar project or part of our scope. So looking at alternatives is part of this project. I feel like OP is this same individual once again trying to start a war here about this topic. Using Onename will not be mandatory and is more of a convenience for users who have those accounts already. You claim the names are all taken. First of all Facebook has a billion users and people are still getting vanity URLs. If there are other name schemes others would like to be considered we would be glad to do so. Come to our Slack and pitch. This work also has to be done so if you can help build come help. We don't have the manpower or time to reinvent this capability right now. We thought this would be a convenient and useful capability for users to have memorable user handles and their team has actually volunteered to help us integrate it unlike anyone else pitching alternatives.

@_date: 2015-07-27 17:09:29
It's not laziness. We consciously said that identity and user handles was something already being explored by folks with money and time. If we can leverage an existing technology why reinvent the wheel? In fact it's actually counter-productive IMHO to do so, because what's the point in other groups creating tools w/in the Bitcoin community if no one will use them. Saying we're funded by prominent VCs and therefore in bed together is kind of a silly argument. They also funded Twitter and we use that. Also a16z funded Slack which we use too and many others. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:46:44

I don't consider myself anti-corporate. I consider myself as someone who would like to force corporations to provide true value rather than resort to exploitation or manipulation of users to make more profit. 
We started OB1 as an example of that belief and our support of open protocols and technology demonstrates that belief. 
Onename is a corporation as much as we are and as you pointed even has the same investors. One important thing you fail to highlight though is that we both aim to provide valuable services at the edge of the open network not in the middle of it.
That would leave us tempted to corrupt or abuse the system we created and we are not aiming to do that. We are not working with Onename to create some super profit generating conspiracy. We work with them because we feel they share the same beliefs about open networks and actually help us out by providing useful technology. 
Why on earth would we want to create a scheme where stores couldn't get their preferred names on purpose. It's a unique challenge but we are not trying to capitalize on some username squatting. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 15:35:52

@_date: 2015-07-22 03:25:44
I don't understand why you're so butthurt about us working with Onename in any capacity. First of all if you followed the project at all you'd know we planned that long before we even though of getting VC. In fact I didn't even realize they were funded by USV until we already secured a discussion. Secondly as was pointed out it's optional. Thirdly it's not odd that companies funded by similar VCs work together. You probably wouldn't know that because you're not busy building technology and businesses and would rather complain and try to get people riled up.

The whole idea that anyone who wants more people to use Bitcoin has a conflict of interest is asinine. The real argument is around whom should be the group of people who use it more, banks or average joes. The idea that Bitcoin is bigger than a cup of coffee is what bothers me. It basically says look this is so important that institutions are the ones that should shepherd this. We can create these layers on top for those that want to use it for those silly trillions of consumer transactions.

I always enjoy seeing comments where someone is so bitter about OpenBazaar existing because Internet. This argument is a fun one because there's always multiple ways to accomplish something. If you want to take the time to set up a website or use a centralized service and don't value the things that make OpenBazaar different then I would recommend anyone in that position to do so. Just as many people do not prefer to acquire their digital files through BitTorrent or FTP servers when they can download through a web site, stream with Spotify or use the iTunes Store. All viable alternatives. 
When someone tries to take shots at OpenBazaar for being worthless I always chuckle a little because if every developer, entrepreneur, or business person listened to this kind of short sighted criticism we'd still think the world is flat and we'd most likely not even have the Internet to debate this on.
I still welcome this argument though as it does give us ideas for the future on how to make it more relevant to as many people as possible, which is our goal in the end.

Last time I checked Gavin has almost 500 commits on Bitcoin source so I find it hilarious you dismiss his competency. I don't know why anyone listens to you. What exactly are your credentials? Julia, you come to Blockstreams defense but completely ignore Gavin's contributions. I'm not really sure what authority you have to make these critiques. 
There are still plenty of political issues within the community (there seems to be a lot progress being made), but to blame it all on Gavin and Mike is as bad of a mentality as the herd mentality on I don't understand how you're any better insulting people with your "limp wrists" comments. 
I don't care who you are, but you make a difference with your code and intellectual input not propaganda videos. It's nice you have such fervor for Bitcoin, but this article is not inspirational. It's a fuck you to anyone who disagrees with the notional roadmap.

You keep replaying that as if it's some kind of mantra of mine. You obviously have a very tough time with understanding my comments. I have no control of commits on segwit2x and the position seemed to be to kill the minority chain by not offering automatic replay protection. I was not advocating that as best course. But keep repeating this so I have to keep responding. I'll still be here.

Bcash followed through on replay protection and you still troll the subreddit. So you're saying if replay protection was implemented you would continue to harass the segwit2x crowd and that would be...less of a shithead move? I smell a hypocrite.
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:04:15
Look I understand why people disagree about NYA. We are clearly seeing that scaling block size larger will decrease fees and get people excited about using Bitcoin again. I just want to see if through some kind of agreement among important players in Bitcoin that we might find additional immediate scaling. I don't support hostile takeovers of Bitcoin. I would support it for my own project. If it is obvious in the few weeks running up to November that there is no semblance of agreement among parties then I will back away from my position. Whatever leads to the most likely outcome of a strong, unified Bitcoin is where I intend to be.

Nope. Continue on. We actually are aiming to be coin agnostic and so therefore would love to accept any valid coins. This does not change with segwit2x.

@_date: 2017-10-05 14:18:58
This is a tricky one. I think there are competent devs on both sides but I never really imagine them as being two different teams really until this massive war. The idea I supported was for the two groups to move forward somehow together. I know that seems unlikely to happen but I hold out a tiny shred of hope. I don’t have a massive amount of confidence in any team that does not include the current core devs in general. This is why I don’t really care about or support Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:35:49

There is which conflict? OpenBazaar is an open source project and your welcome to come give your feedback on the situation. Right now our users can use OpenBazaar with the built in SPV wallet built off btcd which will follow the longest chain or Bitcoin Core which we already know what it will do.
There are no specific segwit2x plans to force our users into.
@_date: 2015-09-04 21:18:14
I guess we've passed through the hostile phase and are now onto the acceptance phase. It would be more effective if people just treated others with respect and stop getting hung up on corporate affiliation.
Part of getting respect though is giving it and we need to realize the community is extremely diverse in ideas and positions.  I think the reason Blockstream gets so much shit is because they've created this dream team of engineers and scientists and everyone outside feels like this could be some attempt to wrangle control from everyone else.
It was somewhat surprising to see sentiment turn so quickly from when they announced their funding. We are all in this together and we are not stronger by being so divisive.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:21:51
Attack is just desperate rhetoric. If part of the market disagrees it’s an attack right? I respect Core devs to fight for their view of what Bitcoin is and should be and have my own opinions. 
It’s a real nice soundbite that DCG paid us to support but also stupid. I’m sure Jihan could have paid us a lot more money than 200k to do what he wanted. Just silliness.

That's how I heard it as well.
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:32:29
What's the reality of the state?
Sacking Core never was the goal and I do not support. See various places I reiterated this. Kill the Core chain was not my idea and never advocated. I'm watching to see how development and planning progresses to properly handle the fork and replay protection.

I don't think smart VCs are doing this at all. In a business that is nascent and the market is unproven it makes more sense to conserve your cash as much as possible and control your burn rate. Much of this spending was probably exacerbated when the price of Bitcoin went up, which was a false indicator of market growth and demand and led to a scaling up prematurely.

One thing not accounted for is that energy consumption will continue to decrease and therefore become more affordable to run more CPUs rather than just more powerful CPUs. Not to mention a nice advance in nanotubes could easily accelerate growth once again in just a few years.

@_date: 2015-09-25 11:56:15
This is pretty typical for first generation companies in a new space. Some will get big fast and spectacularly blow out and others will stay small and lean and survive the first few years where pickings are slim in terms of profit. Eventually things will start to stabilize as we figure out what Bitcoin really is good for and who the true audience will be. The key is surviving until then.
@_date: 2015-09-18 15:30:40
I see what you did there
@_date: 2015-09-25 13:53:16
Well I can't speak for the investors involved with this deal, but I do know that smart/good VCs would not sacrifice the overall deal to force them to grow too fast. It makes no logical sense. Investors know that a deal may take 5-7 years for an acquisition on average and longer for an IPO. They would rather see consistent, steady growth rather than rocket ship implosion I would imagine. That being said, depending on how much equity was given out, the company is solely responsible at the end of the day for the strategy and execution. If your VCs are pushing you to just raise more money I would say you're screwed either way. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:38:28
I believe it will come back up for debate in January so don't go buying a boat quite yet.
@_date: 2015-09-06 13:19:11
Why do we need to spend more time trying to verbally convince others to use Bitcoin. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the value proposition of disappearing messages, photos or videos (Snapchat) so why can't we just work on building products and services that actually help the average user. 
Work on making terminology not so cryptic and software easier to keep secure and functional. Providing valuable software/hardware/services is the quickest way to increase Bitcoin adoption.

First of all this podcast is bullshit and not very factually accurate. See the comments for explanation by people actually associated with the project. I don't understand how it has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It uses only Bitcoin as the method of payment, leverages multisignature transactions and also uses the blockchain for storage of reputation information. What else should it do to be considered a "Bitcoin" project?

This is why we are creating OpenBazaar. We need to learn to embrace Bitcoin and stop building so many damn bridges into and out of fiat. It's going to be a long, hard slog but that's where the value proposition is. A global currency that doesn't need to go in and out of fiat.

We need people, but more importantly businesses (lots of them) using Bitcoin to bring stability. This takes time. There are many challenges to be addressed to bring this to bear. Obviously there are scalability concerns, usability concerns, public perception issues, and many others. We can chip away at this as time goes by so that we move past a speculative toy into a deeper, richer and unstoppable global necessity.

I think your definition for troll is pretty watered down. Satirical voiceovers on serious videos is not trolling. Secondly it's surprising that you think there is no time for anything outside of running a startup. Comedy can be a stress relief you should try to laugh once in a while if you don't.
@_date: 2015-10-14 22:03:14
Hah keeping it real. I like this. You're right fuck the hype.

What's an economic node exactly?

Bitcoin is not for settling up small bills. This is permissionless storage of value.

Most likely NDAs would be between Blockstream and other individuals and companies and not with Greg directly

a16z invested in OB1, which is several of us aiming to provide valuable services to OpenBazaar users outside of the core project and network. There will be no attempt to monetize the open-source project directly through fees or the like.

As kind of half joking but seriously shitty attitudes kill any chance at consensus and productivity. There are exceptions to every rule though; look at the Linux kernel.

Didn't expect people to pick apart the butter remark. Butter runs very well thank you.

I think you are conflating p2p with decentralized. It was a centralized facilitating p2p trade.

There are only six items for sale. Is that right?

Ahh apologies then. True.

nice move. no one said we weren't supportive of the policy.

OK I saw the article is old.

Not defending illegal listings but where do you get your info from? How shall the OpenBazaar team be compelled exactly?

So he introduced the roadmap that's been around forever? Did I miss anything new here?
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:40:25
Well it's all one big experiment so perhaps time will reveal that my understanding is incorrect.
@_date: 2015-10-14 18:41:00
Oh no worries just I saw that on the first page. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:08:11
How is it free? It says 0.5% listing fee.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:55:22
You're delirious. I thought you had a better grasp of the market speaking. BIP148 is not what they're speaking for. Regardless of the hats.
EDIT: I'm not ignoring James Hilliard's contribution or anyone else, but let's not pretend like BIP-148 made this happen alone.
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:25:50
Our Google Hangout tomorrow night will give everyone an opportunity to ask questions about the direction of the project and hear it straight from some of the devs why we're doing what we're doing.

Sick ride
@_date: 2016-07-21 02:35:41
Join our slack (slack.openbazaar.org) or email project and we can help. This is not very detailed so hard to say.
@_date: 2016-07-08 12:47:37
I'd like to see the results of this research project. It sure seems like there are a lot of people willing to put money into projects to fund development and grow them. There have been millions of dollars poured into other coin projects and the DAO itself was a direct example. Blockstream is not the only method of funding project development.
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:43:16
Haha what??
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:58:43
If you knew anything about the project you'd know there is no way for us to censor the protocol as a project regardless of threats.
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:41:04
I was going to say this is almost a straight rip of the Bitcoin Uncensored podcast and then saw the closing acknowledgement. Why not just credit Chris DeRose with this article? 
@_date: 2015-11-26 16:45:40
Actually I still think you have to pull down software from their servers to finish installing.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:12:32
Most users are vetting vendors and other users outside of the OpenBazaar product and community. They're relying on a plethora of pre-existing platforms to validate trustworthy individuals and also communicating through the messaging capability. There's always room for improvement, but I'm not convinced that adding yet another complexity for folks to wrap their head around is improving the situation. No one wants to put up money to purchase anything, especially when buying something of no consequence. I think the whole MAD model is only helpful for a very small subset of situations.
@_date: 2016-07-21 01:35:41
What was removed?&gt;
@_date: 2016-07-08 12:42:01
I don't know if I have an exact one, but the wording in places is almost identical to their constant comments on the show. I'll see if I can find one.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:08:17
How bad would that be? Even thinks the current situation is fine.
@_date: 2016-07-31 21:19:04
Is this the part where the burning bush yabbers on or do we receive the tablets now?
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:36:51
Which two? Because I believe I may have been one of the two who responded and I never said we wouldn't just that we weren't sure what we were doing could technically meet 
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:08:47
it's now bitcoin-ml.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:13:32
This is not true. We made that determination well before we even talked to investors.
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:49:21
Stop making sense. This doesn't fit the narrative.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:41:35
There were many things that made us feel like we didn't meet expectations as well, which is why we made such a drastic re-architecture on 2.0. Hopefully this one represents our future better!
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:29:32
Yeah, he's the worst.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:53:44
In before this gets downvoted to all fuck.

Don't spend all that in one place

This is a good thing for Bitcoin.

Fuck. I'll do it over.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:36:26
2 of 2 is an academic exercise and a horrible UX. It's not the way users behave in real life and only succeeds on paper. This doesn't even hold up in the crypto space let alone the mainstream user population. Hardly anyone prefers to use Bitcoin in general from that group let alone put down deposits. We all know the game theory but in the practical world it doesn't fly.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:02:52
So leave with an unbiased better understanding?
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:29:50
Hacked? This is a pretty weak move to remove his access on this one.

Ah to be new in the Bitcoin space again. This takes me back.
Check out Twister. This was attempted a while back.
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:40:50
I will try and make sure we support this, but it might require us to look into an alternate packager. You can always do this manually but it is annoying if you don't like tinkering.

You don't have to use the internal wallet if you don't want to. You can always just pay to a QR or address from your normal wallet.

I don't see anyone getting behind him. More like mocking him. It's more important to think of the effect that paypal accepting bitcoin would have on the ecosystem.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:22:36
It seemed like there was a lot of pressure at around 580-600USD earlier though. Not it's clearly pushing upwards faster.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:18:00
My father has only heard about the drug sites involved with it. My mother is intrigued but has no idea how to go about acquiring bitcoin. The biggest issue is that they wanted to do it without having me handhold them through the process. If someone has to usher you through every step it's not going to be scalable. This will probably have to get a lot better before it's got that low barrier to entry needed.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:14:22
Yeah this would be interesting. I think if PayPal for instance started integrating bitcoin this could be a use case.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:27:16
This really brings up an interesting issue to me. Can someone here explain why this is a strong potential to happen or why it's not? I don't know enough to make a judgement myself.
