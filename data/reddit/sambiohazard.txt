I have a question. Since bitcoin public keys can be generated offline, how network ensures that there are only unique public keys?
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:12:32
we can use bithalo for that. Both side pledge a deposit and if contract is broken both side loose. That will keep everyone honest without any trust.

whoa!! so generating same keys might happen in some equally big incomprehensible number of years. I guess I can comprehend it if all of the neurons in my brain fired at same time or I move to higher dimension. LOL. Thanks for the quick answer. I think theoreticians might be worried as it is still possible in theory. :P
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:44:57
I think something like sharechains of p2pool or a sidechain with lower confirmation time is something that can do this. I am not a programmer but this looks possible to me.

How do you like the content? Is it good, some new info.
I like the info he gets, you dont get that on any big outlets.
@_date: 2014-09-20 16:16:36
Why would that be? If they break the contract they will loose their deposits. Devs can release product only after payments are done.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:42:58
I think there is no need to protect anyone now that bithalo.org is released. If people are cautious enough then it is quite safe now I guess.

As I said if you are fine with all that I have no case. Personally, I havent invested directly in bitcoin but i build a mining rig for earning bitcoins via altcoins. Why? Because fiat exchanges ask my ID in digital format which I dont want to give anyone. Such info like credit card &amp; password are hacked every now and then. I am waiting for ATMs. I think you know about coinbase stories also.

@_date: 2014-05-21 02:33:54
Good way of taking bitcoin to more people.
@_date: 2014-09-20 16:47:48
Yeah you have a point, but if someone is really positive about a project then they shouldn't have a problem with a deposit. Although, this will be a problem for devs as they have get money for deposit as they are counterparty to the contract, which is the very reason they are crowdfunding.
@_date: 2014-09-13 17:42:54
no wonder there are less full nodes running. There should be some reward for full nodes as they are also important to the network. Faster propagation is less waste, less forking &amp; more reliable network. Am I right?
@_date: 2014-09-14 06:27:12
I never said there are no problems in developing countries that bitcoin cant solve but transition requires much more effort. In western countries pretty much everyone has internet connectivity so its just few clicks here and there and you have bitcoins. In south/south-east asia very small population has smartphone let alone internet. Although android is changing that, but internet penetration is pretty lame. Also, people need a strong incentive to let go what they know well for something new.
@_date: 2014-09-13 16:49:49
we sure will have moved past bitcoin by then or past the need for currency.
@_date: 2014-09-14 08:18:10
That DangPu service is more like bank loans and less like crowdfunding.
@_date: 2014-09-13 19:15:58
probably we should ask Randall Munroe of "What If" to answer this on his website.

@_date: 2014-09-14 17:52:27
What you are saying is my biggest fear with bitcoin, people leaving control of network to businesses and bigger players. We need to keep it decentralized and p2p. I really dont like how people are using payment processors for what can be done p2p.
@_date: 2014-09-02 18:29:59
If you are talking about no bitcoin regulation or tax as it is P2P, then i would say that consider these two scenarios.
As Bitcoin matures there is less centralization and it is harder to regulate it or we have less/no government then these taxes can be made voluntary and can be diverted towards Paying devs, nodes &amp; promotion.
If nothing changes we can use these taxes to attract wider adoption until Bitcoin matures. After that we know what to do.

Thanks for replying. Yeah I agree, but there are two reasons for this.
* WCN wants to be a news channel covering mostly crypto but also anything that promotes freedom of individual &amp; eroding of state power, which you will agree is main reason Satoshi invented Bitcoin.
* This is a historic event and Chris Ellis has been trying to do this kind of reporting where he tries to show the other side of a story, not covered by mainstream media. He also released the full audio of BBC click interview.
So, thats why we have been bringing daily updates from Hong Kong. We did long videos in the start so that we can show a tour of three main protest areas. Lately, we have decided to keep the videos short if there is no specific incident happening.
I hope you can now see the reason for these updates. We will try to make these more engaging in future. We haven't been editing these video so that there is no chance of skewing the events with a bias or of a accusation of doing so. We might upload  edited videos in future with more relevant content. This is the exact reason I have been doing these timestamps so that you can watch a relevant section if u find its description appealing.
The Bitcoin Group &amp; other shows are still being produced. This is not affecting any other shows except Chris Before Coffee as the host is  more interested in doing this.
Once again thanks for replying.

IMO bitcoin is a worldwide system to transfer value, so if you have something of value (mostly online service, goods that can be sold online), offer it for bitcoin. Also faucets &amp; tips are good way to get a feel for how things work.
@_date: 2014-09-02 12:31:47
If you are talking about taxing it the normal way then as Ozziecoin said it will be difficult unless everyone annonuces all their bitcoin public keys. IMO this will lead to taxation via TDS or Tax Deduction at Source.

I mean the control on what you can or cannot buy with your dollar, limit on amount you can transfer etc. If you get large amount of money then you have to tell them the source even if you have no criminal records. Things like that but if you are fine with that then I have no case. I agree to disagree respectfully. :)

I think it is the opposite. People in developed countries are more used to online payments and more prone to debt via credit cards. They have better internet infrastructure and more tech savvy population. It makes perfect sense to use bitcoin. Also, it eliminates any controls and gives you liberty to own yourself, which IMO is strongest case for using it.
On the other hand, developing countries have cash loving, non-tech savvy population and poor internet infrastructure. Although they are also prone to consumerism &amp; loan sharks but it is much steeper shift in lifestyle for them to justify it.

Would that matter if it is widely accepted? Who cares today what is price of dollars against various currencies before spending it. Except the forex traders.

If there were 28,000 nodes then at 1% per block every node will get 0.00128571 BTC per day or 0.03857142 per month. I think that is enough motivation for anyone to run a full node.[This link] ( says its $3 per month to run bitcoin node on AWS. Even 0.5% of each block will be a good profit for that. And this is with 4 times the node we have right now.

Thanks for your comment. I am thinking of posting directly to reddit. Did u read the article? How did u like it? I am saying the same thing with my article.

If miners are not greedy enough then we can take 1% of each block and distribute it to nodes. It is .25 BTC every 10 mins. It should be enough incentive than nothing :P
How to do it technically IDK as I am a noob when it comes to programming.
Also I was thinking of a tax from within protocol on mining centralization, like immune system defending the body and pay nodes &amp; devs using that. Totally eliminating need for BTC Foundation. But i think it is too vague/optimistic. Can it even be done? Also there are better ways to do it as discussed here.
