I am shooting for 10 bitcoins bro

Think about it bitcoin.com went on sale for a million dollars. Bitcoinsatan can be used for a satire site, a porn site, a negative news press site a black market and many much more. So I think its worth the price im calling it

If I got to wait a couple more years to get a better deal than will do. But that price is to low mane. I think that domain is worth 10 bitcoins today :)

Great! Please check your email for validation. It is a bitcoin wallet so you should see a balance of 1000 bits in your wallet the minute you validate your email :)

Sorry once again, that domain doesn't appease me as much as the one I am selling
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:38:58
No im serious

Yes I did after I had posted it on reddit. I don't want to taint nobody's reputation however it was very frustrating. Anyways they handle my withdraw just kind of sad I had to take this approach in order to get a response.
