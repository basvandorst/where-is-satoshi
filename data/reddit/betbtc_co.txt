At the moment only soccer, tennis and basketball. Would you like to see it added?
@_date: 2014-12-01 05:25:11
can you please tell me where are you getting that error?
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:39:47
0.01B but since we are in beta, once you sign up for an account, 5(fictional ) bitcoins would be automatically credited on you account for the trading cup / beta testing
@_date: 2014-12-01 05:06:33
why you think that?
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:07:46
Thanks for your feedback. We will consider that for Live.
However for now if you want to try you don't need to deposit anything since we are offering 5 demo bitcoins with all registrations. (real deposits/withdraws are off during beta)
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:21:15
We are implementing that feature as well!
Thanks for your feedback

Hello and thanks for your comment.
On BetBTC we act only as an exchange, this means that if someone puts a 10btc bet (or a small one...), it will only be matched if someone "on the other site" ==&gt; other user that has enought balance to cover the bet, accepts that odd.
We have no risk at any given time since every bet is covered by user's balance and we only profit from the fee deducted from winning bets.
Hope you understood.

Now with NFL - SuperBowl XLIX
@_date: 2015-02-06 05:28:07
This is the announcement of the campaign we just launched. We will offer reduced commissions to all users interested. I don't understand why you ask to avoid repetition since it's the first time we are running a campaign on reddit.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:01:03
SuperBowl was implemented!

The concept is totally different.
This is not a sportsbook but a Betting Exchange.
Cheers
