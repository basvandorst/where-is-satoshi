We're going mainstream any moment now, you guys! /s

Nice moving of the goalposts there, buddy.

I mean, he COULD charge 100% in cash then buy BTC with it...
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:41:55
If BTC could go to $10K then drop to $1K, then it would be a supremely shitty store of value.

Please. As if the crypto space wasn't festering with unchecked greed.

Guys. People bringing up tulips aren't saying a plant is analogous to a blockchain-based cryptocurrency. They're talking about something having value solely on the basis of a group of people deciding it does.
And although I certainly don't think the two situations are similar, it's still a valid argument that needs consideration. For all the talk of crypto disrupting world banks, so far Bitcoin's main application is as a pseudo-anonymous exchange token for online transactions. That by itself doesn't justify the crazy market price.
Bitcoin's value comes from speculation that the currency will be adopted far and wide in the future. It's a speculation based on sound analysis, but it's speculation all the same. And until that adoption is realized, we might as well be trading tulip bulbs. I'm betting we're not, but it's still a bet.

Not sure why you think I have a distaste for China. I'm trying to provide a more nuanced opinion than "Fuck China for crashing my Bitcoin portfolio." Also, I lived there a few years.

You need to go through a licensed exchange to buy a coin, and being licensed means they'll control which coins are allowed.
You might be able to buy non-related coins with foreign currency, but that's out of reach of the vast majority of Chinese citizens.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:35:29
You guessed wrong.
And for the record, I'm not saying China is doing any of this for the "good of the people." They're doing it to allow the market economy to function while still maintaining a grip on the flow of capital.

Heh. I have friends in Hong Kong so I'm aware the situation is far from perfect, but I was speaking strictly about the fears at the time of that the PRC would totally tank Hong Kong's economy. IIRC, they caused a housing recession by implementing stricter rules on housing, but otherwise the HK economic juggernaut marched on.

The BTC blockchain is an open ledger. If you have to exchange your CNY for a CNY tether, you're doing so through a PBoC-approved exchange that will control your identity. Then, when you exchange your tether for BTC on a licensed exchange, the Government also knows exactly how much BTC you generate. If (big if) you can get the BTC out of the exchange, the Government will see exactly where you're sending it. I'm willing to bet this step will require Governement oversight and approval.
It's not entirely different to sending money out of China through a traditional bank. You can do it, but it requires a lengthy approval process. That's exactly the level of control China wants on cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:28:36
You'd have to be in China and go through a PBoC-mandated exchange, I would guess. Not clear if they'd let foreigners in China buy tokens or if they'd reserve them for Chinese citizens.
As the whole point of the "digital yuan" would presumably be to prevent people from taking CNY out of China, I'm willing to bet they'll be almost impossible to buy outside the country.

Doh, of course. Got confused with the fact the lease to the UK was 99 years. Thanks for pointing this out, I'm fixing it.
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:36:06
Can you point out where in my post I say that China HAS to do this, or that their intention is to help the poor?
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:13:20
Absolutely, yes.
I'm not saying what China is doing is right; I'm saying they're not out to simply destroy the BTC investor market or tank the price of BTC to buy low.

In Stephenson's 1999 novel Cryptonomicon, he envisions a nationless cryptocurrency that would spell big trouble for fiat currencies. He posited it would need to be backed by actual gold to have any value, though, so he didn't quite predict crypto. Or did he...

When I talk about sending BTC abroad, I mean from a Chinese-controlled address (i.e. a licensed Chinese exchange) to a non-controlled one (including a personal wallet). You're totally right to point out that the Bitcoins themselves are not changing location as they exist in the distributed blockchain.
The exchange itself can control the flow of capital, though. All China has to do is force exchanges to get official approval before you're allowed to move BTC out of the exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:14:08
If you're rooting for crypto to overthrow traditional economies, sure. If you're concerned they're trying to tank the value of the BTC or destroy its potential, definitely not.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:17:23
I don't see why. It would just be a trade token pegged to the Chinese yuan. Not every crypto coin needs to be deflationary to be useful.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:31:02


That's exactly what's going on. They'll know who you are when you exchange your CNY for a yuan tether, and they'll know through the licensed exchange just how much BTC you generate through trading and where you send it. I suspect sending BTC to an address outside China will require exactly the kind of approval you'd need to send fiat outside the country.
In other words, you can trade BTC, but you can't use its anonymity features.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:32:12
If you need to exchange your CNY for a tether then can only trade it on a licensed exchange, it means they see exactly how you acquire your BTC and when and how you send it abroad. So yeah, they'll totally control capital streams while also allowing Chinese investors to play the crypto market.

Why are we listening to Kim Dotcom, again?

I have BTC, but I still think it's a bubble and not because it "gains value so quickly." That's a strawman argument as far as I'm concerned.
I think it's a bubble because all value of BTC currently is based on future projection. Investors buy BTC not because of its current value as a cryptocurrency, but because they think it will be worth much more in the future.
Think about it. What is the intrinsic value of 1 BTC? Everybody's prices are fixed in fiat, so BTC isn't at the stage where it has intrinsic value as a currency unit. People don't value goods and services directly in BTC. So currently, BTC has intrinsic value because it is a store of value: you can put $1000 in BTC and have fairly reasonable trust that that amount will either stay the same or grow.
That's circular logic right here. BTC has value because it keeps growing in value, it keeps growing in value because it has perceived value.
Look, as crypto enthusiasts, we all know BTC has intrinsic value as an alternative to fiat as a decentralized currency. But that value is NOT, IMO, what's being reflected in current market movements. What you're currently seeing is people buying BTC because they want to make fiat money off of it, and as long as this perceived value is based on future growth, what you have is a bubble situation.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:34:22
That's the theory, that BTC has a built-in fixed supply. Unfortunately, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are clear examples that there is a method to, to use a fiat term, print more money. The supply can be doubled with a fork.

Ever heard of wire transfers?

How is it a transaction they say you can't make, then?
