i think bitfinex can do wire transfers for larger amounts that you're looking to buy into. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:21:17

@_date: 2017-05-30 01:06:54
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:06:02
so if i trade bitcoins to my nano-s and it is never confirmed and i lose the nano-s does that mean they are gone forever?

ive withdrawn from them like 30 times, but only ~50 ~100 bucks for quick lunch money for the week while im at work. i feel good about being able to withdraw.
