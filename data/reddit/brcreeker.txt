Sorry, but is there a law that states that I must respect a senior family member? Secondly, you do not know either of us. Fact is, my grandmother is a complete cunt, who allowed my mother to be beaten all throughout her childhood, and has treated me like shit my entire life, even into adulthood. So no, I do not think me speaking out against her is a negative check on my character in the slightest.

"...how on earth would I know that my money is safe in Bitcoin?!"
You store the funds outside of a fucking exchange, and on your own privately generated wallet, bitch!  That is the whole point of the goddamned protocol.  It amazes me that "reporters" are not required to spend more than 10 minutes reading a Wikipedia summary before going to air.

Fuck yeah it is.  I had fun with some of the Bitcoin stocks back in the hay days of ASICMiner, but after getting burned a couple times on bullshit like NeoBee, I decided to step away and go back into investing solely into Bitcoin.  I would love the opportunity to invest in an already established company like reddit through a fair system that doesn't simply favor those who have the right connections and stock brokers (ala Facebook, Alibaba, etc).  Hopefully it's a massive success, and it paves the way for other more notable companies looking to go public to do something similar.

BIP0038, bro.  Make two or three copies of your paper wallet.  Insure that you use a strong password that you will remember, and keep them stored in separate locations.  A fireproof safe and a safety deposit box are probably the best ways to keep your phyisical wallets secured.

Today, that way of thinking is perfectly sound, and I even agree with it when looking at it through a current lens.  The only issue though is that we are freakishly close to a future where most low-level and mid-tier jobs will be taken over by automation.  No one really knows how the economy will react to the Automation Revolution, but what many do agree on is that unemployment will likely reach levels that we've never seen in history.  There are many who believe that a Basic Income is an inevitability in the not-too-distant future.

Bingo!  People tend to forget that companies like Amazon and Paypal are ultimately tech companies.  If they need to get something implemented, they either build it themselves or they acquire an already established brand.  If Amazon likes how Bitpay has been setup and implemented, then they will buy them outright as opposed to using them.

I think people are failing to pickup on that last point. There is no question that there is a powerful minority who want nothing more than to see Bitcoin fail. That being said, if the market demands it, it's either do or die. No amount of regulation is going to kill it once the market gets a taste, and there is no way in hell the US is going to let a potential multi-trillion dollar market be completely dominated by China or someone else, American exceptionalism and all that. My guess is that at some point, maybe if we hit $1k or $10k, the government will start stock piling BTC just like they do gold. Also, you can bet your ass that you'll see a few bankers flip allegiance and start sporting the BTC pompoms around that same time.

It probably won't, but it will certainly impact it.  Coinlab was considered by a few market watchers as the second coming: an exchange that was going to set the standard for all others, and was not going to suck.  This may scare a few people into thinking that Silicon Valley's confidence has wained, and that might just be enough to shake out a few more speculators.

I've been holding ActM since the AMC IPO, so I thought I would chime in on this.  Full disclosure, I am still holding a large portion of shares that I started out with, and I've been nibbling up shares all day today.  
As far as the board liquidating all of their shares, I think that it is pure hearsay.  From what I have gathered, the only ones to have allegedly done this is FF69 and Lewicki, and while I am in no way going to accuse them of lying, I will say that I trust them about as much as any other random stranger on the internet.  
FF69 has been incredibly outspoken over the last few days on how he fundamentally disagrees with Ken's marketing strategy, and I think that he was just ready to move on.  From what I managed to gather from him via IRC, he was incredibly frustrated over the fact that he and several others had spent weeks trying to work along side Ken, pro bono, to help build a better company.  What did Ken do as a result?  Nothing.  Ken is your typical engineering type, whose philosophy is, "If you build a good enough product, it will sell itself."  Anyone who has ever worked in marketing knows that this logic could not be further from reality.  FF69 worked fervently towards getting Ken to update his marketing strategy to one that would hopefully lead to much higher sales in the long run, and while Ken apparently acted as if he was willing move in that direction, he stone walled the guys at every turn.
Probably one of the biggest examples of this was with the website. Originally, Lewicki had stepped up to redesign it, and he ended up buying a logo from one of the forum posters, which looked much better than the one that Ken is using currently, and spent weeks building a new site from the ground up (I would post a link, but Lewicki has apparently taken it down). Apparently, the board was preparing to unveil the new site, when Ken stepped up and said that he was not willing to change the site.  Obviously, this was upsetting to the board, and especially Lewicki, since he had spent weeks working on it.  Nonetheless, they all agreed that it was ultimately Ken's decision to make, and they decided to leave it alone: until Ken's web guy started pulling imagery off of Lewicki's site (Logo, Artwork, etc).  This without a doubt infuriated Lewicki, seeing as he had spent his own personal money for the rights to the artwork that was on "his" site, and here was Ken (or whoever does the current site) cherry picking elements for their own use.  I do not know the specifics, but I believe that Lewicki sent Ken a cease and desist, telling him that he could either buy the rights to the artwork, or he could remove the artwork from the site.  Ken chose to do the latter.
Now, given the circumstances, one might wonder why anyone would want to invest in this company.  Well, for one, I would certainly not blame anyone for wanting to sit back and wait until things are a little more clear (production/hashing is slated to begin sometime in November).  I personally am using this opportunity to load up on what I believe to be extremely under-valued shares.  Why?  eASIC.  If you have been following this security, then you should already be familiar with them, but in case you are not, I will give the brief synopsis.  eASIC is one of the most reputable ASIC manufacturing companies on the market, and they have produced for companies such as Fujitsu and Seagate.  These guys are not some mom and pop chip maker, these guys are big time, [and it just so happens that they are the ones who will be producing our chips](  I have very little doubt that when the time comes to start manufacturing 28nm chips, eASIC will be on the forefront and it is likely that VMC is going to be in a prime position; and if I am remembering correctly, Ken already has a few buyers lined up for chips.
It is without question that Ken has his fair share of problems.  My personal opinion is that he is a bit of a control freak, and wants to try to take part in EVERYTHING.  If you have ever worked with anyone like this before, then you would know that their actions typically slow things down and make things much more difficult than what they should be.  That being said, it does not mean that they are incapable of delivering what they say they can.  I truly believe that it is within Ken's best interests to make VMC and subsequently ActiveMining a success.  Whether it is within his capabilities remains to be seen.
I have repeated myself numerous times over the last few months within the various channels that I am in this for the long haul, and that I will not even consider the possibility of selling until we start hashing and the dividends start rolling in.  My advice to anyone looking into investing into this security would be to tread cautiously.  While I do not think that it is a scam, I do think that incompetence can kill any potentially good operation.  The risk is certainly high, but the rewards could be drastically higher in a few short weeks.

@_date: 2013-08-29 22:28:03
I did.  Made them both paper wallets ahead of time and loaded about $10 worth on each.  Gave them the overview (most of which they did not understand), and told them if they ever wanted to buy any, I would bookmark their public key, and they can purchase them through me anytime they want.  My mother called me a week later and said she wanted to buy $100 worth and that my dad was still thinking about it.  Nothing would make me happier than if that $100 investment on her behalf is worth a grand or two in a few years, and they can go on a nice vacation, or better yet, worth a whole lot more in a decade and both could have a nice little nest egg for retirement.  Will it happen?  Who knows?  I'm just glad that I could give them a fair chance at a slice of the pie.
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:05:10
Could be a couple of reasons.  
As thecodyshow mentioned it could mean that we Bit users are becoming more and more mature and understanding that the things are not always going to be hunkydory in the world of Bitcoin.  I've noticed that the price has stayed solid over the last three DDoS attacks, whereas two months ago, it was a simple DDoS that pricked the bubble.  Hands are becoming stronger.
Another possibility is that people are finally getting sick of Mt. Gox's shit, and are buying in so they can start moving their money into another exchange.  This could be really bad if everyone moves their money around and then cashed out at once, so don't be surprised if it goes at high as $140-$150 and then quickly drops down to $100 in a matter of hours.  Again, I'm not saying this will happen, but it's possible.
It could also be that people are buying in anticipation that a few game changers will be announced at the conference this weekend, which I think is the most probable of the three.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:58:55
Your best bet in getting this implemented is to get on the boards (BTCTalk) and make the suggestion to software devs.  Ask them to make mBTC the default with BTC/uBTC/Satoshi(Sats) as secondary options.  
Probably the biggest place to try to get on board for this is Coinbase, since that is where most Americans are acquiring their BTC's at the moment. 
Bitpay is another one, since they are responsible for a huge number of Bitcoin merchant transactions.
Gyft (and any other Digital Gift Card Vendors) is another that would benefit greatly from this decision.
Lastly, and most importantly, we have to get the exchanges on board.
@_date: 2013-05-11 05:57:10
Dude, you totally just explained the fuck out of this! I totally get it now. That being said, if people can pull one over on a couple speculators, thus getting Bitcoin out of greedy hands, and into the hands of people who actually want to see the currency succeed, then more power to them. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:37:10
So do many of us.  I would anticipate that it will be another week or two before they are able to move the funds into another bank and then reopen the ACH withdrawals (assuming that is even the way they decide to distribute the money).  Be patient, and be thankful that we've at least made it to this point.

@_date: 2013-08-26 22:30:55
I completely agree!  At this point, everyone should assume that anything that you store or transmit over the internet is easily intercepted and viewed by prying eyes.  If you are storing anything, regardless of whether it is online or not, that is remotely confidential, it needs to be encrypted. I understand the logic in voting with your dollars, and not supporting companies that conflict with your ideologies, but the sad truth is, most people do not give a shit about their privacy; hence why we are breeding a generation of narcissists who cannot take a shit without tweeting or sharing it on Facebook.  boycotting Dropbox would barely put a scratch in their overall user-base, and at the end of the day, it would go completely unnoticed.  If this community wants to see this currency succeed, then we are going to have to drop the egotistical hipster bullshit, and get with reality.  Bitcoin needs big catches like Dropbox more than they need Bitcoin.

The thing that really upsets me about this whole mess, is that we, the users, were completely blindsided, with zero options.  Had he issued a press release, stating that he would be shutting down trading in 24 hours, and that all USD would virtually be held in limbo for an undetermined amount of time, then I, and many others, could have used the very system that we were invested in to move our money around.  I still believe in BTC, and it's growing potential as both an investment platform and a currency, but something has to be done about the exchanges if we're going to see this thing thrive.
@_date: 2013-08-29 22:31:07
Keep two copies of your paper wallet.  Keep one stored in a safe secure location within your house (fireproof safe would be optimal) and one in as you said, a safety deposit box.  Keep a copy of your public key somewhere so you can add more to it should you feel the need, and then forget about it.

I am really sorry to hear about this.  Your post has been a major eyeopener.  I know it's a little too late at this point, but I would suggest using a different exchange going forward.  I have blatantly refused to use Mt. Gox for reasons such as this.  Their security protocols are fucking atrocious.  I just logged in to my old account (2FA enabled) and created an API key that grants access to EVERYTHING.  That to me just seems fucking ridiculous that they allow access to a feature like that without requiring 2FA.  Seriously, Mt. Gox can go fuck themselves!  I sincerely hope that this will get passed around enough, and that they and other exchanges who have a similar flaw will quickly fix them.  Hope you are able to make your investment back.  Hang in there.

I think you are misunderstanding my point.  I'm sticking with Bitcoin for the long haul.  Whether it's $100, $50, $25 or $1, I'll be buying.  Am I supposed to feel sorry for the people who are losing a vast amount of their investments in Bitcoin?  Sorry, but every single dollar I have put into Bitcoin, I have considered spent, and came to the understanding that I may never get it back.  As far as the companies who were started at the height of the Bitcoin bubble, and are worried about losing "fiat" value, well the only thing I could suggest is that they use services that allow them to swap BTC for USD at the point of sale.  If me wanting to back the winning team makes be greedy, then I am guilty as charged.

The problem with this is satoshi does not roll off the tongue very well (not like Bitcoin). It's a nice gesture, but I think it would confuse people (especially Westerners) who will me wondering what this "Japanese" thing is. If we are going to start using satoshis, we need to adopt a slang term. No one really stops to question why Americans refer to dollars as "bucks" and the Brits refer to pounds as "quid." We start throwing a term like "Sats" around, and newcomers might have an easier time embracing it. 
Edit: Me personally; I think we should skip mBTC and go straight into uBTC. **IF** the uBTC ever reaches parity with the USD, then one sat would equal one cent.

What good is it selling your BTC for fiat ($USD I presume) if you cannot get your money out?  Basically, you are stacking increasingly risky bets on Mt. Gox coming through in the end.  Really think about it for a minute.  Let's say you managed to buy in when the price on Mt. Gox was sub $100.  At this point, you could move your BTC from Gox to another exchange, cash out, and still make a slight profit.  With Gox, that is simply not the case at the moment.  Let's say within the next 24 hours, the price rallies, and all the exchanges (Gox included) see a 10% price increase.  Sure, you could sell on Gox at that very moment, make a decent profit... and then what?  Wait for the price to drop so you can buy back in?  Okay, but what have you gained? At some point, it is likely that Mt. Gox will be insolvent, and the Mt. Gox price will be irrelevant anyways, since you will have to move your BTC over to a new exchange anyways.  To re-elaborate, keep your money out of Mt. Gox.

The way I see it, Bitcoin is a currency made for the internet, by the internet.  If there are no options to quickly acquire BTC by way of the internet, then it is a lost cause.  Also, where in the fuck did you receive the notion that he's using Bitcoins for drugs, or his intention is primarily centered around making a profit?  What I hear is that apollojmr is a sensible human being who appreciates the convenience that the internet can provide.

 Don't get me wrong, I am fully aware that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and the government could very easily influence, or shut down a few US based exchanges if they really wanted to, but "regulate."  Yeah, good luck.

Doesn't mean that they are not ignorant enough to try.  Look at how the RIAA and MPAA have fought tooth and nail, spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to combat piracy, instead of investing that money towards adapting their business models to where they give people what they want, when they want it.  I think that Bitcoin will inevitably win in the end, but it is a bit early to call our current situation a clear victory.

The circlejerk response is, "They can't! Mwahahaha!" But in all reality, it would be very easy for them to require all businesses and employees to register their addresses, and then they could simply monitor activity that is publicly available on the blockchain.  Sure, there are those, that would try to skirt under this by pretending they do not deal in BTC and not registering their addresses, but at some point they would get caught, especially if they trade in their Bits at the end of the year and report their capital gains.  Now if Zerocoin ever becomes a thing, then it could be unenforceable.

I guess the biggest lesson I learned was to be prepared for anything. Secondly, do not trust anyone with money that you are not willing to lose. There was nothing more disheartening than to think I made the right decision to cash out my BTC, and hold onto my fiat for the price to drop to a point I was comfortable buying back in, only to have it swiped right out from underneath me. The price dropped, hit the mark that I had planned on getting back into the game and quickly shot back up; and there I was, with nothing readily available to let me back into the ring.  
@_date: 2013-05-10 20:46:05

I disagree. It might not be easy to get money into an exchange, but Coinbase makes it stupid easy to buy BTC. It takes about 10 minutes to setup an account and buy your coin(s). Sure, there is the 5 day waiting period, but once that is over with and you reach level 2, you get the option to buy instantly.

This is my thought exactly.  Right now, we have no way of knowing what the difficulty level will be in a few months or what the price of BTC will be by then, and the idea of tieing up $300 for something that might not ship for another year seems a little too risky.  I think I may just invest in a few ASICMiner shares.

Mastercoin works similarly to Color Coins in that it allows for people to issue units of value that can be tracked in the Blockchain.  If you do not invest in Bitcoin related assets, then this is certainly not going to interest you.  However, the Bitcoin exchange market is primed for something like this, and it is going to be interesting to see who comes out as the standard bearer.

I've been using Bitcoins for almost a year now and I still do not quite understand how (or why) change and paper wallets work the way they do. My biggest question I guess is whether it is possible to recover the Bitcoins from the change address (I'm guessing no, since that would require access to the private key of the change address). How does the Blockchain determine what address the remaining coins should be sent to? Lastly, are there any proposed changes to the protocol that might prevent what could possibly be a huge problem for Bitcoin?
Just to be clear on the process of spending coins on a paper wallet, this is how it should be done I'm guessing:
Import the private key into your client. 
Generate a new address (optional but recommended)
Send all of the coins to that address. 
From this point, all of the coins should be safely secured within your client and can be spent like normal. Should you want to ever send those coins back to a paper wallet, create a new paper wallet. 
Am I missing anything?

I've been doing a little daytrading with my BTC, and so far I've been doing fairly good at it.  However, the biggest difference I see with what I'm doing vs traditional day trading, is I'm not trying to stack up USD, I'm trying to stack up Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-05-03 00:01:10
I personally think that they are awesome! One of the easiest ways to buy BTC at the moment, and one of the cheapest. Sure, it takes a little longer than the alternative methods, but the fact that I can link and verify my bank account within just a few minutes (something that even Dwolla can't do currently) is simply great. My only issue with them is the 24 rolling limit. I'm really not sure exactly how it works, and it has a tendency to strike at rather inconvenient times. Other than that, I think they are fantastic.

Hoard them if they are given to you for free, but I wouldn't drop several hundred dollars into XRP expecting the price to increase in the same way that Bitcoin did.  A popular analogy is that XRP are sort of like postage stamps.  They're really not intended to be used as a currency or commodity, but if users want to use them as that, then there is nothing stopping them.
Edit:  I'm not sure when or how much the next giveaway will be.  It may be 20,000 again, or it may be 200.  We won't know until they execute it.

Has anyone noticed that there is a bit of a pattern forming?  I know, I know, speculation doesn't mean a damn thing in this market, but hear me out.  So far there have been six "bubbles" form.  The first two were formed at a rather high growth rate followed by a HUGE one for the third (33x).  The last three happened very similarly (3.5x, 3x, 22x).  I'm willing to bet that the return to mean will be somewhere around $15 after all the dust settles from this one, which could be days and or months from now.  I think before the end of the year we'll see another "bubble" that will correct somewhere between $45-$80.  Of course, like 99% of the members on this sub, I am in no way qualified to make such prediction, so feel free to ignore my stupid ass!  I'm just here for the ride, and because I truly believe that BTC is the future.

Have you ever been involved with a SNAD dispute?  I have.  A buyer claimed that I sent him an empty iPad box instead of an iPad, which was complete bullshit.  I went out of my way to provide evidence that the iPad I sold a guy was shipped to him.  Found my shipping receipt that had the original weight, vs the weight of the package he sent back to me (which was significantly less).  Pointed out that the "return" was from a different name and address from the person that I shipped it to.  Pointed out that I was the only party that had a verified Paypal account.  You know what it got me?  Zilch.  Paypal could not have cared less on whether I got my money back.  
Also, your point about emptying out your Paypal account, yeah that didn't matter either, since Paypal withdrew the $400 out of my bank account the moment my Paypal balance went into the red, which happened as soon as the asshole filed the dispute. 
**Seriously, fuck Paypal!**

That is beside the point.  Whether you like them and/or Phillip Defranco, who co-founded their channel, or not; they have a substantial viewer base on YouTube.  To top it off, they focused on a "Silver Lining" Bitcoin story, and did a pretty damned good job of explaining the currency in layman's terms (except for the reward halving every four years bit, but TBH, a lot of people make that mistake).  Considering that it's channels such as this that many younger viewers (south of 25) get caught up with the news, I'd say it is overall positive.

Why?  I would love to see the price of Bitcoin drop back down into the $15-$25 range.  This will really allow me to steadily rake in more coins in preparation for the next potential bubble.

I'd be willing to bet that we'll see it drop below $100 at least once within the next week.  It really doesn't matter though, considering I firmly believe that by the time we enter into another bubble, we'll be seeing growth up into the thousands.  Point being, buy as many as you can afford.  I'm not looking at how much fiat I can stack up while daytrading; I'm looking at how many bitcoins I can get.

One option, though a little risky, would be buying $200 worth of BTC and then moving the funds over to Bitfloor. From there, you can cash back out and then do an ACH withdraw. I seriously would not recommend doing this now since the market is in a constant state of flux, but it's completely up to you. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:13:08
Thanks for the heads up.  Again, this would be more of a reason for someone to step up to the plate and compete directly with Coinbase.  This most recent "bubble" that we went through was huge, but imagine how much bigger it could have gotten if there were more services like Coinbase that made it dead simple to buy in.  There is a growing interest in Bitcoin, but the adoption rate will continue to remain stagnant if there are not more services that allow for people to easily jump in.

I think that if anyone is wandering whether they missed the Bitcoin bus, here is your answer.  While I'm in no way saying that Bill Maher speaks for the general populace, the fact is, he had a panel of three, well educated people sitting across from him, and not a single one piped up towards Bitcoin's defense; which tells me that none of them have a clue how it works (assuming they know anything at all).

It's still a little wonky, but keep in mind that Ripple is still in Beta, so it might be much easier to move funds around once/if it becomes more widely used.  Right now, we're still pretty much stuck with Bitinstant being the quickest way to get cash in hand into an exchange and likewise, into your Ripple account using what's called and IOU.  Let's say that you want to send $100 into your Ripple account that you will use as liquid for BTC investing.  The way that you would do that now is deposit the money into Bitstamp (and soon Kraken) via Bitinstant (or a wire transfer which will take significantly longer).  Once the funds are in your Bitstamp account, you can then withdraw them into your Ripple account.  Why would you want to do this?  Considering that I was one of many that lost a pretty penny in the whole Bitfloor closing scandal, I can honestly say that I do not like keeping much (if anything) directly in an exchange.  Anyways, now you have $100 USD sitting in your Ripple account ready to go, and you want to trade $50 for BTC.  You look on Bitstamp and see the price of BTC is trading at $105 and Kraken is trading at $109. Obviously you would want to initiate the trade over at Bitstamp (unless the exchange rate within the Ripple exchange is less), so you then send the $50 back to your Bitstamp account via Ripple, and then initiate the trade (all of this literally takes less than a minute if you have a decent workflow.  Now, you can either leave your Bitcoins in your Bitstamp account, send them to your Ripple account, or you could take part in a little arbitrage and send the coins over to Kraken (either by sending them to your Kraken BTC wallet directly or by way of Ripple which would probably be the quickest method), and then sell them at $109; giving yourself an almost $2 profit for about five minutes worth of clicking (Note that if you are going to try your hand at arbitrage, then you'd be better off working with the entire $100, but it's whatever suits you).  I think the hope is that one day, banks will begin to use Ripple within their framework, so that in the future you might be able to login to your bank account online and submit a withdraw directly from your bank account into you Ripple wallet.  Here's to hoping.

Keep in mind that there is almost always a depression after a bubble pops.

Bitcoin is not a stock.  Does it follow some of the same patterns? Absolutely, but that still does not mean that we should look at its valuation as if it were a privately held company.  Plus, I would like to know how many times in history a company has gone from ~$3B market cap to a ~$12B marketcap overnight.  I would be willing to bet that there are not many, if any.
Secondly, curing cancer ≠ buying shit off the internet.  Just because ebay might grant people the opportunity to buy and sell things for BTC, does not mean that people will actually do it.  Trust me, I'm not trying to be a Negative Nancy or anything; instead I am just trying to snuff out some of the hyperbole.  I firmly believe that we will see $1K Bitcoin within the next year or two, but I do not think that an announcement from ebay is going to be the force that gets us there.

What are the chances that we'll get it back with interest?  Considering that most of us had USD held within Bitfloor for investment purposes, and since none of us are able to use the funds in the way that we intended for them to be used, I think it's only fair that we are compensated for that.  I know it's highly unlikely, but we didn't give the money to Roman for the purposes of saving it.
@_date: 2013-06-26 04:40:00
Before everyone gets in here and starts circlejerking over Bitcoin's flawless security, and that governments are powerless at shutting down the infrastructure, let me clarify that states are not going after Bitcoin directly, but rather the exchanges. As someone who has had a fair amount of change tied up in Bitfloor for a couple months now, I would warn everyone against keeping a large mount of BTC or fiat in any of the exchanges. If any of these services are shut down, and your money is still in their hands, it is very likely that you might never see it again. My advice: buy in, withdraw your bits into your personal wallet, and either leave it alone or spend it. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 05:12:31
Pull up a seat young one, and let Uncle brcreeker tell you the story of Bitfloor.  Bitfloor was an exchange that was setup and run by Roman Shtylman, and was considered one of the best exchanges around simply because it had a really simple way of depositing USD into your exchange account using a teller system provided by Bank of America.  Shortly after the bubble popped back in April, Roman's bank, Capital One, declared Bitfloor's account as too risky, and decided that Roman could no longer do business with them.  Naturally, they froze all deposits and withdraws on the account, and told Roman that they would issue him a check for the full balance of the account for him to take elsewhere.  Being the slimy cocks that they are, Capital One made this process (which they originally said would take about 10 days) into a one month ordeal.  Meanwhile, as what some could consider a result of Roman's legal council, very little information was being relayed to Bitfloor customers, who were steadily getting more worried that they might never see there funds again.  Shortly thereafter, Roman announced that he had received the check, and then... Silence.  Turns out, when you receive a check from one financial institution for an amount as high as the one that Roman received, others are a little squeamish about accepting you as a customer, especially in knowing that your primary goal is to put that money in so your customers can then take it right back out.  Then one day, a beacon of hope came forward.  This champion on the hill went by the name of AudenX, and she became the unofficial PR rep for Bitfloor.  By continuously calling both Roman and his attorney, she managed to make major headway in getting answers, and settling the nerves of Bitfloor customers.  Eventually she was able to connect Roman and his attorney with the Internet Credit Union, who were sympathetic to the wrongfulness that had been reeked upon us, and let Roman open an account.  As of this very evening, AudenX sent an email out to all Bitfloor users that were subscribed to her mailing list that she had successfully received her funds back.  We can only hope that the remaining customers will receive theirs soon enough.
TL;DR: Capital One decided to be dicks and close down a large exchange's account, leaving their customer's funds in limbo.  Meanwhile, the exchange's owner did a terrible job of keeping customers informed on the state of their funds.  A customer, AudenX, stepped up and rode Roman and his attorney like rented mules until we started getting answers and eventually resolution to the problem.

I hate to say it, but we really need to start looking into lobbying.  I know the typical circlejerk attitude around here is, "Pfft! They can't regulate Bitcoin! Come at me bro!" but the fact remains that someone(s) starting to see the disruptive threat that is Bitcoin and they are going to do whatever it takes to shut it down.  Sure, they cannot disrupt the infrastructure, but they most certainly can disrupt the system.  Let's assume that in six months time, Congress passes a bill that states that it is illegal to own and operate a business within the United States that accepts Bitcoins.  Think about what that will do to the markets.  Coinbase, gone.  CampBX, gone.  The hundreds of stores that have popped up in the last few years that solely work around BTC, poof!  All of the mining securities, no more.  Also, keep in mind that as of this moment there are very few ways for anyone to put USD in and take them out.  Hell, the price drops a good 10%+ every time there is an issue with fiat withdrawals from Mt. Gox.  Now imagine if USD withdrawals become impossible.  Do you really think that the localbitcoins network has enough liquidity to maintain BTC's current market share?  It's time we all put away the hubris and start seeking ways that we can circumvent this dim fate from becoming a reality.  
The first thing that we should try accomplishing is finding someone(s) who we as a community could consider the unofficial spokesperson/spokespeople of Bitcoin.  Whether it is Gavin, the Winklevoss twins, Max Keiser, whoever; we need someone who can take this fight to Washington, and work towards educating Congress on what Bitcoin is and why we feel that we need it.  If their only exposure to Bitcoin is coming from the hands that feed, then I can assure you that their masters will do nothing but exacerbate the situation.  Secondly, we need to all commit to informing our local Representatives of Bitcoin.  If you live in a "conservative" state, and your Rep campaigned on free-market values, then they most certainly should be properly informed, and if they are one of the few taking up an agenda against Bitcoin, then they should be called out for their hypocrisy.

I think you are giving charge backs too much credence for why people pay with credit cards.  **Honest** customers rarely even think of charge backs.  If most people are not happy with their purchase, they can return the item within a fair amount of time in exchange for a full refund, and if the store or service provider is honest, they will give a refund without question.  What is simply not fair for merchants is when customers can fraudulently claim that they received the wrong item (when they didn't), or claim that their card was stolen (when it wasn't) and then get their money back without having to return the merchant's product at the expense of the merchant.

My setup is as follows.  I have a Blockchain.info address with 2FA enabled as well as a secondary password for spending, which I use to keep a total of one BTC.  I also have Mycelium running on my phone and Nexus tablet.  I keep copies of the private keys stored on each, as well as a backup of the private key on my SD card.  I keep a maximum of $200 USD worth of BTC in Mycelium, and I keep the PIN security enabled.  The rest of my BTC are stored on paper wallets and kept it two locations (my safe and a safety deposit box).  I will add BTC to a paper wallet until it reaches one BTC, and then I will create a new one. 
This is the one thing that newcomers really need to understand about Bitcoin.  If your money is stolen, it's gone.  You cannot call up a customer support line and request they put a hold on your account and charge back any unauthorized funds.  Treat large sums of Bitcoin just as you would cash or gold.  You would not leave it lying around, and you certainly would not be carrying it around with you on a day to day basis. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:57:39
Coinbase is not intended to be used as a trading platform though.  If your primary concern is to squeeze every ounce of fiat USD out of your BTC, then obviously CampBX or various other exchange sites are better suited for that.  My point was that Coinbase is far and above the easiest solution for anyone that just wants to dip their toes into BTC regardless of market price.  If you're trying to get someone to adopt bitcoin, is it not easier to suggest they go to a site that they can buy coins directly from funds within their existing bank account, or have them go to an exchange where they'll need to create a separate Dwolla account (which will take a couple days to verify, plus a few more days on top of that to transfer funds into the account, then they'll need to transfer funds from Dwolla to said exchange, then initiate a trade, and finally withdraw coins to their wallet)?

The way I understand it is that all transactions would be pegged to fiat.  So let's say for example that I purchased an Xbox One today for a total of 474.73171 mBTC ($499 USD:Bitstamp), I get it, play with it for a few weeks, and then one day get online to see that the price of Bitcoin has risen to $1500 USD on Bitstamp.  I immediately think, "Shit, if I had held onto my BTC for a few weeks, I would have only had to spend 332.67 mBTC.  Ooh! Amazon has a 30 day return policy!  I'll just send the Xbox back and get my 474.73 mBTC back and then I'll buy another one for less.  brcreeker, you my friend are a genious!"  I submit a return request, box it up and ship it off.  A few days later, I get a notification from my Blockchain.info app that .33267 BTC have been deposited to by account.  Immediately, I think, "What?!  That can't be right!  I paid 474.73 mBTC, why didn't I get it all back?"  Reason being is because the moment I sent my BTC to Amazon, they turned around and converted it to fiat.  Therefore, the only way they can refund me is to return the current market value of the item that I returned.  The only way they could circumvent this is if they held onto the BTC until the end of the return period, but considering that Bitcoin is volatile as shit, there is not a chance in hell they would do this.

No one knows yet.  It's likely that they have developed some new ASIC tech which runs faster on much less power.  No one really knows what the price will do after the announcement.  It could be something groundbreaking, thus causing the price to skyrocket, or it could be completely underwhelming and flutter back down below .001.  I would make a small investment, for me that would be between .1 - .2 BTC and see what happens.
Edit: Full disclosure, I am an AMC investor.

Let me reiterate; anyone who thought that &gt;3% weekly ROI would be sustainable is a complete moron.


Who?  Other than maybe Avalon, there are few who seem to actually be delivering at the moment.  As we have all seen with BFL, anyone can release a press statement, proclaiming that they are going to be kicking ass and taking names in the near future, but few have actually managed to follow through.  Sure, there is no doubt that at some point, more companies will be rolling out ASIC's, but I'm more focused on what's happening now.


Worrying over a near 50% drop in hash rate over a period of one week seems a little short sighted.  If the hashrate continues to drop over the next few weeks, then I would then see a reason to start worrying.  Anyone who is packing up their ball and going home over this simply comes across as weak-handed newb, who probably should not be investing in ASICM anyways. Good riddance.

Or in this case, we had a large percentage of the market tied into one exchange that seems to be held together with two paper clips and a stick of gum.  Most of the people that were buying into this bubble were folks who had probably never invested a dollar in there entire life, and the second they noticed a drop as a result of server-lag, they panicked and bowed the fuck out.  If there's a silver lining to this, the only media outlets that have been reporting on this have been primarily geared towards market watchers.  I think the "Big One" has yet to come.  When my parents start asking me about "Byte Coins" is when I'll know that we're in for the big pop.

Exactly!  This completely defeats the purpose of 2FA if it only keeps someone out of the front end.  It would be relatively easy (and it's most likely what happened in OP's case) for someone to remote into your desktop, and take advantage of a session in which you've already logged in.  Again, it's a major flaw, with a simple solution.

Which is exactly why I don't have the money that I'm willing to invest tied up into a savings account.

I would not count on the price dropping too much.  There might be a sudden flash crash, but I cannot see this news dragging the price below $100.  If you are computer literate enough to use Tor and Bitcoin, then you should be well aware that identical, and possibly better services are already in the pipe.  This market is way too big to just leave on the table.  There is also the possibility that this might be a hoax, which if that is true, the price will shoot right back up.

Seriosusly.  I have lost all respect for Ukyo.  I absolutely hated that BTCT suddenly decided to close up shop, but at least they allowed people to continue trading for a period of time.  This is absolute bullshit, and I have a feeling that Ukyo will be picking up some amazingly cheap shares soon (if he hasn't already).  Well fuck him, he will not be getting any of mine.  I certainly do not want to be a bag holder, but I also want to give the issuers a chance to find a temporary solution.  I'm really hoping that after this last week, the Bitcoin community is starting to wake up and realize that we need more than just a decentralized currency, but we need decentralized markets as well if we are going to keep the con-artists that we Americans call our legislators out of our business.  We need to do what we can to insure that Colored Coins make it out of development.

No I did not, which would explain it.  But this seem like something that should not need enabling, it should be on by default.

[Here, play with this.]( 
Again, all of this is speculative, but the general consensus is that at some point owning and using Bitcoins may be as common as having a paypal account.  Currently, there are about 2 Billion people who use the internet on a regular basis.  Now, let's assume that if 10% of them begin to take interest in Bitcoin five years from now.  The laws of supply and demand will most likely move the price much higher than it is today, simply because there are not enough "whole" Bitcoins to go around.  If there were 18M Bitcoins at that time, and they were distributed equally among all 200M, that would leave .09 BTC per person, which obviously would not be the case.

Good to know. Since I'm doing such small deposits, I might try doing a direct to BTC wallet, just to see how it goes. If it doesn't go through smoothly, I'll go the Mr. Gox route going forward. Does Bitinstant support any other exchanges like Bitstamp or Camp BX? I really dislike Mt. Gox. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:07:38
Okay, here's is the honest to god answer... We don't know.
Assuming that BTC is going to become mainstream within the next five years, then yes, now would be a perfect time to come aboard.  However, it could be the complete opposite five years from now, and just fizzle out and die. I doubt it, but it's possible.  I do think that the days of making a $1,000 investment, which turns into a million dollars within three years are long behind us, but with that said, we may eventually see growth into $10k - $100k per Bit range.  My advice to you, only buy in with an amount that you are willing to lose.

We can learn a lot from Bittorrent.  Here is the approach that I see being the most plausible.
You (and anyone else who wants to use the service) downloads an application to your (their) computer.
In order to access a sellers inventory through the application, you would need a way to link directly to them.  This can be done via cyptographically assigned addresses or a small downloadable file, similar to a torrent file.  
These addresses and or files can then be accessed through various sites around the web, similar to how there are numerous torrent trackers available.  These sites would then have the ability to allow sellers to post their addresses, and buyers could then submit feedback which would either increase or decrease their popularity.
This is a gross oversimplification of how this process might work, but it is one that I could see as an option.
@_date: 2013-07-12 02:53:20
I've been speculating that it's somewhere between $30-50 USD.  Now, I'm a little more optimistic.  I'm going to say $45-70.  I think with all the ASIC's that will be coming online within the next few months, you are going to see a lot of people steadily cashing out there returns in hope to make back their investments quickly.  I could be wrong, and those that are mining may decide to hold, but I doubt it.

I have a number, as do we all, but instead of cashing out it full, I will simply be cashing out my initial investment (assuming we hit that number).  I could probably make a lot more money if I decide to hold, but this would be the safest course of action for me to take I feel.

I personally do not.  I think that we'll see it hit the mid-nineties and maybe even scrape the ceiling of $100, and then it will start to dip back down to the sixties.  I think we are nearing the floor though, which I think is somewhere between $30 and $50.

As of now, it appears that Roman's bank (Capital One most likely) are being incredibly difficult, and are refusing to release the funds, even though they allegedly told him they were mailing him a check weeks ago.  This is most likely the reason that he's lawyered up, and is being cautious about what he says publicly, out of fear that Capital One may delay this process just out of spite.

Correction, they WILL be worthless.  If people give value to them, which at the moment CNC is trading for about 15 cents on BTC-e, then they are certainly worth something to some.  I agree though, most of these altcoins are merely designed to be a quick pump and dump for the devs and early adopters.  Think about it.  You decide to develop and or start mining one of the new ones, get a couple thousand over a few days, and then offload them onto someone for .0001 BTC a piece, you've essentially just earned yourself a quick $20-$30.  Say you mine for a month and manage to rake in about 30K of these things, and then BTC-e decides that it's worth adding to their trading platform.  After a day or two of pumping, they start trading at .0017 BTC, you decide to dump yours, landing yourself about 51 Bitcoins. The thing is though, this is only going to happen so many times, before the majority starts to catch on and they start ignoring these other altcoins.

I have a Nexus 5, and I tested out the BIP38 functionality with the Blockchain.info app, and it took about 30 seconds to decrypt the private key.  Can I expect similar results for Mycelium when it is implemented?  Also, the password that I used to test it out was really weak (Password was TEST), would that make any difference in the decryption time?
Thanks for all the awesome work you guys do.  Your app is by far the most useful thing on my smartphone. 
EDIT:  I just tested it out again with the Blockchain.info app with a MUCH stronger password, and the time to decrypt was still about 30 seconds.  I personally do not mind waiting that long to process a secured transaction.

I'm not suggesting that the 7.5% is unreasonable.  I think that pegging the price to Mt. Gox is.  As of right now, it's extremely difficult to get money out of Mt. Gox, which is the only reason they are higher than all the exchanges.  I would suggest pegging the BTCQuick price to Bitcoinaverage's.  I think they are providing a much truer representation of Bitcoin's FMV, especially if you use the "no-mtgox" portion of their API.

Exactly. Here's the best way I have found. 
Download the source files for bitaddress [here]( 
Snag a copy of Linux. I prefer [Mint](
Create a live USB. 
Disconnect your Ethernet cable and boot into the Linux live USB. 
Open the bitaddress HTML file, select the paper wallet tab and generate as many paper wallets as you want, but check the BIP38 option and type in a strong password that you'll unquestionably remember; then click print. 
What I like to do is print it to a PDF file and save it to my flash drive, and then move it to Google Drive after I reboot and reconnect to the internet. This is purely optional, but I like knowing that I have a digital backup in the cloud in case my physical copies get destroyed or stolen. You could even run an extra layer of encryption over it via True crypt if you are super paranoid. 
Before sending funds to the address(es), it would probably be a good idea to test decrypting the private key to insure everything is right. You can do this currently within bitaddress (in the Wallet Details tab), the Blockchain.info app (Don't import the private key), or you can use [bit2factor]( (I would advise doing this from your Live USB as an extra precaution). You'll soon be able to test/import BIP38 Keys with Mycelium, but it's not implemented yet, and it is apparently a bit straining on older phones as far as decryption time goes. 
Hope this helps anyone who is interested.

Most (not all) people that were buying at the pinnacle were simply riding the hype coaster and are no longer interested at the moment. Will the Bitcoin recover from this?

Nope.  Not true at all.  The smart scammers can do what is called a Significantly Not as Described or SNAD dispute.  What happens here is the buyer receives the item, then contacts ebay and/or paypal and claims that the item they received is not what was listed and subsequently what they paid for.  For example, OP ships the item with tracking, Buyer gets the item, then comes back and says that you sent them a brick.  Paypal's policy pretty much states that if the buyer sends back what they **"received"** within 60 days, they are entitled to a full refund.  Scamming piece of shit ships OP a brick, makes off with OP's jalapeno, and get's their money refunded. 
**TL;DR: Don't fucking use ebay!**

A bubble is nothing more than a spike in interest of a rapidly growing market.  We just saw this happen in March, and we'll most likely see it happen another several times before we see BTC plateau out at it's proper valuation.  I think everyone who's hopping on board now is hoping that lightning will strike twice, and they will see their investments increase by 10000% in four years.  Whether this will happen is completely based on how many people are willing to start using Bitcoin.  I think that it's highly likely that we'll eventually get there, but I don't think that it's going to happen as quickly as it did this last go around.  Then again, we might be seeing Bits trading at $10,000 per coin by the end of 2014; only time will tell.  If in ten years, you can walk into your nearest convenience store, pull out your phone and pay for a fill up using Bitcoins, then I think it's highly likely that modest investments today could be huge investments in the future.  I think that Bitcoin has a long way to go before we get to that point though.

I'm not 100% convinced that Schiff really believes what he says about BTC.  He sounds more like someone who has realized that he's missed another round of opportunity, and is thinking, "Shit...

How so? To calculate the Market Cap of any asset, you multiply the current value by the total number of outstanding shares. For example, the current market cap is $4.9B. That doesn't mean that if EVERYONE decided to sell their coins, they would receive an accumulated $4.9 Billion, it is just the number you get when you multiply the current number of shares (11.9M) times the current market value ($411 BitcoinAvg). 
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:01:15
Does your system allow for tracking numbers to be submitted, so when the package arrives to the buyer, it will automatically update the sellers status to fulfilled? If so, I would agree that five-seven days of no communication is plenty of time from when the buyer receives the goods to release the funds.

I agree, and there's evidence that suggests that Silicon Valley is taking notice. I imagine that you'll see some incredibly sophisticated exchanges towards the end of the year that will completely blow what we currently have out of the water. Coinlab (Mt. Gox 2.0) will probably be the first round of these, but I suspect that the demand is high enough for some even bigger players to jump into the arena. This bubble was bound to pop at any moment, but imagine how high it might have gone if the servers did not lag out for another day or two. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:06:44
Sure, but I would be willing to bet that we'll see it rebound rather quickly.  There's no question that there is going to be some volatility as a result of this news, but the idea that the Bitcoin economy is permanently scarred by this news is ludicrous.  Competing services will emerge, most likely based overseas, and things will move forward.  I think a majority of Bitcoin holders know this, and essentially what is happening now are people trying flip.
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:15:27
I was explaining BTC to a friend over the weekend, and made the gold analogy.  When we came up to the mining aspect, I explained it like this:
Imagine that you are in a room with 100 students, all of which have different skill sets in math.  Your professor walks in and poses an interesting challenge.  He lays ten 1oz gold coins on his desk and writes a complex math problem on the chalkboard.  He then explains to the class that he will present mathematical problems of increasing difficulty to the class, one at a time, and whoever solves the problem first will receive one gold coin.  After ten minutes, a student raises his hand and claims that he has solved the problem.  After verifying that the student has indeed solved it, the professor awards him with a coin and writes the next problem on the board; this one being more difficult than the last.  Another 15 minutes go by and the same student raises his hand again.  After verifying his work, the professor awards him with another coin.  At this point, most of the students begin to realize that this student has an edge over the rest of the class, and a few students begin to group up to solve the problems together, and if they manage to solve it, they will split the coin up based on how much each contributed to solving the equation.  Soon after, one of the groups successfully solves the problem and is awarded the third coin.  The professor then decides that he would like to keep the experiment going longer, and announces to the class that after the fourth coin has been awarded, he will cut the coins in half and only award half of a coin for every problem solved.  He then explains that he will do this each time two full coins have been awarded.  Shortly after another group solves the fourth problem and is awarded the fourth coin, the professor pulls out a hacksaw and cuts the remaining six coins in half.  Many students at this point leave the room, on account of the experiment becoming too time consuming, and go out to tell their friends about this crazy experiment.  At some point, when about half of the original coins have been distributed, the price of gold surges at the markets and the universities newspaper runs an article talking about the experiment.  At this point, hundreds of students from around the campus decide to barge into the classroom to take part in the experiment.  Some of these students are savant's, others have incredibly fast computers that help them solve the problems, but the point is that everyone has a shot at solving the problems the professor is posing.  
Bitcoin is very similar in that like the ten original coins there are a finite 21,000,000 coins, that of which none will ever be issued once all 21,000,000 are mined.  These coins were originally awarded in blocks of 50 to anyone whose computer could solve the problems presented by the blockchain. When a total of 210,000 blocks have been awarded, the reward halves (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5625...). Like the students who grouped together to solve the problems, miners can pool their resources and work together, to give themselves an edge over those who had a natural advantage.  When the savants and computer wielding students came to the experiment, this is roughly the equivalent of GPU and ASIC miners coming online.
There is probably a much easier analogy to the one that I presented, but the trouble that most people have when it comes to Bitcoin is not being able to associate it with a real world asset.  By taking this approach, my friend walked away from the conversation, not only much more enlightened, but actually quite interested in dipping into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I had to back the video up to make sure I didn't just miss the word "child."  What a stupid fucking statement!  Yes, yes, they probably meant to write "Child Pornography" in the prompter, but still.  On the same token, how awesome would it be if all the premium porn sites would start accepting BTC directly?  Think of how many people would jump in, just so they can buy their porn without some conspicuous charge showing up on their credit card.

Did you even bother watching the entire video?  Cenk was not speaking ill will of Bitcoin in the slightest.  If anything, he is expressing a mass amount of disbelief, and to be fair, why shouldn't he?  Bitcoin has essentially rewritten the laws of economics, and I feel like we're just getting started.  His shock and awe is warranted, and you know, that is not necessarily a bad thing.

Seriously, we have over a half-million dollars just in Reddit users who have stepped forward, and no telling how many that have not been tallied.

The next few weeks are going to be interesting to say the least.

I miss Bitfloor too, but I can honestly say that I will never do business with them again, assuming Roman decides to reopen the doors at some point.  I was leery about doing business with them originally, upon learning how they lost several customers Bitcoins, but I gave them the benefit of a doubt, and used them anyways, only to now have the bulk of my reserve fiat that was set aside to buy in when the opportunity was right, locked up in limbo.  Bitfloor had probably the best exchange model, but the company itself just seemed poorly managed.

OP, I really hope that this works out for you, but I just wanted to post this to let everyone know the risks that are taken when selling a high demand item on ebay (copied and pasted from my comment above):
Smart scammers can do what is called a Significantly Not as Described or SNAD dispute. What happens here is the buyer receives the item, then contacts ebay and/or paypal and claims that the item they received is not what was listed and subsequently what they paid for. For example, OP ships the item with tracking, Buyer gets the item, then comes back and says that you sent them a brick. Paypal's policy pretty much states that if the buyer sends back what they **"received"** within 60 days, they are entitled to a full refund.

I'm in the same boat as you. I've decided that I will be spreading fiat around to a couple different exchanges. Right now, I'm using CampBX and Mt Gox, and I've signed up for the Kraken beta. I'm really hoping that I get my money back from Bitfloor, but until it's returned to me in some form or fashion, I'm considering it gone. This whole experience has taught me a few incredibly valuable lessons that I plan to take with me going forward.

That is why it is never a good idea to cash out more that 75% of your holdings.  Imagine if this guy had retained 25%.  He would have walked away with nearly $13K in short term profit, and if he held until $100, he could have made nearly a half a million dollars.  Still, there is no such thing as bad profit.

No, everyone on Reddit wants one but can't get them. To put it simply, ASIC's can crank out an enormous amount of Mh/s on very little power (USB in most cases). However, the main company that has been pitching ASIC's for quite some time is Butterflylabs, who have been accepting preorders for quite some time and have been pushing the ETA back by two weeks for months. Whenever they do hit the market though, it's going to definitely be a game changer.

I've been following the AMC story for awhile now, and I think it's possible that Ken has learned some valuable lessons through this experience.  The first offering WAS incredibly complicated, and the only person that it really benefited was Ken (or his manufacturing company VMC).  This new offering is structured very similarly to that of ASICMiner's; the company Active Mining will hold 15M shares (or 60%) and the public will have the option to hold 10M (or 40%).  Active Mining will create and sell chips and mining rigs.  They are also mining as well, which currently is at a modest 445GH/s, but that number will likely increase if all goes well.  Also, Active Mining cannot issue anymore shares unless a majority of shareholders agree via a vote.  While I understand where the naysayers are coming from, I would consider it extremely foolish to consider them DOA before they have had a chance to prove themselves.  Who knows, you might be passing on the next ASICM before it is all said and done.  Just always follow the number one rule of investing: **Never invest more than you are willing to lose.**  Best of luck to those who are investing into this.
Full disclosure: I am invested in AMC and soon to be AM.

I pre-canned this:
Mr. Paul,
Thank you for doing this AMA.  My question for you is in regards to [Bitcoin](
Bitcoin is a growing internet based, decentralized and deflationary currency that allows users to transfer money to and from anywhere in the world.  Bitcoin, at its very core, is a progeny of the free market, and while it does transcend the political spectrum; those who share Libertarian values seem to make-up the majority of Bitcoin users at this moment.  There are many of us who would love to have the option of subscribing to your channel, and use Bitcoin as our payment method of choice.  Would you ever consider having your web developers implement Bitcoin payments into your site?
There are a few services, such as [Bitpay]( that make the process of accepting Bitcoin incredibly easy, and they can even instantly convert the funds into USD should you decide that you do not want to hold Bitcoin yourself.
Thanks for you time, and I look forward to seeing what comes out of the Ron Paul Channel.

I think the only way that I would want to be paid in Bitcoin at this time is if I were in business for myself (which I am and I do) and I was receiving payment directly from the customer.  I do not have employees working for me, but if I did, I would rather pay them via fiat, and offer them the option of putting a percentage of the checks in BTC.  We'll eventually get there, but saying that this is something that Bitcoin "needs" now, seems a little premature.

Huebris is never really a good think to bring to daytrading.  That being said, the ones who were jumping ship SHOULD feel bad.  This is almost identical to what happened last week, where it dropped under 2.35, and quickly rebounded and stayed around ~2.9.  What this tells me is that someone(s) really high up knows what the fuck they're doing, and meanwhile, you have a ton of newbs flocking in on a daily basis making them rich.  It's comical if you really think about it.

Bullshit.  There is nothing wrong with using online wallets.  Sure, you do not want to keep your life savings in them, but for holding a modest amount (dollar amount what I would consider holding in a physical wallet that I carry with me), there is absolutely nothing wrong with using them.  You hear these stories all the time, and 99.9% of the time, the victims are just like this person, and were not using 2FA, or they were holding their money in an exchange service and their API keys were compromised.  
Use 2FA, logout of your accounts when you are finished using them, and don't store an obscene amount on there, and you'll be fine.

Again, *"[t]his is a gross oversimplification of how this process might work."*  I'm sure there are people who are much smarter than I am who could figure out solutions to the problem that you presented.  The fact is that markets that run via illicit means need to be as decentralized as possible. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:54:00
I would have to agree with you, yet I'm still keeping fiat on hand for if it does start to dip again. Fortunately, I think we might be out of the rut of technical glitches manipulating the markets. Things held together incredibly well last night during the DDoS, which tells me that either the weak hands have all been shaken out, or they've become a little more educated on how this market works. I honestly believe that BTC is incredibly undervalued, and I imagine that we'll see another bubble or two before we reach a more true valuation. I won't be cashing out until my parents start calling me to ask about "Bytecoins," and I hope that by then, I won't need to.

Depends on the market cap.  Assuming that in three years, there are 15 million coins in circulation, a $10,000 BTC would mean that Bitcoin has reached a market cap of $150 Billion USD.  I want you to look up Google, Facebook and Apple's market caps and tell me if you think that $150B is within the realm of possibility for Bitcoin.

Every company at some point is a no-name startup company.  Would I be investing half of my holdings into this company?  Hell no, but there's nothing wrong with throwing a little bit in to see what happens.  I put .25 BTC in when it was at .0007, and already cashed out my initial investment.  Where it goes from here makes no matter to me, but if there's even the slightest chance that we could be looking at the next ASICMiner here, I'm going to be holding.  None are these securities (ASICM included) are by any stretch of the imagination stable and low-risk.  If you're content with holding your coins, then do so. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 03:13:40
LOL! I think you meant to say manipulate the market to where it's nearly worthless. The only way that they could "shut it down" is to shutdown the entire Internet.  I think that if they were going to begin an all out assault on Bitcoin,  you would either see interest spike,  thus more people trying to buy in, or you would see people swap their Bitcoins in for something like Litecoins.  One way or another,  cryptocurrency is here to stay!

I could be wrong, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of a doubt, which is why I bought .1 from them.  I'll be reporting back later to let everyone know if the transaction went through or not.

Bitcoin Average would still be a better option IMO. I don't know if you can get CAD out of Gox, but considering the disparity between them, Carvitex and Local Bitcoins, I would say that it is.

Don't forget that there's typically a depression post bubble. It certainly would not hurt to put in a few buy orders under $1 just in case it does get there. Will it happen? Probably not, but it doesn't hurt to be prepared in the instance that it does.

Wrong again Bob.
Bitcoinstore is not using Mt. Gox Price.
Bitmit lets you choose which exchange rate you want.
[Bitpay]( which is the service that many online vendors use are not going by the Gox price.
[Coinbase]( isn't either.

Which is why hardly anyone that I know who has an interest in Ripple actually is invested in it.  Most of the people who have been holding a crazy amount are the people who received them in the last giveaway, where tons of people ended up with somewhere like 20,000 a piece.  That being said, if someone is offloading their ripples that they received for free for a few Bits, then more power to them.
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:52:37
To be fair, no one on r/Bitcoin knew when Counbase was going to make this announcement. I imagine that we're not totally out of this downward slope just yet, but I would cautiously suggest that Coinbase may have just risen the floor a bit. We as a community have been saying for quite a while that Bitcoins need to be easier to buy, and I believe Coinbase just delivered.

Ripple is certainly not a scam. Is it confusing as all hell? Absolutely. But a scam... No. To put it simply, Ripple is an open source payment network that anyone can be a part of. As far as how it works, it's all about establishing trust pathways between users and gateways (the places you can withdraw funds). Ripple also has its own currency that is known as XRP. XRP serves a couple purposes, but its main goal IMHO is to mitigate spam, since every transaction destroys a small amount of the user's XRP. 
The reason so many people are quick to call it a scam is because it was originally created my a private organization known as Open Coin who are currently acting as central issuers of "premined" XRP. While this is probably not the best approach, the fact is that it is the way they chose to do it, and if anyone has an issue with it, they are more than welcome to create their own fork and change how the protocol works. 
Could Ripple play a large and important roll in the near future? Possibly. Do I think that XRP holders are going to be incredibly rich in a few short years? No.

Could not agree more.  Really, I think the key here is that legitimate companies should not have to offer escrow for their services, assuming they have a fair and easily accessible refund/return policy.  In the case of mining hardware, I can see where this might be a problem, but for other types of products and services, it should not be a problem.  But this, "We do not offer refunds. All sales are final." bullshit needs to be done away with, assuming you are a "big" player.

Exactly! It's not that I do not want to have faith in them to pull through for us, it's just that the sheer lack of communication over the last several days has been inexcusable. Here's a few things they could do:
1 Establish a Roadmap; tell the customers exactly how they plan to return their money once the get it (ACH, Mail, Bitcoin, etc). 
2 Daily. Fucking. Updates! Waiting 11 days and delivering a half assed response such as the one we received tonight is completely uncalled for.

@_date: 2013-05-03 02:20:59


You most certainly can fund an exchange directly with Bitinstant... That's how I bought my very first Bitcoin.


Dwolla is a funding source, not an actual way to buy bitcoins.  In order to use Dwolla to buy BTC, you would fund your Dwolla account, and then transfer those funds to an exchange that uses Dwolla as a funding source (CampBX).


CampBX and Dwolla are in no way, shape or form similar.  One is a funding source, the other is an exchange.  In order to fund your CampBX account, you either need to send USD via Dwolla, submit a Money Order, or mail them a personal check.  If you're already setup with Dwolla, and have funds readily available, then Dwolla would be the quickest option.  If you're not, then it would probably be quicker to do one of the other two.
Lastly, you missed Coinbase, which if OP is simply wanting to buy BTC, and is not concerned with dumping them in about three hours, then this would certainly be the easiest way to go.  Signup, link a bank account, verify said account (takes about three minutes), buy BTC.  Literally took less than ten minutes the first time I used them.  It takes about four days for your coins to show up, but you are locked into the price that you agreed to purchase them at.

Good.  This will lead more (if not all) of the service providers to begin accepting Bitcoin, and assuming that they all send out mass market emails to their customers suggesting that because of the Credit Card companies unwillingness to work with them, they will now be accepting Bitcoins as an alternative; which one can hope will lead more people into using the currency.

Easy.  China has now acknowledged Bitcoin as a commodity.  A more damaging headline would have been: "China Bans Use of all Bitcoins; Threatens Imprisonment to Anyone Found Trading or Accepting Bitcoin as Currency."  Instead, we basically got, "Okay banks, this is an incredibly risky bet, and you guys cannot go anywhere near it for the time being.  However, if private individuals wan't to build up their own personal reserves, then they have the right to do so."
I firmly believe that the Chinese government has a huge interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed in the long run, and that nothing would make them happier that a new reserve currency coming to fruition that does not start with the letters US.  People are currently panicking for the sake of panicking.  Give it a day or two.

This is probably your best bet if you're looking to increase the amount of BTC you have on hand.  Take what you were willing to invest in a mining rig, and buy ASICMiner shares.  You'll get paid weekly dividends, and it's likely as more people become privy to the passthrough fund, the amount of BTC per share could increase exponentially.

Trust me, the 356 people subscribed to know what the share price is.  Meanwhile, there are still a huge number of people on who still do not know about ASICMiner or how to invest, which is why in nearly every one of these threads there is always a few people asking how to buy shares.

Square has offered and will continue to offer a 2.75% flat swipe rate. For a little over a year now, they have offered an optional $275/month rate that if opted into would grant merchants 0% swipe rates. A little quick math shows that a merchant would need to do over $10,000/month in credit card transactions for this to net them any savings. If they do less than $10k, they are actually losing money. Considering that the majority of square users are individuals, I would imagine that very few were doing $10k/month in CC processing, and if you were doing that kind of volume, you are probably going with a much cheaper POS provider.

HAHA!  I had the same thought when I read it.  I had to google it to see what exactly Bitmint was.   [Was this site coded in 1995?](  LOL!
**EDIT:**  Decided to dig into the site a little, and found this gem:
	
**What is the difference between Bitcoin and BitMint?**
Bitcoin and BitMint are both digital money solutions. However Bitcoin defies the US dollar and other fiat currencies, striving to offer to the world a non-centralized new money that no nation can control, no central bank can deflate, and no minority can take it over. BitMint, by contrast, simply offers a digital expression of the grand old US dollar (or any other currency or valuable). BitMint is subject to central bank regulations, and abides by all monetary laws and restrictions. **Bitcoin relies on erosive cryptographic intractability -- meaning that eventually it would be compromised.** BitMint relies on equivocation and is immunized against faster computers, quantum computing, and mathematical fault lines.

By the time that everyone considers mining a safe investment, it will no longer be a "profitable" one.  Treat it like any other investment.  Do your research, and don't invest more than you are willing to lose.  At the moment, I am not invested in personal mining, but rather companies that sell the mining rigs.  ASICMiner has been a relatively good bet up until recently, but now with direct competition making it's way into the market, we'll have to wait and see if they can keep their title.  As far as investments, I would advise looking into AsicMiner, Active Mining and Labcoin.  If you think that you want to take the risk purchasing a mining rig, then KNC would probably be the way to go.  I would not go near Butterfly Labs.

Wallet apps (except for Blockchain) are not there. Coinbase was on there for about two weeks and they pulled it. I thought that they pulled the Blockchain one off there as well, but I guess they let it back on. Still, Android is not limited to any of that shit. If you want a particular wallet, you still maintain the ability to put it on your phone regardless of whether Google allows it in the Playstore. I'm not debating whether Android is better than iOS, but I am suggesting with much confidence that the Android platform is much more welcoming for BTC software devs and users.

Mastercoins and Color Coins should really not be looked at as "currency" but rather a means to declare and show ownership of something.  If I wanted to start a company, and I needed to raise funding, I could issue say 1,000,000 Color Coins, each coin representing one share of ownership (a stock essentially) of my company.  I could then list 450K of those coins (45%) for sale in the form of an IPO for a price that I believe is the current or potential market value of my company (say .0001 BTC each).  In the IPO, I put forward the agreement that once my company is profitable, I will pay out 100% profits earned to each share in the form of a dividend payment.  Investors trust that I have a good idea, and see that it is potentially a good investment, and buy up all the shares that I listed.  At that point, each shareholder owns a stake in my company, in which they can cash out at any time.
Originally, Stocks were only exchanged at online venues such as Bitfunder, Havelock or BTC-TC, and while it was a nice system, because it was centralized, it made it incredibly easy for someone like the SEC to come in and say, "You've not gone through the proper channels to register this exchange.  Shut it down, or we are going to fine you into oblivion!  'Murica!"  With protocols like Mastercoin and Color Coins, we do not need centralized exchanges to invest and trade assets.  Instead, we can now do it directly.  It's just another reason why Bitcoin is so much more superior than fiat.

I don't see what the seller would be able to dispute.  That he did not receive the money?  That would be handled on NASHX side.
Let's say for example:
I want to sell an iPad for 5 BTC (~$500 USD).
I risk 5 BTC to NASHX.
A buyer wants to buy the product and risk 10 BTC to purchase it.
I send the item to the buyer with tracking.
Buyer then declares that I sent them an empty iPad box (which I know is not true).
If the dispute is not settled, I have lost both my iPad and 5 BTC and the buyer paid twice what they should have.
If both parties are honest, everyone wins.  If either party is dishonest, nobody wins.

I still do not think that I personally would do that, but I think that it would be relatively safe if you created a secure note within Lastpass and safeguarded the vault with a strong password and 2FA (Yubikey would be my preference).

To be honest, I do not store any BTC on any of the exchanges, other than the services where I'm investing in Bitcoin companies like ASICMiner.  There are plenty of Bitcoin/Fiat exchanges out there though that I believe are far superior to Mt. Gox.  Bitstamp and CampBX are probably the most popular alternatives, and I prefer Bitstamp of the two.  A lot of people use BTC-e, but I would stay far way from them.  For one, they do not offer a legitimate form of 2FA such as Google Authenticator or Authy.  Instead, they send confirmation logs to your inbox to verify any outgoing transactions.  It's better than nothing, but if your email is compromised along with your BTC-e account, you're screwed.

Who said I was surprised about coinbase not using Gox? To your point on selling based on the Gox price, that is the stupidest fucking thing I think I have read in this entire thread.

I would love a more in depth explanation on this.  Forgive me for being a little skeptical, but I have yet to hear from anyone who has used you guys, that had their prices locked in.  Also, no offense, but your fees are simply too high.  To test this out, I just setup a $20 deposit directly into my blockchain account through Bitinstant, and after all the fees are tacked on, it would cost me $23.95 to receive approximately $19 worth of BTC, and that's assuming I do not check the "Make Private" option.

I'd say they are about as easy as Mt. Gox and Bitstamp.  Plus, they are supporting Ripple, similar to Bitstamp, which after using it a few times, I can say it's by far my favorite method for moving BTC or USD in and out of an exchange.
@_date: 2013-08-28 04:34:12
How many BTC do you plan on storing on there?  I'm seriously thinking about getting one, but I'm a little hesitant knowing that I did not generate the Private Key myself.
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:47:58
So essentially,  if it takes me an hour to get to the nearest Moneygram location, and during that hour, the price of BTC shoots up by $5, then I'm getting significantly less that what I originally thought I would be.  Also, you mentioned that the price is locked when you receive the order.  This then begs the question of when exactly do you receive it from the time I drop off my cash? If something glitches up on your end, and the order is not "received" for two or three days, then I am basically throwing a dart blindfolded at what price I will get.  
Trust me, I am in no way trying to belittle you guys.  I think that for some, you are providing an excellent service, but it needs to improve and evolve if Bitcoin as a whole is going to continue to thrive.  I think something that would really tip the scales in your favor, for me anyways, is if you did in fact offer a hard quote that was good for 12-24 hours.  If I'm told that I'm going to get $19 worth of BTC in the front end, and I drop off my cash within that 12-24 time frame, then I get $19 worth of BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:09:03
That's actually not a bad idea.  That being said, you're still looking at ~6 months before breaking even on your initial investment.  If I was going to drop .99 BTC on anything, with the hope of making money on top of my original investment, it would either be ASICMiner shares, or one of the smaller ones like AMC.  Right now, .99 BTC would buy you about 28 shares of TAT.ASICM which on dividends alone could potentially net you around .2 - .3 BTC in a years time, and that's not factoring in the price-per-share potentially increasing (which it very well could not).  Sure, when you play stocks, you're taking a risk at losing it all, but at least you have a chance of making your money back.  With these USB miners at their current price, you're only going to lose.
@_date: 2013-08-18 05:54:44
Wait, are you insinuating that people should not use this tactic against BFL???
Don't get me wrong, I hate how chargebacks have become a breeding ground for scammers to get shit for free.  That being said, BFL chose to allow payments in Paypal, thus agreeing to the ToS.  Then, they proceeded to lie to customers time and time again, claiming that they would be shipping within "two weeks."  If BFL wanted to raise money to build their devices they should have either (A) crowdfunded it through Kickstarter or something else or (B) offered and IPO through one of the many exchanges.  Instead, the mislead their customers for months as they were doing god knows what with their money. 
I have no sympathy for BFL in the slightest.  They are a horrible company, and I hope that this will drive the last nail into their coffin.  Fuck 'em!
@_date: 2013-06-30 04:14:09
Exactly!  I am sick of these people trying to make this point.  I would hope that a majority of people that are dropping money into companies like ASICminer are BTC long-haulers and not just speculators trying to make a quick buck.  But since this point keeps being made that we are now at a sub $100 exchange rate, what is there to say that by the end of this year or mid next year, the price doesn't rise back up to $150 or even $200?  To me, it really makes no difference, because I do not intend cashing out any of my coins until we enter into the next bubble, and I'll only be doing that in hopes that there will be another epic crash and I can pick up the pieces from future weak hands.

This x1,000.
OP should definitely spread that money around to a few different wallets.  If it were me, this it what I would do:
90% ($45,000 worth) goes into Paper Wallets (no more than $10K on each).  I would then make two copies of each of them and store them in separate and secure place (fireproof safe, safety deposit box would be the way I'd go).
5% ($2,500 worth) would go into a few different Local or Online wallets.  ($1,250 in Blockchain and another $1,250 in Electrum).  I would use this to buy things when the price surges, or day trade with them during volatile times.
5% ($2,500 worth) would go into a few different BTC securities: ASICMiner, ActiveMining, ADDICTION, etc.  This way, I would have a chance to further increase my holdings overtime.

I think that this could automatically be built into the protocol or application that will be used for trading.  I think with enough development, this would not be a problem at all.


This could be a major problem, and it is one that I hope the devs are looking towards addressing.  Then again, there was literally nothing stopping people from creating multiple BTCT or BF accounts and doing what you described, so I don't think this would be a major problem.
Bitcoin itself is risky.  This would eventually pave the way for services that apply "credit" ratings to issuers and what have you.  I think at the end of the day, this will lead to better innovation in the space.


The problems you mentioned have never stopped Bittorrent from being a massive success for file sharers.  Yes, you might scare off a few "legitimate" businesses by operating outside of regulations hands... But then again, that is sort of what we are all about if you think about it.  
Point is, a decentralized securities market backed by a decentralized currency is practically unstoppable, unless the various world governments are going to go after issuers directly and serve them with prison sentences (which could be a reality, the way shit is handled these days).  Then again, all this would do is drive the innovation elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-07-03 17:06:01
At no point has Bitcoin ever "Died."  As long as there are people who are willing to invest in it and buy and sell products using it, then it will be around.  Bitcoin, while it has achieved a fair amount of notoriety in the last few months, it still has not reached its full potential for market penetration.  I would guess that less than 20% of the US has ever even heard of bitcoin, and out of that percentage, and even smaller number have taken the time to read up and invest in it.  When Bitcoin becomes your typical watercooler conversation, then I'll have a feeling that we're nearing a proper valuation. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:44:06
Err... So far we have had a number of instances of premature panic at $300, $500, $700 and now $1k+. Not saying you are wrong, it's just that it's just as likely we'll wake up on Tuesday with the price nearing $1600. When everyone is panicking, that's when you should be buying. Fundamentals are key. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 05:47:03
Oh my sweet summer child, this is only the beginning.  All this (along with the SR raid) did was give a nice shot of reality to the BTC community. We are steadily understanding that the economy that is surrounding our decentralized currency needs to also be decentralized in and of itself (at least in the grey areas of the market).  Color Coins will solve most of these problems.

Diamonds are a perfect example of this. People spend a shitload on diamonds every year, and yet they serve very little purpose from a utility standpoint, and the few things that use diamonds for utility (drill bits, saw blades, etc) are made from lab grown diamonds or cubic zirconia. Diamonds are not an investment, and anyone that tells you that they are are full of shit. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 16:33:05
I think the best approach would be:
Bob wants to buy an item for 1 BTC from Alice.
Alice sends 1 BTC to NASHX plus tracking information.
Bob send 2 BTC to NASHX.
Bob receives the package and has ten days to dispute the claim before both his and Alice's funds are released, or if he is happy with his purchase, he can declare the transaction complete, thus releasing in 1 BTC back to him and Alice's 2 BTC's to her.
If Bob wants to be dishonest, and tries to open a false dispute against Alice, she can appeal which would then allow 10 days for Bob and Alice to work things out or for Bob to close the dispute.  If Bob does not come forward, then he is risking paying twice for the item.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:26:36
Now if only he could trade in his Karma for BTC... I have a terrible idea brewing in me head. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:58:24
Assuming the price was hovering around $920 when they decided that they were going to start using it, then yes a jump to $1K would be plausible.  If you are assuming that it would go from $250 to $1K overnight... Well... That is just mental, and it would correct just as quickly as it rose.
I would imagine that what will likely happen first is Paypal will introduce a Coinbase/Bitpay competitor which would enable people the ability to instantly buy BTC with their PP accounts.  Then we might see ebay implementation.  I would not hold your breath for this to happen anytime soon.  Companies like Paypal are waiting to see how governments respond to BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:53:35
I'm thinking this might be a hoax.
@_date: 2013-08-22 16:52:23
I'm sorry, but that is one of the stupidest things I have ever read.  One, I am not suggesting that Ron Paul becomes the official spokesperson.  My main point was that he is creating a predominantly Libertarian, online, "news" channel that currently does not accept BTC as a form of payment, and it would be nice for those of us who actually want to spend some of our coins.  


Err... So does a majority of the country if latest polls are to be believed.


Yes, because someone who convinced about 6% of voters to vote for him to become their next commander-in-chief is really going to cripple Bitcoin if he decides he likes it.  Bitcoin has enough potential problems that it will soon be facing, but Ron Paul is not one of them.

This is exactly why I am going to be keeping my eye out for future IPO's.  How many times have we said to ourselves, "Shit!  If only I bought Microsoft/Apple/Google stock back when it was cheap...?"

The fact that Ken IS taking the communities advice to look towards Colored Coins as a long term solution is very exciting. I'm sure some people won't be too excited about the trading not being available, but if you are long in ActM, this should not be a problem. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:04:59
This seems like it could/should be a simple fix.  Why can't the exchanges leave it up to the users?  I'm not an engineer, but I imagine that it would be relatively simple to implement a display preference into a users account setting, and the default display preference will gradually change over time for new users.  Let's assume I'm heavily invested into BTC (100+) and I have a few acquaintances wanting to jump in at $50 each.  They sign up for an exchange account, transfer their money in, make a $50 purchase, and now they have a little icon showing that they have ~500 mBTC.  Considering that I'm a legacy user, and have a fair share already invested into bitcoin, I probably would want to continue watching the market based on the USD/BTC price, but if I wanted to I could easily switch it to USD/mBTC.  
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:27:19
First comment made me lawl.
"Not really, Most economists agree that it's just another commodity that won't replace money."
Sure, there is a chance that Bitcoin will one day just fizzle out and die, or as the poster was suggesting, be nothing more than a virtual commodity, but citing "economists" is rather stupid at this point.  Economists do not have a good track record when it comes to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:03:21
I would be very careful storing money in an exchange.  I was one of the few who was holding fiat in Bitfloor after the last bubble popped, waiting to buy in.  Bitfloor had it's accounts frozen by Capital One and users such as myself were stuck with our money in limbo for months.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:43:58
Assuming we get another bubble like this last one sometime in the next year or two, we'll be well over [$1000/BTC](  Lets just hope that BTC functions more like a currency rather than a commodity by the time we get there.

Needless to say, I took this opprotunity to fully cash out on my initial investment.  That may turn out to be incredibly foolish after tomorrow, but if it does happen to tank, I am not out on anything.  I will say though, that if whatever they have to announce makes it to the front page or you can anticipate a massive surge in price.  Everyone who was a little late for the ASICM boat will take the opprotunity to climb aboard this one.
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:03:05

As someone who said bye to Mt. Gox months ago, I agree with this wholeheartedly.  Of course, here lately I have been storing coins in my wallet and investing on Havelock and Bitfunder, and so far I've made much more than I ever did with day trading.  The best advice I can give, is keep your money out of the exchanges.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:35:41
I just checked the site.  With a 1 BTC price point, I cannot see myself picking this up anytime soon.  I can print a paper wallet on my own for much cheaper, or I could invest a little more and get a Piper, which I could use to print up paper wallets without the hassle.  However, if it gets down to say the $25 range, I can certainly see myself picking one of these up.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:32:58
I doubled my investment from .25 to .5 BTC on the partial shares today before hearing this news.  Glad that I did.  I have a feeling that this is going take off tremendously.  If I can turn my .5 BTC into one whole bitcoin within six months between dividends and exchange rate, I will consider this a small success. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 06:00:19
This is another reason why people should use an Escrow service when purchasing online with BTC.  The courteous thing for BFL to have done would have been, using one themselves, and putting in the terms that if the item did not ship within "two weeks/months/years" then the customer would be entitled to cancel the order and receive their BTC's back.  Word of advice, never Pre-order anything with BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:24:28
Actually, if OP successfully has the coins in his wallet and they have received a few verifications, there really isn't anyway for the seller to scam him.  What would likely happen is OP could instigate a scam by filing a chargeback against the seller.

Sad but true. Also, with regulation comes inevitable corruption and gaming of the system.  I strongly feel that we are in the early stages of what might end up being a $200B market, and that a good percentage of us posting in this very thread will have a fair amount of success in the coming years from our slight investments, but we are not going to get there until we get the stamp of approval from the world powerhouses and the existing financial systems that we are competing with.  In short, Bitcoin needs "the Man" more than "the Man" needs Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:48:30
May be a good opportunity to try and recruit someone.  Ask one of your co-workers that you're friends with if they've heard of bitcoin. Run through the basics and see if they are interested, and if they are help them set up a wallet.  Then offer them a really good deal.  If you need $20, give them $25-$30 worth of Bits to get them started.  Good luck.
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:45:12
Not to be a dick, but what's to say that you're not keeping photocopies of these for yourself (which if you are emailing these to people, then you are most certainly keeping a copy in your sent folder), and then withdrawing the funds once someone loads them up?  Again, I'm not accusing you of anything, but this comes across as being really shady, and makes it look like you are setting people up to scam them.

In other words, now might be a good time to start spreading your fiat around to other exchanges.
