where/when ?

All I'm saying is that the growth rate is too high, way to high to be healthy. The evolution of the price is too important to not see that something wrong.
It is going to crash one way or another. I don't know how much I don't know how but it is a fact.
Nevertheless in a long term Bitcoin is an amazing investment.

Gemini is not available on my country. 
Coinbase doesn't accept my card
On Localcoin is going to be hard to sell. 
Am I fucked?

For fuck sake 2 days ago, when bitcoin was 1340eu i tried to buy some but i dont know why Coinbase wasn't able to "charge" my card ! Now it's 1511euros !
