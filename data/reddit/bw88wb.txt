Woz is at the forefront of technological innovation. He gets “it”.

Well done, well done :)

I agree with you. Too much shilling in these forums...
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:32:29
Yeah. This is a great observation. Salary provides a channel of expense for companies to spend their Bitcoin revenue.

I am a sub on both r/bitcoin and r/btc. The amount of cross bashing is sometimes pretty funny to watch... :P

If you go to the Twitter account, literally EVERY SINGLE tweet is about crypto.
What have these guys gotten into...
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:37:25
How else can we feel superior?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:52:47
Thanks for your generosity 
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:08:24
Holy smokes... my hands would be shaking just constructing that transaction. One small wrong click and $400m can go "poooof".

I mean come on, market can trade side-ways. Who says it's normal for an asset to go up 10x every year?
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:10:47
Keep up the good work and you will be successful one day. Really impressed with what you’ve achieved as a 16 year old!

If I wanted to create a new BTC/LTC/Altcoin ASIC chip that can break Bitmain's near monopoly of the market, would you be interested in supporting my cause?
Bitmain's domination in mining space right now goes entirely against the philosophies of Bitcoin.

Rest in peace man. Hope you'll be alright.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:31:33
Yeap, this
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:59:08
What a journey guys!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:16:04
Well let's say things can change. I am very bullish on crypto, but nothing stays the same forever. There is a lot of similarities between crypto today and tech bubble in 2000.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:16:26
17000x return woooo
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:57:23
Another milestone

Nice meme ;)

Thank you Pine. You are a good man that the community needs.
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:43:41
It's terrible to see things like this happening to people in crypto.
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:58:02
Nobody knows what they are doing. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:29:34
A lot of people underestimate the difficulty of selling old miners. Hell, even finding a buyer for 100 second hand miners is not easy in this market. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:23:47
In all honesty, Bitmain has been fairly good with their delivery date promises. This was true even during the crazier times around Dec 2017. I distinctly remember them delivering the S9s on time as promised in the order invoice.
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:04:22
The concept is a bit gimmicky, but very cool nonetheless. I wouldn’t want to spend my btc at current prices though.

If your friend is worth $100m, then obviously this is peanuts to him. It's more like "asset allocation" in his view. $200k is still a lot of money to most ordinary folks.
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:56:08
There are better platforms to trade Bitcoin futures than Bakkt. 2019 will be all about crypto derivatives. BitMEX won’t be the only place to trade.

Believers will always believe, but nay-sayers will never believe.

Well it took Bitmain 2 years to get this new S15 product out to the market. Here is a summary of its specs: 
- **28TH/s**
- 57J/T
- 1596W
- $1475 (are they nuts?)
- based on 7nm ASIC chips
- 7kg
The performance stats are good, but not a quantum leap compared to current gen S9. Considering the S9 is going for $300 per unit, I don't see how the new S15 will stand a chance against its older brother.

Looks like all Avalon. I am guessing these are old machines that are worth nothing these days. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:24:41
Man... it hurts me a little on the inside everytime I see posts like this.
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:24:26
That is exactly what I thought in my mind as well haha.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:36:59
It’s hard to believe how long we have come since like 2 years ago.
