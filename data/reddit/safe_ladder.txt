So all they need to do is find a socket that doesn't work, and then saw a hole in the plywood next to it?

Of course, but you can't be unhappy with a 'small' profit if that's all you were able to put in it. It's still a lot considering what you were able to spend.

Looking at some of the hearings, especially the social media ones, I can't grasp just how many quintessential stereotypical boomers are running the show.
It's like a 4chan boomer meme come to life and honestly, maybe it's for the better that they all start retiring soon so they can have their nurses explain how TeH GoOGle works.

It does suck, and it's a grind that easily demotivates you when you look at how 'easy' it is for those with the luxury of having capital to spend. Still, as long as I'm not part of the majority that loses money I count myself lucky.

"Not that much money"
You would have made an over tenfold profit. These types of gains are incredible and hard to come by in ANYTHING. Be happy with what you'll make.
