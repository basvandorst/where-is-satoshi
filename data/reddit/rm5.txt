Good for you.  It's still a historically amazing price and it's important not to have all of your eggs in the one basket, and especially in these volatile conditions.

So why are you posting it...?
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:03:13
Aw man, I just spent like two days syncing Bitcoin_Qt!  haha.  
I'm going with Electrum because Multibit wanted me to install some Java environment.  Thanks for the info!

Too fast, this is clearly a bubble.  I'm going to unsubscribe now to get out before it crashes!

So in the last 24 hours MtGox has a high of 900 and a low of 500.  I'm sorry but no matter how much you don't want to hear about price movements you can't say that's not something worth discussing.  I would say that (together with the senate hearing), the volatility of the price and the difficulty of the major websites to cope with high amounts of traffic are the biggest bitcoin "stories" of the day.

"Why were you withdrawing so much from ATMs?"
"Uhh, for hookers"

What payment method do you use?
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:16:58
Well you've got bigger balls than me!  You're not worried that you might wake up one day and it's crashed to half price and suddenly you're only worth half as much?
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:45:52


@_date: 2013-11-17 11:20:51
I'd probably sell half, you're right you need to reduce the risk to a responsible level.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:55:50
Pros:  works nicely, no annoying delays
Cons:  might lose 96% of your money
Overall:  Fully recommend!

The day before yesterday I submitted a bank transfer of some of my money to another person's account in a different bank.  They're still waiting for it to show up in their account.  With bitcoin they would have received it virtually instantly.  The same goes for transfers overseas or anywhere - it's near instant and doesn't have to go through some third party.  
So it's practical, and a faster way to do business with people overseas.  I still think it's a bit *weird*, but I think it's easy to see at least some great advantages that bitcoin has.

I don't have gyft but could he have used Safari and gyft's website on the iPhone to do it?

Call your bank immediately?

I bought 1.5 yesterday on localbitcoins - you can select who you want to buy them off and many of them offer bank transfers.  Or cash deposit through the bank.  Just look for one with a decent price and good feedback.  
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:25:02
Yesterday I was reading their entry on Wikipedia and they honestly seem like a real shitshow.  Kind of weird that they could be the most popular exchange.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:15:02
Can I ask, just out of curiosity - are you worried that the price might come crashing down?  Have you cashed some out in order to "lock in" some of the gains?  
Don't take this as investment advice or anything, I'm just curious about people's attitudes to this.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:18:35
For me they were always too much of a pain to actually buy.  Plus I never quite understood them (still don't haha).  
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:52:52
- it can be 100% complaining about all the other bitcoin subreddits :)
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:30:37
Why does my bitcoin client have to be synced with every single transaction ever, which I understand is now 250,000+ transactions?  ie if everyone agrees on the first 200,000 or so, can't we just ignore them from now on?
Also if MtGox is so bad, why do so many people use it?
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:10:33
For me the current "killer app" of bitcoin is the ability to send any amount of money overseas (or to anyone) virtually instantly.  This beats both the length of time (and sometimes complexity) of bank transfers, and doesn't have the same fees as paypal or credit cards.  
The remaining obstacle is the difficulty and length of time it can take to buy bitcoin in the first place.  Once it becomes easier to turn dollars into btc and vice versa, lookout!
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:35:55
Sorry, late to the thread BUT - why don't you show them how to buy them, by buying some onscreen.  Then you could show them how everything works and potentially inspire some of them to buy some of their own to see how they work/help get their heads around the concepts.  
Just my two cents/one forty-five thousandth of a bitoin!
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:58:32
Fascinating.  Definitely keep doing them!
