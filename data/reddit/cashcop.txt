it's very easy to say that with 6 years of hindsight

Definitely way over a single lifetime. I'm talking extremely long term.

I'm not sure if you're playing dumb or are just ignorant

Sure: 
About 400000 confirmed transactions on the block chain everyday, so about 5 every second.

Nobody knows that. Your analogy isn’t really fair as it’s not just hype, bitcoin actually does have practical value and it offers something that no other (real world) currency offers.

You're right. That being said, I wouldn't be surprised at all if physical currency is entirely phased out in the future and everything is done through cryptos. Major infrastructure changes are needed obviously, but I wouldn't be surprised.

Yeah I'm talking about cryptos in general, not just bitcoin, my bad.

Decentralized control, 100% secure transactions, the amount of them is controlled and capped, and absolute anonymity

Think about how the value of any currency exchange rates rises or how any stock rises. Currency is traded on the Forex market, the exchange rate is dictated by that delocalized exchange. The reason that GBP crashed after brexit is because many people sold that currency pair after brexit. In a similar manner, when people sell bitcoin the value goes down and when people buy it goes up. Just like stocks.
It doesn’t really have anything to do with it’s practicality as a currency, but that does help. Just like a stock price technically doesn’t hinge on the success of the company, but obviously there’s a high correlation between success of a company and high stock price,  since more people want to buy it. 
And also what you said is inaccurate, many many people use bitcoin every single day. It offers something no other currency does.
