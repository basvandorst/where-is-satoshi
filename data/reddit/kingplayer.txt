Okay. I've seen a lot of... I don't wanna say *wrong* but definitely misinformed stuff about what futures trading means.  
  
Yes, futures can be (and are) often used for speculation because you don't have to pay the full price up front. Even for Bitcoin, which will require more than most futures, you would need to put less than half of the price you'd be paying at the end. But Bitcoin already has fairly high volatility, and other than being on an exchange that many investors already have access to, and trust, I don't think this by itself does much.  
  
The implication that is (in my opinion) much more interesting is that futures are used for hedging. Businesses can protect against conversion rate changes by selling futures contracts for an equal amount of a commodity or currency they will need to sell later. This *could* (I can't stress the word could enough) lead to further adoption by more businesses, as they can protect against the price changes.

Well, if you had a method to exchange back to USD or another currency easily (not a very low amount of money or black market currency exchanges) you could get a massive rate of return. Compare the Venezuelan government's currency exchange rate to the street (black market) exchange rate if you don't believe me.
