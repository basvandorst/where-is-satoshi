Hoarding/saving and earning is what gives a currency value - spending does the opposite.  You can only spend a currency because someone else is willing to earn/hoard it.

By "invest" you clearly mean either buying something (ie spending), or lending.  If you hold a currency, you can call it "saving" or "hoarding".  From one perspective, by holding a currency, you're expressing your preference, giving the currency more value and, in a sense, investing in the economy as a whole.

This is true in a way, but not for the reason you think.  The fact that they don't appear to work the same is almost an illusion.  
On one hand, you want to collect/hoard dollars (i.e. I'm sure you like to get paid).
On the other hand, you, at least subconsciously, know that you cannot hold those dollars for any extent of time, without the value being destroyed through inflation.  This is a consequence of the new dollars (i.e. counterfeiting) being created through the central banks.

This part actually worries me.  Again, where does the inflation go?  With bitcoin, it goes to the miners.  But the miners all compete against each other for diminishing returns.  In effect, most of the siphoned off wealth is destined to go into wasted energy.  For this, I'm glad that bitcoin has a tapering inflation, going to zero.

So your position is that leaving people free to peacefully pursue their own interest will lead to disaster.  Therefore, a centralized power structure (i.e. monopolized violence) is required to forcefully compel people to do other than their own interest?

It would be a simple matter to accept bitcoin.  It would only be a small amount at first anyway.  They could easily hold it until it was profitable to spend it.  Their employees and suppliers may be thrilled to accept it.

Bitcoin cannot be out-competed.  The most important feature an alt would need to have is that it would need to be bigger, older, more reliable and proven as a currency.
That cannot be designed into an alt.
And on the other hand, if any alt did manage to have a more desirable feature, the feature could be placed into bitcoin.  It's heads I win, tails you lose.

Creating a separate category for currency leaves room for nothing but endless fallacy.

Perhaps I'm being dense, but I don't see it.  The rate of new bitcoins being created is constant regardless or hash rate.  The rate of new doge being created is likewise constant.

You describe only half of the chicken-or-egg dilemma.  
Some, not all, merchants convert immediately to fiat.  But this has very little relevance to the issue.  
If the price of bitcoin were close to zero, then no merchants could accept it.  If bitcoin was the only currency, all merchants would accept it, and the price per bitcoin would be well over $1 million (in today's $).
In an open market, price is an expression of people's preferences, a higher the price of bitcoin indicates more preference to hold bitcoin, this is then a signal to market participants including merchants.

There are two points to consider here:
1. this only applies to debt, if an exchange is settled immediately, one is not required to accept dollars
2. The law, i.e. constitution, actually says "No State shall ... make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts."  So there's already an enormous legal contradiction here.

The Myth of Natural Monopoly
* 
* 
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:07:57
The article wasn't very conclusive in itself, but it demonstrates to some degree how the Keynesians deliberately define deflation as something bad.
Having a background in computer science professionally, this whole field seems absolutely pathetic to me.  They come up with hypothesis from loose over aggregated data and call it conclusive.  It reminds me of when the Obama regime wanted to tax tanning beds to help fund Obamacare, they came up with a study that showed a correlation between tanning beds and alcohol and drug use.
There are many avenues to analyse the deflation arguments to gain a better understanding, here are a few:
* 1) Recognize that correlation does not mean causation
* 2) As outlined in the Apoplithorismosphobiac paper, there are different causes/sources/types of deflation.  To give a current analogy, the fraud (or incompetence) and collapse of Mt Gox is a deflationary factor and it will also cause great harm.  If it were a bank, where such fractional reserve practices are normal, it would spill over to cascading failures of other banks.  All in all, this systemic failure would result in both a damaged economy and deflation, primarily due to the fact that the fraudsters end up with the resources and the producers end up with nothing.  The problem did not begin with the deflation, but with the fraud/failure.
* 3) What IS inflation?  Focusing only on CPI can be a slight of hand.  When the Austrians speak of inflation, they mean an expansion of the money supply.  I.e. new dollars are being created.  But who gets the newly created dollars and what is the effect as far as power and economic structures.  This is really just legalized counterfeiting and fraud.  There's no way that such actions can have a net benefit to society, it's one of the most subtle forms of the broken window fallacy.
* 4) The Keynesians insist that the price of the currency needs to remain relatively steady, but this really just means it needs to be managed by them.  This is a form of price fixing, and at this point, even they recognize that all other forms of price fixing is bad.
* 5) Keynes was a life long Fabian Socialist (named after Fabius the Deceiver) and self-proclaimed Bolshevik, i.e. a Marxist with a goal of scientific/professional management of the economy (i.e. humanity), and an admirer of Lenin, Stalin and the Nazis. (  Therefore his entire approach is suspect, and in my opinion, the entire field as it currently stands should be scrapped.  It should join the likes of phrenology in the dustbins of history.

Someone cannot then say, I have no boat but you have to accept my dollars.  You also totally ignored the constitutional problem.
You do have a point in a way.  Traditionally, what differentiates a national fiat from other currencies, is the others will get shut down.  The Liberty Dollar and e-gold are such examples; the people who ran them got shut down on bogus charges.  But bitcoin doesn't share this central point of failure.

That might be a motivating factor, but the reality is: if the price of bitcoin is low, there is less available to spend.
If I have 1 bitcoin and the price per bitcoin is $5 then I can buy a cup of coffee.  If it's $1000 then I can buy 200 cups of coffee or a laptop or whatever.  Since the total number of bitcoins is fixed at any given time, this holds true for the entire bitcoin economy.

No, this is *ex post facto* justification of the counterfeiting of fiats.  "Hoarding" is subjective and arbitrary.  No one suggests that currencies shouldn't be used, but there's no real way to differentiate between holding and "hoarding".
I posit that holding a non-inflationary currency like bitcoin IS an investment in the bitcoin economy at large.

Another thought on the word "speculator".  You call me a speculator because you think I hold bitcoin because I think it will be worth more in the future.  This is not exactly true; I know it will be worth more in the future, but that is not why I hold it.  I hold it to support the value, so that it can progress in adoption.
And it could also equally be said that you are the speculator.  If bitcoin could be worth 10 or 100 thousand in the next few years, why aren't you buying any?  Because you are speculating that it won't happen.

Sorry, I haven't abandoned the conversation.  However, we have nearly narrowed things down to the crux of things, but I'm not sure I have time to address this sufficiently.
1. I won't defend IP at all - this is a statist concept.  I would argue that *intellectual property* is not property at all.  Remember my definition from before or property, i.e. a *scarce* good.  Anything that can be freely reproduced is not scarce.
2. I would also argue that abandoned land is not owned.  


The Roman population was something like 80% slave.  Of course they couldn't have a principle called "you owned yourself."


Like I said, this is a theoretical position and, I would argue, a fear based opinion.  My position is entirely opposite, I think in a free market, the poor have the greater bargaining position.  This is why laws and regulations are always erected to keep the cost of entry high and the poor out.


I reject this distinction.  The Marxist concept of capitalism i.e. privately owning the means of production is a false one:
1. It is a derivation of the "Labour Theory of Value", which is a fallacy.
2. It's entirely subjective and arbitrary.  A laptop may be a means to chat on facebook and twitter for some, for me it's a means to produce vast software systems.  Your syndicated factory may be a means for the community to produce widgets, someone else may want to use it as a shooting range.  It's the respect for private property that dictates how it's used.

It's not that I think my "state" isn't a state.  You seem to be in denial about what defines the state.  I say voluntary organizations are viable, preferable and moral alternatives to a state.

a) nearly all our interactions are free market.  Free market just means voluntary exchange.
b) keep in mind that a law/regulation is just an opinion with a gun.  So you're arguing that voluntary interactions can only happen with violent interference.
But here's the part that I found particularly fascinating, whole monopoly/anti-competitive theory is more economic myth.  In fact, so much so, that companies get frustrated and petition the government for regulation which happens to help give them a monopolistic advantage.

Yeah, it's not all that mysterious, but it can be hard to understand because we are so immersed in it.  Just as it can be hard to understand atheism if you were raised christian.  A few places to look in this regard are "Manufacturing Consent" by Noam Chomsky, any of the books by John Taylor Gatto or "Tragedy &amp; Hope" by Carroll Quigley.  Short story is there are huge economic incentives for people to set up false bias within their minds.


Nope, I was fooled, it took years of research to get to the bottom of a lot of this.  It was much easier to shed christianity.


Notice how we are talking about crimes here.  Semantics/euphemisms are used to hide government crimes: it's called theft when you do it, but taxation when someone calling themselves government does it.  It's called counterfeiting when you do it, monetary policy when the government does it.  Murder when you do it, war when the gov does it.
Economically speaking, anything by Murray Rothbard is great, but personally, I found his writing a bit difficult at first.  Mises.org, or Stefan Molyneux is a good place to start.  A lot of Rothbard's lectures can be listened to on mises.org, those are really great.  A lot of people recommend "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt, but I haven't read it.

You missed my point.  This scenario of $1m / bitcoin was if it were the only currency, i.e. everyone would be using them.
Perhaps trying looking at it from another perspective.  Perhaps selfishness is not holding some abstract idea called bitcoin (or dollars or whatever) but rather wanting more in a material sense immediately.  As an example, if you were holding a million in bitcoin, what would be more selfish: quit working, go buy a yacht and party it up, or live a modest lifestyle and keep working?

Ah, I get where the disconnect is now.  You're confusing value with price.  Pegged currencies have a fixed price, not value.  Value is subjective, ie it's in the eye of the beholder and changes from moment to moment.  Eg you value a sandwich more when you're hungry than when your not.  Price is determined on the market by supply and demand. 
Now this is literally Econ 101.
Edit: technically, with pegged currencies, you don't really have a fixed price, you have a promise that the currency can be exchanged at a fixed price with another currency, but the price of the other currency will fluctuate.  So it's merely a fixed price in one regard.

a_curious_doge would have us believe that human fallibility, "irrational exuberance", causes a fundamental flaw in the market that only the state can fix.  His very profession (he says he's an economist) depends on such beliefs.  It's analogous to astronomers convincing people that only they can keep the planets inline.  Well, more like astrologers.
However, the "business cycle" is not just a matter of people getting overly excited about one thing or another.  These sort of things come and go without anyone thinking much of it.  Rather, it's a major systemic miscalculation that leads to misallocation of resources due to unseen changes in the money supply.
Yes, minor versions of the business cycles occurred before modern central banking, but these could still be traced back to national banks, government fiats and/or fractional reserve banking.

The Federal Reserve was established and it only took two decades to manifest the great depression.  Therefore free market?  No.
Money is not a power structure unless power is used to establish it.  I.e. that's where the word *fiat* comes from.  When speaking of power, I know communists like to come up with all these mystical meanings of power, e.g. "structural violence" or whatever, but really, it doesn't need to be so complex.  Pretend you're a five year old, go back to the basics and look where people are actually compelled by violence or threat of violence.
I don't have to speak to a "Austrian solution", because there is no such thing.  Any Austrian economist I have heard, makes it very clear that it's a value free study, i.e. they propose no "solutions".
But I also cannot really debate your critic of capitalism, because you're largely correct.  The capitalism we know is a quasi socialist/fascist market.  Keynes, the most influential economist in today's thinking, was a life long Fabian Socialist and hated private property and *laissez faire* free market capitalism.

That's a fantastic response.

There were many crypto currencies before bitcoin, and there have been many since.  What made bitcoin unique and so successful was it was the first to embody Satoshi's profound understanding of economics.  The way bitcoin has progressed is exactly as he understood it would.

I appreciate your sentiment but perhaps you would consider a few gaps I've noticed in your thinking.
You persist that inflation is a good thing.  However, 
a) how exactly did you reach this conclusion?  It's a Keynesian dogma that we have all been inundated from both academia and the media.  I would be happy to point you to more info in regards to this.
b) this inflation occurs through dilution of the money available.  This is something that would be called counterfeiting if you were doing it, but "monetary policy" when a government/central bank does it.  But in effect, what this does is rob those holding the currency to the benefit of those who receive the newly created money.
Muddled message and what people are trying to do is all largely irrelevant.  People are all going in different directions and trying different things.


As an all too experienced software developer, I would say: let's get the core functionality ironclad and then build on top of it.  Most exciting functionality can be built on top of bitcoin.  Bitcoin is not merely a brilliant idea, but it's the first in a distributed ledger that functions as a currency.  It cannot be altered by any amount of physical force.  This makes it extremely unique.  
People can assume that they know how to make it better, but it's not likely that they would be able to come up with an idea that both a) is actually better, and b) can't simply be incorporated into bitcoin at some level

Again, you seem to be projecting without any sense of self-awareness or irony.  It's true that Austrians tend to be libertarian and libertarians tend to be Austrians, but this is because they arrive at the same conclusions for different reasons.  Libertarians say that government doesn't have the right to act because it's immoral as it violates the non-aggression principle.  Austrians say that if government acts, it will inevitably result in a less efficient market.  However, care is taken to distinguish the two.  The Austrians say that it's not in conflict to be pro-government, but you would have to have less regard for the well being of people.
Not all Austrians have been anarchist, I don't think any of the early ones were, Mises, Hayek and etc.  You have your history exactly backwards - embarrassingly so considering Keynes was a Fabian socialist.
Austrians don't consider statistics as being worthless at all, they're used quite often, but rather they recognize that relying on the over aggregation of data results in ridiculous conclusions.

The price of bitcoin will tend towards stabilization with 2 factors, growth of the economy and passing of time.  People's desire to hoard is one factor that adds to the growth of the economy.
As the price rises, this is a demonstration of the growth of the economy, it also attracts others to want to participate.  This is a self-reinforcing feedback loop.

That can't really be answered without getting into Keynesian/Austrian arguments.
The whole supposition that deflation is bad for the economy was developed by Keynes in his General Theory.  Despite this theory being poorly thought out it became popular with the powers-that-be because it was an excuse to increase their power.
One key aspect of his theory however, was that it should be impossible to have inflation and stagnation at the same time.  This was disproven in the 70s when the US had both.  Keynesianism became widely discredited, but it was so imbedded in the culture and economic teaching that we're still stuck with it.

Fairly circumstantial, yes, and not proof, but evidence none the less.  Put another way, if it IS in fact the cause of the prolonged downtrend (and it is within the realm of possibility) you cannot claim that there is no evidence for it.
All else being equal, if people holding bitcoin prefer to exchange it for some widget on Newegg, and there's no reciprocal increase of demand on the exchanges, the price will trend down.

I think the word is 'intuitive'.  Some theorize that because we are genetically programmed to be social and altruistic, we naturally see property ownership as bad.  However, there are many things that are counter-intuitive but true nevertheless.  And no, my view is the respect for private property is the ultimate good, and I believe this is quite provable from a number of perspectives.
However, before I even try to prove this, I would like to point one thing out.  I think we both agree that it's well established that the state is evil - that this is true, not speculatively or theoretically, but by definition.  The state is a group of people with a monopoly of force, excluding themselves from rules that everyone else must abide and they will escalate any amount of violence necessary to maintain this control.
The 'evil' of private property on the other hand is much more vague, relying on speculation of certain theoretical outcomes.  I therefore propose to shift the onus to you.  Even if you are completely convinced that private property is an evil adequate to justify the existence of a state today, tomorrow you should challenge this conclusion with renewed vigor, and everyday thereafter.
That said, two quick things to consider:
1. It may be that there is not actually a real distinction as *private* property.  If property is defined as scarce resource in control of a person or group of people to the exclusion of others, then there is no further meaning that the term 'private' would add to it, i.e. there could be no property that is not private.  And there is no scarce resource desired by any human that could not be deemed property.  If you doubt this, try moving into the White House tomorrow and see how welcome you are. 
2. The most fundamental and inviolable of private property is one's own body, but I contend that any justly acquired property through trade, gift or creation should be equally inviolable.  E.g. you own your hands, but if you make something with your hands, it should be yours as much as your hands.  It could even be said it is still part of you.  We have a conceptual framework that the nature of ownership changes when it goes beyond the boundary of our skin, but that may be an artificial concept.
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:57:52
You seem to be contradicting yourself.  We have been brainwashed to serve those in power, but to call out the truth of it, and point out that they are our *de facto* masters is a silly belief?

Since there will only be 21 million bitcoins, the higher the value the more utility bitcoin has as a store of value.
If bitcoin is $1 then 21 million people could only use it to store an average of $1 worth of wealth.  At $1,000, 21 million people could use it to store an average of $1,000 or 2.1 billion people could use it to store an average of $10.

To ask the questions more important than any particular answer.  A few thoughts:
* The government relies on inflation to sustain enormous, never seen before spending, through debt and money printing.
* This expansion of the money supply through debt and money printing is the real inflation, not increases in prices.
* The government reports this "1.5%" in average increase in prices as inflation.  
* They have a strong incentive to hide the damage done by their debt and money supply, so expect this to be skewed low.
* If you work in the free market, you work every day to bring better goods and services for lower prices to your customers, so prices should be going down, so even if prices are staying the same, the government is undermining your efforts by diluting the dollar.
* This is how the government normally works, but the QEs are putting it all in hyper drive.

"Hoarding" is just a demonization of "saving".  Earning (I.e. Wealth creation) is what fuels a strong economy, not consumption.  And people will be much more willing to work for a currency that promises more value.
The important question to consider is *qui bono*.  When a currency gets diluted, who gets the newly created money.  With the fiats, this tends to be the banks and governments.  With cryptos, it's the miners.  But it's not a good thing for the miners to get too much, since they'll compete with each other until there's no profit and all the wealth goes into energy consumption.

No doubt you are trapped in the cult of statism, however here's a brief history:
The idea "The Federal Reserve System is neither federal nor a reserve" first came from G. Edward Griffin's excellent book *The Creature from Jekyll Island* (1994), which you've certainly never read.  Those who still repeat this idea can be forgiven, but it's outdated.  The "Fed" is an institution which enjoys the protection from the violent gang that calls themselves the federal government of the US.  This gang uses the meme that some document called the Constitution gives them authority over a whole bunch of people but the document effectively says that only gold and silver may be used as money, yet their pet "Fed' continues to pretend their monopoly money is the currency of the land.  And you statist fools believe them.

Fantastic, I'm glad I was of some help.  I know exactly how you feel.  When the price is high, everything seems wonderful and low it feels like it's all going to shit.
But this is totally irrational, and we should have the opposite feeling.  We're in sort of an upside down bubble, where the price goes down because it's been going down.  But this means that we get to hold more of this fantastic invention with less effort, it also means that it's all that more meaningful when we abandon fiat in favor of bitcoin.
Also, there's [this]( .  This is quite fascinating in that it shows we are on a rather rigid track for expansion of bitcoin as a whole.  It's also interesting in that it deviates from the price/btc from January 2013, the time of the last halving.  Since then the incline of the price per coin has increased at a greater pace.  I.e. if there had been no halving, the price now may be around 185.


 That all seems like good news.  It gives us some insight to their books, and implies they're doing very well.

No.  I'm in bitcoin to disempower the super elites and socialist states that control fiats and destroy society.  Only when bitcoin is proven insufficient to achieve that end will I change my mind.
The problem trying to bootstrap latest and greatest is that it would then be wasted when bitcoin 3.0 came along, then 4.0 and etc.
Inversely, if I could take the power to counterfeit away from the fed, and the power to confiscate bank accounts way from governments, I would be sticking to the dollar.

Perhaps you're seeing it backwards.  Just because the relation to traditional currencies can be immediately calculated and adjusted accordingly doesn't necessarily mean nothing is priced in bitcoin.

The logic you used isn't exactly logic.  It's loosely an explanation of what Keynes thought he observed.
Start with wages: ok, perhaps you would have to negotiate a new salary each year, but you have to do this now anyway and it's now weighted against you, ie if nothing is done, you lose.
Debt:  yes, debt would have to be structured differently, but perhaps the current system promotes too much debt and perhaps this is detrimental.
Neither of these points require all that much investigation however once you recognize that the inflation is really just a subtle form of counterfeiting, ie a form of theft.  If you're using the Broken Window fallacy, you may argue that thieves are good for the economy, but of course they're not.

I think a lot of the confusion people are having stems from the fact that they see merchants as separate from other economic participants.  For  every economic participant that desires one thing, like a dollar or bitcoin more than something else, this communicates value by the price.  The more people that value it, the higher the price, and for currencies, this creates better utility for the currency.

It's an interesting conundrum.  In a way, it's a bit of a false dichotomy to say that bitcoin has to solve every problem now, or it's not viable.  The fundamental aspect of it is vastly superior to any currency that's come before simply because no amount of power can monopolize it's creation and transaction.

Wow, you've got some prolific writing.  I'll address things piecemeal if that's ok?


We disagree on only a few points.  Crucial points yes, but I don't see you being that far from being a libertarian yourself.


This is pretty interesting.  I would argue that the biggest leftest organizations are the modern governments.  Their apparent opposition to grassroots leftism is peculiar.  I'm not convinced that it's precisely infiltration but rather I feel this is a manufactured opposition, this is pretty standard elitist strategy.  (I can provide quite a lot of evidence if you're interested)
On the other hand, the Cato institute and Reason are pretty statist as well.  Meanwhile I can think of numerous libertarians constantly under the threat of imprisonment, myself included.  Joel Salatin wrote a book entitled "Everything I want to do is illegal."  Irwin Schiff is in prison, Pete Hendrickson just got out, Larken Rose just got out, Adam Kokesh just got out.   And Shrem and Ulbricht of course.  Many more have fled the country.  You are a suspected terrorist if you carry a copy of the constitution.

Consider the extremes: an economy that used bitcoin exclusively would be far more efficient that one that depended on fiats and banking exclusively.  Therefore, any business that can find a way to profitably utilize bitcoin more than fiat will be more successful in the long run.

Not much.  "We can tie a currency to what everyone agrees is wealth."  This is a rehash of the "intrinsic value" objection made by Schiff, Greenspan et. al.
First, all value is subjective, not merely different for each person, but different for each person at any given time.
Second, it's not necessarily a good thing to tie something with other utility to store economic value, since it will inevitably become more expensive, beyond the value of it's mere utility.  E.g. houses are currently seen as a preferable means of value storage since the dollar is so terrible.  As a consequence, people are holding onto houses just to maintain their wealth, and the result is 10% of the houses in the US now sit empty, utility destroyed.

Again, this is a rule you just typed out, this doesn't make it true.  Free market fluctuations (i.e. volatility) allow people to optimize their positions, i.e. the prices tell you when to spend your bitcoins and when to earn some more. With fiats you always lose, because they're always being debauched.
Over the long term, with more and more actors making such adjustments simultaneously, the volatility will diminish.

That's an interesting thought, and kind of true *de facto*, but you won't find a bit of law that would directly support this supposition.

I totally get the distinction you're trying to make.  I just don't agree that the point is clearly made by throwing the words out there.
And yes, bitcoin is modeled after gold, but it also has some properties that make it vastly different, i.e. because of it's cumbersomeness, gold has never been used in a modern economy except through banks which then allowed for fractional banking.  I'm sure fractional "banking" will be seen with bitcoin, but I don't see how it could become the norm.  
This will make bitcoin a very unique experiment.

I think you may have missed the point of bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the first system in the history of humanity to solve the byzantine general problem.  It is thereby the most trustable (also called trustless) system ever.


The point of the quote wasn't so much about what Lenin thought, but rather the source of the quote.  John Maynard Keynes' General Theory on economics is the foundation of what we were all taught in school, and the foundation of how modern governments and central banking work.  But Keynes was a self declared Bolshevik and Fabian Socialist*.  What you think is the "opposite" problem, is exactly as Keynes had intended... i.e. not one man in a million.  
Fabian Socialist was named after Fabius the Deceiver, the roman general, since their goal was to destroy capitalism in the west by intrigue.

I think you've reversed the problem here.  The influx of gold wasn't a bubble.  There are finite resource people juggle through market cooperation through currency and pricing.  When the supply of currency changes unexpectedly it can throw a wrench into the market.  I don't think there's anything that can be done except to let prices adjust as quickly as possible to swiftly communicate the change.

Actually, there are some interesting nuances from the opening paragraph:


for goods or services, or held for investment. Virtual currency is a digital representation 
of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of 
value. In some environments, it operates like “real” currency -- i.e., the coin and paper 
money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, 
circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the 
country of issuance -- but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. 
1. All bitcoin needs to do is become "legal tender" in ANY jurisdiction to escape this classification.  It might be already in Pine Ridge.
2. I'm not sure the US dollar doesn't qualify as a virtual currency by this definition.

@_date: 2014-02-14 16:39:49
Sure, there is one aspect of spending that can quicken adoption.  Say, people are spending more at business A rather than business B just because they accept bitcoin, this shows that there is greater profitability in accepting bitcoin, which broadens interest in general, and specifically in other businesses to accept it too.  Then, more businesses accept it, and people become more comfortable holding bitcoin as apposed to dollars, because they know they'll be able to use it for what they need.
But this is a feedback loop that is successful because it incentivises holding/acquiring/hoarding.

Again, you seem to be confusing the price of abstractions such as currency with the price of the actual desired goods.  In fact, notice how the prices are 100% inversely correlated.  The higher the value of the currency, the lower the price of the good and vice versa.
The utility in bitcoin is from the network, and I agree that the lower the cost the better, and that is happening.  I.e. greater security at lower cost.  However, this is not the same thing as the value of the token/currency.  To understand this, go back to my example of the extremes, i.e. 100% adoption means millions of dollars per coin and 0% adoption means no price per coin.

"You guys"?  
I was pointing out that this "early adopter ponzi sellout" meme is nonsense.  Once early adopters sell, they no longer have those bitcoins.  They also tend to be hugely anti-fiat, so there's no reason they would want fiat over bitcoin, except perhaps to buy a few things or play the market (which helps balance it).
@_date: 2014-10-31 07:12:32
In theory, there won't be a financial incentive since the value and availability will be tied directly bitcoin.  I.e. you must use 1 bitcoin to create 1 newcoin, and destroy it to get the bitcoin back.  So the only incentive for developing a newcoin is if you want to add functionality to your bitcoin that bitcoin itself doesn't currently offer.
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:08:23
Here's how I see it, I have btc and I want to buy more.  I lend out my btc to someone that sells it, the price goes down, I buy more at the lower price.  Then the borrower has to buy the btc, plus interest, to cover the loan and the price goes back up.

That still doesn't cut it.  The first thing someone will do when they want to grow their wealth is to get a job... a job that pays money.  This is my point, arguments become obfuscated when false distinctions are made.
No one would argue that, if say, people had to use google stock for money, then no one would ever spend it because it might go up in value.  If that were true, no one would ever sell google stock now.  They do, when they want other stuff.
What people really are saying is something like: money should always go down in value.  Why?  Because it always has.  Or because Keynes said that the economy will die because of macro-economics, sticky wages and all that.  But what they're really saying is what Prof. Bitcorn said: because if governments cannot counterfeit, they won't be happy.

If alternative implementations are waiting in the wings it will be because people are anticipating the problems and preparing solutions.  That is exactly what we are now talking about here.

You should ask the Core devs, they made it dependent on hashrate.  Maybe you should produce your own code branch where segwit activates with a high node count.  That would be fun.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:35:50
A hard-fork removes older nodes from the network, whereby the owners have a chance of knowing something went wrong.
Segwit turns old nodes into zombies, it looks to them like they're still functional.
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:06:53
There is no activation for BU, it's behaving exactly as the miners configured it.  The miners will continue to make sure it's configured to avoid forks because a fork would be a massive waste of money for them.
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:15:58


A split is extremely unlikely as it's in everyone's interest to stay with consensus even if consensus changes or doesn't seem to go your way.


If a split were to happen then buying now may be a good idea since you'll then own coins on both chains.

F2Pool never ran Classic, they just changed the version number to vote for Classic.  It was their perception that if they were still running Core they were still in line with the agreement.
@_date: 2016-12-16 20:33:29
Did you just try to change the subject?  
Sure, BU also adds a few convenience features such as Xthin blocks for more efficient block propagation and the Accept Depth to help the node keep on the longest chain so that chain forks can be avoided.  Both of the features make the network more robust, but neither changes what power the miners or anyone else already has.
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:19:57
Very well, let's play your games.  


Excessive blocks are accepted anyway if this many blocks are mined on top of them




No need for average, the precise answer here is currently 15.25% (59/387)
Now perhaps you'd be so kind as to answer my question: by what magical means does BU give miners power they wouldn't have otherwise?
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:52:34
Right, so you have a wonderful scare scenario, but you didn't answer my question.
This same situation exists today, only they would easily kick off nearly every node.  The only thing BU does is make your scare scenario harder to achieve and less damaging if it did.
But if you're afraid of colluding miners trying to damage bitcoin, you need to get out now.  The very concept of bitcoin is that the miners are incentivized to create the foundation of trust.  **This is the very same machine you trust every time you use bitcoin, but you think they cannot be trusted with this one number that they can change whenever they want anyway?!**
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:36:36
Essentially all BU does is take a number out of C++ and put it in configuration.  Anyone can change the number in the code and recompile without BU.
@_date: 2016-12-16 20:02:50
BU can't give the miners any power they don't already have.  You are aware that it's all open source, right?  There's nothing you can do to prevent the miners or anyone else from changing the code however they like.  They don't need BU to change a 1 to a 2 or whatever, BU just makes it easier.
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:14:14


This is not actually true.  If they mine a block before they have the previous one they have two choices, throw it away or publish it empty.  Neither choice makes any difference on how soon the next block will be found that can be filled with real transactions, and so it has no effect on transaction throughput.
@_date: 2016-12-17 06:19:16
In this case they don't have the previous block, just the header.  So they can't add any transactions since they might already be in the block they don't have but there's no way for them to know.  They would like to add more transactions but they can't.
There's only one pool that manages to avoid this by means of really good performance and that's ViaBTC, and they're running BU.
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:45:03
Communication is fairly broken.  This meme is mocking those who are pushing for more on-chain scaling so that cheaper and more plentiful transactions can be fulfilled.  This is an ongoing debate, but only one side is heard here.

You have things backwards.
It does not take "300 quadrillion hash computations" to send $1.  The network miners will compete with each other and increase the hash rate as long as it's profitable to do so.  This is **completely independent** of what is required to verify a $1 transaction.   
If the cost of electricity goes up, the hash rate will go down, but the $1 transaction will still be verified just as well.
This is the opposite of "unsustainable".  This is sustainable because the network will be able to adapt to changes.

So, if I understand you correctly, you agree that these conclusions are at least possible.


Governments are currently forced to use what people will accept for the goodies they desire.  Governments may have a massive amount of control over fiat, but if no one will accept it, it will do them no good.


Except that if all else were equal, which would you prefer to accept from me: GoofyCoin which I control or bitcoin that I earned from someone else?  All things are not currently equal, so the choice is not as clear cut now, but it may not always be that way.


This is not an insignificant point.  Even if bitcoin does not become the sole currency of the world, it very well may become enough of a threat that governments have to curtail themselves just so as not to lose whatever control they can keep, thus resulting in our desired ends anyway.

Central banking and fiats were specifically developed to give counterfeiting power to banks and governments.  This may not be broadly known, but it's no longer all that controversial.  Even Krugman has admitted that it's a hidden tax.

Are you at all familiar with Keynesian, Austrian or any school of economics?  I'm happy to explain the drains on our wealth we currently cope with, but I'm not sure where to start.
As an example, houses are very highly priced because people see them as a store as value, not just a place to live.  This is, at least in part, due to the fact that the currencies are so crappy, that people understand they would be foolish to use them as stores of value.  If you look back to 40 years ago, before the dollar was taken off the gold standard, houses were much more reasonably priced, and construction techniques have only gotten better, which should have brought prices down.

Part of a proper response is: we don't know yet, the market will undoubtedly come up with surprising answers.

I think the answer may lie within your question.  
What would it mean for the dollar to crash?  The dollar gets it's strength from the fact that many people prefer it over any alternative currency (or other value stores).  The fact that it's as strong as it is, shows how poor the alternatives are... until bitcoin.  The rise in Bitcoin IS the dollar (and all other fiats) crashing.
