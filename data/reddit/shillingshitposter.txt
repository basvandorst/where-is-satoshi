I expected the woz to have more common sense than this.

Eye opening. Thank you.  QR change in a picture file is especially scary....
If one follows the whole guide for paperwallet creation then the generation step would also be offline and should be safe.

I think you need to update your review already, erc20 beta client released.  I guess some development is happening?

How is this different than any other robber vs wealthy encounter? Gimmie your car or rolex or gold bars or bitcoin?  Dont flaunt your wealth in general? Why are most millionaires quiet and drive a Toyota Prius rather than a lambo?
If you really want ideas; more than one cold storage mnemonic, give up the wallet that has 1-2 BTC while your real cold storage is truly safe.  Make a seed that has an extra secret word that is memorized or kept somewhere else. If you are forced to get your cold storage out restoring from the 12 word seed opens a different wallet with the bait 1 btc; adding the secret 13th opens the true cold storage.  So many possibilities.  Easy deniability; oh god I wish I could give you more this is all I have! I lost most of my savings when btc dropped to $132k in 2019! Think ahead....

At least give a link to the page so others will know it's a scam.  If it could be reversed it wouldn't be Bitcoin. Sorry for your loss.

Hoping. Would like to pick some on the cheap.

That actually isn't the worst idea I've ever heard...

What is sad is that a few of those are lost private key addresses...

Looks like he is adding to his solid position. How are you so certain that this is not a relative low buy in point compared to tomorrow?  If the price is $14k tomorrow you will be the same person saying 'should have bought the dip LOL'

So.... This can't go into a safety deposit box? CD and usb stick memory deteriorates over time?  A little bit of water or a fire say bye bye to those... $5 wrench attack works with CDs and USBs also???

Be clever. Hide in plain sight. Or bury. More than one. More than one location. More than one country.

One in a billion chance someone else generated a wallet with your address and sent btc to it.  In that case you would both have access to the btc in the wallet.  If you are worried about such a remote possibility create a new wallet and send everything to the new secure address

Oh my god that fee of nearly a full btc *cries*
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:59:51
Why go back to btc?

Slow not dead. Erc20 up on beta client. Kinda nice to have more than 4 currencies at a time aswell.

Except that statistically doctors are very bad with money and investments...

Which dremel and which bit worked for you?
Also you could cut down the cost if you bought a smaller sheet to begin with, saw some for 67c
