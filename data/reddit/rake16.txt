Because of the futures market that is set to open on the 10th. It could get really crazy at that point. I honesty think they push the futures back.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:46:46
Right now, there are roughly 16 million BTC. Your cap is your available BTC x current price. That is your market cap.

And why can’t you manually enter them?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:30:21
Let’s just think logically.
What if you buy it and it goes to zero? Do you think Coinbase would give you zero or 15k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:59
Buy with paypal
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:29:16
Its the upcoming future trade. Should hit 25k before Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:17:54
I think you have a better chance buying 100 lottery tickets.

If you look into him, he seems to be trying to do away with the draconian practices that have plagued Islam. I really like him.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:40:31
Has to be the investors preparing for the 10th.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:21:23
Mate if we knew the answer to that, why would we tell you?
With that said, I would be stunned if it didn't reach 25k before Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:24:56
But won’t lightning render alt coins useless?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:37:02
That would be incredibly stupid. Even if you were gambling, you wouldnt see that quickly. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:37:14
Genuinely curious. Why do people keep asking this question?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:45:46
Here’s the thing. With the futures market opening up, it could literally swing 10k downward or 100k upward. No one really knows. 
I will say this, if you want to “gamble” now is absolutely the best time as this could be a huge moment for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:15:37
Or if everyone will just HODL, it will go through the roof. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:02:48
Derp. Yep
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:50:54
I guess you could try virvox? Don’t know if you would get them today though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:00:51
Now is good. One minute ago was better and so on.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:11:35
Absolutely. Will hit 25k before futures open up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:34:00
lol no. Not at all. How old are you? Have to be under 22.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:24:03
Who would have FOMO and then sell that quickly?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:52:36
College student dies of heart attack is all I see. :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:02:25
FOMO right now. I think it at least hits 25k before the futures open up. There are people with lots of money that can afford to risk what could be a potential gold mine. I don't see a way it doesn't hit 25k before Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:29:53
FOMO. Especially those that have the money to spend. I think it hits 25k before Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:58:29
If you want a 25% return on 500, it needs to increase by the current price(1.25) that’s your number.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:33:32
Uhh.. Just take the theoretical price and divide by the current. Then, multiply that by your BTC you are holding/theoretically holding.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:46:21
BTC could hit a million per coin by 2020... it could also crash to nothing. If it was me, I would HODL for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:05:49
I got dibs on posting this next hour pls.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:16
25k before Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:47:38
Hold on loosely.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:17:33
You would have to be an idiot to finally buy in at 15k and then panic sell when it even dropped to 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:42:36
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:25:01
I think the best way would be localbitcoins.
Not 100% sure about that though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:28:11
lol thats just dumb and not what any investor would do.
