Another use. For sure.

Girls can accept their payment immediately, and know their money is safe with the private key somewhere else.

An entire industry depends on anonymous payment, and less middle men, and you can't see the value in bitcoin for it? I think actual thought is something you forgot to bring to this sub. Why does everyone on here act with such hostility as default.

Thanks, but we sent money from Aus to US a few years ago - from bank account to bank account, and it was hell.
 I got stung with fees for international wire transfer (a % of total) from the sending banks, and receiving bank, currency conversions.... Never again. For moving ~$50,000 it came to just over $650 in fees.
I'm going to explore all the options but I have little faith in Bank to Bank. 
I will post my experience with this next year.

Sorry. Meant to say they'll make it illegal. Not stop it.

I have the cutest hard on right now

Brain? As in brain wallet? If something were to happen to you, your coins are lost? No failsafes to see you BTC gets to your significant other or family?

I won't be surprised when they claim some act of violence "involved ISIS (insert any other terror group name here) using new encrypted iPhones, and funded using Bitcoin" to be the next ploy by these guys. They need just a little ounce of reason to revoke the right to encryption.

Drunk college chick. Yeah, I totally forgot what subreddit I was in and wished it was going in that direction. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:53:51
Exactly. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:18:02
Wait.... You sent Bitcoin directly from Coinbase Wallet to DNM wallet? 
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:19:50
Tumble? Just stop sending Coinbase owned coins to a DNM. 
You may have legally purchased the coins, but keeping them on a Coinbase account means the private keys are entirely in their control. If you set up a transfer from a bank to a DNM or Wikileaks this would happen as well. 
It's not *your* coins until you own the sole private keys. 
Buy them, get them out of there, then do what you want.

What is DNM?
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:00:21
Yeah. The bank currency conversion were particularly painful. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:06:51
They charge more to the customer. If you look at the exchange rate they add a small amount to the paying customer compared with coinbase. It seems everyone over looks this.

The argument is that a competent insurance company has active involvement and oversight in securing high value assets. If this was a bank vault full of Gold, the insurance company may say that they need to inspect the security features. Any large withdrawals would also have to involve the insurance company - multiple fail safes. If they were insuring Bitpay they should have made rules saying any large withdrawals need to have the following security measures passed, and them informed. Bottom line is that this insurance company probably gladly took the money but did not actively make sure the BTC stash was properly secured.
But damn the CEO was a bit careless - that goes without saying.

I think that's "fractional lending", not "fractional reserve banking". The latter involves the bank only holding only a fraction of what they offer as loans.

I've used coinjar multiple times over the last week and it's been easy and quick. I don't hold any BTC in the wallet unless I'm trading it. Holding any BTC online for storage I crazy.
