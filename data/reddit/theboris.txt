Instead of spending mental and emotional energy on deciding whenever to keep or spend, spend it on figuring out how to earn them.

Did anyone here bothered to take a look at BTC/USD rates this year and compare it to Ruble? It wasn't Ruble that dropped almost to 1/3 of its price during 2014.
Next boom... yeah. Just keep saying that. Should help.

The negativity here is a back side of a lot of fanboyism presented in Look, BTC is a nice technology, it's a really good protocol which is fun to work with. But if you think it's alone going to make you rich and there will be some "OMG next Bitcoin boom!!!111"... well, there will be someone preparing a cold shower for you.

If we start blaming Stalin for every death that happened in the USSR in 1930s, we can put the blame on the US as well for creating Great Depression which had triggered a lot of global events (including collectivization in USSR, btw). Those blaming Stalin always forget about historical context.

The total number of victims of Stalin's regime is about 3 millions, for all 30 years. It didn't happen overnight.  
And stop repeating that nonsense about 30-40-50-and counting.  People saying that have no historical documents to base their judgement upon, they simply repeat it, increasing the numbers as they pass that crap by.
