I agree and this makes me kinda "tensly interested" in what's happening next. Big Banking is coming in and we are facing a new unfriendly takover attempt. Interesting to see how that plays out.
Personally I see the long term purpose of bitcoin as a "world reference currency" that can be used to hedge and benchmark other cryptos and alts. 
In times of populism, unrest and a trend to extremes on every end, a currency resilient to big companies, governments, bank collapses and forced immigration could come in handy.

It just confused me into thinking that my monitor is upside down.

Or at 16k. Both will happen.

I deem standalone PoW as not sufficient. However i can not agree with the tweets statement that an equally secure PoW to Bitcoin is not feasible today. It is because Bitcoins learning curve is open and everyone can study and learn from it.

True that, didn't consider that one. Hardware gets considerably cheaper tough (Moores law etc). How is the impact of that? Does it rather help to attack pow chains or the miners to build up faster? 
I am a supporter of vertcoin because of their democratic non-asic (asic resistant) approach. But due to recent events I feel that a mix of PoW / PoS is becoming a must security-wise.

If I bought BTC instead of every coffee, snack and other bullshit for the past 5 years I would be filthy rich. Still made it to drink less, eat healthier and be well off. Cannot complain and dont regret.
