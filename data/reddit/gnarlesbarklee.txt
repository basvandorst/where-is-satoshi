Yep, that's the plan unless I can convince her to hodl  
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:55:08
Haha if only. She's aware of how much it's worth now. I'll probably buy it from her and hold it, but it sucks to buy the same coin twice without ever selling it

I find it hard to believe that you managed to figure out how to mine bitcoin before it was even a month old, but can't figure this out. That said, if you're being genuine then good luck and more power to you!

Congrats! I'm working on getting my parents into bitcoin as well. The more people using BTC the better.

Agreed. Quantification of currency must be made relative to a good/service/other currency. I see it as no more unquantifiable than any other currency

No doubt, there is a bit of a disconnect there. Where do you prefer?

This is the new wild west. Expectations will be met with equal parts glory and disappointment. Pray for glory, expect disappointment.
Edit: HODL strong

Was it about IOTA?

*Investing. I phrased that poorly

Gemini really is my favorite exchange. If they started supporting litecoin it would be the only one I used

Too bad he couldn't stick around for 2 more years to see the first bitcoin get mined.

On a Tier 3 account under the funding (or whatever its called) tab it often times would say that the service was unavailable. Other times orders would fail due to some error, I'd be asked to refresh the page and try again, but it still wouldn't work. I actually lost quite a bit of money because of that. Those are my only two complaints, but if you can't reliably move money and make trades then it's a risky platform to trade on IMO.  
If I'm awake and had some coffee: GDAX,
If I'm tired, or have had a beer or two: Gemini, 
If I'm piss ass drunk: GDAX again, one look at that UI and I remember I'm drunk and shouldn't be making trades.

Do you already have a coin base account? If I am remembering correctly I made a LTC purchase with coinbase via a bank transfer (took about a week) then when I moved to GDAX all I had to do was verify my id with a photo id. It only took about 5 min to get started. I don't remember anything about verification steps though

Very well put

Yep, in addition to stepping away from XRP, I learned not to trade on kraken. Others may love the platform, but it's been nothing but nightmares for me.

Haha yeah, not the greatest segment ever. Still nice to see a successful investor who isn't into bitcoin just to make a quick buck.
