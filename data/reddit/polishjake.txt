@_date: 2019-07-02 08:10:39
Yes. But don’t sell your condo for it.
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:46:31
Silent before the storm ! Great things come unannounced. That’s what I think :)
@_date: 2019-07-05 06:10:50
Yeah I’m stupid I know
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:20:43

He was bearish at 5k and went bullish at 13k. I watched some of his videos. This guy is a lunatic.
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:08:01
How to interpret this sh**?
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:03:29
Yeah pal you go and wait.. time the market - easy
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:21:31
Putin is doing his shopping
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:23:04
My stand is that he needs to be put in jail before he steals that retired people’s  money
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:17:44
If goes to 8k, imma buy more.
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:51:16
Maybe I am
@_date: 2019-07-20 12:17:51
100k is imminent ��
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:15:18
That is why i got out of alts, I actually broke even but it’s just the mental health when you keep alts , you never know if your heaviest bag just won’t die out on you.. I will stick to BTC since it’s the best bet for long term. I also didn’t go in crypto with pocket change so I don’t need to 1000x to do good.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:31:28
I like when it’s going down also - shopping time.
@_date: 2019-07-05 06:10:59
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:59:05
I wonder what happens between July and October
@_date: 2019-07-06 09:51:41
That’s me right there..
@_date: 2019-07-19 11:48:22
He predicts all day everyday so it’s no achievement that finally one of his BS actually happened.
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:37:58
That is the kind of answers I wanted to hear! Clearly you are all HODLERS and I am with you !
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:48:26
Tesla would be enough for me :)
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:35:54
One big order and your TA goes down the toilet. Not hating TA , just saying.

Bloomberg is full of shi*
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:00:16
Would love to hear about that also
@_date: 2019-07-18 11:54:40
BTC I trust, HODL I must.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:07:15
Thanks for all the support and kind words. BTC is King.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:35:20
Don’t worry about me man I’m not someone who would get robbed easy  ��

@_date: 2019-11-21 19:35:28
I got cash
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:34:49
What’s not legit about it man ? I got cash lying around and I want BTC, same when you don’t have a car you got meet up with someone to purchase one for cash. Lol.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:38:05
And if your talking about me robbing someone no thanks I got better ways of making money plus I don’t want to go to prison for few thousands euros.peace
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:27:19
What is the safest hot wallet ?
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:43:35
Good point
@_date: 2019-08-27 10:55:42
Well that’s what I’m saying, now everyone calculated how much BTC grows every bull cycle and they just think this will happen again and again and everyone expects it to go to 300k
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:11:32
What ?
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:57:04
And you think BTC is going to follow your trend Line forever ? ��
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:54:42
Im not talking about the people that are not invested in BTC and people who hate BTC and crypto all together. I had in mind people of reddit and youtube , people who love the fundamentals and those who truly love BTC for what it is.
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:23:52
Most of us think that 100k will hit next year. So that means most of us are wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:23:26
Ok I already have the S , so is there no way for me  to store my BTC on that just because I cannot install the software ?
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:36:34
F*** tone vays
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:35:13
Great advice on the end there. I totally agree. Just to clarify I meant that affording a few satoshis would happen when BTC reaches crazy prices like 1 M
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:07:13
Please be extremely careful with trying to cash out his bitcoins, if you trust the wrong person your money will be gone. Do not share any information , especially digits and letters.
Safest way to is to educate your self about the subject and withdraw the money your self.  Just do a ton of reading before you attempt anything.
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:12:10

@_date: 2019-08-07 18:30:31
I care
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:10:14
I got it 2 months ago
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:31:44
Yeah I know. But theory stands. Crypto Daily is actually Ok because he is not trying to act as magician
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:44:33
Wow thats madness
@_date: 2019-08-27 10:15:26
So anyone can comment on sentiment back in 2016 early 17 ?
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:21:37
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:23:21
Okay and what do you mean exackly ?
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:33:25
Hahahaha themoon.. come on this guy in every video predicts both outcomes .. one is we go higher other is we go lower and then next video he says his right.... don’t listen to anyone man
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:31:11
Actually when you see so many green huge dildos and all the euphoria on reddit about the moon and lambos , then it’s obvious.
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:33:24
Yes that’s I’m talking about, no one was expecting it then and now everyone is expecting it because it happened. People know now what BTC is capable of.
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:59:42
Imagine paying 100 bucks for BTC that’s ok right. Pay a 1000 it’s still ok but a bit expensive, pay 10k ? Most people cannot afford a whole BTC at this point. Pay 1 million ? 99% of population wouldn’t afford it in their life time.. and now think about all the whales that own 10,000 bitcoins or way more, imagine how rich they are while “normal” people can only afford a few satoshis. Also it’s crazy that the couple of whales own more BTC than the rest combined...
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:48:33
Bro I never called a top before that chill
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:23:21
Thanks for calling me names and wishing all the worst. Karma is a bitch. BTC going DOWN!!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:06:04
Prove it
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:47:23
Nice to see people that value each other words based on a time frame of owning an account on a  Internet forum. ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:37:15
Yes but some not bought yet. Many many of us are waiting for that magical 30-40% and test of a month moving average which would give us a real bull market and not just a parabolic FOMO !
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:05:18
Who’s the boss ���� test of 9k incoming !
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:18:05
It will not god damn rise for ever guys what the fuck is everyone on here on. You all must be holding 2017 dec bags
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:53:36
Guys I sold all. I’m in TUSD now. If it goes to 20k screw it. I just don’t believe it will go up much higher and will stand buy it. I will buy in when price drops ! That’s it.
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:44:51
Bear market rally ?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:34:59
Thanks man, I appreciate that tone.
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:52:17
Yes i also seen that screen shot of that forum..
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:11:57
I just sold all my BTC to buy back when it dips. Cheers.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:14:00
I just sold all at 13700 and officially called the top
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:42:56
Not immediately after a bear market. It’s funny how everyone thinks this is it we are going to 180k, and yet they not see that just 6 months ago we were at a bottom of bear market. In a normal bull cycle this doesn’t happen so quickly, look at your chart.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:17:01
Hahaha ok����
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:10:55
Call what ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:29:51
You don’t get to tell me where can I share what PAL
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:13:24
I just sold at 13700. All of it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:15:29
I just sold the whole lot at 13700. That’s it for me.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:04:40
I wonder what your reply would be if I had an account on reddit for 10 years. „ i am selling” ? ����
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:09:08
That’s absolute bull shit , have you ever been called a smart ass and maybe got a punch or two for it in school ? You probably did. I don’t have to present you any arguments. I sold my BTC and that’s my choice. And your bullshit reply referred to me being only 3 months on Reddit so stfu smart ass
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:06:44
It’s getting there
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:46:07
I just sold man believe me.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:26:42
Bitcoin is cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:11:13
No it wasn’t me.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:17:59
Bitcoin is a part of cryptocurrency market. What is your problem.
@_date: 2019-04-28 19:34:11
I’m a bit worried it might come earlier, stock market prices are going through the roof , it looks like a massive bubble. Of course it might not come to that. Let’s hope it doesn’t.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:48:25
So what it’s a fact because anon516 on Reddit says it ? Chew on some Ripple kid ������
@_date: 2019-04-28 19:30:02
Man you act like communist or a part of a sect. I don’t want to get in a rant with a closed minded person like yourself but you cannot predict the future and you don’t know how things will play out in 10 years. Maybe bitcoin will get mass adopted and maybe not. You don’t know that. Bitcoin is a great coin right but you can’t stop ENJ being used within games , or Facebook creating its own coin to make profit from the market place. Anyways I’m not gonna argue with you I just want to know people opinion on my question. Peace out.
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:45:46
I have used coinbene to trade some scam token which are not listed on Binance. I had no problems sending BTC to my Binance account.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:33:15
You don’t have to “explain” me anything, I got my own mind. You may call it your opinion. Which is totally wrong IMO but suit your self.
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:45:46
The TA heads will join when we break out the big triangle at 11.2- 11.4k
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:19:35
Good call.
@_date: 2019-09-01 21:10:18
Why question it ? Looking to troll around ? Lol.
No man I’m not looking for satisfaction, I get that from my girlfriend.
I announce it to show people that are selling now to see that smart people are buying up their BTC which will be worth much much more in future.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:19:46
Never in your life time.
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:49:50
12k incoming with in next 24h. BTC dominance rising. To the moon guys.
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:59:06
Hahah good one
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:44:25
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:53:43
Say it like you mean it bro :D
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:01:44
Just ask him for a BTC instead. Say it’s your hobby and that’s what you want.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:47:45
I hope your right. We need to set things straight. To be honest though I place 0.01% chance of that happening. People don’t give up power just like that.
@_date: 2019-09-09 06:13:24

Most dangerous words investor of any kind can say ; “ this time is different”
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:30:30
That’s a terrible idea.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:21:51
Can someone explain me why someone would prefer buying on PayPal instead using a credit card and buying straight from coinbase or binance ?
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:48:57
Yes it will. It will never drop below 10k ever again in our life times.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:21:32
Well 1 million $ is a lot of money too ��
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:37:13
Hi. No thanks. Bye.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:18:06
We will have enough energy for everything pal, don’t you worry.
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:43:25
No because in 10 years I will kick my self for taking so big of a risk because then 500 satoshi would be the price of a round trip to Mars
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:52:50
New all time high just before Christmas this year guys. That’s my guess.
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:49:51
This is , you better have your space suit on guys.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:13:56
Better ask at Bitcoin price talk
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:47:59
Man I’m not done accumulating I need more dips than just one before 100k:(
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:50:59
Well . You could go on welfare and then I guess it’s kinda free for you :D
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:44:42
I agree
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:51:42
They only sell BTC , I cannot find any atm that gives me cash for it. And I need 2500€ cash quick.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:57:33
I would believe you if your name was Mark Bull
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:32:12
I don’t really understand, who doesn’t have a credit card ? What’s stopping you from transferring BTC from your hot wallet to gambling websites wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:47:36
Will do Sir !
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:42:03
Best is to buy directly from Satoshi because exchanges have high fees
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:42:28
It looks like someone is still waiting for a dip ������
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:45:06
Thanks thanks , I speak 4 languages so it can be confusing sometimes..
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:41:16
I’m Satoshi Old
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:37:01
I was meant to write Me and my brother in law.. anyways everyone gets it ;) I ll send ya all a post card to those who are waiting for a dip
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:37:26
What is the title ????��
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:56:28
Actually I did same and it had fallen down within 5 minutes ������
