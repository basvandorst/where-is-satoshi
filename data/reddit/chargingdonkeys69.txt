Lol I think the fancy asic rigs payoff in a few months.... but that’s assuming a stable price. Doesn’t it show you all that on the mining rig page? power consumption etc?

Like “protecting” ppl from easily purchasing btc via credit card so ppl don’t excitedly over invest.... yet we were fine giving risky ppl massive mortgages and loans and we see what that caused lol. Government doesn’t want btc hurting ppl, that’s their job!!!

Ppl do the same for the stock market though. Everyone raving about the record highs then a 1000pt correction and then they switch and talk about economic weakness lol

Who cares let it drop someone else will happily buy btc when it drops. It’s legal gambling
