I'm still not seeing how is this discussion is related to what my original post was talking about?

So ummm there's probably a good explanation but why are you both tagged as "redditor for 2 weeks"?
I know it is possible but it's not very probable.  It seems a bit too much of a coincidence you both joined 2 weeks ago, you both joined the same sub, you both went in the same thread and found each other.
Did you perhaps create two accounts when you joined reddit?

I am struggling to understand about the value of digital currency.
I completely agree that Bitcoin is finite in supply but digital currencies in general are infinite in supply.  New currencies get invented every day, all it takes is someone to invent the next fad currency and everyone starts switching to that finite supply currency.
This switching between an endless creation of "finite supply currencies" effectively means digital currencies as a group are infinite in money supply and as a group they become a fiat currency.
Not trolling - serious question - what am I not getting?

As an old guy this reminds me of the extreme acceleration before the tech boom collapse
People were saying "This time it is different (to normal booms)" and "you just don't get it".
All the way up the left side people were calling out the price of every tech stock they owned and counting their open profits.
All the way down the right side, sour faces and silence and no open profits - just margin calls or years of lost savings.
Remember - the trend is your friend 'til it bends! 
Closed profits are the best profits.

Just a salary at a company.  I have lots of experience but even a graduate from university will make 20-25 per hour in our country.  Online freelancing you are competing with the world so you'll be taking much lower rates to compete with the Indians.  However you should be charging more than 100 per month.  Focus on quality over price so you can charge more when people get frustrated with the cheap coders.

Yep they only want Yes Men.
I think the best approach would be take them on a contrived learning/tutorial exercise designed for them to eventually come to the conclusion you are trying to get a across.
People accept ideas more readily when they think they've come up with it on their own.

I totally agree, we have think tank meetings about blockchain but don't even mention Bitcoin they just don't understand that the two are deeply integrated and I can't bring myself to tell them and I don't think they'd listen if I did (plus I have massive public speaking anxiety - so it isn't going to happen).
As I implied I don't think they fully understand what they are doing.
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:23:32
They are already working together.  I work at one of these banks and they are most definitely working together as a group.
Whether or not they understand what they are doing is another thing :)
Have no doubt that another digital currency will be created by the banks eventually.  The banks are truly on a mission to win here.  I doubt this currency will cause any problems for bitcoin though.  You need to be more concerned with legislation killing bitcoin (prompted by banks asking government to outlaw digital currency that doesn't meet AML requirements).

If you manage to get millennials to encircle the planet around the equator and then jerk each other off, that would pale in comparison to the size of the current 'ok boomer' circlejerk underway.
OK Boomer millennials are no longer fresh meme users, the meme is stale and now they themselves have become a meme.

It's still trading but as you say it's definitely an edge case.
You are still buying 'X' (Bitcoin) at price 'Y' and you *trading* it for 'A' (Ransomware payoff) at price 'B'.
You've traded bitcoins for a service.  That's still trading.
Most of the people that dispute they are trading are people with either very short (you) or very long holding periods ("investors").
In this case you've got a short, basically instant holding period.
A trade is still taking place.  It's just that there is not enough time for the price movements of Bitcoin to have an impact on the trade value.
If there was a 1 month settlement delay on your ransomware payment then the movement in bitcoin price would have a chance to impact this trade.  Imagine you buy 1 bitcoin to pay them off and price goes down by 50% or up by 100% over that 1 month delay.  That price movement dramatically changes the outcome of the trade.  It's only because you've got instant settlement that it doesn't seem like you're trading.

Read '[Trading in the Zone]( to learn about the real enemy of trading success (hint: your psychology).
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:32:02
Hmmm not sure I really agree.
The technical name for this strategy is "scaling in" or "pyramiding" into your position.
I've tested many, many trading systems on stocks, forex and futures (systems with positive expectancy) and I have NEVER seen any system perform better when using a pyramiding strategy.
From a technical trading performance standpoint it's a bad advice.
They are effectively suggesting using a technical strategy that worsens your account performance to address a psychological issue.
IMHO if someone is having trouble with the psychological side of trading they should try to address that with some self help (maybe read: Trading In The Zone by Mark Douglas or some other trading psychology books) or maybe even see a professional.

Everyone is a trader.  They just don't realise it or don't accept it.  You buy and sell you're trading.  You buy and hold forever you're trading, with an infinite holding period.  Investors are traders with a long holding period and bad risk management.  So given we're all traders we should make use of trading tools.  To not do so only harms your chances.
If you care about a good entry then technical analysis (looking at the chart patterns) is quite useful.  Not because there are some magical patterns in prices but because market groupthink/psychology is revealed in price behaviour.
For example from a technical analysis point of view there is a clear downtrend in place (the market is making lower highs and lower lows) so until you see some positive confirmation from the market that a recovery might be in progress then you should stay out rather than ride it down until it turns around again.
You probably want to see the previous highs (not all time highs) start to be broken before re-entering.  Momentum trading works very well but the momentum needs to be heading in the right direction.

Use a volatility trailing stop so you don't get out too early or too late. 
Profit stops are generally a bad idea in all the trading system testing I've done in the past.
@_date: 2019-12-17 04:51:08
Make sure you are using all the trading tools available to you.  Technical analysis for example would have kept you out of the market since mid-late July when the first lower high occurred.
As soon as price action starts making lower highs you are in a confirmed downtrend.  You need to start making higher highs and higher lows before the uptrend is confirmed.
The most bullish sign was the push through $10k in October but it had no follow through which is a bad sign.  It did start sitting on top of the bearish channel instead of within the channel.  The lack of follow through is really a sign of a [dead cat bounce](
It does seem like there is some disagreement starting to enter the market now.  At a minimum you want to see it close above $8k as this point I reckon.  I would want to see a higher low created and another impulse upwards after that though.
Trying to time the exact bottom is a fool's errand.  [Averaging down]( is also a fool's errand also.  People who say just keep buying on the way down are not people you should be listening to.
Why buy lots of small positions from $12k down to $6k when you can put a full position on at $6k (or maybe even lower!).
Red dots = continuing series of lower highs (the $8k one I probably wouldn't call major high either).  Until you can start breaking the red horizontal lines I would just let it continue to slide.

In my mind, a good digital currency must be able to survive any attack on the network without the help of forum warriors.
So given Bitcoin doesn't need your help defending the network you should really just calm down.  
If Bitcoin can't handle the attack then it needs to be improved.
(disclosure: I own neither Bcash or Bitcoins - I simply dislike the bickering between the two - Bcash forum warriors are just as bad as Bitcoin forum warriors)
