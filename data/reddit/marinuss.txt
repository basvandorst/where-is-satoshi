Technically you could make a wallet with a TREZOR, write down the recovery seed, smash the TREZOR and then a year later load up a regular software wallet on your pc and recover the wallet with the seed. 
Hardware wallet is secure because the keys never leave the device. And any interaction with the device requires a pin. And the pin can't be keylogged because it uses a grid of randomly positioned numbers.

But why? With BTC they can charge outrageous fees that are well above network cost and make more money. With BCH they can't really charge you $10 more per tx when the tx is so cheap to begin with.

Forks will never make it big as long as they continue to offer 1:1 coins on the new side.. for doing nothing. Forks are a cash grab. Have a bunch of BTC? Scam your way into pushing a 1:1 forked coin, let it jump in value for a bit and dump those coins. Repeat.

I started that route too, but he is selling a physical card version of this puzzle on his store with the same type of "treasure hunt" thing behind it... so i doubt it **requires** digital forensics. It's gotta be something with what is displayed.

I can 100&amp; confirm there's no stegonography for the simple point that the OP sells this image on a card \(think greeting card\) in his store with the same description as he posted here... blah blah blah satoshi and the history of crypto... and there's a treasure hunt for 1 BTC on it. So it would be impossible for it to be anything forensics related on the file itself.
Plus I already ran it through binwalk and various steg programs.

I'd use the iancoleman site over [blockchain.info]( Their recovery page is only setup for their wallets, so 12 words. OP could have used less, more, etc. If he used 12 you could figure it out on there but no point taking chances.

No, it can't.  
A bichon frise and a maltese are related. In the widest of definitions they are both dogs \(cryptocurrency\). Long ago they shared the same ancestor \(code\), but if every maltese \(bitcoin\) just disappeared from the planet you couldn't all of a sudden call a bichon frise \(bitcoin cash\) a maltese, it's still a bichon frise.  
Your tl;dr is taking an extreme angle on the consensus of people. If you got 51&amp; of the world to call a dolphin an airplane it doesn't mean a dolphin is an airplane.

Well running it through binwalk showed no extra signatures for a hidden zip with something else in it or another photo. Ran it through a few steg programs and nothing came up. No special flags or anything hinting towards anything hidden looking at a hexdump. I know I spent quite awhile playing with curves to see if anything weird popped up but nothing. I have an idea that is panning out thematically with his original post message but the biggest hang up right now is... how many seed words? Is there an additional passphrase like "satoshinakomoto" attached?

Modern day slavery?  
Being an American citizen comes with some inherent benefits regardless of where you are in the world. You're paying taxes because you're still able to vote. You're paying taxes because if NK snags you up they'll negotiate for your release. You're paying taxes because if you're sightseeing through Iraq and ISIS grabs you, you'll most likely get rescued by people putting themselves in personal danger simply because you're an American citizen.  
So yeah, the US isn't taxing you just because they're dicks.. it's because in the government's eyes it makes no difference if you're in Japan or Idaho you garner the same amount of support from them.

My thing is... it HAS to skyrocket. If Bitcoin is ever intended to be a "legitimate" worldwide currency people have to stop thinking in terms of a full bitcoin. There aren't enough full bitcoins for everyone to have things priced at or near a bitcoin. You have to get to a point where the smallest fraction is worth say a penny and a full bitcoin is an astronomical price (which doesn't matter because full bitcoins will only be traded at that point as huge shifts of wealth).

It'll stabilize eventually. There's two problems with it stabilizing right now -  
1) Supply is still flowing in relatively quickly. While you can't really go out and solo mine coins up with your CPU (or even GPU) right now, it's still very profitable to pool mine even for the average user. An 8x 1070 Ti GPU setup that runs you about $4 grand with average electricity costs will net you about $600/mo profit. An Antminer S9 asic miner which costs around $1500 (when they're in stock) will net you about $700/mo profit. Even though a good portion of coins have already been mined there will be less and less that get mined as the years go on to the point it'll be 150-200 years before they're all mined up.  
2) We're still in a transition period where people are coming onboard. Demand (new users) is outpacing supply. At some point X years in the future when your average person, investment fund, etc all have a stake there will be less "shock" on the market as fewer new people come in to buy a large stake.  
What we're likely to see is Bitcoin continues to rise in value as a whole, quickly.. and as it starts to get to "absurd" levels of value like $20,000... $30,000... $40,000 per coin we'll start tracking prices by mBTC because people won't be buying "a coin" and transactions will rarely be done in the full BTC realm.

Probably cashing in to reopen the claims and state payments will be in "USD" based off the price the BTC was at the time of the hack. Mtgox lucked out the price skyrocketed, allows them to cover every dollar stolen at the time the hack happened. They could never cover the pure BTC repayment to people, nor could they cover the converted modern sell price of BTC compared to what you had. The only way for them to pay anything back was USD based off what you had, because they could sell what was in trust for 100x what it was worth when the hack happened.

Claim BTCP (Bitcoin Private) fork of Zclassic. You got 1:1 BTCP for any BTC or ZCL you held. To claim forked coins you have to sweep your private key of the wallet that had BTC or ZCL into the BTCP wallet (which in a legit world just checks you owned X amount of either at the snapshot and credits your BTCP wallet with the same). But since this was a "high-profile" fork and there was a delay between when they announced the snapshot being complete and an official BTCP wallet being released, scammers took advantage of people who were impatient.

$899 minimum on Amazon for a 1080, most are $950 and up not Amazon fulfilled. MSRP for a 1080 is $599...... 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:08:18
No. 1080 MSRP is $599. 1080 TI MSRP is $699. It really blows your mind when you think about GPU costs right now. The Titan X had a MSRP of $999, usually only the Titan cards are at a grand or more retail (normally retail). Mining has nearly doubled the cost of every card. Even places like Newegg to "combat" miners sell a lot of their GPUs as packages now (with say a monitor) at a $200-250 increase in price over MSRP.
