OP wanted a card that he could spend his Bitcoins on. The product that was recommended doesn't even support cryptocurrencies. Lol. How is that for a "working" product?

I was part of the closed beta and tried the app. Just today I bought cryptos directly in the open-beta app with my other credit card. Much simpler than to go via Coinbase. Super slick. The Monaco cards will hopefully come to Europe this summer. I am really looking forward to ditching most of my bank and credit cards and just use the Monaco card and app for all my needs. The credit program and auto-invest will come at the end of the year sometime, and I am really looking forward to those as well. Customer service has been great so far, but it's too early to say anything now before the cards roll out.

Will be - in the future -, unless something better comes along. Comparing all the crypto card projects in the field, I have come to the conclusion that no other project offers or will offer better products than Monaco in terms of perks and fees. Add auto-invest and credit line, and Monaco will be too far ahead to catch up to.

They don't offer support for cryptocurrencies. They charge $2.6 per ATM withdrawal. No cash back. No airport lounge access. No perks.  I have no idea what you're even talking about.

Go to Monaco's website. You obviously know nothing about them, yet you were able to present a "superior" product.

Correct. Monaco card will be the best choice for travelers like yourself - that's their target group, or so they claim. There are higher tiered cards with even better perks and higher limits if you opt to go for one of those metal Visa platinum cards.
EDIT: what's up with my flair?

I said they *will* be. Unless a competitor comes out of the blue and offers or plans to offer a superior product.

That's right. They haven't launched their cards yet. But that will change very soon (this summer?). So in the mean time you could use another crypto card, and then switch to a Monaco card when they become available.

Great to finally get the recognition for my work.
