I've been through your comment history
Troll somewhere else, mate

Just sent ~$ 300 your way, hope it helps these poor children
@_date: 2014-08-01 22:27:46
ok, whatever u say
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:55:52
Note, I m ukrainian n have checked n verified everything. I m defending Ukraine orphans in their endeavor.
blacksmithroad is an anonymous internet troll, a throwaway account created by another fellow person, *redditor for 1 day*, whose comment history can show that he is just trolling this ama.
Ukraine_orphans have done their best to explain n prove themselves, n there is no need to say they r 'masked'. That blacked out photo doesnt change anything except the fact it prevents from internet trolls n haters like u. Also, they submitted unedited photos to the mods. They actually send a detailed letter, with further points, their situation etc to the contributors of campaign via mail. Of course blacksmithroad n his friends didnt receive the mail, since they have been busy only in undermining their efforts n sincere cause.
Yes, there r lots of scams n bad people in ex soviet countries, but i request people here to not feed the trolls n help the ones who need help, in this case this campaign by ukraine orphans

Ukrainian here, n i m going to defend them since i see u are one throwaway account for the same person as well. Your style of writing, language and hatred makes me sick
Documents that they provided are completely real. They include link to see if it are photoshopped or not
I can read ukrainian language, n they clearly tell what they are for
Your only claim, is some internet link by central registry, which i m sorry to tell u is poorly maintained. Website itself clearly says that they are not responsible for any of it information there. this is just for showing e governance which actually does not exist in our country
my own registry documents for home had same serial code as my neighbors' in dneproptrovsk, ukraine n i had to spend long time n bribery to get it changed
these people also asked u to meet in person n see the children, why dont u do that? where r u hiding now?
i pointed out that n other few people r same trolls n sick people who just always suspect any serious cause. being skeptic is ok, but u people make me sick, as a credible n valid cause is being hurt because of u

U sound like a [14 yr old kid]( sitting in the mom's basement, whose only source of information is fox news bullshit, and then he forms simple interpretations - americans are good, all russians are evil, or western ukraine does this, and eastern ukraine does that.
My question is also same - have u ever been to Ukraine, kid?
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:38:11
I dont think i have poor english, n sorry if that is a bad thing. I m still learning. Accept my sorry if that will help
I m in fact going to be in kharkiv next week, with my girlfriend. We have written them for meeting, n will post our experience right here.
Seriously, u seem like a teenager american who is just pissed off because he couldnt get his xbox to play, really.

I m ukrainian n this is great to see the kind of effort bitcoin sub making here
Lets push for more! 
+$200 coming soon over your way, brother
Slava Ukraini!

i want to see something positive to happen in my country n smiles for these children, n last thing i want is for some sick troll like u to spread their hatred across n demotivate people
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:52:29


With what authority you claim that there can be no UPA flag at all in eastern ukraine? 
@_date: 2014-08-01 21:28:55
"they have not provided sufficient proof and those saying they have are being misled. There's a reason many people are saying this is not right."
Actually only u (again, redditor for 1 day) and other throwaways n alt accounts r making up this shit. I do appreciate u taking the time n effort to post these links, but sometimes the way these charities work, there can be a difference between supply n demand = we may not know about some small charity in a far away town for example.
People are not stupid, and those who want to support will do it. Proofs are here, and I have seen and supported. If you don't trust, you can actually just look somewhere else. Or, post here the receipt how much have u donated to the charities u mentioned, can u?
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:44:56
oh, so now i am also a liar?
yes, because being in same time zone makes u suspicious?
