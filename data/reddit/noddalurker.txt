When is the next having?
@_date: 2017-02-24 22:36:42
One of the best? Is there something that has done better?
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:13:12
Aint nuthin wrong bout callin shit shit. You don't need better data to do that!

There seems to be more as well, miners dont want all the transactions to be mined up by someone else, nor do they want massive blocks in the chain because the blocks need to be downloaded and stored. So in BU protocol they are constantly signalling how big of blocks they are willing to accept. This is where it gets messy though, it is in miners best interest to tell the others that they will only accept small blocks because that is best for them, however it is also in their best interest to accept a block if it is going to be accepted by the group, so this results in lots of miners pretending to not accept blocks but then actually accepting them.

Which ones are performing far better than btc?
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:38:16
Well, there is another reason some miners dont want segwit, they want people to agree on making the block size larger. I don't know why they prefer this, but you can see how with segwit there is less need to enlargen the block size.

Yeah, possibly. There is also BU (bitcoin unlimited), from my understanding it allows miners to make blocks as big or little as they want, I think that larger blocks would take longer to mine, thus those doing larger blocks would mine blocks less often, but their reward would be higher since more txs would fit in them. I am sure it is more complex than that, but that is the general idea I think.

I don't know enough about eth to say. However, litecoin is possibly more likely to start using segwit before bitcoin because they are going to switch once 75% of miners begin signalling(btc requires 95%) and litecoin is still increasing the % of signallers(btc has hit a plateau).

Cool, yeah i checked and thats what i found too. However there is an issue of the time it takes to pass your block around, if we both mine a block at the same time and mine is 1mg and yours is a 100, mine will most likely get added to the chain because more miners will know about mine first.

Thank you for your input. Back and forth discussion can make grasping things much easier.
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:44:00
Yeah, I was told that this is the main reason that it probably cant work.
@_date: 2017-02-25 20:19:28
Not at all an expert, and I very well could be wrong, but to address your second question: 
The less transactions that fit in a block, the higher the fee you pay to motivate miners to put your transaction in a block. It is miners who need to signal for segwit, they don't all want fees to go down despite the fact that it would mean more transactions per block. Nobody knows what would result in more money for them, more transactions or higher fees. If fees get really high, it could mean mass migration to anorher coin that can handle more transactions.

Btc was $750 3 months ago, percentage wise for this very short time span eth slighty outdoes btc, in any meaningful comparrison eth fails misserably. To pretend eth is a crypto currency that is doing far better than btc is dillusional at best.

Does this mean dont send coins now? Or has the fork not really happened yet?
