Want more cash? Invest in more hardware. The only advice I might give you.

This notice is driving me crazy on mobile app. Why wouldn't they add "Do not show again"...
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:48:07

I currently have Alfa 147 in diesel as my first car and it's amazing. Thanks to BTC and hodling I plan on moving on soon but Alfas, I can recommend to anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:31:28
I dreamt of BTC going down to 5k. I hodled and bought more. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:19:20

I was talking to my buddies on ventrilo how I'm gonna buy the coins and hold them. They convinced me it's losing cash :'(
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:02
Blockchain.info? Pretty good imo, I have over 4 BTC in it now and i use it for few years now.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:46:50
You can buy one from me I'll ship it to you by   UPS or FedEx. Only 5 btc contact me :)) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:49
Blockchain.info is about 15.5 rn
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:02:50
You explained it like a boss

Well, 
how long would I wait for transaction to get confirmed, the fee was $0.3 and the weird thing is, the page doesnt even show that the transaction has 0 confirmations, not even a label for it.
   
what the heck, i ocassionaly use bitcoin and never had such a problem
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:08:23
Seems like it just got it first one. Usually it said "0 Confirmations" and now the label was nonexistant so I was a little worried. Nevermind, thanks and merry xmas!

2Factor Authentication, you set up a Google Authenticator on your smartphone and pair (correct word?) it with your account, so whenever you log in you need to give the code generated by the app
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:20
Well played, you had me wind up
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:01
It's never too late. The general thing people would tell you not to spend more than you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:52:57
I can recommend Nitrogen. Best one out there. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:02
I have over 3 on blockchain, I might consider hardware wallet but I'm safe as of now with 2FA and stuff, never been paranoic about it
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:09:00
Dw you will have multiple chances, if not at $9k then at $10k when it dropped from $12k 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:41
It's gonna be alright bud
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:07:26
Well, it won't ask you for the code on your smartphone because... why? It will ask for the code when logging in on the website.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:03:44
I wouldn't mind 
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:55:59
this is hot shit 
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:01:53
Thanks! Jesus I was actually scared reading posts of people @ bitcointalk.org.
I have used ViaBTC TX Accelerator and it suceeded, hope it helps.
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:41:41
Why? Sorry, I am not really expierenced and don't do anything special using bitcoin. Will the transaction pass tho? And what to use instead of Blockchain?
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:56:09
Does he have a bitcoin client already installed? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:02:29
Thanks!
