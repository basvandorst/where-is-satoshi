Anything used as "currency" outside of the game is considered currency. Blizzard doesn't/won't care if a country considers it a real currency or not.

You're not supposed to ask questions. It's in the rules.

As I said I'm not too into the Bitcoin scene, I own some Bitcoin and I'm subscribed to the subreddit, but I don't submit that Bitcoin is the greatest thing in the world. Apple not supporting bitcoin isn't an issue to me. Simply put I feel Apple makes superior products to their competition and I would rather support a company that doesn't support bitcoin than to have to use a lesser product in order to make a stand.

This is my favorite


The best cryptocurrency platform doesn't destroy peoples cryptocurrency. I think the key word here is *try*.

It's just part of the bit coin circle jerk. If it is something bad about fiat currency it is good for bit coin.

The 5k may be a sure thing, but 10k may not. Thus the best bet is to buy all you can and hold on to them. Then when it only hits 5k you've made 10 times your investment. Where as if you bet it, you'd lose it all.
And if it does hit 10k then you've now doubled the 5k mark and none of your BTC was ever at risk. (excluding the market itself)

I actually saw the advertisement for Gyft on the sidebar when I made the post and checked into that. It looks like the most viable option so far. But technically you're still cashing out and paying with dollars.
 I wanna spend my fancy magic internet money!
