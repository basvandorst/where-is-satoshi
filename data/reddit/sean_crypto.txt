Just take a deep breath and realize that life is so much more than all this. Markets are cyclical. These are dark days in this market, but they will eventually brighten up.

Be careful about feelings. Markets can be, and are currently in the case of bitcoin, irrational. Price can move more than you expect in either direction for no discernible reason. ��

You’re right, it’s scary to see, but bitcoin has seen 80%-90% drops before. So this really is nothing new. It’s a very volatile asset class at this point.
And as I mentioned earlier, the mining cost will continually lower as needed due to adjusted difficulty, so mining will always return to a state of profitability. This is how bitcoin is designed. When a potion of miners stop mining because it’s not profitable for them, the network hash power drops, and the mining difficulty decreases. This decreased difficultly in-turn requires less electricity and therefore less cost to mine. It will always balance out. 
What we saw last year was a huge bump in miners because it was so profitable due to the high bitcoin price, so the mining difficulty was increased to compensate for the high network hashing power. This process will go in reverse as bitcoin’s price drops and some miners leave the game.

Bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts. If the price of bitcoin drops below the median cost to mine it, a portion of miners will leave. Then the network will adjust the difficulty to compensate for the lower hashing power, thereby reducing the cost to mine.

Not all coins will recover by any means. But if you believe bitcoin will die, then this is not the right investment space for you.
Big players are making too much money going short right now to start going long. When selling pressure ceases, the most financially advantageous position switches to going long. They make money both ways, maybe more when shorting with leverage.

One thing to consider is that bitcoin has seen these prolonged price dumps repeatedly throughout its history, and it has remained resilient every time. As it continues to fall in fiat value, the mining difficulty will continually adjust. There really is no point at which it will “break”.

True, but don’t underestimate the power of the bear in the mid-term
