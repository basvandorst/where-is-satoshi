Once you start paying for things online with Bitcoin, you realize how much of a pain in the ass it is having to type out credit card details on a site you've never used before.
@_date: 2015-06-03 03:43:03
I don't. I honestly do trust Coinbase with my BTC. I just think they have outrageous policies on deciding which orders to cancel. Fucking annoying.
@_date: 2015-06-14 10:25:13
First fuck yeah
@_date: 2015-12-18 10:07:22

I know, Circle has been great. Except I can currently only buy $750 worth of BTC a week.
@_date: 2015-06-03 03:54:38
I know right. I was always the motherfucker to downvote all those posts which talk shit about Coinbase and getting buys cancelled. And now it happens to me.
I don't understand how Coinbase can stay in business if they cancel so many transactions. I am literally the ideal Coinbase user: I'm a student, I live in California, and I don't use Bitcoin for sketchy shit.
@_date: 2015-06-03 03:39:29
I believe you still have to go through the same buy process.
@_date: 2015-06-03 03:36:10
I promise you this is legit. I hated all the people who shit on Coinbase, because I've never had to deal with any of the problems people ran into. Until now.
I'll get a screenshot of the email they sent me in a bit.

I've purchased Litecoin before on BTC-e using Coinbase BTC. That's about it
@_date: 2015-06-03 05:49:53
I buy and sell on LocalBitcoins. I needed this amount to spot a certain amount of BTC I didn't have from LB
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:25:58
But why, from a consumer's perspective, will it ever be useful for shopping? As the parent commenter noted, Bitcoin doesn't offer many benefits to the consumer.
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:16:27
Solution: buy 1 Bitcoin and buy an Xbox One from Microsoft with said Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:41:42
On a Bitcoin subreddit. You got guts.
@_date: 2014-12-15 06:36:01
It was a joke. I was saying you could support Bitcoin at the same time you buy an Xbox.
@_date: 2014-10-02 19:57:00
I think the general public thinks Tor is bad entirely because it's associated with illegal activities and markets.
@_date: 2014-09-12 09:06:54
I like a lot of things Bitcoin has to offer. I just don't trust myself to secure my own coins and not accidentally lose them all.
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:34:43
Interesting, I had no idea.

If you did not have 2FA enabled, they have no obligation to make this right. Enabling 2FA on your account should have been the first you had done when depositing almost $10,000 into your account.
In regards to withdrawal security, CEX.io sends you an email to confirm any withdrawals before they happen. This is more secure than most Bitcoin clients/exchanges, including Coinbase and Bitstamp.
Think before you act.

One of the great things about Bitcoin is its ability to evolve. The protocol can always be modified to incorporate these features.

They could have been leaked from another exchange, and coincidentally some belong to Coinbase accounts.

But as it stands now, these drugs are illegal in the United States. This still gives Tor a bad name.
EDIT: Downvoters, explain why you disagree with me. Don't just mindlessly downvote.
@_date: 2014-08-26 21:17:00
Bam! Right on the money. IMO, Bitcoin will succeed entirely because of its ease of use. As long as it's easier to setup a secure Bitcoin wallet than to open a bank account, Bitcoin can't die.

Think of your bitcoin wallet as an email account, your public key being your email address and your private key being your password to that email account. Anyone can send emails (bitcoins) to your email address (public key), but you need the account password (private key) to send emails (bitcoins) FROM your email address (public key). Paper wallets essentially hold the password (private key) to your email account  (bitcoin wallet).

Nice work! Sort of an odd question, but how can we confirm that the actual App Store app uses the same source in this git repository? Couldn't any developer release they're app as open source but modify the official app binary to contain malicious code? This is no way an insult to this developer in particular.

Well, you could buy a Bitcoin-related domain and do some heavy SEO so your site comes up when someone searches "bitcoin stock". And then you could just feature a Bitcoin explanation video in the index of your site.
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:02:16
You could have left off the www. Why the hell are people still using that subdomain
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:05:20
I don't want to it be anonymous. I want it to be your quintessential stock market, but instead of buying, selling, and paying dividends via USD, you would use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:33:26
No, what I mean is any company could list on my hypothetical exchange, whether they are in the bitcoin sector or not. Take for example, Tesla. If Tesla wanted to move away from the NASDAQ aka the dollar, they could become an available stock on my exchange. Buys and sells of Tesla stock would be via Bitcoin instead of dollars.
The industries of listed companies are irrelevant. Does that make sense? Let me know if this is confusing haha

@_date: 2015-02-22 00:57:54
Just tried this out. Wanted to get a Chipotle burrito delivered to my house (nearest Chipotle is about a mile and a half away), so I texted Magic and they offered $20 to get a $6.70 burrito delivered here. I told them I was not interested because of the price, and they offered $18 as a final offer.
Very pricey IMO but it most likely depends on the type/quantity of items you want.

@_date: 2013-05-01 23:15:53
I understand that; what I don't understand is your idea of having funds in both exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:40:06
What size bit did you use? This looks amazing!
@_date: 2013-06-23 16:58:35
Use Coinbase
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:45:15
Use Bitstamp with Dwolla. I think it's free.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:31:11
Damn, I had this idea a couple months ago. Good work
@_date: 2013-05-20 13:33:00
I know this, but having funds at both exchanges requires that I keep some BTC and not sell it off right away, so if the price drops I'm screwed. If I buy transfer sell, then the price doesn't matter, just the difference in price.
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:28:53
I know, but it doesn't let you read QR codes or send money.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:43:59
Use Bitstamp + BitInstant + Dwolla
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:50:08
I would recommend Coinbase. As far as I know, there have not been any reported instances of hacking or theft on Coinbase servers. They seem pretty trustworthy and are backed by a lot of large companies. Do make sure you utilize 2FA.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:06:10
I understand that, it's just that they don't own up to their mistakes.
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:39:10
Why. Why couldn't it.
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:57:52

Are you still interested?
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:11:47
Thanks! However, I am trying to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities in bitcoin; is there any way to speed up or even bypass this confirmation time?

I thought we were gonna stop using Mt.Gox prices...
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:06:04
What exactly are you asking?
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:24:49
I have tried to do this EXACT strategy. It does not work because the confirmation time is too great.
@_date: 2013-06-13 15:01:10
You tell me. I'm willing at any price.

Sue them. They can't take away your money without telling you

Based on today's price (9/3/13, $130:1BTC), you are a very rich man.

Proof? Anyone could put a picture of a Ferrari on this sub.

But then if the price of BTC hit bottom I would lose a lot of money.

Thanks for this, I'm glad you commented before I put a lot more time into this project. It looks as if I'll be switching to Android in the near future :)
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:25:02
Is there any way to prevent this? For example, a photo ID verification?
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:06:39
My question is, how does the possession of one's key pair translate into the spending of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:52:42
There we go

I hate it when developers refer to programming as "cooking" or "baking."
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:07:23
I'm looking into that now. Thanks for the input!
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:35:13
Damn, you deserve gold

That's what makes my web app different. As of iOS 6, when a website asks for a user to upload a file, it can redirect to the user's camera. They can take a picture of the QR code, and then I can use a JS decoder.

Damn I'm jealous
