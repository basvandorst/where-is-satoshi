But writing a bill to ban exchanges is different from banning exchanges... hence, fake news......................... a lot like this reeeeeee trump gonna be impeach cause we’re in legal proceedings. When in reality any case they have is a projection of what the dems have been doing this whole time and trump is proving clean as a whistle.

They each support several different coins, you can store 4 at one time on the ledger nAno s, but It can remember up to 20 and you can delete/reinstall wallets when you need them and the coins will still be stored on your seed in the device (your 256bit key)

Send another low transaction with high fee to the same address, miner will pick up your new transaction and hopefully get your low fee one in the same block. Worked for me.

Try sending another low transaction with a really high fee to the same address, the miner will pick up your new transaction and hopefully process your stuck one in the same block. Worked for me with a low fee transaction I sent a few weeks back. Goodluck.

Hey thanks for the tip. I went with Ubuntu 16.04 as someone else suggested its supported until 2020. 
Are Ubuntu and Linux one of the same so your instructions would still apply?
And will disabling SSH file sharing limit me from things I would normally do day to day or does that stop things like remote desktop and similar hidden remote hacking tools?
EDIT: Any guidance/vids for doing what you suggested would be helpful, I have ubuntu installed now but wary i'm gonna fuck up settings. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:04:08

You need to set up your own wallet, somebody gave me this advice in this thread.. 
"Many people will recommend a hardware wallet. You can use Ledger products as an example, but Trezor is another popular hardware unit.
If a hardware wallet is too expensive, try using a software wallet like Electrum, but make sure you read up on how to properly secure it and create backups."
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:43:56
Well clearly your having issues, I've used desktop all week and only problem was delays for verfication, sepa etc.

I knew about it for ages but didn't invest, only when my sister starting talking about it I realised this is about to go mainstream and I better get in quick. I also thought back to conversations I had with a friend who is an early investor and probably retiring at 25 now. I think the more people see it in use the more it will snowball.

Governments and organisations worldwide are using disinformation to spread FUD in many forums. Every teenager, adult and grandparent should be aware of this and awareness needs to be raised so people go out and find the correct information on a given topic. That's my opinion at least.
Bots being the main form of delivering this disinformation/propaganda.

The actual news says they say they have to pay capital gains tax and police have suspicions of some people doing some laundering scam.
Notices are being issued and they will have to pay capital gains tax on the Bitcoin investments and trade, a senior official said. The notices to HNIs and their business entities will first seek their relevant financial details and subsequently establish if there is a case for raising a tax demand.
Suspected black money being converted into white, post-demonetisation, through the use of Bitcoin was also under the department's scanner, officials said. Earlier this month the value of a Bitcoin had leaped to a phenomenal USD 20,000 from USD 10,000 at the start of the year.

The actual news....
We've had the article in question all day over here. The premium dropped out once that article was released, but it's pretty much relaxed overall and waiting on US markets.
The announcement was not about a ban, but that they are going to impose more stringent regulations and sooner than anticipated. They said they're going to do what they can to make it as difficult for people to exchange and most likely limit the amount people can use on exchanges through KYC.
Here's a full translation AND other news:
A government official said on August 8, "We are actively considering ways to prohibit transactions on domestic exchanges by judging virtual currency trading as a deceptive means of deceiving people and similar currency transactions" under the penal code. " He said, "It means to seriously view and regulate virtual money traders at the pornography handler level."
Other government officials also said, "It is government's intention to eradicate speculation by making transactions uncomfortable, even if it is not a total ban." He added, "We will adjust the differences between the ministries and give them a regulation next week."
In this regard, the Ministry of Justice, which leads the Virtual Currency Task Force (TF), focuses on the legal basis to stop the operation of the virtual currency exchange. An official from the Ministry of Justice said, "If the exchange registered as an online telecommunication dealer hurts investors, it can be canceled." If it is not possible, "He said.
The Ministry of Strategy and Finance recently confirmed that banks have banned foreign remittances related to virtual money over a certain size. A bank official said, "We have been instructed to confirm that if the name of the recipient is 'BIT', which is an abbreviation of bit coin, it must be a virtual money transfer."
ANOTHER ARTICLE
The government has started to prepare countermeasures by seeing the virtual money bitcoat craze as a very dangerous speculative situation.
A government official said, "I think it is a situation that we must catch the flames that deviate from the usefulness of bit coin and overload the fire extinguisher right now." "We can not ban investment at all, but we are thinking about investor protection measures such as limiting the amount of investment and limiting investment qualifications." In the case of P2P (inter-personal transactions), the government restricts investors to 10 million won per company, and implements regulations to protect investors against risky investment in financial products.
The government's review of the need for investor protection is based on the belief that students and low-income brackets can no longer be left in a regulated blind spot to engage in bit coin speculation. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon said in a Cabinet meeting on October 28, "In the case of young people, students are quick to make money, and they are used for virtual currency or for fraudulent crimes such as drug trafficking and multistep crimes. It is time for the ministries and commissions, including the Ministry of Justice, to look into the matter. "

AND finally this is the latest news we have regarding any of the topics at hand:
South Korea lifts the ICO ban for professional investors
South Korea plans to strengthen crypto-regulation and lift the ban on ICO. This was stated at the discussions in the National Assembly by the vice-president of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) Kim Jong-bhem. At the same time only professional investors will be admitted to the ICO.
The main objective of the forthcoming regulation of the cryptocurrency in South Korea is to counter money laundering and tax evasion. The official noted that cryptocurrency is not a payment instrument or a financial product, but in the growth of the course he found elements of the Ponzi scheme.

The green are buy orders and the red are sell orders. There you see 6.3 bitcoins for sale at 16381.03 and 9.03 bitcoins at 3 cents less underneath that. Above in red is a purchase order for 1.5 bitcoins at 16381.04. Anybody can set any buy or sell price at any time and the cheapest will be sold/bought first.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:02:11
Yeah. These dams currently produce like 10/15 times more than required to allow for scaling over the years. Mining helps with the waste.

Am I being paranoid ordering a Trezor from companies like Amazon, thinking it could be intercepted/modified? 
Reason I ask, I read about the wikileaks CIA hacks/iphones hacks, Iphones being intercepted at the manufacturers etc.

You write down a recovery phrase when you set them up incase you loose it, my concern is do the manufacturers have access to that phrase.

Beware of historical analogies and 'I knew it all along' thing. As humans, we are prone to hindsight bias, a tendency, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been easily predictable. We are all blinded by hindsight bias because our brain looks for simplistic linear link between cause and effect. This way when an unexpected event happens, the brain uses the knew-it-all-along mode to cope with cognitive dissonance and make sense of the surrounding world. While trading hindsight bias harms you in two ways: a) it drains you psychologically for not making 'the right' decisions in the past, and by luring you into oversimplified historic analogies, b) it creates a false sense of investment security at the present time. Just look at everyone complaining they've sold their BTC at the worst possible time (as a matter of fact, I am no different – I still autodestructively loathe my decision to liquidate a large portion of my BTC portfolio after the BTC price hiked to 8k). It is also very tempting to think you wouldn't miss 'the next bitcoin'. The problem is, though, that it is incredibly difficult if at all possible to spot such an opportunity. You have to be either lucky or extremely well informed (and lucky) to capitalize early on such opportunity. In reality, it's very difficult to differentiate between useless information (noise) and something that truly matters (signal). Which brings me yet to another point...

@_date: 2017-12-13 12:03:54
Thanks for this. This seems like the most hassle free way of doing it, what happens with my windows partition once I've done that, do I delete it?

Kinda contradicts you saying how he/they would be so distressed with the current state of the project that they wouldn't want to keep up to date with it..
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:18:30
Judging by all those cold hard facts you definitely know what you are talking about. /s
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:53:28
kraken is one of the better ones, but you need a wallet in any case. Get a Ledger nano.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:36:53
that makes no sense
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:34:19
Holy shit thats cool

 put the address you sent it to after the / and see what it says.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:34:47
Lol i'd be pretty damn proud of myself if I made this project right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:12:17
Do these people offer any more info other than giving a warning?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:04:57

@_date: 2017-12-20 12:20:09
dono but Bcash is scam coin 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:15:16
that why I have set up a wallet on my smartphone and sent funds there and I have ordered a ledger nano s hard wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:50:25
thats a pretty huge culture change, bit too soon I think.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:55:33
Lol with the amount I sent it would have been signinficantly higher than $5, I'm extra proud cause I made a huge return on the BTC I sold for an alt that got pumped :) 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:07:49
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:53:20
I think it may be in a few hours 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:04:33
Yeah I appreciate your first point, still would be cool to see the math though, thanks.

This is what I was after, thank you a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:52:24
my first point still remains.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:07:05
Make a plan with all the costs and risks, get legal advice and present it how it could work, with as little effort on their part as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:24:11
bitcointalk.org, @_date: 2017-12-10 01:33:38
or i'm being extremely cautious while I wait for a hard wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:02:43
Yes this is correct. Open Gdax, click deposit on the left, select coinbase acc, enter btc amount. 
Then after you have set up your wallet click withdraw on gdax, enter address and amount and your done.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:23:14

Dono but Bcash is scamcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:42
there is no record of any transactions yet but there is delays at the moment, that could be why. When did you send and did you put a fee?
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:49:33
Sorry I was just highlighting the retardation 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:54:16
Thanks again for your time :) Have a good day. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:49:02
When you see BTC in your coinbase account, you do not hold that BTC, coinbase does.
I don't understand what you mean by coinbase to coinbase transaction, unless you mean sending your own BTC to a friend or family member, then all they are doing is moving it from your coinbase account to the other account, and the blockchain has not been used to do that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:52:08
I prefer my world looking after my fellow man by living honestly and within the confines of the law. Don't like em, try change em.

That looks fun, certainly a project for the future.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:39:53
Always a risk but people have feedback, go with people who have 100%
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:07:28

My strategy is hold and then go to New on bitcoin and call out all the liars and special interests for spreading false information and FUD about fee's,segwit and scaling in general.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:47:37
Awesome, thought so.

@_date: 2017-12-09 21:37:38
I've made several posts on several boards today offering my telemarketing services for free to try and contribute to bitcoin but not 1 response, maybe someone would feel better paying my boss instead and booking me for the day lol, I'm shit hot on the phone and want to help build confidence in bitcoin in businesses. I'm not sure if its too early for all that yet though, literally not one helpful response all day on here or Bitcointalk. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:01:48
That’s pretty ridiculous you certainly should not have paid that much. Did you have any options to change the fee? You should have waited and asked your question first.

Well i'm following him on Bitcoin, he claims to have met with 36 top bitcoin professionals and seems well informed and is building a program which I won't be buying. Time will tell, don't understand why people don't back up their claims.. I assume everyone is a shill with behavior like that, a lot of people do too.

because the first thing new crypto people are seeing is a bunch of REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:18:46
Unless that code is an encrypted wallet key then it is likely to be a code used by the casino to find what amount they owed you and then somebody would physically go on their bitcoin wallet to send it to the address you wished.

I deposited bitcoin from another exchange (binance) bought some bitshares, left bitshares on their own wallet and then withdrew my excess btc back to my ledger. It’s a open source exchange, worth checking out. Don’t think you can get usd withdrawals but worth looking into for buying Alts
