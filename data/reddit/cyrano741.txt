I work on a competitor to bitwall ([coinwall.co]( and this is indeed a problem. At present, there are two straightforward ways to solve it:
1) Go off-blockchain (this is what Bitwall does--they use coinbase)
2) Set a minimum fee for micropayments (around 4-5mBTC, this is what Coinwall does)
Both approaches have their ups and downs, philosophically I think that if we should avoid introducing trusted third parties for micropayments. The premise of bitcoin is that we cut out the trusted third party, and in his original whitepaper, Satoshi did call out micropayments as a specific place where bitcoin could succeed.

This looks like a very useful service for transacting in bitcoin online. My big fear with buying things using bitcoin, especially for lesser-known merchants, is consumer protection. Multi-sig escrows is a good solution to that problem.

Yea--micropayment channels are a good idea, the only problem is few (no?) wallets support them.

Any more details on this?

Not exactly. Pools that report false data will be quickly found out by pool participants, who will see that they are getting less than expected revenue.

I made a plug-in for Electrum that re-buys bitcoin for you automatically after purchase (using Coinbase,  I could add a feature that let's you select an additional percent to buy on top. That way, each time you buy, you are increasing your overall holdings.

If you introduce a TTP for micropayments and require it, then bitcoin isn't really an improvement over other payment processors. If you give a choice, that is different, but remember that as it stands, the blockchain can't support a large number of transactions per block.
I did mis-understand the implementation they are using for the Sun-Times, though. They are not using Coinbase; it is just a straight, on-the-blockchain payment, no TTP required.

Can you tell us what your profit margin is? How significant is the variance to you hitting ROI?

Do you have a source on this?

Electrum has a plugin for this:

It is a year-to-date graph, showing the last 6 months of the bitcoin price. It is not disingenuous and shows that the bitcoin price has been decreasing over the last 6 months. Bloomberg's job is not to execute a pump &amp; dump of bitcoin.

If you see a paywall, tell them to use  a bitcoin paywall that doesn't require you to sign up for a monthly account or enter your CC info!
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:36:07
Coinbase checks if you have sufficient funds, so the bitcoin purchase should fall through, but sometimes it may overdraft. So be careful.

Looking at the opendig, code, I think is correct. It is true you can connect to your own namecoind instance, but as says, most people do not. If they are instead connecting to namecoind run by someone else, this is highly insecure--the person can just locally path some code in  to return fake addresses.
What the OneName people need to implement, if they want this to be secure for practical use, is SPV mode for namecoin.
EDIT: You could, with opendig as written, connect to multiple, authenticated remote namecoind servers, and only accept responses if, say, 5-of-5 agree. This is more secure than just one server, although you are still at risk if there is collusion among the remote servers. And note that this is different from a 51% attack--the attackers do not need hashing power to pull this off.

When you make the paywall, you enter the addresses you want to receive payments in. This can be just one address, or multiple addresses. You also set a base fee, say .0001 BTC. When a user visits your paywall, my service will add a small additional challenge to the base fee, say .00000001 BTC, so the total charge is .00010001 BTC. The challenge fee is used to ID users, and currently the max challenge fee is .000001 BTC.
If the service goes down, it will just say "Loading..." forever. The user will not be prompted to send payment. This is because the payment address and fee are retrieved live via an AJAX call. That said, it's hosted on Google App Engine, so hopefully it won't go down.

Have you thought of accepting BTC *only* in cases where you are not allowed to process credit card transactions?
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:28:25
Check out  a bitcoin paywall. It requires no registration which is a big upgrade over traditional paywalls that require you to enter your credit card info, sign up for monthly accounts, etc.

Mining is the basis of bitcoin, and it's useful for people to at least know that it exists. Some people may not care, but some will. The people who do care may end up being more likely to evangelize or tell their friends.
Also, it's important that people feel that bitcoin has a solid technical basis, even if they don't understand the details.

Is there any dev work being done to reduce the amount of time it takes to confirm transactions? Is it even possible?

Does anyone know the story behind this unsubstantiated statement from the aritcle? Nicholas Weaver: “The system’s security is fragile, however, and the economic model behind bitcoin is, well, crazy stupid.”

Shameless plug: I am working on an Electrum plugin called "Coinbalance" that does this exact thing. After you send some coins, it pops a window that says "Rebuy X BTC?" If you click yes, it send you off to Coinbase to rebuy.
You can check it out here:  . Currently, you will have to build from source, which is easiest to do on a Linux machine. Once it's added to the main client, it should be easier to use.

Other than accepting BTC, they may also be interested in selling mining hardware. I'm sure many people would like to buy their mining hardware from a trusted source.

The argument with 4 miners at 25% does not hold in practice. Realistically, one of the 4 sets of miners will have a slight edge over the others, and therefore have a corresponding edge in their profit. As time goes on, profit maximizing miners will join the largest pool.

Nothing on the "About Us" page directly claims any association with the Federal Reserve, although it tries to imply it.
The domain is .org, not .gov.
Also, a related site frbservices.org links to this document, and it appears to be a private company with a sales team (see
