Great to see the donations flowing for something who obviously didn't deserve his life being turned upside down. Not since Satoshi was incorrectly linked to silkroad by Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir have i seen such shoddy journalism. My only suggestion would be possibly getting him at least some of the money early so that he is able to make a decision on legal action sooner rather than later.

i've seen similar posts so many times over the last year, at first it was under 1 grand is a bargain, then under $700, then under $500 etc etc. Noone can tell you whethor or not it will be a good investment, but surely it's best to wait until it hits bottom then buy after it starts rising

or it was a red herring

I think it's an error of judgement to back it 100% like Gavin initially did/still is. After verifying it they should have just stated what they saw and in what conditions and how it's not 100% proof due to dns poisoning on the wifi or something similar downloading a modified client. Also Gavin saying he was virtually certain just by talking to him from his language isn't going to look good when hes wrong.

No, i think people found out the email linked to the account was hacked and they just recovered the account

Social engineering it seems. Gavin was convinced that he was Satoshi before he saw evidence which made him blind to any kind of manipulation. How it was faked, who cares, fake wifi, modified pc it doesn't matter. Once CW had Gavin believing he was Satoshi, Gavin would have been more interested in Craig Wright than scrutinizing the evidence, especially when CW would have been down playing the evidence saying it was just a sample of what he was about to make public. Gavin was led to believe what he saw was about to be made public so he didn't see any reason for Wright to fake it which was a big mistake.
Of course this is all just speculation based on Gavins comments.

Yea or maybe the homeless guy who resides a few blocks from me is Satoshi. I mean what better way to hide your identity and avoid being hacked than to be homeless right? He even hasnt planted fake evidence or tried to fool people into thinking he is satoshi so he has one up on Craig wright!
Honestly these conspiracy theories are ridiculous, theres zero legitimate reasons to believe cw is satoshi and 10+ to realize hes not. It's like 1/4 of this sub could catch someone in the act of robbing them and would just speculate maybe his guy isnt robbing me, maybe hes santa.
