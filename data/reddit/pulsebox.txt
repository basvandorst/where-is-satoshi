Thats true, we know what addresses the coins are on, but we have no idea who is in control (has the Key) of the addresses.

The difference in this case is that his 'books' are out in the open, you can see how hes paying out. and so far he's kept his promises. But a warning to those reading this! he can stop giving out at any moment and you lose it all!

This might be because of the 0.6% fee Mt.Gox charges, since plus500 makes their money on the spread.

While small sells won't have much effect on the price of bitcoin, if someone wanted to sell a lot they would have to sell for less than the current price to sell all the bitcoin they wanted to.

yeah its not obvious, they call it granularity. an example with gold is one thats ok about it, but eventually you get small enough that you can't see the gold amounts being traded. whereas dollars don't physically go lower than a cent.

If you really want to buy shares you could put it into a  account and then buy some cheap shares, though most of the good shares are worth a couple of bob and you could lose all your money in an instant if the companys fail.

I feel like they would be fine with it, its a traditional service, obviously in the old days they would of expected people to turn up with stacks of coins.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:08:00
What about LTC? :P
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:53:03
the owner of the currency has to be responsible for everything that happens with it, including reporting to the government all large trades who and how much. this would obviously be impossible with bitcoin therefore you would be arrested. at least thats the gist i got.
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:41:13
Less publicity equals less interest in joining right now, which may lower prices, due to less demand, or just more stable prices. Nothing that will stop bitcoin, just wont be rising unequivocally.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:05:46
If the bitcoins are in an address no one owns, then its likely that no one will ever own those coins again. Ever.

If it was a ddos they would still be online but often dropping connections, as of right now they are totally down. So its not likely to be a ddos.

You can accept unconfirmed payments instantly if you have a system checking for double spending. By the time they get around to accepting bitcoin that system will be commonplace.

If its more expensive then people will use smaller amounts of it to trade with, theres nothing stopping someone from buying less than a bitcoin.
Lets say someone has $10, if it rises to the price of $1000 per bitcoin, then that person will simply buy 0.001 bitcoin. Theres no intrinsic reason that bitcoin will be harder to use when it rises in price, people will just trade with smaller amounts, just as they do today compared to last year.
tl;dr You can divide bitcoins forever.

Cloudflare is a fix for most websites because it serves a cached copy of the webpage. It can also deal with one form of ddos, as this is a tougher ddos and mtgox can't serve cached webpages, they don't have much backup.

@_date: 2013-04-22 21:39:46
No thats the optional fee, there is an inbuilt anti dos system that forces recently traded coins and or small trades to pay a fee to make dosing prohibitively expensive.

* "but would that then mean a lower rate of inflation"
No, since they create blocks twice as fast and 4 times as fast, meaning they have twice the inflation and 4 times the inflation. More blocks = more coins.

Lots of great points, i'd like to add to your argument about the following quote from the article.


Why? because they ***need*** that car to get to work, without it they can't work, same goes with a lot of things. People don't generally spend most of their money on things they want they spend it on things they need. (especially if they are on low incomes). I'm not exactly going to stop spending 20% of my income on food. The same goes for the shop i'm buying from, they put the prices down of goods because they spent 'less' money getting them, and so on. And i'm all for empowering the less wealthy.

I think its important that they saw him doing something with the bitcoins. You could do the same by showing something that you just bought with bitcoins, then explain what bitcoins are when they inevitably ask what they are. they are more likely to put in effort into understanding since they asked the question.
@_date: 2013-06-15 07:18:37
Nice. I really find that insightful. Thank you for sharing your question.
@_date: 2013-06-02 11:18:36
They could begin by working with bitpay to accept deposits to bank accounts with bitcoin, that is quickly sold for the dollar value. So in effect you deposit bitcoin and dollars go into your account (one way). That way they don't need to be registered as a money transmitter.
Its a small step, but one that would benefit everybody, since they get to be the first bank to accept bitcoin. Even if they don't actually hold any bitcoin.

Avalon didn't have the finances to simply buy 400 machines off the bat. Its also cheaper per machine if many are produced in a batch, they used the funding from the orders to make each machine. This would also allow them to keep a few personally at much less of the cost.

Even if they start building the systems now, i cant imagine them gaining acceptance widely enough unless they can get a majority of banks to join them. So we should still be in business.
