I'm one of the early adopters and enthusiasts as well. I've used crypto to trade before, I have knowledge on how bitcoin as well as a few other alts work and I'm happy to look into a particular one if needed. I've also looked into mining, but never got into it due to the costs for equipment and electricity prices. I'm not a coder, but I don't think you have to be one in order to understand and explain how cryptocurrencies work. If you're interested send me a PM and let me know what you have in mind.

Outdated sorry. Mining BTC with gpus is basically flushing your money down the toilet. You could mine ASIC resistant crypto like ETH and then convert that or mine some shitcoin and hodl hoping it goes up in price. Either way if you don't have like 4-5k USD to invest, really cheap electricity and good technical expertise to maintain the rig I would advise against it.

I think it just settled. The people who wanted to buy in already did so, those who panicked and wanted to get out are out. Anyone that wants to use it to trade it for something else probably just buys the amount that they need with Fiat currency.

It's basically stabilised at around 11k USD/btc for the past few weeks. You tell me if it's dying.

If it ever becomes a world currency it'll promote spending, because you'll be payed in it in exchange for goods and services and you'll want to use it to acquire other goods or services. The only exception is that you won't be able to buy something if you don't have enough funds, no one's going to be able to make fake bitcoins and no one's going to be able to make more bitcoins.
If I have a bone to pick with the current economical system is that encouraging spending is actually doing more harm than good right now. It was good for when we needed rapid growth, but nowadays people are just becoming reckless. Governments make more money and banks loan money that doesn't exist, then nobody can repay it so everyone panics and they stop making more money and loaning money, which results in a financial crisis as nobody is able to pay their debts. 
Regarding the 0.1 usd-100usd fluctuations I honestly believe my 0.00013 Bitcoin or whatever amount will then be worth 5GBP will eventually end up being worth a pint.

Feels bad man. Imo if you ever need to keep your crypto on your pc always use one that's been wiped clean and kept offline unless you're currently using it for transactions. Most importantly don't ever ever use it for any other purpose and don't install any crap or put any cds/dvds/usbs into it.

Where did you find your graph? I'm look at the S&amp;P500 and it's 400 in 1991 and 3087 today. 7.5x so still better than gold.
Honestly the real order is:
Btc at 1$ &gt;&gt; Equities &gt;&gt; Bonds &gt;&gt; Gold
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:03:24
I'm seriously never going to own any gold. It doesn't have a coupon attached to it, it doesn't pay interest and it doesn't pay a dividend. It just sits there being pretty and if you take it out of the vault it can easily be stolen. Try paying with tiny gold bars and on top of looking like a retard it also makes the 5$ wrench attack much more likely to happen.
@_date: 2019-11-05 13:44:12
Lol 250k in bitcoin is dumb, but the halvening is next year so your gamble might pay off. At least don't sell at a loss. You should've probably cost averaged your buy ins. I hope you did.
Imo 400k into real estate, 90-95k into stocks and 5-10k into risky assets like btc would've been better. Even if real estate prices go to shit you still get rent.
Buy some apartments, rent them and live off the cash flow. For stocks you just buy companies that are likely to still be here in 10 years time and pay good dividends. If they are close to having a monopoly even better...or you could just buy multiples ones from the same sector. Keep income from dividends and don't touch the stocks for 10-20 years.
That's it, you won the game. 
The other option is 60% stocks and 40% bonds, but you have to educate yourself to actively manage them and use option contracts to protect yourself from losses.

DJIA in 1990 is around 2740. DJIA today is around 27600. 10x return.
Gold 1990 is around 400USD/oz. Gold today is around 1500USD/oz. 3.75x return.
Your information is wrong.
Look at the charts and don't listen to Peter Schiff. He was right about the 2018 bear market, but he's usually full of shit so he can sell you gold. If you listen to him long enough you'll notice he's always yelling about a recession. Even a broke clock shows the right time twice per day.
Bitcoin was by far the best. We'll have to wait for the halvening to see if history repeats itself. I personally own enough bitcoin. If equities can beat gold while going through multiple recessions and also pay dividends I find gold utterly pointless.
@_date: 2019-11-06 08:07:43
I think it's unfair that stocks aren't listed. I would pick stocks if I'm allowed to choose the companies. Other than that I'd pick treasury bonds for the nice trickle of passive income. Gold &amp; btc don't pay coupons or dividends.

The rich don't pay taxes anyway and they do it legally. So long as you own a business you can spend money to make money before you have to pay any taxes. That's what most of them do and theoretically speaking they don't have any money, because they always reinvest it. You're going about things the wrong way.
What bitcoin solves (the double spend problem) is actually what the financial system uses to not fall apart. Money's all an illusion.
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:31:03
God damn it. I'm in this shit for the long run. Lower price means I can buy more bitcoin for less FIAT, Higher price means I have more buying power with my bitcoin. This is a win/win scenario in my book.
Gotta make a new meme for upvotes now: All Hail Satoshi Nakamoto God Emperor of Mankind. There will be a day when you can buy bread with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-24 22:54:44
Happened to me as well, but I wiped everything in time to not lose my bitcoin and instead ended up with most of my files being encrypted. I've lost a few things like some pictures that had emotional value if anything, but I guess I'll just have to live with the memories.

Wonder if it's more profitable for miners to sell now or hodl their earnings until late 2018/early 2019. I assume most have their expenses covered a year in advance.
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:58:51
Theoretically bitcoin supply is going up, but at an exponentially lower pace when compared to Fiat. Bitcoin is capped, Fiat isn't. 
Add to that the number of initial bitcoin adopters that lost their wallet keys and the bitcoin total supply is even lower. Meanwhile more credit is being created and more money constantly printed. 
Not to mention the "hodl" consensus, which is basically agreeing to not sell for worthless Fiat.
So the longer this goes on the more crappy pieces of paper you'll need to get to trade in for 1 btc.
Personally, I'm not buying more unless there's another huge crash and I'm holding what I have until I can trade it for a house. Might be 10 years, but it's still better than a mortgage.
It's interesting times we live in. We have government money (Fiat), private money in development (that crap to be issued by that super trustworthy company that I'm not going to name), gold &amp; silver (basically nature's money) and bitcoin (the people's money).
Currently everyone accepts Fiat, because the consensus is that most people still trust governments. Some might accept gold &amp; silver, but it's not that easy to transfer or trade and it also requires some form of government to work.
We'll just have to see if the consensus changes.
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:14:29
Purely because it would be easier for someone to steal it.
You only really have two options: store it somewhere yourself or have someone else store it in a safe.
No government means there's no one to stop someone else from robbing you and no reason for the person storing your gold to ever give it back.
We'd just all rely on people making decission based on a moral compas. As far as I've seen it most people are just guided by what's legal, not by what's right or ethical.
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:40:01
So approx. 18 trillion $ in marketcap. US GDP is around 20 trillion $, China I think around 14 trillion. Seems unlikely that so much money is going to flow into bitcoin. I'd vote for 40-45k max after the next halvening and then 20-30k after the correction. And people will be screaming btc is dead once it drops to around 20k.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:17:31
It might, but only if our glorious EU leaders will realise China's basically not buying anything from the EU and just selling us underpriced crap we don't need purely based on the fact that they can govern their workers in a tyranical fashion and not give a crap about ethics, the environment or anything else for that matter.
If you look at EUR/CNY over the past 10 years it's pretty obvious where the money has been flowing to. This is definitely not sustainable.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:06:09
I don't think there's going to be this massive shift towards it. Whoever is investing using traditional methods is either going to be buying gold or shorting the markets to make a profit.
If things really go to shit however then bitcoin's a pretty good hedge against recession. It has no intrinsic value other than the fact that you can give it to someone else i.e. liquidity. Liquidity is needed during recessions.
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:27:46

Lets assume they don't both lose out and only the seller gets punished. You find a rival business. Buy something from them. They deliver. You don't confirm and claim they cheated. They lose money. Repeat until there's no more competition.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think lose lose is the best way of getting everyone to cooperate.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:57:59
Yeah, I know. I think the market will be able to decide when we'll be able to goods in BTC and pay salaries without having to convert to Fiat. Think of it. If you can buy things directly in BTC you can pay wages in BTC.
I think if this becomes real the initial prices will be linked to the Fiat price, but once competition kicks in we'll probably see some price stabilization.

There are other hidden taxes though that essentially get added on top of pretty much everything you buy.
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:34:16
There isn't for most people. I'd say like 1-2% will probably be able to find a way to be independent and make money on their own. If you can sell something you'll eventually have enough to do whatever you want and not care about their petty politics. The trick right now is to do it with as few employees as possible unless the system changes.
The system will never collapse as long as there's people out there that refuse to take responsibility and control of their own lives, because the government caters to them. The only option is to eventually live outside it.

1. I have basic human needs like paying rent and not dying of hunger. Apparently I wasn't smart enough for anything else and this was the only job that payed everything. I told you the government fucked 90% of the private sector here.
2. It's temporary. I started a side business that was almost 0 investment money wise and lots of investment time wise.
3. Technically I'm stealing my money back as well and for what it's worth I actually do get shit done at work. There's some older people that've been working that job for 20-30 years and they just sit around drinking coffee because it's almost impossible to legally fire them.
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:11:00
Taxation is theft anyway. Having up to 40-50% taxes then wondering why no one is innovating and why the economy's slowing down is just government hypocrisy. 
As a random thing. I work in the government somewhere in the EU and I'm not telling you where. Employers are obligated to withhold taxes from their employees. The total amount is around a flat 42% for everyone. What that essentially means is it would cost you 10$ to pay someone 5.8$/h. 
Employers are reluctant to hire when they could just do the work themselves or pay a few people for 1-2h overtime daily. Lots of people don't work, because it's become impossible for most employers to pay above min wage and min wage is pretty shit here. Government handouts are about the same and require less effort.
Every time they raise minimum wage to motivate people to work small businesses start laying people off, because they can't afford to pay them. The result is there's now more people competing for less jobs.
It's a shitshow.
EDIT: I'm retarded, initially wrote 6.8 instead of 5.8$, because I can't do math.

You misunderstood what I said. They can pay minimum wage. The problem is minimum wage is rarely livable unless you have help from relatives or are able to grow your own food or have a second job or something along those lines. 
I work for the state and something like two thirds of state employees do absolutely nothing the entire day. 20% of taxes go towards healthcare and there's about a 95% chance that you'll get an infection if you ever get hospitalized here. Private healthcare works perfectly, but you have to pay for it.
If a system is failing it isn't that complicated to lower taxes and at least redirect that extra money to the employees. There's no point in keeping a broken machine running unless you want to syphon money through it.

Since bitcoin was initially released it went up from being worth 1 USD to being worth a couple thousand. That took years. This is a long term investment.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:25:07
Because we're not using it as currency. It's only useful as an investment right now. You can't purchase much with it right now.
I still think it's still a great investment for 10 years ahead. The price will drop for a bit. Just enjoy being able to get bitcoins at a discount.
When the next recession comes along we'll have the same problem as in every financial crisis: "Access to capital will become a problem.". But since it's a finite resource bitcoin is in fact capital.
Money just like bitcoin has no inherent value whatsoever. Think of it as a system of motivational votes that helps everyone get work done so that they can trade their goods or services for other goods or services. That's what money accomplishes. If access to money becomes a problem then bitcoin will flourish.
As of right now bitcoin is up by a couple thousand USD compared to when it was first released. That took years. I think we're safe as long as it doesn't drop to 0.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:53:57
So why not sell your bitcoin, unsubscribe and get out of here? Unless you're waiting to buy it from those that decide to sell.
I think it has a future. If it goes to zero it means I was wrong and I lost some money. Big fucking deal. Across the entire year I won't even feel that -2%. I'm ok with losing all of it.

I don't see why you couldn't have a cash register and also accept bitcoin. It's just that the two things would work separately. Those who want to pay with cash pay with cash. Those who want to pay in bitcoin pay in bitcoin. Those who want to use cards pay with cards.
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:42:37
I don't think bitcoin is going to magically dissapear in the next years. I also don't think any sort of transition towards bitcoin only use can happen so fast that there is absolutely no period of coexistance. That's just not how adoption works. 
If you look at smartphones vs the old phones that still had buttons for example there was definitely a period of coexistance when smartphones originally started appearing. You can still go back to the Legacy Nokia 3310 phones (the indestructible ones) if you manage to find one and don't need any of the advanced functions of the new phones. I'm not sure if anyone ever measured how long it took for almost everyone to upgrade in a given country. The point is I view bitcoin as an upgrade to the original system. 
I don't care about political implications, because I believe that bitcoin can be used by anyone regardless of their political views and I hope that it's going to stay that way. I think we've had politics hinder progress for far too long.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:31:02

Unless you really need the money hodl until the next halvening imo. Usually it doubles in value.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:28:16
Just as a side note. Other currencies aren't backed by gold either. This problem isn't US wide, it's world-wide. The only thing Fiat is backed by is the reputation of the country that issued it. 
The better the quality of life is perceived to be in your country the more likely people are willing to move there either on a temporary or permanent basis both resulting in them bringing money in and increasing the power of your currency.
The actual quality of life doesn't even matter. It's all about who can put on the best show, which is where politics comes in. Now if the banks got the fuck out of politics and stopped messing with the system by printing new money or loaning money that doesn't exist I personally think this little game is productive in the long term. It breeds competition, it forces both political leaders and citizens to work on improving the quality of life in their countries. At some point it would even out and no place would be shit to live.
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:01:55
I'm not even talking about 10% or 15% or 25%. Right now there's no incentive towards contributing to society. There's only the fear of what's going to happen if you don't pay your taxes. I think funding services like that out of our own free will would work a lot better. 
For every person that doesn't want to contribute there's always someone like the guy with the pineapple fund so all in all it balances out. And if they don't contribute they pretty much just exiled themselves from society already.
I still believe most of us can agree on what we'd want to accomplish on a community level and what we'd want to leave for future generations. We can't do that if someone else owns our money.
Take blockchain into account as well and there's no more room for politicians to say: "Oh, we didn't have enough funds.". We could all see how many funds were allocated to that address for that specific project.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:37:56
We're in the early adoption stages. Anyway even for the select few that refuse to buy in right now they'll still have the option of doing so later on. I mean yes you lose out on some potential value, but it doesn't really punish people that much. You also still have the option of getting payed in bitcoin or selling stuff for bitcoin later on. It's not like we're changing the fundamental ways to earn and transact money. We're just getting rid of the middlemen that want to get ahead in life by cheating. To make matters worse they're even using their resources to actively try to cause more chaos. Well it's more like our resources that they're using and that's why I think we should take back control. That way they can't cause a problem and then magically show up with the solution pretending they're the hero.
I don't think any new coins stand a chance to be honest and that's mainly because they lack a good dev team and a proper reputation. Their coins can promise to survive anything, but bitcoin's already done most of that. Why change something if it works?

I think altcoins were popular for two reasons:
- People were looking for the new bitcoin and expecting 10x-1000x fold gains as you mentioned.
- The short period of very high transaction fees and slow bitcoin transaction speed made people more likely to switch to alts so that they could benefit from faster transactions and lower fees.
I honestly don't think there's any point in keeping altcoins. I can see some of the more popular ones still remaining. There are merchants that accept dash, litecoin, monero and bitcoin cash alongside bitcoin. Ethereum will probably remain a thing as it's resistant to ASIC mining. This basically means people who can't afford antminers will always be able to mine ether and then trade it for bitcoin meaning it's always going to have value. Litecoin's probably always going to be a thing as well just because of the name and being among the first altcoins. Dogecoin might stay as well. I mean it's got a cute dog as an image, people love it and it can be used to tip others on reddit. It's a niche market, but I don't see it going away.
Anything else is going to have to be truly revolutionary or fill in a very niche role to have any impact right now.

There's no path, no milestones, no political interest behind bitcoin, no ruling 1%, no need for war. We are simply improving the technology and syphoning funds from the banking system. The more of our funds are in bitcoin, the less available funds they have to cause chaos in the world.
Fiat will most likely not dissapear, but I believe most of it will eventually remain in cash only and will only be used for small purchases.
We're just getting started. If LN is fully implemented it will change bitcoin completely and allow most merchants to accept bitcoin. Once we can accept payments in bitcoin and pay employees in bitcoin we're finally independent from the banking system. 
We're just starting off. This will likely take 10 or 20 years.

Why not? It means businesses can start accepting crypto as well. Right now if you pay for a service in crypto you first need to go through the bank and buy it unless you're a very early adopter that happens to own crypto. On the other hand since very few businesses accept crypto the other person will likely have to go through the bank again in order to cash out that crypto if they intend on spending it.
If we actually use it as currency we don't have to go through the banks over and over.

I can't agree enough on this. It used to be that if something happened to your home the local community would help you out. Nowadays it's just some dude in a suit that comes to check whether your case fits the criteria that they use to determine whether they should siphon funds from all the other contributors in order to pay for your damages.


People don't like responsibility for their mistakes. I'm a little concerned that even if everything's provided to them society is still going to fail if nobody wants to take risks, assume responsibility and try to innovate.


Definitely. The best way to keep your bitcoin safe is not mentioning it. Lots of people like to brag about how much they own. Do that with bitcoin and everyone's trying to take it. Honestly it's the same as not walking around with 10000 USD in cash on you. Or if you really must do it just make sure you fit in and nobody knows you have it. Common sense isn't that common anymore.
Do you think a guide on bitcoin safety would help out? Actually do you think the average person would even read it? I think that's the problem,. nobody reads anymore.

Guys we need to either start selling bitcoin in person or move towards decentralized exchanges. 
We can't have them take over bitcoin.
Please take your coin out of exchanges. There's no get rich quick scheme involving bitcoin. There's a get even richer scheme for those that already own 99% of the money.
Keeping your coins in exchanges is like playing poker vs someone that has 1000x or more over your stack. Sure you might get lucky and win big a few times, but 99% of the times you'll lose.
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:40:41
It'll self-destruct. Honestly, I think that it was estimated to be around 2140 when all 21kk coins get released so unless we figure out something fast we'll all be too dead to worry about it.
Why would you need it to expand? Even if there is only 1 bitcoin left the whole system would work just as fine. I still doubt so many people would lose access to their wallets to allow that to happen.
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:37:14
Thank you for reading my mind. Based on the 2008 financial crisis I'd be a lot more willing to take a chance going down the bitcoin route. At least that way there's always hope that it's going to bounce back or be worth more vs the alternative that can be summarized as following: "All your loans will be up by 50% and all your money will be worth 50% less and there's a 0% chance that things will ever go back to the way they used to be."

If I can buy something in bitcoin from people I gladly do it every chance I get. Not everyone will consider accepting it, but I'm happy to teach the ones that do how to use it.
I think I spend like 30-40% of it and then restock whenever FUDers try to crash the market. It's funny how they're trying to harm it, but they just end up giving me more value for my money.
Make sure you tell people to use it as currency or HODL it and forget about it for a few years rather than try to sell it for Fiat or else it defeats the purpose.

If he already made a bit of money out of selling VHS tapes until DVDs started coming out he probably thought that particular stash of VHS tapes was worth losing.

If it's worthless you throw it away and move on focusing on the other ones.

I'm going to play devil's advocate, but as long as bitcoin is treated as an asset (which it technically is since overall adoption is still very low and the closest comparison we have for it is gold) you don't really need to play any taxes on it. 
If you sell something and you get bitcoin for it you don't need to pay taxes on it. You can trade the bitcoin for goods or sell it for Fiat. If you sell it for Fiat you need to pay taxes based on how much you sold the bitcoin for. I think this makes sense since it takes into account the volatility of bitcoin as well.
I think there's always going to be someone selling bitcoin for Fiat so in the end the taxes for it are payed. If bitcoin floats around between 10-20 people or small business before that happens I don't see a problem with it. It means the economy is improving and most of those people will sell something that's usefull to others. In the end everyone that uses bitcoin benefits from it.
As of right now I doubt bitcoin purchases account for even 1% of total sells in any given business that accepts bitcoin. If I were to guess I'd say that if you have a business that accepts bitcoin you'd probably have like 0.25-0.5% of your earnings in bitcoin. Compared to your earnings in fiat that amount is simply irrelevant.
If it ever gets to the point that 10, 20 or 50 years in the future bitcoin overtakes fiat and everyone is payed in bitcoin we'd probably have a new system where you send part of your bitcoins to fund certain projects either worldwide or within smaller communities. Now you'd probably say that this way no projects are ever funded, but honestly I think people would just fund the projects they find usefull. In a way we'd have proper democracy.

Buying low and selling/spending high is the way to go if you're in it for the money. However doing so requires quite a lot of risk. It's up to you how much you're comfortable with. Investment isn't for the risk averse. 90% of people are very risk averse.

If the conspiracy thing is right the whales are funneling infinite fiat into crypto to keep it down. They're trying to short the market to push the prices down in the hopes that people will sell so that they can buy more. They're actually losing money by doing this and due to bitcoin being a finite resource it is impossible to keep this attack continuously even if they are able to funnel infinite money into it. Fiat can be printed indefinitely, but there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. There's basically a 100% chance that bitcoin will recover.
At some point they will be unable to buy more and they will have to accept their losses. Oddly enough the whales believe in bitcoin a lot more than the rest of us if they're willing to lose so much money in order to acquire most of the available bitcoins.
Bitcoin is a long term investment. It's a deflationary currency. People are buying into it either for long term investment that will give a return in 5-10 years or because they believe that most countries will eventually transition from fiat to bitcoin which is again a long term investment.
You can do three things: buy and wait patiently, buy and instantly spend bitcoin to purchase goods to increase adoption or get out. 
Bitcoin is so volatile it could be worth 1 USD or 18k tomorrow. You have to be ok with the chance of losing everything. This is partly due to adoption being low. I would not use stop losses. You're either in it for the long run or you're out. It sounds like you have a pretty risk averse mentallity. I don't think trading crypto is a good idea for you.
This market is definitely not for regular people. The whales have giant balls, infinite stashes of money and they do not give a shit. All they care about is profit or getting more bitcoin. If they have to shake everyone's faith in bitcoin to buy more at a lower price they will use everything they can to do so...even if it means it might destroy bitcoin in the process. If they end up losing all that money they do not give a shit. I believe this is who you're dealing with.

Well if you're buying big things in bitcoin and not paying taxes you're basically asking for it. I don't honestly believe bitcoin was made to buy big things. Again if you're into trading and you buy low then sell when it goes up it's just common sense that you have to pay taxes on that.
Bitcoin's a lot more efficient in buying small stuff. I think it's essentialy made for day to day purchases like groceries. If we still bought our food from local markets I can say for sure that people there would definitely accept bitcoin. Then they'd probably spend it for something else that's reasonably close in price. 
I think you could realistically survive on bitcoin without raising an eye. You wouldn't be rich though, actually not even close to that. The moment you want to buy a house or a car with it is the moment you have to pay taxes. I just don't think bitcoin was made for buying houses. I think it was made for buying pizza, groceries or getting a haircut or whatever. Or you could just donate it to help those living in poverty.
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:04:12
I don't actually know how it works in the US. This is what they said about it in the UK. Honestly if you're so panicky about taxes just get out of bitcoin. The reason it's unregulated is because compared to other markets it's pretty much insignificant right now.

Or they use what they have and start small focusing on what they know they can accomplish. They save up, make plans and if the plans pay off they take the money and reinvest it over and over into greater projects.
I don't think there's such a thing as good debt. If somehow your plans don't pay off not only do you lose the money, but you also have to pay it back with interest.

I agree that normies aren't buying it, but most of them don't even understand that you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. Oddly enough the lower the price goes the more likely normies are to buy some since the risk is lower. Most of these people will invest more than they can afford to lose so you have to keep that in mind.
Miners can't keep selling forever though. At some point they'll have to either stop mining, hodl until prices increase again or spend what they earn on other goods.  If they keep blindly selling forever bitcoin will drop so low that they can't cover electricity and maintainance costs. I don't think miners have an interest in shutting down their own business.

If 800k people browsing this subreddit and using crypto are going to make the whole financial system collapse then it deserves to burn.
On the topic of the 2008 crisis. You're right, the people were the ones that payed for it and it was the banks that caused it for their own personal gains. Guess what happens if you can't pay the loans you took? The banks take everything from you.
People don't know this, but in most of Eastern Europe prior to the 2008 crisis all the banks were only offering loans in CHF. So if you wanted to get a house with a mortage like all the US folk seem to be doing you needed to get the loan in CHF or move to a different country. Take a look at the CHF to EUR chart from 2008 onward and see what happened after 2008. Guess what? Even though it was worth more you still had to pay the same amount of CHF back. Enjoy your loans being up by 20% due to market manipulation. 
You do have a very US centric view. My family lost quite a lot in that period and it wasn't due to crypto or due to what 99% of the people were doing. It was due to market manipulation and a select greedy few. If we all had the same knowledge about banks and financial systems 10 years ago we wouldn't have had a problem, but I was pretty fucking young and most of us in Eastern Europe aren't that well educated anyway. 
The actual fact is that at least in most of Europe the government doesn't do anything useful other than collect taxes and not help you when banks are pulling this kind of shit. The banks are just a necessary evil as it's the only way to remember who owns what. Now that we have blockchain technology they stopped being so necessary. At the very least I hope they have some fucking competition. 
Personally this is a war for me. Fool me once shame on me. Don't ask me to trust that person or institution a second time because it is not happening. This isn't coming from a moral high ground. Crypto promises a lot more than banks ever did and you don't need to trust anything or anyone to use it.

Doesn't surprise me that it happened. There was bound to be resistance at some point. This was inevitable. It was only a matter of time. All the weak hands that kept panicking about bitcoin dipping got shaken out. The ones left were the true believers who will never sell for Fiat and the ones who are in it for the long term who probably aren't selling until the next reward halvening.
Doesn't necessarily mean shorting will stop. We're just seeing weak hands being shaken out on both sides. This is essentially starting to feel like one big game of chicken.

I'm talking about having a job and using 1-2% of the money to buy bitcoin and then using some of that for small local purchases. Again in the UK whenever you get payed part of that goes towards taxes directly before it even arrives in your bank account. There's no option of not paying income tax.
Now some of those small business can essentially survive on bitcoin transactions if they choose to do so and I personally don't care. If they sell the bitcoin they have to pay income tax.
I don't actually have a business so I can't accept bitcoin unless it's a voluntary donation. I don't sell for Fiat and I will never do so. There's no reason to go to prison for that. The capital gain laws only apply if you are selling for Fiat at a profit here. I pour a small percentage of Fiat into bitcoin when I can afford to and then spend it half of it on actual goods or services. Whether my buying power increases or decreases is actually almost impossible to tell with how volatile crypto is anyway. Generally it stays almost the same maybe within a 0.05% range since whatever I want to spend I do so almost immediately.
If I had a business and I would accept bitcoin I'd probably just hodl that small amount of bitcoin as a future 10-15 year investment. There's no point in selling a tiny amount of bitcoin for a 5% profit and I doubt people would be lining up to pay in bitcoin anyway. 
Also by that logic some of my bitcoin is worth less now. There are no capital gains whatsoever.

Make a localbitcoins account, verify it, have some capital to invest and an initial 0.04bitcoin in your localbitcoins wallet. After that all you have to do is buy low and sell high. If you happen to be risk averse I advise against starting this although you do have some protection against price fluctuations if you don't buy too much at once. On the other hand you might also make a bigger profit if you buy more at once and then the price skyrockets the next day. Make sure to check your tax regulations. Bitcoin is an asset. Money earned from trading bitcoin is income.
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:59:33

So how else do you pay taxes other than selling it for Fiat and then paying a percentage of that as your taxes? Nobody even knows how much bitcoin you have or whether you even have any. You can't pay taxex with bitcoin. Up until someone comes up with a legit alternative you either hodl and forget about it or cash out everything. Still I doubt the government cares about your 0.2 bitcoin hodlings compared to the rest of your salary.

I think we can all agree that the overall trend of bitcoin was an increase in value...unless it randomly drops to 100$ or something, but I highly doubt that and I think most people are greedy enough to buy more at that point.

Because people expect it to go up 1200% in 24h and then they see it drop by 2% so they sell everything at a loss driving the price further down. Then they complain that bitcoin isn't "real money".

I think the leading global powers being at a stalemate since they have enough nuclear weapons to obliterate the planet is what's actually preventing World Wars right now. A second central government does nothing usefull in that regard. The only thing it enforces is pointless legislation in other countries without fully understanding the already existing legislation or economical and political situation. Brexit happened because the EU is a sinking ship. Debt is at an all time high and constant printing of Euros will just repeat the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile St. Merkel of the refugees decided to fix the issue by letting anyone into the EU without prior vetting and then demanding that everyone adopt a certain number of the previously mentioned refugees. As a result nobody was able to block entrace to the 1-5% of religious extremists that are responsible for shootings and bombings in Sweden, the attack in Manchester, underage prostitution rings in the UK or 14 year old girls being raped in Germany. What a lovely peaceful society for children to live in. Get the fuck out of here with your EU and your disgusting beaurocrats.

I think there are a few reasons mass adoption hasn't occured. 
The first one is that most people are idiots. Having full control over your money gives you full control to fuck up and lose it forever and there's absolutely no one that can give it back to you. This isn't terribly appealing to the average person.
The second one is that it hasn't been around long enough to be pegged to actual goods. Whatever you're buying in bitcoin you're actually just buying based on the price of those goods in your local currency that's then converted to bitcoin. It'll be interesting to see how it behaves in an economic recession.
Fix these two issues and then we'd have to worry about the government banning it or aresting people for using it.
Other than that I think it would be better if we started using Satoshi instead of Btc. It's easier to say 10k satoshi vs 0.00010000 bitcoin and it's definitely less demanding on my flawed human brain.

So you ask people whether they want 1$ or 8000$ and they say 1$. People are idiots.

Basic changes in supply and demand. I think it'll drop again and bounce back a few more times until the next halvening. I don't know the exact timeframe. 
When the halvening occurs in 2020 bitcoin will again grow exponentially, because you decrease the amount of new bitcoins being mined. Not to mention more and more people that don't do their research manage to lose their keys further decreasing the supply. There will be another correction phase afterwards. Economic cycles repeat themselves.

Get a decent job, pretend you're normal and never buy more than you're willing to lose.

One phone with your holdings locked in a safe and only switched on when transacting from it. Passphrase written on paper and held in 1 or 2 trusted separate locations in case the phone stops working.
Another phone with 40-50$ of bitcoin or whatever you think is a small amount for daily transactions.
If anyone has a better system I'd be happy to read about it.
