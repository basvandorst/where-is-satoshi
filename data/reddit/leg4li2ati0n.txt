The irony is in the fact that we are literally funding terrorist organizations. And by we, I am referring to the U.S. Government.

Lots of great useful information and insight here. Appreciate it, guys. I'm honestly tempted to buy into mtgox right now. I can't see them going out of business, and when they recover there'd be no reason their price wouldn't match up with anyone else's.

Okay, so DHOOM must be considered a Bollywood classic.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:08:19
Sorry dude, argumentinvalid.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:22:49
Would the Dhoom movies count as these?

BitInstant took the ZipZap options, including MoneyGram, offline until they

Yes, but my initial incentive had more to do with dealing with them in a way to merchant with.  I'm looking at this as a type of stock market almost, and trying to weigh my odds on whether or not to get in before it's "too late", or at a point where I could've made much more of an earning if I had invested now as opposed to later.

You think he's done yet?  Watch for more big mini walls (big mini walls, lol), he'll keep the rally going.
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:33:41
Especially when the rally is keeping the rally going.  Back to infinity, sha'll we?!

Please correct me if i'm wrong, but even if everyone were to start buying bitcoins.. is the price not based on the average of the price being bought?  So if all the bitcoins someday did sell out or became extremely scarce, they could still be selling out at whatever the consumers are buying them for correct?  Or is this fallacious logic?

Just blows my mind how these people even think to cash out in the first place, especially anyone following the herd.  facepalm.jpg

I think you're missing the point..
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:01:44
what does it matter?
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:12:03
bitinstant.com too. works instantly, no mtgox verification required. only hindering is the 4% fee, but hey, that'll be covered in a day or two. :p
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:07:38
gox, it doesn't work for any of them though..
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:49:17
LOGIC, PEOPLE?! NOBODY'S GONNA BUY UNTIL THE DUST SETTLES SO STOP FREAKING OUT AND LET THE PRICE GO BACK UP!
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:29:31
Wouldn't anyone who did this be classified as an MSB under FinCEN's regulations?

"we move up now"?

If you're trying to get into bitcoins and this is scaring you away.. don't be a fool.  Now is when you want to buy, because the price is about to soar soon with a deal like this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:10:59
If people could get a brain and stop freaking out and realize if they stop cashing out and the dust settles that the price will fucking soar through the roof with a deal like this. IT'S COMMON FUCKING SENSE.  Stop panicking and let the market do it's job! EVER TAKE AN ECON COURSE?! Called price equilibrium faggots.
