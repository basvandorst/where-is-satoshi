The fame alone and the impact on obtaining a job is enough for a lawsuit  i'd think.
But being Satoshi might not be as significant if there wasn't hundreds of millions of dollars associated with being Satoshi. That is a huge amount of money. There are many reasons that this could impact his life negatively. 
Also if Dorian hasn't reported these assets then I think it's tantamount to accusing Dorian of tax fraud. You could not simply laugh it off if you were under heavy scrutiny from the IRS.

It's somewhat amazing to me that China has some of the biggest speculators of bitcoin when it's quite clear their government will be reluctant to bitcoin. Why is this such a surprise to China when they have to send money to a dudes personal bank account to trade on an exchange?? I don't see how they are so willing to speculate on bitcoin and then tank the price as soon as their government takes another incremental step to avoid their citizens using it.

So miners are actually incentivized for 100% of miners to join one pool. This eliminates luck entirely, instead you earn money directly proportional to your hash rate contribution for each block generated. 
Can we just add a pool layer to the protocol so that we have decentralized pool mining? Would solve the problem..

I definitely agree it has all the monetary properties but also that it might be more profound then that. 
Naval touches on this as well: 
"At the end of the day, currency, language, communication, exchange; these things are all variations of the same thing. I think bitcoin is calling that out." 
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:17:03
Is it possible to also factor in recent block sizes to the recommended transaction fee? My thinking is that could aid in ensuring miners are appropriately compensated when the 1MB limit is removed.

Yeah there's really two facts linking him to Satoshi:
- His middle name + last name is Satoshi Nakamoto
- He (allegedly) responded to a bitcoin question saying "I'm no longer involved in that".
Everything else is circumstantial (he just happens to be somewhat of a programmer, unknown career during timeframe of bitcoin creation, etc.). This is such a tiny amount of evidence (and the second bullet is highly questionable considering he said he was misunderstood).  
Leah apparently did a couple of months worth of "forensic research" for this. Her strategy was to go through possible candidates and eliminate them for one reason or another. She has said there was nothing that could eliminate Dorian so it must be him. 
That is flawed logic to me, the bar for research in journalism seems much lower than most other industries.

I think this is more intuitive:
1 bitcoin contains 1 bit = 100 centibits = 1000 millibits = 1000000 microbits = 100000000 satoshis
The idea that a bitcoin is a monetary unit equal to one bit is really simple and easy. Then that makes the prefix to denoting SI units much easier to handle It's a win win.
We use millimeter, centimeter, etc. so clearly SI units are not too difficult for the general public to use, we just need to have units that are easy to tack on a prefix to.

It's all positive marketing for virtual currencies. Dogecoin kind of makes Bitcoin look more legitimate. So I'm just as much for dogecoin marketing as bitcoin.

You think long term Bitcoin is a bad investment? I don't think this is true unless there is some drastic extinction event of bitcoin. That is possible, but I am willing to put money that doesn't happen.

I don't think they released the technical details but I would guess this uses public key cryptography. This is already used outside the U.S. in Chip and Pin credit cards.

I see your point (and bashco's below). 
Then I do agree it would have an impact to have the name changed. But we are talking about a slight decrease in the slope of the trajectory of the adoption of changetip, not a completely different adoption curve. So maybe the impact is not as great as is being suggested in this thread. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:21:16
I agree with all of you, but it is interesting to know this is possible. It's kind of a ridiculously large amount of power -- if the wrong-doing of the holder of the address was great enough (E.g. Hitler's bitcoin address) then the entire bitcoin world could come together and consent to wipe out their wealth.  Cool thought experiment.

Another good resource on decentralization (and I'd guess helped shape Andreas' points) is Rod Beckstrom's talk about decentralization in nature and how it applies to many things:   
Interestingly i found that from posts on the bitcoin forum years ago.
@_date: 2014-08-24 05:18:56
If, just as a thought experiment, we operate under the premise that Bitcoin is a company (a decentralized autonomous organization), then bitcoins themselves operate similarly to our concept of 'stocks'. 
Ultimately however I think we are trying to categorize Bitcoin into constructs  we have for things today (such as 'pure monetary commodity' or 'stocks'). I don't think those are very accurate terms as we've never seen anything quite like it before. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:39:15
Gavin - How does this differ from the gold standard in your opinion? 
We already experimented with the monetary policies of a 'multinational currency' when multiple nations tied themselves to gold. This caused some of the worst depressions we ever saw. 
I don't grasp what new monetary policies bitcoin brings that weren't tried with the gold standard.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:01:29
Yes it's just that most valuations of bitcoin that I've read (i.e. the recent goldman sachs report) only discuss bitcoin's potential value as a currency of sorts. They don't even discuss it as incentivizing  future applications of blockchain technology, which could end up being where bitcoin attains most of it's value. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:39:47
Wow this is an incredible idea I didn't really think about until this thread. Even if bitcoin the currency is tried and found to be unfit as a useful currency (I.e. using it to buy/purchase things is just not that beneficial or practical on a large scale), Bitcoins will still be very valuable because they will be used to incentivize other applications of the Blockchain technology. 
So really investing in bitcoins is not just an investment in the currency, it's an investment in the value of blockchain technology. Thus, regardless of if economists are right or wrong about bitcoin as a currency, it will have significant value as the blockchain technology is an obvious breakthrough for computer science. 
What am I missing? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:34:58
Yeah this probably makes implementing this in all practicality impossible for an individual or group. Likely a larger entity like the US govt would be slow to react. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:23:36
She did seem to insinuate in subsequent interviews (particularly with Felix Salmon) that they have more evidence that they cannot release. That is interesting for sure, but we can't base our judgement off of potential evidence. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 07:35:40
I see what you are saying. But no one just up and created gold, whereas someone up and created bitcoin. You could consider Satoshi writing the code for bitcoin more or less meaning he was writing the business model for bitcoin.  
Whereas gold just exists as it is natural. If someone planted all the gold in earths crust, then I think we could make the analogy that the person who planted the gold kind of created a self sustaining company out of nothing. 
Now that we've seen this business model, it could be used in more practical scenarios than just currency, right? This is the 'app-coin' idea as I understand it. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:11:47
I don't necessarily agree. 
If you just hear the words "changetip" then yes, it is not clear what that represents. However when most people will hear abut changetip for the first time it will be because they see it in action. In the verification response, changetip says "user x gave user y ZZ amount of bitcoins". It's obvious at that point what the service is doing.

Quick google news search of bitcoin, this crash is not even at the top. I wonder how far it has to fall before the mainstream media picks it up. Maybe that could bring some new money in and help curb the drop. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:57:17


This isn't quite true though. The miners who are supporting the network are being paid, and they are being paid with the token of bitcoins. So in essence the 'contract' is between the miners who support the network, which then the Bitcoin code guarantees they will receive bitcoins as compensation.

This is highly suspect behavior. 
However, Gox has repeatedly shown terrible PR management. Regardless of their actual status, they could've handled every step of this mess better. I think there is a nonzero chance that this is another ill advised PR move. They do have people contemplating a lawsuit against them on bitcoin talk so this could be an action they perceive as protecting themselves.
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:48:38
I think you could make the argument that Bitcoin functions as a company created on an entirely new open source based business model. 
Naval Ravikant makes this argument in a keynote speech he gave recently:
@_date: 2014-03-11 13:23:41
I've been thinking of an analogy for the protocol:
It's basically like email but the total amount of words that can be used is fixed and you can only send the number of words that have been sent to you. You could send however many emails (transactions) to however many people but the total number of words (bitcoins) you used must not be greater than the total number of words sent to you in previous emails. So now words are scarce and are easily transmitted so they display properties of money and have value.
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:14:14
kb, Mb, Gb would be terrible to use as they already reflect common used units of bytes. 
I don't see why the smallest unit should be in bit. Bitcoin was completely arbitrarily placed out 8 decimal places. Now we are saying we should name this arbitrary figure 'bits'. People who are first learning about bitcoin will have another item they will have to learn how many decimal places it goes out to before they would understand how much a unit a 'bit' is worth.
Instead I don't see why we don't have 1 bit = 1 bitcoin  ("1-bit" coin). Then use the metric identifiers to go downward. (centibits, millibits,microbits, or c bits, m bits, u bits). 
@_date: 2014-05-03 14:42:41
Completely agree. Adding another COMPLETELY ARBITRARY unit is another hurdle that people will have to learn. It is NOT intuitive. Any layer of complexity added as a prerequisite for a user to begin using Bitcoin is a bad thing. If you sound it out, it makes sense for a bitcoin to contain one bit:
One bitcoin = One bit coin= One-bit coin 
A "one-bit" coin should be worth 1 bit. Then the metric prefixes sound nicer (centibits, millibits, microbits, Etc.)
Edit: c-bits, m-bits, and u-bits would also work well in this format as mentions below. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:35:37
I think this calls for another layer added on to the bitcoin protocol which adds a P2Pool feature built in. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 08:22:31


Well then I think we need to go back to the definition of a 'company' because I do think this is an important distinction. Satoshi is nearly a billionaire because of this.  There is clearly massive incentive (if it can be done) for entrepreneurs to start decentralized autonomous organizations utilizing some sort of 'app-token' and release it to the world just as Satoshi did with Bitcoin. 
Obviously Bitcoin's main application is money, I'm not disagreeing with you. I am just suggesting you could parallel the process that Bitcoin went through to be created and sustained to a normal company's business model. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:36:35
I think this is misleading.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but that doesn't mean there couldn't be a correlation.
The price follows market psychology. Human psychology has remained the same since last bubble. So unless you think bitcoin adoption has hit critical mass and is beginning to level off, I would expect that the bubbles will tend to follow similar patterns until a drastic event collapses the price or we've tapered off due to mass adoption.

Once again China is reacting to another incremental step by their govt to wash their hands of bitcoin. The Chinese government has made it pretty darn clear the use of bitcoin will not be without significant work. I don't see how Chinese investors are still in the game that are still so willing to overreact to their government taking another step in the same direction. They already have to send money to personal bank acct to get on an exchange, for christs sake.

The general public will not easily distinguish Mb and MB...Practical Example: You are downloading a movie or song and it tells you how many bytes it is and how much it is in bitcoin. Your suggestion is that people will understand that 5 MB refers to bytes and 10 Mb refers to how much they will pay.  Sorry but that is a terrible differentiation and will easily be confused. You'd have to look up which unit is which every time you want to buy something in that genre. God awful.  
I absolutely disagree with your statement that "the smallest unit of all digital currencies should be called a bit". 
Digital currencies are technically infinitely divisible. There isn't a smallest unit. The 8 decimal places of Bitcoin is completely arbitrary. What if at some point we determine we want more decimal points? Then we would need to move the unit of bits even further? That's why it makes sense to have the standard unit of digital currency be the first digit after the decimal and use metric notation to indicate smaller divisibility of that unit.

What is the difficulty with enabling this in comments? Would the ChangeTip app not receive a notification? 
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:23:43
If you sound it out this makes even more sense:
One bitcoin = One bit coin = One-bit coin
A "one-bit" coin should be worth 1 bit. Then the centi/milli/micro prefixes are an easier transition.

He says himself he doesn't understand it, and that people are taking actions different than he was expecting. There isn't much logic behind his reasoning. I think that so many of the arguments against bitcoin are flawed like this, which makes me further believe in it's value. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:05:11
This can be done in fiat currency as well. Actually, I've seen this sort of thing before (MSP airport for example) but the fact it hasn't caught widespread use makes me think it is not something people actually want. If you're at a bar, you are likely interested in interracting socially.

@_date: 2013-12-30 20:05:58
It is accurate but misleading to say the total amount of Bitcoins is fixed. The value a Bitcoin wallet stores is represented as an integer. Where the decimal point is placed is just an arbitrary assignment for human reading. Currently the decimal place is after the first digit, but this could be changed to be after the 6th digit and so on. There is a coded limit of 9 integer slots, so with the decimal currently showing after the first integer, there are 8 decimal places to divide a Bitcoin into. This limit is also arbitrary, and can be changed as necessary, making a Bitcoin infinitely divisible. If all but one Bitcoin was held in people's wallets, an entire economy could still be sustained on it, there would just be very small divisions traded.
