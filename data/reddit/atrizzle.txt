Which part? I made two claims.
@_date: 2018-09-24 20:42:56
I misspoke. To clarify, it was 50% as of 4 days ago, I'm assuming that the number is much higher now. Regardless, &gt; 50% is all that's theoretically needed for safety.
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:50:11
As of Sept 20th (4 days ago at time of writing), over 50% of the hashrate has upgraded. See the notice published by Bitcoin Core:

Hi, happy cake day!
I never claimed that ALL nodes have upgraded, just that mining nodes have upgraded.
My apologies for not including my source in the original comment. See the notice published by Bitcoin Core on Sept 20th, in which they've confirmed that over 50% of mining nodes have upgraded: [


Not that it matters, but you're doing the same thing you accused me of doing. You say that only 21% of nodes have upgraded. What's your source? 
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:19:18
All the miners have upgraded already, so there's no more threat of a chain split.

My favorite moment was when my extended family had a discussion about Bitcoin that lasted hours around the Thanksgiving table. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:10:39
Other people have pointed out that "1 bitcoin" can be divided up into many smaller units. Keep in mind, also, that as bitcoin are lost over time, the _value_ of the remaining bitcoin will go up, as people realize that not as much is available that there used to be. If one day there were only 10 usable bitcoin left, better believe they'll be worth more than $1140 / coin. This is why it "doesn't really matter" that some get lost, the market will adjust.

Read more about UTXOs - Unspent Transaction Outputs.
Every time bitcoin is sent from an address, to an address, one or more UTXOs are destroyed, and one or more new UTXOs are created (based on how many inputs and outputs are part of the transaction). Every node keeps a full set of valid UTXOs, which they update after every block is mined. It's this set of UTXOs which is one of the most valuable part of bitcoin - it's the "state" that everyone in the network agrees upon, which says "these addresses have this much bitcoin available to spend".

You just nod and walk away.
If you have better information than them, use it to your advantage. Bitcoin is a virus that likely won't ever stop spreading. Pandora's box is open. The cat is out of the bag. If they choose not to try to understand it, why force it on them?
They'll figure it out eventually, or they won't, and it will be forced on them by the rest of society. Why worry about them now? Use their ignorance to make a better position for yourself.

Very cool! If sharing a memo with the recipient of a transaction, does DropBit allow the message to be encrypted and placed into the OP\_RETURN field?
I'm considering the scenario in which your API servers go down, as a way to ensure that messages aren't lost. 
Alternatively, what is the client-side backup strategy once a message is received by the recipient?

I didn't realize they were talking about the capital firm until they said "compile a form".
Bitcoin is very unlike any other investment vehicle, I wasn't assuming that they knew that bitcoin itself has no "minimum investment".
@_date: 2019-04-21 14:53:40
There is no minimum investment. That's not how this works.

Mining produces blocks. Blocks contain transaction fees and a coinbase reward which belong to the miner who created the block. Eventually the coinbase reward will go to zero but transaction fees will still be there, as transactions will still be occurring (we hope).

Because the entire blockchain is readable in plain text. There's no encryption. Therefore, each transaction inherently has a history of the previous addresses that the bitcoin has moved through. Now, there are definitely ways for people to introduce pseudo-anonymity into the system, but inherently everything is public.
This is a simplistic example, and not totally 1-to-1 with how Bitcoin works, but imagine that every dollar bill had a history of how it was used. People would likely start to value certain dollars over other dollars. Was this dollar freshly minted, am I the first user of it? Or was this dollar's last transaction used in a large drug deal, or a murder-for-hire? Again, that's not directly how Bitcoin works, but the ideas are similar. Analysis tools can be used to track how certain bitcoins are used over time. That affects fungibility.

"ideologically committed to Bitcoin"
They're taking BTC from the people, giving it to BitPay to turn into USD, then collecting the USD. It's a marketing stunt. I don't know why anyone would voluntarily participate in this.
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:54:53
Bitcoin is most certainly NOT better at fungibility than gold. Limited supply, portability, and divisibility sure, but not fungibility. At least not in its current state.
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:24:53
There is a premium for freshly minted BTC, straight fresh from the coinbase reward, which doesn’t have a history attached to it. Therefore “1000 sats = 1000 sats” isn’t necessarily true. Try sending BTC that was seized from Silk Road to a regulated exchange like Coinbase and see what happens. History matters, and affects fungibility.
Everything else you said I mostly agree with. But fungibility is an issue.

Bitcoin's blockchain, and a few select other public proof-of-work blockchains, are robust, immutable, and censorship-resistant. As I asked someone else in this thread, which blockchain are you referring to? A blockchain as a data structure might be cryptographically secured, but only when that is paired with a large network does it become robust, immutable, and censorship resistant.
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:33:06
Because of the network effect pal
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:28:53
Well, to be fair, the r/btc sub started well before the split, and was created as an outlet to the rampant censorship that was happening on r/bitcoin around discussions of scaling and increasing the block size. It makes sense that the people (myself included) who wanted to explore the ideas of block size increase, who were forced out of r/bitcoin, stuck around in r/btc after the BCH split happened.
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:35:39
Anyone can make something that *looks* kind of like a bitcoin, but it's not a bitcoin. Only actual bitcoin miners on the bitcoin network can make bitcoins, and it's Really Really Hard.
You can paint a rock with gold paint and call it a gold nugget. But it's not gold.

No problem. In general, think of hard/soft forks like this:
A hard fork happens when rules get "relaxed". A soft fork happens when rules become "tightened".
So currently Bitcoin uses 8 decimal places (actually everything is an integer, the decimal places are just for display purposes, so the system is really working on the rule that there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshi -- 21mil\^8 -- but this isn't really relevant for the explanation here).
A soft fork would be like clients all of a sudden choosing to use, say, 4 decimal places. The new bitcoin software would only allow people to send bitcoin denominated down to 4 decimal points -- 1.2345 (which is the same as 1.23450000). All old clients (who can recognize 8 decimal places) would work just fine here, as 4 is just a "tighter" number than 8. Any older client who could deal with a transfer of 1.23456789 could deal with a transfer of 1.23450000.
A hard fork happens when old clients can no longer deal with the changes being introduced, because the rules are "loosened". So if Bitcoin moved to a 10 decimal system, old clients would NOT be able to handle a transfer of 1.2345678901 bitcoin. There are too many numbers there, old clients will choke and see that as invalid, the chain would split with old and new clients using different rule-sets.
Hope this helps.

Which blockchain? You can't just say "the blockchain" without specifying which one.
@_date: 2019-01-15 02:33:35
This isn’t about collectivism, it’s about individuals (with power - government and law enforcement) choosing to monitor specific coins for whatever reason they want, and then using force to stifle their economic value.

I was responding to the question


with an answer which hopefully pointed the poster of that question in the right direction. If you don't understand what coinbase rewards or range proofs are, and you're also interested in understanding how to trust the Monero blockchain, then do some research and start with those search terms.
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:31:04
You can’t change the layer 1 base unit with a soft fork.

Ohio is converting all of the BTC straight into USD at time of payment using BitPay. That sucks.
Also, it seems like paying your taxes with BTC still incurs a taxable event, so that sucks too.
It's good for increased awareness of BTC, but sucks when you actually start to understand the details.
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:25:50
That’s a good question, and one that has answers if you look for them. Start with adding up all of the coinbase rewards. Then look into range proofs.
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:20:20
Forking and cloning the BTC codebase does not affect the BTC network.
Forking the BTC network does not affect the existing BTC network.

@_date: 2019-01-14 21:18:51
\&gt; While BTC is pretty much infinitely divisible
Layer 1 BTC is divisible down to the Satoshi, which is 0.00000001 BTC. It takes extremely minimal effort (just make a transaction) to split up some BTC into any denomination down to that Satoshi unit
\&gt; gold is *exceptionally* divisible as well and certainly far beyond any minimal fiat unit
What does this mean? I'm not a metallurgist but it seems like it would be difficult and time consuming to accurately split up gold.

It happened with Ethereum one time. The ETC/ETH split.
All of the Ethereum tokens you're probably referring to are not forks off of Ethereum, they are simply created on top of the Ethereum network. Ethereum is way more complicated than Bitcoin, users can write code to create new tokens, and embed that code into smart contracts which just get placed in Ethereum's blockchain.

The only time an on-chain transaction would happen is when you open or close a lightning network channel. Once you deposit your BTC to open a channel, all transactions on that channel can happen between you and the node you're connected to, not needing to be recorded on the blockchain. You and the node keep a record of additions/subtractions as you send BTC back and forth, and then only when closing the channel is the difference calculated and recorded on-chain.

No you're right. LN is a bunch of theory (though the tech is interesting) that no one can predict how will play out in real life (via economics and game theory). 
Bigger/dynamically sized blocks are a simpler, more scalable, safer solution in my opinion. I was just trying to explain how LN works. 
Regarding your example, though, it's important to note that a channel between you and Alice does not affect anything between you and Bob. You would need a separate channel with Bob, OR Bob would need a channel open with Alice (and then your business with Bob would go "through" Alice's LN node). 
In the multi-hop scenario, you can imagine how closing your single channel with Alice would just create one transaction on the chain. Bob's information would not be anywhere in that transaction. That would be dealt with when Alice and Bob close their channel.

The difficulty adjusts down as hashrate leaves. The difficulty adjusts up as hashrate enters. There is no more to it than that.
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:47:00
Thanks, the title does make sense after looking at it again. I originally read it as if the OP was saying that hashrate is up BECAUSE difficulty is down, which is not really the correct way to understand the correlation between hashrate and difficulty. But those two statements in the title are actually unrelated, and also both true. So yeah. Ok. Cheers y’all 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:05:32
They likely don't keep all of their BTC at one address. Also, they probably don't care about letting you "verify their holdings".
@_date: 2018-12-22 18:07:09
The difficulty adjustment algorithm is not reliant on the hash rate at the adjustment block. There is no way for the network to measure "current hash rate" reliably, other than looking at statistical heuristics. The difficulty adjustment algorithm actually looks at the average time between blocks over the previous 2015 blocks and adjusts the difficulty up or down depending on if the average time was less than or greater than 10 minutes.

Coins from the genesis UTXO are immovable, but other coins sent to that address (which have different UTXOs) can still be spent by that address.

You don’t need to do anything (can’t do anything, actually), but wait for the transaction to be cleared by the network.
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:29:16
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:55:06
What? No, If difficulty is down that means hash rate is down, too. They’re directly correlated.
The difficulty readjustment (I agree is genius) happens BECAUSE hash rate is changing.
