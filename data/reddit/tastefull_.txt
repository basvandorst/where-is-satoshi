Thats what I thought. In the last hack that was why only their hot wallet was emptied and losses were limited to $5million

This is an old post from July. Why are you posting it?
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:35:56
yes, but better than losing 90% of funds. assuming we can't catch the hacker.

Bitcoin wallet on android. Not working.

page number?
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:41:05
Yep. People seem to be down voting when they disagree on certain subreddits. Results in echochambers.... 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:22:41
Yep.. time to move to r/btc
I'll probably get the shadow ban hammer very soon but idgaf
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:18:18
See he doesn't want to be shadow banned. Me? I don't give a f..
Checkout r/btc it's where the real stuff happens. Enough of the BS mods.

Take care not to reveal your identity. It's like you're sitting on millions and millions of dollars of cash right there in your house. Some unscrupulous people would kill for that sort of money. Be carefull and good luck. :)

when you do buy some (I'm assuming you will, you sound like you can afford to throw some cash around) make sure to store your coins in your own wallet. Not with a online service like coinbase or an exchange. If possible buy something like a trezzor if you will be handling any significant amount of coin. Make a number or paper backups and put them in multiple locations as you may not always remember your password (like me as I never use the passphrase). Put copies in a few locations as the original backup can go missing (mine did and I lost my coin).
tl;dr, do your homework about storing your coin
@_date: 2016-01-22 09:55:27
yes, but this risk will be priced into the price of bitcoin currently. Once issues are resolved, you can bet the price will jump.

Downvote OP, just because there's no traffic jam doesn't mean there isn't any traffic.
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:14:52
Be super careful. DO NOT EVER under ANY circumstances send your bitcoin wallet to anyone else or upload it. If you upload it your bitcoin WILL be stolen.  The important file is usually called wallet.dat It holds the keys to all your bitcoin. Treasure it and keep a backup in a safe location.

So on the space station they would have to sign the transaction with their private keys. Then they will need to broadcast the transaction, or get it down to earth onto the network somehow via usb or via the internet connection. Both will work.

Is this the embrace phase?
Embrace, enhance, extinguish.

Could you not repeatedly post the same question. Yes they move from address A to B. Thats correct.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:47:41
What can I do when they hold the domain name?
bitcoin.com should redirect to bitcoin.org which does everything it needs to.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:04:33
It looks like shit.

If it is an individual they will have their reasons. 50-100BTC is a lot to spend on clogging the network. Either they are super sure what they are doing is for the good of the network or are malicious and determined enough to drop ~20kUSD on this.

Go read about bitcoin's basics. Difficulty always is adjusted so that a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:42:25
Not always

Paypal? Google it, loads of people get ripped of through paypal via chargebacks. You have been warned!!!
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:31:22
It may not go under 1k but a sharp correction is happening atm
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:51:24
I agree. That being said, this is the first time we're bubbling without gox and their bot
@_date: 2016-05-31 07:44:01
you're right &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:46:10
The reasonable and responsible option. I'd go with this. Bitcoin is in the mania mode of a bubble atm (Google it) and will have a correction. Then it will continue to move up or that's it for now and then go way down for a long time. Look at the past graphs and observe the repeating patterns.
@_date: 2015-10-25 06:19:41
Until the time that it is and it moons :P
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:15:54
Don't worry about it. They usually are pessimistic.
@_date: 2016-07-31 04:31:59
just wait.

Use the API. You hook up your program to the API and it can withdraw, deposit, buy sell, do everything you can with your credentials via the API. If you don't know what API is google it :)
