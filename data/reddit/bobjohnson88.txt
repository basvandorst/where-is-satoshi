Why can't you simply use a credit card that doesn't have a foreign transaction fee and get cash from an ATM?

Charles Schwab has never given me trouble for transfers into Coinbase, and offers a quality checking account.

I don't think the mainstream wants a currency whose underpinning is rocked by rival mining pools launching self mining, DDOS, block withholding attacks, etc.

I've asked plenty of newb questions here without issue. Just ask a sensible question and don't be a cock (e.g., start a "petition") and you'll be fine.

People investigating the way the world is use simplifying assumptions in order to get a handle on things. My simplifying assumption is that the model of bitcoin price I described is correct; of course, it isn't really.
Instead of recognizing this, you go on the offensive by implying I don't know jack. Can you engage the issue at hand -- the issue of how an influx of Wall Street money is supposed to take bitcoin to the moon (an oft-repeated assumption on these forums) -- or not?

Wouldn't that result in even less buying pressure for bitcoin, meaning that the Wall Street influx won't result in moon-hood?

Ok, thanks for your and others' input.

No, bitcoin is property, dawg. I'll keep hodling onto it as such, as will many others.

You may be correct, but it's hard to assess your claims without having any of the hard numbers in hand (how much Bloomberg LP has invested in Andreessen, how much of that money is actually exposed to bitcoin).
I simply intended to point out that an incentive exists -- however large or small -- for Bloomberg to spread the "Word" regarding bitcoin. Suggesting that this incentive is the sole reason for Bloomberg's positive coverage was rhetorical flourish on my part.

What does the future hold for that place?
