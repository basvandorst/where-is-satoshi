Shiite..I listened to this thing for 30min. That 30 min of my life I just wasted

Less than 10% of my wealth is in BTC. So if it crashes..not the end of the world. Of all my investments BTC is 100% of the fun. I mean how many times a day do you check what your stocks are doing?

The average joe is 100% idiot. In my line of work I deal with mainly average joe's and the amount of ignorance is shocking.

Bullshit. They just looking at trying to regulate it
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:36:12
I just want to travel. Get into my overlander  and go whatever way the wind is blowing that day. BTC is the ultimate fuckyou money.

TenX or Cryptopay?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:25:27
So true. I have in BTC for a while, one of my customers, total noob. Anyways we are having a chat and his phone tells him the price is going down. Guy just about has a meltdown. Me ...meh

Not value but time. 2020. I will cash out a few of my BTC just because we are retiring. The stocks, bonds and other saving can stay just where they are. I will most probably depend on my mining for a steady income. IF things go the way I hope they do. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:26:36
According to McAfee in 2020 we should hit 1000 000. That is the year my wife and I intend to retire.  BTC is a small part of our retirement funds but it will be a very nice of amount of fuckyou money.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:46:44
Yes and no. Depends what you want to do. Now my strategy is that I bought some BTC a while ago. Invested most of it in a mining pool. Its going great guns and ROI (in BTC) will be I expect August /September 2018. The way the mining is going I expect after that to continue accumulating BTC but I can then sell BTC on an exchange for FIAT as I need it. Whatever I sell I will then declare to the taxman as an income. Many people do it that way. No need to reinvent the wheel. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:23:37
I think the issue here is what if it is not a bubble? What if the real price is north of 100k? That is scary..(as in going up a roller coaster scary) What if bitcoin sucks Wallstreet dry? 
We should not be worried about it, its the banks and central banks that should be worried.

Gimme 2 years and I am outta here. Not out of BTC but work. I work for myself but both my wife and I love to travel. Not fancy, in our old Landcruiser , just pack up and go, whatever way the wind it blowing us that day. Thats the freedom that Bitcoin will give me. I hodl and mine, will probably  save a few coins and then just live of the mining proceeds.
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:02:23
End of 2020 here. I do hope the McAffee dick at that stage is firmly attached to his body and intact. I do not need BTC to retire but it will make life so much easier.

I dont trust my government further than I can spit
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:10:54
Depends. I mine as a hobby at home, just for kicks, My PC is on all the time so its just a little widget running in the background eating the CPU time. I clear about 50c a week. I also have 11k invested in Antminers that is making a decent income. I have more fun with the CPU mining.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:27:04
Just pulling your leg. Life is to short to take seriously. I find that some people, younger than me are just soooo fucking old. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:05:52
Maybe as a hobby but to make serious coin you are wasting your time. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:28:56
I would like to know how they going to enforce it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:54:19
Retiring in 2 years time. Just spread your risk. I am pretty sure that that type of exchange will come about, but none of us know when (hey...why not try that as a startup yourself) Main thing spread your risk.

Bitcoin or any crypto have taken off much more in Africa than people think. Our politicians are so crooked and downright scoundrels that they make Ver look like a upstanding trustworthy member of society. Crypto protects us normal people from the consequences of bad government.   
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:24:47
When Fiat tanks people will always rush to a safe haven, gold for instance. Now they will have another option, BTC. Its much more convenient than gold so i think that is where BTC will score big time.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:19:46
Full retirement, 2 years to go, but my mining side of it can just keep on trucking.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:07:24
I am in up to my eyeballs,  heavily invested in mining and yes deep down I just hodl and see things grow. Its basically my "fuckyou" money that  I invested in BTC
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:24:29
You cannot predict the future. It can crash tomorrow or next month. I am loath to call it a crash. Its just a price correction as BTC has always come back higher. We have a saying in Africa..if the bowl is full of porridge you must take what you can. That is what you should do and enjoy the ride. Besides remember last weekend when the price stayed stable? How boring was that? Dude...ups and downs that what life is about.

Zim does not have enough US currency. For 13K you get a government note that is supposedly backed by US$.Everybody knows its not. So you get your 13K in Zim shitnotes and now have to find street traders that will convert shitnotes to US$. At a rate that will make your eyes water. They have a ongoing coup at the moment so its an entire shitstorm there. Try in 3-6 months when things have settled down a bit. Source...Zim is just a hop over the river from me 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:29:36
Dude, you must work with very old 45-50year olds. Wont see 54 again and bunch of my friends and myself been into BTC for a while, mining and trading.  Now GTF off my lawn
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:16
I thinks its just because more and more people are becoming aware of it. Think of it as the Facebook of money. It gets its value from people and the more people use it..well the more value it has. Now there will be dips, lots of them. Just look at the Amazon share price graph.Same thing. Moral of the story..Ignore the hubris and accumulate.

Fee fo fum I smell a scam
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:09:09
Its just a sideline that i do. The cash...well is small potatoes in the real scheme of things. I am just a hodler by heart and why not make a few BTC (i hope) on the side. Thanks for the comments. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:00:07
Yep it is. Mainly because its not my main income and I am a hodler at heart. I just trust the maths. I dont make as much as I did in December but I still make and that is the important thing. In this for the long term. I just think that most of the people that have their knickers in a knot are those that  1: Put all their money into it. (I dont  even do that with stocks and bonds) and 2: expect to drive a Lambo  by June. Its not going to happen and there is no such thing as easy money.  
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:48:26
Anywhere in Africa where you have a kleptocracy  as government cryptos are the go to currency. right about now the buggers are planning to steal everyone land with no compensation. So I waltzd over to the bank got a nice fat bond on the house and will invest that in crypto. Day that shits happens fuck you I am outta here and my money has left the country as crypto long before I left. The ones holding the can will be the banksters  and I really, really feel sorry for them. NOT
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:17:38
I just think we should not think about how much FIAT we earn in a day. Its the amount of BTC that counts. As long as that stays within my target range..I am cool with whatever the dollar price is. Having said that..I mine with equipment and money that I can afford to loose so it will probably be different for people that need to sell BTC to make a living out of mining.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:53:45
Happy days. Fees nearly killed me in December. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:56:49
Same here. Happy days.
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:49:52
I think thus slow increase is beter than the mad rush of December. Less excitement but more sustainable in the long run. You know, dicks being safe and all that, even at this slower rate
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:58:48
Doing some cloud mining here. It works, but you have to do your homework. Since November I have mined 0.5 a coin, My investment was 2 BTC. (bought way back) 
Would I do it again? Yes and no. I would still do it but probably make a smaller investment. 
There are quite a few scams about so please, do your research, and don't invest everything in mining. That said, I have a little GPU mining rig at home that I run with Nicehash. Probably the most fun I have had with investments for years. Its peanuts compared to the other stuff but its fun.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:28:09
Time based. I will see what it is when I retire. (2 years ) May sell of a bit then and travel. A lot. I don't really need the cash
