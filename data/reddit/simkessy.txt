Is it really fast because no one is using it yet and will it keep up with the current transactions? I'm sure bitcoin was fast in it's infancy as well right. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:28:09
Well that's a horrible way of selling it. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:15:39
Oh yea I hated having to use one but it was the simplest solution for him.

I love these stories. My younger brother was stuck in Washington after getting his wallet stolen. I told him to pull up his phone and walked him through how to install a wallet. Send him over a few coins. Found an ATM near him and he was able to pull out cash. It was really cool. I'm slightly annoyed I had to sell those coins but whatever, it was neat. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:16:04
Isnt this what happened to Etherum, this is dumb.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:26:43
Regarding the privacy issue, could you claim your BCH, then move your BTC to another wallet with different keys private keys. So now youd have BCH and BTC (but not at risk).
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:58:03
I wanted to do the same, where do you keep it and how do you ensure only he has access when he turns X age? Or do you just hope you're still around by the time they are hold enough? Was a lawyer involved? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:17:02
Oh cool, thanks
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:10:14
Is a bitcoin ATM worth the investment? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:42:57
I feel like this would be a good idea if the phone isn't used. Like an old phone you turn on just to move coins. Maybe install a clean version of Android on it. Why is this no good?
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:12:08
My younger brother was in Washington and needed emergency money. He happened to be staying somewhere close to an ATM and I was able to walk him through getting JAX, sending him the coins and using the ATM to pull out cash. So yea, they're pretty useful and I didn't have to deal with Western Union which would have taken a fee anyways. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:41:10
Yea he got his wallet stolen, hence, emergency.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:19:08
I'm curious, how do you sign a message with private keys? Is there a tool you use or something? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:16:02
Is Shapeahift really that bad, let's say I just want to build a portfolio of a few coins and hold for a long time. Which would you recommend.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:46:20


Isn't the point of crypto currencies the exact opposite of that statement? The fact  that we don't or don't want to trust a centralized authority to determine or influence the store of value?
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:22:52
Isn't this what happened with ETH / ETC and now we have two coins which both has a sizable market cap?
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:19:57
This is what I wasn't sure about at first. Are certain wallets just for certain coins? Like Trezor and Ledger I wouldn't be able to hold Ether or Fatcom, Dash or anything else? Am I getting that right? 
And with Exodus, how safe is it, do I just install it locally and I'm good? At first I was thinking, if I'm getting a wallet, I should install it on a more secure system like a Linux VM or something but I'm not sure if I'm over doing it or not. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:41:04










@_date: 2017-05-22 20:56:28
Yup. I knew about it like 6 years ago but never really bothered to look into it. Kicking myself now. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:47:21
[Here we go](
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:57:14
0 historical evidence of that but okay. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:13:06


He has 700,000 bitcoins?!
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:52:54
I'm in Canada, we have QuadrigaCX to buy coins in CAD. So when I buy from there, I need to transfer them to my Exodus Wallet? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:22:26
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:06:48
If I have coins in my wallet, let's say Exodus, and I want to quickly cash out, what's the fastest option? Is it simply sending the money back to one of the exchanges and converting it back to USD? Is this a long process or what should I keep in mind? 
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:02:05
I understand why the government would want to do it, but I don't see the incentive for the people to accept whatever the state comes up with as the defacto currency. Like stated earlier, could they not just decide to use whatever existing coin is available, why move to the government sanctioned coin.   
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:08:14
Whats a better alternative?
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:16:29
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:42:27


You say that and yet ETC is worth $1.6 billion right now. Unless there's consensus, which there really doesn't seem to be thus far, it's hard for me to understand how you can make that statement with such confidence when ETH/ETC is a clear example of 2 chains running when people couldn't agree.
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:35:51
Where's a good place to buy with the lower fees?
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:08:45
I've been seeing these terms all week without understanding what they meant. This really helps. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:07:32
Who is this guy, why's he talked about so much? 
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:05:12
I noticed the when I install Exodus it provides me 1 wallet addresses for each type of coin (2 for Bitcoin?).  So If I install this application on a different machine, will it generate new addresses again?
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:09:47
I'm not talking about the GBTC
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:55:02
Well, he is, just like Trump is. Can't have it both ways. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:42:44
Yea I don't get it, bunch of people saying they pay really cheap fees and I just paid 20$ to send 1/3 of a coin. 
How do you lower your fees? 
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:19:14
Yeaaa, I was just kind of playing around with it trying to figure out this whole fee thing. 
Anyway to fix it? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:11:53
Hey! I ended up doing that earlier and it did work. I noticed they both go approved and wasn't sure if it was a coincidence or if it was related. Thanks for confirming.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:49:01
Coinomi has the same features. I was testing that out today and I sent a transaction that was too low apparently. I'm not sure what to do now?
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:26:27
Alright, sounds like wait it out is the go to answer. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:40:57
Holy fuck.
@_date: 2017-06-26 05:37:33
It was stuck for a while but sending another transaction from the same wallet with higher fees got it through.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:38:26
I am little confused about fees and blocks. Is a node confirming a block of transactions of individual transactions? 
If it's a block, why does it matter what an individual transaction fee is set at? 
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:32:46
I had a transaction that was 2kb and was just sending a few btc. How do you control the size of your transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:21:19
I just paid $20 to move from my exchange to my android wallet. Seems like a lot. Am I going to have to pay another $20 to move that same amount to my desktop? 
Plus it took like an hour. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:31:54
Oh okay, so the miners can be selective in the transactions they choose to include in their blocks and the fee incentives them to include your transaction. Got it. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:50:37
I bought maybe 30 minute before it crashed hahah 
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:36:57
How come I just paid $20 bucks (2kb) for sending less than half a coin to my android wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:43:31
Go on?
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:32:22
Is my transaction fee too low? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:41:18
If it's your primary gmail account it would be annoying. Should setup a second email account just for this stuff. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:50:59
I don't know about that. I set my transaction fee too low and I'm not even sure if it will ever get confirmed. It's been like 6 hours.
