I spent hours on this puzzle but I learned my lesson. I think puzzles like this with such a high valued prize need to have some sort of outside adjudicator before anyone wastes their time.
The fact that the solution hasn't been posted and the 1 BTC has disappeared just confirms it was a scam. 
Thankfully I stopped trying to solve it when cryptogreetings stopped posting to the Reddit thread. I'd say this was nothing but a traffic generating tactic for the owner's card shop. Asshole!

I pretty sure I've solved this but I've no idea how to claim the BTC. Please advice. I have a valid sequence of words but I don't know how to recover it.

Any new clues? 
99&amp; of all clues I'm managed to crack and make total sense. Just trying to narrow down now. I'm sure any more clues and I will crack this. BTW, this is a VERY CLEVER bit of art. You can tell a lot of work has gone into it. On the surface you can assume it's just random but it really isn't. Genius. Even if this is a marketing puzzle as someone suggested earlier, you deserve the exposure.
Would you tell me how close I am in a private message?

I'm almost there but think its been claimed already

perfect thanks.
What I've done is every valid seed list I hit, I run this through Electrum wallet under BIP49. I think this is the right way. I now have about 100 empty wallets though. haha

I think I have a very good idea of the solution but I'm new to bitcoin and I don't know to check my seed words. I was advised to use [ and select BIP49 but its really complicated and I dont know if I'm doing it right. Every so often, I get a huge list of private &amp; public keys that dont match the solution. Its taking me ages to check every single line. If I'm lucky enough to hit the correct seed, will only one address be shown?
Also, are there any easier ways of doing this?

That's not even right, quite a few words are missing.

has somebody won this already. I think the wallet is empty!

Haha This is what I have been saying to people. Every time I go work I feel anxious because this puzzle has taken over my life. I dare not add up all the hours I've invested so far but put it this way, I've skipped meals and showers already. Haha
The good thing about spending this much time trying to crack the puzzle is I no longer have to look at the image. lol

I literally skipped meals &amp; showers for the first few days. haha

I had a nightmare where the OP posted a comment saying, "sorry, I posted the wrong image!"

Lol. They not lying, just being economical with the truth. Bitcoin cash ppl make me laugh. Like everything and anything in crypto DYOR.
