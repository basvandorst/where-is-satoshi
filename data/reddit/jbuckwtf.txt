No not claiming, js if hacking is the foundation then so far so good for Kucoin. I don't particularly care when something started, we all start somewhere, but they never took my funds, shorted me, cheated me, spammed me, and my account hasn't been hacked. What else do you need an engraved certification lol

I've used Kucoin since Nov 2017. When have they been hacked?
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:54:41
That or someone's getting scammed lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:44:00
Lol yeah they're still there. I'm not an idiot, the only thing I hold there is KCS for the divs. I frequently visit for trading, same with CBP. But my question was when were they hacked? Care to answer or...

How much did you lose?
@_date: 2019-08-17 11:15:47
Depends on the length of the loan I suppose. I might do it if the loan is for 1 year...but would pass if only for a month or few weeks.

Actually banks create money with ANY deposit. That means you go to the bank, deposit $100, they take that $100 and give you a deposit slip, aka IOU. That $100 is immediately gone, and all you have is an IOU for it. The bank then takes that $100 and invests it, spends it, etc. and created new money out of thin air when they created your IOU. If you think that's bananas, wait until you learn about the Fed and Treasury Dept!!!

The best way I heard it put was from Fast Money, and I agree. I don't know the quote verbatim, but paraphrasing basically said we're now in the "AOL" moment. AOL got people online, it's not what we use now but it was the doorway for most people. Libra is like that in that it will be easy to use, and will get people familiar with digital wallets etc. With Coinbase being involved I imagine a lot of Libra will be exchanged for Bitcoin in the not too distant future.

Sooner the better imho. You can try to time the market and wait for a downturn, but nobody around here is really expecting one soon that isn't shilling another coin.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:14:26
Not entirely true. Per CBP "When you place an order at the market price that gets filled immediately, you are considered a taker and will pay a fee between 0.05% and 0.25%. When you place an order which is not immediately matched by an existing order, that order is placed on the order book. If another customer places and order that matches yours, you are considered the maker and will pay a fee between 0% and 0.15%." You could pay fees either way.

The irony is a lot of us know it, but ultimately won't care (imo) until the government aggressively tries to outright sieze our guns or other "freedoms." I believe there's still a lot of heart and fight in us but we've grown fat and lazy. I kind of like to think of the American people as a sleeping bear...go up to it and really poke it and see what happens. People are too preoccupied with themselves and social media and one-upping everyone it's damn near impossible to coordinate a birthday party let alone a revolution against the most well funded government in the world :(

I'm not sure how people feel about imToken but I like it a lot. I only send what I need to use to it, and don't keep any significant amount as you have to import private keys to it to import wallets, but has worked very well for me.
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:49:21
All you do is use the credentials you use on Coinbase, no further registration required. Just go to pro.coinbase.com and login like you're logging into Coinbase. After you're in go to deposit, select your coin, and choose transfer from Coinbase. Easy peasy.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:08:11
No problem at all, and I understand you quite well no worries at all. Well we just saw another sell off at $11k forcing BTC to fall below $10.35, but it's rebounded above $10.7...that's another pretty good signal to me tbh. But there will be another fall, correction, etc. but I think you're right how far. We got up to $19k and fell to about $3.6k before stabilizing...this time I doubt we fall to $6k before it's all over but I have no idea when. Maybe you could buy 10% now, hodl and watch, research, and if the price falls buy more and dollar cost average. If it rises yay! Take profits at the next dip :)
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:33:48
I honestly don't know if it matters or not anymore. I mean, say government's everywhere enact laws and make Bitcoin illegal. What happens? Anyone who did KYC or AML etc will be hunted down one by one? Locked up? Forced to hand over private keys? What if they sent their funds to offline wallets? To other people? I don't believe the US government can or will forcibly try to take anything from the people tbh. Hence all the sneaky deals, corruption, etc. I'm on record anyways...I didn't fulllllllly research before I created a CB account and dove in. Now I do it everywhere because why not? I ask not to be sarcastic, but really what's the worst that can happen to me since I filled out KYC and have multiple wallets? Government locks me up? Kills me? My Bitcoin lives on in the person I entrust before it got that far so idk. If it gets that bad I may not wanna be here anyways js.
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:14:29
You can use blockchains for more than just cryptos js
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:49:41
Np at all :)
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:42:43
Go to wallets, deposit, add USDC, and under method choose bank account or wire transfer. You have to have a linked checking acct.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:00:40
You would need a bot to trigger a limit sell at that low of a point. You can't set a sell limit below market, or the last sold/bought price, but you can set a buy limit below market, and a sell limit above market. At least as far as Coinbase Pro, it wont even let me set a limit for a penny below market.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:50:45
Kudos for hanging in there. Hope you got more at the bottom too haha
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:35:06
If manipulation drove the markets 2 yrs ago why aren't they continually being manipulated? We should see it monthly, weekly, daily even. Tbh I would just call it supply and demand. When people buy a lot of something, the price tends to rise as supply shortens and people are willing to spend more. On the other hand, when people sell a lot of something the price tends to fall as people are willing to take less. Perhaps a few whales purchased a lot of BTC and the price responded accordingly. Whenever the whales sold, those who didn't know any better who bought out of FOMO most likely got caught holding the bag. Don't worry tho BTC (imo) will see $19k again.

If by all your coin you mean what you have in Coinbase then yes, for free and instantly too...but they don't list every coin if that's what you're wondering. Any coin on Coinbase transfers fast and free tho...to and from.

If you use Coinbase just load USD into it from your card or checking account and transfer to Coinbase Pro for free. CB and CBP have same login credentials and the fees are much cheaper. Transfers between CB and CBP are free and instant.

Few reasons not limited to any particular event imho. The upcoming halving. Wider institutional adoption and/or mainstream awareness. Facebook's Libra announcement. The "factor of 10."
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:55:17
Buy USDC from Coinbase, hop over to Coinbase Pro (free) and import your USDC from your Coinbase wallet (free) and trade for what you were going to buy. You're welcome!

The more I think about it there ARE stop orders. You can set your limit anywhere above market and set your stop anywhere you want below market. In this case at 7500 market one could place a stop with an 8000 limit and 7250 stop and it will create an open order. Hell w the current market @ 7967 it'll create the order now lol.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:08:49
That's the thing, nobody truly knows for sure. Keep researching, reading, learning, and you'll eventually develop a sort of "feel" for swings. BTC hit the ATH in Dec 2017 and a lot of bag holders (the ones who bought at "the top") will be looking to exit (thinking pessimistic of course) imo anywhere between now and $19k, maybe $20k so as to take profits. To me a recent indicator was $10k; I figured a lot would sell. They did sell, but the orders were eaten and now we're over $11.1k. Haven't totally delved into volumes but to me I'm absolutely bullish to $15k so imho it's still good to buy. I buy and hodl faithfully tho.
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:30:39
Coinbase is more a broker where Pro is an exchange...used to be Mt Gox.
The advantage w Pro is you can exchange your USD for much smaller fees and get better prices with limits...Coinbase charges a fee as well as above market prices. You get off cheaper w Pro.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:43:02
Agreed. Seems like greed (or worse) got the best of this guy.
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:41:49
True if you have a linked checking account, but not true for those who have just debit cards linked.
@_date: 2019-09-09 19:40:47
You can buy and sell BTC through cash app now. To enable withdrawals and deposits you have to submit KYC.

Global wealth as we know it is based on today's dollar value though, as is BTC. If the dollar were ever irrelevant, BTC could be worth anything...a satoshi could be worth the equivalent of $1, $10, $100. Sounds like, according to the man's claim, people ditch fiat altogether in favor of Bitcoin. If enough people did that, then that global wealth of $400T might only be worth 1 BTC some day. But to all happen by 2025??? Lmao. The original post this came from is a great time burner though.

I've been using Abra for some time now, and honestly I like it. They don't have a lot of coins to invest in but they have the one that matters.
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:47:50
And there will be hell to pay for it. I'm not downing, hating, or doubting its necessity I'm just merely hoping all the kool kids make it. I'd hate to have to spend my BTC alone after so many years of begging people to get in now...but I'll do it.
