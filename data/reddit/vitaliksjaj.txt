Kraken isn't having issues with "many new customers" as they claim.  This is just pure bs they are spouting off.  All you have to look at is their volume of trades per day which is piss poor compared to any exchange.  GDAX handles &gt;10x their volume with no problems whatsoever.  
Also, look at their wallet on etherscan....all I see is thousands of outgoing transactions, customers leaving due to trades not executing.  I even used their API and nothing goes through.  I would have to spam 25 orders at once just to get 2 to go through.
Jesse Powell is the next Mark Karpeles, and the piece of shit owes me a quarter million dollars.  If you can't execute trades, don't allow trading.  I'm convinced the entire order book is his buddy Roger Ver, just ramming the prices up and down liquidating customers.  Margin trading isn't worth it and the risk is 10x magnified when the trading engine doesn't work.  What could possibly be worse? Oh yea let's remove stop losses. Straight up negligence and fraud.

Is this just a retarded bot that keeps reposting this same canned message? lol

Then they removed the ability to have stops at all.  I don't know how they think this won't come back to them.

I agree with this post more and more every day. Lost 300K to the Krak-den.  Complete horseshit how they say they have had a "large influx of customers".  More like mass exodus.

Kraken is definitely in collusion with someone. They have one market maker on their exchange just liquidating people. They are likely insolvent from the flash crash and are now practicing front running and basically a bucket shop desperately trying to get back to solvency.
