All true.


That's a non sequitur. Just because people can buy bitcoins as an investment, and because doing so is more risky than most people will accept, doesn't mean bitcoin is a "non-starter". You can have bitcoins as investments for people and organizations willing to accept the risk, bitcoins used for transactions instead of for investment, and even insurance-backed bitcoin investments. You're arguing that because startups are risky and usually fail, that nobody will ever start a new business.

If there is a trend of links to other reddit threads in this subreddit, and if users tend to downvote comments that are critical of bitcoin, and if users regularly make (what could be judged) harassing replies/comments, then the reddit admins may ban like they did with Admittedly, it takes a lot for the admins to do that (in it climaxed when one user published the home address of and made death threats towards another user), but there's no reason for us to start down a path that would allow one idiot subscriber of to get the entire subreddit banned. Admins forbid large-scale "brigading", which they define as voting in a subreddit after following a link in another subreddit. Let's not do that.

Upvote Gates, sure, that's something not generally frowned upon by reddit admins. But I'm sure that some users will reply to Gates with comments critical of Bitcoins, and those are the ones I think we should resist the urge to downvote or leave snarky replies to. Quality, educational replies are probably fine.
It's tough because the official reddit stance of what is and isn't allowed is not clear. Therefore, we should avoid doing things that people would complain about: voting one type of comment heavily negative or leaving low-quality replies.

The reason "passwords in plaintext" is generally bad is because of the risk of someone malicious capturing your password. However, context is important. The box where you type your password on a web page is literally the exact same as the box where you type your username except that it doesn't display the characters you type. Password hashing is almost never done client side, and is instead sent in "plaintext" over an encrypted channel to the server. The server receives your plaintext password, runs the hash, and drops the plaintext password from memory. The issue with POST versus GET is that if the password is in plaintext in the URL, then a malicious person could access your browsing history ~~or sniff your packets and see your password. SSL doesn't encrypt URLs~~.
Edit: Oops. I knew that. No idea why I remembered it wrong here.

There's nothing bad about Google Authenticator IMO, but there are plenty of alternative [TOTP]( smartphone apps if you don't trust it. KeePass is a great option and I recommend that everyone uses it, but it's not convenient for many people. And it's more risky to have your second authentication reside on the same system as your primary one.

1. Everyone agrees Mt Gox is partially at fault. I only see 1 reply in this thread defending the site, and everyone else if critical of them. And the entire bitcoin community has been pretty critical of them for years.
2. Yup. Good. Have you seen what the average person does for computer security? It's ridiculous. [62% of MD5 hashed passwords were cracked in 16 minutes, in one example.]( Anyone who works in IT knows the breadth of computer security ignorance, not just passwords but everything. Yeah, bitcoin users may be above average in terms of tech savvy, but it's not going to be that much better. And OP wasn't even average: he had 15% of his yearly income on MtGox. Juicy targets like him had damn well better devote some time and energy into improving their digital security. It's a lesson more people should learn (globally, not just related to bitcoin). Hopefully other people will learn from people like OP without having to lose their money or identities.
3. Just because the majority of users do something doesn't mean that something is correct. What people are giving him shit? All the popular posts are telling him that he should have enabled two factor authentication or are criticizing MtGox. Reddit isn't a safe space, so you'll always have a few people being rude, but that's a characteristic of humanity and/or reddit, not about the bitcoin community. And nobody gives someone else shit intending it to fix the problem. There are users in this thread helping OP fix the problem, but you seem to want to ignore all of those. No, people are "giving OP shit" (and I use quotes because holy fuck, if you think *this* is someone being given a hard time then you must break down in tears a dozen times a day from people looking at you funny) to reinforce the fact that stupid computer security decisions and omissions have consequences when it comes to bitcoins. Like I said before, if investors are alienated by a community that values personal responsibility and knowledge then fuck them. The really big investors are used to dealing with investments where they can lose big if they do something dumb. People making $40k/year and who aren't willing to spend some time learning about computer security shouldn't have much money in bitcoin, and probably shouldn't be in MtGox at all.

~~No, you'd use the algorithm weakness to crack the private key of his wallet, whose public key you already know. With the private key, you could create a legitimate transaction out of his wallet into yours.~~
Yeah, you'd have to crack each transaction (but you wouldn't have to do anything to change who owns the bitcoins; just get the private key so that you can pose as the person who owns the coins). But theoretically, if the encryption is broken, that might be possible anyways.

I don't find it a particularly funny joke, but I don't think that whining about the social implications of jokes is productive. Some people apparently *do* find it funny, and for them to go from laughing to being accused of perpetuating gender roles and oppressing women alienates them from the social justice movement. There are better ways and places to introduce people to the concepts of women's rights. Complaining about jokes makes you look petulant.

When you're at a party with friends and one of them mentions that his fiancee wants to hold the wedding in her hometown church, it is inappropriate to start a tirade about the Catholic church's opposition to condoms. If you're with those same friends and talking about world problems, you might be able to wedge it in there. Likewise, there are some situations, like people posting jokes, in which it is unacceptable to go on a tirade about gender stereotypes. Other times, like news articles about gender or maybe even an article about a woman in which the author treats her gender like it's something special (first woman to make $1 million in bitcoins, maybe?), it would be appropriate.

You seem to have changed the topic. Above, you complained that we were being meany heads. Now you're joining the majority opinion that MtGox could do more for security. Your second post doesn't support your statements from the first. I'm not arguing that MtGox shouldn't improve security, I'm arguing that 1) people are responsible for ensuring the safety and security of their own bitcoins because that's the nature of bitcoins, and 2) if people are stupid in regards to the safety and security of their own bitcoins, it's fine to tell them so.
You're almost referencing Rumsfeld's "unknown unknowns", so how about this twist on another Rumsfeld quote: "you use MtGox with the security settings they have, not the security settings you might want or wish to have at a later time." The fact that Mt Gox didn't do something is unrelated to the fact that is responsible for his own fuckup.
I'm of the opinion that being responsible with security issues includes "opening up and doing a cursory read-through of the security settings page" of your high-vulnerability accounts like email and banking. That would have solved your unknown unknowns dilemma here. You said "one small hole is all it takes", which is also wrong. Many small holes need to align for you to be vulnerable. Holes like reusing passwords, having truthful answers to password reset questions, downloading shady software, and not using two factor authentication when it's available. Responsible computer security involves many layers, so that when a mistake is made or a zero-day is revealed that bypasses one layer you're not fucked. Not using two factor authentication by itself doesn't give a malicious person access to your account.

I wish MtGox wasn't synonymous with bitcoin. 3-4 big exchanges would make for a healthier bitcoin economy. I think the lack of competition causes a lot of these problems: having different groups coming up with "good ideas" like transaction delays to differentiate themselves, which would then be copied and improved by the other markets. And when people like make these posts we could say "Damn, that sucks, dude. MtGox is not a website you should use if you're not going to take charge of your own digital security. Head over to OtherBitCoinStockExchange. Their transaction fees are a little higher but they're bundled with an escrow service..." As it stands, we're saying "Damn, that sucks, dude. You should have enabled two factor authentication." and he and you are getting pissy about the replies. entire post here, particularly his second edit, is childish and insulting. He recommends everyone else should move their money out of MtGox because he did something stupid and he thinks everyone else will be equally as stupid.
Bitcoin is not mature enough to be a safe investment for casual users. It *is* secure enough for smaller transactions by casual users, and that's the direction bitcoin needs to grow. Honestly, I don't think Bitcoin will ever be safe for average users to use as an investment. If you're going to keep a big digital nest egg, you need to put it in a strong digital safe, which will be a very juicy target for hackers, which means (short of air-gapping) it'll probably require above-average knowledge of computer security to implement.

If I bystander's primary thought about two factor authentication is "a feature that isn't well advertised" and "isn't trivial" (assuming you mean two factor authentication is complicated/difficult), then that bystander shouldn't be putting $4000 in bitcoins. Being knowledgeable about bitcoin means having some computer acumen. We're not talking much, either. It's really fucking easy, and if you have trouble there are dozens of picture guides to walk you through it.
You're also forgetting that if you had $4000 in cash and someone robbed you, you're not getting your money back either. And if someone did something stupid that led to them getting robbed, people are rightly going to tell them they were being stupid.
The whole value of bitcoins is that the platform offers secure, anonymous, non-reversible transactions unbacked by banks and governments. People are used to services that banks offer like investigating and reimbursing for fraudulent transactions, but bitcoin doesn't offer that natively. It can't (debatable, but I think "can't" is the general consensus). There's an unfulfilled market for a bitcoin bank that does offer that insurance. Mt Gox certainly isn't offering that. People who believe that it is offering that are at risk for a rude awakening. If that turns them off of bitcoin then fuck them. Why should our community change to be more appealing to the willfully, obstinately ignorant? (I'm not talking about he made a mistake, paid for it, and has learned his lesson. I'm talking about these mystical bystanders of yours who would read this story and decide that bitcoin is too risky and our community too rude to be worth the minutes it would take to educate themselves.)
There is a valid point that Mt Gox could do a better job at security, but that's actively discussed here and elsewhere in @_date: 2013-08-12 16:12:59
Why not enable it?
Edit, clarification: If there were never any bugs or vulnerabilities in Mt Gox, then login authentication would be enough to stop someone who [has your password, brute forced your password, has access to your email account, knows answers to your secret questions, etc.] from stealing all your money. I, personally, am not comfortable relying on that assumption, and I don't think anyone dealing with moderate to large amounts of money and bitcoins should either.
