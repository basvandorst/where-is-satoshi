Thanks for the great comments and suggestions.  Sorry it took me so long to find this Reddit stream.  I can't address all the comments here, but mostly they seem on track and very insightful.  I received a huge number of great suggestions and I've been forwarding them to our chief architect.
The best way to understand our thinking is to read the white paper we posted (previously linked to by another commenter -  ).  The title of our paper "Device Democracy" was intended to send a strong message about our desire to see, in the long run, a re-decentralization of the internet and one that is made to serve the needs of users in a manner that is sustainable in cost and respectful of our privacy.
We are leveraging three technologies here - Ethereum, Telehash, and BitTorrent - all of which can help us make every "thing" a point of transaction processing in a distributed network with secure transport and the ability to move big files as well as small ones.
In January, we plan to show a proof of concept built in cooperation with Samsung.  Our "Adept" platform blends these together and is already running in the lab on things like Arduino but we want to show in a real world setting on real devices executing a realistic work scenario.  At that time we will release a technical white paper and open source the work we have done so far.
I'm always interested to receive your suggestions and thoughts.  I'm  on Twitter.
