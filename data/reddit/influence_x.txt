His words being targeted harassment, he's being sued by the parents of the Sandy Hook mass shooting because he all but called for action against the parents for being "crisis actors". Their lives have been a miserable assault of people doxing them, death threats, etc... 
 Free speech has limits, threats, inciting violence or targeted harassment are illegal for good reason. 
Dont get me wrong, Paypal fucking sucks, I do NOT use them or trust them for various reasons. I just dont understand why people are defending this abhorrent fucker when his speech frequently straddles the boundaries of what is legal with harassment, slander/libel. 




True enough.

No, the wealth divide right now between the top 1% and the bottom 99 is greater than it ever has been, since the medieval guided age.

Uh... You're mixing public and private censorship. There is no law that protects the baptists right to use paypal. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 20:37:57


Ok, good luck finding a place on earth you can do that.Just know that's completely unrelated to the US concept of free speech as defined by law and the US constitution.


Uh.. Ok, im done here.
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:11:15
You're literally advocating for no restrictions on "speech" or "use" in private spaces.   
E.g. Recognize the same kids from the spring break party that trashed your hotel? Cant refuse them, that's censorship.
As posted on many businesses windows "We reserve the right to refuse to service to anyone".
That's a legal right, and legally protected action guaranteed by law for private business.
@_date: 2018-09-01 15:28:36
Yeah but guns are cheap and healthcare/education are prohibitively expensive. There must be some way to keep education and healthcare cheaper, while still abiding by the libertarian principle of voluntary participation.   
Honestly though, I think you really cant apply free market principles to healthcare. Supply and demand breaks down with participation in a system such as healthcare is involuntary. It makes price gouging and exploitation too easy, since there's a significantly lower incentive for competition.

Whatever you say, boss. Because I'm realistic with politics/policy/reality doesn't mean that I don't dream of having every billionaire relinquish his wealth or have it seized and redistributed. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:46:37
Regardless if you believe it's morally correct or not, public and private censorship are completely different in US law.
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:46:48


Completely false. You cannot scream fire in a crowded movie theater, you cannot scream bomb on an airplane. You cannot say "I'm going to murder the president of the US" in public. 
"Freedom of speech" does not mean "freedom from consequence of speech"
Nowhere on earth is this considered "free speech". 


No more or less "violence" than encouraging vigilante action taken on the parents of children involved in a mass shooting.

I'm not full communist. And in practice I'm mostly against policies that benefit the CEO and billionaire class. I see bitcoin as a way for the common man to invest in a currency that is resistant to inflation. 
I truly believe that bitcoin will maintain its value in the next 10-20 years.

Then how is refusing someone to use paypal speech?


I dont see how this is relevant to paypal saying someone cant use their services.

No, they're not. You may as well have state controlled agencies and businesses if you're not going to give them the freedom to refuse service. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:02:35
Yeah, that's true. But I believe there's also something to be said about detaching a currency from a state controlled economy, as a means to keep inflation value in the hands of the worker.

I mean, yes. But that's overly simplistic as well.
Especially when it comes to rural Americans getting fucked over by Republican policy and continuing to vote for them.
Are democrats better? Not really, but they're also not actively looking to cut whatever social benefits actually help the working poor. Rural Americans truely believe Trump was going to fight for them.   
Now farmers are facing economic crisis across the country, so much that the government is going to buy their crops... essentially being a form of socialism the party they voted for claims to be against.

Yeah, nothing says strong since of entitlement like having healthcare and education like any other 1st world nation.
Or maybe not wanting such a SHIT healthcare system that it has the highest maternal death rate of any industrialized nation? 
Totally. Entitlements.  
Only in America is a firearm considered a right, and education and healthcare are considered entitlements.

Depends, can 100% of what they make get them what they need to survive?   
Does a man work harder with 100% of a minimum wage, and no healthcare/housing assistance/food assistance?   
Does a man work harder with 50% of that same minimum wage job but with guaranteed housing, healthcare, and food?

@_date: 2018-08-31 21:07:55
I absolutely agree with your statement. And maybe for a "full communist" approach that's how it would work.
For me personally, I just see it as freedom from inflation, which can totally benefit the working class.

1. [Black and white fallacy]( see: Nordic nations with semi socialist support structures while having capitalist economic systems, and some of the best measures of life for average citizens on earth. 
2. Because Trumps rhetoric is almost universally considered racist. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 19:56:06
Wow that's literally the opinion article my "libertarian" uncle used. 
Ok, here's a quote from the source your article highlights in one of the first sentences. 
"While it is true that the Scandinavian countries provide things like a generous social safety net and universal health care, an extensive welfare state is not the same thing as socialism."
Nobody is arguing to have state control over the economy, just that the healthcare and education systems break down because "supply and demand" is not equitable in cases where you have no choice as to participate in the system... like with healthcare. 
It's almost like any improvement that should be applied to everyone, such as paid maternity leave that's in virtually every other country around the US, just increases arguments of socialism. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:45:58
So you're telling me the country with the military budget greater than the next 10 nations combined is going to fail from too many social benefits?
The ones I'm advocating for are strictly for the working poor. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:21:39

I don't think Hayek anticipated the wealth divide getting as great as it has. IMO the tax haven offshore billionaires and lack of a reliable social safety nets are whats fucking the common man right now.

I would say the democratic socialist movement within the current democratic party does care very much, seeing as how they're fighting for a higher minimum wage while minorities make up a disproportionate amount of the working poor in the US.
Standard, Clinton esque democrats, probably not as much.


If you really believe racial issues in the US have "grown old" you're clearly not paying attention to the US police/prison system killing and incarcerating a grossly disproportionate amount of minorities in America.

@_date: 2018-08-31 21:05:04
Well... yeah. It's hypothesized that the original "wealth divide" started with the invention and mass adoption of agriculture. As soon as someone was able to horde resources, is when austerity started to appear.
Neolithic farmers were often shorter and their bones less dense when compared to their hunter-gatherer counterparts, they had shorter lives, worse health, and were subject to their plot of land and anything that could go wrong with it.
