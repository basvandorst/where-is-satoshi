Buy when high, sell when low. All the cool kids are doing it.

Paper wallet. But tell them they should look into more secure options.

People stare blindly at the price per BTC. $10.000+ is a lot of money in most people’s eyes, so they think it can’t possibly go much higher. Until you look into its market capitalization versus the value of all the money in the world.

Most of your money? Don’t go too crazy, there’s no guarantee that we’re going to BTC moon.

When I read his book 1.5 years ago, it felt like my eyes had finally opened. I was raised the poor dad’s way, and I have begun to question everything - jobs, money, lending,...

But the world is still divided in people who have 1,000’s of dollars of savings and people who have none. So when everyone turns to bitcoin, there will still be divided wealth. It’s only the hard cap of 21M bitcoins that gives it an honest value.

Yeah, that pizza incident probably catapulted bitcoin to where it's at today. And he paid 40 dollars in bitcoin, because that's simply what it was worth at the time.

I work at Bitcoin Inc. I will review your case with my supervisor. We only allow mentioning the Bitcoin registered trademark when it’s in a positive light.

Funny, as you’d think there’d be way more volume if this was all China’s doing.
Personally I think this sudden spike is all speculation because of the LTC halving and the FED cutting rates.
Don’t get me wrong, I want to see my sweet bitcoin rise in value just like you, but there’s got to be fundamentally more trading, or this spike will simply drop again. I say we revisit 10,000.

No offense, take this as a word of advice: if you’re struggling to make ends meet on a paycheck, there’s something you gotta change. Study for better work opportunities, move to a cheaper place to live, look where you can cut weekly/monthly expenses. If we’re not in a collapsing economy yet (although it’s most likely coming soon) you should always be able to save money.

I’m pretty sure that if it gets to 1 million, the dollar won’t even exist anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:49:30
What about cents? I thought ideally 100 satoshi = 1 dollar. But hey, 1 satoshi = 1 dollar would be better for my financial situation!
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:00:49
Following, as I have wondered about this too. But it's most likely statistically impossible.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:47:10
I learned about Bitcoin in December 2017 during an evening-long presentation and I was tricked into buying a small amount because it was going to go to 100,000 in 2018.
I am proud that I bit myself through 2018, started reading more and analyzing the market around March this year, and decided to invest way more into it. I feel like I've gotten truly dedicated to bitcoin at exactly the right time, and I am now HODLing for years to come.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:18:28
McAfee said December 2020, so he's even more bullish than my chart.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:38:53
He can sell me what he has for 4,000 if he’s so damn sure. He’d get so much profit out of it!
@_date: 2019-06-08 06:24:31
I know, I always keep in mind that Bitcoin does whatever it wants. But I like technical analysis, and when Bitcoin is in a longtime steady trend it does seem to follow the rules. 
Right now, the price is still within a downwards trend that I drew, and I will be interested for a final buy-back between 5,000 and 6,000, or when there's a clear signal that the downwards trend has been broken. After that, I will be HODLing for the ride. I believe we are in the final major correction before lift-off.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:35:13
Maaaan, idk. I realize bitcoin’s huge potential, but when a satoshi is not affordable anymore... isn’t it so that 100 million dollars per bitcoin is about the max value that it can reach in our lifetime? That would put it at 1 dollar per satoshi. So it would have to rise even times 10,000 from there. Sounds pretty farfetched, but me and my offsprings would be settled for generations to come.
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:24:01
What is "it"? You mean that's the bullish trendline that started on 1 April? Yes, it is a key moment to look out for a solid bounce. But I would not buy just yet.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:55:41
I know this is historically and technically reaching and unprecedented. But a HODLer can dream...
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:24:56
As far as I understood it, it’ll be backed by a number of fiat currencies. When one inflates it won’t have much effect. But if they all do, Facebook’s coin will inflate as well.
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:54:49
Hell yeah. Just get yourself your HODL amount, transfer to a private hardware wallet so you cannot touch it on a whim. And read up on technical analysis, draw some frigging trend, resistance and support lines on the hourly/daily/weekly charts and look at the past 2 years for this. It will make your life less stressful.
This correction was overdue and it will last several weeks or even months before we might rise significantly again. Or maybe we are just witnessing a last major spike in the bear market that started in 2018, and we go lower than 3,300 before the actual bull market starts.
Whichever way, know this: Bitcoin has never been worth less 4 years after buying. The statistics are still in our favour, but you need the strength to HODL for a long time if you are too emotional for trading.
AND DO NOT PUT MONEY INTO BITCOIN THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE.
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:12:35
Yes. Most likely. But it doesn’t matter in the long run.
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:55:12
He will in May 2020. The halving. Perfectly balanced.

Let’s just say that Warren Buffet had a minor change of heart about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:12:58
It's currently struggling against the 21 hourly EMA, its third attempt to break above it since the fall. This is a critical moment IMO, if it can't break above, the value is going to drop fast again.
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:20:05
I'm just speculating like anyone else. But it does not look good to me, I predict it will drop towards 7,000 next.
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:27:23
Many analysts believe a dip to 4k-3k levels is unavoidable in current conditions. However, this is bitcoin, young, playful and full of quirks. You cannot predict its value with absolute certainty.
The question is: do you want a quick profit by daytrading? Then you should probably wait and hope for the dip to happen.
If you believe in bitcoin and you are in for the long game, and if you have the stomach for occassional dips that could see your value cut in half, then buy now. I truly believe we're looking at a slow bumpy rise to a 5-figure value in the coming years.

I didn’t know about that functionality in hardware wallets yet, thanks!

This is just in case that literally EVERYONE has crypto after a huge devaluation of fiat. And not everyone feels comfortable being their own bank. I was thinking about my family when I asked myself these questions, including my siblings in their twenties.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:49:49
And if BTC drops, they will feel like idiots. BTC future may look bright at the moment, but it’s still very unpredictable. Don’t get caught in your emotions during investing, young Padawan.
@_date: 2019-05-05 09:37:44
Is TransferWise also an option maybe? Don’t know if they operate in China. Very low fees. Not as low as crypto though.
