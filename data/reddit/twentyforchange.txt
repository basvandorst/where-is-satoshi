This stuff is amazing. It is the real future of trade. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:05:51
Bitcoin is all about momentum. When it goes up, it goes up too far and when it goes down, it goes down too far. Use this too your advantage. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:37:53
This is odd considering that Russia Today seems to endorse it. Maybe not for much longer. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:46:53
Nice upvoting incorrect comments. More than 12.17 million coins have been mined approx 58% however there is only 29% of the 84m litecoins been mined. Please get your facts straight. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:47:23
Yeah complete anonymity is what is needed to rival the legacy banking systems. If bitcoin becomes big without anonymity the banks will just create lower fee systems to compete with bitcoin. Even though overall this would be a good outcome, full anonymity is better as there is just no way that the banks can compete with this as they will be legislated by the government. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:08:19
I'm with you too man. Around 20%. That is also what I have currently put into BTC. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 22:10:07
He says that he personally doesn't have any though from what I read on zerohedge, and that he has gold instead. I bet he bought just a few though to test it out :P
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:56:26
This guy is great! I love his take on some issues such as gun control, wikileaks and the US govt etc. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 12:47:43
Anyone know the cheapest place to buy bitcoins in Aus? I don't really feel like paying 10% in GST (goods and service tax) to Australian companies. Was thinking of something like this bitstamp overseas but will need to hope my bank will wire there. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:43:37
Free to leave and go where? There isn't a liveable scrap of land left on this earth that isn't claimed by a government. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:15:21
He doesn't necessarily do something for his own personal gain. It is good for all bitcoin users if the government controls less of them and I think that he knows this.
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:35:38
This is why I think alts like litecoin are useful. Half of the currency hasn't even been mined yet. Contrast this to bitcoin where satoshi has 10% of the coins and various other players like winkelvoss and there is a much fairer distribution of litecoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 07:32:37
USD is a currency and it isn't tipped over reddit. I don't see your point. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:11:37
So does this mean that they will be giving everyone 26% of their coins back? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:26:08
Nice, I might go check this out!
@_date: 2014-02-02 16:32:21
Here is another one to take a look at 
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:56:21
They have bitcoin in the related subreddits so maybe not? I think people forget that once the "crash to end bitcoin" supposedly happens everyone outside of this sub begins to forget that bitcoins exist. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:24:32
Why would we want to do this? We don't really have anything to gain from it. I believe most of the members of the panel already outlined the useful points and have seemed to convince him that it is okay for bitcoin to proceed in a regulated fashion. We do not need to do more that could risk or jeopardize this. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:51:41
Most currency is in a digital format now and I would imagine the electricity use of major banks would easily rival that of bitcoin if you think of all their servers and workplaces etc. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 10:51:39
No, Tigerdirect is next. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:39:35
I think anyone who trades on an anonymous russian exchange knows what they are getting in to. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 09:33:32
Nice! I just bought my phone from there a few months ago using dollars though... 
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:56:37
I like proof of work. It really comes down to using the most fundamental resource (energy) for determining the security of the currency. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 15:10:26
Well the goal is eventually bitcoin will have enough prevalence so that he can get paid in the currency. This will then mean that he does not need to trust banks / 3rd parties like credit card companies with his money. Hopefully improving efficiency and saving him money. This relies on the software infrastructure for the layperson being really easy to use though. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 13:20:04
Like I said they should keep the unknown group together and then when you mouse over it, it splits up into possible linked unknown addresses. This way you can still see that there is xx% of unknown mining and then further split this into something. Using the current display of data, there could be a 12% unknown group, a 5% unknown group and a few others so you have to group them up yourself to determine how much is actually unknown. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:29:21
Try and send me a few hundred USD to me here in Australia. Then try send me the same amount in bitcoin. Which would be easier do you think? 
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:19:30
Lol send people messages about their driving by adding a comment to your transaction on blockchain info.    
OI DICKHEAD THANKS FOR CUTTING ME OFF +1 satoshi. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:09:16
I think the difference is this time people will have a choice whether they put their bitcoin in traditional banks or not and there will be a lot of scepticism. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:37:30
Because their business relies on people forgetting their credit card subscription. I believe some sites have, and they have to increase the cost of the product when using bitcoin as it isn't a recurring payment. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:28:22
"Money without government appeals to people without law." No, it appeals to people that disagree with SOME laws. Just because people use it to exchange for illegal drugs that shouldn't even be illegal it does not make them violent criminals or murderers or even someone that you should be afraid of. 
"After all, banks are involved in almost all exchanges in today’s economies." Yes this is exactly what we are trying to change. These banks are given powers that no other businesses can have and have an insane amount of power over everyone that wishes to exchange wealth (practically everyone). 
@_date: 2014-11-14 12:52:01
What libraries did you use for your GUI? Looks nice. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:57:40
Great interview. Rick Falkvinge really knows what he is talking about with this kind of stuff. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:09:01
They aren't actually scrapping addresses just adding the payment protocol in addition to the current scheme.
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:59:23
Don't get too cocky yet. They hold a lot of power. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:03:44
This needs to be at the top. Mt. Gox is looking to divert attention from themselves and in doing some have done a lot of damage to the entire industry!
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:43:45
Kraken is still open so it shows that it is possible to get around this issue and that they should have prepared better. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:00:32
Yep I would still choose this over a US style tax payer bailout of the banks.
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:38:23
Because you asked how the US dollar even if it was a commodity currency would be less portable than bitcoin and I gave a possible scenario? 
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:40:11
Replacing unknown with a set of unknown addresses that can be linked isn't very useful. These could still be the same person and then you would think that it is more decentralized than it actually is. They should still have all the unknown grouped into 1 section but then further split up within that section.

Yeah so um, who is building a peer to peer encyclopedia then :P? 
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:50:02
Chill out its probably meant in a light hearted way. And even if it isn't I support his right to say it but will downvote him accordingly. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:30:30
I wouldn't trust the UN with my last two satoshis. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:39:24
Maybe primecoin? It depends how useful you think the prime numbers it generates are. It definitely could be used for useful computations however it might be hard to implement them. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 09:14:57
And now they have hundreds of thousands of coins to do with what they want. Thanks DPR. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 10:04:42
time to get some SSD's

@_date: 2013-11-20 06:00:33
Damn they worked fine last time i buy and i just put in another deposit today. I will see how it works out. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 08:58:13
How can he verify that it works if he only has part of the wallet that doesn't allow spending? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:29:55
I think 14 billion is a pretty generous population expectation...
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:22:38
It seems to have a bit of a different vibe. At least that is how it feels to me. Definitely less speculation. 
EDIT: Or maybe it just isn't there yet. Maybe wait a week or two. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:04:00
Wow this is a really low move. I was thinking about using them, but not any more. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:20:24
Definitely possible that a cause of these inflated volumes is people buying/selling their own coins for no fee. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:15:44
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:58:25
If you pay this much attention you either have to go all out and trade hard using quantitative methods. If you aren't prepared to do that just hold onto it. There is no point trading based off feelings. Why do you think it will go lower or higher? Do you have any reasoning or statistics behind that? 
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:54:35
Cya Western Union it was nice knowing you. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:24:32
Yeah lets just leave them to the criminals like the military and police. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 04:57:05
implying the gubmint and these corporations don't already steal more than this from us every year through taxation and corruption
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:50:44
Try and get a listing on  so that more people can find out about your service. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:04:10
This could do a lot of damage if this goes through and they achieve their goals. If this occurs we will just have another government funny money on our hands. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:18:53
My order was for coins at 461 and when I saw mtgox price dropped to 455 I was many happy :). 
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:23:38
Yeah anything you could do to make the key plaintext and usable the malware would be able to technically see too. I don't really see any way around this apart from avoiding having malware in the first place. (fuck using windows for interfacing with their API). Does anyone have any solutions&gt;? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:36:13
Free the money and you free the People. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:13:03
So bitstamps bank is in the country right? Will it affect them at all in any way?
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:55:52
Is the wallet going to be a full node or is it just going to get the blockchain off one of your servers somewhere? I appreciate the need for the quick setup when not running a full node however I feel that this debases your ideals.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:42:47
We should just go micro or we are going to have to do this again. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:13:35
Because it's nothing yet. Only 2b market cap is a drop in the ocean compared to the money that these large banks are handling. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:53:57
Yeh you had to realise it was going to happen after everyone was circle jerking over the chinese news and trying to spin it as good.
@_date: 2013-08-26 07:07:27
WebMoney supports bitcoin if I recall correctly. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:22:12
Yep this is a real fuck up by DPR. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:08:22
Why should they care that it's not backed by a government? It's a donation, anything should be better than none. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:48:22
What sites are you using? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:12:43
Not more of this coin validation shit again please no. Imagine if all USD that were obtained by illegal methods / drugs were not tradable. It would just not work.
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:02:05
Nice you actually seemed to have changed that guys opinion!
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:16:50
This isn't really capitalism, it is due to government control.
