Well, it that case we are in deeper shit than we imagine.
My deposit address is not on that list, but it is drained, with more than 100btc.

This is somehow impossible. If I had 80$ and agree to loose % of that in agreement to have 0% fee forever... I think you are joking. I have 140 BTC in BF in moment when theft occurred. How long should I trade to compensate loss? Maybe 1253 Years? With positive balance. Yeah, right. 0% fee is a good idea but not viable.

It is valid option, I have nothing more to say, then, must agree.

It is weekend, they do not work on weekends. :)

I also can agree with this, there are a lot of furthermore "but what  if" that should be explained. BFX tokens can be a part of a good plan, if BitFinex agree to buy them back with their profit money at defined price or terms.

Absolutely agree. My biggest concern is that hole in security, is it fixed for sure. After everything settles down, will you explain to us how the hell this whole shit happened?
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:55:41
Could be possible :(

He or she can send me back mine, I will not bother him/her. And will be very happy and pleased.

Most secure way to withdraw funds is to communicate with account holders and manually allow withdraw. I really have no idea what is hacked at all. Maybe accounts also? You must be very very careful once site is up again.

I have been with BitFinex since nearly start, as trader and lender. We had some really good time together. Rise and falls. First wish is for BitFinex to survive, second to cover their and our losses. I have more than 140BTC in the time of this hack. Can you imagine how shitty this situation is. All my savings and investments I put there. Do I regret? Well, I do regret because of this theft, but not in global. Can I sleep at night? Hell NO. But I realize situation. Zane did hell of a job here. I only could imagine pressure he takes. And wish to thank him for that. As I see this situation, it can be only one way out of crisis. BitFinex must stand tall, and we should all cooperate. Yes, talking like a life is a fairy tale, but what are other options? I am also a bit angry on how the hell this was possible. You are not some 3rd class exchange! Recover quickly and put BF online as soon as possible. These days I have no other life than reading reddit and Zane posts. Once again, thank You Zane.

Something to think about! Nice one Mentor77.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:39:11
I must agree with this.

I hope that Zane is just about to update, otherwise paranoid mind will come again to me.
