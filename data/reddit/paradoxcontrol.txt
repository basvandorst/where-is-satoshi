Soon the school will be filled with bathroom stall transactions taking place over QR Codes and Nearfield for the sale of candy and other contraband. How could the administration stop them! They can't even confiscate the coins!

This doesn't really illustrate much of anything. If you cut all the short parts about bitcoin out you would just have a couple shopping for $50 worth of food. There was no information given about the process involved. I can go to any store and see people shop for groceries.

As someone who only dabbles in Bitcoin at the moment, I can say this nomenclature would definitely make it easier for me to communicate what Bitcoin is and how much I have to people who have no clue about Bitcoin at all. 
I have had people ask after a conversation starts about bitcoin "Oh, well do you have any Bitcoin?" My answer is usually fumbled or vague and probably doesn't help my conversation at all. Mostly because I have no words to denote just how "little" i have relative to how much 1BTC is worth. 
Being able to say to them "Yeah, I have about 22080 bits. It sounds like a lot, but 1BTC is equal to 1,000,000 bits. Kind of like how you look at the price of things in Yen and all the costs look 'high' even though they might not be."
Regardless of how the community accepts this, I'll be using it in my conversations going forward.

These seem interesting. I was recently trying to utilize some old devices I have for mining but turns out they are either not covering there electric cost or just don't work. The $100 USB miner would almost double the speeds I get from my desk top. Is it a sound idea to buy one with the idea of using it to pay for another down the road? I'd like to get started mining and this seems like a nice option.
