Making almost 50x return on a "investment" should not be mocked, that is insanely good. But yeah hindsight is a bitch.

Yes, pointing out that you have"7.62x54mm corrosive Soviet ammo" was *very* relevant to the discussion, not at all worthy of Sure it is more likely that you get robbed at the ATM, but that a entirely different kind of crime. Which realistically wont get the criminals that much cash. Due to limits, how much money even is available to take out for you card, hell your bitcoin might very well be worth more than the total amount of cash in a ATM.
The entire point of the PSA is that large amount of bitcoins can make you the target different kind of crime. After all people are kidnapped, the main problem with a kidnapping is that is hard to get way it. And generally it hard to rob people for large amount of money, as you don't store you millions in cash at home. Bitcoin makes this a possibility, thus you can become a target if it is known that you have a lot if bitcoins.

You cant take out that much money in a atm, it is not the same.

Was Sayoshis statement really wrong tho? In late 2010 3k Bitcoin was pocket change.

Bitcoin is a bit different from other assets tho, if you have your money in the bank it quite hard to steal it and be able to spend it. 
If it is know that you are worth a million dollars might not be that big a risk, but you should be a lot more careful letting people know that you have a million dollars in gold (or cash) at home, same goes for bitcoin.

Other early adopters should also have so much that 42 bitcoins are pocket change. Big part of silk roads time bitcoin traded for $10, and then the user base was reasonably big, a couple of them must have hold on to there coins.

The tokens would be centralized in some way tho, either the government are gonna recognize it as legally binding or the company can fork/make a new token for its stocks. So realistically if you pull a big heists you wont really get a way with it. So no crazy heists like some stealing +50% of all Apple stock and end up owning it.  
But still good for smaller things, but I doubt you can get a way with Mtgox level stuff.

So we should look to McAfee for guidance on how to not act childishly? Hmmm

I wont argue that derivatives dont have a larger value than gold, that is no doubt true. But you cant really quantify derivatives value with the market cap of them, that is plainly devious.

I think Mt GOX taught us, the hard way, that mixing BTC and MTG is a bad idea.

If you cashed out 1 billion dollar, sure then you are someone.

If someone tried to cash out even 1b the market would crash hard tho, that is about 200 days of block rewards.
