This actually came from my own email address. It's not hard to fake where an email is originating from. So if I reply it'll arrive at my own inbox.

In 2029, people will talk about how a guy brought a pizza and a drink for 380k sats back in 2019.

I know right? I gotta say email is very convincing. It has a password I used a long time ago. So I would be panicking too if I was jerking off in front of my PC. But I prefer TV ;)
Also, I changed that password some 5 - 6 years ago.

I'm from Sri Lanka. Only way we Sri Lankans can cashout is through localbitcoins.com. It's the only way rn.
And if you want to save some more on fees, you can do the trade on localbitcoins and have buyer deposit cash to beneficiary's account in Sri Lanka.

Am I the only person who doesn't know what the hell  **proof of key** is?

I never heard of coin.lk before. I paid a quick visit just now. Looks okay, but can't recommend them.

I want to buy Bitcoin with PayPal. I would be interested to buy from you if there is a safe method.

Sounds like a good idea.
I don't know what kind of computer littature your beneficiary has, but knowing people here, I assume it's not high. So these bitcoin stuff might sound alien to them.
I strongly suggest doing the trade yourself and have the buyer on localbitcoins deposit money to beneficiary's account.
And you don't need Coinbase Pro or shared accounts. You can buy btc on localbitcoins and sell them to a buyer in Sri Lanka. This will avoid unnecessary transactions.
I'll be buying some btc on localbitcoins around 15th this month. So inbox me if you're doing the trade around that time.

It actually works. The restriction is only on the registration page. So once you're in you login with US IP.
I get the referral, you get the account.
Anyways, no big deal :|
Good luck getting rekt tho.

Legit or not, I'm sick of people spamming this for referral bonus. This and that Ledger 30% discount.
