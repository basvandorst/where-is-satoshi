Can you elaborate? I understand john nash was fundamental in the field of game theory, but I'm not sure how that applies.
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:26:57
That still doesn't change what I said though. The creator of the wheel wouldn't necessarily be a proponent of self-driving cars.

I'm not sure I catch your meaning. If it was a matter of Darwinism, and your existence encroached on my existence, then we'd both be in a state of self-defense until we either reached a state of equilibrium or one side was vanquished. If it was a matter of morality, I don't think either side could be justified over the other.

The wrong kind
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:55:37
Alan Turing didn't end world war 2, although he aided in it's end significantly. Computing is not eliminating fiat currency. Fiat currency will never be eliminated. The closest thing you'll see is an amalgamation between the two.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:46:55
What would compensation look like? As far as I know, apologies have been made regarding the treatment of Alan Turing with the former PM of the UK describing his treatment has "Horrifying" and "Inhumane". I suppose though, due to the amount of injustices occurring today, that they can't really be forgiven. 
I would agree with you that the most important project for humanity is to develop a system which allows for peace and morality, without the need for violence and immorality. But is that possible? Evil will always be out there, and any system designed to deal with this evil, will be susceptible to corruption. I would agree that the separation of money and state is a good idea if executed properly, although I doubt whether or not it is possible. 
Perhaps you could elaborate further on your last point? Maybe I am more brainwashed than most, but I don't believe that such a strong "ruler-subject" dynamic exists in this day and age (at least in the modern civilized world). I also believe that suffering will exists regardless.

I'd agree with the ability for cryptocurrencies to circumvent various restrictions  put in place by state (not only by other state actors but by individuals as well), but I don't see it as having the potential to replace fiat. John Nash's theory of ideal money will give me a bit to read and think about though. I try to keep an open mind.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:49:33
The problem with your mindset is this "us or them" mentality, which is common among anarchists. The fact is, if the state (in its current form) were to collapse, another would take its place. Cryptocurrency isn't going to result in any radical political change. Additionally, the state that chemically castrated alan turing for a homosexual relationship isn't at all the same state that exists today. Does that mean that our state is free from evils? No, but to attribute past actions to this current state is illogical. Whether or not there is a turing coin (which, [there is]( is irrelevant to my point. Many individuals in this thread are stating outright that Alan Turing would have been a huge proponent to cryptocurrency. Maybe he would of, maybe not, but why make that assumption for any other reason than to contribute to the ad populum surrounding crypto.
If immediately following the death of alan turing, the government turned around and added him to our currency, then yes, it would have been ironic. But the global populous has changed, as has the states which represent them. 
Your final comment is what I find to be most concerning, and is what I'm talking about with regards to the "Us or Them" mentality which is so pervasive among crypto-anarchists (most in the cryptocurrency space). I am no lover of the governments which control the world, and am well aware of the corruption, and human-rights violations that occur. But at the same time I am also aware of the fact that many people within the government are people like you and me, who just want to see a change in the world for the better. If the state is replaced, it will be replaced by another state that will invoke the same anarchist sentiments seen today. Cryptocurrency may help circumvent economic sanctions, and allow for citizens to regain control of their privacy (to some extent), but it will never overthrow the bankers, the government, or fiat currency. What you will see, as I have stated numerous times today, is an amalgamation between the two, similar to what Ripple is doing. 
Additionally; When you say Turing is one of "ours", who does that refer to? People interested in cryptocurrency? Citizens? Computer-Nerds? Turing is one of the world, as are we all.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:22:34
That doesn't make it worth more. All cryptocurrencies are easier to transact with than gold. That doesn't mean all cryptocurrencies are valuable.
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:08:02
You've definitely given this more thought than me. Is having a leader such a bad thing though? I just can't even imagine a world in which fiat currency exists in any state subservient to crypto. If fiat currency was to be bypassed, it would cease to exist. As for the state, I would be curious to hear you elaborate on your thoughts on a world without a state. Would there still be a rule of law? Would the court system still exist? How would disputes be settled? Who will regulate abuses of power? I don't doubt the plausibility of anarchism, but would like to see it expressed a little clearer. While in an ideal world nobody would wield the lethality and cruelty of state, I don't see it as being possible. Even if government's worldwide were to be abolished, there would still be collections of power. There is so much power that is held in the world today, I don't think we can revert to a time before it. What would happen to the nuclear arsenals of the world? If they were all destroyed, and governments subsequently abolished, how long before another organization manages to build their own Manhattan project? I'd agree that war is a game of power and not one of righteousness, but isn't that sometimes required? I'd like to understand the anarchists perspective of the world, but I struggle when it comes to issues of monopolization and organizations which manage to obtain power (whether it be of finance, influence, or force). How would an anarchist state respond to the threat of foreign invasion? 
I see the bad that the governments are responsible for, but I also see the bad that they prevent. I don't believe that a state of total anarchy is desirable either, as those with the ability to seize power will continue to do so. I'm not so much defending the state as I am defending against the absence of it. I don't believe that in its current iteration, or any iterations of past, that it was free from evil.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:20:49
You made several false statements followed by fantastical assumptions. Whose comment was useless?
\- The creator of the computer was Charles Babbage, not Alan Turing.
\- The creator of modern cryptography as it relates to cryptocurrency is the NSA using the Merkle–Damgård construction, not Alan Turing.
 \- No one person or event ended world war 2, but a combination of Hitler's suicide and the following bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the events which led to the end of World War 2. Not Alan Turing.
 \- Cryptocurrency isn't eliminating fiat currency. Erroneously, you use the term paper money, which is being eliminated by debit/credit cards. Fiat Currency however is still going strong and is under no threat. There may be an amalgamation between the two, such as cryptocurrency being used to represent fiat currency, as is the case with Ripple.

What an unintelligent post
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:51:47
Unfortunately that is the response I end up getting from a lot of anarchists. They want to abolish the state, but have no plan on what to do after. I'd say that your cotton analogy is an over simplification of my perspective. My problem is this: How do we know with absolute certainty that the absence of state would overall be beneficial to the well-being of the people? While states may commit atrocities, how do we know that a better solution exists? Frankly, this is a problem I see with many political ideologies. Take communism for example. Means of production controlled by the state and the forced redistribution of wealth. In the ideal communist-world, everyone is employed, having received free post-secondary education. In reality, corruption ends up becoming prevalent. If states are abolished, it would only be a matter of time before power becomes isolated to a few individuals, and we'd be back to a monarchy with absolute authority, and a complete lack of democracy. In short, if we don't agree to elect representatives, they will choose to represent us anyway.

I'll have to check all that out and look into it further. I don't doubt you, but I like forming my own conclusion on things. 
Personally I believe that everyone has the right to ruler-ship over their own domain, but I wouldn't consider myself an anarchist. 
I'd agree with your last point, but I'm not sure I understand what you're implying. Some people may argue otherwise and suggest that might is equal to right but I don't agree with that, at least not as a philosophy. I believe that unfortunately an intrinsic property of life is that it is the "survival of the fittest".
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:04:17
I'll be honest. I'm not familiar with much of what you're saying. I would however be interested in reading more about it. Could you provide a link to the specific proof that you're talking about? Additionally, can you provide any further information about the government's pursuit of Nash? Often times when I read about these highly intelligent individuals who end up developing mental disorders, there are always conspiracy theories surrounding their lives, more often than not eluding to government interference. This is why I treat everything I read with a grain of salt. I'll check out that movie, but would be interested in hearing what you believe is wrong with it. Also, I was unable to find any information about this money system you speak of that he devised.

How is the intrinsic value of gold at all comparable to bitcoin?

@_date: 2019-07-15 20:23:16
I'll be honest I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around all of this at the moment, but I agree with you that we should have a right to choose our medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:55:40
Soon extinct and worthless? Hardly. Cryptocurrencies will never "replace" fiat. At best we will see some sort of amalgamation. Additionally, just because Alan Turing is the father of cryptography, it doesnt mean that he would be a supporter of cryptocurrencies, although I'd be willing to bet he'd at the very least be intrigued. This association between alan turing and crypto is presumptuous and in my opinion, disrespectful.

My tip would be; if you don't know how to answer this question yourself, you don't know enough about investing, or bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:19:47
I can understand that I suppose. I'm feeling mentally fatigued anyway. I would like it however if you returned to this conversation at a later date, as this is something I've been wanting to explore further for a while.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:06:48
How does that change what I said?
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:03:41
Again, that doesnt give it value. It is because it is. Not because of any intrinsic value. Bitcoin **will** be replaced one day
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:05:26
That's a very good idea. Too much time is wasted investigating beyond first appearances to see if there's more to be learned.

You're missing the point. Physical currency vs digital currency arent comparable, including when speaking about atms
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:36:46
How can anyone know what the most accurate prediction is?
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:06:11
Except not really. Fiat currency as a system compared to bitcoin is a different story then the concept of physical currency.
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:46:46
Whether or not an atm is working has no effect on the currency as a whole, and is common with any type of machine. A bitcoin atm could just as easily go down

@_date: 2019-06-07 15:18:45
Why is bitcoin "amazing" technology?
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:57:50
You're missing the point entirely, still. My point wasnt about fiat vs bitcoin. It was about physical fiat compared to digital bitcoin. Of course the process for recieving physical currency isnt comparable to the trading of digital currencies. And of course that process will be more cumbersome. This is about an atm that dispenses cash vs a bitcoin atm. They simply arent comparable. This isnt about the comparison between fiat and cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:32:37
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:11:14
Exactly, making people sell lower in order to get out. No one will buy bitcoin at 100k, or even 50k
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:02:27
Who's going to buy at 100k?
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:15:55
100k is unreasonable, too many people will sell, and it would collapse. Fall to 1k is much more likely, and possible.
@_date: 2019-06-14 19:49:07
Of course he does
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:38:39
In the end, they're just predictions, and the market can go either way. Make enough predictions and some of them are bound to be correct.

What security does bitcoin have that could not easily be replicated, if not to even stronger levels of security, by other coins? I'll admit my knowledge on the subject has been lacking lately, but I'm not aware of anything in bitcoin that makes it more secure than say, Monero.
I really only think the only thing making bitcoin king is lack of any useable competitor. If another cryptocurrency was created that met all the standards of bitcoin and thensome, which had widespread adoption, for everyday expenses, then it could replace bitcoin. I dont think it requires a miracle, I just think it takes the right mind
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:05:32
Not really. 100k was just the value we were talking about. I think most would sell long before then. If not, why didnt more people hold when it was at 20k?
