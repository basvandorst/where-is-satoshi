Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:55:48
Good to know. Thank you for sharing!
Side note: can you recommend any good resources for deepening one’s understanding of the technical details of BTC?  
I know code well enough to write simple programs, but I’m definitely no developer.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:51:20
I don’t see any reason why there should be only one winner in the long run. It’s much more likely that different coins will come about for different niches.
Maybe one for international payments, one for everyday small purchases, one for major purchases like lambos (what I see as the BTC niche), one for future purchase arrangements, and so on.
There’s no point in being the king of crypto, if there are no other coins to rule, after all.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:41:12
That I didn’t know, but then do we end up with another fork fight?
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:26:52
I’d imagine you just tell them it’s a specialized computer, maybe compare it to a router. 
Most people are tech stupid, so any plausible story delivered convincingly should be enough.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:39:37
Does this matter if you’re just holding (for now), or does it only come into play once you’re actually sending coins to other people?
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:17:58
Crypto is money, sure, but it’s also an engineering effort. It’s well known that all engineering decisions involve trade offs.  There’s no perfect device that has every feature and is also the best example of each of those features. 
I can’t predict exactly what will happen in the long run, but I see no reason why crypto should break the generally accepted truths of engineering.
One obvious downside to BTC as an everyday transaction medium is its limited supply. Even breaking it down to satoshis, once you factor in entropy (destruction of coins over time) and population growth, the risk of running short of bitcoins to deal with the whole world’s daily transactions  is not unreasonable. 
On top of that, the entropy should be expected to increase as transaction volume increases given that each transaction is an opportunity for coins to be accidentally destroyed. This is why large but infrequent transactions seem like a better niche for BTC.  
To me, an ideal crypto for everyday use would lack a coin cap, but have a creation rate cap, not to create inflation, but to compensate for coin destruction in the same manner that a mint would periodically replace gold-backed money when it gets worn out.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:12:26
That makes sense, but that’s also only a matter of the maturity of the crypto exchange industry, wouldn’t you agree?
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:46:00
I’m definitely approaching crypto from an economic perspective more than a technical one, so I couldn’t really say about side chains. 
One issue I see here is that the average person may never understand what you just said, and may prefer to use multiple coins than learn all the details of one coin with a lot of difficult-to-understand features.
So, even if it’s technically feasible, it may not be psychologically appealing, and that’s a major factor to consider.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:40:32
I was under the impression there is a hard limit at the satoshi

This hurts, but I’m still hodling
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:30:15
And given that the major run-up was entirely in 2017, I doubt many people had 2017 tax plans that accommodated these gains.  I strongly expect another dip in a few days.  Get ready folks!
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:09:41
Isn't tax an interesting topic?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:18:03
Ethereum does have inflation limits though. Doge has neither.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:42:32
Oh, so you mean it's beneficial to take profits in order to absorb all the available deductions generated by their business activities.  Is that right?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:52:26
Please consult a tax professional on crypto issues.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:42:48
I don't really do charts, but I do love when crypto goes on sale.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:39
Having an open ended coin limit but a restricted issue rate is a good thing. A mild new issue rate effectively serves in the same role as a mint would for a gold-backed currency. It continuously replaces unserviceable notes to maintain a stable physical supply.
Because crypto can be lost in a manner that equates to total destruction, some method of replacement is necessary for a day-to-day currency. Coins like BTC will eventually risk running into problems of shortage as private keys are inevitably lost. That makes it likely to continue growing in value over the long run (via deflation), but also serves to diminish its attractiveness for day-to-day use. It is very much like gold in that respect.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:47:41
Crypto has already helped people in Brazil and Venezuela. It will no doubt help many more people in the years to come, but it’s important not to disparage those who seek to profit from it. 
That profit amounts to the return of stolen wealth from the political class to the economic class, and it has been members of the economic class (from honest laborers to true capitalists) who have historically done the most to lift the world’s most vulnerable from the depths of poverty.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:37:29
A lot of these things are mentioned in books related to value investing and/or behavioral finance.  They're all very good pieces of advice.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:19:57
That would only apply to people who bought at a price higher than $13k though, given current prices.  It only breeched $13k for the first time earlier this month.  The only people who would benefit from that tactic are those who bought very recently, though I do understand where you're coming from.  Does the 31 day rule apply to crypto though?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:33:06
That’s a fair assessment
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:31:12
Take your time and hire the right people.  You're going to be able to afford it lol.  You'll want a tax pro to help you figure out when and how to sell, and if you don't know what to do with the money, you might also need a good financial advisor (fee-only, not commissioned) to help you decide where to put it.  I doubt you'll need an attorney, but you may.  If your gain is significant you'll likely want to update your will at the very least.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:46:37
I take it back.  You're worse than the Tumblr crowd.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:27:19
Fair point.  I do tend to assume that anyone speaking English on the internet is American.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:12:54
That makes total sense, I just don't expect that to be a majority circumstance.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:37:11
I've just been operating under the assumption that any exchange will be treated as a taxable event and acting accordingly.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:14:49
Now that makes sense, but it would only apply to people who bought above $13k or so. Hardly disciplined investor behavior.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:22
Seems like an opportunity to me. Why not trade Bcash, and reinvest the gains into more BTC? I mean if you don’t believe in the coin, no need to hodl, so why not exploit it help you get more of the real Bitcoin?
This just makes it easier.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:12:07
Good point.  There are probably a good number of lucky crypto owners that made a ton in gains but don't make a lot in salary, so they would be able to take advantage of the 0% rate, though I doubt many in that situation are likely to be sufficiently aware of long-term capital gains rates to take advantage of them.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:49:51
I look forward to seeing what comes of this
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:35:19
Well, at that point it would make the more sense to just wait for long-term capital gains rates.  Then you're capped at 20% for very high earners, and 15% for a lot of others making slightly less jaw-dropping incomes.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:51:15
Ah, ok.  That makes sense.  Still though, I'd imagine the number of taxpayers in that situation would be a minority and unlikely to be able to significantly affect the market like we are seeing now.  Do you have an estimate of how common this situation might be? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:16:26
I've got funds just sitting and waiting for the dip I expect.  The anticipation is palpable, but I'm also very happy that I'm managing not to rush in.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:51:47
That would also make sense.  If they need more gains to soak up all the credits that won't be available in the future, that's also a sensible reason to sell.
I'm expecting that there will be a much steeper drop in early January though, also for tax reasons.  Many people will find themselves in lower ordinary income brackets making short-term capital gains taxes less of a burden if they wait to sell.  They'll also push back their tax liability by a year and have a whole year to figure out how to offset those gains somehow (perhaps by buying new depreciable assets).  It may also be the case that the bcash crowd knew this and intentionally timed their attack to cause a crash just prior to year-end in order to achieve back-to-back crashes and undermine confidence in core.   If this is true, we may be on the cusp of a beautiful buying opportunity, but of course only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:47:45
That's true, but I'd expect that those people would not make up the majority of taxpayers, nor of HODLers.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:18:54
Good luck fellow Redditor!
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:48:22
Why would you prefer to take profits in 2017? If you waited a few weeks till 2018 you’d push back paying taxes for another whole year. What’s the supposed benefit of accelerating your tax payments?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:22:02
It’s designed to achieve a stable and moderate inflation rate over the long term. This is a good thing as it means that destruction of ether tokens won’t lead to an eventual shortage that threatens the network (which may become and issue for BTC/LTC/etc. further into the future). As such, Ethereum is my top pick for everyday use, while I see BTC as digital gold (and why I reject BCH).
I’m a little fuzzy on some of the details, but I think that’s right. I’m stronger on the economics of crypto than on the technical details.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:10:53
Doge doesn’t do enough to limit the inflation rate. It’s less like a mint replacing damaged bills and more like that and additional notes also being generated by central bank policy.
The ideal inflation rate for crypto is a very small positive to serve as replacement for destroyed coins only. If the rate is too high, now you’re printing fiat, which will prevent appreciation of the coin. That’s what I was trying to say.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:10:32
Yeah, but why would you worry about that?  It's not like you'd ever be in a situation where you're selling at a gain and would end up without enough cash from the sale to pay your taxes.  This approach also ignores the time-value of money.  Taxes paid now cost more than the same taxes paid in the future.  Sure, it would feel like a less intimidating tax bill if you pay it every year, but you'd actually end up paying more (once you consider the opportunity cost) than if you simply paid one large bill when you finally cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:54:47
Are you confident that’s a defensible tax position?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:37:19
I'm sure that happens in plenty of cases, but I doubt those circumstances are the norm.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm looking at the aggregate effect on the market price originating from the behavior of the bulk of investors, not suggesting that there are no investors who would be right to take gains right now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:33:06
The 31-day rule is the one that says if you sell stock at a loss you can't buy it back for 31 days and still count the loss.
This thread is getting messy for me... did you mention above that the purpose of recognizing the gain is to absorb all deductions and credits available in 2017?  To offset losses in other ventures, right?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:59:55
Depends on the rest of your tax situation.  
The bit where it says, "... if they expect to owe tax of $1,000 or more when their return is filed." is the important bit.  
There are lots of ways to legitimately expect to owe less than $1000 of tax depending on what else you are doing during the year.
Also, if anyone takes tax advice off Reddit without hiring an actual tax advisor (as I've recommended multiple times throughout this thread), they are an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:30:33
Well, for starters, how about you identify which of the nine schools of thought you’re referring to when you use the word ‘economics’.
The one my argument is based on is called the Austrian school.
And, while the duty is not yours to explain my argument, it is your responsibility to specifically identify which part of my argument you question and present a coherent challenge against that specific point rather than attacking me generally. That’s not a respectable way to argue.
As a bonus, I’ll give you a brief overview of why I believe in the tenets of the Austrian school: during the mid 20th century, there was a significant disagreement among scholars as to whether it is more appropriate to approach questions of human behavior from a philosophical perspective, defining things primarily through language and the use of formal logic, or to approach these questions as engineering problems using applied mathematics.  I hold as a fundamental belief that the reduction of human behavior to that which is readily quantifiable leads to gross oversimplification.  
The specific reason Austrian school adherents believe in markets is because they are products of spontaneous order and therefore capable of becoming orders of magnitude more complex than any widely accepted mathematical models in use today.  This is why hiring a bunch of physicists and mathematicians doesn’t let you reliably beat the stock market over the long run, and a stock market is still substantially simpler than an overall economy. It’s also why no one can reliably predict the weather; there are just too many variables to account for.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:07:44
I get where you're coming from with the Austrailia reference, but there's also the population disparity.  America has about 13x as many people as Australia (323M vs 24M), so that's probably why Australians don't have this same tendency.
I did neglect to mention the population issue though, so thank you for presenting that point.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:37:56
Can you explain this in more detail? I’m better at the economics than the computer science when it comes to cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:36:19
I've been a landlord for 4 years.  I don't even know my tenant's names.  My property manager handles everything except approval of expenditures over a certain threshold.  No maintenance calls, no waking up in the middle of the night, none of that.
I wish you the best in your trading, and future ventures.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:51:18
You're allowed to exclude a certain amount of capital gains, but that allowance doesn't roll over from year-to-year.  Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:18:45
Why would it be beneficial to sell, trigger a tax liability and invest in something else with the intent to offset taxes? Are you saying they should prefer to rebalance because they expect higher gains in altcoins? That really doesn’t seem like disciplined investor behavior at all. It seems like herding amateur investor behavior.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:45:30
Or you can wait till you’ve held for a year to get a 15% rate on sale at an income level of $250k, which is clearly better.
I sincerely hope you don’t make that much money and still know so little about taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:22:05
Without a coin cap, they’ll never meaningfully appreciate
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:30:45
Well, have you considered rental property?  Rental expenses are above-the line deductions which will reduce your AGI.  You get to take depreciation on rental properties even if the building is actually appreciating in value.  You can hire a property manager and stay largely hands-off, but the deductions can offset your trading income.
I promise, it's worth your time and money to go find a really good tax advisor.  Shop around, and find one that loves the tax code and wants to help you save money.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:19:18
2018 is going to be a fun year, I think.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:18:53
I don’t believe so. 
Both inflate, but my understanding is that Ethereum has better controls in place to limit the rate of inflation. Doge was not meant to be a serious coin, which is probably why the developers didn’t worry about making sure there were adequate controls in place to deal with the inflation rate.
The difference is basically that Ethereum has one important feature that Doge lacks: a rate limiter.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:21:35
Then you're going to have to segregate your gains.  Some will be long-term, and others will be short-term.  Do you have records of when you bought the long-term coins and when you sold them?
Shop around for a good tax pro to let you know what you need to dig up in terms of records.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:33:23
Because January gains won’t be taxed till 2019, December gains get taxed in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:32:39
Very true, but by it's very nature that strategy limits the amount of holdings that can be sold.  Do you think that would be enough to crash the price?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:46:23
I think it's really a geographical thing.  It's not like in Europe where visiting other countries is a matter of taking a short road trip.  I think most of the rest of the world doesn't really realize how much of an ordeal international travel is for us.
Also, I sort of subconsciously expect foreign English speakers to use unfamiliar idioms like those used by the British so if I don't see those, I end up assuming I'm speaking to an American, or maybe a Canadian.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:49:30
I invest in a manner inspired by value-investing principles, so I'd disagree with you on that but I do respect your point of view.

Care to actually name an economic concept you believe is relevant, and of which you believe me ignorant or are you content to merely rant?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:45:52
Very true
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:35:27
I'm not a tax professional, only a grad student in accounting, so I may be wrong, but I don't believe that gains taxed at preferential rates are included in your AGI.  It's only ordinary income that accumulates there (if I remember correctly) since you're using the ordinary income tax tables at the end of the calculation to determine your tax liability.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:49:22
I would LOVE that dip. Diiiiiiiiiipppppp!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:36:32
Exactly which part of the tax plan would cause this reaction?  Can you cite a specific change that you believe would cause it to be advantageous to sell in 2017 versus 2018?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:10:31
An actual trader who needs to hire a better tax advisor.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:31:32
Fair point
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:42:01
Right, but do you think there are enough of them to cause major market fluctuations?  
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:18:56
You can’t, but you can add other ventures that generate offsetting short-term paper losses (such as through depreciation) in order to lower your AGI until you’re in a lower bracket.
I’m not trying to be an asshole, I really think you need a better tax advisor.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:19:43
Yeah, I looked into it a bit further and you are correct.  I was wrong above.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:54:28
I see where you’re coming from. I don’t actually trade currently, so that is not an issue for me. I’ve only been buying this year, not selling.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:41:37
What if, instead, working 50-60 hour weeks for a reasonably period, say a year, was enough to let you make a major upgrade? Save a down payment for a house, build up an emergency fund or set aside enough money to start a business?  Wouldn’t that be even better?
That’s what less government would allow you to accomplish. Hell, that’s probably a very conservative estimate of what you’d be able to accomplish if not for regulations making housing, cars, healthcare and pretty much every basic necessity more expensive, legal hurdles making it more expensive to start a business, and government taking a major chunk of your income through taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:32:28
Possible, but unlikely. I think you’re forgetting about the difference between short and long term capital gains rates.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:35:41
What do you mean that business investments provide an ability to offset taxes?  I don't see how that's true unless there were losses on those investments, or you're talking about depreciable personal property which would not apply to crypto.  It would apply to mining hardware, but that's a deduction you can take regardless of whether or not you sell anything.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:05:07
I don't believe that's quite correct.  My understanding is that the $425k limit refers to the taxpayer's level of ordinary income and doesn't include capital gains.  The $900k in BTC would only trigger the 20% rate if the taxpayer also made a $425k in business or salary income as well.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:40:52
You're making the liberty movement look bad everytime you behave like this.  You're only slightly less irritating than the Tumblr crowd.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:49:06
I’m saying less regulation results in fewer barriers to innovation. It frees people to earn a living using the skills they already possess or are willing to cultivate without needing anyone’s explicit permission.  That freeing up of creative and productive potential leads to greater earnings on average.
Simply put, it’s an indirect causal chain, not a direct one.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:50:19
Fair enough.  If you don't think they're going to rebound, then selling now would be wise.  Personally, I hold a different expectation.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:48:28
That doesn't make sense though.  They could delay the sale until the first week of January and still have the cash well before April 15th.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:55:35
But what is the reason to prefer doing it now rather than in a week or two? It makes sense to dump losses right now, but not gains.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:15:22
I'm not either, merely a grad student in the major.  I could very well be wrong, which is why I strongly recommend hiring a good tax advisor if you have a large enough amount of gains.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:09:09
It is based on the net result, that's correct.  The only issue with tracking trades is defending yourself in an audit.  Documentation is very valuable in that case, because in an audit the burden is on you to prove you didn't under report.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:50:45
I believe this is only true if you sell under short-term capital gains rules.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:20:26
Agreed, my friend, but shouting on the internet is not the best way to entice others to follow us to our inevitable and glorious victory.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:53:24
I do not.  I've never heard of it.
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:57:02
But you still can, if you find value in the relationship. I’d also consider trusting some credit unions and some community banks. 
Bitcoin isn’t likely to kill banks, but it is likely to serve as a powerful incentive for banks to get honest again and stay that way.
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:24:21
The fact that you choose to link this paper without summarizing the assumptions I keep asking about strongly implies you actually can't read it yourself.
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:50:32
I don’t need citations to prove that falling prices are a good thing. That’s obvious.
I also don’t need them to contradict the assumptions taken by mainstream economics regarding human behavior because they’re assumptions.
The deflationary spiral argument ignores time preference in consumption. Time preference and expectations of future growth in purchasing power are opposing psychological forces that balance at a certain equilibrium depending on their magnitude.
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:33:34
The deflation threat is a fraud. If it were true no one would ever buy any technology, given that technologies such as TVs already behave in a deflationary manner, yet they’re still purchased all the time.
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:21:38
Well, in that case, I'm not arguing with someone who refuses to reveal their axioms.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:29:37
That’s true of all goods, but unlike most commodities gold is durable and has a very stable supply (gold mining only gradually increases it). This is why it makes ideal money.
It’s true that the price of gold has varied significantly in recent years, but that doesn’t mean the value of gold has changed in the eyes of the general public. It could also mean that the value of the dollar has changed in the eyes of the public, it just depends on which one you see as being fundamentally more stable.
After all, a price is ultimately just an exchange rate.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:08:30
What needs to change is that we need to stop punishing saving. Saving is a good, responsible practice. 
Furthermore, we need to stop artificially encouraging investing because that’s how we get bubbles. If an investment is worthwhile, it will be undertaken by someone with excess savings who wants a better return.
Additionally, since it punishes saving, inflation encourages taking on more debt, which good for banks and bad for consumers in the long-run because they’ll have to pay interest on top of the purchase price of whatever they buy.

And?  If supply creates its own demand, as Say's law suggests, then the contractions you reference could just as easily be credited to limitations on production.  Observations never offer information on their own.  Observations require analysis, which can easily be wrong.  If you're going to point to observations you still have the burden of providing an argument in favor of your interpretation of those observations.

With respect to the assumptions, I'm talking about things like defining "rational" economic actors as individuals making optimal quantifiable decisions and ignoring any intangible or subjective benefits the individual may experience.  Basically, assuming that something that seems outwardly to be irrational is in fact irrational.  I'm not suggesting that quantitative analysis should aim to reduce its error margins to zero, I'm suggesting it should refrain from choosing its fundamental assumptions based on their friendliness to quantitative analysis rather than on their relevance to the subject under consideration (even if some assumptions lend themselves poorly to data analysis or experimentation).
I do not believe that consumption drives economic growth.  I believe that production drives economic growth as per Say's Law.

That guy won’t be able to buy at his price, and if he chooses to sell at his price, some investor will get a great deal.
Also, as for hoarding, there’s no way an individual or private organization is hoarding more than the world’s governments, and those supplies are taken into account when figuring the world’s gold supply. Sure a big sell-off would cause the price to dip, as prices are determined on the margin, but that also simply represents an opportunity for investors to buy at a discount, which will cause the price to rise back toward the equilibrium price.
I’m not suggesting the value of gold is 100% stable, simply that it’s significantly more stable than paper money.
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:15:06
My assumptions are those of the Austrian School of Economics. It may be out of vogue, but popularity doesn’t equal validity. 
The specific reason that modern assumptions are wrong is that they attempt to define human behavior in ways that are fully quantifiable, which is unreasonable unless you’re willing to explicitly reject free will.
Consider this argument: deflation obviously can’t cause indefinite deferral of basic needs. One can’t put off eating until next year because prices will be lower then, you need to eat today or at least this week. So the only spending that could be deferred is that of discretionary spending. Yet, we see with plenty of discretionary spending that many people will be happy to buy now, rather than wait because they value the subjective experience of owning now.  If this weren’t true, there would be no early adopters of technology.
As for the studies of the Great Depression, we’d have to get into the weeds to discuss that. The mere existence of such studies isn’t sufficient proof as their validity isn’t self evident as with deductive arguments.

You've got that exactly backward.  The CPI is one specific methodology among an infinite number of possible options.  The burden is on those who consider it appropriate to provide a convincing argument why this is the case.  Any defense given must be simple enough to explained to the layperson otherwise there's no reason to believe it, on the grounds that if the researchers cannot explain it simply, they do not understand their own methodology in sufficient depth or in it's proper context.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:09:35
That’s true, and perhaps bitcoin won’t become everyone’s currency, but will remain a niche asset. I wasn’t suggesting that there was any such guarantee, but I do believe that we have not seen the last of gold money. 
Personally, I expect Bitcoin will ultimately force countries back to the gold standard, and will serve as a safe haven asset and an incentive for banks and countries to stay honest as it will preserve the option of individuals to be their own banks if they are not confident in their financial systems.
@_date: 2018-08-12 19:12:31
I'm aware of what inflation means.  I simply don't believe the CPI is accurate.  Furthermore, I recognize that there is substantial incentive to understate the official numbers because it creates an advantage for the government with respect to its creditors.  There is a clear conflict of interest here.  You can't fudge interest rates, as they're explicit contracts, but you can absolutely fudge the results of statistical analysis.  This doesn't even have to be willful or malicious, it can simply be the result of the researchers' biases.

People don’t really have the option to go around banks because all banks are subject to the same laws and regulations.

Because they are benefiting from the use of your money. When you deposit money in a bank, you are in essence lending them money, which they in turn lend out at a higher rate. If the rate is above inflation it’s a win-win for the depositor and the bank (both are profiting), if it’s below inflation, then it’s a win-lose where the bank profits and the depositor’s purchasing power slowly decreases. Even a rate equal to inflation would be acceptable.

The benefits of deregulation have a scholarly basis. That said, the involvement of modern academics has been precisely the problem. It’s what got us into this mess in the first place.
There is a glaring problem with the involvement of academics in government, and it is one of incentives. If an academic convinces government to adopt a policy, and that policy is later determined to have caused inadvertent harm, the academic bears none of the consequences, but the affected citizens have still been damaged and have no remedy. Even if government steps in to provide remedy, the academic is still insulated from taking responsibility for a policy that was of their own design.
This is morally indefensible. No person, regardless of their credentials, has the right to put others in such a situation.  With markets, incentives are built-in. If an entrepreneur pursues a course he believes is best, and is correct, he can expect to be rewarded with profit. If he is incorrect, he can expect to be punished with losses (barring outside intervention).

Bitcoin isn't fiat for the same reason gold isn't fiat.  It's supply is limited, and it's value isn't arbitrarily asserted by a central authority.  The value of both gold and Bitcoin arose from a sufficiently large body of individuals agreeing of their own accord that these things were desireable.  The tricky thing when we talk about this is remembering that all value is ultimately subjective, which makes the discussion of 'real' versus 'artificial' value challenging to have.

The massive bureaucracy is rather new though. The Mercatus Center did a video visualizing regulatory growth since I believe 1949, and the growth rate since then has been much sharper than the growth rate prior.
I can agree that bureaucracy resists rapid changes, it creates a risk of a “death by a thousand cuts” situation where a lot of rules that each do a small and potentially unnoticeable harm (either incidentally or by design) accumulate over time to create a serious problem with no simple solution. 
Personally, that’s what I see when I look at our government right now. It’s reached, or is close to reaching the tipping point in regards to how much accumulated burden it can effectively handle.

Academic theories should not be forced upon citizens by government. If the scientific community is willing to push their ideas on others rather than simply disseminating knowledge, then they deserve to be crucified.
If, on the other hand, people voluntarily choose to adopt the theories produced by academia, and it goes wrong, then there should be no consequences to the academics.
This is not an issue of objective evidence, it’s an issue of ethics. When any Institution claims it is above ethics, it becomes a danger to civilized society and should be opposed. Academia is not exempt from this.  Need I remind you of the many horrors perpetrated in the name of “science” throughout history? 
Science without ethics is an intolerable thing.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:06:38
Don’t equivocate. Science can mean one of two things: (1) the scientific method or (2) the scientific community. I have no problem with (1), but a big problem with (2). It is common for sitting academics to advocate for their theories to become ensconced in law.  It is that practice that I have a problem with.
Societies should be run based on ethics, and by that I mean the branch of philosophy with thousands of years of scholarly work to its credit.  
I respect honest scholarship, but I do not respect career academics who essentially insist that their theories are the only possible correct ones. Scientific results (distinct from science itself), often turn out to be wrong. As such, there needs to be room for healthy skepticism, something that few sitting academics sincerely recognize.
The act of advocating for a theory to become law is de facto rejection of skepticism and therefore a betrayal of science as a discipline.

Oversight could be accomplished by simply requiring the military to maintain good records and periodically submit to audit. Congress doesn’t need to be involved in every major purchase decision, they can just allocate the overall defense budget, conduct audits and be done with it.
The trouble with complex administration is that after a point the voting public doesn’t understand what’s actually going on, that’s what I meant earlier by saying that bureaucracy can obfuscate crony deals. At that point, what insurance is really left to protect the public from special interest influence?
