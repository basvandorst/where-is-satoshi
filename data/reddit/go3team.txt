No mining is done on the machine.  Yes, I am part of a pool.
@_date: 2014-01-21 07:25:56
Nope.  Access was gained via SSH from a trusted machine on the network.  Still analyzing how that was done.
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:36:21
Import using the false switch.  Then once all of the keys are imported, stop bitcoind and restart with the -rescan switch.  That should import 1 key in less than a second.

No.  I work nights, and sleep during the day.  The attack happened between Noon and around 2 PM local time.  I was asleep at the time.  My wife was at work.  The dogs would have had a problem with anyone else being here.  I've traced the hack to a Leaseweb server in The Netherlands, which was most likely a proxy.  I've emailed the relevant log files to their abuse department, but really expect nothing from them.

That's what it shows for me as well, and .002 something for a Quadcopter.  Sounds like a steal.

Check out my reply from earlier.  I was able to import 100,000 keys using this method in about 5-6 hours.  
    bitcoind importprivkey $priv account false
Once the keys have been imported
    bitcoind -daemon -rescan

Here's what I have so far - SSH is enabled on the wallet machine.  The wallet machine was SSH'd into from another machine on the network.  This machine only has port 80 forwarded to it, and is an Apache webserver.  I could only find 1 file in the /var/www directory that had been changed recently - it was a Word Press file "wp-redirect.php".  From looking at the file, I'm really not sure what is going on with it.
I cannot find the exact commands, but from what I could tell they were searching for wallet files on the target machine.  
That's where I'm at so far.
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:16:37
I could, I've disabled apache for the time being until things get cleaned up.
@_date: 2014-01-21 07:24:24
That's how it's set.
@_date: 2014-01-21 08:14:03
The wallet was not running on the webserver.  The webserver was a trusted user on the network.

Expedia is the worst.  I used them once and had to pay for the room up front.  I got to where I was going, and they had no knowledge that I had already paid.  They wanted the cost of the room again which was like $1500 for the entire stay.  Trying to deal with this overseas was a real pain.  They f'd me pretty hard.

That only works for Uber Taxi.  If you think that 20% goes to your normal Uber driver it doesn't.

Sounds like a permissions issue.  Might have to adjust the permissions of the wallet.dat file and go from there to test.

You can run top or if installed htop.  It will show you in order what process is using the most CPU power.  CPU mining these days is pissing in the wind, so it may not be worth the effort or loss of job to this person, although who knows.

There used to be a 7-11 on the corner of Bells and Jeff Davis back when I worked in the area.  They were getting robbed as a co worker and I were walking in.  Which is why I asked the original question.  Good times.

Too bad you're on the other side of the country.  I'd send a few coins your way for it.  That's a nice ride.

It could be done.  What is it worth to you - in BTC to have this done?
