Kind of confusing really... why do it that way?
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:07:58


Miners can just sweep it up as soon as the mempools are empty, at no cost to anyone.  If I remember what I read on git or somewhere they're publishing the private key or something

What's the precise protocol?
Seems like including a tiny payment to a specific address would be really easy for nearly all wallets?  Am I missing something?

Is it true that the lightning network will take 1.5 years to be ready though?
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:53:34
It doesn't seem to bloat the utxo set.  At least the way they talked about it it was supposed to be anyone-can spend.  Did they take that part out?
Edit: Nevermind, I think they said they were going to publish the private key for that to ensure the dust could be swept up.

I mean, from what I understand, for it to really be usable, they have to code something to provide routes over the network topology, but no one has it working yet?  I don't know much about that.  But then even after they get that done, lightning still needs adoption because you can't send to a lightning destination with a bitcoin wallet or vice versa unless both people are already on lightning... I dunno how much time that might take. :(
Yes, I would call Bitcoin ready, at least when the mempool is close to empty, or at least ready for the next stage of growth

It is hard coded as their anti-reorg protection or some shit
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:52:52
Pretty sure they are, or were supposed to be.  Maybe someone can confirm
Edit: Nvm, they said they will publish the private key for that address so the dust can be swept up
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:04:53


If they follow through and publish the private key though, can't we just clean it up?
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:51:21


The outputs are supposed to be (?required to be?) anyone can spend, at least how they talked about it at certain points.  Can't tell if that part actually made it in or not, maybe the sigscript requirements
Edit: Nvm, not required; It sounds like they're publishing the private key instead so the dust can be swept up
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:13:21
Miners can as soon as mempools are empty, to clean up utxo bloat.
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:57:37
You're talking about the return thing?
I don't think I can use that through the wallets I use... This one I know I can use though, easy.  I don't see what's bad about it?  Easier to split from shitcoins, easier to sell shitcoins, so no problem... what am I missing?

\&gt; 1mb block is required at fork height, can't happen
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:49:50
The way they talked about it, the outputs were supposed to be anyone can spend.  So it wouldn't bloat the uxto.  I can't tell for sure if that's what the sigscript requirement adds or not
Edit: Nvm, not the sigscript, they were going to publish the private key for it so the dust could be swept up.  So won't stay in the utxo set
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:23:02


They said they were going to publish the private key of the address.  In that case the miners can simply sweep up the dust at no cost as soon as the mempools are empty
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:49:04


Pretty sure that the outputs are required to be anyone-can-spend so that they can be cleaned up, at least that was what they were talking about.  So it doesn't bloat the utxo
Edit: nvm, they said they were going to publish the private key for that address or something

From what I hear you basically just described Seattle/Portland, both before and after legalization... :P
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:07:16
What are you referring to that they should have done?
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:29:21


Maybe?  I'm pretty sure the wallets I've tried don't support that though :/  Maybe I'm just on older versions or they have some special setting?  This way I can just include an output and then split and sell my shitcoins
