Upvoting this because 99% of Reddit has absolutely no idea how a business doing a million dollars/year operates, let alone one that is doing that level of business hourly/daily.
It’s easy to say “it’s just development” except it’s not. When you can’t even keep your website online, how in the world does anyone expect them to also be developing major upgrades to their platform?  It’s not as simple as hiring, they don’t have a strong functioning team if I was to guess as the entire team is likely doubling in size month over month, just as the price of Bitcoin is.
I get it, trust me I get it, but this simply isn’t how things work in a company at this growth speed in such a completely unregulated yet fully regulated industry such as this.  Coinbase is no doubt doing all they can, but there is literal limits to how quickly a company can grow, and contrary to popular belief, Coinbase is likely struggling to stay afloat due to all of this.
So, compared to most, huge props to Coinbase for doing what they can, and actually communicating out proactively that they have hit their breaking point.

Should release after 2-3 weeks. Waiting is fun, helps you think about life choices and such. Ya know?

Respectfully, that isn’t how the real world works in business. While it sounds like a simple and easy solution, it’s not when you are in a situation like they are.  While you may think they are getting rich (and they may), I would guess they are instead burning through cash like no tomorrow.

Dude... Some questions you just don't ask
