The more that I hear Wright defend himself, the more I'm convinced he's not Satoshi. Anyone who's been even casually acquainted with the Bitcoin world knows the huge mystery that surrounds Satoshi's identity. Such a person _has_ to know that coming forward and claiming to be Satoshi is going to spark an absolute shit storm of 'prove it' responses. To come forward and not have _any_ irrefutable proof of your claimed identity - especially something as simple as proving ownership - is an absolutely stupid move. Either Wright is just lying (which I believe is the most likely scenario) or he's actually Satoshi trying to discredit himself so he doesn't have to look over his shoulder the rest of his life. He's either a complete idiot or brilliant. I'm voting for the former.

I understand what you want here. But they are in the middle of recovering from and investigating a major hack that cost their company and their customers money. Things likely aren't coherent and concise _within_ the organization right now as they're probably learning new information as things progress. That information is naturally going to evolve as they get deeper into finding out what happened and deciding on the best way to fix it.
Personally, I _prefer_ the method of 'thinking out loud' that they're doing here. Sure, that means we might get a bit of disjointed information but I'd certainly rather that process than a single post or two then silence. Either way, though, they really can't win this from a PR standpoint.

No, you absolutely _do not_ need a bunch of coins sitting in a web wallet to develop market value. What you need are people to use exchanges to convert between fiat and cryptocurrency. But. let's be honest, the _majority_ of people don't do that. They keep Bitcoin on the exchange and they use it as their wallet. If you believe that's how it 'has to be' order for Bitcoin to have value then you aren't understanding one of the key points of Bitcoin. 
I have no problem with people using exchanges. Using exchanges as their primary wallet is just asking for trouble.

I honestly have a bit of sympathy for both Bitfinex and The community places them in an impossible situation: if they are quiet until they have a plan, the community starts screaming fraud and coming up with wild conspiracy theories as to why they are so quiet. If they say something that later changes then the community accuses them of lying. It's an impossible situation either way and I certainly don't envy the place in which they find themselves.
We have to remember that Bitfinex is _trying_ to keep us as much in the know as possible. But they are also dealing with the aftermath of what amounts to a massive hack of their system, working with law enforcement, and trying to actually return the system to a usable state. We users need to chill out and give them space to work through the process without freaking out on them.
Just. Chill. Out.

While I certainly sympathize with people here who might have lost money, I have to wonder why anyone who's holding enough Bitcoin at BF for this hack to be 'life changing' and ruin them would be comfortable placing that much money in an online wallet? How many times do people need to lose major amounts of money before we accept the truth that web wallets cannot be verified as secure and the only way to secure your bitcoin is to keep them on your own machine or (preferably) a hardware wallet.  
We're warned about this _all the time_. When will people start taking that warning seriously?

At this point, I can't imagine any of surviving in the future without being WUA. I mean, it's very little extra work to create a universal app and the payoff is huge. I suspect that copay is going to be the first to go there.

I'm not saying he _should_ sue for a couple of cents. My point is that if he didn't actually do anything wrong he should not have to pay _anything_ to get his money. The _amount_ isn't really important. It's a principle. At least it would be for me; it might not be for him.
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:47:49
I hate to say it, but it's time for some regulation here. This keeps happening again and again and it's seriously shaking peoples faith in Bitcoin. It's very hard to convince someone that Bitcoin is the answer when the comeback can easily be "yeah, but my bank won't disappear with my money one day". 
Or maybe we don't need the suffocating arm of the government. Maybe what we need is a requirement for deposit insurance. Not from the government but private insurers. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:56:34
I understand that. My point though is that it will cost him more money to transfer it to somewhere else then cash out. Why should he have to pay for that when Coinbase could do it easily and probably cheaper.
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:55:43
I strongly doubt that too. Likely, it's just taking time to work through the process. Plus, like you said, it's Saturday.
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:35:29
Yes, you can _transfer_ your Bitcoin anywhere for a very tiny fee. But he probably wants to cash them out which will incur _another_ fee from whatever exchange does the conversion. That's two fees instead of a single fee from Coinbase. Now, I realize that the fee is _very_ small, but it's still there. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:04:32
I'd give them a few days and contact an attorney in the meantime. Or maybe even give a call to the FTC on Monday. I'm not sure that 'violating our terms and conditions' can be used as grounds for 'so we're taking all your money and keeping it'.

Yeah, he pretty much came to that conclusion. He was thinking about doing a solar farm to power the servers and that still didn't look sustainable long-term. What about the question about how future mining will work? Any insights?
@_date: 2016-06-04 04:14:42
That's a good idea. In fact, I'd totally use that service. Like I stop by a hot dog truck to grab a hot dog and pay with bitcoin but then I remember I meant to buy some bitcoin earlier, I could just do it right there and the merchant could get money from the sale. It could even happen completely passively. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:38:20
Ah, that's what I was missing: tx fees continue. So there is still money to be made, just not the same kind of rewards we have now. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-11 07:27:13
You just have the perfect answer. Thank you for being honest. I too would like something irrefutable. At this point, I don't know what is. I suppose that's the whole point though, isn't it? 
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:09:06
Good point. On further thought, I suppose my real question has more to do with the 'end' of mining that what I asked about. As mining becomes harder and harder, we'll see what we have now: a thinning herd of large miners who can invest the money into their operations because there is still room for some profit. But what happens when that incentive is gone? For example, difficulty becomes simply so hard that even large operations are spending more than they're making. Or, when the last Bitcoin is mined and there are no more rewards for a miners work? What will keep miners in the game at that point?
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:34:21
I couldn't put any of that better myself. Becoming a better person is what it's all about. That's what really changes the world  in the end.

Physical presence already isn't enough for many. If you believe in this massive, multinational, conspiracy involving hundreds of people all with different agendas then it's not too far fetched to believe a physical observer or lab couldn't easily be added to the mix. We are at the point where those who aren't convinced never will be regardless of what proof is presented to them. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:00:58
I'm curious as to what proof-of-life was so easy to get before the raid? Signed PGP messages? Show me one.  Live, interactive, video? We have that. People don't believe it's real. Appearances at the embassy window?  New security precautions in place after the DNC leaks could explain that change. Oh, and, of course, people would immediately say it was a body double.
So, _what_ proof of life are you referring to? Also, understand that I am not challenging you just to be a dick. I'm in this for truth and accuracy. If we're saying something 'used to be' a certain way but isn't now then we're injecting some doubt about current situations. We need to be able to back that up.
@_date: 2017-01-11 07:04:19
So what would you accept as actual, irrefutable, proof of life. What would make you say "two, that's him"? Please don't say PGP. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:31:42


But that's the very problem at this point in this: there literally _is no way_ for him to do an acceptable proof of life anymore. Think about what he has already done and the ongoing "it can be faked" narrative:
- He's done a few recorded TV interviews. 
- He's done a few recorded audio interviews
- He's now done a live, interactive, video AMA
Honestly, there is _nothing_ that he could do that could be more convincing than those things. That's the problem with always wanting to dig deeper into conspiracy. At some point, you realize that _there is no bottom_ and you just keep going deeper and deeper even when you already have the truth (which I personally believe we do).
Let's look at what else he could do for a second:
- A DNA test to prove it's him. Well, if one believes in the breadth and depth of the supposed conspiracy so far then it's really not too hard to just throw a few more people in and say that the person taking the sample and the lab were in on a fake or bought off, had their families threatened, etc. 
- An appearance at the embassy window. Body double, actor, hell, I've seen people hypothise that it could even be a hologram
- PGP signed message. Carries absolutely no proof at all. I find it funny that what amounts to the _least_ verifiable proof-of-life is the one people are demanding the most. 
So, short of visiting every one of us and allowing us to do our own independant DNA test, there is absolutely _no way_ for Assange to move forward with proof-of-life at this point. I think it's time he simply moves on and ignore the doubters. Time will ultimately tell if he is real or not and if Wikileaks is compromised. The leaks themselves will be all the evidence we need.


What raid? Is there any actual proof that a raid actually took place? That's an assumption based on what? Someone's word with very little or no evidence. Assange gives us a ton of circumstantial evidence that he is alive and we won't believe it but 'some dude on the Internet' said there was a raid and we swallow it with no problem. Can we say confirmation bias?
Don't get me wrong, something _is fishy_ with Wikileaks. But none of us know the depth of the intimidation or pressure they are under right now. These guys are publishing under _enormous_ stress and danger to themselves. Is it any shock that they would act a little weird now and then? It's one thing to _expect_ pressure on you when you're publishing, it's a whole different thing to be living under it constantly.
I'm not saying don't be skeptical but I'm saying _you have to have a personal limit_. If you're really looking for truth you have to accept that all of the cool spy stuff (raids, renditions, Assange escaping to another country, being compromised, etc) might actually not be true. Shit might just be weird because they are under enormous pressure. It's interesting and cool to hold to the 'he's potentially compromised' line because, well, I think some people (not you) just like to keep the drama going. But at what point do we admit that it's just getting kind of silly and we are at a point where there simply _is no way to prove_ what we want proven?


I actually don't want certain answer. I want people to think in an unbiased way for a change. Sure. Assange might be compromised, he might be rendered, he might be a hologram, yadda, yadda, yadda, but he might also just be a guy in a deep shit situation stuck in a tiny room with a cat. 
Think about this: Wikileaks can survive without Assange. Why not just kill him in the supposed raid and say he suicided? He threatened to do that if he was under threat of eminent arrest. Then, Wikileaks could be all like "They killed Assange! Those bastards! We'll keep publishing to show them we won't be intimidated!" To me, that would make MUCH more sense than the supposed 4 month charade of pretending he's alive and safe when he's not.
Like I'm not looking for certain answers. If Assange is dead, he's dead. Nothing I or anyone can do about it. If he's not, he's not. Right now, it's _much_ more interesting to focus on proving out Wikileaks credibility than it is Assange's safety to me. Assange is just a figurehead. Wikileaks is what really matters. I just want people to think. Unbiased. Clearly. Without confirmation bias. 
I hope that conversations like you and I are having right now will help accomplish that goal.

True, no amount of encryption will stop a warrant but it _will_ stop an investigation. If the seized data is useless to the investigators because it's encrypted, you win lol

Good points. Brain Wallets have always fascinated me. I love the idea that the transaction might be kept secret for years or even decades until the person decides to receive their Bitcoins. There are so many great uses for this. Hell, I could even think of giving an inheritance using a brain wallet.

This is an excellent point,  Really, it's a point saying that Bitcoin creates value _without_ burdening the next (several generations) with an enormous debt that they have no hope of paying back. It's creating value without hurting your kids, your grandkids, or your country.  Thank you!
@_date: 2012-09-05 23:37:09
Yes. It's basically like a 'cash register for Bitcoins'. It's got all the features of a modern cash register except it operates entirely on Bitcoin.

You're definitely right about the industry being more focused on the money to be made than fixing the issues. But that's where users can be of the most help. If you _refuse_ to do business with providers who don't implement a set of well accepted security standards, they have two choices: 1) fix the problems or 2) go out of business. The market can force the providers to adopt standards.
Like I said, the standards are there. They just need to be applied to Bitcoin. It's up to the community to make sure that happens by using pressure.
@_date: 2012-09-09 00:41:56
Yeah, there's always the legal aspect of it. But if you consider the time you may spend in prison if the data were decrypted against the time you may spend locked up for contempt of court, it might be a good call to just refuse to decrypt it and protect your customers. You'd definitely be a good test case (at least here in the US) for data security.
Off-site backups are a good idea too. 
Wasn't there a movie about something like this not too long ago?
@_date: 2012-09-08 23:06:15
You know what, never mind, I get you. You said _transactions_ have nothing to do with an IRC network. I see what you mean now.

People are looking at the problem wrong IMHO. When a bank gets robbed, do we see "will people still trust the US dollar" (or whatever is the regional currency) because of it? Of course not. People realize that the problem has to do with _the bank_ and not _the currency_. The same is true for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is safe. Bitcoin hasn't been hacked. Exchanges and services around Bitcoin have been hacked and you deal with that the _exact_ same way you deal with banks being robbed.
Increased security. Standards.
What we need is for a group of trusted individuals to come up with some security standards for anyone accepting and storing Bitcoins. These could probably be similar to the security standards adopted by banks. Then, and this is the tough part, the community needs to _refuse to do business with anyone not following those standards_.  It really is that simple. 
We also need public education. Every time you read a 'Bitcoin Hacked!' article that discusses an exchange compromise, call them on it. Publicly. People don't understand Bitcoin and don't know that "an exchange" isn't the same as "Bitcoin". It's our job to educate them.

@_date: 2012-09-09 00:14:21
Yes it would. I would think you'd fall under postal regulations kind of like Mailboxes Etc does. But if you did things right, you might be able to do it. You would just have to make sure ALL of your customer data is encrypted because you could be raided at any time.
@_date: 2012-09-08 23:49:55
True. That's still the huge problem as I see it: anonymity with merchants who ship to the real world. As long as it's digital it's fairly easy to keep it anonymous. Buying real world products gets sticky. That is probably a business opportunity.
@_date: 2012-09-21 01:21:43
If you've already got an encrypted container using TrueCrypt that's a good option. Otherwise, if you're just going to use it to store your wallet, why not just use GPG's symetric encryption.
It's as simple as
_gpg -c wallet.dat_
and putting in a password. Decryption is just as simple:
_gpg --decrypt wallet.dat_
From there, just upload the file anywhere.
@_date: 2012-09-08 23:20:40
So then this brings up another logical question (maybe): If the Bitcoins were were sent to a brand new address never used on the blockchain before and they were never transferred to another address (except to merchant addresses) and never converted to fiat, then you have near perfect anonymity?

You're right: mining isn't a get rich quick scheme. But nothing in the Bitcoin ecosystem really is. Mining Bitcoin, to me, is a long term strategy. I am willing to lose immediate money because I believe Bitcoin will eventually go up in value to the point where I will recoup my investment in the long term. I think that is the only logical reason for mining. Otherwise, it's just simpler and cheaper to buy on the open market.

I've used Coinbase for a few years now and have nothing bad to say about them at all. I'd say use them. Their fees might be a _little_ higher than some others but it's worth it for the security and reliability you get.

I think it depends on _who_ Satoshi is. If he's a group of people then we might never see the coins used or not used for a very long time. If he's a "fairly young" man or woman then we may see him/her hold on to the coins until retirement age. If he's an old man or woman, we might see them become part of some sort of inheritance. What a great legacy that would be to pass down to children or grandchildren!
I honestly don't agree with those that say he will never use them. If that were the case, why hold on to them at all? Why not just give them to someone like Hal Finney or Gavin in the very beginning? I think the fact that Satoshi held on to the coins says he/she/they plan on spending them _at some point_ but it might be a good long time before they do.
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:34:03
But this isn't true.  Until we find a way for the average person to convert fiat to Bitcoin without all the AML/KYC stuff we run into almost universally,  we really can't 'ignore the government'  like Max pretends.

I understand his _contribution_ but I still don't see him as an innovator. A revolutionary, maybe, but not an innovator.  I to take issue with your statement about him "creating a model of industry". He didn't. He put up an ecommerce website. The only real difference is that he attached it to a .onion address instead of a regular domain name. So innovation is the ability to hide something? In that case, every street dealer, prostitute, or inside trader who doesn't get caught is an innovator.
Sorry, I think Ulbricht didn't deserve what he got and the drug war is silly. But he's not an innovator. But hey, think what you want.
