This article recommends leaving a note somewhere where it's easy to find and giving family heads up to make sure to not throw it. Or giving it to an accountant. Many people can not trust their family with money. There are many ugly divorces. There are many dishonest accountants. I still think the laws about inheritance in combination with banks provide way safer option - you leave a post-mortem with no possibility that a person with access to the note can take your money when you're alive. Still I see that you either you risk that a person you share your note can easily steal your money or you risk that the money will be lost forever and your family will be left without financial security. I don't see any third option where both security of your finances and ensurance that the money will end up with your family after you're dead.

exactly. but with bitcoin people tend to push it in conversations more than other areas of life (just look at how many upvote this post has). I used to talk a lot about bitcoin to friends but one day I had a moment of self-reflection, looked back and it and cringed really hard because of how I would try to bring it up in every conversation. Don't be like me, it makes bitcoin look like a sect. Still cringing when I think about some of the situations

they don't care about what is bitcoin, they hate being preached about it. Sort of like me and MLM or Jehova's witness. I don't care about your weird religion but if you keep preaching me I will dislike you.

In europe you can pay contactless so you are able to just put your card close to terminal and the payment takes few seconds (if it's under certain amount it doesn't require PIN). I thought it was everywhere but when I came to US 2 years ago, there were only those old machines that you had to insert your card in and put pin. Also the price for terminal seems like bullshit. It is usually counted by ~1% percentage and few cents per transactions.
