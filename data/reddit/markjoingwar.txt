Do you have *actual proof* of that? As far as I can tell those tactics are assocaited with boths sides very much.

Uh, then that system is not Bitcoin. In Bitcoin the miner's hashpower *is* the deciding factor. Anything else is an alt-coin.

A bit of a shoerthoughts or post but I am pretty sure that if Gox happened as a result of an actual hack on Bitcoin and over a few short hours that it would have been 'rolled back' without much questioning at the time, considering how much of the market it had 'control' over at the time.

From a technological point of view I don't see any reason why anything proposed in this document:
[cannot be achieved]( 
From all the research I have done I think Bitcoin can do everything and give up nothing. If anyone has any reliable hard evidence (not just an opinion) to the contrary then please show it.

All of them you say? What if I told you I had seen some of the comments before they were removed and that your previous statement is a lie?

Bitcoin was created by Satoshi who clearly stated and spelled out that the data cap is not somehting the network should ever be pressed against. We may rise and hit the cap but then the cap should rise over that; per the design.
Anything else is an alternative version of Bitcoin and not the vision I and many others signed up for years ago. One where no small group of people that think they know better than everyone else can control things. Anyone know of such a system these days?

um what? The scaling problem has been an issue that I've been hearing about since 2012 at least. If you don't understand it that is fine but don't belittle others for bothering to do their own research and come to their own conclusions based on the facts and not comments in an echo chamber

The deal is he had a computer set to encrypt everything but also decrypt everything; the idea being though that only when he logged in would it be decrypted.
The FBI wanted his SR info while it was decrypted so they couldbn't let him shut his computer when they grabbed him after they figured out who he was (illegally?) 
They staged a boy and a girl getting into a relationship fight, while these agents were screaming at eachother Ross looked up and other agents tackled him to keep him from shutting him computer.

No, the BTC rate doesn't change but it the exchange rate goes up that btc rate becomes more expensive on its own.
Last time we went to 1000$usd the fees got lowered to where they are today

Just like it isn't hard to believe that vested interests in stopping bitcoin would spend millions of dollars blackmailing and corrupting developers, paying for comments to be posted praising what they like and alienating those that disagree, creating bots to post similar content around the clock.
Either way, I don't think that is what OP is talking about here.
@_date: 2016-05-07 19:34:57
Yeah a bunch of trolls or hired comments have been making that false claim, and I note offering no alternative explanation.
But the CIA wouldn't be dumb enough to have Gavin be working for them and ask him to come give a presentation (one that he told us about, he could have gone and no one would have known).
Anyone who joined the bitcoin development after that meeting is a potential sleeper agent for the CIA, especially ones who fit the bill for what CIA/NSA likes in their computer workers, no drugs, strong fundamentals (religion, family life)

Bitcoin is about not letting other people have control over things they shouldn't.
OP don't listen to this guy he is always pushing this/a agenda; There is nothing wrong with paper wallets when you use them correctly. 
There is nothing more proper or less about a mnemonic, it is all preference.

This is the right place to start but it can't be the only piece.
For one we don't know the veracity of the logs, they could have been tampered with. However we do know Karpeles and Jed knew about and used a mt-gox bot which may have been an earlier form of willy or the other bot.
PR Storm, on the back or recent price rise, SR Shutdown and public knowledge of btc, manipulation of demand coupled with lack of access (can't get fiat out of Gox at first) are all parts.
I;ve heard convincing arguments that china had something ot do with it to.
IMO perfect storm (for everyone except mark)
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:03:44
Fees, either a lot of them (digital cash), or few of them that are very big. The exchange rate going up would bolster the value of either.

OP i have you on RES with 24 downvotes overall.
Why would that be? I figure because you say things that are incorrect and false. Now you can't even explain a very simple part of bitcoin and I have no doubt all the previosu comments I've downvotes of your have been similarly uneducated.
OP perhaps you should be less vocal on matters you clearly don't understand.
@_date: 2016-05-26 13:50:19
They want a permissioned chain because as they have stated years ago they would have already been using btc but it can't handle anywhere near the amount of txs they want. should note this is virtually the only instance of someone wanting bigger blocks than are good for the system, everything else promised for raising that data cap would be technologically easy with little damage to decentralization, tests and studies show.
As others mentioned they don't like they can't change the monetary policy, add new coins, etc. They also don't like they can't take back coins or refund them; so expect these two options in sachksofcoins

I hate to say this OP but that only proves the point I think you think you were trying to show didn't exist.
There may not be a crisis yet but anyone with half a brain can see what is coming, your calavier arttitude and distain for science on the matter (citing your anecdopte as a fact of the matter) and part of the continuing problem of ignorance we have with users.
If there was suddenly higher demand, fees might go up  (and people might find a new method of payment) but everytime you riase a fee someone else gets pushed out.
It sounds like you are advocating for a system that only the rich can use, not for the common man.
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:00:36
It is something of a debate, most people tend to use it both ways. You have 10 bitcoins, or you have 10 bitcoin or a lot of bitcoin.
However I've only ever seen one person call many Satoshis many satoshi.
Personally I like 1 bitcoin, 10 bitcoin, many bitoin. 1 satoshi, 10 satoshis, many satoshis.
Helpful maybe but not new I would say, I've met people who have been living on Bitcoin alone since 2013 or 2014, the round about and complicated ways to get things are much less complicated these days but still as roundabout.

Either I don't understand your question or you still do't understand the nature of the network.
Nodes connect to a small number of other nodes, a valid tx is broadcast to every node each node knows and it ripples out from there.     
If any node recieves a invalid tx, such as spending 23million btc, or coins with the wrong secret key, or coins from an address with no satoshis in it; the result of this is that one specific node does not transmit that tx to any other nodes.
In these cases only the connected nodes will ever see anything, that is usually at least 8 nodes, but it could be any node AFAIK there is no place that keeps track of these things for every individual collectively.
Invalid txs don't go out part their failed attempt at start, other than running a node and accepting many many connections and taking an average could you hope to gain any insight 
@_date: 2016-05-28 18:55:53
Where are you getting that figure?
@_date: 2016-05-28 04:19:52
There is no way of knowing, if the tx is invalid no nodes will relay it.

Envy? JEalously is fear of losing something you slready have
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:03:04
I think you have a misunderstanding in what you are saying. An invalid tx is not the same as an unconfirmed tx.
invalid means it doens't satisfy the rules, wrong password, not enoguh btc, etc. these txs are broadcast but never relayed.
unconfirmed is different
