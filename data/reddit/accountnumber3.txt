Because it's not a "number", it's a value. Bitcoin rules state that the nonce value has to have 32 bits/characters. Leading zeroes are not dropped.

Hi from What's going on here?

I've got like $1.45USD worth of bitcoin.

I'm new to Bitcoin (as in I haven't started yet) and I'm wondering about the legality of it. I'm sure that bitcoin in and of itself isn't illegal and I'm sure that it won't easily be banned for doing illegal things with it, but I want to stay within the law for tax purposes.
I see from the responses to this thread that there is no doubt if I exchange (convert?) from BTC to USD, I'll need to report it as income, but how? What's the process/what do I report it as/what are the key words I need to know to look up the rest of what I need to know?
I'm really excited to get into Bitcoining. I just want to do it right.

Thanks for the reply.
I'm looking specifically at mining though, so everything would be a gain. A little research shows I'd need to register as an MSB, but the only documentation I can find is about as dry as legal documentation can get. 
Side question 1: does the bitcoin community frown upon someone mining coins for the sole purpose of exchanging to USD/etc? Let's say that through whatever convenient mechanism you choose (time, super-asics, FSM), all the coins have been found and mining is no longer possible. The value is still there and the adoption of bitcoins as an accepted currency isn't going to decrease just because they've all been found, right?
Side question 2: I'm looking at getting an ASIC, but if they've only just started shipping and are 2-6 months behind, that means there are 2-6 months worth of people that have ordered these things and will have theirs before I have mine. What effect will ASICs have on the difficulty/block reward? If everyone's got an ASIC, pretty soon the only way to make any money off of mining is by having a room full of them.
