The most secure and convenient I know of. If you want a bit more of an elegant solution though, check out KeepKey. Based on the same firmware, just prettier and more expensive.

They keep 2 of 3 keys. Nty.

Was just about to post the same thing. I dig it.

It has said clearly when personal messaging for quite awhile that they may not be kept private. I don't see what the uproar is. I do agree Bitcointalk Forums isn't optimal though.

Life PRO tip - Get new boss if they won't tolerate disagreement.

I don't use them, nor do I plan to.

You're not allowed to spend your money how you want.

Never used it but this has been around for quite awhile.

Bitcoin is already accessible to anyone in a free market with an internet connection. Perhaps regulation would add to the perception of validity for some people, but ultimately I foresee it only making it more difficult to use.

Been sitting on an encrypted wallet with 5 BTC for years if it makes you feel any better.

More capitalism please.

Wallet.dat straight from the full Bitcoin client. Password was less than 16 characters I believe. Ran a word list based off of what I thought it was right after it happened but didn't have any luck. Haven't tried since. Recommendations?

Or people grow up and become more security conscious. No offense to those who've lost money, I have myself. However the sooner people realize how important their privacy is, the better. I think it's possible for the average neophyte to understand where basic security holes are and be responsible for themselves. I think banks and Bitcoin can live in unity though.

Some votes via phone actually do cost.

Terribly interesting but not Bitcoin related.

Bitcoin has not conformed to anything, institutions are beginning to conform to it.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:32:33
When things become more mainstream the price won't be so volatile and this won't be an issue. Just like you think in terms of USD now, it'll be Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency.

Do you know something I don't?

There's a much higher probability that someone guesses all the information needed to use your credit card.
