The miners fee are usually included with the transactions i send from my wallet. I have it set to automatically include a fee im not sure why it didnt include in these transactions.The one transaction i posted went through today, the other transaction still hasnt been posted at all so i cant send blockchain info about it. Strangely enough today after loading my wallet on my computer there was additional btc in my wallet. So I sent the entire balance of my wallet to a market wallet and included very high miners fee and now it says "offline" 0 confirmations" for that transaction. plus my wallet lists other transactions as uncofirmed but they went through already. Any suggestions? My thoughts are to move my btc from the wallet on my computer to a market wallet and than redownload electrum wallet instead of bitcoin qt, I am on windows if that matters. waiting two days now 5.9 coins in limbo

I've closed my wallet and opened it repeatedly, let it stay closed for 12 hours and then sync, nothing. Kept my wallet closed last night and resynced today still no change.

i had 3.01 or so in my wallet and the next morning there was additional 2.9 without transaction record. so i sent the 5.9 out with high miners fee
