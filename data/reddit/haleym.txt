That's fine, just recognize that there is a difference between what you value it for (i.e., how it suits your personal ideology) and the feasibility of its widespread adoption.

Bad analogy; acting as a currency is its most basic function, and it does that really poorly. 4K video streaming is not the internet’s basic function.
It might be something more worthwhile one day and it might not. Right now the vast majority of demand is from people hoping to get rich, not from people who actually want to use it as a means of exchange. People who were demanding internet in the 90’s actually valued it for its functionality.

It’s almost as if BTC isn’t very useful as a currency

I’m talking about functionality from the user perspective, not architecture. If it’s not very usable as a currency then most people won’t use it.


I mean decentralized to the extent that it will achieve the libertarian dream of a currency that can operate as a modern economy’s primary medium of exchange without government backing of any sort. That’s simply not going to happen.

I’m not writing it off. There will probably be some sort of electronic currency in common use eventually and it will certainly bring some major changes. There’s just a lot of talk surrounding the types of changes it will bring that’s more about ideological and political motivations than anything inherent to blockchain-type tech. There’s nothing saying you can’t have a gov’t-backed inflationary cryptocurrency, etc.

Well, the US and other gov’ts are [already planning their own cryptos]( so they’re going to be in the mix whether you ideologically agree with their status as cryptos or not.

You can’t be a decentralized currency without first being a currency. Its currency function is more basic than the decentralization, if people don’t want to use it as a currency then the rest of it is just fluff.
Besides, if you really think there’s ever going to be a truly decentralized, unregulated currency you’re kidding yourself.

I’m not talking about niche cases. Its popularity right now is almost entirely related to speculation that it might stabilize and replace existing currencies someday in the far future. As things stand it’s too volatile and costly to be used as proper currency in the vast majority of cases.

Yes, thoroughly debunked. There's absolutely no way the same person could have written both of those emails.

Smart people get predictions about major technological advances wrong all the time.
