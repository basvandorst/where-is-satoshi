The address starts with a 3. That's segwit, therefore bip49.

No, if you find the right seed still you are gonna get a big list using that site.
In fact you can derive infinite amount of addresses from a given seed.    
But what's more likely (hopefully) is that the prize address is among the first ones. Or at least some clues that leads to the right derivation path.
If you wanna learn more, read this chapter:
And yeah. Search through the comments. There are a couple of scripts that can automate that for you.

But one thing to note, OP said all hints are still valid. If it were a private key rather than a seed then changing the address would change the corresponding private key. 
But if it is the seed, then you can derive another address from the same seed. Not the same thing with private key... 
The address change thing points more towards a seed but yet EC could be the way.

Or 12 **pairs**. "Think in pairs"
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:28:21
Yeah thought the same thing. Read chapter 5 of Mastering Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:27:24
Well now its -1 
OP said when you got the answer, there will be no doubt. You might be getting sth wrong...
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:00:04
"Key word a bit" what??
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:53:42
No you can derive as many as adresses you want  
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:46:39
Search thorugh the comments. A day ago or so someone had a similar theory based on elliptic curve point addition...      
Maybe something with the [Secp256k1]( curve.
It could be vey well the right path. Who knows!

I wish there were any clues to those "consolation prizes"...
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:04:55
Youre moving the fund. Are you saying its gonna have the same private key? Just another derived address? 
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:40:41
Yeah since most of them are not in bip39
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:44:17
OP (u/cryptogreetings) should change his top comment mentioning the moving of the funds. 
Too much confusion already 
 
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:44:49
Yeah exactly. Great marketing technique!    
People have indexed the shit out of the thread here.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:38:55
You're right. That could be the case.
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:50:49
By the way, if that helped send me all your crypto savings ;)
Edit: yo that was sarcasm downvoter

one thing I noticed is that many people still believe fiat money is backed by gold. now when you tell them bitcoin is not backed by gold or something, they're like whaaat??
