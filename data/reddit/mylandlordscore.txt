the rating part is more regarding the landlord and management group, but we could definitely add something about comfort of apartment. Or suggest it to the user to add it into the actual comment :)

Hi n0ne0ther,
I like your attempt for an review  "Landlord is buying people off to get positive reviews: 
However, you are wrong. I do not own any buildings. I rent and have moved several times in the past few years in NYC because of my troubles with the landlord, and slandering brokers.

Hi n0ne0ther,
If you truly believe our site and and myself to be 'a dishonest piece of shit.' Well sir, you are wrong.
I can understand your suspicion for reviews being fake due to the fact that most users only leave negative reviews, where as on the contrary most of the users so far have left positive reviews.
I hope the reviews that are being left are real and legitimate, and I believe in the paying it forward message. The purpose and reason this website was created was to allow renters to find apartments that are good for themselves in the future.
The company was started by myself and my friend, and we worked together with the developer of a social media site to bring it to what it is today.
The bitcoin giveaway is a way to incentivize users to rate their landlords for users in the future, as most users come onto our website just to search for a landlord instead of reviewing a landlord or property.
Your reviews could be either positive, or negative, but as long as it could potentially help another renter in the future, I will send some bits along your way. 
As a way of saying thank you from a future renter you may have helped.

I'm Thareeq, but this appears to be a fake review posted by the same user as the xdrpx.
Guys please do not try to abuse this giveaway as I am funding this entire project with money borrowed from the bank, and friends and family that wish to see  become a go to site for renters.
