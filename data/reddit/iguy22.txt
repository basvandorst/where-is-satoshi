You wish bub. 8k is the support. This will crash throughout the next week

Keep that powder dry 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:39:15
Atta boy!

You gotta have 5 or more bitcoin to have lightening fast trades and zero down time. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:06:54
Agreed

How can it only help bitcoin? You do realize wall street can now bet on BTC dropping right? Once wall street dips their hands into this you know they will be looking to manipulate it 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:57:08
Maybe

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:47
Amen 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:26:31
It's like you insulted their first born if you are bearish on bitcoin. Too funny. These sheep will hopefully learn the hard way 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:37
Okay there were a ton of people who bought high, you honestly don't think there would be a reaction like this? And rather these are all just "trolls"? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:08:33
Okay and if it never recovers do you promise to compile all “HODL” &amp; buy the dip posts

100s of false rumors are created each day. A broken clock is right twice a day.

My point is, the ones criticizing fiat are the same ones running right back to it when they are done with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:59:50
Just the tip?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:23
And people like you who are wayyyy too defensive about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:12:28
I tried skipping it too but says I need to verify when I actually try to buy coins. Will try the other ideas. Thanks

How long have you been holding? Do you never plan to in the foreseeable future ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:47:29
How is it foolish? Because it’s an opposing opinion to your own? 
1) is there not a lot of hate on fiat from bitcoin fanboys?
2) Do many not convert back to fiat?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:39
I said “many” here. Do you not agree that “many” here haven’t or wont ever convert back to fiat? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:14:31
Okay.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:06:01
No

Tomorrow the floor will be 3-4K
