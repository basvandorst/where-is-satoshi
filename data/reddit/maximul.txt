Lectures me about why we use words. Yawn.

Be careful bro you’re doing what every newbie investor or trader does when their investment halves overnight... suddenly they become a long term believer and do all sorts of mental gymnastics to convince themselves. 
But really, they do this because it’s too damn painful to admit they were wrong and to let go of the money they lost so quickly. The knock to your ego, that you were a fool, is hard to swallow. I see this over and over again in the stock market. People say holding when down takes strength.... no no no, that is all wrong. It takes tremendous strength to cut your losses. Leaving with something is better than leaving with nothing. Losses happen... but as soon as you become the type of person who rationalizes their losses, you have no chance as a long term investor. 
UNDERSTAND that things can get worse. They can always get worse. Don’t learn the hard way. 
If you believe, that’s fine, but make sure you’re not engaging in rationalization.

I’ve distilled the talking points I’ve heard over the last year both in person and online. I had to get that off my chest. 
I’m also reviewing my talking points for an upcoming debate with a... non-believer. 
Buy the dip my friend.

It will break up and decentralize the monetary system.... and centralize it neatly into Satoshi’s back pocket

Why would you want to dollar cost average on a bad investment though. That might be a good strategy for investments involving companies that actually provide some value.

How do you know that Satoshi hasn’t sold his coins ?

This picture literally sums up the puffed up, childish, naive delusion of bitcoin believers. This is like how a young child imagines their father to be before integrating more realistic and mature views of him.

Exactly. Rationalization at its purest

I’m aware it’s an accurate representation of what he means to the crypto community. That’s why it’s scary. It’s hero worship, idealization. I did not say anything about Andreas himself. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:57:09
Mhmm and why do you say that. I’m of the opinion he’s one of the richest men in the world.

Mix up my grammar ? Sock-puppet accounts? Wtf r u talking about

The real question is, are you going to be part of the revolution.. or are you going to be the slow-witted, old dinosaur that gets left behind that doesn’t even know what a fiat truly is. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:04:09
What is the point of crypto at all then if everything is going to be listed in dollars. I understand there are problems with Inflation of fiat, but I don’t make the mental leap to say “bitcoin will be the solution . “
So my point is that If bitcoin is the superior to fiat currency, why would things be listed in dollars. I’m talking about a hypothetical future where bitcoins are the “new currency”. 
I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt and making a giant leap by saying bitcoin will be the new currency. But let’s say it DOES become the standard currency, it wouldn’t even be remotely practical . 
This is despite all its other problems. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:00:21
Very vague my friend. I’ve never seen a company say “Our product is not very practical or usable at the moment. But one day it might be. Well figure out the solutions as we go. Please pay me now .”

It’s revolutionized Satoshis bank account that’s for sure.

My point is that bitcoin’s current value makes it infinitely impractical, which fundamentally proves it is worth much, much less than $4000. I’m not talking about volatility - yes that is a another problem. But even if the price stabilizes at $4000, it’s enormously impractical as a means of exchange. And then you have people here saying it will go higher, which doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.

Oh believe me, I have more substantial objections. But you haven’t answered my question. Is it not a valid question ?

And what do you mean he no longer has the private keys. What makes you think this 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:10:57
Yes but that doesn’t mean we will use bitcoin as an alternative. That is a wild speculation. For all you know we can just deflate the dollar and reset the system. 
The system is broken for many reasons. We don’t necessarily NEED a new currency . That is A leap of logic
