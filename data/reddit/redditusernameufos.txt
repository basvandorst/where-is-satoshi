He was either involved in something dodgy or was just a trader who didnt declare his gain to the tax office. It is august so the timing is about right.
If its the tax theyre after he'll have to pay it plus a fine. And they'll be keeping a close eye on him from now on.

that looks more like this...

Did he not declare to the the tax office?

Who are the bulls? Ive wondered for months, who the heck is buying? Everyone could see it was an historic bubble. Who is buying? Its like running to catch a train that is driving off a cliff in front of your eyes.

Go all in!!! Easy doubles. You'd be insane not to be all in.

Or traders see the only way to make money from bitcoin now is going short as a major "support" level is breached with no other "support" for another what 80&amp; drop from here? (p.s. i dont actually believe there is such a thing as support levels for bitcoin)

Good lord. Its participants like this that make me a no coiner. If this is the standard of critical thought shown by a decent proportion of crypto proponents, then stay away.
Supply vanishing forever and no new supply?? Take this out to its logical conclusion. 99% of "coins" have been lost forever. Handful of people holding a handful of coins, not trading them, not spending, just hording and the rest of the world not giving a crap about the silly collectors.
Kinda like now.

I know this is talking people of the edge, total defeatist talk.
Seriously though. Dont do it. Youre all young and life is way longer than you realise. You can bounce back you have plenty of time.

The velocity of money in the dark web drug trade determines the bottom. The only real market where its used as money. The rest is all speculation about store of value in a deflating, rising interest rates world.

Gold cant be replicated. You cant have gold 2.0. You CAN have bitcoin 2.0.

Not so pretty if you look at the last year.

Here's what hopefully they are all learning;
If you're a little guy and don't have money to just piss away - don't gamble. You will lose. That's why the gambling providers are rich and the gamblers are poor.
Oh, that's right, you're different. You're a soon to be hugely successful gamble. Mkay, off you go then.

So simple. Mass adoption from old people, who have all the money, any moment now.
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:28:26
After living from analogue through the digital revolution I know that with tech, early adopters get burned. Again and again and again. Hows that VCR collection going? Put it next to the encyclopedia. $13k for a plasma TV? Awesome! With laser disk player! Great buying! Just got a great price on a "120mhz Pentium" only $4000!!!! Tech gets cheaper over time. Dramatically, exponentially cheaper. Dont early adopt. Opposite to this, Bitcoin will get more expensive as/if use increases. Why would late adopters join at a crushing price? Is this illegal FUD? Dont want to be branded a paid blasphemer.
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:34:06
I guess the late adopters wont have a choice hey?? They'll be ruined. All hail the new Bitcoin Rothswhales!! Freeeeeeedom!!!!
