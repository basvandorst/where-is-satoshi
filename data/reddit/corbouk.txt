Prepare for the bounce

Because of diversification in investments other than crypto.   Bitcoin is my high risk investment.  Others are more traditional and low risk.

Your post history lends such credibility /s

Their position hasn't changed.  The media have reported the govt acting on what they said they would already do as new news.  There is no ban.  Only regulation, which we already know.  Blame the media.

What value would BTC need to hit for you to consider eating one of your testicles?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:27:32
It's a good point.  I'd say bitcoin is in the mainstream but not mainstream however.  It's also far easier for people to withdraw their initial investment from bitcoin than a mortgage if they are sensible about it.

As does passing off an alt coin with the bitcoin name, calling it the real bitcoin on bitcoin.com which you own and generally being a prick.  Evolution through open source is positive.  Bcash is nothing but negative.

Forza bitcoin

No doubt there will always be losers.  Will be interesting to see how it plays out

No sir, crypto is firmly in the high risk portion of my portfolio.  So back to you, what is it you find humourous about a stranger losing money?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:50:51

A history lesson.  If you don't learn from the past you will repeat mistakes.  Don't be blinded so much as to ignore history.

Another 400 down before the miners return and the bounce
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:48:32
Plenty of existing profit from this journey so far my friend.  Short term thinking investors are the poorest.

Why buy it, when we got it for free holding coin at a fork.

Anyone who uses the word inevitable in the context of crypto currencies is inevitably not talking sense

The sad thing is the whole debacle is so bad for cryptos image.  Absolute farce.

Hi I just wanted to come back to you so we can get our diaries worked out for when you might be back for a laugh.  Do you have a date in mind given the new BTC high?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:02:25
Got a date in mind?  I'd like to be dressed for the occasion
