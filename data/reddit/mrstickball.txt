This is the entire issue. How do you get bitcoins now? You have to send fiat to some crazy exchanges and get it, find someone local, or mine it. 
As soon as someone makes it easy for a person to buy/sell it, then Bitcoin will really get somewhere. Until that happens.. Its going to be a constant uphill battle.

Every time someone posts this message from Coinbase, they can simply contact their customer service, and tell them that they fully intended to purchase the BTC at the given spot rate - its even happened to me as well.
What do they do? Apologize, and push the order through at whatever price you requested the BTC at. Its not a big deal - everyone should know that CoinBase does this from time to time as an automated safeguard. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 23:09:03
DHL? Yes. They operate in almost every country in the world.. If you go to a terminal, they have a map of when they entered the market in a given country. Its essentially a map of every breakup/fragmentation in the world in the past 20 years. Heck, they're (already) in South Sudan.

That is kind of my point. Are there tons of scams around in Bitcoin securities? Absolutely. Should they be fined, shut down, and their owners jailed? Sure, if there was enough deception involved. By all means, they should be persecuted.
But should every business be targeted that is trying to crowdfund - something that the government itself has said should be allowed via Title 3 of the 2009 Jobs Act? No, I don't think so.

The other big part is exposure to global currency rates. DHL takes payments in every currency. Bitcoin would allow them to do one simple rate, reducing volatility to the smaller countries they deal with (Zimbabwe, North Korea... Not like they'd use it, ha).

The bigger issue is the cost of making an ASIC for any given system. For example, take Curecoin's Folding @ Home approach to coin payouts. ASICs exist for protein folding, but are so unfathomably expensive, that so few people can use them, that they instead break the work up for GPUs, which offers a pretty level playing field.

Actually, the fact that Krugman hates Bitcoin has no bearing on my dislike of him. I had no idea he had an issue with it until a few months ago.

10 minute block times are hard coded into Bitcoin. Every successive altcoin has done away with such an atrocious block time. Litecoin is 2.5 minutes, Dogecoin is 1 minute, and some such as Worldcoin go as low as like... 15-20 seconds. The lower you go, the more problems you have (as there isn't enough time to reach block consensus, so more orphans are created). But 10 minutes has been show to be pretty bad, given the robustness of 1-2.5 minute block times.

FWIW, if you do that much business, a legitimate merchants account will be a lot cheaper. Bitcoin is best, but do not think that PayPal is a close second. Its literally the worst available merchant in terms of fees.

Put a QR code up on a screen, and have them scan it for free Bitcoins (some trivial amount - say 10 RMB worth for a few moments). Demonstrate how quick and easy it is to send payments to a multitude of people.
Then tell them that it is this easy regardless of where you are in the world. An American can pay for factory goods without a bank middleman taking 3-5% and waiting 7 days to clear. Show them that the cost to involve themselves in this activity approaches 0%, and they should really enjoy it. 
Show them that this is how all payments will be made on the internet in 10 years - without banks or 3rd parties involving themselves in the process, and taking money away from the business owner, or the customer.

Not only that, think of the savings DHL would have on the accounting side. It makes too much sense for multi-national corporations. They probably have to spend 5% of their revenues between accounting/TX fees/compliance for payments. With Bitcoin, that drops to maybe 1%, tops, in compliance and conversion costs.
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:39:14
Currently? No.
By the time they would integrate it? Yes. Remember that we're talking about a currency with a $10 billion market cap. The forex market in 2007 was $3.98 trillion in DAILY volume, with $37 billion just in currency swaps. Comparatively, BTC daily volume is the fiat equivalent of $30 million.

Doesn't matter for us that attempt to use it for business purposes. I bought a fair amount of BTC at $550 to send to a manufacturer.

I explained to corporate the following:
1) The time it'd take to code a payment system could be done internally by your development team, reducing your fees effectively to 0%. If done externally, you would be looking at most 1%. I then told him I knew interchange rate was 1.8% + currency fees. Since DHL is global, I told him that the overall fee structure was likely close to 3% (since we do global payment systems too), so such a pitch to corporate could save them 2% on their entire payment structure. That's hundreds of millions of dollars saved annually. 
2) Security can be analyzed and done internally by their team. In regards to theft/fraud, I explained that the public ledger - why we have mining machines - prevents fraud by proofing the blockchain every 10 minutes with an encrypted verification system. He seemed to believe this answer was very, very good.

I'll get downvoted, but:
People say Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver, and this-or-that is bronze, copper, or some sort of other PM. Its really not
Bitcoin is the Apple 2. Litecoin is the Commodore 64. Alts are various iterations of the computers we saw in the '80s. Eventually, the PC will come out and change how we view cryptos. 
To me, the underlying value of cryptocurrencies - nearly instant transaction speeds, vastly cheaper to take payments from (as a merchant), send multiple payments, pay for goods/products to factories, and so on makes it much better than other services like PayPal that are beholden to a lot of garbage politics that either they or the powers that be have put into place.
Bitcoin is the genesis of something great. I doubt my daughter will use Bitcoin when she is old enough to buy a car (she's 2), but she is going to recognize *it* just like I do today - no different than a person with an Apple 2 would recognize a computer today. The methods and measures may differ, but the overall reasoning behind the vehicle will still be there.

Bitcoin doesn't need a chargeback system. As a merchant, chargebacks are horrible, and are fraught with all kinds of fraud, and added expenses to merchants, and then to consumers. PayPal has chargebacks, and they can easily screw you over despite doing everything right by their book.
What Bitcoin needs us a universal, systemic trust system integrated into each private wallet. This would allow people to post public addresses, and allow others to sign feedback to said accounts, proving their legitimacy. Some merchant processors do this already like CoinPayments.net, allowing for positive/negative feedback. Having a P2P trust system after payments would be invaluable, and merchants/users could use API's to show their trust rating, much like businesses show off their Yelp, Urbanspoon, or Better Business Bureau rating.
But chargebacks... Those will cause far more problems than they solve.

Until it collapses due to hyper-deflation. 
BTC is great, and I hope it gets more adoption, but the monetary policy (as I understand it) will not work for full adoption. As the number of coins minted continues to go down, it will invariably cause a lot of issues in the long term - much like what current fiat economic policy has.
I hope they rectify this before its too late. Inflationary policy is just as bad as deflationary policy. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:27:03

For Bitcoin, hardware has evolved into system(s) that can ONLY process Bitcoin's sha256 algorithm. They can do this insanely well, but only mine sha256 cryptocurrencies. 
For example, a very high end AMD Radeon 7950 GPU (about $300-400 when it was available - AMD has moved on to the R9 series, so a comparable card would be the R9 280X) could process about 600 million hashes/second. Current Bitcoin ASIC hardware like the ASICMiner Cube (about $1000 depending on where you buy from) processes about 30,000 million hashes/second, and consumes the same amount of electricity as the AMD 7950. 
The GPU can obviously do a lot more than mine BTC, whereas the ASIC cannot. This is (also) why other coins have moved to different algorithms to discourage ASIC development, like Litecoin. A Bitcoin ASIC cannot work on Litecoin in the least, whereas the same GPU could hash either. 
So in other words, an ASIC miner can do nothing but mine. However, a high-end GPU rig could do a lot more. I have a friend that helps build Litecoin machines + works IT at a major power company. Our Litecoin rigs are very similar to what they use to encrypt data inside their company (actually, ours are probably more robust than this huge electric company, ha ha).

It may sound sarcastic, but I'm serious.
As an American, I am very scared of the trajectory our nation is on. Our government spends far more than it takes in, and prints the difference off. If we continue at this rate for 10-15 more years, we will go bankrupt.
If we go bankrupt, what has been seen in Greece will look like a walk in the park. Imagine 40 million people being unable to swipe their EBTs at the gas station, because they are being rejected. Throw in the fact we have the 2nd amendment, and it could get pretty scary pretty quick. At that point, the feds won't be worrying about Gox.

No, I wasn't. I was getting a payment from someone, and accepted BTC. Within 2hrs, the price had dropped 10%. I withdrew BTC immediately after confirmation. 


So what is a major transaction to you in BTC? To me, $5,000 USD is quite a bit of money, and magically losing 10% of it to market swings is not desirable.


Law of averages. 24 confirms on LTC are less likely to see huge swings in confirmation time vs. 6 Bitcoin confirmations, even if the target is the same amount of time.

But.....Bitcoin doesn't increase at a set rate. At least not indefinitely. They are going to halve the payouts soon, from 25 to 12.5 per block. This effectively will halve the monetary supply, will it not? 
So I have to ask: What happens when we reach that cap, as well as the 21 quadrillion satoshi cap? Then there will be no additional monetary supply - of bitcoins at least. What happens when 1 satoshi is worth 1 million pounds of flour? How does one engage in economic activity when their products are worthless compared to a bitcoin? Its the very opposite of why inflation is bad.

@_date: 2013-11-19 22:14:52
Hi Mr. Moran,
I am a small business owner in the State of Ohio. I use Bitcoins because in an online world, other forms of payment haven't adapted to changes in the market, and we are still working with archaic models by credit card companies. These companies charge very large fees, of which the [Frank-Dodd bill]( attempted to reduce for the consumer, as well as the business owner. 
Bitcoin represents a new way to transact money for essentially non-existent transaction fees, which help businesses transact in the global economy. If I work with a major company such as Chase PaymenTech, my costs to do business with customers can vary from 1.5% to 3.5%. With Bitcoin, its 0% to 1.0%. This represents a sizable cost savings for my business. The same can be said for transacting in B2B services as well, which again is very sizable. 
If the US restricts Bitcoins from being usable in the United States to transact with, then global competitors will easily undermine my business, and many others, as we will continue to lag behind other countries' willingness to embrace new technology. Bitcoins represent a paradigm shift in regards to online transactions. I hope that the US embraces it, rather than rejects it, as it will hurt us more than our fears of the currency.

@_date: 2013-05-30 13:59:26
To play devil's advocate here:
Unfortunately, governments will invariably want to control and regulate any currency, period. With MtGox complying, it gives the government less ability to go after them, as they are attempting to comply with any and all laws that deal with FinCen regulations in the US. 
If you want anonymity, you need to stay within BTC. For mass-market adoption, verification like this will (sadly) be commonplace.
On the upside, when the US government collapses along with its fiat, it won't have the money to support these types of thuggish tactics to get entities to comply with them.

I've used BTC as a transactional currency for major amounts of money ($5,000) and lost a lot of it in simple market swings, because confirmation times were "Estimated" at 6 blocks, but ended up being nearly two hours, because it took extra time for blocks to be found.
This is a huge achilles heel for Bitcoin adoption in the long run. The reality is that BTC is the genesis of cryptocurrency, but likely not the perfection of it.
Is Litecoin perfect? Absolutely not. It won't be the last cryptocurrency, but I think it does prove that faster confirmations and more coinage are advantageous.

Even then, credit unions aren't able to work with businesses. I asked my local union to accept me, but they said they simply were not set up to handle businesses at all. I shudder to think what they'd do if I was sending a dozen wires a month to all the corners of the Earth for strange products.

Reselling them, but I am looking into a setup, as the wholesale cost (for the first time) actually makes it viable. Its actually slightly cheaper to buy and deploy these than it would be to buy an Avalon or other in-stock miner on the secondary market.
@_date: 2013-10-26 21:47:52
Something similar happened to me. I got 11k frozen in my account. 
Sadly, there is very little you can do. I would call them and ask them what the security issue was. That sounds like it may be fix-able. I sold about 125,000 in miners and never had that kind of statement made. I got hit with a few chargebacks, so my ban was slightly different.

My assumption is that they haven't fully implemented it. As per some posters, they can do CoinBase payments via Chase easily (I have as well, on my personal account). I got shut down when they saw that my merchant account was selling BTC-related hardware.

If LTC is not a reliable long-term investment, then I would question why any cryptocurrency is going to be a long-term investment.
It's nice that you want to be a BTC purist, but the reality is that cryptocurrency is so new, and so revolutionary, that there can and will be competitors that may be as viable as the entity that started it all.
Sure, LTC isn't close to what BTC is right now as a vehicle of exchange. But where was BTC at this point in time in its lifespan? The reality is that for being an altcoin, and a newer one at that, its made some pretty strong headway.
The real question is as to what happens to adoption once its integrated on exchanges that aren't in some Russian mobsters' basement. 
Having dealt with both currencies a bit as a vehicle of exchange, Litecoin does have some very enjoyable advantages, mainly due to confirmation times allowing for less market fluctuations for transfers, among other things. 
Yes, it may seem egregious that LTC could challenge a system it essentially copied, but this is how industries form. I'm sure that Henry Ford was angry when companies began to copy parts of the Model-T and the assembly line. But competition must happen for cryptos to take over. Its a $1.1+ billion dollar market, and will only get larger, especially as new coins come and compete for being the preferred vehicle for monetary transactions.

You don't follow Litecoin, do you? LTC has had close to 25% of the relative network hashpower of bitcoin, factoring in that Scrypt is 1000x harder to solve than sha256 for weeks, if not a month or two.
If you adjust for scrypt, its been sitting at 20 TH for weeks - which was right at that 25% margin before the huge onset of ASICs in the past week.

Seemingly because I interacted with Bitcoin at all via their merchant processor (e.g. hardware).

I've accepted Bitcoin far longer than I have credit cards. 90% of our buyers want to use credit cards, so they can get into bitcoin. None of these people are reachable if we sold via BTC-only. 
Transitioning from fiat to BTC takes time. BTC-only companies will never, ever, attract the casual miner or person interested in BTC. For now, credit cards are a necessary evil in the world. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:26:33
I am. But only after having them freeze $20,000 in credit card payments made to my business. This is why someone probably should care. If you're a business, you cannot do anything with Chase, or you will risk getting monies frozen.

I'm running a test to see how it works. At the moment, a simple E-mail to the account connected to the buyer seems to work pretty well on filtering out some fraud. I put up about 15 BTC worth @ $170/BTC, and sold out within a few hours. 20% of the purchasers were fraudulent thus far, but a fair bit have jumped through the E-mail and contact hoops.
I'm sure a viable method would be met with some pretty huge sales on Ebay. Again.... $170 per BTC and sold out in about 5-6hrs for 15 BTC.
@_date: 2013-08-02 23:56:47
I am looking at doing some hybrid rigs... From what I see, I could run something like 100 (33 GHs) on one of my GPU rigs... So I could do a combo LTC/BTC rig, thereby saving some extra resources, as I simply have to pay for hubs (that I get @ wholesale from the factory on top, hehe).

Ever heard of international wires? Online banking? Where I live, there's a huge chasm typically between smaller, local banks and larger ones that are capable of handling international business in an efficient manner. My brother is having this problem with a regional bank. They are open 2hrs less each day, have rather poor online banking, and charge 3x as much for an international wire. That means that I will have to tack on $100 extra USD for each order I make for components... Adding the costs to my customers. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 21:21:49
This is his strategy in a nutshell. 
They're constantly reducing the price to meet demand as other ASICs come on market. They know that they can do this due to order volume. I'm a big fan of ASICMiner because they are actually delivering at whatever volume you want to buy. I placed an order for 400 USBs on Saturday. I got them today... Can't say that about any other company. Period.

Let me ask you this:
How are we going to balance the ~1 trillion USD annual deficit?

For that volume, consensus seems to be no.
In my case, I was doing well over &gt;$10,000/mo on CoinBase, and then my Merchant account did $50,000 in a few days on BTC products.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:21:46
They are holding $20,000 of it as a "Reserve" that they are keeping for 6 months. Then they release whats left of it less chargebacks/refunds.

FYI, the price and quote is somewhat wrong.
The 0.10 BTC price was for those that had recently placed an order with Friedcat at the 0.99 BTC level. Approximately 30-33% of said orders were given coupons for the 0.10 BTC price on ASICs.
I can confirm this. I placed an order with him a few weeks ago for 450 Erupters @ 0.99. I was allowed to recently purchase 150 @ 0.10 + whatever I ordered after that @ the 0.45 level (will be 0.42 at the 1000 level).

Honestly, I think that the 15 THs rig may be the smartest of any purchases.
That is *if* BFL could deliver it in a timely manner. The real issue with ASIC mining is adoption rate. Its really not about the speed of the miner, but how fast you get the rig. I'm going to go out a ledge and say that no one has bought it, but BFL would probably insure that it was shipped rather quick vs. other products, as their margin of return on the beast may be better on smaller products.
(Having said that, I wish I had $30k to burn. If I did, I would absolutely be buying one).

So who here is going to pony up the cash to start up a US exchange or other major exchange that can prevent these debacles?
That is really the question that has to be answered. Until it does, all these threads are useless. If you want to change the system, then do so - nothing is stopping you. 
The reality of the situation is far different than most want to make it out to be. Good exchanges cost lots of hard currency to build. I recommend that the alleged Bitcoin Millionaires put their currencies together, and get the needed approvals from the US Government to build a legitimate exchange. Again, until that happens, everyone will be given into the whims of Mt Gox, BTC-E, Vircurex, and other shady exchanges.

There will be far more variance in Bitcoins than any other coin in regards to confirmation time. That is one advantage that newer coins have got right.
I never said that LTC was less volatile. Just less prone to longer (and shorter) confirmation times due to less variance.
I don't have a problem opening a Bitpay merchant account for when I do more BTC business. This large transaction was trans-atlantic and a test run of doing larger business instead of bank wires. The issue was that it cost me far, far more money than a bank wire due to volatility.. Not a great thing.

The problem is that a lot of Bitcoin early-adopters are Anarchist-capitalists that believe any tax is a form of theft. 
Of course, if you're going to transact or use BTC as a form of currency, its going to be treated as a form of currency - meaning you still have to pay out from the profits. 
I'd rather pay taxes on 'em and have huge savings from BTC and other crypto's intrinsic values as opposed to no taxes, and not having them around.

Austrians can create more monetary supply through work, though.
You can't do that with Bitcoin.
Call me crazy, but I think its still a fatal flaw of Bitcoin. Less than 50% of the coins even out there have been traded once. Unless Bitcoin can figure out how to redeem lost coins, the platform will eventually be doomed. 
Unless I'm wrong in that understanding, its an Achilles heel. If I lose a bitcoin to a bad address, what can be done? If the answer is nothing, we'll eventually see more and more coins lost to the abyss, and there simply won't be enough to go around.
Deflation can be as bad as inflation. Last I checked, Austrians liked gold and silver because the supply comes at a cost. There is no supply in Bitcoin, outside of what has already been created - the 21 million BTC. That is a problem if BTC is to take over fiat.
