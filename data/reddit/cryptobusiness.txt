No need to worry about the 17k wall on GDAX guys, it is just a small size. When people are in FOMO mode, you can see 300-600 BTC market buy in 1 minute, so 337 BTC wall is just so small.

What s the point of iPhone when people already have Nokia?
The world need competition to grow dude.

Dude, it ups 2k in a few hours and you are still disappointed?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:45
Yup, I know that, but short the future do not give any damage to the real BTC market. That is what I mean. Only real selling BTC pressure can crash the market.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:27:42
The best case is people wait up to 6pm, see no high volume price drop, then FOMO in.

There is a FUD about market will crash on Monday when BTC future is open, and the whales who bought BTC at low price will crash the market to get more profit from shorting the BTC contract. I must say it is a dump FUD, dump idea. Everybody need to know that BTC future:
- Settle at specific date, usually weeks or months after the contract is open, so no dump whales will try to crash the BTC at the start of the BTC future and face the risk of price jummping back on the Expired Date. That is just not logic at all.                                                            
The price correction from 2 days ago is very good for BTC in the long term. First of all now we are building some supports on the way down. Secondly, we corrected to Fibo 78.6% and bound back with good volume too, it means somehow we reached the Bottom for this correction. What is greater when BTC Future open, and BTC price is at the bottom of a correction? People will FOMO in soon and push the price to ATH again. I even short BTC ratio vs another Alts at the moment since when we going up again, it will be a nightmare for all Alts.

I think it is out of trade time window? Maybe for information only and people can only long/short contract on Monday?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:10:53
Ya, but if they want to manipulate, they gotta do it on or 1-2 days before the expired date, too risky to push price down on the first day, and see it recover on the expired date. Do you know if CBOE and CME public the contract information? Like how much volume, how many contracts short, how many contracts long?

You will always see these walls in uptrend, as well as the opposite wall in downtrend. The more wall, the better in uptrend, because when a wall broke down, buy side will gain more confident to push the price higher, or we call it FOMO.

People are waiting for BTC correction? Too late we already corrected. Take a look at my chart then.

Fear of missing out. Like you see BTC break all time high, you fear if you do not buy now, you may have to buy at higher price in the future, so you just place market buy order to buy at whatever price. That is like the natural of human.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:13:28
Just hold, we just had a hard correction, recovered and get new ATH after 9 days. CME launch is a good news, there is no reason we will dip too much, but there is much more reason we will rise higher.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:47:42
The market is in an amazing bull run, if people want to short the future contract, they gotta own bitcoin first, not a few k, but 50,000 at least to manipulate the market at this point. In addition as I see CME and CBOE only limit 5,000 contract (5,000 BTC) per account, so it is a downside for some1 who wanna short. And the most importantly, the future contract expire in a specific day, so I do not think we need to worry about 10 Dec or 18 Dec, maybe weeks later on expired date.

Actually it is more people place sell order on the order book. But it can be faked all the time so I do not use order book as the indicator (Place order there, but pull it off later). Believe me, I see more giant selling order, but when people FOMO, there is nothing can stop the price, unless someone dump a few thousands BTC in 1 minute.

That is it, we need this high volume to confirm we are at the bottom. Let take a look at the last bottom at 6k and 6k4, all have massive volume, especially high volume at some moment like this.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:36:04
It may pop at $10,000 or $15,000 or $20,000. Hard to tell the future dude, but remember that when it pop (3x high volume, price decrease more than 50% in 24 hours) , you will always have a chance to sell it at the price of dead cat bounce (about 80-85% of the peak price)
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:38:31
No it does not only work that way, actually if you already had so many BTC, like 10,000, and you want to make it 15,000? You sell 10,000 at price $4500, buy back 15,000 at price of $3000, so you have 5,000 BTC profit.

Nope, all were based on true event and the following consequence. Do you see how the market react when the official news was out? All Chinese exchange announced their schedule closure and then Bitcoin price rise from 2900$ to 3700$. Why? Cause people have no doubt now. Doubt and Rumor are never good for a young market. If you still do not get the picture, we better stop the discussion.

It was uncertain news, only encourage people to short, which is not good for the market health. If he chose to remain silent, thing could be much better by now. In addition, the announcement of BTCC via twitter looks so simple and fishy, they do not even announce the news on the main website, and it is also related to the ICO ban from 4/9, not the exchange rumor ban from later day.
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:27:10
Of course shorting is an option, but remember the Crypto world is pretty young, spreading the unverified or unofficial news can trigger the massive fear from investor, which crash the entire market. I do not say shorting is bad, I mean spreading the unverified news in this situation will trigger short potion, and it is bad for the market. It is not prohibited, but it is bad, and from the Litecoin leader like Charlie, it was a very bad move.

Lel, spreading the unofficial and unverified news and told people to hold. Did you hold? I just told the truth, base on what happened.If you do not like it, so move on.
