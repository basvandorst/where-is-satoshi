Grand Theft Auto 23.
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:56:25
The license plate of the Fiat is 4785.   7-5 is 2 and 8-5 is 3.  Not only does this give us 23, but 4 times 23 is 96.  1996 was the year that Bill Clinton signed the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendment, requiring FIOA requests to be available in electronic formats.  Additionally, the same year Clinton signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Treaty Ban.
'96 was the first year they felt safe enough to begin making public records more easily available and assured enough of their control to begin reducing the size of international nuclear deterrents.  Of course, this shouldn't surprise us, because 9+6 is 15. . . one of five.  All things happen in fives, or more precisely 2+3s or 23s.
The price of Bitcoin at the time of the posting was $230 USD, or 23 X 10.  Clearly, Bitcoin is seen as ten times the threat to the Secret Order as . . . something, what?  The clue is in the license plate, the letters LAA.  L is the 11th letter of the alphabet and A of course is the 1st.  1111.  1111. . . 4 again.    The Illuminated Agenda is under 10 times the threat it faced in 1996. . . and they fear Bitcoin.  
This is a warning.  The warning, that if they cannot control us, if we do not bow to the Great Eye atop the pyramid, they will &lt;fnord&gt;inflict upon us a world of hurt and subjugation.&lt;/fnord&gt;  Their method of doing so is even told to us blatantly.  They delivered it with a fiat.  This is a declaration of all out, economic war.
They fear us.  This new electronic world has spawned a New World Chaos, the Universe's natural immune response to their grasping Order.  A Universe they cannot control, free from their machinations, unentangled, liberated for the first time since the submersion of Atlantis and the deactivation of the crystal grid.  WE ARE A THREAT TO THEM!
They want us to know, they're toying with us.
**To answer your question** the odds of such a thing happening at random are nil.  This is part of their plan.   A message, to let us know we are not.

Guy without a bank account who has to send money sometimes.  Can confirm.

Because. . . fuck banks.

I get paid in cash.  My phone is covered by my company, my internet by my land lord.  And I know where to buy feeless prepaid cards.  I neither know nor need to know my credit rating.  What would I do with it?  Borrow money?  Why?
Any money I lose because "fuck banks" I don't think of as a loss.  I will happily consider it a "non-participation fee."  A small price to pay to be as non-party as possible to their ongoing abuse of the world and the human race.

OMG, an app like this would be SO useful to me I can't even express.  Especially if it could integrate with Google Maps on my phone and tell me where Bitcoin Wireless hotspots are.

You don't need to seize tor nodes at random.
Let's say they're telling the truth.  Tor is still safe, all the upheaval lately is just a big coincidence: Great, life can continue as usual.
Let's say I'm right though and it's a big lie?
If we have reason to suspect the network may be compromised and we CAN'T PROVE IT'S NOT, then we SHOULD TREAT IT AS COMPROMISED.

This. This. This.  A million times.
1) Two methods are known to compromise hidden services and a third exists to compromise users.  These are all well detailed in scientific papers.  But the Feds are talking like they know nothing about that.
2) They bust Freedom Hosting because "old fashioned gum shoe finance investigation" Atlantis closes because "unfixable security issues" and then SR goes down all within months of each other?  
LEAs claim good, old fashioned gum shoe work?  I don't buy it.
