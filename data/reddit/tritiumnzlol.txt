I agree- visualizing it would be tricky. to view the "health" on LN at a glace a chart similar to [the mempools ones]( would work pretty well having:




and then colour the bands into average number of jumps required?
not sure just spit balling.

Correct it makes sense to send the emails if the private keys ARE encrypted, which is what i'm suggesting above.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:11:34
Presumably blockchain.info, as that is where it is asking you to pull your keys out of. 
It makes sense if the hackers only got access to the user account's email address as that probably isn't encrypted like the client's passwords and private keys should be.

Perfectly doable. as the liquid becomes more scarce the price goes up, more people enticed to cash out more liquid becomes available and so on the cycle repeats as the price rises.
The end result would be buyer ends up with some amount of coins less than 825,000 as they wouldn't all be purchased at the current rate.

Idea for a trading bot.
* Uses the Reddit API to watch this sub for links to images with over some threshold of upvotes 
* Compare the images of interest's md5 hashes to our wee roller coaster guy here (both up and down).
* Sell bitcoins when up guy is posted, buys bitcoins when down guy is posted.

I think the steadiness of the price increase over the last year is encouraging. It's fairly inevitable as difficulty increases and rewards decrease that the price will rise over time, to match the demand.
