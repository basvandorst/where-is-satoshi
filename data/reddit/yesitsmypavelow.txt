Shrapnel goes in my pocket and later gets dumped in the jar by my nightstand.  Eventually- maybe every year or two it gets rolled up, cashed in for bills or deposited

That’s literally what we call the little aluminum ¥1 coins

It’ll be the next thing unless it isn’t. Basically a 50% chance!

As an American southerner living in Japan, it took me a while to shake off the tendency to to say “yens”

Here’s what you should do:
Figure out the absolute *most* you can lose. Make peace with the idea that that much is already gone and it’ll make this next part super easy.
So put *twice* that much into BTC. All at once, dollar-cost average, it doesn’t really matter. Just do it.
Then, worst case scenario if it drops 50%, cash out and you’re back where you started. Best case scenario BTC goes up a brazillion dollars and you’re twice as rich as you would be if you’d only put the amount you thought you were ok with losing.

“Bit-what? Oh yeah I heard them talking about that in the news I think. Got rid of that stuff *ages* ago. Someone told me it was a scam. I’m actually broke lol... can I hold a dolla btw (you know, since I’m broke)?”
Or something like that

We call it a cockscrew sometimes. It’s a lot more fun for her than it is for me though tbh
