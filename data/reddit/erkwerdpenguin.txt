BoomBust and Keiser Report have both been positively reporting on BTC for about half a year. Both are broadcast on Russia Today news outlet.

Yeah I had heard Keiser has one of the largest btc accounts privately held, so it would be in his interest to pump as much as he can on his show.  I'm also pretty sure Erin Ade of Boom Bust has invested as well.

They've been doing this for months now, as well as broadcasting positive bitcoin related shows on Keiser Report and Boom Bust.  Its a great resource to catch btc news on TV.

The title was to grab attention, but I'm also confident of the future.  But you have to admit, it's up against some big opponents.  I'm just trying to gauge people's reactions while still keeping my feet on the ground.  I'm just thinking this was the cold shower we needed.  Time to dry off and put some clothes on.  There's a big day ahead.

I think without the bubble to fuel new coming investors, interest will subside.  I certainly don't think we will see the same crazy rate of growth from here on out, but I would really like to be proven wrong :).  It seems the press was just waiting for this to happen, now everybody is saying "told you so", which is scaring away a lot of potential investors.  One things for sure, this is going to take some time to recover from...  Once again, someone please prove me wrong :'(

Once again, I said I didn't sell, I'm not out yet. I know this has happened before, and I'm certainly hoping for a massive recovery.  BUT, it's not me that you should be worried about understanding bitcoin, I'm already involved, it's everybody else on the outside that sees this massive dip and is completely scared away from something they already don't understand.  Bitcoin is going nowhere if it is not adopted by more people.

At this point in time, I think the concept is just way too complicated for people to understand.  I know the comparison between the early days of the internet, but this idea is just too new, too hard to understand for computer/economic illiterate people.  The only thing presently fueling the fire is the potential gains.  Nobody wants a bitcoin, they want more fiat currency.  I'm really afraid of "bitcoinmania."
