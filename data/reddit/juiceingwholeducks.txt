ya, but since no customers btc was lost(not that it could have been) publicizing it is the best route, otherwise people would be like, shapeshift is offline, I dont understand why, better not use them next time

I must have missed the spot where they ever mentioned bitcoin

hope you kept a way into the wallets, I can see those making it to be destroyed before anyone who realizes what they are gets them

I guess these crypto coins are better bought when needed, if you didnt have a huge stash, hopping to the next coin when the previous one is looking hijacked wouldnt be a big deal, if you didnt have too much invested

maybe i read it wrong, but to me it sounded like the problem was nnot with fiat or bitcoin, but with coinbase
I encountered multiple problems trying to buy too(mind you some,well most of it was with fiat companies), first i tried circle, and didnt have a phone, so I emailed them, they told me to borrow a friends phone to sign up as I only need to be sent a verification PIN once, then I only needed to use google authentication  if I didnt want to use a PIN after that (wait what phone am I downloading google auth on), so I sign up with a friends phone, then find out I cant link up canadian bank accounts (why they didnt tell me this earlier who knows)
so then I find out about quickbt, great interac bitcoins, but my interac online wouldnt work (a quick google search seems to be that visa hasnt updated my new card or something)
finally I got my coin from a reddit user
but ya, I think a lot of the services are just as fudged or more than fiat companies, local bitcoins is they way to go if you are in a city, otherwise reddit or other fourms you frequent are just as good
the services set all these limits and hoops to jump through cause otherwise people rip them off, which makes it really frustrating

@_date: 2016-01-06 02:38:52

@_date: 2016-03-02 19:48:30
