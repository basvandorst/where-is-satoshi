Are we talking about alts here ? Doesn't that belong to r/cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:28:11
Why an hidden motive when the motive, more space, is so clear? And it's an open, public project right?

Ram? Where do you store the mempool?
Bandwidth.. You know what 8mb are right? 2017 right? Thin blocks right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:36:39
Maybe the mods went on vacation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:42:40
Men, I was not talking to you
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:53:55
Micropayments with recurring transactions, like tabs you know.
All this inside a channel, that you have to fund. Etc.
It's that simple.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:12:21
Are you going to enforce a soft-fork? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:11:19
Just saying, if we were to talk about the fork wmnbn that wouldn't happen. I agree with you of course.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:03:11
Serious question have you been banned from r/btc? You have to be a special kind of guy. That sub seems rough on the outside, but truly is not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:05:03
because bandwidth.. and ram and storage.. /s
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:06:50
great meme

Gold has been around for some time. And it's pretty much decentralized.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:41:06
Thanks for your answers. 
I hope too that enough people can see the good in bitcoin. Even with some things happening on the internet, people usually can figure what's relevant eventually, and are able to communicate with each other.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:20:56
Mining is completely fundamental to bitcoin.. ROI and investments don't even touch the meaning and importance of mining.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:56:53
Has your friend bubshoe asked all of them? Does he have to lie to make a point?
bitcoin cash, what is that?
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:28:30
No, no. We enter in the field of spam, but here we go. The blocks were full, bitcoin was being more used. There is no one that can tell what are legitimate transactions or not - hence teh fees.
So, at the time there is this random cap on the blocksize that is stalling transaction times and higher fees than normal, some value propositions of bitcoin no longer have a place in the blockchain. And until alternatives appear, it makes perfect sense to continue to allow bitcoin to be a good, useful currency by having again enough space. That's why.
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:22:22
Bigger blocks add up maybe 0.2% on the costs of running a miner. How can that incentivize centralization? The flip part is that for a small cost the network grows.. that's the goal right?.. and with that hopefully more people and adoption, and so more value.
Because it's an open network, more value calls for interest, investments, diversification.
Why do you want to pay for transactions? Wouldn't the goal be to have them not expensive?
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:46:07


That's a lie, [here.] (
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:01:27
Of course it makes, doubles the richness needed to keep flooding the network with dummy transactions (I didn't completely got why to do that, but ok). For a small price in hardware, while at the same time helping the miners, and bitcoin in general with more money, from their transactions!


it has been discussed for two years now.. you have to be kidding
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:37:18
Ye, desasters are the worse, man!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:52
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:06:10
Well, even if you select the last 2 years, you are left with 63 developers.. If you want to count Gavin and Mike Hearn has active core developers.. Sure go ahead
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:06:44
More buyers than sellers
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:25:21


Sorry, I didn't meant to bother with it. I'm glad you understood my point though, really. The thing is that the point is mainly political, the difference is not relevant to hurt bitcoin, on the contrary. 
and from the assumption they are experts, it's about code, not necessarily about geo-politics / market-dinamics / price-hardware fluctuations / rates-of adoption / .. sorry what I mean is, the actual difference in size is irrelevant for bandwidth and storage, how can someone make a point about that?
Miners that don't have internet connection, or have money for a one Tb disk but not two Tb? 
What's the problem?
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:19:11


So are you saying that you want a static state bitcoin? Probably not, you are saying that you want a decentralized way to change rules so that there's no entity in control, right?


Who says they are top level programmers and irreplaceable? Them selves? Or others that cannot even understand their work (top level work) and so are not able say and know that. What happens with all those other Core programmers that left in the mean time? Are these ones, the good ones?
 
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:29:47
many currencies had hardforks before, without much fuss, and they are fine.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:19:05


That happen to be the same as in here, in this sub, if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:11:44
Segwit is not more efficient, transactions actually take more space.
And there are other solutions that allow LN and other second layer solutions. Like flexible transactions, just to give an example.


you're just saying that out of nowhere, just to make your point. Bitcoin was growing, with more adoption. it's delusional to think it was 'malicious'. People, including prominent developers were warning about it (blocks almost full) for years. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:29:36
No Lol. Yes, they helped the bitcoin protocol in the beginning and then they quit. Have you wondered why 400+ devs are not active anymore? Have you even read the letter from Mike Hearn? Do you have any clue whatsoever what are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:35:20
You are comparing water and petrol, with one orange and two oranges.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:49:03
Now we are in 400+ devs? Last time I checked it was 100+ .. growing fast!!
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:17:48
I'm sure those 400+ not active anymore all agree with segwit. /s
* 475 - total
* ~60 - active last 2 years
