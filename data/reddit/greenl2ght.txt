In the EU PayPal is regulated as an electronic money transmitter and they DO do the same thing - after £15,000 have passed through your account they are require an ID scan

You would have coins on both forks. But as soon as you make a transaction *after* the fork, god knows what chain it will be accepted on (depending on what other transactions are in the block, the size of the block, etc). Theoretically you might be able to spend the coins twice - once on each fork of the chain (but only if there's someone to accept a transaction on each fork without checking the other)

It's not in the miners rational self interest to actually include any transactions in the blocks they mine.
Someone else did the math but basically the delay in propagation is never outweighed by the transaction fees earned, and miners want to avoid being beaten by others and lose the reward.

So "be your own" bank is bullshit. We're going to be using PayPal for the rest of our lives.
And even if bitcoin was only limited to settling between banks - why would banks pay sky-high fees to settle on bitcoin instead of using something else (like fiat or previous metals)

Doing it on testnet would reveal how real miners behave (F2Pool) or issues in other live services (blockchain). A test in testnet would only reiterate how the planned ideal would look. Like testing in a lab on rats instead of humans.

The retail experience of internet here in Japan is already pretty good - as long as you don't live rurally, you're probably going to have 100 Mbps as your base speed, with options to upgrade to 1 or 2 Gbps. This cable is probably just to keep up those speeds to international destinations as well as domestic ones.

The article says they'll settle monthly, but that's still users*sites every month which is a massive amount of transactions

There's quite a bit of difference between having a few testnet nodes and having all the wallet and merchant software (much of it custom) updated

The langage management. Can't speak for anything else

If someone sends you a link to blockchain with the language string in it, it'll switch your cookie. [This link will make your blockchain.info danish]( This happens all the time on Reddit as people paste links. It's really shitty software design.

You do realize that the "slippery slope" is a *fallacy* rather than an argument, right?

[Apparently, yes](
