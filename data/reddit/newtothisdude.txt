It really irks me to see the top comment on the bitcoin thread is about someone investing 4 years ago and now making 1M and yet I'm not allowed to speculate.  That's a bullshit mentality.  I am just a worthy of getting something out of my investment.

Actually, you are the one that sounds entitled.  Really? Is this how you reply to people who are simply trying to get more information.  I'll have you know that I have taken risks and I'm quite successful because of it.  I'm simply questioning the ability of this currency to go up substantially in value to where it is worth my time.  You see, the only way that things really work is if there are win-win scenarios.  I wasn't into investing years ago because I was in school making something out of myself while you were sitting at home jerking off in your mom's basement.  As you stated, there's a high chance things won't pan out... and that applies to your nasty response.  
Now I'm off to make some money (and use that money to better the world around me).

I find this disturbing.  I'm asking about how to make 1M on a different thread and people are telling me to not speculate.  If bitcoin is going to be successful, then I need to get something out of it.  
I'm afraid that the ceiling is not going to be high enough for anyone to make another 1M (which I am expecting or I won't support with my investment).

This is a great response.  Thank you for your perspective.  I am much appreciative.

But is it too late?  Seriously, going from $6000 and up... it would have to get to $600,000 per bitcoin before any serious profit can be made at this point.  Seems unreasonable.

Sorry dude, but that's not reasonable thinking.  People are only going to act on things if they get something out of it.  That's just human nature.  I agree that this has a future as a currency, but I need to get a return if I am to help enable that to be possible.

I don't have 1M.  I want to get 1M.  I understand Bitcoin is meant to use as a currency, but if I'm going to by into this, I need to get something out of it.  It has to be a win-win scenario and I don't want this to take years to get a return on investment.
