No, my question was why you think he doesn't care about it.

Depends on the size of the network. I take that everyday compared to Bitcoin's monopolistic mining pools and scaling issues.

Why substandard?

"Digital Gold" tells the story, hard recommendation

Can I maybe use that to restore my lost wallet password? :D
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:48:36
The larger the better. And why shouldn't he care about decentralization?

Then use it seamlessly with MEW...

Another person who does not understand crypto. The ledger can "hold" as many coins as it supports. You can only install a few apps at a time, but that's something completely different. Your coins are not lost if you uninstall an app.

Then you did something severely wrong. I had everything setup in 30min.

The income tax is high though :)
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:53:15
So nothing changes basically as this is the case at the moment as well.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:45:41
Because you can buy so much stuff with bitcoin. I thought it is marketed as digital gold nowadays?

"Image upload too large, try a smaller image." This really should be fixed for receiving high quality documents. Furthermore, is there no IBAN for bank transfers?

Until now I am very happy with OKPay. Everything went fine.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:33:03
I like this 1 year thing. They removed this however in Austria :(
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:35:16
Damn, I want someone to do this for my country :)

Hmhm, interesting concept. However, I think 10% is too much. 5% is more realistic from my point of view. I still always have the feeling that it is somehow too late to invest into the thing as the price currently is again very high, and we already could see some nice bursts.

I am also looking for retreiving the data for further analyses. Like getting a csv file, or accessing it via API.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:19:44
SOunds interesting. Please, invite ;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:29:36
Same for me. Did SEPA as well on Thursday and its awful to not be able to use it by now.
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:53:58
Hope so as well...

The color in the candles does not necessarily mean that the price went up or down it refers to buy or sell orders being processed.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:32:27
I only had positive experience with OKPay until now, but currently my wire is stuck in air as well. Any idea of what I can do?
