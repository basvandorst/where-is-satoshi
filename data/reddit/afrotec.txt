Thanks for explaining; I just didn't notice the links because nothing happened when I clicked on them. Good to hear referrals are on the roadmap; any insight on the mechanics of how they'll actually work?

Yes, if you recover a seed that is currently already loaded into the wallet, you'll just have two places that you could send transactions from. They are the same 'account', basically.
One way to think about it is that the bitcoin itself isn't actually "in" your wallet or your address. The funds themselves remain "in the network" at all times, and your private key is the way in which you can interact with the network to take action on the tokens which are associated with that key. The wallet is basically just a window to the blockchain.

After getting a transaction stuck, any transaction I care about gets full fees. Seems silly to worry about the funds being stuck in limbo over a difference of $5 transaction fee. But to each their own
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:54:59
Yeah, I agree. Seems like the wallet is resending the tx, so maybe it would be good to back up the seed and then uninstall the app from the phone.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:38:28
I see what you are saying, but wanted to point out that SegWit does allow for lower fees, but it's not through a "discount"; the fees are reduced because the actual transaction size is smaller. There is no way to enforce a transaction "discount", it's up to the miners to include the transactions they select. There is no predetermined transaction fee, they can select zero-fee transactions if they want to, but they would be missing out on the transaction fees of the high-fee transactions. Segwit just allows the transaction size to be reduced, so you are still paying the going rate of sat/B, but the total bytes of your transaction have been reduced. Hope that makes sense
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:25:13
Time estimates are not accurate in my experience. If you want the transaction confirmed, it's best to pay the rate that most transactions are being confirmed at. Seems that's around 400 sat/B for confirmation in the next several blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:44:07
Yes, simple rebuttal: money is not backed by gold. As far as I know, no countries are using a gold-backed fiat currency. Money being backed by gold is a common fallacy.
To actually prove your point, you will need to educate your friend on what a fiat currency is, and demonstrate that by definition, fiat currencies are not "backed" by any physical commodity. Money is only useful because the government enforces their use and accepts them as a payment for debt.

Is there something in place that would allow users to view the selected item in the OB client? For instance, if I find something I'd like to purchase using DuoSearch, how can I pull up that same item on OB?
Also, more generally, it would be really interesting to implement a sort of referral commission system, where DuoSearch or other OB search engines would receive a small commission from the sale of the item, with the commission coming directly from the merchant, instead of from the company, like in Amazon's referral system.

1. check here, there are faster methods: 
2. bitcoin price is basically the lowest price that another person is willing to exchange btc for something else at that moment. The markets are all separate, but tend to track closely. When the spread between markets increases, it creates an arbitrage opportunity to those who have access to capital in the right places, which eventually reduces the spread. It might be $15,424 on GDAX and $15,388 on BitFinex, etc. It just depends on the markets.
3. Please do not invest more than you can afford to loose. Fees you should be looking for are exchange fees and network fees. Exchange fees go to the exchange (Coinbase, Gemeni, etc.) and network fees is the cost of doing a transaction on the bitcoin network. It's currently fairly expensive to move money around on the blockchain, so expect to pay $10-30 at current moment to move bitcoin from one address to another. There are other crypto coins that have lower fees, faster transaction times, etc. You'll have to do your own research there.
4. Yes, buying and selling on coinbase will incur fees. If you will be trading (daytrading = gambling), you can use GDAX (Coinbases's exchange platform) to reduce your fees and set limit orders, and use other trading tools. Coinbase is really for quick buys and sells, and is more expensive to use compared to the GDAX exchange. Yes, you can make money by selling high and buying low, but this is basically just gambling and it's much cheaper and easier to just play roulette. Or just regular stocks and crap on traditional markets if that's your thing.
5. different services handle things differently, but in general, not every movement of money within the platform will yield a bitcoin transaction. Usually, the services moves funds around off-chain (external to the bitcoin network, using their own databases), and will only use bitcoin transactions when necessary (when removing funds from the platform). I believe coinbase does assign each user a specific wallet, so every time you buy USD, i believe they are sending btc to that address using an on-chain transaction. I could be wrong though.

I would probably break it up into smaller transfers. Not sure about the banking side of things, but for the exchange, I would be using a reputable service like Gemini, who are used to dealing with large amounts. I would not consider using coinbase.
If you want to avoid the nightmare of having money lost or frozen, you better just keep the money in btc ;)
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:22:50
Good on you for thinking things through and testing. I think cheapest/fastest would be using LTC to transfer from Binance to GDAX, where I think you can withdraw with low/minimal fees. LTC will allow you to do the actual transfer faster, and with less network fees.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:01:43
I would really not trust my money in any crypto besides btc. Especially for long term storage. Either bitcoin or cashout to fiat

Ah right, I thought he was asking about just trading cryptos. You are correct - no fiat on Binance.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:30:30
Bitcoin fees are prohibitively high for low-value transactions like this. If you're just wanting to play around with some crypto, have him send your some LTC instead. I think changelly will allow credit card for crypto purchases, but I might be wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:19:32
Nope. Crypto to Crypto exchanges only. USDT is the closest to fiat you can trade. So you will need to exchange usd for btc elsewhere and send it to Binance.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:08:42
No fee if the transaction does not get picked up by a miner.

On PC you just click Buy/Sell, select Bitcoin, then under Payment Method you select USD Wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:35:03
Which software are you using? Seems it might be out of date, because these days we are using around 200-500 sat/b to get transactions confirmed in a timely manner. Currently, you are behind 20k+ transactions that used a fee greater than 50 sat/B, so I'm not sure if your transaction will get picked up ever. If not, it should drop from the mempool after a couple weeks, as long as a wallet is not automatically rebroadcasting it.
see here for info on how much fees to pay:
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:26:39
Here's a method that hasn't been mentioned yet...
Instead of the typical method of using an exchange to cash out to usd, then transferring to a bank and paying thousands in capital gains, you could take out a collateralized loan using the btc as a backing. Salt Lending is a new company that is allowing people to take out usd loans using their btc as collateral, which allows you to bypass capital gains tax, and you maintain ownership of the btc so if it goes to $20k, you can sell it and pay off the loan if you wanted to.
This method is definitely more complicated and would take much longer to apply for the loan (although there is no credit check). But being able to still hold your coins plus not being on the hook for cap gains is a very interesting opportunity. There are additional perks available within their system, but I'll save that for later to keep this comment from being too much of a sales pitch. Just something cool I stumbled on recently.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:29:52
Which wallet? Some wallets keep broadcasting failed transactions in hope of getting them picked up. This is a suuuper low fee tx, so there is basically no hope of it getting confirmed just by chance or mempool reduction.
It should fall off within a couple of weeks in my experience, but that seems to not be the case here. You could also consider using a tx accelerator service to get the transaction confirmed but it will cost $30, so not sure if it is worth the expense.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:55:10
This is true. You won't need to have a channel with everybody you want to transact with. There only needs to exist a route between existing channels that would allow you to transmit a transaction to the person via the network.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:33:50
Nope, should be fine. It should drop from the mempool in a few wks. Until then, it will still be unconfirmed in any wallet you use to view the tx
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:16:13
Yes, but also be aware that there are withdraw limits for unverified users.
Binance is often recommended, since it will allow up to 2 BTC withdraws for unverified accounts.

Sorry, but you will not be able to move those funds due to high fees on the bitcoin network. It currently costs $10-30 to send a transaction, so you'll need to hang on to these coins until the fees drop eventually, or until the price increases enough to cover the transaction fee.

Except your proposal is not logical.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:03:56
Yes. You will owe sales tax on the transaction (if applicable in your state), as well as capital gains tax on the amount of value realized in the transaction. The value realized is the difference in the value of the bitcoin at time of initial purchase and the current value of that amount of btc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:16:40
The idea is that there would be a vast network of payment channels between people, exchanges, businesses, etc. If the network were sufficiently large, you should be able to send funds to another person via the network, even though you dont have a direct channel. Think 6 degrees of separation. If you and i would like to transact, it's likely we might have a common link between us that would allow the transaction to propagate through the network. So maybe you have a channel open with coinbase and I don't use coinbase, but I have a friend that does and I have an open channel with him. So I will send a transaction to you which will go from my friend, to coinbase, to you, via our existing payment channels.
as far as the off-chain transactions, yes they do not exist on chain until the channel is closed. from my understanding, you still "own" the coins as the transaction is cryptographically signed and valid, but you are just waiting for it to hit the network.
Although my example above is probably not the greatest, since coinbase would probably take forever to actually implement LN (maybe even actively oppose it), since it competes with their business model and based on their segwit implementation excuses.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:09:21
Idk, 70 Bits for $1 seems like a solid deal.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:09:40
So there are several taxes you'll need to be aware of:
Sales tax - possibly applied automatically by the retailer. If not, and your state charges sales tax, you are supposed to add this to your yearly tax filing.
capital gainz - you will be liable for capital gains taxes on the appreciated value of your bitcoin. If you bought btc for 10k and it's now 15k, and you buy a $15k TV paid in bitcoin, you will owe the sales tax above as well as an additional tax on the appreciated value, which is $5K in this example. The capital gains rate depends on your overall income, it can be 0%, 15% or 20% depending on how much income you made during the applicable tax year.

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:44:19
Yes, there are many that fit this criteria. However, the best answer will really depend on if you will be holding the currency, and what you would like to do with it after sending/receiving it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:53:39
I would not take the time estimate with much confidence. The mempool has been pretty congested and hasn't been able to clear the lower-fee transactions like it normally might (with the exception of around 12/25).
If the client is not continually rebroadcasting, then you should be able to wait until it drops off after around 2wks. You could consider accelerating the transaction as I've mentioned, but that will cost $30.
Sucks you missed out on some gains, but at least you're stuck holding BTC and not USD...
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:16:52
Agreed, but I would still not have the first idea of how to use gold or accept it as currency without verifying it's authenticity. widespread electrical disaster is plausible, but it is already possible to broadcast a btc transaction via radio waves
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:12:00
It's possible that the blockchain.info wallet client is continuing to broadcast the transaction, which could cause it to not be dropped after the standard amount of time. If it is a significantly important transaction you could consider accelerating the transaction, which I've covered in some previous posts of mine.
You could also consider creating a custom transaction with high fee that spends the same outputs to another address under your ownership.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:02:18
Are you sure it was a bitcoin address and not bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:24:56
You need to include the value at which the bitcoin was originally acquired. Say you bought bitcoin at 500 and it's now worth $14k. Your graphics card cost 700, or .05btc. To acquire that .05btc, it originally cost you $25 (.05btc x $500) and it's now worth 700. So you would need to pay capital gains tax on your $675 gain.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:36:11
You are attempting to compare two different measures. Transaction time is the length of time it takes for an *individual* transaction to be confirmed by the network. **Block time** is the length of time in between blocks of transactions, which is not necessarily equal to transaction time. Space inside each block is a finite resource, so every pending transaction is not necessarily included in the next block. There are currently over 100k+ transactions in the mempool (aka pending), but each block includes only around 1000-2000 transactions.
If you are new, it's important to note that the transaction times in bitcoin are a very prevalent issue at the moment. It is currently fairly expensive to submit a bitcoin transaction, and may take a substantial amount of time to be confirmed in a block.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:20:02
First step in any data recovery is to take a full disk image of the drive. Provided that it is not damaged and can be operated without failure. So if you care about your btc, you should do that step first. Use the dd tool in linux. If this is a significant amount of btc, i would even consider a second copy.
After that, I would use the testdisk software to attempt recovery using some of the included tools and documentation that is available online.

Ah okay, well he could at least probably claim to have held those original coins. But as far as the gains he's made I am really not sure. Honestly, it may be best to just keep them in btc.

You could share the transaction hash to allow us some more detail on what might be going on. (possible privacy risk of divulging your public btc address, allowing people to link that to your reddit identity in the future)
It is likely transaction fee or spending of unconfirmed outputs. Here is a comment I made to another user in a similar situation:

The mempool was clearing out a bit thanks to low tx volume over the christmas holiday. Seems to have built back up a bit since then. They are lower than they were a week ago, but still need probably 600+ sat/B to get something through in a reasonable time frame.
There may be some options for getting the low-fee transaction confirmed.

I would not recommend using PayPal. If using LocalBitcoins, your best bet is to purchase a small amount from a local, well reviewed seller. After several small purchases to test their reliability, then you could proceed with a larger order with relative confidence. All precautions that apply to any other in-person transaction should apply here. Meet in a populated area, bring a friend, have a sniper on a nearby building, etc.

Thanks, I was actually looking for answers. Not just concern-trolling gold bugs :D
Surely there are techniques to verify gold, but in the event of an unplanned disaster, there would certainly be quite a learning curve for most people. 
I saw an interesting video from ~~Adam Kokesh~~ *actually Mark Dice* (can't find the link at the moment) which really solidifed my position on gold. He is standing literally outside of a jewelry store, and is offering people on the street to buy a gold coin for $10. The coin is real and worth $250, but literally nobody is willing to pay $10 for it and take it to the jewelry store to verify. Pretty indicative, in my opinion.

Just wait the 4 days, it's not that bad really. Can't you do some more verification to increase the limits on Conbase? Localbitcoins is always an options as well. I think Changelly takes credit/debit, but don't take my word on that.
Also, consider the reason why many people are not willing to accept visa/mastercard (an easily revocable form of payment) for bitcoin (mathematically irrevocable). With every sale, they are taking a risk that the customer will not file a chargeback on the credit card, which leaves the exchange at a loss of the bitcoin as well as the card payment. Hard to blame them, honestly.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:58:58
I agree with your frustration. Consider that the current high fees are a result of limited block space. This creates upward pressure on the tx fee, since everyone who cares about getting their transaction confirmed wants to be on the "top of the pile" and will pay more than previous transactions in order to increase the liklihood of their tx getting confirmed.
segwit will reduce the overall size of the transactions. lightning network will help reduce the overall quantity of on-chain transactions. In combination, this should reduce the upward fee pressure we are seeing today. Segwit adoption is currently only around 10% unfortunately, and has never been over 18%. So we have a ways to go in that regard.

Bitcoin is an entirely new asset-class. The volatility we are currently observing is merely price discovery in a substantially free market. Things are mostly working as they should in this regard. There exist instruments to limit your exposure to the volatility, and this will likely not be as much of an issue as society establishes how much 1 btc is actually worth.
Bitcoin operates in what is basically a free market. There are no regulations to prohibit wealthy individuals from manipulating the market. This is merely a result of the relatively low number of people using bitcoin. If there were billions of bitcoin holders, the price would not be as easily influenced. This is something we just need to deal with as a consequence of unregulated markets. People are likely to not accept the answer that manipulation is just something you deal with in a free market, but it's the truth. People are used to their governments controlling and vetting everything for them. Once you tell them that they are free to make those decisions for themselves, they quickly become scared.

Yep, annoying at the moment but I think the widespread frustration will eventfully lead to a solution.
best thing for you to do would be to find the tx hash (if kucoin provided this info) and pull up the transaction on blockchain.info and determine if the transaction has spent unconfirmed outputs. if so, you will need to open the preceding transaction and see if that one has spend unconfirmed outputs. Keep going back until you find a tx that is unconfirmed, but has spend confirmed outputs. It will likely use very low fee, and this is the TX you are waiting to be confirmed. Once you determine that (if that happens to be your case), you can pay $30 to use a transaction accelerator service which should cause all the other transactions to come through. pm if you need help with this, or need more info. happy to help if possible.

Sorry bud. Bitcoin is currently in the midst of some...growing pains. It is not economical to use btc as a day-to-day transactional currency at present moment. The network fees are very high due to congestion, so it is costly to send any transaction, no matter the amount.

Edit: it goes back a couple of transactions. The stuck transaction is this one, which has a fee of only 10 sat/B: 16245bb9e3188e4df50e4964478fbdd9cf2d4ef115efcd3ea6424e04b415b942
This EXACT same thing happened to me when doing a changelly transfer. Their transaction included an unconfirmed output, so I had to go back a couple of transactions in the chain and figure out which one was causing it. Once I determined which one it was, I used a paid transaction accelerator service, found here:  Telegram group is the fastest method. I paid $30 and the problem transaction was picked up in the very next block. The two remaining transactions were picked up in the block right after. Funds came through in ~30min.
Good luck. Let me know if you have questions.

See my comments here and let me know if you have any questions. Same thing happened to me. You need to use a paid transaction accelerator service ($30) to get the low-fee transaction picked up. The following transactions should come through soon after, if not in the very same block.

If it was true, you would be able to import your btc address from your hardware wallet into a 2x wallet and then spend the coins. But i would not trust any 2xwallet application with my private seed. best to transfer all btc out of that address first.

It's important to distinguish between the bitcoin network fees, and the fees charged by the person who owns the atm.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:29:55
I have used both and prefer Trezor. Slush and Stick (the creators) have been in the community forever and have provided extraordinary value to bitcoin users over the years. Ledger is also good though. If price is really a concern, consider their HW.1 wallet, which offers most of the same benefits, but is way cheaper because it does not have a screen or buttons. Not sure if that is still available.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:34:11
They are a voluntary service provider. You are not being forced to use their service. Viable alternatives exist, please use those instead if you are unhappy with Conbase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:22:23
Hm, I'm not sure if Replace By Fee would work, perhaps if you have a wallet that allows it or if you can create the transaction from scratch using something like coinb.in it might be worth a shot. Although I think it is probably easier to use the Telegram group I linked to. The person running the support was super helpful and I trust him (though I have only used the service once). It is worth the $30 if you care about this transaction.
When this happened to me, I was also waiting on 2 levels of transactions. I paid for the first low-fee one to be confirmed, and the others seemed to be pulled in with it or immediately after. The first was maybe 30 sat/B, second transaction was ~300 sat/B and my third was around ~400 sat/B. So if you use an accelerator service, just pay for that one low fee one, wait a few blocks and see if the others come through. 
If you remember, please let me know what happens with this transaction. I am interested and would like to use our experience to help others when they run into similar issues.

Hm, interesting. The origin of the funds will definitely come into questions. He will need something to show how he may have acquired them legitimately. Has he used an exchange or anything around that time?

Of course it 'recognizes' it as a bitcoin address, because bitcoin and bch addresses are indistinguishable. 
Are you using iphone or android??
Here are the possibilities as far as I can tell:   
1. malware on your phone changed the bitcoin address you copied to your clipboard   
2. you mistakenly copied your bch receive address and send btc to it   
3. the address didn't copy correctly and you pasted a bitcoin address that you had previously copied.

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:47:06
Yes, you'll need a wallet. For an in-person transfer, you should be all set with wallet and receiving address. Send with super high fees and be prepared to wait for at least 1 confirmation (maybe more depending on the transaction amount, but 1 or 2 is probably fine).
There are network fees whenever you transfer btc from one address to another. They are currently very high, so keep this in mind, especially if you are conduction transactions under $100, as fees can be anywhere from $10-30 depending on the size of the transaction.

Best suggestion I can give is to actually just read those books which you already have. Too many people, myself included, get sidetracked in the acquisition of books, media, etc. rather than actually reading and understanding that which they already have access to.

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:10:17
Bitcoin is pseudonymous. Your bitcoin address alone can not be linked to your identity. However, it is possible to trace transactions in the blockchain. If you have somehow linked an address to an identity (posted transaction on reddit, for example), people can trace transactions from known entities into your address. So if you post on reddit and include your wallet address, i can see your previous transactions for that address. Since many exchanges and services have addresses which are publically known, one could determine that you've received coins from an exchange in the past, and sent those coins to a gambling site, for instance. 
Sending btc amongst different unknown addresses on the blockchain won't necessarily divulge your identity, but attempting to withdraw from an exchange or another service which collects personal information can allow the law enforcement authorities of your country to obtain that information through legal channels and effectively trace you.
Think if it like reddit, which is also pseudonymous. Nobody really knows who plague_doctor8 is, unless you post some identifiable information using this account. Reddit (similar to an exchange mentioned above) probably has your IP address, so if the authorities make a valid request, they will provide the information which may reveal your true identity.

You have several options. Depending on the wallet used, and who is receiving the outputs, Child Pays For Parent, or Replace By Fee may be options for you. Not incredibly difficult, but not easy if you are not familiar with some more technical aspects of btc.
Your best and easiest option would be to pay somebody to 'accelerate' your transactions. These are users with connections to mining pools that are able to select transactions for inclusion in upcoming blocks. 
See this thread: 
Join the Telegram group and the support person will help get your transaction confirmed. Cost me $30, but my stuck transactions came through in the next block. Worth every satoshi, although not the most viable options for low-value transactions.

You could share the transaction hash to allow us some more detail on what might be going on. (possible privacy risk of divulging your public btc address, allowing people to link that to your reddit identity in the future)
It is likely transaction fee or spending of unconfirmed outputs. Here is a comment I made to another user in a similar situation:

Is BTH bcash? If you are looking for fast transactions I would probably use a different crypto, since bcash is associated with some questionable actors, and more importantly, it uses the same addresses as bitcoin so it's pretty easy to accidentally send btc to a bcash address and vice versa. I guess it depends on your use-case
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:29:04
Depends on the service and how the coins are actually mixed. Some are more anonymous than others. Maybe some are good enough, but it really depends who you are hiding from.

Yes, see my edits above. The paid service I linked worked for me in a very similar situation. If you pay to have that first low-fee transaction confirmed, it should go through and then the other two should follow shortly after.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:43:13
640 sat/B should get through with no trouble, looking at the current stats. Maybe there is something else holding up the transaction (for example, maybe your transaction spends unconfirmed outputs from another transaction with very low fee). Consider posting the hash of the tx if you are okay with the slight privacy concern of other users linking the address to your reddit username.

If you are planning to "buy low and wait until the coin has higher value before moving to a hardware wallet", there is a good chance you will get burned. Exchanges get hacked, accounts get hacked. Every moment you leave money on exchange is increasing the likelihood that you will loose that money. Whether or not you are okay with that risk is up to you to determine. Also note, holding btc in your own wallet is also not without risks. it's important to backup your keys in multiple places

I understand that part, but the difficulties I mention remain. Even moreso in a society experiencing a collapse of central goverment. How will anybody be able to confirm that my coins are real? And how do I buy toilet paper with a 1oz gold coin worth over $1k?

Gold is incredibly confusing to me. You have to go somewhere in person to sell it. How do you know it's real? How can you divide it? How do you measure and value it (oz/g/kg, troy oz, etc.)? The whole thing is just very daunting and archaic. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:31:50
I totally agree. But it is much easier to trumpet "
Taxation is Theft" when you do not have much money to be taxed on. I suspect some people here, now that they have realized some gains through btc, are far less interested in maintaining their ideals when faced with the real consequence of loosing their freedom.

You would be worth billions if you bought Google stock day 1, or Microsoft, or Facebook, or any successful company. The fact that these assets have experienced wild growth should not alone persuade you to invest your money in them today.
Could you afford to loose the $200? Is there anything else you could be using the $200 for (seeflowchart for how to allocate money: 
If you can afford to loose the money and your other bases are covered, then go ahead and invest. However, if you are merely chasing dem crazy gainz, be aware that while there is huge potential for growth in bitcoin, a "mere" 100% increase would mean doubling the market cap to over $500 billion, which doesn't exactly happen overnight.

Back up those seeds
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:03:18
The high fees we are currently experiencing are a result of network congestion crowding out space in the blocks, partially resulting from inadequate segwit adoption. As a result, the only way to get a tx confirmed is to submit it with a high fee in comparison to the other transactions that are waiting to be confirmed. This causes an upward pressure on the fee rate (sat/B), since people who want their transactions confirmed are willing to pay higher and higher fees.
So LN will help alleviate some of that pressure by allowing a larger portion of transactions to occur off-chain within the payment channels, instead of every transaction being on-chain. So there will be fees with each on-chain transaction (opening and closing the channel) but they will be cheaper than they are currently, and you will pay them less often.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:52:46
It is a bandaid in a way. But if everyone adopts it, a significant impact will be made on the fees. It's probably not the ultimate solution, but we would be foolish to push through a blocksize increase without first attempting other, less-drastic, measures.
On Lightning, you need to do some more research (I do too, honestly). The off-chain tx's can be validated without being pushed to the blockchain. As far as I understand it, the payment channels are 1to1, so if we open a channel between eachother, we both have agreed to lock some btc and can then send transactions between eachother off chain. Each transaction builds upon the previous one, so there's no need to validate the transaction on the chain, since if the signatures and hashes are valid, it will be a valid tx. Either user can close the channel at any time by pushing the latest transaction onto the blockchain, which will settle the payments and close the channel.
More eloquently explained here:

Thank you for pointing that out, I wasn't aware of that. Are Adblock and Adblock plus related at least? What's the difference?
Edit: They are not related. I found the following breakdown helpful, though perhaps a bit one-sided [(source)](


2. Adblock Plus is the original extension created by Wladimir Palant for firefox.
3. Adblock came into picture as a popular extension with similar capacities for chrome.
4. Adblock is no longer open source. And behaves maliciously when it comes to identity protection and privacy.
5. My advice chuck out Adblock if you have it, get Adblock Plus and support free content creators by allowing non-intrusive ads.
Furthermore, going to the AdBlock page you linked, I don't like that they have "Pay With: Credit Card, PayPal" and then "other..." in small grey text, so you have to actually click on other to see additional payment methods...which consists of only bitcoin anyways. So what's the point of hiding it behind a link like that? Based that and the other stuff I've read about AdBlock, I won't be using my bitcoins to support this guy. Not to mention all the bold text saying "**Pay what you can afford**. Are we **naive** for *trusting you to pay?*" but really they won't accept payments of less than $5 anyways. Very deceiving, Michael.
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:36:21

Actual physical coins that try to integrate bitcoin (QR codes, private keys, etc) are not only risky, they are misleading. It's already fairly difficult for a person to grasp the concept of bitcoin existing purely in the digital realm, when they see a physical bitcoin that's actually supposed to represent real, digital, bitcoin, it just introduces another level of complexity and probably 10 more minutes of explaining to them how it really works. Not to mention that by physically tokenizing bitcoin, you are missing out on several of its inherant benefits. If you want to carry around coins, buy gold/silver/whatever.

You have a point, though I think part of the issue is due to the fact that the legacy electronic payments model is mostly a system of middle men, who each contribute something to the process of settling payment between two individuals. You have the bank who holds the funds, then card companies like Visa and Mastercard that provide the networks, then the company the provides the terminal or payment gateway, then you have something like ApplePay that takes an additional cut of the transaction. Contrast that convoluted, parasitic, system with a peer-to-peer solution that removes all unnecessary third parties from the system, and it's easy to see why a bitcoin-only world might seem desirable for some.

Sorry for your loss, Tom. While I'm not certain, it definitely seems like your account could have been compromised during the critical step of inputting the private key into a potentially-unsafe machine; either being grabbed immediately after entry by keylogger, or after the electrum wallet creation via some malware that scans for unencrypted wallet files.
To avoid a similar instance in the future, you should **never** enter private keys directly into a potentially-compromised machine. To maintain a high level of security, it is often best to assume a machine has been compromised in some way, unless proven otherwise, or unless adequate steps have been taken to prevent such an occurrence.
For future transactions, you would be wise to consider the use of a hardware wallet, which could be used to safely conduct transactions from a potentially-compromised machine. Additionally, you could have also created an unsigned transaction on the compromised machine, transferred it via USB to a clean linux machine booted from live-cd, enter the private key into the linux machine, and then sign the transaction and transfer back to the original machine to be pushed to the blockchain. I think the use of hardware wallet is much easier, and also more secure, since you will *never* need to actually type the private key, which protects you from additional attack vectors like video surveillance.
Also, a multi-signature wallet could have helped with this incident by requiring additional signatures for the transaction to be valid (maybe from mobile device, offline machine, hardware wallet, Mom's bitcoin address, etc.)
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:52:02
Same thing happened to me. Here's what you need to do: create an Amazon wishlist according to Purse.io's instructions (enter shipping address, make public, etc.) then add the item you want into the wishlist.

Watch some talks by Andreas, he's a great speaker and you can learn a lot from his discussions. Here's a great playlist of 51 of his videos: 
My favorite ones by him are the "Ask Me Hard Questions About Bitcoin" a 3 part series, found here: 
I'm also really fond of all the great videos done by on his [youtube channel]( He has a couple recent animations that cover introductory bitcoin topics ([Bitcoin for the Intelligent Layperson Pt.1]( and [How Bitcoin Can Stop War]( but some of his older animations that help explain different aspects of liberitarian political philosophy are incredibly well done. While they do not directly discuss bitcoin, I think some of the ideas he presents go hand in hand with bitcoin, and really help you view the world from a slightly different perspective. [George Ought to Help]( [You Can Always Leave]( and [Edgar the Exploiter]( are the three that come to mind. All of his videos are really great though, you should watch them.

Couldn't think of a good joke, but try tipping in greater amounts. $1 works well enough on reddit, but I would recommend choosing one or two people you *really* want to tip, and giving them $5-10 or even more if you can. You have to pique their interest, and make it worth their while to collect.
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:28:26
1: At this point, mining bitcoin requires specialized computer hardware. Acquiring a significant amount of these purpose-built machines can be expensive and costly to power, and is not a worthwhile investment for most users.
2: Tips are sent using the changetip bot, and are used to show appreciation for a post, or just to be generous. Tipping is just one example of how easy sending bitcoin can be. Try it out, its contagious :)
3: Yes, it is very easy to sell btc. There are many exchanges, services, and people that are willing to trade your btc for their usd if you would rather hold dollars. Please be mindful that you should not invest any amount that you could not afford to loose. There are risks associated with bitcoin, just as there are with any other financial instrument or currency, and you should remain mindful of those risks at all times. It's very important to practice good security procedures, and to always make sure to use secure, unique passwords, and two factor authentication wherever possible.

You should look at a hardware wallet. Using a hardware wallet allows you additional security of your funds, along with some added convenience over typical cold storage methods.

I don't understand why population growth has any influence of the valuation of bitcoin. Perhaps if each newly created person was endowed with 1btc, but that's certainly not the case. The per capita figure isn't a valid measure of btc value, since by nature it is an average across the entire population (including those who do not use bitcoin), and not an average among those who actually own bitcoin. 21mil people does not equal 21mil bitcoin users.

Back in the earlier days of ASICMiner, when I had just gotten into bitcoin, I purchased a few shares with my coins, because...fuck it, why not? After a few months of not paying attention to the bitcoin world, I remembered about my shares, checked their value, and they had skyrocketed! While I only had a few shares, I'd probably amassed over 10btc from my initial ~2-3btc investment.
After holding the shares for a few more weeks, I decided I should diversify. Shouldn't keep all your eggs in one basket, right? I then divested a majority of my AM shares into small holdings in several different bitcoin mining operation startups. Over the course of the next few months, my portfolio of bitcoin securities would balloon up to almost 30btc! That is, of course, until it turned out that all the companies I invested in were scams, and their shares eventually became worthless. At that point, I was left with merely 6,000 worthless and untradeable shares in a defunct mining operation, and 0 BTC.
And that, kids, is why you shouldn't try to invest your bicoin. Just hodl that shit.

Little confused: so you split the 99-digit number(used to generate private key) into 3 different 33-digit parts, then distributed those?
If I understand correctly, you're using a manual type of M-of-N backup. The theory is sound, as long as you trust the individuals not to collude against you.
Also check out the Armory wallet client, it provides an automated M-of-N functionality, similar to the method you've described. An added advantage of the Armory client is that it can use deterministic fragmentation, so fragments can be reprinted, or number of fragments increased at a later time.

First off, this is a really cool idea. It could be pretty awesome if it all works. The mods over there are doing a fine job gathering input from the community, and trying to be transparent about all aspects. That said, I don't think this is being executed as properly as it should be. There are several issues of concern, namely the method in which the winner is selected (provable randomness), and the method by which donations are submitted or collected (before or after winner selection).
The selection of the winner needs to be provably random, such that any member of the community can be certain (and test for themselves) that the random number was derived through an unpredictable means. Picking a random number using some website over livestream is not provably random, nor verifiable.
Regarding donations, I've stated several times previously that a multi-signature bitcoin address is by far the best and most transparent way to collect the funds prior to donation. If funds are not collected prior, many people will not follow through on their commitment to donate if the person selected does not meet their personal criteria; which will turn this from making a random person a millionaire, into raising few bucks that ultimately buys not much more than an above-average sub sandwich.
I don't want to come off as cynical about this whole ordeal; quite the opposite, I want to see this turn into a thing that we can look back and be proud of one day. But in order for that to happen, and for this to scale up from 2,500 subscribers, it's important that we determine the best and safest method.

Same way it works now basically (except with less mental conversions between currencies): the market sets the price. If somebody out there in the market is willing to trade 1oz of gold for 1BTC, then that's the exchange rate. If others are willing to accept less btc for 1oz of gold, then the exchange rate becomes lower. If people begin to demand 1.5btc per oz, then the exchange rate has increased.

I was thinking the same thing you were about a year ago. If I would have jumped when I initially wanted to,  I would be in a different position today. And I'd have a few more bitcoins.
*You should only jump if you're ready. Have you read the whitepaper? Do you know of the different ways of storing, and spending, and using your coins? Do you know how to secure your wallet, and encrypt your paper wallets? Using bitcoin is a pretty drastic leap for most people, technologically speaking. You should be sure you're up to speed on all the necessary topics before you become substantially involved. That said, there's nothing wrong with throwing in $5 just to play around with stuff to become more familiar with the concepts before you think about dropping in $5k.
All that aside, don't start buying bitcoin just because you think it's going to make you rich quick. Those people are usually the first to get burned. See if you don't believe me.

It's just another shit-coin. From their bitcointalk page:


Apparently they want to make it the 'asian dogecoin'


The reason why we feel emulating the success of Doge is so important is that the Asian markets were not readily available to Doge upon release. The main differences here is that WE are putting in the leg work to form partnerships in the Asian territories, gain traction on the Asian exchanges and push the coin to a very crypto-savy community.

Aha, that's why I first asked if you were hypothesizing that there were no other governmental currencies in existence.

Perhaps if one's investment strategy is to buy a small amount of BTC only one time, then hodl indefinitely. But personally I prefer a more robust solution that allows one to spend when they want to, with the same level of security (or better) as typical cold storage.
Not to mention the other features it provides, such as multiple passphrases to allow for plausible deniability. Or the fact that you can make transactions from a keylogged (or otherwise compromised) computer without putting your BTC in jeopardy.
I don't want to come off like I'm advertising the damn thing...but the device offers better security and is easier to use method of security than any other currently-existing solution.

Sure, they lost money, and some will probably not involve themselves with BTC again, but others will certainly be back. People like Erik Voorhees, who spoke publicly about loosing a large quantity of bitcoin in the Gox fiasco. Many of these people believe in bitcoin and will likely reinvest at some point if they haven't already.
Additionally, many of these people likely had btc stashed elsewhere, so while they may have taken huge losses, they still own *some* coin *somewhere*. Which is a lot more than the vast majority of people can say.

I just use whatever printer I have access to. Using BIP0038 you can encrypt the paper wallet's private key using a password. If anybody were to somehow recover the printed image from the printer, they would need the additional password in order to access the stored funds.
As long as the keys are generated in a secure way, then you will be safe. (offline computer, secure OS on live CD, you know the drill)

It shouldn't be discouraged at all. Really, it's all about context. If someone is interested in bitcoin and you tip them  100 bits, that small amount is all that's really needed for them to get their feet wet.
In comparison, if I tip somone 100 bits for a helpful answer, that might be nice if they have a changetip account setup already, but otherwise, you're asking them to take a few steps in order for them to claim their reward of a few pennies that they wont even be able to spend unless they already had some bitcoin somewhere. While the gesture is certainly of good nature, some may consider it petty, and at times can come across as more of an advertisement for bitcoin instead of the intended friendly gesture.
For this reason, I try to tip meaningful amounts, at least 1 USD. It's also helpful to attach the value to something physical. So if someone really helps me out, I can buy them a beer for example, which I feel translates well to real life. Using changetip, all I'd have to say is '1 Beer' or whatever other custom item/amount I choose to set
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:43:03
Nope. CurrentC basically uses QR codes to initiate ACH bank transfers. Basically the point of it is to provide customers some increased convenience and 'security' like ApplePay, but allow retailers to avoid paying a percentage of the transaction as a fee to the payment processing companies. Thus the ACH bank transfer. However, many ApplePay customers are claiming that by using ACH transfers, CurrentC may leave them vulnerable for identity theft through their bank accounts; an arguably more inconvenient situation than the theft of a credit card.
Regarding bitcoin, I think CurrentC's transaction initiation mechanism (QR codes) is incredibly congruent with how we use bitcoin today. At it's worst, it primes people on what a QR code is, and how it can be used to facilitate payments. At best, they may find a way to integrate a bitcoin payment option within the application itself, which would basically make it a bitcoin wallet with the additional option to use ACH bank transfer instead.

Probably only several percent discount for cash, like 2% and a greater discount for bitcoin or cryptocurrency payments. Though the exact percentages will depend on the specific company's margins and how much they can gain by eliminating or reducing credit card payments. Some industries would be able to offer a much more substantial discount, since they're currently getting reamed by credit card companies (like gas stations)

I'm sure people have. If you're counting mnemonics and not just memorizing the raw pub/priv keys, brainwallets can be easily memorized and can provide adequate security provided they're generated correctly.

One reason for an organizations to hold btc donations in their raw form instead of immediately coverting into a government-backed currency is simply because they believe in bitcoin. Bitcoin offers increased security and autonomy of one's wealth, so it's no surprise that the pirate party is choosing to leave their assets as btc. Leaving their money in the bank could expose them to financial risk from the ruling party, or from other controlling interests that would enjoy inconveniencing the pirate party. Bitcoin shields them from most of these risks.
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:59:34
Certainly :)
If you weren't willing to completely loose your 5 BTC then your decision is commendable. However, I can't agree with your negative sentiment about companies dumping BTCs. There's simply not enough merchants in the retail supply chain who accept bitcoin yet. When there are, then these companies won't have to sell BTC to get dollars to exchange for stuff; they can skip the dollars and go right from BTC to stuff. Much easier this way anyways

You can create your own using the Tasker and Zooper Widget apps. I'll give you a rough step by step of how I did it. The steps in tasker are as follows:
1. Begin by creating a new "Task", name it BTC widget or whatever you'd like.
2. Now you'll need to add actions to your task. First you should add a "HTTP Get" option, to query your chosen website's API.
3. In the "Server:port" box, enter the string to the data you want, mine is: 
4. "Mime Type" autofilled itself for me, to read: application/octet-stream
5. Output file: /sdcard/Tasker/btc.txt This creates a text file containing the data you pulled from the BitcoinAverage API
6. Done with that action. Now create a "Read File" action to read the data from file you created, and write it to a variable. Enter the path to the file above, and in the "To var" section, name a variable, mine is %BTC. (you can make this any character string you want, just make sure it's all caps)
7. Last action you need to create will like the variable you created with the Zooper Widget application. Click the plus to add an action, from the choices, select plugin, and then zooper widget. Edit the configuration so "ZW variable" is  and "ZW text" should be %BTC or whatever you named your variable.
8. I won't do step by step of the zooper part since it's pretty straightforward. Create a new widget, add text to it, then go to "Edit Text Manually" and enter  or whatever you named your zw variable above.
9. Now you need to set the text to update when the phone is in a specified state. I chose to make it update whenever I turn on display. Just go into tasker again and create a "Profile" choose event, then display, and finally "display on". Then just link the task you made previously with this profile and it should be working.
Not the best step by step, but let me know if you have questions and I can clarify 
Also, I used the paid versions of both Zooper and Tasker, however the premium apk's for both can be found through a quick google search

Edit: BIP0032 (HD wallets)?
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:56:41
LocalBitcoins or WallOfCoins.com
I've used neither though, so can't speak to the quality of their services.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:04:56
I didn't see anything mentioned about open source or any public code auditing.
The article doesn't specify much from a technical standpoint, but adding GSM, while useful, seems like a challenge to me since using it would require a sim card and phone service subscription (based on my understanding). I'd also be interested to know how the transactions are pushed through to the network, I'm assuming through some private CryptoLabs service tied in with the wallet.
But what if that service goes down, are the users screwed? We saw this recently with the Trezor wallet when the MyTrezor.com wallet was having issues. While resolved now, the problems left some people very upset at not being able to spend their coins. Going forward, Trezor will be supported in Electrum 2.0, and is being integrated into other wallets as well. I'd be interested to see what steps CrypoLabs plans to take to minimize or eliminate downtime issues due to the failure of centralized service offerings.
Additionally, I think it's imperative for any hardware wallet to integrate BIP0032 and 0039 (hierarchical deterministic wallets and mnemonic recovery seed). As currently seen in use on the Trezor hardware wallet, the combination of these two features allow wallets generated by the device to be recovered on other devices if the original device is rendered unusable. Thanks to these standards, users plagued by the abovementioned MyTrezor.com issues, were still able to import their wallets into other clients and spend funds/sign transactions from there.

Likely some issue with the QR code on her end. Could be some malicious software or scripting displaying a fraudulent QR. Doesn't really sound like a scam to me though...what kind of scammer plans to give you cash up front, and then making you feel guilty enough to give it back?
I've not used LocalBitcoins, but in the future I would suggest either some form of escrow, or to consider transferring straight to her wallet. To be honest, it is her responsibility to ensure she gives you the proper address. If she shows you the QR and says 'send it here' all you should be obligated to do is prove that you sent it to the address corresponding to the displayed QR; nothing more. A similar situation would be if you withdraw btc from an exchange and provide them with the wrong address, they're not at fault.

Not specific to medical records, but certainly applicable: blockchain tech can be utilized to provide distributed proof existence of documents, which can be useful in proving that a concept or idea existed at that point in time, and that information has not been amended in at a later date.
This may be a stretch, but an example of this in use could be in the future (where medical records are maintained in a less centralized manner) when people request their medical records from a hospital. Hospital gives patient a USB drive containing their raw medical records. The information is now in the patient's possession, and could possibly be altered or changed to show incorrect historical information and would then be rendered useless as an official record of account in any legal proceeding. If the originating hospital generates a hash of the record and embedded it in a blockchain-based transaction, then any hospital with access to the blockchain information would be able to tell if the records had be changed since their release, and courts would be able to accept the record as evidence during litigation as it's authenticity, origin, and previous existence can be verified without any participation or cooperation from any other party.

Yes, especially this! I think there's really no policy that will work for both parties 100% of the time. (unless there's some type of risk insurance company that underwrites every transaction allowing both parties to have an even trade. Even then, I think there may be some incentive for some to game the system) The best policy therefore, is to be completely upfront and clear about the whatever policy is chosen, so users can make an educated choice on how they'd prefer to pay.
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:36:06
Depends on how you define "best".
If "best" is most secure, your best bet is probably an offline machine, using Armory or Electrum. You can sign transactions offline to spend funds.
If "best" is most convenient, I'd say probably the Blockchain.info wallet. Others might suggest one of the trusted Android wallets. However, keep in mind, that there is a trade-off between security and convenience: more convenient is usually less secure
If you're like myself, and at times desire a high level of security, yet other times desire high level of convenience, you could utilize both approaches. I personally suggest keeping the majority of btc in cold storage, using a pc that is offline, airgapped, wrapped in 5 layers of foil, you get the idea... Then keep a small amount, &lt;1BTC on a Blockchain.info or other hosted wallet, or android-based wallet even, and use that for day to day spending, and other small transactions

The inherant value of bitcoin is in the increased automy and increased utility of using it. Gold and silver are great, but good luck sending that gold to a friend in China. Good luck storing it in a vault, and lugging it around anywhere you move to. Nobody is forcing you to buy any, or to 'invest' as you say, but I think it's pretty clear that it does have many benefits over a physical asset.

Great post, thanks for sharing! I've been implementing a similar setup on my MotoACTV smartwatch. I'm still tweaking it, but I've gotten it to display most apps, including several different bitcoin wallets, pretty well by adjusting the pixel density.
I've also gotten Authy to work, so lately I've been using the device as an offline 2FA security token. KeePassDroid is also working fairly well, enabling me to carry all necessary logins and passwords on a tiny, offline (airplaine mode) device. (Copying the random characters, however, is difficult. Consider using Diceware or similar methods to generate secure, easily readable, passwords using dictionary words and spaces.)
There are several more tasks I would like to get this little device to do, as well as a few small improvements to the applications I've already got running. The biggest thing I'd like to be able to do is to use the device to sign transactions offline. This can be done for the most part using the Mycelium bitcoin wallet, installed on both the smartwatch, and android phone. However, to sign the transaction, the mycelium application requires you to scan the private key of the wallet you're spending out of...this struck me as a place where security could potentially be compromised. 
It's probably okay to use, but I would much rather prefer a mechanism where the user could imput the necessary information on the android phone, which would then use bluetooth to send the unsigned transaction complete with unspent txoutputs of the sending address, to the smartwatch, which would then simply endorse the transaction with the private key, and send it back via bluetooth, where the android phone can verify the transactions integrity, and push the signed transaction to the blockchain.
Only thing is, I've never created an Android application before. I am working on learning though, so I can develop this utility eventually

This is how it must work in the beginning. Eventually, there won't be a need for you to use a debit card to spend btc, and you won't need a credit card to buy it. Truthfully, you don't need either of those now, however there is some tradeoff between freedom and convenience.
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:48:24
If I may offer a suggestion, which may not be possible given the design of your platform and cost structure, I believe you should considering lowering your minimum bet. 
I currently use another bitcoin-only sportsbook that offers .001 minumum, which is quite attractive to those who just want to play around with a small amount of money or just test out the platform without loosing a significant dollar amount.
@_date: 2014-11-24 16:28:09
You are correct, and there have actually been several implementations of equity markets similar to those you describe. Several of the more notable markets have closed down due to regulations, but there are still several markets operating. Securities are bought and sold using only cryptocurrencies, and mainly in btc. You may have also heard that Overstock is working with Counterparty developers on creating a digital asset exchange platform, to be called [Medici](
Some of the markets require verification of some information from the asset issuer, so they at least know who they are (not that this offers any recourse in most cases). However, other markets do not require such verification and essentially allow anyone to create and issue a security.
The major issue of these markets is by far accountability. There is little to no effective means to hold the asset issuer accountable to similar standards you would see upheld in conventionally regulated financial markets; it just isn't possible. While many in the bitcoin world are familiar with the phrase *Caveat emptor* or 'Buyer beware', one can only go so far. It's possible, and relatively easy, for a person to establish a credible persona and business, run the business for several years without hitch, and then just take off one day never to be heard from again. It's happened countless times, and it will happen again.
On your point of selling shares in oneself, this is also happening already, albeit not in bitcoin (*yet*). The most notable example being [Mike Merrill, who sold 100,000 shares of himself at $1 each.]( Another example of a similar investment in another indivudials success is [Fantex.com, a website that sells shares linked to the income of a pro athlete brand.](
These are both interesting advances from today's typical corporate equity investments, and you're likely to see other similar offerings in the future. While I feel bitcoin or blockchain technology is the natural progression of any modern financial trading market, accountability becomes a significant issue, just as it already is in bitcoin-denominated securities markets. How can investors who own equity shares in an individual be sure that the individual they invested in won't just stop paying dividends, or just disappear one day?

@_date: 2014-03-21 15:31:01
I like this idea.
But how do you decide what to include and to what depth? Many of the more advanced bitcoin applications require some prerequisite knowledge of cryptography, economics, etc. and if your target audience is one of lesser exposure to these topics, how do you draw the line? Thorough explanations could result in quite a lengthy book I would imagine.

Interesting perspective; personally, I think it's all about the fees. Places like walmart stand to gain an exorbitant amount of money through the elimination or reduction of credit card fees. I think they see the ApplePay 'revolution' as a way for them to piggyback their own electronic payments portal.
Additionally, by deploying this type of payment network themselves, they are allowed access to a vast amount of data that they would have previously had to pay somebody else for. Check out some of the data CurrentC collects from users...it's crazy. They're even collecting health data.
As I stated in another post, I think CurrentC's transaction initiation mechanism (QR codes) is incredibly congruent with how we use bitcoin today. At it's worst, CurrentC primes people on what a QR code is, and how it can be used to facilitate payments. At best, they may find a way to integrate a bitcoin payment option within the application itself, which would basically make it a bitcoin wallet with the additional option to use ACH bank transfer instead...which would be pointless from my point of view.

Sorry, but that's not an accurate assertion.
How would 7% of your BTC belong to OP? You could say it may have once been a part of stolen gox funds (figuratively) but unless OP himself owned 7%, this does not compute.

You could probably withdraw the funds, then ask the bank to temporarily freeze your account, this is probably your best bet. Or just quickly withdraw the funds, but I'm not sure if the bank will honor the Coinbase transfer regardless of account balance, which would set you at -$600, plus applicable fees.
Which bank are you with? If you wind up calling them about this, please **don't insinuate any fraudulent activities** associated with the Coinbase transfer, as many banks are preemptively canceling or freezing accounts that transact with Coinbase as a result of people canceling transactions and fraudulent activities associated with btc usage.

Looking at GMX's password recovery process, to recover an account it looks like they will either send an email to        s******

Do you mean Blockchain.info? If I'm not mistaken, they make money from providing services like the shared wallet feature and others that cost the user a small fee in exchange for the desired benefit. They also make money from advertisements, and partnering with companies to integrate services into their platform, like they did with SatoshiDice. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 18:02:54
First off, which software are you using?
The proper solution really depends on what you're ultimately trying to do, and what type of business you're conducting (as well as your security model). However, assuming you just want access to the funds without waiting for the client to sync, you can create an account with blockchain.info (or another trustworthy web-hosted wallet that lets you import private keys), and import the private keys from the wallet software client into the blockchain.info web interface. From there, you should be able to use the coins without issue. I haven't used the -qt client very much lately, but the private keys will be in the wallet.dat file if you cant find them somewhere in the client's UI.
And just side note, since I know you're new to this: you shouldn't capitalize the C in bitcoin, and the abbreviation is typically btc or xbt :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:45:06

@_date: 2014-10-27 18:42:39
It's almost impossible. A large part of keeping one's btc secure is operations security. You shouldn't expect a layman to comprehend the different operations security measures involved in securing information like a private key, as it's simply not relevant to them in real life. Developing proper opsec takes time, and commitment.
I think the real solution to this will be hardware wallets that allow users to easily store funds offline, while retaining the ability to sign transactions and push them out to the network. I think the Trezor (is a huge step in the right direction in this regard, and I can only hope that further developments in this space enable non-technical users to maintain a high level of security over their digital assets.
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:39:16
..."ship it to another vendor to hold for me"
What is this...gold? Is it that hard to create an address securely?
The point of bitcoin is that you don't have to ship anything to anybody to hold. Hold it yourself. Trust nobody.
By letting another party maintain control of your funds, you're allowing them to have this sort of power over you. Nobody can ever cancel your bitcoin address.
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:23:46

Saw this thread and immediately thought of bitcoin.
No way I would trust PayPal or GoogleWallet to not freeze the funds for no reason. Bitcoin is really the only way, plus multi-sig wallets can allow more than one person to control the money, and the blockchain keeps everything entirely transparent. There's really no other way to accomplish this.

Sorry to break it to you man: at this point, mining bitcoin effectively requires specialized hardware. There was a point early on where you could mine using a CPU, but those days are long gone. 
If you're interested in mining just for fun, you should look into purchasing a USB block erupter from eBay just to play with. I picked up one for like $5 + shipping, and it's been kinda cool just getting the mining software setup and getting it actually mining. You won't probably won't earn anything at all, but learning the process can be fun for some.

To my knowledge, there is no currently existing way to purchase conventionally traded securities with bitcoin. What kind of stock are you wanting to purchase?
There used to be several exchanges that would let you trade cryptosecurities denominated in bitcion. Many of the underlying companies turned out to be poorly run, or just outright scam operations. There are still some cryptosecurities marketplaces existing, for example the once renowned MPEx.co; another example being cryptostocks.com

@_date: 2014-11-19 22:52:20
It seems you would need a computer or some device to generate the new receiving addresses. Hierarchical deterministic wallets can use a master public key, which would allow you to generate all of a wallet's addresses, without private keys. So you could have a paper wallet that contains the master pub and private keys, but you would have to generate a new receiving address from the master pub key each time.

The mod who chose the random number did it on livestream, using what looked like random.org, but all of that is easily altered to return a predetermined result. So again, can anyone *prove* this person was selected randomly?
If you can't prove it was random, it's probably not a good method of selecting a 'random' millionaire.

Is this for the 'correct horse battery staple' address? If so, who cares...why would you send any money there?
As far as the scripting, there's many ways to accomplish that. You could surely use python though. Its easy since the private key for the address is already known, theres nothing to bruteforce; simply have your script listening for transactions to be broadcast to that address, and when they are, send them to another specified address.

comma in the first sentence
oxford comma in the last sentence of last paragraph
Why is the second paragraph 2 sentences?
Overall, the paper is okay. What class is this for? I think a clearer thesis would help, as I'm unsure what the central focus of this paper is besides 'Bitcoin'. I feel like you could have explained things a bit more in depth at times. It seems a bit short for a formal research paper. Also, there were several parts that could have been made clearer by choosing more precise language and reducing the use of pronouns. The end of the paper could be confusing to a reader who's not familiar with bitcoin or apple pay. Based on what your wrote, they might be thinking "what new security measures does apple pay have?, How is it a hybridization...does it use bitcoin?"
While this depends on the course this paper is for, I think a great research paper would be a comparison between apple pay and bitcoin, with an analysis portion and suggestions for future improvement. That'd be good for at least 10 pages easy 
I can offer more advice, but these are just my first thoughts. Ask me a question if anything is unclear.

Yes, it is possible. But there is a reason it's not there already. The focus of this particular subreddit is more about Bitcoin itself: the software, the protocol, the progression. We're not too focused on the day-to-day, minute-to-minute, price changes. Head over to for that.

A decent amount to start with. If I was you, I would create wallets using a few different services and practice sending the funds back and forth. Download the bitoin-qt client or electrum and practice sending funds from that to a web-hosted wallet. Get an android bitcoin wallet, and practice sending to and from that, practice scanning qr codes and generating receiving addresses. Practice generating paper wallets offline, then send the funds to the wallets and practice sweeping the keys into a different wallet.

As others have pointed out, data transmission via sound is definitely possible, check out chirp.io for one example. I remember reading some threads from people who were looking to apply similar tech to the bitcoin protocol to send/receive transactions from otherwise airgapped PCs.
Though, to be honest, I don't think transmitting the receiving address via sound would be the easiest solution to your problem. There are too many factors that can make transmission difficult; for example, what if it's loud where you are? Or what if you miss the beginning of the sound, or miss it entirely? I think a better solution would be the use of onename.io or similar services (like such.ly for dogecoin) that provide an easily readable and memorable URL that you can direct people to to send you btc. For example

Say the coins are sold for near their market value, as they were with the previous auction (correct me if I'm wrong). What benefit would investors in the crowdfunding campaign get from their contribution? If they wanted $1k usd of btc, they could just log on to any exchange and purchase it and receive it instantly. Why introduce additional steps and time?
I think the attraction to bidding on such a large volume of coins comes from the fact that they can be acquired without creating chaos on the open markets, and they can be acquired immediately, and in lump sum. These advantages do not translate well to the crowdfunded model, unless investors are planning to purchase a significant portion of the pool, like several hundred thousand to several millions usd worth, of which I suspect there are few people with that capacity and desire.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:39:56

Using Bitcoin to crowd fund projects is both incredibly innovative, and extremely risky.
There's projects on IndieGoGo that get funded x5, yet never bring a product into fruition; leaving many people with neither their initial investment, nor promised product. Sometimes, but not all the time, these people are able to obtain refunds through chargebacks, PayPal claims, etc. 
There is, as we all know, there is no such function in btc. It would be less risky if, for instance, if the contributed funds utilized some multisignature-type scripting, where they could be returned after a certain amount of time, with a certain number of investor votes or something along those lines

You'll likely face some regulatory hurdles if your're located in the US. 
The idea is sound though; I think drone delivery would be very efficient for certain use cases. That said, were you thinking of deploying into a specific market (for instance, medical diagnostic pickup/deliveries), or more of a general purpose service?
Regarding a more generally purposed delivery service, I would recommend including the ability to create shipments anonymously, as well as anonymous pickup of packages.

I could see the discount for bitcoin transactions, but offering such a substantial discount for cash transactions as well does not make much sense financially. Offering an 8% discount would increase the amount of cash they intake; however, significant expenditure is already required in counting, moving, and storing the physical assets. Offering the discount would further increase these expenditures and would only be worth it if the company would be saving an equal amount in credit card fees, which I am completely unsure of.

Why even use a service? Tell him he can pay a 0% fee by accepting bitcoin directly from customers (as it was designed) instead of involving any costly third party payment processors. 
Realistically, at least in the beginning, he probably won't have too many people paying in bitcoin. Plus, its a hookah lounge so transactions are not usually for very large amounts. So just hold the btc, and choose what to do with it at some point down the road.
Help him generate a secure wallet, and set him up with a tablet or smartphone he can monitor transactions with. Then just post a QR code of a receiving address for customers to scan with their phones and send btc to. No need to even wait for 1 confirmation either really. As soon as the transaction is visible on the network should be sufficient.
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:45:46
Yeah, 2FA is often the most secure you can get with many web services. I would also mention that its also critical to be sure your email address that's tied to your accounts is as secure as possible. That includes high entropy password, setting a difficult 'forgot password' question, and enabling 2FA, and maybe even stuff like Tor IP blacklisting or other restrictions your email provider may provide. On top of that, be sure it's hosted with a trustworthy email provider, or if it's hosted on your own custom domain, be sure you've set it up securely. Even with a secure backend in place, I've seen several instances where users who had their emails at, for example 'me have their accounts compromised due to a social engineering attack on the domain registrar. A similar attack was just successfully executed against the BitcoinTalk forums. Also, be sure your 2FA device is secure. Long PIN, lock after turning off screen, turn on full device encryption.

I suppose it ultimately depends on the price you're purchasing one for, how long it takes until it's actually mining, and the cost you pay for electricity, not to mention the increasing difficulty rate.

If you've actually done the math on these factors, I'm curious how long are you targeting to achieve ROI?

Just let customers pay in btc and tell them how they can obtain bitcoin. If you don't want to hold the coin, use BitPay or Coinbase on the backend to do the conversion and you'll end up with USD in your bank account.
While slightly more complex, a better, smoother idea would be to allow your customers to maintain an account balance (denominated in usd or btc) which is drawn from each time they use the app. Then they could contribute to their account balance using credit cards in denominations of $5 (or whatever amount works best with your fee structure) or deposit bitcoin in any amount they choose.

I think it depends on the initial purchase price of the first btc. If you bought it at 900, then yes. But if you bought it at $2, then no. I think...

I don't ever try to promote or evangelize it, but I will post links to videos from time to time. I think it's important to cultivate an awareness of bitcoin's existence, even if the people who see my posts don't start using it right away. There is a chance someone might discover something new that they find interesting, and that small chance is worth it to me.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:43:50
You're certainly right. However, I feel like that sentiment sets up people to be disappointed when btc/usd value doesn't skyrocket when they expect it to. I think tipping should convey one users appreciation of another users contribution, instead of something like "hey, this isn't worth much now, but just wait!" type of attitude. Bitcoin is immediately useful, no need to wait for it to increase in value. If I tip a user $3.50 for a beer, I want them to get a cold ass beer and enjoy it, not wait a couple years to see if they can maybe get 10 beers instead. That's part of the reason why I recommend tipping in amounts tied to real-world things, like a beer or a coffee for instance.
As a side note, I think (and very often observe) that people get too wrapped up in bitcoin as a value-gaining investment. While the USD/BTC exchange rate may increase over time, I believe that the utility and autonomy brought about by bitcoin and blockchain technology should championed over the potential increase of one's net worth. A great way for users to experience that is through tipping, and in turn, using the funds they've received as tips to buy something from the growing bitcoin economy. This is facilitated by tipping in usable amounts, using real-world items to judge actual value.

Except that's not what I'm talking about. If you read my other comments, you'll see that I was discussing the legality of a coinstar-like machine, that would allow customers to convert their fiat coins into digital assets.

I probably bought most of my coins above $600. But for some reason, seeing the exchange rate plunging makes me incredibly excited. Now I can buy even more btc. I always told myself if it got back to &lt;$300 I would go all in, and I think I'll be holding myself to that. If it goes &lt;$200, I think I would start taking out loans to buy btc. 
Am I crazy?

If it's open source, like Trezor is, you don't *have* to trust the manufacturer or developer. If you're unsure, you can confirm the device's authenticity yourself by auditing the source code or physically opening the device itself. Though this solution is one that may not always be within a user's capabilities.

Regarding the Casascius coins, I believe I read something about him using a method that would allow him to mint the coins with zero knowledge of the corresponding private keys...but I can't seem to find anything on that at the moment.
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:07:11
I think that's the best way to get started. Just buy like $10 worth. Practice sending to different addresses, take some different wallet softwares for a spin (electrum, Armory, bitcoin-qt), test some web-hosted wallets (blockchain, rushwallet), practice cold storage, making paper wallets, sweeping private keys, familiarize yourself with change addresses and how they work... man I could go on forever, there's so much to learn and it's all so interesting. I have no doubt you'll be an expert in no time ;)

Due to the built-in consumer protections of PayPal, I suspect you will not find many people willing to accept it in exchange for BTC. You would be better off linking your PayPal to a bank account and using Coinbase or other similar service to purchase btc.

Ah, yes. I suspected this might be your case. Other than finding a reputable localbitcoins seller, and depending on what you're purchasing, you may be able to negotiate an agreed upon exchange rate with the seller. I've done this before as a merchant when I only wanted to receive btc for the item i'm selling, and was willing to forgo potential losses in the interest of completing the transaction. Not everyone will be willing to do this though; you might just have to initiate the transfer on Coinbase and hope that the price remains in your favor until the funds are safely in your control.

It seems that rebit.ph is handling their remittances in this manner (or fairly similar). It appears to be working well enough thus far, but I don't know enough about their system specifically to comment further on its effectiveness.
There are several advantages to using bitcoin for this process, as you've pointed out. The disadvantages of your proposed model would be that the business needs to complete two conversions, which is not too big of an issue, but once the funds are in pesos, the company is subject to all the downfalls of a fiat financial system. Specifically, there will be some delay in electronically transferring fiat money to the recipients bank account, or the business will need a physical location for recipients to pick up their paper money from (for the unbanked).
Businesses in this sector are competing with the likes of Western Union, who boasts over 500,000 agent locations in 200 countries. This makes the physical locations part a bit difficult. I believe rebit.ph attempts to resolve this by working with different 'providers' to facilitate cash pickup.

I can't comment on the merchant of record, but regarding the return/refund policy, many bitcoin-accepting businesses that I've interacted with have a return policy that states that returns for transactions occurring in bitcoin will be made at the USD to BTC exchange rate at the time of payment. This seems to be a decent policy, from the businesses standpoint, otherwise people may have an incentive to return old items after the BTCtoUSD rate increases over time.
However, using the policy I explain above has the potential to hurt some customers who legitimately purchase products for btc, and then need to return them when the price has increased, as they will receive in return less btc than were initially sent.

This happens fairly often. Many news websites are using quotes from users here, and simply attributing them broadly to "one disgruntled user", for example. I've noticed this often with bitcoin-related things, and I believe that may be due to the fact that there's a relatively small portion of the population who even know what bitcoin is, let alone have comments and opinions on it's daily happenings. Places like and bitcointalkforums are often the media's only source of opinion from actual bitcoiners.
I have seen several instances where the user's reddit username was mentioned in context with their quote, but the user still was not made aware of it's usage. The least they could do is send the user a PM saying their text is going to be published publicly.

In my opinion, there's no such thing as a 'good' faucet. At least not anymore. Most faucets just give you a small fraction of a US cent, in exchange for your pageviews earning them some money.
While it can be a good way to get a little smidge of bitcoin to try things out with, I've found that it's a far better learning experience to take a small, yet meaningful amount like $10, and buy bitcoin with it to test things and play around with.

Sure, people are doing this. Check out 
The thing I really like about bitcoin remittances is that you really don't *need* any company to facilitate the exchange. You can use one if you prefer, but it isn't necessary by any means. Compared to the existing model, the optional autonomy offered by btc is an incredibly valuable feature.
The difficulty in this business is in converting from btc, into the local currency. Many smaller economies do not have the necessary bitcoin demand required for the remittance-provider to convert large amounts of btc into fiat dollars. Additionally, the infrastructure of third-world countries introduces an additional degree of difficulty. If you're processing remittances for people who are unbanked, you'll certainly need some type of physical location, or somewhere they can go to get their paper money. This is the reason why I feel it is better to find ways of offering liquidity for bitcoin in third-world countries, instead of purely providing remittances. That way, people in the US can send btc directly to their overseas counterparts, who can then exchange the btc to their local currency at their leisure.

That is the amount of btc included in the block, specified in bits, instead of btc.
To check yourself, convert this number into btc (404.399040) and multiply by the current exchange rate, and you will get a number close to the 'output total'
1 btc = 1,000,000 bits

It seems that the liquidity problem becomes less of an issue when working with a fiat currency. Unless the currency is collapsing or is incredibly unstable, there are still many many things it can be used for locally, despite the currency's comparatively low value in a global marketplace. Since it is the defacto currency of the country, one can expect most merchants to accept it, even if they would probably prefer USD (or maybe bitcoin) This inverse of this is true for bitcoin: relatively low utility for local usage, yet incredibly useful in global commerce.
So a business exchanging USD with phillipine pesos, for instance, is able to do so without much difficulty (compared to btc-fiat exchanges) because philipine pesos are immediately useful locally, and thus there exists a significant enough demand

The Piper is .8661 BTC ($229 USD)
From what I remember, it is basically just a RaspberryPi board hooked up with a thermal printer. So it probably wouldn't be difficult to create one for yourself. The pi is probably quite overpowered for this specific purpose, but it allows a degree of flexibility that would be more difficult to achieve with purpose-built hardware components.
The reason it hasn't been done already is that the development expenses likely outweigh the eventual profits, and there isn't significant demand for a device like this, because I can basically do all of that on my phone or computer (after taking several measures to preserve security)
You might be interested in Mycelium's Entropy device, which is almost exactly what you've described. Purpose-built, generates private keys, inexpensive, and small form-factor.

Sure, a FED backed crypto might legitimize blockchain-based technology, and would probably decrease the exchange rate of bitcoin. However, in such a system, bitcoin still has immense utility as a currency that's under control of any central entity. The US could put controls into their crypto that would not allow you to send fund to certain addresses they blacklist, but bitcoin would allow you to send money to anybody, anywhere.
Furthermore, a crypto backed by the US government would give people an opportunity to learn about and use digital currency first hand. I don't think it would be a stretch to say that once people become acclimated using the US-backed crypto, they might feel comfortable using other crypos that are not backed by a central entity and susceptible to manipulation.
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:52:14
It depends. First, ask yourself why you want to mine.
If it's for money, turn around now. You probably won't make any money mining bitcoin if you start now. It would require substantial capital investment, and you likely would not see much of a return unless you get free power, or you steal the miners from somebody else (dont do that).
If it's to support the bitcoin network, you're probably better off running a full node. Look into the different ways you can run a full node, there's many different tutorials here on this sub.
If it's for hobby or just to see how bitcoin works on that level, then go for it! A few months ago, I purchased an old ASICMINER usb miner just to play with, practice setting it up on an RPi, seeing how all the software works together. Cost me $10, I never expected to get any btc out if it, and I've learned a lot more about mining than i would have by just sitting on my ass replying to posts

They've already used Coinbase to integrate it. Now it's merely a matter of putting a button there so people know they accept btc without having to look around. Bitcoin's benefit is that it's quick, frictionless payment; not making it clear they actually accept btc is introducing unnecessary friction. They could easily add a button linking to bitcoin address allowing people to send donations in literally 2 clicks, why make it more complicated?

What are you asking for? If you're exchanging fiat currency for digital assets commercially, you are defined by FinCEN as a Money Services Business, meaning that you need to comply with their rules. Additionally, each state has their own respective requirements for these types of businesses, and require people conducting this type of activity to procure the proper license, and pay the (usually hefty) fee.

Like a reverse BitPay of sorts...
There was a service called CoinVoice that would allow you to invoice in dollars and receive btc, discussed here: 
But they've closed down a while ago.
I think this business idea isn't very compatible with the irrevocability of bitcoin. For instance, you send me an invoice for $100 USD, I pay with CC and you receive $100 USD worth of btc almost instantly. Well...5 days later I change my mind and file a chargeback, which leaves the payment processor on the hook for the funds, since they've already sent the BTC and have no recourse in getting it back.
Not to say it couldn't be done though. You would probably need to charge some fees to account for the increased risk for the payment processor, or you could do no/low fees, and require users to maintain a bond amount which would cover losses in the event of a chargeback. The bond would depend on the merchant's total transaction volume.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:27:33
If you want to acquire them all at once, then that is a risk you'll have to take. To help spread your risk, you could acquire your position through dollar-cost averaging; for instance, you could buy $180/day for 10 days, or $20/day for 90 days.
You shouldn't be so concerned with a price drop, unless your purpose for acquiring the btc is purely transactional (meaning you're only buying them so you can use them to buy stuff). The logic you describe doesn't make sense, since even if you were able to acquire the btc immediately, the price could still drop, and you would still have less value when exchanging to USD.
You can try localbitcoins, but I might be weary using it for the first time with such a large amount. If you find a reputable trader, you shouldn't have much of a problem though.

I sell on eBay and always include a statement in my listings that basically states that I accept btc, and to message me for payment information.
I've sold hundreds of items with this tag-line in the listing, but never had even one person ask about purchasing with it. I figured if anyone ever asked, I would have them send their coins to me and I would just mark the item as 'Payment Received', and ship to the mailing address of their choice.
Refunding bitcoin purchases could potentially create an issue, so I would say to tread lightly for now until a more formal framework is put in place for btc purchases on these platforms.
Also, depending on your product and target market, you may consider listing on one of several different online marketplaces created to accept cryptocurrencies. I don't have much experience here, but I've used CryptoThrift with some success recently. Check out OpenBazaar as well, I think this will be an e-commerce gamechanger in a year or two.

Well, it wouldn't be a phone. Android device, maybe..but it seems to me that cell phones are inherantly insecure. Part of the trezors advantage over other storage mediums is that it can not be accessed remotely, and only functions when plugged in by a user. However, removing the phone aspect limits the usability of such a device; as we see with the trezor, its not quite a device you would use for daily small transactions. 
Best solution would probably be a phone that was compatible with an expansion card. All security and bitcoin authentication would occur on the card, and not the phone itself

Probably doubtful, but if you're using BTC at all, you should be sure your security is thorough anyways. Both in the software and restrictions you implement on your computer, as well as the actual steps you take in accessing your computer and storage, ie. your operations security (
I would be wary of any emails coming from unknown addresses, as well as phishing emails that could appear to originate from a trusted entity.

How are you storing it?
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:15:01
You should store your seed phrase in multiple places, to mitigate risk of fire, natural disaster, or other circumstances from destroying your only copy of the seed. A lockbox at another family member's house, a safe deposit box at local bank, encrypted volume uploaded to cloud storage would all be viable options. The more places it's stored (as long as it's stored securely), the less you need to worry about keeping any individual copy being destroyed.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:02:28
Ledger wallet is similarly regarded as a high quality cold storage solution. Personally I prefer the trezor though.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:24:41
Yes, it is possible. Not likely, but the risk is definitely non-zero. 
Personally, I would prefer to order directly from trezor.io. Though they do have several different packaging measures in place in an attempt to make tampering evident, if you're someone who needs to take every possible precaution, it would be best to acquire the device directly from its manufacturer.

Price has held steady through the weekend, anticipating moderate increase to start the work week tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:21:32
If you can afford to take on the risk, it's certainly something to consider. Though I'm curious what effect the segwit2x action coming up in a few weeks will have on the price, especially given the rapid increase after the bcash 'split'.
If you're uncertain about plunking down a lump sum investment, consider dollar-cost averaging to acquire your position. Just set up an automatic buy every week, some percentage of your income or your target investment amount. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:57:29
Of course it will. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:16:01
Likely because the demand commands a higher price in the market. In an exchange, sell orders placed below that price will get gobbled up quick, because people want to buy at what they perceive as a good price.

Not sure how merchants are handling bitcoin volatility on a day-to-day basis, but assuming that the capital isn't immediately required to pay operating expenses, a good option would be Coinapult Locks or BitReserve, which let you hold bitcoin assets pegged to a specified fiat currency. Though I'm sure there are some costs for using both services, they are probably less than the model you propose.

Though a usable UI is necessary, do your best to explain the benefits beyond just 'its new and it looks cool'.

General advice for in-person trading: Don't take their word for anything. Verify everything that happens. I can't remember how LocalBitcoins works these days (on or off chain transactions), but don't trust anything they show you on their device screen, as it could have been modified. If they say they sent to your address, then check that for youreself on your own device. Waiting for 1 confirm is probably good measure. Bring a friend, dont keep the wad of cash in your pocket, maybe conceal it somewhere not so obvious. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:50:15
Yes. There is a billion dollar grey and black market economy running on bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies). While many people do treat it as a speculative instrument, there are many more that use it as currency, to obtain goods that their respective governments have forbid citizens from obtaining.
@_date: 2015-11-30 22:34:09
If you don't know what tumbling does, then it's probably not necessary. If you attempt to tumble your bitcoins, and don't know what you're doing, there's a chance you'll loose them.
You should take some time to research different hardware and software wallets and services, and determine which one works best for your use case. Coinbase probably isn't where you want to keep them, at least on a permanent basis. Whatever you choose, you should ensure you know how to use it properly, and that you are regularly backing up your data to ensure your finds cannot be lost due to user error.

Surely a problem, this is something I deal with in conventional banking pretty often. You can only withdraw $300/day via ATM, the bank only has so much cash you can withdraw in person. So if you have $100k in your Chase checking, good luck getting that out.
With bitcoin it's still an issue, actually probably even worse since you have to deal with Coinbase's arbitrary limits, as well as your banking institution. The sad part about this is that there's really not much that can be done about it; it's just the nature of interfacing between bitcoin and legacy currency.

Someone else can answer this much better, but I believe the server indexes the blockchain differently so that it can easily be used by each client without downloading the whole thing.

What is the mechanism behind the scenes? CoinJoin, something else?
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:41:24
If the transaction was successfully broadcast to the network, then the coins are where the transaction sent them to. Check for yourself, type your sending address into a block explorer (blockchain.info, blockr.io, etc.) and see if the transaction is listed.
If it didn't broadcast, then the coins are still in the sending address. Use a blockexplorer to check.
If electrum is not showing the updated balance, you could still create and sign a transaction using those same inputs, but it would not be valid (since they've already been spent) and it would not be confirmed by the network.
Also, is good for these sort of questions. You'll probably get more responses.

Maybe, but even if there are, you will still face similar limits when transferring the funds to a bank. Over $3k USD, you'll need to file the proper forms, make sure you pay the required taxes, etc. Even then you will not be able to obtain the actual cash for your btc, you'll just have "bank credits" denominated in USD. 
This is why I'd much rather just keep the bitcoin as bitcoin. If you hold a ton of btc and need to hedge against price fluctuation, you can do the same thing they do in institutional finance, which is to hedge using options.

Nooooo, bitcoin and 'The Blockchain' go hand in hand. It's possible to create an altcoin, that would utilize its own seperate blockchain. Some people are creating services that leverage bitcoin's blockchain, like Factom (really only partially, i guess). Other services are creating their own, completely seperate, blockchain and token, like Ethereum. The advantage is that you can implement things that would not be possible, or would be difficult to do on the bitcoin blockchain.
Don't think of it as 'us vs. them'. We don't need to put every single thing on the bitcoin blockchain. Sometimes it's better to have a purpose-built solution for a specific need, like an in-house corporate-coin, or maybe an interbank-coin.
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:42:28
I used to own LTC but decided that it was pointless. Since then, whenever ltc comes up, I like to ask people this: Why do you think litecoin is useful, besides the oft-touted lower block times?

@_date: 2017-05-22 19:38:55
Yes. The price went up because other people are willing to pay more money to hold bitcoin. Either because they think the value will go up over time, or because bitcoin itself is more useful to them compared to legacy payments. The price is fueled by actual utility as well as speculation.
As far as 'people just implementing their own currency' I assume you mean 'implementing their own currency without government permission'. Consider the fact that literally anything can function as money, as long as others are willing to provide something of value in exchange. Government-backed monies are attractive because there is some assumed degree of safety, since "if the government endorses it, it must be okay". This assertion in blatantly false in both economic theory and in practice. The real value of $1USD has dropped catastrophically, yet many people do not realize this, since the dollar is the defacto currency unit of comparison, and therefore, to most people $1USD = $1USD.

Well, personally, I've reached a point where I'm starting to loathe the legacy banking system and wish it was feasible to hold all my assets in bitcoin. The banking system does literally nothing for me that I can not do myself. With that said, if someone were to offer me $20k in USD without the btc option, I would convert it to bitcoin without hesitation. So faced with the options between USD and BTC, I wouldn't even think about taking the USD because even if their exchange rate is the same, bitcoin's utility makes it infinitely more valuable.

There are surely difference between the two, but I've not used the latest Ledger hardware, so I can't say which is objectively better. I have used Trezor extensively, have seen their devs active in the community for many years prior to Trezor's existance. For most purposes, I think the two devices are more or less interchangeable.

Don't have time to listen at the moment, but I'm assuming he provides some foundation for this argument? TLDR of his points for us who can't listen maybe?
I've never really bought the 'defense that attacking bitcoin isn't a profitable venture, therefore it will never happen' argument. It probably holds true for most individuals in most situations, but not all. Some parties could benefit indirectly from the collapse of bitcoin (in other ways besides just shorting it), so it might by a worthwhile endeavor for them to try and bring it down.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:52:51
Yeah, sounds like an issue getting connected to a server. Have you sent from Electrum on this machine before? Check the Network settings and make sure you have the correct ports selected. What OS are you using? Perhaps Windows Firewall is preventing the outgoing connections.
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:55:08
Also, I think you can recreate the transaction using the same inputs and increase the fee and it should get picked up. That's if blocks are confirming and this transaction still hasn't been included.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:04:28
For daily use, I would combine the Trezor hardware wallet with Electrum wallet software. Or one of the compatible web-wallets of your liking.
I would be confident that the funds stored on Trezor are secure, so I wouldn't have a problem storing most or all of my funds there. However, depending on other investments or valuables you might already have, a paper wallet may fit within your existing security model. For instance, if you already use a safe deposit box to store some gold and stock certificates, then the use of a paper wallet to store some additional funds would be a rather intuitive way to do it. This would be good for your $10k+ storage. Be sure to have redundant backups, and even use BIP38 for additional security.
Tails/Whonix/Tor really only need to be involved in this process if you are attempting to conceal your activity beyond the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:17:12
You may have a point. The majority of my purchases have been for smaller, inexpensive items; if the merchant scammed me I wouldn't have too upset. If it was, for instance, a $5k USD purchase, I would probably think twice regardless of my desired method of payment. Though I don't think I would give my bitcoin *or* my credit card and billing information to a merchant that I didn't deem trustworthy.

There is significant value to blockchain analysis, especially in the case of theft. Although bitcoin addresses are not attached to real-world identities, you can still reveal a great deal of information just based on the incoming and outgoing transactions and their patterns and histories.
Real world identities are most often attached to bitcoin addresses at the entry and exit points; the exchanges. So by examining an address, the Evo DNM address for example, we can see if funds are sent to known exchange addresses, and then using the existing legal framework of the country the crime was committed in, subpoena the exchange which would reveal the person's real identity that they submitted when creating their account.

Well, if you want to be extra safe, you should use a dumb printer that won't keep record of the files you print, and doesn't have firmware that could be compromised. Walmart has printers &lt;$30, any of those would be sufficent for this purpose. You don't necessarily need to buy one, but I probably wouldn't a kinkos or library printer. If you wanted to do that, you would probably need an ethernet cable (RJ45) or a USB AtoB cable.
Depending on what you're trying to do with the paper wallets, it might actually be easier to generate a seed phrase for an HD wallet. Then there's no printing necessary, all you would need to do is write down a 12-24 word phrase. You could also use a password on top of the written phrase to give you an extra layer of security and also deniability.
Also, make sure you know how to properly sweep funds from the paper wallet, and how change addresses work:

You seem naive. It's for sure a scam, but perhaps not quite as blatant as you might be used to. It makes more sense for the site operator to conduct their operation as if it were a legitimate business, instead of just stealing everyone's money right of the bat. 
Just think logically for a minute: you deposit your bitcoin and then you get free money every 60sec. Does that even seem plausible to you? Where do you think the money is coming from...? 


So, sure, you can make free money. But it's neither legitimate, nor trustworthy, and you should definitely not send any coins that you wouldn't mind loosing. Also, at 3% per day, you're way better off just straight up betting on sports events or something.

Bitcoin - the defacto cryptocurrency; the price of most other cryptos is denominated in btc.
Ethereum - second largest crypto by market volume. Some interesting technical aspects I won't get into. Much controversy regarding their hardfork a few months ago. I never bought in because of this, but now I wish I would have grabbed at least a couple ETC while they were cheap.
Litecoin - although ltc as fallen by the wayside, it's currently being used as a testbed to test features that will eventually be added to bitcoin. It is useful in this role, but  I personally do not see much use aside from this.
Honorable mention:
Namecoin - although it doesn't get the excitement it once did, I think the concept of a decentralized domain name system is fascinating. This is a good example of 'applied cryptocurrency'; that is, using a blockchain-based asset for something other than exchanging monetary value.
Monero - Lots of chatter in the past couple years about this privacy-based crypto. I don't have much knowledge about it's technical aspects, but it's certainly worth looking into if you haven't already.

Cloud mining is just a scheme to take advantage of naive people in the bitcoin space. Some operations actually have hardware running, but others just pretend that they do, and pay out based on a calculation of what that hardware *would* do if it were actually running...aka a ponzi scheme.
At this point, mining is a pointless venture for most individuals. If you're truly interested in how it works, then buy a $10 USB miner off ebay and set it up on a raspberrypi. If you only wanted to make free money, then just move right along.

@_date: 2015-03-09 17:25:49
This is a super general question, what exactly do you want to know, and in what context? I guess I'll start at the top...
Trezor - Hardware wallet, good for everything. Stores keys in hardware so it can be used safely on a compromised machine. Compatible with many wallets including MyTrezor.com, GreenAddress.it, Electrum, MultiBit, and recently CoinPrisim, with support for more wallets presumably on the way.   
Electrum - Software wallet. This is the software I usually use for bitcoin transactions. It's an SPV wallet, meaning it does not require the full blockchain in local storage; it uses trusted servers to gather that information. As a result, there are some concerns with maintaining privacy. This is probably a good wallet if you're not doing thing illegal or that you might want to hide.
Armory - In contrast with Electrum's thin-client design, Armory is a software wallet that *does* require the full blockchain. Armory is well known for its cold storage features and offline signing ability, and it's overall secure design.
Paper wallets - can be created using a variety of different services/softwares/code. Basically, it's just a printout of the public/private keypair for a single bitcoin address. You can give people the public key, and they can send you funds. Don't loose the private key. Many consider paper wallets to be the most secure form of bitcoin storage, but they are only really secure provided they are created in a secure manner using trusted code for key generation and probably on an offline machine.
Tails - is a linux distro designed for security. It's a liveOS with Tor already configured. All you need to do is install the OS to a USB or CD and boot the machine. It's pretty user friendly, and features an optional persistent storage volume. Recently seen in use by Ed Snowden in the Citizenfour documentary
Whonix - another security/privacy-focused linux distro, but this one is a little bit more complex to understand. I've only recently started learning about whonix, but the idea is to use a pair of virtual machines, known respectively as a gateway and a workstation. This architecture prevents even malware running as root from discovering your actual clearnet IP. You'll need virtual box for this
Tor - tor is a software that allows anonymous connection to the internet by basically bouncing your connection to different servers around the world. There are some security concerns regarding man in the middle attacks (basically attacker impersonating reputable web pages) Tor is the software used to provide anonymity in both of the above-mentioned operating systems.
Also, check out for questions like these, you'll probably get more responses.
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:13:27
Maybe, but after you account for power costs and your time, you won't be making very much. Consider that many cloudmining companies have had to shut down or "pause" their miners over the past few months. These are companies allegedly running warehouse-sized datacenters that are purpose-built to house running machines. And if they aren't breaking even, then it's reasonable to assume that a entry-level hobby miner won't have much luck either.
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:29:57
You seem angry. 
Shitcoins have a meaningful purpose in the bitcoin ecosystem. First of all, bitcoin is a form of privatized money, and currently one of the only ways we can observe and take part in truly free-market dynamics. In such a market, anyone is free to create their own forms of money, and the consumer is free to select and use whichever suits them best. 
The people who create these other types of money are free to implement whichever changes they deem necessary, which allows a degree of experimentation that's currently not feasible to do with the bitcoin blockchain. If some alt-coin develops an interesting, desirable feature, maybe it can be added to bitcoin. If it cant, maybe it's possible that it's even better than bitcoin; people are able to make this distinction for themselves and use whichever currency they prefer. 
It's all about giving a person the ability to make choices for themselves.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:59:12
Not if you secure it properly.
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:08:56
The Trezor hardware wallet can be safely initialized and used on an infected machine. You mention that your coin is stored on exchanges..if you're planning to use the infected laptop to withdraw from them, you should use a live CD, like Ubuntu. Verify the image hash before you flash it to a CD, then just boot into the live system, generate the wallets and transfer from the exchanges.

@_date: 2015-03-13 19:00:04
The answer probably somewhat depends on your level of technical aptitude. There are several 'good' ways to store your coin, and Circle is not one of them. If you're not confortable taking total control of your own funds, then maybe you should leave them in Circle..but be aware that if Circle ever disappears, then so does your money. 
Some of the most secure ways to store btc involve the use of an offline-only device. This can be an android device, iphone, computer, old laptop, you get the idea. The point here, is that the computer is never connected to the internet. You can do all your key generation on this machine and be fairly confident that those keys can never be accessed. Paper wallets created on an offline machine are also a good solution, but make sure you know how to spend from them and how change addresses work.
If you're pretty comfortable on a PC, and know what makes a secure password, you might be well-served using a software like Electrum on an offline computer. Other options for mobile operating systems are Mycelium, breadwallet, among others.
For the amount that you have, over $2k USD, I would advise you to apply a tiered approach to your bitcoin storage. This allows you some convenience, while not sacrificing too much security. For example, maybe you store 2btc on your daily-use phone, using Mycelium with pin-protection on both the wallet and the phone. Different pins for each. Consider this your 'checking account'. Make sure to write down the seed phrase it gives you. Write it twice, store it in different places. Maybe stash one somewhere at work incase you loose your phone, you'll still have some money.
Then, back at home, you can use an old laptop to create an cold electrum wallet. Boot Tails linux, or another liveOS, run electrum, and write down that seed phrase on 3 separate pieces of paper. Double check you wrote it correctly. Also copy a few of your public keys, you'll need these to send btc to the coldwallet. After you create the wallet, you can shut down the computer and the keys you generated will be erased. Take one piece of paper, put it in your safe deposit box. Take another, and hide it behind your favorite picture on the wall. Take the third, and give it to your mom, tell her what it is as best you can...in case something happens to you, she'll be able to have access to your treasure.
Truthfully, you should execute all these steps using maybe .1 btc, just to test it and make sure you actually know how to restore from seed, spend from paper wallets, etc. 
For an *even higher* level of security, you could consider purchasing a Trezor hardware wallet (about $100, maybe less), and integrate it into the steps above. It is compatible with Electrum, and soon Mycelium, as well as others. In addition, using Trezor, you could actually skip the whole offline computer portion; since the keys never leave the Trezor device, it is safe to initialize on a compromised machine.
Edit: made some edits
Major points:   
- Tiered storage   
- Offline-only machine   
- Do a run-through, know how to use your setup      
- REDUNDANT BACKUPS, store them separately   
- Test different software to figure out what you like best   
- Hardware wallet is best wallet

You know, this is a good point. I don't know that I would describe it in the same manner, but I've always kinda thought that some of the most transformative social progress has come from monarchies and other forms of near-absolute ruling power. After witnessing the stagnant progress of the US government over the last decade, it could be argued that we might actually benefit from having someone saying "Okay, fuck it, we're doing this and nobody has a choice". But, I think that's partially a result of voters not being properly educated on the issues at hand (as demonstrated in the thread), and also a result of our weird ruse of a political system. We like to make people believe that they have a voice and that their vote matters, when in reality, people in the US are more disenfranchised then ever. We've created a false dichotomy from a vast spectrum political ideologies, and our legislature embodies this in every possible way. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:49:02
It's crazy. Once you use it for a few things and then run into a site that *doesn't* accept bitcoin, it really makes you think twice. Why would I give up all my personal information like name, address, CC etc., when I can just skip all that and pay with btc? It's completely unnecessary, especially when buying digital goods that never need to be shipped. Or even more so when donating to a person or a organization.

@_date: 2015-03-05 20:33:44
Well, a good question to start with would be...who is your adversary? or, who are you attempting to hide from?
First off, buying with cash on localbitcoins is pretty anonymous by itself. Identities are typically revealed through exchanges, where customers have to provide identity in order to exchange btc. VPN + Electrum probably isn't going to do much for you but hide your IP from the electrum server. I guess it wont hurt though. If this is just a one-time thing, you could use a web-based wallet like RushWallet or BC.i, connecting to the website from behind the VPN to cloak your real IP, then you wouldn't have to worry about electrum at all. Not sure why the servers aren't connecting though
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:45:31
Yeah, might be kinda useful. Perhaps I'll get working on this myself :)
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:46:36
Well if you're just doing it for hobby, does the hashrate even matter? I wanted to experiment with setting up an ASIC miner on rPi, so I purchased an old ASICMINER Block Eruptor for $7 on eBay. Works perfectly.

@_date: 2015-03-19 15:32:41
Well, I believe that the increased use of *any* cryptography-based asset is a good thing for bitcoin. Many people are just here to make money for themselves, so you'll see some negativity towards altcoins and other non-bitcoin ideas that people think will somehow hurt bitcoin. The truth is, bitcoin probably isn't going anywhere anytime soon.  If there's a worthy competitor, then the markets will choose. 
Governments are free to create their own cryptocoins, and I think it would probably benefit them to do so. However, a gov-coin is missing several of the major advantages a user gets from using actual bitcoin. Nameley, the decentralization, the pseudonymity and the ability for nobody to block or censor your transaction. Do you think if the US government had their own crypto, that they would really allow free and open exchange of funds? We can see that this would not be the case just by looking at the PayPal-WikiLeaks fiasco. Without any actual legal action or court order PayPal stopped processing Wikileaks donations. They were simply pressured by several members of congress. Can you imaging if it was Congress actually controlled the coin itself?!
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:11:02
Think about it from the perspective of an eBay seller. Assuming they are legitimate, they are looking to trade an irrevocable asset for PayPal Bucks™. At any time and for any reason, PayPal can seize the funds from the seller, leaving them with no recourse, as bitcoin can not be seized in the same manner. Thus, the risk of chargeback faced by the seller, leads to a premium on the PayPal to bitcoin exchange rate. They are willing to expose themselves to a significant amount of risk, but only for a premium. This is how markets work.

Please don't get burned chasing a return on your BTC. I know some people are the gambling-type and want to increase their btc but it's not worth it in many cases. You really have to know what you're doing, otherwise you're probably better off playing blackjack or betting horses or something.

Haven't seen anyone mention this...but even though you're connecting to Electrum servers anonymously, I think they would still be able to link your addresses together, though not to your actual identity. While a malicious server would not know who you are, I think they would know that the addresses in your wallet are all associated to the same person. Unless I've misunderstood something...

There's no better way to understand bitcoin than to use it. In my opinion, everyone should make *at least* 1 bitcoin transaction per day, until the time where you no longer have to go "out of your way" to do so.

@_date: 2015-03-13 17:20:00

I like to take a tiered approach to bitcoin storage and wallet use. Consider Mycelium to be a checking account: you wouldn't keep your life savings there, but if you take proper measures, it can be reasonably secure. (set a pin on the wallet, set a different pin for your phone, full encryption on phone if possible, back up the seed in multiple places)
For many users, that wallet alone would be sufficient. However, as you approach the 4-figure range, most users would feel more comfortable taking some additional security measures to ensure their funds are safe, and remain that way. This usually takes the form of an offline-only machine, which is used to generate addresses, and sign transactions. Always offline. There's a variety of software that can accomplish this, you should test each one to determine which you prefer. You should also test every step of your storage, know how to create transactions and sign them offline. know how to transfer funds to another offline address, etc.
Instead of the offline machine, you could also use paper wallets, or the most secure option would be a hardware wallet like Trezor. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:07:30
I'm a little confused. First of all, you don't need to send any dust to generate the addresses. You can generate receiving addresses via the app. This transaction between Circle and the Wallet is unnecessary and actually ties your Circle identity to the previously unknown identity of both your bitcoin wallets.
You can't just juggle between the two wallets (or uninstall/re-install) to create anonymity. You'll possibly have some deniability (one couldn't necessarily can't prove those coins are or are not in your possession). But the addresses will be linked, and looking at a simple taint analysis on blockchain.info would make that very clear. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:05:02
Idk, dogecoin seems like a lost cause at this point. Just to warn you, investing in any of these currencies, including bitcoin, is incredibly risky. You can loose your money at any time, through a variety of different ways, some of which you may not even have knowledge of or understand. That being said, if you have a few hundred dollars to gamble with, I would definitely plunk some down on some of the smaller cryptos. I think it's easier for a smaller coin to go from $0.05 to $5 (100x) over a few years, than for ETH to jump from $200 to $20,000. Although both are certainly possible.

You seem confused. Sure, instead of publishing his whitepaper, Satoshi could have formed BitCoin Inc., filed a patent for the tech, and created BitCoin™. But that undermines the whole idea of bitcoin itself, and while still useful, it significantly reduces its security and utility.

@_date: 2015-03-04 17:52:01
A bitcoin user that doesn't want to download the whole blockchain has several options:
You can used a web-hosted wallet, like BC.i, or RushWallet, or GreenWallet, among others. These will not require you to store the blockchain, but you will probably sacrifice a small amount of security for the increased convenience. Some of these clients will require you to trust the provider, at least partially.
You can use a software wallet that doesn't require the full blockchain to operate. Two of the most notable being Electrum and MultiBit. These are called SPV clients, and utilize randomly selected trusted servers for their blockchain data. No local copy required. More on SPV clients and how they work, here: 
Third option is to use a mobile wallet. Notable ones here are Mycelium, Breadwallet, Bitcoin wallet (Sildbach), among many others. Same as SPV wallets, these also rely on trusted server(s) to obtain their blockchain data.

Yeah, should be fine assuming you generated a valid address and private key private key. Did you check the address on a blockexplorer to verify, or are you just looking at the wallet client? It is possible though that the address generated is insecure, using redundant r-value or deterministic random values, which may have been fixed in later iterations of the software.

I'll try and answer your question here though. I'm not sure what you mean by the 'their just some code' part. If you mean just some code, as in literally a redeemable code like an Amazon.com voucher, then you are misunderstanding the concept of bitcoin. If you're meaning that concept of digital currency itself exists as a software, and therefore as code, then that would make more sense. It's not as simple as just 'cracking the code', though.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:51:53
Sure, it's possible. But banks do not really benefit from the decentralized, trustless system bitcoin provides; at least in the context of interbank transfers. They do benefit from the speed, but if banks wanted to simply transfer funds internationally in that manner, I think they would create their own crypto-based asset, in which they would have total control over every aspect. There isn't the same issue of banks trusting one another like there is with peer to peer transactions, since the systems in place today already require a level of trust, and faith in a central authority, which I think most banks probably don't have an objection with since it works heavily in their favor.
Rather than simply improve the existing systems, I think bitcoin has a more transformative potential; allowing people to transcend the legacy banking systems of today, and provide an unprecedented level of autonomy over one's own assets.

I think a physical representation of this original mission would be a really great way to introduce people, and it would just be something cool and nifty, and you could make it sort of a contemporary art piece.
I think one device should be created, and it should go on a tour to locations around the world. Maybe stay in each place for a week or a month before moving on to the next.  It would be an attraction of sorts; bitcoiners will all want to come and see it and people new to bitcoin will want to come see what people are talking about. There are numerous museums featuring contemporary pieces about the SilkRoad, and even bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

You need either the wallet's HD seed, the private key, or the  wallet.dat file. Unless you've already copied that information elsewhere, you will need to remove the hard drive, and connect it to another machine. Then simply navigate to your btc wallet directory and copy the wallet.dat file to a different disk.
Use this as a learning experience. If you don't want to loose your btc, you *need* to back up your wallet in some secure way. If the situation was worse and the HDD was not recoverable, you would have just lost all btc stored on that machine.

Yes, many banks have a similar stance. I would advise against using your non-bitcoin accounts(either personal or business) for bitcoin related things. I will say that I have used Chase + Coinbase for btc purchasing over the last year with no issues at all. However, that's for probably 1-3 transactions per month. I guarantee that once the btc starts flowing, the account will get flagged eventually.
Unfortunately, I don't know of a bank that has defined a clear pro-bitcoin position...yet. So, for your situation, if you wanted to accept bitcoin, you should accept it and either hold the coins, or try and find ways to leverage the btc within your supply chain. Talk with suppliers and distributors about accepting it, their response might surprise you.

The weakest link is still the human element, but at least this way the government can't actually *prove* that you're hiding something. If setup properly using something like a trezor hardware wallet, you could create wallets from the same seed, using multiple different passwords. You could have one 'dummy' password that would open a wallet with 1BTC, just so you could claim that's all you have. And a different password would grant access to the real wallet, with your 1k BTC stash. you could even implement a similar system using TrueCrypt and raw wallet files or private keys.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:23:34

Yeah, there's a lot of people trying to leverage their access to free/cheap power by leasing the space for people to host their machines. I'm sure some are making money, but to be honest, most ventures in the mining space require far too much capital to make a significant return. Individual miners aren't making much these days; most of the effort is in warehouse-sized datecenters built specifically to house and cool running equipment. We've reached a point where efficiency plays a major role in a miners overall returns, so issues like cooling and network infrastructure play a big role. So unless you have access to a datacenter, you should probably focus your efforts to another area of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:43:13
That's true, but it still shouldn't be like that. If they want to control what software is on the device, maybe they should give the device for free. If I pay for it, it should be mine in every regard.

Trying to day-trade bitcoin is basically gambling. For a new user especially, I would not recommend getting too involved with the trading aspect, unless you're willing to loose everything you've invested.
There's not a whole bunch of markets to choose from. Some of the major players are: bitstamp, btc-e, coinbase, krakken, bitfinex, okcoin.
You shouldn't keep funds on an exchange, and if you *must*, it would be wise to limit the amount kept with them, since if the exchange disappears, so does your btc.
You also want to use an exchange that offers 2 factor authentication, not only for login, but for account withdrawals and for trades too. This way, an attacker would need your password, and access to your authentication device to steal your funds.

I have no idea what kind of discount SatoshiLabs would give for a 200+ group buy. If they are doing $89 after coupon at the moment, I think a bit of savings on top of that might be reasonable discount for such a large order.

Yep, basically this. I thought OKCoin's strategy was pretty good, but seemed to be a bit unnecessarily complicated. They should have just used a HD wallet and xpub key instead of generating 10k individual keys. The real question is what did they use to create the keys, and is it sufficiently random. I'm sure it is, but I don' think they really mentioned that in their write-up. 
Also, I think it's best to not use USB, especially recent with revelations about NSA backdoors on hardware, not to mention other non-state malware and all that. QR codes seem to be the most secure option to me.

At current state, mining is not a profitable venture for an individual. You may mine some coins, but you will probably not recoup your investment+cost of energy.

Now a real response: A reasonable tactic for a person faced with your dilemma would be to acquire your position through dollar-cost averaging. Spread your $5k investment over a period of time, 3 months for instance. Allot yourself about $400/week to spend on purchasing bitcoin. Either spend all $400 when you think the market is down for the week, or just setup an automatic purchase of $50 each day. At the end of the three months, you will have a nice btc position, acquired at roughly the average exchange rate over that time period.

Not really, I haven't used it personally. I've heard some good things, and it's more secure than the normal coinbase account, but I prefer to manage everything myself, rather allowing coinbase to hold 1/3 keys. Just a preference I suppose. There's some tradeoff between security and convenience, and I think the vault is probably decently secure and fairly convenient for most people. 
It's my opinion that even if you opt for storing your wealth in the CB vault, you should still know how to store bitcoin using other methods like paper wallets, HD wallet seed, cold storage, etc. Then you can evaluate which option works best for a given scenario. Also keep in mind that you don't necessarily need to select one method. You can spread your btc across multiple storage mediums. For instance, 7btc in the vault, 5 on a few paper wallets, and 2.5 on an encrypted wallet file backed up to cloud storage.

I've noticed this too. It usually goes down before/over the weekend, and usually back up on Monday. If it holds steady from Fri-Sun, you'll almost certainly see a little boost on Monday like we did today. Unless there's news to substantiate the increase, it will probably dwindle back down to 'reasonable' levels.
It's probably due to the fact that even though you can trade 24/7, most people trade from their desks, during normal working hours. On the weekends, most people are probably just busy with other things.

You're right, it is still beta. Although, even when a piece of software makes it out of beta, there can still be plenty of bugs and vulnerabilities that could lead to a loss of funds. So it's really up to the user to make the call for themselves on whether they trust the software enough.

Really depends on why you are buying. If you're speculating, I wouldn't buy either of these, but if I had to pick one it would probably be ETH when the price dips. I don't see much use for LTC other than a bitcoin testbed, at least ETH has some technical innovations going for it. Although i think it's current growth is speculative, and am not sure if it will eventually be worth $1k+. If you're just trying to gamble with a few hundred bucks, you're better off choosing a smaller coin with more upside.

Here's an easy example: somebody might be trying to buy something with a purchase price denominated in USD. They transfer the btc into the platform's wallet, over the next few hours the price shifts, and they are now $3 USD short for the purchase.

No, faucets are a waste of time. I equate the bitcoin faucets of today to those stupid survey sites you see all the time. You waste your time clicking shit and viewing ads to make somebody else money, and then they give you a worthless amount for all your trouble.
There was once a time when faucets existed to incite interest in bitcoin and they weren't filled with ads and captchas and other revenue-generating bullshit. This time has come and gone. Faucets now only exist as another money-grabbing internet scheme.
If you are truly interested in bitcoin, just sign up at coinbase, circle or another place, and buy about $10 worth of btc. Try a bunch of mobile wallets, try a bunch of software wallets, start looking up things on the bitcoin wiki, and go from there.

Also, if you're endgame is to sell, you should make sure you already have an account setup on an exchange (probably several), and be sure to verify the account so that you don't run into issues when you eventually want to sell. Identity verification can take days or weeks, so the last thing you want is be waiting on exchange to verify you before you sell. Protect the exchange account as best you can, e.g. high entropy password, 2FA authentication, PIN, buy/sell limits, etc.

This is a good question. I didn't know the answer, and decided to figure it out. I don't think you can with just the address alone, but you can if you have the redeem script.
Here's the example I created, you can see it gives all 3 addresses and the multisig address as well: 
Also, from what I can tell from using the coinb.in utilities, the same 3 signee-addresses and signature threshold (2of2, 2of3, etc.) should always create the same address, so given the pub key for each address, you should be able to recreate it.

If you're storing the seed unencrypted, that is one way for your setup to be compromised. You should encrypt the file containing your HD seed using truecrypt or some other utility.

Surprising to read this since I thought softcard (formerly isis pay or something) was originally created so the mobile networks could implement their own Google-wallet- type sysyem that they would profit from. I remember wallet being blocked on several different carriers, while their stupid isis thing was promoted. If they would have never blocked their users from using google wallet software, we all would have been making contactless payments 2-3 years before the creation of crApplePay.
The wireless service industry operates on such a fucked up business model. It would be like ISPs telling you which type of software you can run on your computer. Or if you buy a computer on Comcast, you can't use it with AT&amp;T. No other market operates like that.

Interesting idea. I think a better approach would be to have a list of charities, and let users select which ones they would like to donate to. I think that would be a better, more personalized option.
What were your thoughts on the user interface for this service? Basically, how will I make the donations to the pool of selected charities? Will I have to login to your site, or can I simply send BTC to a specified address?
I think it would be cool if you could allow users to create accounts, then select which charities they want to support (maybe even choose different percentages for each company). From there, your service could create a personalized donation address where any btc received will be forwarded to the selected charities. Then, any time I want to make a contribution, I can just send btc to the donation address.
One issue I see with this is transparency. Since you're forwarding the payments on behalf of the contributor, one must be able to verify that any donated funds did, in fact, reach the proper destination. In addition, following along the system I've proposed, I think it would be helpful to allow other users to check which charities are associated with a specific address. I think that would be an easy feature to add to the main website.
Also, will you support donations to charities who do not accept bitcoin? I could see that integrated with the system proposed above, however you may run into issues with transparency on the fiat side of things.

Good points. About the Trezor; that may be true, however the Trezor displays transaction information for the user to confirm before sending.

daytrading bitcoin is basically gambling. No, it *is* gambling. I wouldn't advise doing it. If you're that compelled to the trading aspect of it, you should look into some sites that let you daytrade with playmoney. Do that for 2-4 weeks and if you're seeing solid gains, maybe drop in $250 onto a legit exchanges and see where it takes you (read: how long it takes to loose it all). Or just buy $250 btc which is enough of a risk in itself.

Bitcoin is a HIGH risk asset. A wise investor would evaluate their tolerance for risk, and then structure an investment portfolio to reflect that.
With that said, based on the questions you've asked, you should probably do a lot more research.

I find it helpful to try and remove the conventional comparison to a physical 'coin'. The mechanism is more accurately conveyed by explaining bitcoin as a system of digital credits or points, instead of referring to everything with the 'coin' moniker. People who have zero previous exposure to digital forms of money tend to look for similarities and draw assumptions from monetary systems they already know - which means that infinitely divisible, digital 'coins' is inherently confusing.

Different groups of people want to experiment with different aspects of the technology. For example, some may be of the opinion that a greater number of total coins may be better. Others want to play with things like demurrage to influence spending of the currency. There are many many aspects that can be altered. Other coins are designed for different uses other than currency, Namecoin being one of the most notable. Other seek to peg crypto value to a fiat currency value, like nuBits or BitUSD, Tether, and others.
Overall, I believe these other currencies are a great thing. It allows things to be tested, and if something is found that would make sense to add to bitcoin, it is possible for it to be added, or incorporated as a metalayer 
on top of existing bitcoin code. 
We have to be careful to not adopt a close-minded bitcoin-only mindset. It's entirely possible for a better system to be designed. If that happens, we would be stupid to stay attached to our bitcoins, like some sort of inadaptable religion beliefs.

What type of device is it? If it's an android phone, you should be careful if it's rooted, since a malicious application would possibly be able to take advantage of those increased permissions.

That's correct; it is an effective way to mitigate short-term volatility and to enter a position without exposing oneself to those daily up's and downs.
If you're truly long on btc, I would discourage contemplating 'what-ifs' about such small price rises. To be honest, anything could happen at any time, and you need to accept that possibility. At the moment, a $150 increase is fairly substantial, however if bitcoin reaches a 'critical mass' $150 is nearly insignificant. So if you're looking at a 5 year investment horizon, and you're bullish on btc, you could really just purchase today without much worry about dollar cost averaging into your position.
Of course this is all my perspective, and I'm heavily pro-bitcoin. Your reply earlier hinted that you're capable of making decisions for yourself, and I commend you for that, so this disclaimer is likely unnecessary :)

They are, without a doubt. Andreas talks about it frequently; the software has been under constant attack since it's creation and it still has not been broken, despite potentially billion dollar reward for compromising the system (Though actually breaking bitcoin would likley severely collapse its value and leave the 'hacker' with a bunch of near-worthless assets)
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:17:23
Nope, this analogy is not applicable to bitcoin namely because there is no network effect in supplements. There is no inherent benefit or disadvantage to using a brand of supplement that other people are using. Additionally, the analogy doesn't account for differences in security. Sure,  anyone can create a copy of bitcoin, but it's blockchain is likely more susceptible to compromise compared to bitcoin due to bitcoin's comparatively large user base.

No, unless the hack reveals that the address generation algo was not sufficiently random. Or if the hacker modified the code in some way. I believe all the scripting is run client-side, so the servers would't have knowledge of the keys that get generated. However, if your computer has been compromised, then your private key (and the rest of your various login credentials) might be vulnerable.   
This is a type of question :)

Public transaction ledger allows all activity to be audited. Anyone could check for themselves where money from a specific account was sent. For instance, if the Pentagon utilized bitcoin for their finances, anyone with an internet connection could view their account, and see where money was sent. That's assuming their address is made public somehow.
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:57:38
That is a good point. If you're known to be wealthy, revealing a paltry 1btc isn't going to satisfy your adversary. It might help you from a legal standpoint though, where the prosecution would need to actually prove something; but it's no match for private actor.

Send them some bitcoin? Theres some good video resources on youTube, search this subreddit and plenty should pop up
Maybe the community should create some kind of interactive bitcoin course, where new users could walkthrough all the basic steps of wallet creation, 2FA, multi-sig, etc. without actually creating accounts or anything. Basically like an interactive tutorial video that shows everything you would see in normal use, but guides you through each step and provides some explanation in the process.

You seem level-headed, and better researched than most; so I think you'll probably be fine no matter how you proceed. If you're looking to get in, but can't figure out when's a good time, I would suggest to consider entering your position through dollar-cost averaging; buying a small amount each day/week/month, over a period of time. For instance, if you wanted to acquire 1btc, you could buy .1btc every Monday, for the next 10 weeks. This way you limit your exposure to large price swings
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:28:52
Well...it doesn't quite adhere to the specific example in this case, but it is generally applicable in the sense that there can be a more pragmatic method of breaking encryption that's not initially accounted for in one's theoretical security analysis. I think the overall lesson is that you have to consider a multitude of factors in your security model for it to be effective; including those which are not conventional methods of attack, for instance the threat of violence if a password is not provided, or the simple snatching of the laptop.

Such is the nature of irreversible transactions.
It provides benefit both ways: 
* Merchants accepting BTC do not have to worry about chargebacks, and other paypal-style reversals. 
* At the same time, the irreversible nature of the currency lends itself to those using it for fraudulent purposes because the victim has no recourse to obtain their stolen funds, the same phenomenon we see with fiat cash.

Yeah, the ATMs would be pretty much taking BitInstant's whole market. I can't see another purpose for an intermediary service like that, except maybe to transfer funds between the different exchanges?
BitInstant's made an absolute shitload of cash this past year, they'd be smart to start innovating another space in the bitcoin world, or even coming up with additional services they could provide that could be offered in conjunction with the ATM

An alternative to mining bitcoins with a PS3, you could look into building a mining rig using gpus but it still wont get you much btc.

1. No, you need to connect to the network in some way in order for the transaction to be propagated. If you don't have network connectivity, there are ways to push transactions via SMS, and I believe some type of radio-transmission is being worked on.
2. The phrase "Bitcoin 2.0" sort of refers to technologies built on top of the existing bitcoin infrastructure. If you mean how is the core software updated and improved, it is open source and contributions can be made by the community.
3. It depends on how you want to implement this. You could use the existing protocol to tally votes amongst a group of people, but there are other technologies being developed on top of bitcoin to carry out this task a bit smoother.

Current mining methods will earn you squat once all the ASICs hit the market.

If you really wanted to mine, you could look into an alternative cryptocurrency like LTC which would earn you more for your investment.

Well, if you weren't willing to take a loss you shouldn't have invested in such a volatile commodity.

Or you could hold, and potentially break even, gain some value, or loose it all.

Yes you can, just make sure you place them in the proper directory wherever you are transferring them to. I believe its under AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin or a similar path.
When you run the wallet software on the destination machine, it will update the blockchain from wherever you left off up to it's current state, then it will scan for the transactions like it usually does when you load the application

Not necessarily. An address is just an address, it's not necessarily linked with an identity. So unless the mixing service uses the same address for every deposit, I think you'd be fine.
If you're really worried, consider using an exchange to sell your btc, buy another cryptocurrency like ltc, then sell it back for btc. Fresh coins.

Wow, that really sucks. Everyday I read one or two stories just like yours, and become more and more paranoid about my own Bitcoin assets. 
Just curious about a couple things related to your situation:
Before the unauthorized activities, when was the last time you had logged in to your account?
Had you ever generated any api keys for your account? Check your security settings to see if any keys are currently active?
Which browser are you using, and also which OS?
Which antivirus, malware scanner, ect. are you using?
I'm also guessing that that 171.xx IP is not yours correct? Verify this if you're not sure, just go google "whats my ip" or something along those lines.
I'll probably have a few more to add, but these are good to start :)

@_date: 2013-05-14 03:59:48
My hypothesis is that you may have clicked on a link containing some malicious code at some point, which could have created the api without your permission.
Or, possibly more likely since you mentioned something about recently attempting some remote stuff, they could have used a vulnerability in the software , firewall, network security, open ports, or any number of things that are exposed through enabling your computer to be accessed remotely.
Either way, now that they're gone, I would definitely reccomend you store your future bitcoins in paper wallets, in which the private key is never seen by an online computer. That's probably the best way to hold any significant holdings. 
Also, I would look into some different browser extensions that will help lock you down against those certain types of java script hacks and injection type attacks. I believe noScripts or something along those lines would help, as well as a few others would definitely help you out
I'd also look into a good firewall outside of window's default one, or making very sure it's well configured to avoid unauthorized access to your machine.
And last but not least, perhaps the most helpful thing in combination with the browser additions would be using a Linux OS, at least for transacting BTC. Setup is very easy, and a live usb would allow you to bring a live, safe environment with you for use on otherwise questionable computers
Good luck :)

I can't say anything about their fees vs Dwolla, but I've been recommending BitInstant to people.
It's what I use myself, and the funds will hit your Mt.Gox account within minutes of deposit.
I use the Moneygram to MtGox account feature, then I purchase the BTC at whatever price I choose once the funds are in my account.
Very easy, probably the fastest method, but there is a fee I can't remember exactly how much

Working great every time for me. I would definitely recommend doing cash to mt.gox account though, all problems I've heard have been with direct to BTC
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:34:48
I ordered one with the same intentions.
It's still useful to login to blockchain.info, or BTCT.co, and others if you still use those.
Another way you could implement it with Mt.Gox would be to change your Mt.Gox password to include the yubikey's static password.
Set the static pass to like 50 characters or even more if you'd like (i think it goes up to 200 max), copy down the info yubikey uses to generate it (just in case). 
Then when you reset your gox password, make it something like this: "apple corn flour sdfn8834bbf8b3jkwbf923r89*gf/g-3" where the last section of random characters is generated by your yubikey. Just make sure you hold the button for a few seconds so it doesn't give you the OTP
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:32:50
On a more serious note:
Do you have an idea of how many characters it could be? Like from 5-10 characters, or potentially more? If it's a relatively small number, you could build a dedicated computer to bruteforce the password using GPUs to speed up the processing.
It might take several months or even a year though.

The scenario of being robbed at gunpoint exists for anything of value, why are Bitcoins special? For instance, if you have a safe full of gold and cocaine at home, a thief could potentially break in, point a gun at you and demand you to open the safe and relinquish your treasure.

Well just looking at the charts, the prices at btc-e and gox are the same currently in the 29 area. Usually they differ more than that, but lately I've been noticing their prices growing closer to one another
It can be profitable, the fees you incur at each step in the process may make it not worth it. You can see gains, but the difference in price between markets has to be significant.
It's not easy currently to deposit USD at btc-e either, especially on a repetitive basis.
Some say that mt.gox accepting litecoin will enhance the ability to shuttle funds between the two exchanges, making arbitrage somewhat easier
@_date: 2013-07-19 18:16:30
I personally do not, but many others have with success.

That's exactly what friedcat wants you to think.
I agree though about helping the network, and the collectable perspective. However the price of BTC would have to rise quite a bit to make mining with these feasible. 
From mining.thegenesisblock.com, the BlockErupter USB is predicted to make .01 BTC per month in Nov and Dec, and much less in the following months. So if BTC becomes worth $1,000 USD in Dec '13, you could expect to make a cool $10 each month.

You should buy BTC, then transfer it to an offline account, or an account which you hold full control over. No need to let somebody else hold your money if a more secure, almost as convenient option is available.

Not sure what to tell you, maybe try and use the card as part of a trade on localbitcoins?
Other than that, with the current state of BitInstant, there's not a lot of non-bank related ways to get fiat into BTC, to my knowledge.
Or you could try and sell the gift card for BTC on something like BitMit.net maybe?

200 full shares, or 20,000 PT shares
Each PT share gets about .0002, x20,000 shares = 4btc
But keep in mind the dividends can fluctuate depending on the companies activities/sales/etc
At that BTC rate/share price, you'd be investing about 750btc or $75k give or take

This is how you know that the market's current reliance on a single exchange is a very bad thing.

The Bitcoin ATM will no doubt bring some decentralization, but people would still use exchanges in order to trade for profits, and use of automatic trading software.
It would change the market though, because most people would not be required to use the exchange to obtain BTC or USD

Haha, no problem.
Fontas is some idiot who has a small following in the cryptocurrency community. He posts on twitter when he's pumping a certain currency, or when he's gonna dump it and pretty much just cons people into trading for his own profit.
At least that's what I've gathered so far. :)
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:32:03
PM'd you about and issue I'm having with this
@_date: 2013-07-24 04:26:15
I think we (as a community) need to avoid being too propaganda-ey. It might work in some ways to spread the message, but it can also keep people from adopting it, for the simple fact that they are put off by propaganda.
That said, Bitcoin should definitely be marketed and talked about, albeit in a more open, and less in your face type of manner.
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:02:16
Too late? No, but you may not see a such a nice return on your initial investment.
With the waiting list so long, and how things are looking at BFL currently, you may want to wait and see what happens.
Or you could consider investing your money into mining an alternative cryptocurrency, which would net you a bit more return in comparison to BTC
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:10:10
Yeah... fuck PayPal and eBay too. Just use BitMit or coingig or the forums to sell your bitcoin stuff.

Welcome to Bitcoin, but:


@_date: 2013-09-06 03:29:24
How much did you make again?
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:33:20
Yeah, that would be no problem as long as you have the private key, you just have to import the address into the wallet
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:50:14
Yes, haha that was precisely why I was asking.
That said, I like your idea, and wish you the best of luck. From what you say, it sounds like you have some good ideas, and the Bitcoin community could certainly benefit from a little competition, instead of the same 2 companies claiming all the business
Additionally, supporting Litecoin alone would certainly bring you a great deal of business by itself. To my knowledge, no such BitInstant-for-litecoin-esque service currently exists, and their community would definitely embrace a new, trustworthy company emerging in this space
@_date: 2013-05-14 19:42:07
I follow the same methods as you guys, but I'm wondering what the purpose of the presigned transaction would be?

Thanks for pointing this out, I was not aware this was the case.
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:44:14
I think some people would advise you to make sure you trust the website you generate the wallets and print the addresses from. Additionally, there could be some malware on your machine that has the capability to capture screenshots, in which case the security of your securely generated paper wallets would be compromised.
Best way, from what I've read, is to download the source of one of the paper wallet generating sites, like bitaddress.org or you can download the brainwallet source. Then, boot a live linux usb while disconnected from the  internet and generate and print your addresses from there. 
That's what I did yesterday, and as far as I know that would be the most secure method of generating them.
May seem over the top, but you can never be too careful storing money, especially if you're working with large amounts of coin
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:05:46
Ahhh I thought that may be the case.
@_date: 2013-08-16 18:49:15
You should lower your price then. Coinbase is currently &lt;$100, so I think most people would choose that over transacting with you.
Consider a more attractive price point. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:14:30
I would do this, but I think this post is against the rules.
Also, it could be some kinda scam where you dispute the transaction after you get the bitcoin. Or, perhaps the paypal funds are stolen or otherwise illicit.

@_date: 2013-07-24 06:14:13
Ahhh, okayy I see. I thought you were saying that you could see the trades being made as they happen. For instance, find a guy holding a bunch of shares, and you could watch his address and see when he sells, or buys
and if such a thing doesnt exist, would it be possible to build one using the JSON Asset data, that would show you changes as they occur......

@_date: 2013-07-24 05:58:58
You mention that with bitcoin securities, anyone can see at any time who the largest shareholders are, and how many shares they have at any given moment.
Where can I view this? I know about the Assets List on bitfunder, but as far as I can tell, that only shows me the shares held by each account
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:46:39
Yeah, I've noticed that people around here are very quick to conclude foul play.

 I might try this out. How do I know it won't just drain my gox account or something though?

@_date: 2013-10-02 17:48:56
Was thinking about this earlier. However, I am wondering what the decentralized solution would be to provide transaction feedback. I think this was one of great features SilkRoad, and other legit eCommerce sites as well.
Something like a web of trust of sorts, but that would also reveal who's transacted with whom, and could turn out to be incriminating if the users behind the usernames are ever revealed...
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:38:22
Holy shit, watching the charts at work and all the sudden we go from 124 straight down to 108 right now.

edit: damn somebody just made at least $20k
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:50:10
Chill, it happens.
They have to cover their ass from a legal perspective, and the automated system is the only way to do that while processing transactions swiftly.
I'll tell ya, Coinbase is pretty awesome. Granted, I've never encountered a similar situation. However when things run as they should, this is an outstanding service.
I would encourage you to call their customer support, and explain your situation, hopefully they can get things smoothed out for you.
If that doesn't pan out, be assured that there exist many ways to obtain BTC, this is just one avenue. I would implore you to do some research into other services and venues in which to obtain Bitcoin, as relying on one service alone can prove detrimental in such a dynamic market where businesses are opening and being shutdown seemingly every day.
Good luck.
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:58:35

My pleasure. Ive been reading lots about Litecoin lately, cryptocurrency is some interesting stuff
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:30:54
Oh, easy as pie then. Just log-in to your compromised wallet via blockchain.info or whatever you happen to use. Then just place a Send transaction using the address you want the funds to go to.
Be careful. Your account was compromised somehow so I would be leary of any machines I had previously logged into that account with.
I personally boot into linux whenever I get start getting paranoid about all me coins. So relatively often.
@_date: 2013-08-21 00:55:33
If you're long term, paper wallet is probably the best way. I would be extra safe and back up the paper copy somewhere online too even, you can never be too safe. Then keep a few coins in a hot wallet with blockchain.info for spending of course. 
I would also copy backups to more places then just dropbox. Make sure they're encrypted
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:39:22
Yes, I like this approach. Obviously it would need to be more thought out, but i think something like this would be the most logical decentralized option.
Also, not sure if you saw this, but you were quoted in an BusinessInsider article: 
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:28:11
BitInstant was great, purchased my very first BTCs from them. But there are definitely other services that rival their ease of use. 
Using BitInstant, I have to create the order, then drive to WalMart and send the cash. BTCs hit the wallet in minutes; not too bad.
But using something like Coinbase, I have to log in and click buy. BTCs hit the wallet basically instantly, and I didn't even have to move. Sweet deal.
That being said, I'm still very excited for BitInstant to come back. I'm hoping they introduce some new features and services, and the competition will only drive other services to get better. Even sweeter deal.
When BitInstant reopens their doors, I expect the price will climb pretty significantly. I think there's currently a very high demand for BTCs, but I think many people who aren't in the tech world, and even some who are, struggle with how to obtain them.
@_date: 2013-07-27 21:08:26
Yay, mine looks the same. Received it about 4 days after opening the account.
@_date: 2013-07-30 18:43:03
I'm confused. So I buy 5 BTC on Virtex for $90 each, total $450 send em to Gox and sell for $105, total $525. So now I have $525 on gox.
I'm confused now. At this point I have $525 on gox, and no BTC...right? So then you say post an ad on btctalk for $108, accepting bank transfer as the payment method? 
Are you saying to then wait to receive the transfer, then when it hits your account, buy coins on virtex, and sell them to your buyer?
@_date: 2013-07-24 16:24:43
Perhaps for *you*, as the connotation of a word can differ from person to person.
However, I don't believe the general claim that the word "propaganda" carries a negative connotation is a false one. Propaganda can exist in a positive sense, without it's negative connotations, however the use of the word in a modern context often conveys a pejorative connotation. 
See here:

Hahaha, I wasn't too serious... but maybe it's worth a shot. I doubt you will just randomly remember the password one day, so you might as well go for it and hope a nice person is able to get it open.

I recently purchased BTC through bitinstant using a cash deposit at my local walmart.
Super easy, it hit my account within 10 minutes, and you don't need to wait for Mt.Gox to verify you
There are some fees, but well worth it. I paid $100 cash, and $96 USD went into my Mt.Gox account where I could then make a BTC purchase at whatever exchange rate I wanted
@_date: 2013-05-14 19:35:56
In addition to 2FA, BlockChain.info offers the option to set a secondary password, used when sending funds or making account changes.
This password is asked for each time you initiate a send transaction.
However, it still faces the same weaknesses as your other passwords - if you are keylogged or similar, your passwords may still be compromised
@_date: 2013-07-24 04:31:24
Depending on the site, you can copy the source and run the page on an offline machine.
Technically, this assumes you trust the code and the integrity of the random number generation, etc.
I would advise using a well known and heavily used site with no reported issues. I use brainwallet.org, and also BitAddress.org
Others are listed here:

ScriptSafe is the NoScript equivalent for Chrome, I believe.
The only problem I've had using it, is that some websites don't function properly until I realize that I have to add them to the trusted sites. Never realized how much script is being used on basically every website
@_date: 2013-07-24 05:15:17
Nope, not at all. I like the t-shirts for the most part.
All I'm saying is things that come off as being too propaganda-like can be distasteful at times and cause people to have an aversion to adopting such a "radical" concept. I've seen this several times around Reddit, and other places as well.
The word propaganda carries negative connotation. By definition, propaganda is "information of a **biased** or **misleading** nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view." I don't think that's the best way to promote Bitcoin, because it's ideals speak for themselves. There's no need to be biased or misleading, the benefits are evident. If we simply create a good discussion, people will adopt it without needing to be mislead. The t-shirts help create this discussion.
I wasn't making a statement about this site in particular, rather voicing a more general opinion of "Bitcoin propaganda".
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:19:20
No, LTC uses Scrypt instead of BTC's SHA256, so different hardware would be needed. One of the touted advantages of LTC is that it is incompatible with ASICs and more friendly towards easier mining methods

Ability to spend it without conversion, universal acceptance.
Also political factors, such as governments/banks collapsing, or even the fear of such things happening - think Cyprus, Greece, and others
Anything leading to fiat currency devaluation
Also e-commerce issues like PayPal fees are driving consumers to adopt an alternative payment method.

I was actually looking for the same thing about 10 minutes ago...
then I wound up just using my CC to purchase from the Yubico website.
With all the recent security breaches, I think this would be a great time to encourage the folks over at Yubico to accept BTC as payment. Security and Bitcoin go hand in hand, and I would bet that they see a huge increase in sales after accepting BTC.
I just sent an email over to their sales department, we'll see if they reply at all.
Here's their contact emails, incase anybody else would like to do the same:

It seems that in every BitInstant problem thread I've seen lately, the problem seems to come only in USD to BTC wallet transactions.
I did a USD to Mt.Gox account transfer, and it worked flawlessly and in hit my account in minutes. Not sure if people aren't aware you can do this or if they're just trying to boycott the major exchange or something, but this method seems to be much easier, much faster, and much safer from what I can tell. Using this method, you don't need a verified account either.
Either way, I'm glad to hear your transaction finally went, hopefully as their demand keeps ramping up they develop a better support system.

Its a random number lottery type thing. It picks a number between 0 and 65,535. You choose where you think the number will be: below 56,000, below 24,000 - then send your bet to the corresponding address. Then it will calculate and send you either your winnings, or if you lose, a very small return percentage.
It was on the fritz a few days ago, but working fine now as far as I know.

@_date: 2013-10-02 18:55:27
Depends on what the word seized really means in this context.
They may have seized the hard drives on which the information is stored, however we all know that if the drives were encrypted and backups exist, and the private keys still exist, then the coins are not actually in government possession; merely encrypted data.

Ahhh I was wondering how to do this, I'll have a look - thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:52:43
About 3 or 4 days ago I believe, and I plan to do a larger deposit again this weekend as long as nothing crazy happens between now and then haha
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:54:04
Yeah if you convert to USD, the amount stays the same regardless of the  price of BTC. Your buying power can be increased/reduced when purchasing BTC using USD, but if you withdrew the cash it would be the same
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:52:49
This was pretty much my thinking. I just wanted to dabble in it a bit before getting too invested.
I used bitinstant to depost $100 cash from my local walmart to my mt.gox account. Super easy - took not even 15 minutes to go through.
After the fee's I think I had about $96 and some change in my account. Not bad at all
If you didn't want to put in as much you could easily do $25 or something, but the fee's would be about the same I believe so you might be better off putting a little bit more
@_date: 2013-07-29 15:45:49
Why do you need the licensure and registration? Or even the bank account?
All you need to accept BTC is a valid address. To incorporate it into your website or game or something you should be able to use some existing e-commerce solution, like bitpay or something along those lines depending on how you want to integrate it
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:47:02
Haha I'm kicking myself right now because I can't deposit any cash till after work, and by then it will probably be back to 140's again. Ughhhhhhhh

I just did it anyways, and changed my password afterwards. 
Seems legit.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:10:36
Did you use the proper form (Blue, Express i think?) 
I did the same exact thing as you about a week ago, and paid no MoneyGram fee's. I think there was a $3.50 ZipZap fee, plus an Mt.Gox transfer fee. 
After everything I wound up handing over a $100 bill at wal-mart, and about $96 USD in my Mt.Gox account about 20-30 minutes later.

If you let random comments deter you from doing something you want to do, you should probably keep your weak hands off the markets.
People may have their opinions, but I'd like to see you take $2 and do something with it on any conventional stock exchange. One of the best things about these virtual exchanges is that it eliminates the huge barrier to entry that exists within the conventional financial industry.
The investments are risky though, you should really do your research.

So do you have the wallet file, correct?
Upload it and post a link, maybe somebody will be able to crack it and return the coins
Edit: Saw the picture - you do have the wallet file.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:45:24
That's what I first thought, but they do not. Make sure you include the 0 before the decimal and you should be fine purchasing fractional BTC.
I purchased less than 0.5 BTC my first time with MtGox
Do you have USD in your gox account? Try it, bet it works :)
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:52:48
Gox is poop.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:08:07
Ahh I thought so. Yeah, I've heard of others with similar problems. That's why I opted for using the service to deposit usd to mt.gox, then purchase BTC from there at whatever price I see fit.
@_date: 2013-07-26 19:00:36
I'm speaking of the FastHash, produced by VirtualMiningCo

To solve this could you use a live linux usb to generate a paper wallet, then back up those keys and encrypt the file while on linux then back the file up to cloud storage?

As long as the QR code is scannable from, say... 10 feet. 
Similar in concept to those Shazam icons you see these days on commercials, which is really just a glorified way to access the companies website, without typing anything in. But the shazam part keeps you from having to walk up to the tv to scan the QR code, or other problems that may go along with that

Gyft is the bomb.
I only wish it would let me create gift cards with specific dollar amounts, like $25.89, instead of only $10, $15, $25, etc. because then I am left with weird amounts which may not be enough to buy something with. The classic gift card dilemma...
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:52:05
Very nice, sounds like you're good to go then
@_date: 2013-08-31 11:42:10
I don't think it matters if it's an individual or business doing the conversion. If you're converting over a certain dollar amount, you'd be required to do some KYC (know your customer) paper work.
Pretty sure that individuals can get MSB licensing for a few thousand dollars. I think I've read people talking about that on  but I can't be 100% sure. 
You could pop in there and ask, I'm sure they could help or point you in the right direction.
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:17:16
Look up the address and see if it has had any prior transactions. 
If it has, then try sending a satoshi to the address and add a short note to the transaction with your request. You can use the blockchain.info client to include messages in the transaction, not sure about other clients.
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:07:22
From my experience, BitInstant works great when you do cash to Mt.Gox account, then buy the BTC from there.
The only problems I've heard of have only come from USD to BTC wallet transfers.
For what it's worth, I've read about those transfers working successfully too, just seems to have more people posting about problems.
BitInstant has an account on here, and they post from time to time. From my experience contacting them, it seemed that they had pretty decent customer service
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:33:56
Uh oh, I definitely know that feeling. Maybe check out the wal-mart reciepts and the carbon copy and make sure all account  and info is correct.
Best of luck, hopefully your funds appear soon  
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:57:30
It's all about your machine. Many of the recent heists have used some browser vulnerabilities to gain access to bitcoin credentials.
I would ensure that your browser is secure from malicious scripts using NoScripts or ScriptStop or something similar
I would not use windows, as there are many vulnerabilities that come along with that OS
Look into using offline storage using armory as well for additional security
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:58:04
This seems really cool, very innovative concept.
Can you give an example(s) of situations in which this would be of use?
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:00:55
I like it - it sounds like a good idea that could prove to be a popular alternative to other offline storage methods. Especially with all the thefts/exploits/etc thats been going on lately
I'd definitely use it
@_date: 2013-07-19 17:42:31
LocalBitcoins works. Probably as anonymous as it gets
@_date: 2013-07-22 23:53:19
Couldn't the person accepting payment just verify the address contains the correct amount of BTC, then using the priv key, sweep the address-transferring the coins to a secure wallet? I think you'd have to do that for a Casacius Coin too 
@_date: 2013-08-08 20:31:36
People dont want trade BTC for PP because PayPal can claw back charges up to 180 days i believe.
Since btc is irreversible, you could hypothetically transact with somebody, wait a month and then do a chargeback

There's only a few to choose from:
* Direct shares issued by friedcat
* Bitfunder
* Havelock Investments
* BTCT.co
Of those: Direct shares, expensive, too much effort to acquire
Bitfunder lists several pass throughs, but requires you to transfer the funds through WeExchange so I eliminated that one - too much effort for me but this is nothing against the exchange
I have not used Havelock, but they only offer TAT's pass through shares. It is run by a user by the name of lightbox, I believe? (on BitcoinTalk.org) This is probably the newest exchange to offer AM shares, but I've heard good things so far
BTCT.co is the one that I personally chose. They have 2 passthroughs to choose from, one is full shares and the other is 1/100 shares so you have some options. The exchange is run by Burnside, a well known member of bitcointalk.org, and also owner of ltc-global I believe.
@_date: 2013-07-24 05:45:16
Could you clarify for me what the difference is between what you're building and this:

The price of it goes down. So while you hold it and get div's you  will wind up selling it for less than you paid.
I would move that 16btc into something that can get you a better gain. 16btc ActM shares at .0050 last week, you could have doubled your money
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:43:55
I haven't used it in a while but there should be an option to export private keys or something along those lines. There will be several private keys to choose from, 1 for each address in your wallet. You don't have to import every one, just the one from the wallet you want to control
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:58:19
Yeah, thats pretty stupid and also the reason I chose not to use BitFunder.
Just use BTCT.co - they accept direct BTC deposits, and the exchange is also run by Burnside who is very active on the BitcoinTalk forums, and also owner of LTC-GLOBAL I believe. Seems legit
@_date: 2013-07-22 23:50:13

I've heard good things about Bitcoin businesses using the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union.
I just signed up for an account with them last week, and just got the card in the mail. I haven't transacted with them yet so I can't really speak to any other aspect of their business, but it seems good so far and I've heard that they are working on ways to work with Bitcoin.

Were you planning to purchase more BTC and use a different address, or are you getting out of the bitcoin game now?
Even if BTC was at $500/each, you'd have the equivalent of about $0.13 USD on your hands.
I say donate it either to a charitable org, or to somebody on here who's developed some software, useful website, etc.
@_date: 2013-08-16 19:04:18
I would only worry about large deposits. Not sure where you're located, but I believe deposits in excess of $10k must be reported in the US, which would require you filling out that paper work and shit. Any account with an excess of $10k in transactions over a 24hr period must file this paperwork. Find out what the number is exactly, and make your deposits strategically less than that. Be aware that algorithms are used to catch people trying to bypass this policy using "structuring". 
Depositing cash into an account from different places all over the country will probably get your account flagged eventually. I would be careful to not keep much additional money in the account, incase it gets frozen for some reason.

API keys are a feature within Mt.Gox that grants an application access to your account. When you create them, you can choose which privileges they key will have access to (get info, trade, deposit, withdraw, merchant) allowing you to create one that can be used to do everything you normally could by logging into the account regularly.
Many people use the API key feature to enable their trading bots/software to access the account. **Using the API access, the software is allowed to bypass any 2FA, secondary password, etc.**
Recently, somebody said that they noticed an API key generated on their account. Which would mean somebody gained access to their account, then generated the key, then copied the key information - which then allows them access to the Mt.Gox account without going through any other authentication.
How to spot them: go into your account settings, then Security Center. Click on current API keys at the bottom to see if there are any active keys.
I'd recommend making sure you're running a browser extension to block scripts like ScriptSafe. I also downloaded Ghostery today at the advice of another member here.

This is a great idea. We need to get some support behind this.
So far, to my knowledge, the IAFCU is the only institution in the conventional banking industry that has expressed interest in working with Bitcoin customers. 
Raising funds to help with the additional expenses incurred from supporting Bitcoin based businesses would undoubtedly be a phenomenal display of good faith from the community, especially since they incurred these costs without thought of being reimbursed.
Helping IAFCU support the fallout from the Bitfloor fiasco would no doubt encourage their further support of the Bitcoin community.
I opened my account with them last week, and it was quite a pleasant experience in comparison to the typical US banking experience I've become accustomed to.
It is my hope that with more displays of community support, such as this donation campaign, we can hopefully see a more seamless integration between BTC and USD in IAFCU accounts.

Lol this is part of what makes bitcoin so interesting to me. You can see literally every transaction that takes place, yet you know  absolutely nothing about them.
I have the same thoughts all the time, yet I've realized at this point that they are essentially futile, and only lead me to be frustrated at the fact that I don't have thousands and thousands of BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:42:08
I've heard several users state that their bank accounts have been closed or flagged after using them to transfer funds/receive funds from bitcoin related services.
Is this something you're worried about?
Thinking about how to go from BTC --&gt; $$$ --&gt; ATM, I came up with a similar method as the one you are using. However, instead of using my 'normal' bank account, I was considering using an account with Ally bank or CapitalOne360 or really any other bank as long as it's not the one I use for my day to day fiat transactions. That way, in the event of an issue, my daily banking necessities would not be impacted.
Just my thoughts for others to consider, though I'm not sure if this is any better than your method though
@_date: 2013-07-23 15:38:28

I see what you're saying. And it's true that the processing power would help further scientific research.
But, you have to consider that many people purchased their bitcoin mining hardware to *mine bitcoins* aka make money. So it makes sense to think about their usage in terms of how much money will be generated.
So now you're asking them to take the hardware that they bought with the intention of making money with, and use it to give away their money.
While it would be a nice thing to do, it's certainly not morally reprehensible to not do so.
Using our mining hardware for charitable purposes is supererogatory, it is not our duty.
