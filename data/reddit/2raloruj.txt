Doubt that. Swift will probably make some kind of their own coin sooner or later. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:51:36
One of my favorites is buying or going long at the ATH ����‍♂️
Thanks for the advice though
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:06:06
Lol. My case ��
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:36:42
Hala Madrid ✌��
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:04:11
When selling btc. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:13:48
Ok. I won’t. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:36:01
Definitely switching to hodling mode after i recover my losses around $1.5k (my stupid ass been day trading). Goddamn xrp burnt me a little bit. But yes, not worth the stress. Hodl is the only way. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:30:00
It will as soon as there is a case with money laundering or terrorism financing. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:51:35
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:49:40
I tried to do that with the asian exchanges. There can be 5-6% profit. However, the same 5-6% you’re gonna be paying in fees to the asian exchange (deposits &amp; withdrawals) 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:45:20
I have a similar issue, where jaxx shows transactions on iphone app and not in mac app. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:29:27
Not that easy due to the fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:03:51
Isn’t this already a dip? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:18:50
Классный ник ��
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:25:22
Using jaxx. Chose it over exodus because it has an ios app. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:26:48
No. Less than that
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:25:36
No shit
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:03:45
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:50:42
The only thing is, cex is currently experiencing problems with deposits/withdrawals. Gotta check on it later again. 
Thanks for the info m8
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:30:09
Tried to do that with chinese exchanges. Fees are too high. End up with no profit. Maybe even loss
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:41:23
Me too
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:43:37
Or down. Who knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:08:08
That was a facepalm question ����‍♂️ 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:30
Cex.io as well
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:50:38
Whenever you’ve decided to go for a long term hodl mode
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:35:26
Haven’t lost until i close the position i guess 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:22:33
Try cex.io or iqoption.com
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:37:16
Guess i’ll do the same. Just wait. Rollover fees are not that high.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:30:22
The spread isn’t always 2k. I guess if you time it right, maybe could be possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:02:40
Share a picture
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:19:19
Try jaxx. Pretty convenient 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:32:36
When? In your IMHO
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:16:12
The dips only happen after you already buy in:) So just buy in and wait. It’s a badass bull run. Got a long position with leverage open myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:40:26
I liked the last part
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:43:52
Short it
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:39:13
Why not use credit card deposit, kardesim? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:34:36
Feels awesome to finally be free from loans. Best feeling:) 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:51:49
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:15:29
I bought at 17,358. Fuck it. Only option is to hodl i guess. ����‍♂️
fyi: using cex.io
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:40:41
The motherfucker better go back the fuck up!!! Have a long position with leverage open!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:57:51
I did the same (long), but, right before the dip ����‍♂️ still can’t catch it. The dip
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:35:01
Come on, my brother. Come on. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:59:49
Tried to do that. Fees are high. Best case scenario - end up breakeven. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:18:15
Красава ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:37:44
Screw the day trading. Way too stressful 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:15:23
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:57:39
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:02:18
Same here. Got a long. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:39:49
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:30:42
Yep. And cex
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:40:38
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:49:05
Update: closed the short position. Opened a long one this time. Recovered 25% of loss so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:37:51
Strange. My cc got verified in several minutes.
Is it a US cc?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:14:05
Could. Gonna be ready to short the bastard as well. Not a hodler. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:24:37
Even underage, you were still able to open the account? If so, then you should be to restore it as well. Talk to the support. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:38:41
I use jaxx both on ios and os. Works for me. Just make sure to back up.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:53:33
Which one? Odin?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:52:12
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:36
Wondering if i’ll ever be able to buy the fucking dip on time.. ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:10:42
I used $ for leverage. Not coins. Sorry
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:24:41
If it starts going down fast, exchanges and etc won’t be able to handle the amount of transactions, which will lead to a bigger panic. If the bubble pops, it’s gonna get ugly. In a matter of few hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:40:12
First question that comes to my mind when i hear about this pizza guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:28:35
17,358 over here. Forgot to put a sell order over the night.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:29:34
Same thing happened at cex yesterday. Pumped up the price of xrp all the way to 1.80. I was one of the morons who bought at 1.50 and didn’t cash out in time, thinking it would go up more. The dump took 30 seconds. Lost around 1.5k ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:03
Same here
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:40:59
Send them to me. I’ll sell them and wire you the money ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:00:06
You’re not alone, bro. I’ve wanted to smash my head soo many times for not buying or selling on time. Only way to avoid stress in crypto world is to hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:17:29
Thank you. I’ll ask the exchange to self exclude me. You mean bastard. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:13:02
You could use shapeshift to convert to btc or any other coin and sell it
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:47:15
cex.io. Very convenient. Fast deposits and withdrawals 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:04:42
I am the other man
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:48:26
Tried to make money on arbitrage. Practically not possible due to fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:53:07
Same here
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:40:09
US east coast waking up? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:56:04
What if he’s dead already and the bitcoins are gone forever? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:46:02
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:14:58
cex.io. Never had an issue
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:58:53
Thanks m8. I calculated this morning, that if i’d have hodled since October, would have made much more. Lesson learned. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:53:44
I’m using cex.io, where the prices are also a bit more expensive than US and Europe. Did research on asian markets and all of them have high fees. Still anxious to go for it. Only thing is, we don’t know each other. How are we going to collaborate? ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:16:25
Seriously. Got a long position open. Up around $300-400 already. Don’t know if i should close it or not. Hoping for a rocket. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:37:51
Fuck yeah, m8
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:41:55
cex.io. Very convenient
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:52:23
cex.io. Pretty convenient 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:00:25
You funny bastard
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:00:08
Been through that 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:59:37
I lost my sleep for last several days now. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:24:44
Yes. CC withdrawals were almost instant for me
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:57:46
Hope rise keeps going after US wakes up. East coast and a little more when west coast.
I live myself at gmt +4
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:03:24
Yep. That’s what i keep telling myself. Pretty sure it’s going back up. Hopefully ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:02:20
Have you tried it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:55:44
Lost a bunch on margin trading. Only chance to recover is to go long again, which i already did. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:16:46
Stop loss is around 14k and the rollover fees are not that high. So i guess i’ll just wait. All or nothing. Fucking trader my ass. Fml����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:23:53
Been using cex.io for a while. Happy so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:41:34
I got my account verified in an hour or so. Never had a problem since then. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:34:26
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:35:05
cex.io works good for me
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:39:19
Suprisingly fast. My CC was credited in less than a minute. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:21:26
You mean fuck
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:47:57
Yeah. FML. Made pretty good profit a few times. The worst part is, i was up $400 so i decided to close the position to secure the profit and open a new one. So this is the new fucking one that won’t let me relax now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:31:05
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:46:34
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:12:32
Yeah. Wanted to make some money on arbitrage. No luck. Fees are too high. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:42:33
Like me. Fees and shit won’t let you make any profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:18:32
Thanks. I’ll check it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:56:50
Hell yeah it was. Made a lot of people nervous. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:59:11
Never had a problem with cex. Been doing some day trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:13:38
What pisses me off is - lost an opportunity to meanwhile make profit on altcoins. All my funds are locked with the fucking long. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:26:20
Dipshit 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:23:50
The ones i was able to get verified, taking into account that i’m in Azerbaijan. iqoption, lakebtc, exmo and another shitty exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:17:16
Попробуйте cex.io. Пользуюсь. Вроде неплохо. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:54:10
17,358 here ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:56:12
Don’t know man. I’m becoming a king of missing dips already. Too hard to predict
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:12:14
Holidays could as well be a reason for people to cash out for gifts and stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:28:30
I think Lakebtc sells with paypal
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:30:30
Cex.io and iqoption.com
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:44:56
I’ve listened to advices here on Reddit yesterday and lost $600 yesterday. At the end of the day, 95% of people giving advices don’t know shit!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:15:20
You’re not alone
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:26:52
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:21:11
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:08:41
Margin trading. Had a short open
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:21:35
You sure you’re gonna make it on time? Cashing out
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:23:20
Multiply your btc amount to 500,000?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:55:55
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:45:57
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:12:55
It better not fucking be. Or i’ll dig it out and kill myself. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:24:34
Are you stoned?
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:53:04
Never mind. Didn’t get your question right ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:45:35
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:46:33
What now, should i buy in to cover the loss? ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:19:46
Yep. Screw that. Starting to recover since bought in. Should have done that long time ago. Fucking noobie   Fml ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:56:33
I have a short @ 10,100. FML. Already down around $600. Broke the “don’t short btc’ rule ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:30:58
Yeah. Gotta watch what’s going on around btc all the time. Well, good luck m8
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:12:54
Yeah. I did. Bought little more than 0.2 btc. Gonna hodl. Fuck short term shit
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:44:35
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:46:33
cex.io. Takes several seconds to withdraw the cash to your credit/debit card
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:45:27
Closed with -$620 ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:30:01
Less than 10 seconds to be credited to my debit card. That’s fiat. 
Eth and btc take around 15-20 minutes. Took around 15 minutes this morning. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:20:24
Except my dumbass did not fucking get it on time. Pissed since yesterday ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:01:26
It did fucking dip! You fucking experts! Could have easily breakeven and buy in the dip! God damn it!!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:41:12
My guess is, it’s easier to buy with btc, rather than going through process of cashing out.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:37:16
Was hoping for at least a little drop so that i could minimize the loss at least.
Fucking lesson learned. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:00:35
Got a short ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:11:39
Reason - fast deposit and withdraw (both fiat and crypto)
Fast verification approval
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:03:14
Me at $10,700. Fml
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:32:57
Yeah. I was surprised as well. Suits me pretty good. Sticking to cex
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:13:49
You guys think it will fall even more? Like to 7-8k?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:10:08
Same here����‍♂️ 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:50:03
Strange. Haven’t had a problem with cex. Deposited and withdrawn both cash and crypto. 
What exactly happened?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:46:26
Wow, that was my birthday ��
