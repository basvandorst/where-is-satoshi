hello?  have you been holding this whole time?
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:52:36
Sort of a false premise.
Yes, if this is truly gambling, just like in Vegas, if stay at the table long enough and the house will take all of your money.  Those are just the odds.  By contrast, in stocks, the majority of the time you actually can wait out a price drop - if you otherwise have enough liquidity to get along.  Here in crypto-world we are really somewhere in between.  Sort of gambling, sort of investing.
But if you really think BTC will go to zero, it is odd that you spend time here.  Its a bit too hopeful for that schadenfreud moment - with total strangers no less.
Your comment also presupposes a "one and done" philosophy.  Someone takes the pains to buy in the first place... just to lock-in a loss with a stop... and then walks away never to return.
Nobody on this sub is a one-and-done.  Once folks know themselves - or at least what their own behavior will be - it becomes really, really silly to panic and sell.
What, sell so you only lose part of your money?  But then buy again tomorrow?  Stop losses really only work for folks that are sophisticated enough to catch falling knifes... which most folks here are not (I'm sure not).
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:29:16
It really seems like a steady climb out of the doldrums.  I think we can all breath a collective sigh that winter is ending and spring has arrived. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:19:38
Can someone explain what I was just watching a minute or two ago?  (Where BTC is at roughly 10750 and has these fractional seconds of dropping to 10500?  and then back, and so on and so forth?)  It reminds me of unexpected turbulents on approach for landing where the plane drops a thousand feet out of nowhere.
Is this all because of bots?  Or is this somebody making a buy/sell order mistake?  Are these whale attempts to break sell or buy walls and trigger auto trading algorithms?
They just look really out of place, so I was wondering.
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:36:57
I love these pumps and dumps!  Literally happening every hour or two!  And every single time, enough people are falling for it!  Do folks just not look at the 1m and 5m charts?   Is everyone's screen stuck on a 1w chart?
The rank manipulation is stealing from all of you!  You have two options.  Hold or stay on the sideline.  Until enough folks do either (or both) this stairway to hell continues.
I mean really, doesn't everyone want to get the bottom over with so we can start over and get on with life? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:15:48
an attractive price compared to what?  the last time it dipped all the way to 6K?  the way I see it, 90% of the market already anticipates a double bottom... meaning anyone with a functioning brain is sitting in USD and USDT waiting for the market to reset so we can begin a traditional bull run.  The only thing up in the air is whether we truly go to 6K, or whether we reach ignition around 6.5K... or suffer the dooms day scenario... and plummet even further...
So folks are not yet "fearful."  We all expect this drop.  We are all on the sidelines.  The Buffet "fear/greed" axiom only works if people are actually in the market.
For the time being, whales, bots, and fools are trying to figure out how to get all of us back from the sidelines...

If you are doing a science project on Market Psychology or a math project on market economics, then you are in exactly the right place.
If you are bringing your allowance or $$ from a part time job, now is a good time to learn all of your hard lessons.
I did the equivalent with pink sheet stocks in high school (through a custodial account).  I learned a lot about probabilities, fees, taxes, etc.  valuable life lessons most adults are clueless about.
But if you are here for other reasons, do yourself a huge favor and discuss with a parent, uncle, teacher - someone with a little experience who can help.  Before you realize it, tax documents will get issued on your account - because we are headed this direction...

Oh crap!!!  Every time I make $$$ at the track, I just lose it here!  What’s the difference?  There aren’t any bots, and there isn’t any corruption or inside trading at the track!
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:10:37
Do you ladder your buys?  Depends on the $$ involved whether it is worth it.  But if you have a decent amount at play..?  What I've seen people do is something like this: 25% at 9800, maybe another 25% at 9600, another 25% at 9400, and the last bit at 9k even....  you might average yourself out at 9500... but it requires less timing that a single purchase... and that bots hate it... they really REALLY hate it... because they want to wipe you out all at once...
The trick is figuring out when to start and when to end your laddered purchases....
don't let yourself run out of $$$ if it crashes all over again...
ALSO: "Stop Buy Orders" should really be called FOMO orders... because you are saying, if the price gets to a certain level, you are afraid that means the train is leaving the station... and you don't want to miss out... (I think that is a good way to get burned on fake bull pumps). 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:45:44
try this - make fractional buys next time.  For example.  BTC drops $200, so buy 0.05 BTC.  It drops again, buy another 0.05 BTC.  You wake up in the morning and it is down another $1000... buy 0.1 BTC.
Dollar-cost-average your buys (and sells if you want) and it will take a lot of the "bad timing" risk out....
Or so it seems.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:33:05
Exactly.  This needs to stop.  Effective IMMEDIATELY, no posts of anguish.  No shadenfeud (sp sorry.  F’ing auto correct.  Worst creation ever.). No negative posts.  No “watch out, I think it is correcting even more.”)
There is only up.  As the Jedi would say (if you read all the books) “ there is only peace.”
Now to get back to the laundry list of approved topics, and as an effort to retake a thread hijacked by day traders, I would like to first celebrate BTC (ok, now we got that out of the way... central bank laughing) and then discuss the best pizza in the world, Zachary’s stuffed pizza (in Berkeley, CA).  Look it up.  It is amazing.  Amazing, amazing, amazing.  I’ve been going there before most of you were even floating around in the nut sack.  But since you are here, and it’s still there, go an try it.

Because of the short duration and sky-rocketing intensity of the recent buy (an hour and a half ago) that these are programed institutional buys?  Basically an institutional pump and dump?  Or is there not enough volume to reach that conclusion?
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:05:46
ok.  i think I understand.  so you are all just saying the trading range is shrinking.. and this means the pressure grows hour by hour for one side or the other to yell "uncle" (at which point it goes one way or the other).  Who will cry "uncle" first....  a financial game of chicken as it were...
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:33:51
I am so excited that I finally (mis) placed a buy order last night (mis-guessing the approximate drop).  If I could kick myself in the ass I would.  Moments like now have me convinced this is only an elaborate game to mess with my mind.  (e.g. if I had not placed the order, it would not have gone anywhere, or if I had placed the order lower, it would have fell one-penny shy of execution).  But now all of my apples are baking in the pie... so my only option is to celebrate BTC, join the HODL (or buy) team... and dance in celebration of BTC until the floor wears out.
I need a Clock Work Orange quality eye-lid "keep-er opener" to just plant myself in front of the screen 24/7 so I can just live trade without need for sleep.

So if it makes sense to you, please elaborate.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:07:58
Could you elaborate a little on “use as a currency?”  Because, depending on what you mean, your statement could be interpreted as  assuming a certain level of purchasing power that outstrips alternative mechanisms.... 
My long term goal is always maximization if purchasing power.  Whether BTC, fiat, a bushel of wheat, or an hour of labor, I didn’t not want to “over pay.”

@_date: 2018-03-18 00:02:58
Depends.  If you see BTC as a universally accepted digit bearer bond, then 20k, 50K, etc., are not crazy valuations.  If you see BTC as a point of service payment mechanism, than yes, it is totally crazy to be over $500.
Consumer adoption of BTC is NOT what is needed.  CORPORATE adoption of BTC is what is needed.  Other alt coins make infinitely more sense for consumer adoption (e.g. walking into a coffee shop to buy some coffee, paying for jeans at a department store, buying football tickets on line, etc...).
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:19:47
How do you reach this conclusion?  On March 3, 10, and 11 we learned that nobody wanted to sell below 8.5k.  But we also learned on March 10, 11, and 12 that nobody wants to buy above 9.8k.  So here we go.  Half the active trading crowd is convinced it will not rise above 10k.  Half the trading crowd is convinced it will not fall below 8.5k.
To me, it means groundhog day, every day, until an external mover acts on the market.  Government crack down.  Exchange hack.  Trustee bankruptcy sale.  All the external possibilities are FUD related.  I struggle to think of a single external mover that is FOMO based.  And I struggle to see any internal mechanism (other than rank price manipulation) that will propel us out of this relative equilibrium.
One good thing it seems, is that this "is" the new equilibrium - which in and of itself could be good long term news.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:50:38
Can you please explain where to subscribe to receive these "buy signals?"  Are you looking at the moving averages, volume, past low points?  While I tend to agree with you, my signal is basically a "gut feeling."  (Which of course, probably means I am wrong - because if it is obvious to me, it will be obvious to everyone else, and under the Dis-transitive Property of Market Dynamic In-Equality, it will not happen).  Only that which few anticipate will actually happen.

??  It isn't a loss until you sell.... (well, maybe a loss in time or utility, but not financial until you sell).  Unless you are great at catching falling knifes I would not kick yourself too much.  I fell asleep at the wheel a while back and got so pissed (after I woke up to see the drop) I just unplugged the computer for a week.  When I finally came back, i was right back where I started - except I wasn't feeling bad about the drop!  Sure I missed out on what could have been some nice gains... but I also missed out on the equivalent of a FUD induced stop-loss... and I got a week of my life back while I wasn't at the keyboard.

Ordinarily, in a universe governed by physics and math, I would totally agree.  But this place is somewhere between the advent horizon and the singularity itself.  It is all warped.  Literally day, after day, it is up $500-800, climbing stairs with no end in sight.
Anyone willing (or with enough self-discipline to hold for more than a week is truly rewarded).  Folks that keep jumping out of the way (anticipating this is really a game of chicken) get to keep a modest return and a huge helping of FOMO (except for it isn't fear of the future) it's YRDMO (you really did miss out... phonetically, and conveniently, sounds like "your a dumb-o.")
I'd love to say it will dip, so I could buy more - because conventional investing discipline prohibits me from doing so now - but there is nothing conventional about it.
As I mentioned, but was a little off, this hit CNBC once it broke 11K... and I really think we are off to the races.  I don't think this isn't going to meaningfully correct until we are at a new ATH.
Literally, as I was writing this, it is up another $60 - just breaking 11.5K.  Barring some breaking news (like BTC is nothing but monkeys hammering away on a key-board) this shit is going to bring out more Lambo mentions than any of us can take.
I for one want an M5.  Midnight Blue.  Saddle Leather interior.  And an extra set of tires for when I burn through the first set doing donuts in the cul-de-sac.  That is good enough for me.

I hear you.  For me, Cryptocurrencies were basically a fun way to treat a small percentage of my over all investment/retirement portfolio.  What has been difficult to learn, is that traditional methods for evaluating an investment do not really apply to cryptocurrency.  Gold, real estate, stocks, bonds, all have pretty easily understandable rules.  So my investment/gamble was just that.  My buying or selling or holding will have zero to do with the adoption of ledger technology or the adoption of non-sovereign or corporate based stores of wealth.  So my original reason WAS a speculative play.  And today, it remains a speculative play.  But it is your thought about bubbles which also has my attention.  Bubbles ordinarily don't re-inflate once they burst... at least not for a very long time.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:30:39
My favorite part has been the community on this sub who have urged fellow members to HOLD (this misspelling is too dumb to repeat on purpose).  HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.  Please HOLD.  You will lose your money if you sell.  It will go back up (someday).
Ordinarily, I would sell when I saw the inevitable down trend.  I would take a 5-10% hit in the estimation I would save purchasing power for still lower prices.
This last time around I made a cardinal error.  And now, I am paying dearly with massive losses in opportunity and time.
I am down almost 30% on one major crypto-currency.  Now my inaction leaves me with a much more difficult decision.  Cut losses now - at prices not seen since last November and eat a couple grand in losses - or risk seeing even lower prices, prices not seen since last August.
Please learn from my errors.  If you are going to do this game of rampant speculation and insider information - you have to follow your gut, you have to ignore most of reddit, and you have act decisively.  Fail to do any of these three, and you really risk being in my position.
So.  Do I "lock in" my losses?  Do I wait out the next drop?  Do I hope for a really substantial market drop and then double down to dollar cost average my way out of this?  Honestly, I am really thinking of doing the latter... assuming this place really plummets.
In any event, I do appreciate those of you who post... and even though I have not posted for a while... I am heartened to see many of the same familiar faces...

Hopefully you have made a lot... Frankly, I don't see it being a particularly good value to buy a depreciating asset with something like BTC.  You pay 1K USD for a laptop on NewEgg Today.  You pay with 1K of BTC.  The laptop arrives in 5 days.  But when you finally get your hands on the laptop 5 days later, BTC has gone up 40%.  (Which is basically the last 5 days in real life).
Would you over pay 40% for a laptop?  (purchase with the asset class that most closely matches the depreciation of the consumer good.  Cash right out of your pay check.)
Unless, philosophically, you are short BTC... in which case - good job thinking about the purchase!

I just don't get the "trending towards 8k" bit.  Is this because you think any near term double bottom is still subject to a longer-term double (which has not happened?)

Many expected a double bottom taking us sub-7K.
Over the last week there have been many, many $200-500 pumps, followed by larger dumps.  But most starting and finishing in hours, or at least by day's end.
The last drop has a pretty standard V-bottom, followed by a good volume rise, followed by another rise.
Is it a pump?  With each passing hour/day, it looks more and more convincing it is not.  Could it be a short (2-4 day) rally, which will be followed by a continuation down?  Probably, but who really knows.
I am torn.  I both want it to drop a little more, in hopes of buying more.  I also want it to rise (so I don't regret purchases I have already made).  My buys have placed me right in the middle of this uncertainty.

Question:  Why is there pretty consistently a $30 to $40 dollar spread in the spot price between GDAX and other exchanges (e.g. Bittrex, Binance, etc.)
Is this reflecting the difference between a USD market and a USDT market?

Well, it sure ain't a "techy" forum.  People are not here out of love for the technology.  Everyone here either wants/hopes/needs to make some $$$.  That means everyone either (a) regrets selling too soon on a rally, (b) buying right before a dip or correction, (c) wishes they had more money to gamble, or (d) has developed an unhealthy obsession for shinny objects - which this sub provides hourly.
Once in again there are some great comments about TA (which in crypto is really like palm reading).  Other times there some classically comical stories, etc.  A handful of over used inside jokes (e.g. "Hey guys, I am selling... prepare for the rally").
Truth be told, being here posting away probably keeps most of these folks well on the road to recovery - and away from their past of internet porn addictions.  (think methadone for heroin)  Why else all the green dildo references?
But asking a sub full of "shills" or "bots" for a recommendation for a quality sub elsewhere may be a little like asking where to get directions to the hidden city in Atlas Shrugged.  (meaning, you have to know how to get there on your own).
As for me, I am with the bots.  Boop, beep, boop.  See everyone in the AM when this has taken a dump to 10k even.

I got off the pot just in time to cancel my buy order... Whew.  Bots almost got me.  I'm long term bullish on BTC, but I think it is due for a little step down.  (Sort of a 2-3 steps forward, 1-2 steps back).  This has been feeling like 5 steps forward, 1 step back.

Question about buying back in.  So I have long since learned to tier my buys and sells (to balance out my inability to time the swings).  But one thing I am working out is how far apart to gauge buys.
E.g. 10% of available $$ at $100 increments (the increment being the price drop)?  15% of available reserves invested in $300 increments?
I am probably much more conservative on buys than sells - I might buy back in with 8-10 steps... but sell out in 2-3 steps.
Opinions?  Thoughts?  Given the current dip?
Oh, and when Moon?

@_date: 2018-03-09 02:21:00
well, here is the thing.  Lets say I figured this would be a 20% dip.  So I start buying as the dip commences.  First purchase around 11k.  and every few hundred south, I pick up some more.  Disciplined gambling, right?  Low and behold, I run out of $$$ on my last buy - at about 9.2k.  So I've given myself an average of 9.8k on my laddered buys.  But now, I am ALL IN.
As I continue to stare at the screen, it starts sinking in.  And I think, I can take a loss of 10% here and now - and see if my gut proves correct that I can buy back in next week at a substantial discount which makes my current 10% loss irrelevant in the scheme of things.
Eg.  I put $10 in and it is worth $9.  I sell and run with my $9, but buy back in at $6.  Instead of (1) unit at 10, I could have (1.5) units at 6.  And when 6 goes back to 12, I have 18, not the 12 I would earn if I HODL.

You don't type in round numbers when making a buy or sell?  You really have some odd ended integer?  People like rounded off numbers because it makes them easier to keep straight in their mind.  How much did you pay for that?  (do you say "$5.13" or "5-bucks.")  Look at product advertising - Taco Bells "5 dollar meal"  (They didn't call it the $5.21 meal)  Humans are weird this way.

Yup.  Keep banning speech.  That is a good answer.  People that advocate banning speech need to take a step back and think about their perspective.  I wonder if there are lots of other areas in life where you want to ban speech?
Frankly, I find the FUD serves several purposes to anyone with a working brain.  (1) it is funny.  (2) occasionally it makes a great point that deserves consideration.  (3) for "new comers" to BTC in general, maybe, just maybe it keep them from investing (or gambling) for a few days - and gives them a chance to get educated before succumbing to exaggerations of getting rich quick. 
You don't like the FUD?  You don't like the comments about the market tumbling?  Maybe you can use your insights to post counter arguments.  Maybe the most compelling argument can just compete to see if it wins out?  (reminiscent of Capitalism anyone?)
BTC and ledger tech in general is terrific.  Is it AI?  No.  It ain't.  Not even close.  But does it carry transformative economic possibility?  Sure.  Will it harken an age of free love and universal wealth?  No.
A "daily" on BTC is all about day trading.  It is all about FOMO vs FUD.  If it was a "celebration" forum, (a) it would not be daily and (b) nobody would visit.  We are all here, at all hours, seeing which horse is going to get around the track the fastest.  (After which you will still receive your 1099, still pay taxes, and still bear your anti-establishment bent).
So dear moderators, please ignore bots who propose banning speech.    Because no free thinking human being would propose such a thing.

What you will find, in time, is that there is evidence to support literally any outcome.  Look at the 5 min chart - bull run on!  Look at the 6 hour chart - Bears control.  Look to the stars, Uranus is in Virgo.  Feel the bumps on your head - a good thought is coming.  Look at the lines on the palm of your hands - oh my, you'll be wealthy and then lose it all.
You have better odds predicting the outcome of professional sports.  TA sort of works in traditional investing.  This is not investing.  We are all day trading based upon the prevailing winds.  Some claim to be holding until the sun engulf the earth - but they are all really day trading (er, gambling).
Just jump in.  I promise that the second you do, it will dip $100-200 and you'll be kicking yourself.  Then you'll jump in even more to feel better about the price - and it will dip again.  Then you will sell out of fear you cannot pay your mortgage - and it will rise $400... and you will scream at your computer and pound on the desk.
Then you will repeat this all over again.

I agree using credit to "gamble" is really bad (this is not investing).  But it is a curious value judgment on the part of credit card companies to restrict what sorts of lawful purchases you can make.  I tend to believe they are upset about the inevitable outflows of capital that, long term, will have nothing to do with them.  Crypto currency shrinks the pie of the world in which they operate.  Prove me wrong - is there any credit institution that would accept crypto currency to payoff your credit card?  This is, to me, like old cell phone providers that wanted to lock you into 2 year contracts (whoops, that sales model is gone) or cable companies that made you buy 200 channels to get the 5 you actually watch (whoops, internet TV is in the process of destroying that business model).  Crypto is a competing business model for which they are unprepared.  And they are pissing their pants over it.  (But yes, for the time being, the crypto world is really way too volatile).

Absolutely, if you have liquidity to increase your position and reduce your average buy-in cost, in addition to a long time horizon... you are in a good position.  But that "steeled" feeling is not as easy to maintain when you finally run out of liquidity... or if you were hoping to make a buck by next week.

I just wish someone would get in there and say enough already.  We are going to dip to 6K.  We will hold there for about 2 days.  Then we will rocket off to 10K, then after a little bit of a rest, we'll keep climbing to 15K.  After 15K, all bets are off.
This market makes it nearly impossible to gamble.  Even a basketball game has a shot clock.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:26:23
yes and no.  If you see the knife falling and you deploy your batman grappling hook to avoid the drop.... you can swing in at a lower level and buy more... I took (2) different 5-10% losses.... but it saved me from a 35-40% fall... so while my USD was smaller, my buy back in was for a larger portion of BTC... meaning my upside was greater than simply holding.
I get the part about locking in losses.  nobody wants to do that.  but the other part is locking in your time (as you wait to crawl out of the grave).  and another part is locking in your lack of liquidity, which in turn, locks you out of future opportunity... again, all as you wait to simply crawl out of the grave.
The only good thing about this casino is that the tide goes in and out every week... so the time cost (in many cases) is just a week... but it can be horrendous... think folks who bought AND held after buying BTC at the ATH.  They are going to be waiting a long time.  And feeling like shit each day of that wait.  I strongly suspect nobody who bought AND held at the ATH would do so again.

Or do we hate government and regulation more than we hate being manipulated and losing all our money?
Right now we have the worst of both worlds.  We get taxed on the cash out (1099 is in the mail!

Several banks are essentially prohibiting such transactions.  Many credit and debit cards as well.  Possibly, your only option would be to do an ACH transfer (not immediate purchase) and see if it really goes through to Coinbase... which will take 8-9 days to confirm.

Do not confuse intelligence for emotion.  Being intelligent has very little to do with guarding against emotional decisions.  Often there is an inverse relationship because most intelligent people "control" the things in their lives... giving them less practice with being out of control....whereas less intelligent people are often at the whim of the world... and are more emotionally resilient as a result.

Maybe it is me... but from what I have read on these forums, the fees are extraordinary.  Would you feel ok paying a 15-20% premium when it is all said and done?  (Fees from you card, the network (the bid/ask price - which may not be as competitive as you might find on the exchanges), the machine, whatever else).
Believe me, the 8-9 day delay you are experiencing with an ACH will do two things: (1) it will give you 8-9 days to read around on various forums and learn how things work and (2) it will force you to learn self-restraint by becoming familiar with helplessness.  This will result in your making better decisions in the long run.
Otherwise, you really increase your likelihood of really being agent FUBAR.

But my weakness brings me back... at all hours... but I am still not ready to admit I have a problem... and I will still maintain each pump is the beginning of a new enduring rally to the moon... and I'll still deny that I shit my pants with each dump... the market has become that illusive girl that I fawned over but who never gave me the time of day.
I appreciate your effort at some tough love.  I am just not ready to hear it yet.

This is true... but it is really odd to me that almost nobody thinks we are near the bottom... which means we should be clearing out weak hands much more decisively (albiet with a steeper drop, but with a quicker resolution to get the market back on track).  However, people seem to keep buying... and then selling... resulting in this slow downward trend, step by step...
Rip the bandaid off already!  Look at the post above you - "Thanks weak hands... bought at $7900..." says the guy who is now looking at a price about to descend below $7700...less than an hour later...
Pump and dump folks and inside trading folks are dragging this pain out... I for one will not jump back in until the WTF price appears... and it isn't there yet.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:38:02
Ir really keeps knocking.  Close to 8K... then a pump... then dump... rinse, repeat... then someone says "battle stations," then we all grab our ankles... what a sick, cosmic joke.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:11:46
Hang in there everyone.  I am buying in right now... so if past experience is any lesson, the market will head south shortly.  Sorry, but happens every single time.
I'll post again when I am about to sell.  Sure fire impetus for market to surge.
This way at least all of you can get your timing right.  No helping me.
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:48:26
so basically (on the 2h) you are saying you see what could be the near term double bottom... and from here usually markets would climb.  (Am I interpreting you correctly?)
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:48:49
(Now look what you did.  All that coordinated effort).  You were suppose to say "the".
Looks like they will have to start all over again.

What percentage of your entire asset capacity are you planning to "invest" in bitcoin?  (Taking into account all retirement, all savings, all investments, all real estate holdings, etc.).  25%?  50%?
You say "serious money."  Are these inherited assets?  Earned assets?  Imaginary assets?  I only ask, because in most situations, people with serious money are ordinarily "sophisticated investors" (term of art) to begin with.
Asking for professional advice (whether here, or there) is a lot like asking for professional advice right before you pull the arm on slot machine.  Now if you are simply sitting on a pile of cash, have no idea what the word "debt" or "mortgage" means, and suffer from a complete lack of self control or a compulsive disorder, I suppose I can see why you would want someone else to be the adult in the room.
You may be better off asking "when moon?"

Oh my goodness, I’m currently all out, but I woke this morning with a severe case of FOMO.
I get the buy and HODL mantra, but I keep thinking I should wait for a little more retreat - eg, like sever hours ago when it touched 7800-7900.
And with Chinese New Year quickly approaching, any thoughts if this might impact the markets?  Up or down?
Personally I think TA is really a lot like astrology or phrenology, but I do think systemic sentiment is a real thing... (rising tide lifts all boats)...
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:10:36
at this rate, you might be right.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:15:38
I sold earlier today.  Happens every time.  I now post my buys and sells so you guys can benefit from my loss.  My last 4 buys/sells were inversely situated to what happened immediately after.  The bots are watching me...

Probably when they stop printing Tether.... which will be never....
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:25:20
I'm not sure.  Look at the 12-hour chart and see a 10-15% dip/correction/fud on Feb 9-12... possibly, right now, we are just doing it all over again on our way higher... but yeah, if we shit below 10K there is a good chance it is groundhogs day all over again.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:52:55

This.  I find it curious beyond belief that creditors will allow me to max out my card on flowers, pizza, beer, psychic-hotlines, and all sorts of perishable consumables... but they are barring the purchase of competing currency which - when full implemented - has no use/need for them.  Jealous, scared, I'm not sure.  But banks are the cable companies of yesterday.  And I think they know it.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:54:14
you never got out?  not at all?
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:13:00
This.  10k is a mental barrier.  But in my opinion, not a mental "sell" barrier.  People hoping for a double bottom are sitting on the sides FOMOing like crazy.  At 10K you will hear "oh, F- I'm late!" bouncing off the ionosphere like an ad-hoc ham radio.  People will start jumping in (forgetting they missed out on buying at 6,7,8,9k) and finally, finally more worried that they are about to miss the Good Ship Lollipop to 20K.  The really worrisome musical chairs game will take place in the 17-20K range as the music slows and people slowly start positioning themselves near the exits like those two guys in Dunkirk.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:23:27
If they will need cash for al those cats and dogs - doesn't that mean (a) they will sell BTC for fiat or at least (b) not buy BTC?  No purchase volume?  Meaning down she comes?
Confused by UP we'll go.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:37:50
No.  You just need those "keep your eye-lids open" things from, A Clock Work Orange.  While they look painful, I suspect they are less addictive.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:21:23
What you do with it?  Not sure.  Up to you.  Some people buy other parts (sometimes you can find them on the ground just like old pennies, sometimes you can find the parts you don't have at rummage sales).  When you have all the component parts of the whole, you can usually glue them together and trade them in for a shiny new one.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:18:52
Because every time I sell, bots drive the price up another $300.... its Dante's Comedy all over again....
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:38:21
Ask yourself - How will you feel when you wake up tomorrow and it is at 10,200.  How would you feel tomorrow at lunch as you watch it trend over 10.5?  Would you feel like an idiot for doubting what you saw was inevitably coming?
Now ask the same if you woke up tomorrow and it was at 9.5... and as you watched it trend to 9.2 during lunch.  Would you feel  sense of relief knowing you had not gambled right now?
Now consider, which of those two (up or down) feels more intense?  Then, go with the other one - because you don't know yourself well enough to make these decisions.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:53:57
Nice try bot.  We can still tell you are a bot.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:01:02
Whelp!  Looks like it decided to drop again - stairway to hell.  Sigh.  Hopefully the thought police will come back and order a BTC celebration.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:44:43
I for one always saw your potential.  Its not being lazy.  It's called being efficient.  
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:04:58
This will be north of 10K before my bubble bath is over.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:41:39
I was selling.  Usually I give everyone advanced notice, but last time the "no sense of humor" crowd gave me like 20 down votes.  Serious folks around here.  On Reddit.

You and me both, brother, you and me both.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:08:46
That is if phrenology has any application here.  Re-check your FOMO chart.  It literally has this thing lighting off like a Roman Candle if we break 10k (in part because it will show up on CNBC as breaking news story... where they will highlight the 19K peak, the precipitous drop, and the fact we are climbing on our way back up... folks will be (a) "piss, I missed 6K, but (b) "10K is still a long way from 19K, so there is still lots of easy money to make...").  People waiting for a double bottom need to look elsewhere on the web.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:08:03
It depends on what your goals are - just like all investing.  Is this a retirement gamble?  Then buy and come back once a year to see what is going on.  HOLDing May be perfectly appropriate.  
Maybe a financial goal with a 2 year time line?  Then perhaps focus on the market sentiment.  Is the tide going in or out?  Bull market or bear over the next several weeks?  HOLDing May make less sense.  Strategic switching may make more sense.
Day trading?  See that knife?!  Drop it like it’s hot!  Green dildo forming?  Better buy so you can ride the second and third soldier and then quickly sell to he FOMO crowd.  Rinse and repeat.
We are all here with slightly different goals.  There is not a one size fits all.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:55:17
Wasn't all day yesterday an uptrend?  If it kept going up, are you saying it is a new uptrend (off a bounce)?
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:58:40
Perhaps you meant stop loss at 10.8K?  Usually a stop loss is a set amount below the purchase price.
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:08:19
Yes.  Grabbing ankles now.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:12:13
Very disappointed.  This was supposed to have been north of 10k by the time my bubble bath was done.  And I was in there nearly 45 minutes.  Maybe I needed more bubbles.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:59:08
Please post when you buy next... so I can anticipate the dip.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:05:57
that sounds pretty ominous given the prices we saw in Feb.
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:53:45
Ok, against my better judgment - I am locking in losses now - with the expectation that this market is about to fill up the out-house with shit (so why get covered in it OR get locked up in days of illiquidity).
Stand by, massive rally on its way.  I really hate this.  Trading BTC = window into the soul.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:56:05
Exactly.  Erik Finman made this exact point on CNBC weeks back (sometime in December).  When ever he makes a transaction (paying with BTC) he considers his lost opportunity cost by asking whether he would be willing to pay 5-times the price for the product.  Google the video.  He may have been lucky making money on BTC, but there is some disciplined wisdom in what he says (as a 17 year old no less).
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:15:00
I hear you.  Most folks aren't cut out for this sort of volatility.  When people ask, I explain it took me years of experience to acquire my steady nerves.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:32:58

Thanks in part to my selling, we've another $1k swing (up) in less than 24 hours... 9.6K to 10.6k...wow... and up approx. 4K in 10 days....with no end in sight?  Unreal.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:55:06
Does this feel like last time to you too?
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:53:30
It depends, in my estimation, on what you are doing here.  If you are a "buy today" and check back in a year or two.... then definitely get off the exchange and put in a secure wallet.  But in all reality, most everyone here is trading.  Maybe not every hour, or even every day, but probably at least once a week or so.  If you keep taking money off exchanges and putting it back, you will pay a decent amount in fees (since most exchanges charge you to take $$$ off the exchange).  A percent here and a percent there starts adding up if you really are trading.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:34:51
This is exactly how I felt.  Plummeting to earth and finally pulling the parachute before I go splat... but not quick enough to avoid some pain.
Every time I’ve been careful to stagger my buys, the market never ceased to put do me, going far below the money I had available to buy dips.
Now I just flip a quarter, make a trade, and check back the next day...
