Literally gave no useful information.  Way to phone it in anusface.

My apologies.  He does seem to exhibit some signs.  It was more of an observation than a put down of those afflicted.  
He's just so rabid in his evangelism of BCH that he reminds me of a spoiled little rich kid not getting his way.  My ultimate pet peeve. 
I really feel for all those poor folks that got left with their dicks in their hand, while all of the insider traders took their money yesterday.

Quit reading the cards you pile of shit garbage human.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:50:37
Hah, yeah.  Well, we had the Unabomber, and Timothy McVey here.  Both domestic terrorists.  I know at least McVey (if not both) used agricultural products to bomb the Federal Building in Oklahoma City here in the 90's.  So we are a bit regulated on AG products because of their ability to be mishandled, or weaponized.

Good point.  They don't deserve to be compared to that goofy fuck.

What's bitcoin's price right now?  .....Pull that up Young Jaime.

Good eye!  I almost missed that. ;-)

Quit crying boy.  Pull yourself together and buy the dips!

He should have been jailed for his childish, bratty, bitchy attitude.

Pretty next-level comment here for only being a redditor for 2 weeks.  Impressive.
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:43:48
Because people believe in it.

I got a nasty leg kick.  Let me know if you want to taste these shins.

Jesus, did he get this from the Alt Right starter kit?
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:00:38
I've had a ticket in for over a month and I can't pull anything out.  I was verified before, and now they are requiring I get enhanced out of the blue.  Upgrading to enhanced failed for because I forgot that I used my middle name(the one I go by day to day) even though it's on my ID.  I've had no response from them.  Eagerly waiting to use the exchange again with confidence.

I really like this post.  Kudos to you my friend.  Also, feel free to guild me on the way out ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:43:56
Ahhhh, good point.  Must have been Halloween.  No other reason to ever wear any of what's happening in that picture.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:25:09
Yeah dude.  Which one of your mom's can I pay to get a handjob now?
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:57:59
What a waste of time.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:02:38
I like your style, bro.

I posted the video to start at the time they started talking about it (I can't help it your computer is stupid.  Content was stated and you decided to watch (So, go fuck yourself).  The point of the video is that crypto is reaching not only the underground, but also the mainstream.  Not only that, it's been to the mainstream and trickling back down back underground to the alt / niche world.  Which does us all a world of good in terms of pricing and adoption.  So again, you may be more stupid than you already were (IQ &lt; 90 or so) but also my friend.  ....go fuck yourself.   Again.  Next time learn how to take a joke, and enjoy life, you might learn something.  Thank you and have a good day.

Welcome to 2012 homie.

Came here to say "oh yeah, this guy's getting no pussy."  You beat me to it.  Kudos.
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:39:05
[Calmer than you are.](  Don't worry nobody is watching this intentionally goofy video anyway.  It was meant to bring a little light hearted fun around here where it tends to be a little stuffy.  But, it's fun to know that I've wasted a good part of your day while you toil on your responding diatribe about my "mental illness."  You get that off of WebMD?  A welcomed Thrusday chuckle at work.  Kudos!

I was effected.  My account was Basic Verification for 6 months.  I tried to do Enhanced Verification today and my documents went out.  It said it would take 10 minutes.  I've been going back for hours and it just keeps saying that there was an error and I should upload docs again, but does not give me the option to.  I put in a ticket, but I'm sure I won't hear back anytime soon.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:02:02
I don't think it was that sophisticated.  I think this dude, if this is real, was just being stupid.  No technique needed from the offender.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:37:54
Yeah, personally, I do use both.  Coinbase for the scheduled buys, and Gemini for my manual buys.  
Gemini allows you to trade immediately.  It only allows 500 bucks via ACH per day, unfortunately.  So, I usually build up a bit of a USD nestegg for large purchases, but for flash drops, you can go and put 500 in instantly.
Coinbase makes you wait until the money clears from your bank into your account and takes FOREVER.

Put it on my ledger and engrave the passcode on my cock-ring.

@_date: 2017-10-24 17:49:30
Fuck that.  Go Gemini.  Coinbase rapes you with fees.  But if you do get into Coinbase, set up an ACH transfer.  Then, transfer your USD over to GDAX(This is free because Coinbase owns it) so you can do limit buys and get it at a decent price.  On Coinbase you can only buy at market value, plus high fees.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:32:12
I started over from scratch, so I got a new address....I took everything back off onto other wallets, fixed it, and then transferred it back.  It cost me some in transaction fees, but so much better than loosing thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:00:29
Well, I didn't wanna tell the kid that right off the bat and have him going and buying BTC at market value at 19.99% APR + extra coinbase fees.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:05:30
Do it.  I had a bad feeling about mine, and went back and checked.  I was sure i wrote down everything correctly.  Sure enough, something didn't take and I couldn't recover my wallet.  Thank god I redid the whole process and checked it to make sure.  I would suggest doing so.
