Thanks for the description and the demonstration.

We could hack bitcoin.consider.it a bit to get an answer to this, if people think it is of high enough value to answer. Here's what it could look like. 
    Proposals                   Opinions
    • ~~~~~                 - ----------- + 
    • ~~~~~                 - ----------- + 
    ...
    Blocksize survey           Opinions
    • ...in 6 months      1mb ----------- 16mb 
    • ...in 1 year        1mb ----------- 16mb 
    • ...in 2 years       1mb ----------- 16mb 
The system might be a little clunky, and you don't get precise numbers for the supported MBs, but you probably get 95% of the value of the survey you propose.

Specifically, proposals are ranked by the sum of opinions, not the average opinion. Every opinion is on a scale [0,1].
This means that proposals that have a lot of people weakly supporting it can be ranked higher than a proposal with a couple people strongly supporting it.
In the future, we will empower users to select their own preferred ranking function.
