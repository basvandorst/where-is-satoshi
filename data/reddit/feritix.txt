Five hours now. I would give an hourly update for you if I weren't going to bed, but I'll keep you posted when I wake up.

I don't have an Electrum wallet. I've been trying to figure out how to CPFP for the Schildbach Bitcoin wallet almost all day now.
Edit: the problem has seemed to fix itself. Suffice to say I will look into switching wallets.

My wallet doesn't have an option to allow spending to unconfirmed outputs :/

Thank god it's not days. If I would have known the blockchain was going to be this backed up I would have selected priority instead of standard fee.

How long do you think it will take for these two transactions to go through?
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:28:23
So let me get this straight, you send a small amount of bitcoin to the wallet address from which you are trying to make the stuck payment?

Well it went through finally. Now I know I got to pay higher a miner's fee next time.
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:38:20
I have two.
Based on the fee how long do you think it will take?

Same here. I've been waiting for almost three hours. This is the longest I've ever had to wait.
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:13:08
How would one do that?

So after 72 hours of no confermations the bitcoins will be refunded?
