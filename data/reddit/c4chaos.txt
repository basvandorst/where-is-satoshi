awesome tutorial! thanks for putting this together. 
one small addition for those who will back up their paper wallets in the cloud (i.e. by printing to PDF): make sure to encrypt that PDF file (e.g. using AES Crypt or Truecrypt, or Disk Utility for Mac OS/X users). use a damn strong pass phrase with lower/upper case and special characters.
that is all. i'll share it with everyone i know.

that was probably one of the best Joe Rogan podcasts ever which has real world implications.
Andreas is the voice of the soul of Bitcoin. and that's why he won't get invited to any regulatory hearing :)

i admire Andreas's humble yet powerful response.
but i also appreciate gist of this thread. i agree that the Bitcoin community doesn't need a "centralized" PR firm, but how about a decentralized PR effort? for example, there could be PR *nodes* which function as swift clearing house to counter FUD on the mainstream media. heck, if the Bitcoin community can take swift action when a mining pool is nearing 50% then coordinated PR nodes are doable!
initially the PR nodes can be the biggest start up companies like Blockchain, BitPay, Coinbase, and Bitcoin Foundation. it doesn't mean that they will be the only groups that will speak for Bitcoin. but what these PR nodes can do are 1) coordinate swift responses to mainstream media by correcting, clarifying, and dispelling misinfo and disinfo, 2) formulate clear and simple talking points to disseminate to the public. 
as for the rest of us, our responsibility in countering FUD are 1) relax and not sell off :) 2) understand the issue at hand, 3) use whatever social media clout we have to spread the right message to all our contacts, 4) take it to Twitter.
for example, here's what I did recently when i read an erroneous article about transaction malleability on the LA TIMES: i corrected the article on my FB page by pointing to a technical article, then looked up the Twitter handle of the author of the erroneous article and corrected him on Twitter.
if there's some kind of coordinated PR nodes, then i envision that representatives from the different startup companies i mentioned above would directly and swiftly contact the editors of major publications to correct articles which are spreading FUD about Bitcoin. imagine if Blockchain, Coinbase, BitPay, etc. would do PR blitz every time major mainstream media publish something stupid about Bitcoin, then next time they would think twice before publishing stupid stuff about Bitcoin :)

Hi Matt,
when I was first getting started with cryptocurrencies, i spent an entire Saturday watching all these lectures on Udemy. i'm glad i did because I've learned most of what I know today from that course! also watch the talks by Andreas Antonopoulos on YouTube and listen to Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast. godspeed on spreading the good news and educating the masses.

deploy a false flag attack first. once the price plunges, then they'll buy low. that's how it's done folks ;)
