My intro book was The Age of Cryptcurrency, and I highly recommend it

Literally saw one inside a grocery store in Houston, TX.

Maybe he can sell as his needs come, not all at once.

I love the site, been using it for like two weeks. I actually just created my own account to track my portfolio.
One thing I can't get is under "transactions," I can't add that I had traded LTC to BTC. It'll only let me add that I bought crypto with fiat.

I smell a Terminator reboot. We could even have a traditional investment banker as the terminator or something.

Waka in r/Bitcoin AND r/Vegan, crazy to see him venture to these things from O Let’s Do It

Scott's Cheap Flights sends out specials to Japan occasionally. Best of luck!

That's the same font for Drake's If You're Reading This It's Too Late, right?

Make that two of us. Even donated a couple bucks to help him get further

Is there a source where I could inform myself on the kind of taxes I'd have to pay on crypto returns?

This is my thinking. He could use bitcoin as a means to an end, not the end itself. Pay off the loans completely, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, or whatever will feel like the bitcoin was for SOMETHING not just to accumulate wealth. He could still buy bitcoin with what he would have been paying his loans with.

Yes, IMO it's better to accumulate wealth towards something rather than aimlessly accumulating wealth with bitcoin, which is not guaranteed to begin with. 
Then keep accumulating bitcoin with what he would have used to pay his loans with, to meet the next goal.

Congrats on that!

What about AI?

I also recommend The Age of Cryptocurrency. I LOVE that book. I have yet to read The Truth Machine (same authors), but I'm equally excited.

Profits are more measure by the percentage return, not the amount. The amount is determined by the amount you put in. By percentage, it going from $10 to $12 is the same as $1000 to $1200, just less sexy.
