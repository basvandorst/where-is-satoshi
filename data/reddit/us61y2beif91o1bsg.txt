$8? Bro do you even segwit? I havent paid more the 1$ for months!
Edit: to be clear, just use a wallet that supports segwit addresses and move your coin there. Ledger and trezor and many other wallets support this.

So i agree. But also you gotta research your banks for fiat. Using BofA or WellsFargo or Chase is just asking to get fucked. Find a credit union! They are non profit and often work together on a CU network.

Those are rookie numbers. You got to pump up those numbers!

Hijacking top comment to say SWITCH TO A CREDIT UNION FOR FIAT! The amount of people complaining about wells, bofa, etc banks blocking transactions are doing it wrong anyways. For profit banks suck, duh. CUs are non profit and democratic and dont provide loans to fucked up corps. I was at wellsfargo for years till i learned they invest in war, guns, the far right, the far left, everything fucked up. CUs invest locally and are nonprofit and often work together. So happy i switched years ago. Still stoked to be in bitcoin and my CU isnt blocking any transactions to exchanges because they dont have an agenda other than helping me and their constituents instead of a group of CEO stakeholders.

Not to mention none of their recent merges to master have passed CI tests. Blatantly ignoring failure isn't too comforting.
