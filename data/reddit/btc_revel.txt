yes, if seen from the perspective of one person
Scenario1: starting from now, not one private person buys a bitcoin miner
Scenario2: Let's say, some additional 100.000 private bitcoiners (yes, that is a lot, but why not) start hashing with 1kW.
Now if something bad happens, like Chinese/US/... government decides to ... (many possible things can be imagined here).
I would guess, that the Bitcoin would be less fragile in scenario2.
Less fragile probably means a better store of value.
Therefore every holder of bitcoin would profit from scenario2 in my opinion.
Yes, those who do not mine would equally profit. But as it would be a zero sum game to start mining with 16nm chips, the more people do, the more decentralized it gets again, and all profit, no one looses.
@_date: 2016-08-31 19:40:53
the 21.co model should still work... because liquid cooling of a central authority like vinay talks about, would still be more costly than someone having a couple of chips hashing that do not need cooling at all because the heat dissipation of couple of watts is not a problem or even used to heat some water or so

the idea of an expiration date sounds good

But it would be nice if they could publicize a donation address for "general projects" and for "technical projects". The could use the sum of all these small donations to the most pressing / time critical project / unfunded project and make a short monthly report telling where the donation went. As long as people like the decisions made, they can continue to donate. No guarrantee. Just voluntarily donations.
I know I would donate from time to time!
I believe a couple of thousand silent readers in this subreddit would do the same.

You pay a (big on-chain) fee to open the channel BUT you can then use it to pay many different things at different merchants/services in the following days/weeks/months. So the real fee is “fee/amountsOfPaymentsMadeInThoseWeeks“ which is obviously way smaller (at least if you make more than one payment a week not just to that shop but through that channel)
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:55:52
it is not the kind/class of example I was speaking of, because I think that BIP38 is not a protocol feature, but built on top, so it would be independent of changes made to bitcoin.
If you keep your encrypted wallet in a secured environment (or on dropbox... bad idea... but  don‘t get hacked) and encyption in bip38 gets insecure, then you might not be affected I guess (or are the same cryptographic primitives usedbin bitcoin? I don‘t think so...)

The good thing is that it give's us some pressure to find and implement other solutions like Lightning-Network/Sidechains, ...
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:57:44
interesting burried post:
My opinion:
let's find consensus for 4 MB blocks on the main blockchain starting with the reward halving 2016 and doubling every 4 years with the reward halving (or linear interpolation in between).
This won't be enough in case of a major crisis in either Argentina, Venezuela, Greece, ... but it will help and work on lightning-networt, sidechains, ... are underway
@_date: 2015-06-12 01:26:50
I partly agree. But worst we can do, is to have a real long lasting fork. Some devs that have done much and continue to do important stuff (like but not only Greg Maxwell with Sidechains Elements) are talking about not following if the blocksize gets to big.
And according to [Metcalfe's law]( the network effect is  proportional to n^2. So let's not have a long lasting fork. Let's work together. Let's try to find consensus before launching a hard fork.
I know that some might say that 20 MB is already a compromise/trade-off. But if some (and not so few devs) seem to find that it is to much, let's just find another compromise.
I don't really know myself. I would also love 20 MB blocks.
But I have to admit, that a bitcoin with 1 MB will be very hard to censor. And that is the biggest strength of bitcoin. So let's keep this in mind and all agree that 4 MB should be reasonably low bump bandwith wise even for the large part of the asia region, but big enough to make bitcoin that settlement network in the next few years, and then see where and how far moore's and nielsen' laws bring us to eventually (!) allow every transaction on the blockchain.
Let's be strong together!
Let's find a solution that both sides can kind of agree on, even if not perfect (it doesn't need to be absolutely perfect as nobody knows the absolut perfect solution... in a crisis we can still make necessary changes) end most of the debate,  and refocus on SW solutions (sidechains Elements sound so cool and a path to knew innovations and help the lightning network be architectured, so please let's MOVE ON soon!)
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:07:13
but it MIGHT not have come to the clever solution of Garzik, if Gavin/Hearn had been happy about things, or just made one post every 6 month on the subject asking if other are on board. Some solutions need other pointing at the problem, and then someone comes up with a good idea.
It is unfortunate that things are not easier... I would be happy if all this seemingly-never-ending-discussion wouldn't take so long, but each side has it pros and cons, and both are important! Without one of both sides, trying (genuinely in my opinion) to make bitcoin successful, some fruitful discussions, ideas and solutions would be missed

A lot more source of errors and potential threat of viruses especially for newbies / non experienced users:
- secure generation of private keys (must be sure, that the tool doesn't communicate your private key, specially a concern with some vanity generators)
- be sure that no unknown virus reads your private key
- potential errors with "change addresses" when spending from paper wallets

Or might it be smarter to have an online spreadsheet?
Where we divide work (one writes down the twitter username, one makes a short history check, another writes down if a tip has been given by anyone)

First of all: respect for bringing out a paper
I can not comment on most aspects brought up in the paper as I have not read the entire paper yet, and maybe do not have the time to analyze it in detail in the coming days, but I am an engineer and look also at the bigger picture (asic costs, cost gravity, embedded electronics, ...)
1) 
I do see the benefits sidechains could bring
I do also see the risk mentioned by Peter Todd coming from (even slightly more) centralization (I 
I am the first person to defend bitcoin, when people criticize PoW, the energy wasted, and the growing centralization of mining. Not because I just want to blindly  believe in bitcoin, or that I don't care about our planet, but for a REASON:
Because in the LONG TERM, bitcoin has the promise to be very decentralized. The centralization might be a MID-term problem (for a couple of years until ASICs reach a plateau), but only IF EVERYTHING is done to keep the incentives as decentralized as possible. In the long term, when ASIC have reached a plateau (5nm asic-processes, and optimization of placement and parallelization), it would be easy to compete with HUGE centralized bitcoin miners, BECAUSE of HEAT DISSPATION and the possibility to embed mini-miners in electronic devices in a way that average Joey would not know (ASIC would be really cheap because build in millions of units -&gt; millions of people could have water-heater that integrate some percent of heat from bitcoin-miners or fridges that use the heat to run a stirling-engine or peltier-Effect/thermoelectric-Cooling or exess of roof-solar power - that can not be stored - used to mine). 
The benefit of free heat dissipation for the average Joey has NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN !! It would be enough if 1 Billion people that live in the modern world JUST mine on AVERAGE 2 Watts. It would be immensly difficult to have one entity surmount this hurdle. Does 1 Billions sound a lot? Yes, if the consumer would need to want to mine. But not if a 100$ electronic product does cost 50 cent more and you don't even know it mines (for whatever reason, or because it might pay some small part of the energy it consumes, with bitcoin it mines). The heat dissipation is a huge benefit that we private decentralized folks have. We do not need to pay rent for place to put miners, we do not need to cool miners (we USE that heat !!!), we do not need to pay people securing the area, we do not need... (like cars today do not need a chauffeur anymore, or our laptops do not need a maintainer changing vacuum tubes)
BUT this does only work, if DECENTRALIZATION-incentives are the BIG goals in the long-term.
Decentralization is not a feature, it will be the key element if Bitcoin will work in the long term (and in some way in the mid-term, because technical savyy people - that will explain the benefits to the rest of the population - will look in the future/long-term). So I do not know all the consequences of sidechains, and I REALLY like the benefits that sidechain might bring, but I care for the risks of merged-minig if it leads to slightly less decentralization, so PLEASE, do not take the decentralized aspect lightly (I know I repeated this word many times, but it makes bitcoin what it is!)

$1 for you @_date: 2014-12-16 22:21:12
Generate some money with low investment by mining if you don't pay for power?
In this case I guess yes (doing some simple math), BUT
- you would need an ASIC miner (like S3/S4/C1 from Antminer, so low investment means at least 200$)
- you would need to mine in a pool
- not only the BTC-price needs to be kind of stable for an amount of time but also the hash-rate (or a stable ratio) so that you have time to return your investment
- minig equipment delivered no too late (if not, you can loose all your investment, but Antminer is apparently getting good at delivery on time it seems)
- cheap energy (which seems to be your case) for a longer time period
If you want to mine in your home, beware of the noise, but the  Antminer C1 should be designed for that.
I don't like to advise people to mine, but those with free power of course have a big advantage (like many people in Paris who heat with electricity, and could mine instead of using a heater... but even there you can only do this in the winter)

Waxwing did the correct thing, and commented and quoted the article, and I would tend to agree on most points.
Why "Gregory's" Roadmap? Why insinuate that people here do not have their own well informed opinioin?
Quoting the article:




=&gt; Sometimes I get the feeling that those who want the scaling doesn't  do or doesn't want to do their work (of testing).
Of course I know that such a thing is not always priority 1 on the roadmap of a company, but then don't complain.
Of course we could just raise the 1mb limit first, but wouldn't those companies put the testing even more on the low priority list, if they don't even test it, when the even say they are affected by the current situation!! Wouln't most ask just for one more raise, because the last raise was good (if it turn's out good), and one more until it is one too much because the system got really centralized this time, because full nodes only ran on data-center hardware.

One miner needs MAXIMUM one full node (zero if if he mines for a pool that is not his own one), and a computer being able to validate 5, 10 or 20 MB shouldn't cost that much in 2016, even for the average  hobbyist. Maybe we really should find consensus on a soft-limit like 2 MB blocks for 2016 and 4 MB for 2017, with a hard-limit a bit higher (like 2 times higher). 
2 or 4 MB won't be enough in the eyes of Coinbase/Circle/... so I guess the pressure to find solutions like Lightning-Network and malleability fixes will still be there, but will allow for some small growth until LN or the likes are ready. 
I agree that the solution to the blocksize problem is harder than I first thought. The risk of governements not only regulating the fiat-exchanges but also full-nodes is much easyier in a not-so-decentralized-bitcoin-world-of-let-say-100MB-Blocks.
IMO, Coinbase, Circle, ... should invest a slightly bigger amount in dev/research of how to fix malleabiliy and making LN acutally work. Of course this costs money, but maybe plans of bigger adoption just need to be pushed 1-2 years back, to achieve the bigger goals. 
It is true, that I don't know how much they invest in devs fixing malleability, ... but it doesn't seem to be that much. Or they just could buy StrawPay... or we - the community - should make a big mulit-level-bounty (with lighthouse) so that StrawPay open-sources their solution

In my opinion a 240 GB SSD is plenty enough, even for running bitcoin in 5 years and having scaled to bigger blocks.
I would not be enough to be an [archival full node]( but enough for a (pruned) full node. Remember, from the security perspective, a pruned full node is not worse in any way (neither for the user, nor for the network-health), as full means that it has verified all transactions in the blockchain (but has deleted/pruned the data that it won't need anymore but keeps all information that is afforded for maximum security, i.e. unspent-tx-outputs).
A pruned full node can be as small as 2 GB today (this will grow as more users join the network, but not as fast as the complete blockchain).
So a pruned full node that stores the last 20 GB is helping a lot the network, plentyful in my opinion (50 GB even better, and above 100 GB just perfect).
Of course it is great if some people can have complete archival full nodes, but it isn't as important and we don't need as much of those and they don't need to be decentralized if they don't relay unspent transcation, therefore archival nodes could be run in masses from data-centers. 
A lot of decentralized full nodes that relay unspent transactions are important, but being archival or pruned is not so important.
But of course, you are right, the price still matters. But not so much the size (at least not for most users).

@_date: 2017-03-20 19:15:13
The correct way to see if LN is good for miners:
Worldwide, there is a need for **many millions** transactions per hour. And very probably many many billions when we'll have new use cases with IoT / autonomous robots / eventually payPerSecondStreamedVideo automated paying of websites per page visit /...
=&gt; For economic reasons, these many billions of transcations will happen, on the technology that has
the best trade-off between 
* best store-of-value
* cheapest transactions
but in this case of course "cheapest-transactions" is **BY FAR** the more important factor (when it comes to where the billions of transactions will take place).
Obviously billions of transactions per hour won't be able to be on-chain. So other crypto-currencies will be used for that
=&gt; inronically, bitcoin-miners will get even less fees
I think big blockers are right, that middle-to-long term Bitcoin is much stronger, if a big chunck of world-wide transactions is done through it. But I fear, that they underestimate the volume the world will need in 10-30 years.
Would it be in the same order of magnitude as today: ok, maybe on-chain-transactions COULD be the solution ONE DAY. But there will be A LOT more transactions (because of a LOT of new use cases that were not possible with PayPal/Visa because of high chargebacks) -&gt; without 2nd-Layer solutions Bitcoin MIGHT be dead in 5-15 years (if a another cryptocurrency achieves to be secure+2ndLayerTransactions)

Another choice would be the stake holders. I do not mean the miners but the people, the Bitcoin holders (voting by signature).
I am not suggesting this as the solution, just enumerating one more choice. One problem here is: should all Bitcoin holders inform themselves all the time if voting is imminent? How long should a vote like this last (Ethereum had a VERY short vote before the controversial hard fork)? Do I risk to loose my coins if I make a world trip of 1 year and do not follow the news?

nobody said it would become worthless.
But with gold you can't do microtransactions for example, and bitcoin will highly probably be better for that example use case.
Another example. With what would you prefer to flee a country like Venezuela or Syria, if you had... say $5000? (knowing that at the borders everyone is in a very bad situation and would rob you just to get something to eat). With gold in your pocket, with fiat in your pocket or with crypto/bitcoin (and a backup shared with 2 family members, protected by a password)?
You might prefer gold, or fiat. I wouldn't.

Don't try to mix the words.
The question was not if it can be used as electronic cash but if the small amounts of electronic cash should happen pure on chain or settled on chain.
Satoshi (your are linking to) liked payment channels and implement what was necessary to make them work:
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:11:13
dig up older stuff... yes, not hard... it started right in 2010 ;)
The big-block-camp will say: yes, but satoshi said we can raise the limit when we need.
That's true, he said that. But he was also reluctant to change it before it is needed! ("We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it"). So it seems that he was already sensible to the trade-offs, even at a time where the mining was very decentralized!
Bitcoin-Core is acting pretty near in that regard (but remember it is a group of talented programmers, not a company with one opinion). The opinion was that raisining the limit was not needed in 2014-2015 for example, as blocks where not full at that time (= we can change it later). Then beginning in 2015-2016 they said that a solution is needed, and finally delivered segwit that solves a couple of problems and as a side-effect increases the transaction per second throughpout. It could have come handy a couple of weeks/months earlier, but polishing and testing was not finished. Now it is he big block camp that fight the scalability solution right when it is the most neede.
(Of course after 2010 the blocksize debate never died, it just got through different intensity waves, and even [soft-limit were introduced]( raised, debated, and later not seen as good enough. Interesting stuff is dynamic-block-size/flexcaps as is it will be needed for sure)

I see, but wouldn’t it be an idea then to have a fall back to neutrino style light node in those cases (when your or average-Joes-uncles full nodes aren’t available)?
As you see I am not completely against Neutrino (and until yesterday I was even talking much about it as awsome new tech that’s a lot better than todays SPV, at the very least for privacy), but trying now to find other solutions.
For the connection of average joe to his techy uncle becoming a regular thing, I think that some work should be put into 1-click configuration, like writing a whatsapp message...

Interesting, here's a quote from Adam:
"Hal Finney had suggested an improvement to HashCash, the original HashCash didn't have a leading zero based collision, it had a different kind of collision"
The more I hear people talk about Hal, the more I find it difficult to believe that Hal was not involved in the creation of Bitcoin. 
But anyway, Hal's gone (but only from crypto to [cryo]( though :)
And even if he was not involved, it seems to be sure that he was the second Bitcoin user and since the ["youtube-video of the shirtless dancing guy"]( it's well known how important the first follower is.

That is not true. If other crypto-currencies would have better 2nd-layer-solutions (for whatever reason), then they would fit in there.
2nd-layer solution in bitcoin, are still bitcoin (they are multisig+hashLockTime), but **bundled**
=&gt; better privacy + less space on-chain (I prefer havin 10 coffees bundled in two-transactions, than 10 transactions that fill the blockchain).
Of course I will be happy to be able to make many on-chain transactions, but even with my coffees bundled that means a giantic blockchain with huge amount of fees for the miners.

how can one expect the fees to evolve long term on liquid? I mean what is the free pressure mechanism? Does the liquid chain has a max blockweight or something similar? And if yes, how high is it (in comparison to 4000 for bitcoin)? Should it get really popular would you create a couple of those (with benefits and disadvantages it has, but at least I won't have to verify terabyte blocks)?
I am sorry I don't know much about liquid yet, I do hope my questions still does make sense... (I do know that liquid is a federated sidechain, I do think that liquid has blocks that gets merkelized and put in the bitcoin blockchain)

No, not because segwits was conceived in 2016 ;) The mining difficulty readjusts every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks). And 2016 blocks / two weaks is a good amount of time, not too short, not too long.
When we get 95% segwit  in average at the end of a 2016 block period, it would need another 2016 blocks for the activation/mining of segwit blocks, letting all involved parties know, that in about 2 weeks the first segwit blocks could be

Microtransactions are possible with payment channels. Here something to read:
Payment channels will be even more useful in the form of Lightning-Network. Please do not begin with "Lightning-Network is not bitcoin".But if this really your opinion, then get curious and ask around, and try understanding it, not just repeating what some other (detractors?) say. I might make a website or just a blog post explaining it in an easy fashion. 
Simply said, lightning allows for temporary-off-chain-bitcoin-transactions that can become on-chain at any time! (you, the receiver, decide which amount you want to batch together, before sending it on-chain)! Making some analogy: The cash that a shop accepts... it is like off-chain-banking... and it becomes on-chain-banking when an employee bring it to the bank. Only that in the old-world cash (off-chain) is kind of better, and in the crypto-world on-chain is the key.

I see the point of Nicolas. He is not saying "everyone should run his own full node", but something like "if you don't run a full node, find someone you trust and connect to their node". I guess that nowdays everyone knows a tech-guy for whom running a node shouldn't be a problem. At least in the western world.
Things get more complicated in real 3rd world countries... so maybe Neutrino-alone (without full-node counter-check) is a good solution for them... maybe... not sure actually... but the western-world should not get week and have neutrino-tech increase the trust we put into miners (by decreasing the amount of full nodes run by average joe... because average joe does know a techy or two he can trust today!

Not a perfect response, but here a quote from an investor in Blockstream Brian Hoffmann (he talks mainly about sidechains, but also generally about moving bitcoin and its ecosystem forward):
[...] And that’s why I’m participating in this first-round financing as an individual investor, and why Blockstream itself will function similarly to the Mozilla Corporation. Here, our first interest is maintaining and enhancing Bitcoin’s strong open ecosystem. And the structure we’ve chosen will give us the freedom and flexibility to prioritize public good over returns to investors." [...]

The reason informed people call it more of a scam than litecoin is because of some influential people who were/are heavily involved in it (very dishonest + probably backdoor mining software + going as far as patenting critical pieces on a techology stack that fight closed patents as much as possible if one knows the implications it has... just google „asic boost“). 
Then again I understand what you mean with two solutions fighting against each other (it is often very good)... just a pitty that it is led by people with low standards (proably just profit driven... which is ok, but only if people that get newly involved know that it has not the same ideals, not same goals of decentralization and freeing people)

thanks, but I didn't came up first with that analogy.
Here I am mainly trying to make the point clear, that in the analogy it doesn't behave like your private cache in your PC, but a **shared** cache (between at least you and the other party). I am emphazising the "shared" here, because many new redditors seem to think that lightning transactions are not real transactions, and I think part of that is that they heared cache and then think ok, so maybe person A won't send what they have in their cache. But isn't so... it acts like a shared cache, and person B can take the temporary amount (signed mirco-contract) written in the shared cache and transmit it to bitcoin-network (on-chain)
So if anything is new, it is the word "shared" added to the cache analogy, and maybe the stream of signed micro-contracts (but not sure about that... probably other have described it that way). Anyway, I hope someone could make a video out of those and more analogies.

"[...] the channel closes. [...]" ?
I guess you are asking the wrong question.
In your example, with 1000 users, there would not be "the channel", but many channels. At least one per person who wants to use LN. Or maybe this is your question, but then be more precise. "The" is not really precise.
Lightning is a network of channels. Routing nodes, would have many open channels at once.
I don't have time yet, but someone should take the time to make a great video about it. Some facts/analogies should help:
- a channel will need at least 2 on-chain transactions in its whole life time (if I am not mistaken, the payment-channels in the "old" implementation of bitcoinj needed more than 2 transactions)
- you begin with locking up some coins in a multisig transaction with a time expiration (the reason why a channel is between two parties and not thousands). In short, HLTC
- imagine a payment channel like a mix of a) **a cache** (e.g. a lot can be written very fast, but not all must me copied immediately to the hard-drive analogy) **that you share with your channel-partner/receiver** and b) **a stream of signed micro-contracts** sent to that shared cache (every micro-contract takes some increasing amount from the locked coins and make it spendable to the other part, thus replacing the previous micro-contract) =&gt; Any ONE of those micro-contracts is valid through the complete lifetime of the channel and the other part can decide at any time to send one of those micro-contracts to the bitcoin-network, so obiously, when he does, he will use the last/biggest one
- lightning network is network of channels making it possible to pay someone with whom  you don't have a channel open (A to C), because A has a channel open with B, and B one open with C, and B routes the payment from A to C
- ... (will continue when more time... have to do some stuff now...)
Oh, back to your questions, assuming that you meant it that way. 1) If the channel of one user closes, than only one (the second/closing transaction) gets added to a block.
2) If the channel of a routing node of bigger operator closes, then.... I guess it has as a direct consequence... the same as 1) ... the closing transaction of that channel gets added to that block (but it helped clear a lot of chained-micor-contracts).
Ok, I hope the analogies are not too bad, and my explanations not too wrong, because I have to dive deeper in the subject... this is what I understand from just reading the bitcoin news...
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:34:17
correct: if you had *and would keep* 100% of hashpower
Even if you had 100% hashpower, you couldn‘t keep 100% if you mined on the genesis block, so the longest chain would still grow and a lot of new miners would enter and it would take a lot longer to catch up, making it quite impractical to do (unless you have kind of unlimited ressources like states have)
but the stat is still interesting as a ball park figure

@_date: 2016-12-14 21:46:38


no, not at all


There's no real realtionship. A pruning full node is still a full node, just not an [archival full node]( It verifies all consensus rules and then deletes what it doesn't need anymore (but for example keeps all data to calculate account balances!)
A SPV-Node can have many different forms. A good form would be one where it is connected to a full node you know you can trust (like your node at home). But most forms do not verify all consensus rules, and here you can read the problems it provokes if too many users do that:

The difference is, that 
- if robbers break in other houses, it doesn't really affect you
- if miners attack other people (that only run SPV), it might very well affect you if this group of people is big, because suddenly those people can't pay you as your wallet wouldn't accept those transactions, and creates a mess instead of a fungible and usable currency (especially if there are many different level of SPV-wallets, meaning that you do not only get two but get different groups each not accepting other transactions). A mess would affect bitcoin-the-transaction-system and therefore bitcoin-the-store-of-value.

most of what you said is right, but I think you might mix up what compact blocks are. Or at least you mix up two ways to call something as they are typically named in the bitcoin world (if we follow BIPs at least).
Now I undestand what you mean. When you say compact blocks you meant „compact filters“ (yes some times called „compacked block filters“, but still filters).
Note that „compact blocks“ and „compact (block) filters“ are two different things.
Compact blocks were existing before the neutrino concept and are used by full nodes to reduce bandwith by knowing that you have a mempool with many uncofirmend transactions and thus give you a file with which you can reconstruct a freshly mined block with their help. I think those compact blocks are not the same for every peer-pair, but depend of the prediction other peers make of your mempool. More infos here:

maybe not exactly at the peak, but the highest volume have always been around peaks. And when I say „the highest volumes“ I mean by FAR the biggest part of the volume in some periode
So actually yes, it feals for many that they bought at peak. But wait a new cycle and you‘re happy that it was just a local peak (at least it was the case until now)... just need to be patient (if your informed analysis still tells you that the signs are good)

true, but the average fee is a very bad measure (not your fault... the fault of the chart maker).
Some big enterprises are ready to pay 1€ or more per transaction to have their (most non-financial) transaction be saved in the public immutable bitcoin blockchain. But lot less (like 1-5 cent would most of the time be enough to have it included in the next 1-5 blocks.

Mining at home is good for decentralization of the network, but at this point in time it is in most cases not profitable (unless you have near free electricity). Mining at home used to be profitable, and may be profitable again in the future, when we move away from ASIC that produce non-used heat to ASICs that are embedded in home appliances that need to produce heat (or cooling with peltier-elements) anyway (like water-heater, fridge, ...).

The problem with that method is that all sub-accounts (after „log-in“) would share the same seed, so you can not (easily) give directives to different family how to withdraw only their part.

Dollar cost averaging has been not a bad strategy.
In hindsight many times it would have been good to invest a lot more quicker, and some times it would have been good to wait (like in the last 12+ months). But in hindsight everything's easy. 
I would say dollar cost averaging is mostly better than buying nothing (because cryptos tend to rise suddenly), but sometimes not as good as buying more when it feels low. So at least dollar cost average if you have an informed opinion on the subject of cryptos/bitcoin and think it has a good future

I guess you know already that there are 144 bitcoin blocks per day (24hours * 6 blocks per hour) or is your username just a coincidence? Anyway...
Getting informed is for sure a good decision. Sometimes it can be easier to begin by investing a tiny amount (by western amounts) like 50$. After that you have « skin in the game » and it is often a lot more motivational to read more about it.
Would like to explain some more, but I am on mobile... and there is so much stuff written out there already.
I recommend older videos from Andreas Antonopoulos. Or Saifedean Ammous Book « Bitcoin Standard ». Or there are many good podcasts out there (let me know if you want more infos like podcasts or so).
I think it would be great to come back with more specific questions. The value of Bitcoin is hard to predict. Obviously, most of us in this subreddit think that it has good chances to rise. It is very asymmetrical (could rise a LOT, but the chance to fall as much as it could rise is seen much less likely). If it is gets as big as gold (just gold...), it would already rise by a factor of 40!

If bitcoins becomes more valuable (like you suggest the possibility at the end of you message), then merchants might also want to get some. They might prefer discounting their products slightly for those paying in bitcoins instead of paying a fee to an exchange to aquire those.
So the desire of some (e.g. merchants) to get something becoming more valuable might counter balance the reduced desire of others to spend / get rid of their bitcoins.

why would I want to hold other currency if bitcoin gets widely adopted (and thus a lot more stable).
With gold/silver the reason was that gold is not that easily divisible in small day to day peaces for example to buy a piece of bread. Silver had a reason to be.

it won't be 5 TH, but it doesn't need to be that much. If you make more than without, you win. Even if you and the manufacturer win only infinitesimally more, it is still a small win in money earned, and big (I mean huge) in decentralized money.

In my opinion focus more on how/where you store your bitcoins.
For people not very familiar with how to do a safe cold storage, I would recommend a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger, but Trezor has some advantages like own screen; until the ledger-blue comes out).
If you look at it long-term (and that is what you should do if you consider inversting in bitcoin), the +/- 20$ won't change much, but loosing them in 5 years because of a virus/lost-password/... might hurt you a lot more (therefore my advice of a hardware wallet)
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:08:53
No, you should look at it in a log[arithmic] scale (like all things that behave exponentially):
What you can see better here is how long it takes to double or get 10x bigger. And you see that at times bitcoin did grew faster (the curve was steeper at some moments). You also see that the corrections were bigger... so volatility does seem to decrease

What do you do if the chain with most cummulative difficulty oscillates? Do your number of Btc in your wallet also oscillate back and forth?
You can choose a set of rules (core or b2x or whatever) but not: „have no fix rules and just choose the most cummulative difficulty“.
This nonsense. Never thought these guys can come with such xxx. It just does not make sense

He is likely to have 10s or 100s of thousands of BTC, but commonly reported 1 million is absolutely unsure (not unlikely, but totally mot a sure fact).

That it! The average user don't make informed choices, they take what they find in the store. Ok, Apple is liked a lot these days, but it more fashion that technical choice. I just say that in the long run, projects with open-source at their core will win and be in the front line in stores (Apple and specially iOS is a closed garden to me, but is till has a lot of open-source in it like safari and much more... , so already more than microsoft at its prime).
Android is a smartphoneOS today, but it will either become much more than that, or ChomeOS (or similar project) will take over.
Windows had a head start, that was easy to hold for some time, as almost all SW in the 90s were written for Microsoft and big company's move very slowly with their IT-Systems, but this head start is melting.
Look at where the pace and innovation is. I guess you've heared of Android-Auto, Android-Brillo, project ARA, ...

what some (rather smart) people in that space say, is that it is in China's government best interest to not shut the down! Because it is likely that Bitcoin won't dissappear because of that but go underground, where they can not get some informations the might need and for sure get from (centralized) exchanges (like who transferred those 20 million dollars...)

Do not forget to mention that a better short term solution is to bump the fee (replace by fee implemented in quite a few wallets right now) if the network is congested and it does not pass in around 2 hours.
The mid term solution is of course bigger blocks and automatic fee bumping by wallets (like every x minutes or hours the fee get bumped a bit automatically). Segwit would give us bigger block as a side effect of other real important features and fixes, and later we would need even bigger blocks.

In my example, I was talking about devices, that JUST mine (not the internet-of-things scenario).
In this case, your machine would be even CHEAPER to buy. Mining chips would be produced in millions and would cost only a few cents, and the manufacturer would sell more by offering it cheaper and getting some percentage of you mining rewards in return (like it is today with many devices: sell a printer cheap and make profit later with cartridges... only that in the mining case it is a win-win for both!!).
For the Internet-of-things scenario it is less set in stone, but there are still lots of possibilites:
- micropayments channel / lightning network
- special sidechain for microtransactions without much going back and forth
- lots of transactions, so that one individual transactions does not cost so much (would need to be a lot, but who knows how things are in 25 years... early on, people thought there won't be more than 5 computers...)

small info for others:
pruned nodes have the same security as non-pruning nodes, because pruned nodes are full nodes (unlike nowdays SPV wallets) !!
-&gt; pruned nodes 
* ARE full nodes, because they a fully validating all bitcoin rules
* are NOT archival nodes, because they delete information (blocks) that can be disregarded after having verified it (but keeps the utxo set = Unspent Transaction Outputs, for maximum security by checking against it) and thus can not transmit those old blocks to other peers
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:44:34


with bitcoin this is also possible (at a price also... using a third party that acts as a multisig.... and the good thing is that you could choose with which merchant/person/friend you want to pay this additional price for possible complaint resolution, and which one you trust enough so that you prefer to save this additional fee).
With Lightning it should be theoretically also be possible I think

here the post I replied to another user:
The good thing is that the satellites relays bitcoin, and bitcoin is Proof-of-work (POW).
The great thing about POW is that you just need to compare two numbers to know if you have the chain with the most POW.
If it is the case, then you can download the blocks from Blockstream without needing to trust them and verify it yourself.
Downloading a number from another source should be low bandwith and relatively trivial
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:56:26
yes, that's the idea, verify the block with the most POW*. If it isn't valid, try with the block that has the second most POW.
There won't be many invalid blocks, as it costs a lost of energy to produce an invalid block with high POW.
*as Adam mentions it... just download the tiny headers from another source

if they give you 4 min they probably accept 0-confirmations.
I guess the 3 min it took was the time bitstamp needed to sent out the coins (like for most exchanges). Or are they quicker? With an own wallet it would be almost instantaneous (as long as they accept 0-conf)
@_date: 2019-01-25 23:59:25
that’s why many think merchants may start to make discounts for those paying in bitcoins (because if it is true that it is perceived as a value that will get higher, they might want some and could aquire it this way by discounting the sale instead of paying the fee to an exchange).
Simply said... the desire of some to get something increasing in value might counter balance the reduced desire of others to spend
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:49:47
yes, almost same amount of transactions than last year, but very very lower fees:
Anyone can click on the fee ranges [sat/B] on the left side of the chart in the link to filter the lower transactions out. For example if you click on 40-50 sat/B (to hide fees lower than 50 satoshis/Byte) you see that 2018 looks like non existant in comparison

Difference: bitcoin is also a protocol, so the more adoption it gets, the more it "solidifies" (like IPv4 has been here for decades). Fortunately the protocol can and does evolve (see the BIPs on github).
But being a protocol it evolves at a slower pace than standard Software, but much faster than other protocol upgrades like IPv6 adoption for example

I wouldn't call you a Bitcoin Villain, but it makes me very sad we (both sides) couldn't find a common ground.
You are one of the greatest innovators building projects that use crypto in a smart way. I know you mean it well with 2x and in some way it doesn't sound sooo risky (and it has some advantages also), but it can't be ruled out to be a bit risky... some technology pieces don't behave linearly and especially now with quite strong miner centralization. If we are carefull, we could be at the maximum of centralization and work towards decentralizing more again. I know you see the biggest risk lying ahead of us outside of cryptospace but it has to not be forgotten that centralizing mining even more is dangerous step.
Of course blocks need to get bigger over time. And devs surely think about that, look for best ways like flexcaps and so on, but sometimes the good enough solution is not there yet.
If it comes to a fork it would be a pitty to be on kind of two different sides... people will increasingly put names on the other side like Bitcoin Villain (especially when real villains start to try to divide bitcoin folks with dubious forks...) and I really wish this could have been avoided... :(
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:12:23
segwit (No2x) is a cpacity increase of about factor 2 (not exactly because it depends of the type of transactions made in the network, so it is an increase when bc1 will be rolled out of between 1.8 and 4 max).
Segwit2x would have doubled that increase (2 x [1.8 to 4]), but this didn’t reach consensus, which many experts see as positive for various reasons

Most get it the second or third time: just buy now (cost average on couple of month) and just hodl. Nothing more simple and still very very good results if you hodl long enough (seems so until now)
- this was equally for all the bubbles, so the example can be done with price divided by 3 or 10 or 30 or ... the were a lot of those "bubbles" and a lot more to come

true, it's hard to stay out of politics, but you can decide do dedicate your time to other things, and staying out in this way. Still tangent  I admit.
I meant staying out of governance/politics in regards to the Foundation, not in regards to Bitcoin in general.

Seans Outpost seems to have done some great stuff.
AnalyzerX7 is leading the way in terms of transparency, which leverages one new aspect, that was not as easly possible before  bitcoin. Which makes bitcoin the better choice for donations over paypal,... not even talking about the lower fees here!
So, while Analyzer might not have done as much as Seans Outpost yet, he's doing more and more and in a way that "scales" because of the focus on transparency. And even if he stops here, hopefully others will continue where he stopped.
Oh... by the way, the best is not to compare them, that was not my goal, and don't want to a start a diacussion on that level. I just wanted to emphasize, that bitcoin empowers donation-transparency and I am happy to see it used that way.

what do you think about "overhodling"
Meaning: spending some bitcoins (on stuff you would buy with fiat anyway), but always buy more then you spend
=&gt; I am aware about the money-issues / FED-money-printing, ... but spending bitcoins make the bitcoin-network-effect keep growing instead of letting the place to a possible newcomer (because a paypal alternative is also usefull)
Often times extreme examples can illustrate it better:
Let's say, we are just 10 bitcoin enthusiast, understanding that there are money-issues. We hoard/hold for many years, and finally own almost all bitcoins. What have we achieved? I guess not much... any other comparably open cryptocurrency that would get invented and be distributed to more than 10 000 people would be instantaneously more successful. So the amount of involved people is not unimportant. And of course bitcoin has luckily many believers, but if we do not choose to use it also for other usefull purposes like a paypal-alternative, other projects will do that and grow fast, because there are also issues in this area and the userbase is potentially big. The network-effect has to be maintained.
So may advice to all: OVERHODL!!!

- almost all the rest has to come from kind of a consensus and also be lead by the (more technical) community. It would be bad to instore such a thing that nullc is so smart that when he announces something it is a defacto standard that it will be adopted
All please don't forget that a person alone should not be asked to much. It is beginning to be a very big business and wanting decentralization will not be easy, and some people receive death threats, ... -&gt; please do not put pressure on some people that do already do so much (I am speaking to the community not to OP)
But generally I understand your questions!

thanks shaolinfry!!!
In all this mess maybe we have learned something and are better prepared for the longer term. In the end it is through such difficulties that anti-fragile systems (if this exists) get more robust, not when everything goes smoth. Better to have learned this know then in 15 years

the problem is not storage cost but bandwith cost
With pruning you need not much storage (security and all is the same!) but almost the same bandwith

Yes, installing a wallet-SW is very good to better grasp the concepts that some newbie find rather theoretical if not tested.
Consider installing smartphone-Apps, it is much easier for users to scan the QR-codes. A good overview of smartphone-Apps can be found on the bitcoin-wiki-getting-started.
Using Wiper-App might also be nice, because it includes an encrypted-Instant-Messaging-SW... but I find their bitcoin-synchronization strangely slow...

If you install her Wiper (chat-App with bitcoin wallet), message her to ask hows the kid doing, and then next time maybe pay her through it even in advance, then it is more likely that she gets used to the App AND recommend it to her friends (I guess the average non bitcoiner would just not recommend to install a wallet-only-app -&gt; messengers may be the key-factor!!)

with 256 they loose more or less 80% of transactions count, but not 80% of transaction fees. Fees are not linear, right? The top 200 are way higher than the rest

At first I thought "oh no, it can't be possible, that the tip-button (similar to a flattr-button) is not gaining traction, even if only slowly".
Then I read that they wanted to support changetip (because changetip uses coinbase-API) instead of fighting/competing with them.
I am not the big fan of coinbase (though not hating them either... they do what they can in the fiat AML/KYC regulated world), but KUDOS on this decision!!

are the last characters not a checksum?
So if first 4 and last 4 (checksum) are correct, the checksum would give you some probablity, that the middle ones should be right too (no assurance... as checksum can obviously not detect all differences... but checksum + first 4 sounds good).
Maybe the best would be: last 4 chars + random 4 in the middle

We need more people that (over)hodl.
The more people hodl, the more the whales will get weak over time, because to play they will need to sell at some point in time. If we have enough hodlers BUYING more everytime  a whale sales a bunch, they will loose power. But for that we need as much hodlers as possible that keep buying even more, not just hodling... I call it OVERHODLING. For this, people need to work / have an income, even if they already own many bitcoins.
Oh, and by the way... when I say hodling, I DON'T mean that one should not spend bitcoins!! I say that he should buy more bitcoins than he spends! As said, I call that OVERHODLING!
We all need to OVERHODL!!

It depends on which platform/OS.
I find this a good overview:
On Android: mycelium and greenaddress
On iOS: breadwallet and greenaddress
But others are not bad either: Airbitz


Not sure what you are referring to. 
There are two things:
- do not reuse one address many times over and over (this should be fixed by software improvement called HD-wallets [Hierarchical Deterministic] in all major wallets I think)
- do not keep all your bitcoin in one wallet if you have more than a few bucks in it, so that a very rare SW problem or more frequent phishsing does not steal them all
I guess you mean the second point. If you do, then it won't help you to have more than a wallet in the same Software.
If you have just a few bucks, then one good wallet should be enough.
If you have a substantial amount of money, you should consider something called cold-storage!!! Devices like Trezor and the upcoming Leger Blue (ledgerwallet.com/roadmap) are userfriendly tools to do that.
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:37:35


True! But it is a LOT less error prone for a newbie. With Hardware wallets it is hard to do mistakes, but with paper wallet it is quite easy! I have seen engineers mess up with paper wallets. If you don't spend all at once for example.
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:33:45


I think the important part is the OR (first or last).
If you do the last, it automatically means that there is a high probability that the rest is ok (and even higher, if it doesn't know which part you will verify, and therefore not know which part can have a collusion).
I do respect your knowledge, so I know I might be mistaken, just not sure where/why...

It is already common use to call 100 satoshi "bits"

True if there wasn't the open-source telegram protocol. I have to admit that I have not looked into the details of how to use their protocol, but I've heared it quite speeds uo the process of implementation. Plus the benefit would be to be able to chat with all telegram users, which is not that smal anymore in some regions.

in this case the rise is simewhat exponential therefor the logarithmic chart would be way better choice.
What a regualr person not following bitcoin would not be able to see in the chart is that we had already many times so called "bubbles" (meaning periods where price goes down. But in the end the rise that followed was always bigger!)

new transactions are coming a lot more during the week, so the mempool usually shrinks the weekend and often get cleared to 1 sat/byte level.


There is no fixed cost, not even a 2-5$ range without specifying "for a expected 1-3 hour confirmation" (or 1 day or 1 week).
These differ a LOT, thats why the chart of Jochen (see main link of the post) is so great, as you can see (event better if you filter by clicking on the left side sat/byte ranges) that some do high value transactions (in the 2-5$ range) all the time... but rather a minority. 
Some indicator, but hugely (!) misleading are fee-averages. Better are median, but not great either. Best is to look at Jochens chart... maybe we need to focus more on transaction costs for 1blocks/10 blocks/1 day/7 day expected confirmations (as mempool also tend to shrink when it's night in the US). Maybe a couple weighted averages (some that weight the 10 blocks heavier, some more the 1 or 7 day)

I never looked at the main page of bitcoinwisdom.io
And I don't care about altcoins much, but just looked at that page, and the cool thing is that they made a mix: you see satoshis, but also in grey you can see the 0.000s in front so also denomination in BTC... usefull for those that are closer to parity to BTC
nicely done in my opinion

Have you listened when he said that there are 2 alternative histories? Did overheared that, and stoped after the first one?
It is true AA does sometimes shorten some stories a bit, but thinking that he (or crypto) is the dark side, like you make it sound in some of you comments, is plain out wrong (and just too long to begin argumenting here). If AA sounds wrong to you... we have to agree to disagree... the other side is wrong*10k

I haven't looked through the entire video yet, but first error in the slides: blocksize limit of 1 mb (as stated in slide at minute 2)... at least not anymore.
I hope the rest has less errors... (this was line 1 of slide 1), especially as other facts/assumptions will obviously not be as easy to spot as that trivial one, at least not for those who take the video as learning material.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:51:06
what he understood wrong, it’s that people should not hodl for the well being of others, it’s good even for you being selfish, at least for all non pros out there, because timing the market is hard and many would end up with less! just read the original post on [bitcointalk]( where hodl comes from (the guy admitted, that he and average joe are bad traders, whales would outsmart us, even if it looks easy)! Note: if course you can choose to hodl 80% and try it out with the 20%... that’s the safe way to try
It is the same with other things like, have your own node. We have enough nodes right now, people should be motivated out of selfishness, it’s good for you (as it’s harder to trick you out of your money!!!). It´s a pitty that even the HTC exodus soon to come with a full node is being marketed by the project lead as doing good for the eco-system... no, it’s primarily to protect you! But yes, it is also good for the eco-system, as the more people use full nodes, the harder/impossible it is get for miners to do junk!
Of course it is always great if people would to things to help an eco-system, but this never scales to mass adoption. And this why it is important to understand that most things in bitcoin work because it is mainly in you self-interest (running a full node for private people, mining for miners, ...), even works if all behave very selfishly, it even works (most of the time) better that way!! All things are developed with this in mind! That’s the bitcoin trick!!

"running bitcoin" &lt;- not really definied what that mean.
If you just want a wallet: a light SPV Wallet won't need the entire blockchain.
But as you are posting here, you probably want to run a full node.
To run a full node, AT THE MOMENT you need to download the entire blockchain AND to keep it.
In future versions pruning will be implemented, and you'll be able to specifiy how much "history" / HDD-Space you want to keep
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:25:30
but your software should still verify the history (which is also time consuming)

just discovered another great piece from the never sleeping Pieter Wuille:
These are the features, that will let us run bitcoin when states will try to oppress it
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:30:55
it is not one buyer. They have many clients, they are just the custodian
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:01:30
I see your point, but would agree more, if bitcoin was a closed source eco-system. But it isn't... and Blockstream is the biggest contributor to Defensive Patents that helps protect that open system (


your mistake is saying "the" repository as if it was THE bitcoin repository. The moment crap gets merged, other will open a new repository and as long as they do a better job, it might become the client people use for bitcoin. So they don't have more influence than other companies, they just do 10 time more than other average companies (except Chaincode Labs probably) and BECAUSE of that you might conclude that they have more *influence*.
For now, they have proven to produce stable and secure software. They also work on long term stuff that very objectively benefits everyone (P. Wuille &amp; Co. -&gt; libsecp256k1, schnorr signatures, taproot, ...)
Some of those devs decided to found a company to better advance bitcoin (like Mozilla created a company to be stronger together and keep the internet open). Here a quote from an investor in Blockstream Brian Hoffmann (he talks mainly about sidechains, but also generally about moving bitcoin and its ecosystem forward):
"[...] And that’s why I’m participating in this first-round financing as an individual investor, and why Blockstream itself will function similarly to the Mozilla Corporation. Here, our first interest is maintaining and enhancing Bitcoin’s strong open ecosystem. And the structure we’ve chosen will give us the freedom and flexibility to prioritize public good over returns to investors." [...]

you see the amount of (signed) transactions that has been sent to the network, but only those transactions, that are not yet mined.
The colors represent the fee of the transactions (usually in satoshi per byte... knowing that an average transaction is about 300 byte, but depends mainly of number of in-/outputs)
And the sharp edges are the moment a block gets mined by a miner. The more transactions got into that block, the deeper we fall. When the jags/spikes are near each other, it means that more blocks got mined in a shorter period of time.
You can see the graph live here:
By the way... thanks for the very nice graphs!

What he meant is that because of Bitcoin to fiat conversion, there is a third-party that otherwise would not be needed in a non-fiat-crypto world/scenario.
Of course it is still very hard or impossible now to be non-fiat.
But I guess what people generally mean is that we can claim it to be great nees the day the hold the bitcoins to then spend them to pay their merchents (those that would be willing to accept Bitcoin), and thus creating a closed loop that would benefit all (just not/less the payment processors).

Edit: I love AA. He is a fabulous speaker. Of course I don't imply anything regarding him. I just want to understand what strange youtube feature is causing this (sounds a bug to me, but probably isn't... just a unknown quierk to me)
Can someone help me understand a small detail?
How is it possible, that for the video I see the published date as "1. Dec", but then I see comments that are multiple days old, even 1 week old.
If I refresh the video the view count increase at a very high percentage count, which tells me that video was probably published on 1st dec, but why old comments? 
Or video is older, but was updated with a better quality version maybe and the view count was reseted, but the comments stayed there??

Maybe because the state had the monopoly on coin minting, and therefore the powerful at the top choose to mint coin with less and less precious metals for their short personal profit, but leading ultimately to a global collapse (roman empire).
The problem was that it was much easier to enforce people to use your centralized minted coins, because all coins where physical and you could go into a home and for example confiscate true gold coins.
Before we had technologies like internet and bitcoin, it was not possible to move large amounts of money quickly without third parties. Bitcoin might in some way not just be limited in supply like gold, but has qualities  (near instanteanous trade without banks, less counterfeiting cause you can't fill the with tungsten, storing takes no physical space and therefore harder to confiscate for replacing it gradually with diluted gold ...) that gold does not have.
And bitcoin development is not finished (anonymity with darkwallet/coinjoin/coinshuffle, ...)
