What is the benefit of integrating with a platform such as Coinbase/Bitpay as opposed to rolling our own implementation?
For example, one big question we have is how challenging will it be to cash out to USD if we don't use a platform?

I completely agree with you about that. We should really have a fully functional mobile version. Thx for the feedback.

When we first launched, we started out by having the Standard Mattress Co. make a futon (cotton type) for us. This was a custom model they made for us. They also make futons models and various styles for many other brands (LLBean, West Elm, Gold Bond etc).
We were in a tough spot when we first got going because none of the suppliers would supply for two guys who they never heard of and who had no sales volume. Standard Mattress helped us get going with a unique model until we got on our feet a few months later.
This was also a good time for us to really learn a lot about how the mattress industry worked from the inside, begin collecting feedback, and to realise that our mission was so important to our customers.

We'll do a more in-depth writeup and open source the code. Thanks for the suggestion.

Thanks for the screenshot &amp; Github link. That's more inline with what we're looking for. I'll share this with the team.
Our goal is to make this as quick as entering a CC in a field without taking away the experience of a clean interface.
We're definitely open to rolling our own. We built our backend from scratch to work with a payment processor. I'd love to do the same with BTC; avoiding drop in plugins or widgets.

I'm glad to hear you're giving us a shot. Let us know if you have any questions via our contact form on the website (or phone).
Hopefully we'll have our BTC implementation complete in time.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:12:43
Thank you for the reference.
We've been looking at BitPay, but the issue we have with their process is the 3rd party redirect... Similar to how "Pay with Paypal" will redirect you to an offsite form.
Do you know of any services that can be integrated without that offsite redirect? Such as a Transparent Redirect.
Also, the BitPay API documentation is a .pdf which raises a flag (software developer here). Have you heard any feedback on integrating with their APIs? Coinbase appears to a better documented platform from what I've seen so far.

We're are currently working on that feature. It should be live by Monday.
Great minds think alike.

We designed our bed in house. We built over 130 prototypes for our v1 T&amp;N Bed and many more since then as we iterate on feedback. We're software engineers and designers so we take an engineering approach to the development of our products.
Our bed also isn't a futon. It's a foam mattress. 
As for transparency, we're 1 year old, founded by myself and Daehee Park. I'm based in Palo alto with a few other team members and the rest are in Tempe, AZ. Our manufacturing facility is just outside of LA where we make the beds from scratch, to order, and we do the fulfilment ourselves. We cut and sew our covers, cut and shape our foams, and put it all together.
We do have suppliers such as the foam that is poured daily, knitted fabrics, threads and other various materials. The foam mixtures and the fabrics are of our design but we're too small yet to afford the machines to make that ourselves.
Please let me know if you have any other questions. We're also open to meeting in person if you're in the bay area. We love talking about the things we're working on and how we can make a better bed / sleep experience.

I totally understand the pain of moving mattresses around.
Our current model is 5" thick and folds in half for transport. It was designed to be versatile and easy to move. Also, if it's left in the box, you could just carry it up and unbox it in the room.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:48:33
We don't manufacture a frame yet but it's something we'd really like to do. We have to grow a bit more.
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:18:41
I'm glad to hear that. Bitcoin is definitely a direction we want to move for our payment system. We're always looking for ways to make our processes more streamlined and in sync with important developments.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:14:40
This is definitely a valid point.
When we first got started, we didn't imagine that setting prices would be as difficult as it was. We had to balance margins (to keep us alive and growing) with numbers that our customers and prospective customers approved of.
Regarding the X99 vs Y00, it is definitely common practice in retail to end numbers with 99 because research supports, in some cases, that more customers will make a purchase. That isn't the reason we chose those numbers though. We had conducted a survey that sampled 3 groups (past customers, prospective customers, and a control) asking whether they would prefer 199 vs 200. The conclusion was that X99 was preferred by a landslide. The reasoning seemed to vary but one of them that mattered a lot to us was that it was considered to be a more familiar number (Y00 was considered weird).
We're a very pragmatic and feedback driven company and we like to question our approach regularly. That is how we ended up at the X99 and very well may end up iterating on it again in the future.
Whenever we make product, service, team changes, or marketing decisions, we have a list of criteria we follow to be sure that we are sticking to our core values and moving in the direction we set out for when we launched. Criteria like: Is this what we would want? Is this fair?
It may also be worth mentioning that we give all our customers 30 day trial. We allow them to make returns for a full refund. We also cover all costs incurred with our return process as well. This is a safety net we put in place for our customers who don't find our products or services as a perfect fit but it can also be used by someone experiencing buyers remorse or for whatever reason.
I hope that brings some clarity around our pricing. Let me know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:26:53
Unfortunately we don't. 
We have had some customers facilitate the shipping to Europe themselves but I wouldn't recommend that. The feel of a bed is definitely subjective and we'd want to have something in place over there to help you possibly return it if it wasn't a good fit.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:28:55
This is something we're still trying to figure out. We currently refund the current exchange rate of BTC rather than the original value.
There is definitely some risk at both ends. On our side, if we had a surge of orders when BTC is at a low value and then all of those customers request a refund a month later because the value doubled or tripled, we'd have to pack our boxes and shut down. We would have essentially become a secured buyer for them to cash out.
What are your thoughts on this topic? We want to be sure that our policies are friendly but fair. A new alternative currency definitely needs to be complemented by innovations in retail policies and our community will figure these things out in due time.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:58:45
Will do.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:44:07
Generally we can confirm cc transactions within a second. The time that the funds become available and can be transferred is variable.
Our payment processor (Stripe) releases funds to us on a 7 day interval.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:23:11
Completely agree. That's why we started the company last year. We're working our tails off to cause some change.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:14:29
Approaching our suppliers to see if they're open to accepting BTC payment is a great idea. Many of them are old school so we'll have to really sell them on the benefits they would have.
We should definitely plan on offering it as a compensation option for employees.
I really appreciate feedback.

What's the name of your WP plugin?
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:00:28
That's a really great point. I'll be sure to discuss this with the team.
The frame pictured is of our design but isn't available yet. We're still a pretty new startup and have to do some more growing before we can manufacture hard goods.
West Elm has some minimal and well designed options.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:38:37
Really appreciate that. I'll be sure to share with the team.
