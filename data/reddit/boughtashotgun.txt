nope. That was just some whale selling 7-8k BTC. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:53:44
It was on my BTCE account. Not sure of what it is. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 07:51:40
I am retired. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:47:12
he lives about 200 miles away. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:22:47
Mind helping me find it? I don't have access to the BTCE account any more. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:29:46
I suppose I owe him a call. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:15:43
I'm sixty eight, there really isn't much else going on in life. 
Any other ideas for charities? Weighing options.

They were on an offline wallet. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:36:33
I a very old man. I do not want to go on. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:46:58
more my loss of faith in humanity. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:19:00
I have a son, wife is gone now. He never calls me. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:23:51
This is pretty stereo typical, but I honestly do not believe my kid cares. He has his own family, his own kids, his own life. He never even calls me. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:13:03
I am going to kill myself. I might live stream it. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 07:05:56
I am going to donate the BTC to charity, probably. Or the guy who needs to pay medical bills. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:21:34
Honestly it's not about the money. I'm just tired of living. Now that my retirement funds are gone, I'm just tired of living. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:17:43
They were on my BTC-E account. The other couple were just on a flash drive. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:05:21
Bye everyone. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 07:49:57
Give me your BTC address and I will send the four coins no questions asked. If you do, I will send the coins but kill myself. If you don't, I will go on a trip to visit my son. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:37:21
Give me a call for me. Tell him how much you love him. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:16:27
why? 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:12:24
Link? 
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:46:16
I hit some lsd in the 80s but I mine as well try it again.
