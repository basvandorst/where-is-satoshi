Looking at it objectively, it's apples and oranges. Any comparison of a cryptocurrency to a search engine is limited in its usefulness.

So it's a poor comparison.

No, but you ran with it by comparing bitcoin to AltaVista... All analogies are limited (I have not suggested otherwise).

Indeed, the potential implications are profound, but it may not have to be a case of fiat vs crypto. A symbiosis of sorts is possible, but right now its early days, growing pains. If it's in national interest to embrace cryptocurrencies then nations will do so.

I very much doubt it will come to that. My comment about the internet is simply that regardless of what is considered legal tender, cryptocurrencies can still have value (as they currently do, whether or not they have legal tender status).

Or it may be seen as an opportunity, rather than a threat, and regulation can help to bring stability (the current volatility in the cryptocurrency space being an example of where stability could be beneficial).

It's for these reasons I think there will be increasing regulation, but as noted above, that may not be a bad thing if it benefits the majority of people who aren't seeking to use bitcoin (etc.) for nefarious purposes. Also, given the decentralized nature of the blockchain, that regulation may well continue to come from within, and be consensus driven (rather than being imposed by oligarchs).

Fear, greed... Nothing new in that, but we no longer have to place our trust in a third party. That's huge. Thanks, Satoshi, where ever you are...

Funny, but I wasn't suggesting that Bitcoin is like a natural disaster; I was using natural disasters as an example of how drastic things can happen in a relatively short time frame. Although, ironically, natural disasters can lead to evolutionary progression, and I do consider cryptocurrencies in those terms (at least partially precipitated by the 'natural disaster' of the 2008/2009 recession).

And so anyone holding bitcoin at that time, if they don't transfer to the new currency, lose all they have? Or rather perhaps the existing currencies will simply adopt the new tech, with the biggest players remaining so, because of name recognition etc. If one compares (for analogy) Google to Bitcoin, as average internet speed has increased, and there have been developments in the software the powers the web, that has simply been used.

I presume you're alluding to an anarchic manifesto, and I'm aware of that notion (in so far as its been presented to us by the media), but I would guess that the majority of people who currently own any cryptocurrency don't really understand what it represents and are not driven by ideological motivation. I imagine that many of these support the currency simply because they see it as a way to increase their financial wealth (a reason that certainly aligns with national interest); whereas those behind the development of the currencies are now a tiny fraction in relation to the several million (and counting) people who own some.

First they'd have to shut down the internet. Good luck with that... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:00:12
I don't think so. Drastic things can happen in a split second (consider natural disasters), and in terms of drastic human created changes, consider what happened in less than 10 years after we split the atom.

AltaVista never had a market cap of several hundred billion dollars...
