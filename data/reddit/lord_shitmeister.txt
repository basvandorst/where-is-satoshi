Well that's the whole reason we have servers I mean... because nobody wants the whole dump of commercial transaction hitting a home network. Isn't this a cripling weakness ? Can we do a crypto without nodes or with distributed nodes ?
I mean the nodes should get paid, then they would be able to scale up. But running a full node is free right ? So the incentives are fucked up aren't they ? Pushing them to go offchain to solve the problem and GET PAID for it ? Or am I missing something ?
TIL Bitcoin full nodes are expensive to run and don't reward the people that run them enough to make it economical.  YES/NO?
 * Nevermind, I understand better now, the scale up of the nodes would have to be enourmous, beyond anything technically feasible. I didn't realize the blockchain and block rates of increase were so asymetrical.

Wow, the math convinced me thanks. I didn't realize the rates of increase were asymetrical between blocksize and blockchain. I guess in this case my idea of just paying the nodes to scale up isn't feasible.

Honest question (not a statement masquerading as a question): Isn't LN a way to get money away from the minners and into the hands of private companies ? Why can't the block size be simply increased to say 10 mb ?

Well they might be :)

Well thanks for taking the time ! It was a good exchange I learned  alot.

I didn't realize the scale problam was that bad 1/1000 of the capacity we need per block. I guess if it's that bad yes an offchain solution makes sense. 
Is this problem going to cripple any crypto that has widespread adoption ? Is there no way to make on chain solutions afordable for large scale use ?

And that's super great, can you image the video games we could have, DOTA + money = total addiction :) 
But that doesn't explain WHY it's not possible to do this on chain.

Well they might be :)

Yeah but I mean isnt there a fee to using that LN or are they runing this non profit ? Because the whole idea of crypto is to have an arraw of incentives instead of trust (Paraphrasing from that Andreas guy). Also, aren't hard drives cheaper than a whole new solution ?

If you're poor you can cheat and if you're rich you shouldn't care or do it yourself (filling).

So long as people have a philosophy of "if it goes to zero it's ok too" bitcoin won't be worth a damn. You know why the dollar (that shit scamcoin without a blockchain) is worth something ?
Because people will fight with their fucking lives to defend it. Because we all know it's not alright if it goes to zero, its the end of days and we won't let it happen.
So long as people don't view bitcoin like THAT then it's just speculation, not currency.

You can't always control it, like on localbitcoin the site wallet has 0.002 in fees. On Ethereum there's a site that tells you how much you can spend to get x amount of minutes... is there such a think on bitcoin ?
