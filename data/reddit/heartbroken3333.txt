It works. I wish more people knew how it works.

That's called bouncing off a 200 EMA on the 4hr chart.  
This is the third time it's bounced off the 200 EMA in the past few days, meaning, the more time it keeps hitting it, the more likely it'll break to the downside.  
Need to close and stay above the 50 EMA on 4hr otherwise we'll most likely come back and test the 200 EMA again.  
If that fails, we're heading back down real quick to 7.2k to 7kish.  
Side note, that was my crystal ball.

If people actually read the user agreement before creating the account, they would know that it says they will retain information for 6 months unless notice was given to them to delete the info.

"$10 is a good deal, so $8.5K is an even better deal"  
I'm assuming you forgot to add the K at the end of $10 in your title but if you didn't, then 20k is a rocket deal.

Remember, your mom or grandma buying bitcoin isn't an indicator that it's bullish.   
It just means that they're more open and understanding of it.

I'll wait until the extreme fear hits 0-1.

Why don't you state your fees and be transparent about it?  
Is it gonna take an allegation and 20 comments going back and fourth to finally state your ridiculous fees?  
State your fee and the spread % that your using to exchange, otherwise you'll get more allegations and you'll be categorized as the 13%+ fee extortionist.  
Who's paying me? Where did you come up with that?  
I'll repeat the message again because it seems like you haven't gotten the message.  
You do realize your part of the problem by setting insane high fees just because everyone else is?  
Don't create a barrier for new people and don't give a reason for veterans not to use your machine.

Keep the fees low and others around your area will start lowering their fees once they notice a competition.  
You see the other alternative that you mentioned? That the alternative is to pay 10%?  
We want to eliminate those barriers and ridiculous fees and make sure that fees are kept low so that the new standard to charge fees are low.  
The 13% is the average rate that most people charge when they first get into this business, whether it's 10%, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, it's still high and since you weren't transparent to begin with, I threw a non-factual allegation at you to see what kind of response I'll get.  
If you really are charging 4-6%, don't be afraid about it. Be transparent. You'll see people flocking to your machine with that rate. You should advertise your rates openly.  
In a few years, 4-6% will be considered average and that's where we want to get it at.

So your one of those who charges 13%+ fee.  
You do realize your part of the problem by setting insane high fees just because everyone else is?  
Don't create a barrier for new people and don't give a reason for veterans not to use your machine.    
You'll get higher volume with lower fees.  
I own 6 machine and I've been in the game for 4 years and went through this exact phase, charging a ridiculous fee just because we could and everyone else was doing it.  
Later I decided to experiment with lowering my fees and 6 months later, I've been getting more volume than I ever had and it was consistence.  
All my machines are 4.5%, one of the best rates you'll ever see and you only need to attach a phone number which you can user a burner app for.
