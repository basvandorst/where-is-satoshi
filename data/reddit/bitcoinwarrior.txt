its when a big ugly bear walks up behind you, pulls your pants down and gives it to you good and hard for a long long time.

6% apr. Predatory! Don't be silly. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:24:03
120mb! ridiculous for such a basic programme.  i dont trust it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:24:19
malware, hacks, computer blows up
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:39:17
as soon as you decide you don't really fancy losing your coins
@_date: 2013-05-19 21:40:42
6 conf requirements on transactions is a problem. no?
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:46:54
why is there the 4k limit?
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:33:34
can you add  to the wallet section please.

@_date: 2013-04-10 10:42:13
blockchain is 
not too sure. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 14:13:34
very lol
@_date: 2013-05-19 21:54:43
Appreciate your response. Cheers 
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:43:00
you're missing the point!
people won't go through that whole charade just to use bitcoin.
its too much work. just not worth it.
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:06:45
@_date: 2013-03-25 10:11:13
thats my point.
the official bitcoin sites are terrible. badly designed and badly explained.
newbies have no authoritative destination for their understandable myriad questions
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:43:14
our job is to make things easier. otherwise bitcoin dies
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:22:58
a full blown escrow process for a small transaction seems a little overkill
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:16:32
Terrible programme. Bad interviewees. Amateur hour. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 21:41:34
could you please explain why it isnt a good idea
@_date: 2013-03-01 09:39:31
It wouldn't matter if we generated the same number sequentially because the initial cards are then shuffled using the Bitcoin transaction id as the Mersenne Twister 'seed'.
It's not vulnerable to card counting because it doesn't use a real deck as such.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:41:13
1:1 is doubling your stake. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:52:42
too good!
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:06:17
i know, thats my point!
what if you could buy BTC with traditional payment methods without their obvious failings
@_date: 2013-03-01 09:37:28
That's the way it works - one deposit per hand.
It cant shuffle them to benefit the house because the 'seed' was generated by Bitcoin so how can we manipulate the outcome of the cards?
We could manipulate the initial cards which get shuffled, but we give you a hash so you can verify we haven't changed them.
@_date: 2013-02-27 15:44:15
The game uses Python random.radint function and doesn't run any client side logic. We've looked into provably fair gaming and we're trying to decide on implementation.

@_date: 2013-04-09 19:54:36
Btc should stand for bitcent. End of problem. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:47:58
hard to argue with.
hyper deflation is a big problem
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:41
i don't want a AMA. I want him talking straight into the camera
@_date: 2013-02-28 21:33:21
That's not true because the server seed is always unique.
In order to find the final shuffle of the cards you would need to shuffle them, using the client seed, in the order that we initially dealt them.
You can't determine the order they were initially dealt from the hash, but you can verify it afterwards.
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:04:12
what would the app do?
simple bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:12:27
take a look
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:41:56
fair point. 
not getting off until the price is ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:08:21
For BTC to be considered a global transaction currency - it has effectively hit the jackpot.
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:09:29
who gets to define 'abuse'
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:01:28
great post. well played.
@_date: 2013-02-28 11:43:37
new high frenzy implies we can't believe its worth that much and thus overvalued and thus potentially a bubble.
we should celebrate mainstream companies embracing bitcoin more than bitcoin spot prices
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:01:08
dont call me a cunt mate.
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:25:14
lol. nice one
@_date: 2013-02-27 15:18:51
Can you please explain what you mean?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:09
for not keeping us informed. for not dealing respectfully with his customers. for overseeing what is clearly a huge clusterfuck
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:55:39
too funny.
@_date: 2013-03-04 13:29:43
how could you make them expire?

1:1 is doubling your stake 
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:07:45
decentralised/distributed nature of blockchain is hugely exciting.
would love to riff with people about how else to leverage it
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:46:47
edit - no single gatekeeper.
 - almost free
 - almost instant
@_date: 2013-03-01 09:29:53
It's perfectly possible for a 9 to appear after an 8. Thats the reason for provably fair gaming, you can verify we didn't place the 9 after the 8 - it was a random shuffle!
@_date: 2013-02-28 19:26:42
bitzino might get popular with people who make typos trying to reach bitino.com
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:48:15
not true. 
ceteris paribus fiat is better for you as you get protection, via chargebacks etc.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:43:25
yeah baby.
just gotta find somewhere to buy from...
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:56:43
i think you may have missed the sarcasm of my post
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:18:17
can you elaborate pls
@_date: 2013-03-06 12:27:55
that one doesnt fill me with much confidence.
@_date: 2013-03-01 09:30:17
Yeah some people are having issues with the animation, we're going to disable it for the moment.
@_date: 2013-06-17 10:33:45
kinda cool but not close to fixing the damage they've caused the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2013-04-25 08:14:50
you didn't have to go through a 15 step process involving booting up OS's etc to get on the internet.
