It's clear that you don't have a deep background of crypto. This is only a ~20% decrease bitcoin has seen worse 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:31
yeah that's true I didn't think of that 
All we can do is hope
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:17
We're down 10% in the last hour and 18% in the last day 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:39
While it might not reach 20k anytime soon you should be fine
Don't bash yourself for this - it's impossible to pinpoint the lowest dips

$7.51 to send $218! is pretty cheap in my opinion

Bro stop being so toxic we get it, bitcoin's the best crypto. When was that ever disputed? Gatekeeping on these subs will get you no where, just keep your mouth shut like the other veterans

its pretty clear that he was making fun of his sentence structure
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:22:51
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:23:09
no it isn't clear that you understood that, which is why you have your downvotes
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:32:06
heh I was having fun replying to him anyways
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:00:22
there's no way you aren't trolling lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:54:30
lmao I'm mentally limited?
There's a reason why you have negative karma you fucking troll

u/kencole54321 was teasing him about how his sentences are spaced out. Then you come in and say "are you fucking stupid?" A normal person would think that you did not comprehend what he was stating, so I went ahead and explained it.
Then you respond with "of course I understood that it was obvious in my writing" Yet again, a normal person would not think that. 
Now you say that the reason why you have downvotes is because you think you are on a "heightened intelligence" than the average person, and assume that u/kencole54321, an "average person", feels like he is above someone. In reality, you think that you are above him, simply because you thought that his statement was unironic.
Finally, you state that I'm "mentally retarded" because I left out a period - on a social media website. 
It's clear that Reddit isn't the place for you if you can't decipher this basic form of irony you fucking egotistic kid
Edit: I'm screenshotting this so the world can see your stupidity
