What’s the great firewall?

Right?? We’re nowhere near 13,000

Agree.  Wait for streets covered with blood and the screams of children and old ladies from burning buildings.
That’s when you buy.

Correction?  BTC is down 70% from it’s ATH.  In your mind, what’s the difference between a correction and a crash?  The housing market declined by less than 70% in 2007, and that was considered a crash.

This pump feels extremely abrupt and hollow to me. I don’t necessarily doubt the reasons given in the article, but I do think that in order for this to signal a true reversal, we should be getting more signs that the fundamentals have changed.  There’s been no new news re groundbreaking partnerships, government “support”,  or tech developments.  No sign that new buyers are FOMO’ing into the market. We haven’t even hit the kind of scary bottom that would signal capitulation.
Call me crazy, but this seems like a bull trap set by whales, or even the bigger players (Soros and Rockefeller) who “announced” they were entering the market but probably did so months ago...

Most respected TAs are seeing 3100 as the bottom. Foolish to buy now.  Think we’re going back to pre-mania prices, which only makes sense.  The mania is over, new money is scared to death to touch BTC and isn’t coming in. This coin has to be near death before it will revive for the next bull run. The good news is that it shouldn’t take years for this to happen.  Timeframes are compressing.  We could bottom out by June.
