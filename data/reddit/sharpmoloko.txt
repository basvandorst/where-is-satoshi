Bitcoin back to its roots. I like it.

That’s actually decent

It’s not fraud until BTC is an SEC approved ETF. Bitcoin is supposed to be free of gov’t regulation.

I’m all for further btc support but fuck Jack Dorsey.

I’m just not a fan of censorship, especially enforced by the rich and powerful.

I swear some people don’t know about miner fees.

I refuse to believe people make any money in these fake markets. Clearly inside trading that would make you pull your hair out at 5 am over.
Edit: you can keep downvoting me if it softens the blow of your financial losses lol
Edit2: Just wanted to say if you like what you see check out r/dogfck and r/thisgotmebanned. I’d say check out our lord and savior, u/dogfck or the holyland, r/downvotetrolling, but they’re both banned atm :( happy trails brothers.

I’ll never know if you can smell fresh tar and old newports on your cracked iPhone  screen, but I’m pretty sure I’m on Reddit dot com and not walking my ass out in public on the sidewalk.
Still on a fancy Internet forum where I don’t have to talk to you irl and you best believe I still do not care lol. 
Enjoy the sun out today. Summers around the corner. Don’t break your leg running after those goddamn ice cream trucks.

I got laid last night and I really don’t care if you believe me. Internet words don’t hurt. I’m drinking coffee coming down from a lot of acid and rn I’ve got nothing better to do than to talk to sweaty mfs on reddit. 
Wish I could get off this app, but the state of this site rn is like if 4chan users were let loose on unsuspecting instagram users and they have literally no clue what’s going on. I mean nothing’s going on in that noggin but sheer panic.
I upvoted you. Hope your day goes well. None of these numbers matter :)

Finally someone with their head screwed on with a 4 digit SAT score!
You best believe I’ve never done what’s considered a high dose in my life. I don’t even do a moderate dose more frequently than once ever 3 months.
Not something I’d like to be too deeply associated with for obvious reasons but let me tell you some of the guys on r/dxm are straight shamans that make my ramblings sound like a proper Sunday dinner conversation piece.
As far as why these people choose to treat bitcoin like an ETF, I really don’t want to find the reason. I don’t feel like it’ll be a good one, most likely to make them feel like ‘real market traders’. 
The currency has proven to have an undeniable utility. Just leave it at that. Leave your self righteous greed out of the equation. It’s not a clean sight for the eyes.

Not sure if you noticed, but I didn’t call any group of people “losers”. Name-calling really isn’t my thing, makes me feel like I need a shower. It reminds me of junior high school bullies whose dicks were the size of those expired caramels my grandma used to give me before she passed away. 
I don’t really get kicks from berating people. I’m just saying there’s clearly some dangerously risky manipulation involved in crypto day-trading (or even long term for that matter) that makes markets dizzyingly volatile. 
I believe in bitcoin and I believe in people learning from their mistakes and becoming better with age. I hope the currency helps out those who need to use it. Personally, I don’t think it’s a feasible “investment”. Just my 2 cents. Take em and ride the Walmart pony or leave me alone.

Oh contrary! I use btc as a currency. But I’d be a fool to believe crypto exchanges aren’t manipulated in an incredibly skewed and broken manner. Any ‘trader’ on these markets are undoubtedly being feed stats and prices manufactured by a select group of people. The numbers don’t lie. This market is incredibly unnatural. I don’t really care if you deny it.

I’m sorry you feel that way. I didn’t know liking video games and drugs discounted what I say but that’s ok. 
As long as I can still enjoy a mainstream game, I still will. Idc what other people think, I’m enjoying myself.
I know plenty of people (myself included) that consider a well prepared dxm dose one of their favorite drug experiences of choice for special occasions, sometimes even preferred over classical psychedelics even though recreational use is mostly underground and frowned upon it really is a proper dissociative drug that will teach you a lesson. 
I understand your contempt for drug users. No doubt someone told you growing up to look down on these people no matter who they were. I know personally someone told me that when I was impressionable.  The facts are people are people and the sooner we learn to just appreciate the good we’re doing as a collective instead of haphazardly splicing out the bad parts and play them on instant replay on the big screen over and over, maybe this world wouldn’t be such a cold malicious place.
But hey let’s resort to juvenile name-calling like back on the playground. That always worked out, right?

I’m gonna fucking die laughing, you animal.

There won’t be another rally. These types of posts are really cringey. Switch to monero and actually use crypto as currency.

How did you get crypto on ToS?

Politicians don’t give a fuck if you trust them or not. Just vote for the familiar name and let them ride the system for all it’s worth.
