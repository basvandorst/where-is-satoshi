I get the reasoning behind your comment (I upvoted), but in this singular instance if Finex goes away for good I do see it as a good thing. Finex has been a drag on the BTC market for the last two years holding back rallies and causing major down swings to last longer with their "the platform doesn't work when you need it to" system. I'm perfectly fine with consolidation and getting the incompetent players out of the market as long as they are replaced by superior alternatives (faster, decentralized exchanges). 
But, your point is well taken. :)

 - that's the link to the latest discussion on SegWit implementation into Core's wallet. It's the first topic discussion and basically amounts to there are still bug issues that need addressing which can be followed here -

Interesting stuff, I somehow hadn't seen this before. Is there more discussion / back-and-forth that discussed the merits of this proposal?

Upvoted. I've seen a bunch of people attribute the current rise to India and the 30-day volume of the two largest Indian exchanges + LBC are a drop in the bucket. Unocoin, Coinsecure and LBC were around ~3k-4k coins for 2nd week Nov - Dec 20th combined I believe so saying India is driving the last part of this rally seems misleading. 
China (duh), Segwit release removing some market uncertainty (and while adoption remains lowish, the 10/27 release stopped the sideways trading since halving had occurred), global market factors and finally, this latest bit, speculation seems to be the driving forces behind this wave. Yes, India adoption helps and forward thinking investors can see the potential, but India still lags in many infrastructure areas that prevent their influence skyrocketing in the short term.

Exactly what I was looking for thank you. I figured there had to have been a more balanced discussion somewhere, but somehow I completely missed it. Much appreciated.

Have to give you credit - one of the more creative ways I have seen to spam an affiliate link.

Upvoted. Pretty incredible that people are some how forgetting that this document was prepared over 3 years ago by Goldman Sachs -
