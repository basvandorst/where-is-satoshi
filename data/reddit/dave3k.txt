Just curious, Why the downvotes for my comment?

"52 percent of respondents cited security concerns as their barrier to entering the bitcoin realm."
This is going to be bitcoins biggest barrier to entry imho.

I've listed my iPhone 5 for sale (switched to android) on eBay with a discount if bought in bitcoin.  
I save on exchange fees and paypal, they save on purchase. 
Not sure if eBay will pull it though :P

Good news, thanks.

Upload a high quality scan to proofofexistence.com, the hash will be embedded in the block chain to prove it existed on this date.
One of many uses of the blockchain :)

In short, It is possible to spend with low/no fees but it depends upon multiple thing such as age of coins and coin sizes.

I think a lot of us (me included at times) are forgetting that some people are very new to this, they may not really understand Gox's past.
It all good saying that everyone knew the risks involved with them, however some people just got in to bitcoin and saw gox as a big exchange thats been around for a while and went for it.
Of Course everyone should do their homework before investing, but saying "I told you so" will not help.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:15:05
Might do that, thanks. Will probably order a cd just incase

Centralized, data collecting, fiat backed offline p2p payments.. Not so attractive to me, could scare square and co.

purse.io alows you to pay for somones amazon order and recive bitcoin in exchange.
 
Will that work?

I will be sending people here in future.
Makes bitcoin seem much less daunting.

I don't get it.

Also, when you do set a second password, Remember that your prior backups are not affected, therefore it is advisable to replace/destroy them.

Browser extension? Might have 'caught' the wallet when it was unencrypted on your end.
If mac, could be cointhief trojan.

@_date: 2014-02-26 21:31:47
I don't think they would have to log in, it would swipe the wallet from your browser not via blockchain.info... this happened to me.
Check for pop up blocker under your running extensions (note it does not show up in the extensions tab in chrome only 'tools-task manager')

Warning! I have dug in to the trojan a little (not really my thing but its cost me so i thought I would have a go)  
One key thing I noticed that does not seem to be reported: It can mask addresses with his own address, so you go to for example
localbitcoins.com then instead of showing you the address to deposit to, it is actually showing his own!
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:11:25
sorry, Misinformation. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:13:48
yeah, its not just localbicions.com that was just an example,
This is a bit of the code so you can see what it is capable of:

I was just playing around with making an app to do just this, 
My number 1 issue to over come was to get enough people using it to be worth while, these guy should not have this problem.
Although slightly annoying to happen just as I was developing it, Its good to know its from them.
One other feature I was working on was 'auto trade'. If nobody was active near by, it could keep your trades active and track your gps then alert users when they get in range of relevant trades.
edit: my app in pre-alpha:

Just make sure you are responsible with it (buy beer!)
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:43:25
Probably not that then, do you have a firewall?
I'm sure you are careful with downloads, it did seem to point to malware though (guessing by the blockchain you are not alone). 
Phone linked?  
 Sorry for your loss btw.

Well that explains my empty wallet!
 Time to reformat and setup from scratch I guess

Not too used to trying to use bitcoin on iphone but there should be apps to check balance from public key...
  if not...  
Scan public qr code with any qr reader app then use bitref.com
@_date: 2015-08-29 19:15:17
Why are you scanning the private key as opposed to the corresponding public key?  Am I misunderstanding?
Basically, yes, it is about as exposed as if you were importing. 
*Edit:forgot how to words*
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:26:32
Think I might play around with your expiration date idea. atm I keep no keys however there is no reason to trust me.
They are 3 layered, key is thermal gloss paper (i have tested in on radiator etc) therefore water proof, then void layer with inkjet qr/face, then a extra strong transparent layer. would like to inkjet, once I have everything else worked out.
Would not like to invest in inkjet if someone finds some major flaw in another part of my design!

I popped in there for a couple of pints last week, I was very impressed by the till system.
What really got me was after I payed in bitcoin, another customer payed buy card and it took much more effort and time! 
(Type till price in reader, wait for reader to be ready, insert card, enter pin, wait for dial up, print receipts, confirm on till....)
Also I was told that it was much simpler adding up tills at close, (bitcoin auto exchanged and totaled).
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:21:20
Just be careful that we don't have a situation where we a falsely representing the value,
I.e, if price is going up report all you want,
If price is dropping don't report.
Remember that some people are new to this and struggle to get a balanced view, then they come here to see only the good news, but when there is bad news it is all hidden.
I'm not saying don't mod, just be careful.

I might go against others on this, but I do believe that if you have made a profit, it is a good idea to realize some in fiat or gold or pizza etc (mabee not the best time).
I have sold a small amount (~10%) and now know that i am in profit no matter what happens.*
I am long term bullish however I did regret not selling anything in april for quite some time.
If bitcoin does go to the moon, 90% will still be nice.
*not including full fiat melt down/pizza not appreciating over time. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:04:11
I have done the same..
If you can get hold off these casascius blank coins, you can print and load them yourself.  
As an idea, this is how i did mine: 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:17:48
I have to say, these look great, if laser printed, they last well, also you could laminate ar store in a zip pouch.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:08:56
Thanks for the feedback, Instead of selling I was thinking more gifting i.e tips or just to friends, not for sale.
I like the idea of shared encryption however for coins around the value of a coffee, I am not sure.
