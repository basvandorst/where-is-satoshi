How would people feel about automatically adding a tax fee to every crypto transaction?  Then you don't have to worry about filling taxes and IRS about collecting them.  Would this work? ��

He’s one of those who would take $1 over a Bitcoin, isn’t he? ��

�� He is such an idiot ��

He looks like Vitalik Buterin ��

Can you wait to pay your taxes until 2019?  Say you don't want to sell your bitcoin just yet to cover your tax payment.  Can you file an amended return in 2019 for 2017 taxes?

Is there any other way to buy besides through an exchange?

It strangely ends when Bakkt is supposed to launch (September 23rd).  I hope this is good timing. ��

Though as far as I can tell, Coinbase was the only one that actually got sued by the IRS. I feel like my account is more closely being monitored there.

I saw a tested.com video of them trying to purchase a bitcoin.  I was interested in buying one too. Until they recommended not to on their podcast.  I regret not buying several. ��

And those short squeezes causing even more short squeezes. It's a domino effect.

Wait so what's the difference between money and currency? ��

I'd rather not rub it in their face the fact that they sold too early.

He's actually right though in saying that certain cryptocurrencies will collapse.  There's way too many of them for all to be successful.  Like the dot Com boom, only a certain number of them will thrive.  I think it's relatively safe to assume bitcoin will be one of them.

I like the cash app.  It's pretty easy to buy Bitcoin.  I haven't used Coinbase since they treated my withdrawals as "sales" and I'm scared they report that to the IRS.

$1000. I was late to the party apparently based on these comments ��
