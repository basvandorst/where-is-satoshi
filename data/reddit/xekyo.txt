Actually, the Merkle root is not derived from concatenating the transaction ids, but from creating a Merkle tree from them. The tree format is important as otherwise you wouldn't have Merkle branches which provide a condensed way of proving the inclusion of a transaction in a block.

To the network, lost coins are indistinguishable from coins in long-term storage. So, there is no handling done at all.

The Merkle root is part of the block header, so if someone were to provide an incorrect Merkle root, they would also have to provide a different block header, as the hash of the block header is easy to verify.
However, to provide another block header whose hash also adheres to the required difficulty, they have mine a fake block, so what you propose is in the simple form very easy to protect against or expensive to pull-off in the convincing version. The simple form you can beat by checking the block hash for the difficulty, and checking whether the block hash derives from the provided block header.
Then, the transaction can be proven to be contained in the block by providing the Merkle branch (i.e. the transaction id, the hashing partners of the transaction and the Merkle root).
Chiefly, (unless provided a fake block) SPV wallets can be lied about a transaction not being in the block, they cannot be made to believe in an incorrect transaction.
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:40:29
The Merkle root is a hash digest of the txids of all transactions in a block. Txids (Transaction IDs) themselves are a hash digest of the transaction they identify.
The Merkle root allows to prove that a transaction was included in a block, and therefore makes it sufficient to only include the Merkle root in the block header to define the transaction body of the block.  
This does not reduce blocksize or the blockchain, but instead it allows:
* Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), where you can prove that a transaction was in a block by providing it's Merkle branch
* Allows mining schemes where pool contributors create their own blocks
* Allows the pruning mode of Bitcoin Core
You can find an encompassing explanation of Merkle trees here: [What is the Merkle root?](

Is this your perception or have you actually checked the historical data?  
Because [some math I did a while ago on block interval expectations]( suggests that about every 20th block should have an interval of more than 30 minutes and every four hundredth block interval should be more than an hour. So, we'd expect approximately seven block intervals longer than 30 minutes per day. And one longer than an hour a bit more frequently than about every third day.
Also, how do you know that the mining power is fluctuating strongly?
@_date: 2016-08-13 22:32:16


You'd think that. But did you actually talk to people working for Blockstream and asked them about it? Do you realize that everything they produce which you think is supposed to make them rich is opensource and therefore difficult to monetize? Also, most of them probably already have a sufficient amount of Bitcoin not to be particularly worried about getting rich?
What seems much more likely is that some people stopped to use the blockchain as a ledger for their internal transactions. Such as Companies like BitFinex that realize it's retarded to keep every customer's balance in a separate hotwallet and balance them out every thirty minutes. On the blockchain.
Try looking at the seven day average of that chart and you'll see that transactions have not significantly dropped from what you described as "peak". Actually rose further, just peaks were flatter. Also, Ethereum doesn't have transaction levels to account for all the people that supposedly switched over.
Price pressure leads to more efficient usage of blockspace. It's working. Anything else?

Strictly speaking, mining is easily misunderstood when described as "solving complex mathematical problems". The problem is more akin to playing the lottery: Only one in a large number of tickets wins, thus requiring a certain number of tickets to be bought in average until a winner is found. As it can be proven that the effort was expended, the thus winning block becomes hard to replace.

Actually, one could argue that the RBF- flag reduces the risk of double spends. RBF transactions are non-standard, and clearly indicate themselves as "non-final", i.e. they are *explicitly* telling the recipient not to count on them before they are confirmed. Once they are included in a block, they are just as final as any other transaction.
By comparison, other unconfirmed transactions just in general aren't final, and don't explicitly warn about that. ;)

@_date: 2016-04-23 23:08:15
Calling Lightning a Proof-of-Stake system is orthogonal to the concept usually labeled as PoS. Him having done so will just generate loads of confusion.
What we usually describe as PoS is a mechanism to achieve distributed consensus among a network of participants. Staking there is providing updates to the whole network's state, where you earn fees for contributing to the validity and the security of the network.
On the other hand, Lightning Network is a system of bilateral smartcontracts, where you may earn a fee by providing liquidity to other users. Nodes along a payment path don't provide any proof whatsoever, they merely forward a payment. There is no global consensus in Lightning, contracts are created, verified, and executed between two or a small number of participants. Any need to create consensus in the case of disagreement is provided by the proof-of-work of the Bitcoin network.

In the case where a large portion of the people that are working for Blockstream are co-founders, you might find it useful to actually talk to them.

Yeah, it doubled. In absolutes, it still grew less than Bitcoin in the same time frame. Especially, it grew less than most peak and dip ranges we see in the linked Bitcoin chart.
Seriously, a company like Coinbase stopping to perform two transactions whenever a customer withdraws a balance is going to have about as much impact on daily transactions as Ethereum had…

With every transaction on the blockchain, Bitcoin would ever only scale linearly, neither "pruning, IBLT, weak/thin blocks or future networking improvements" change that. That means that for 3 tps we need 1MiB blocks, for 30 tps we need 10MiB blocks and for 300 tpc we need 100MiB blocks. For 3000 tps ~ 1GiB per ten minutes, and I don't think it would even be feasible to verify that in ten minutes.
Therefore we need something that scales better than linearly. LN is one such proposal.

Calling LN PoS is quite the stretch, and the analogy is not helpful. LN doesn't have a distributed consensus system. It merely provides a structure to find path along which payments get forwarded. This is achieved by a set of bilateral contracts. It's not a sidechain, and there is no mining, staking or blockchain specifically for LN.

Actually, I haven't taken "a math based economy class that covered the dynamics of monopolies (limited number of suppliers)". 
As payment channels with less than a hundred bucks volume could already be very useful, and Lightning nodes would require only little resources, the capital startup costs don't seem prohibiting to me. There is some market advantage to having a lot of connections obviously, but that comes at the cost of regulatory scrutiny and less privacy for any payment channel partners. Reasonable up-times would probably already be achievable with a Raspberry Pi from home. Direct payment channels with frequent business partners provide additional convenience and cost-saving.
Maybe I'm too optimistic, or overlooking something glaringly obvious, but it doesn't seem completely clear-cut to me how this would necessarily play out.

Bitcoin doesn't compete with bankers. Bitcoin is a currency system. Bankers are free to and likely to adopt Bitcoin in the case that it should become ubiquitous. Bitcoin might allow new forms of banking, and might influence the ability of central banks to control money supply, or provide the possibility to constrain Fractional Reserve Banking. It may successfully compete with other currencies.


Yeah, maybe a bit of that will happen.


Yeah, but the intrinsic value doesn't explain its current trade value. By the way, the intrinsic value of bitcoins are that they are rare, do not tarnish, are much easier to carry around than gold, and transcend nations, politics, and religion.


BitTorrent and Bitcoin aren't that similar actually, besides being peer-to-peer networks and opensource projects.


Taxes are an obligation your nation state imposes on you regardless of the currency you use. Bitcoin companies will be regulated. It seems likely that it will be infeasible for nations to regulate the Bitcoin network, due to its decentrality.

Woah, wall of text… Alright.


Correct, if nobody were using Bitcoin, they'd be worthless. In fact, this is common for all types of money, because for a successful money the carrier token is less valuable than the transmitted value. This happens to be true for gold as well, as gold is worth a vast multiple of its intrinsic value. 


The revolutionary about Bitcoin is that it is the first digitized currency that doesn't rely on a central issuing and mediating entity. That discovery has facilitated the emergence of a multi-billion dollar currency network, which gives the system's units utility and therefore value. Just as with most other money technologies, the technology itself is not valuable per se, it's the network that the currency has created that is valuable. That's also why [altcoins in general don't stand a chance]( Even as they copy the technology, they can't copy the network's headstart, and the utility scales exponentially with the network's size.


Intrinsic value doesn't explain gold's value (see above). BTC miners are taking a reasonable risk based on the expectation that a technology that hasn't had any outages for seven years isn't going to end over night.


No, they don't. In general, altcoins are intellectually barren, and fizzle out before long. There might be a small number of sufficiently distinct coins that survive by catering to niches, but all-in-all the global scope and power of the network effect make it a winner-takes-it-all market. Therefore, most altcoins don't have a fair argument whatsoever. Especially, as a merchant, there is no incentive for me to accept a coin whose only utility is to be traded for Bitcoin. I'd rather rely on my customer to trade it himself, and then pay me directly in Bitcoin. 


"How is market value determined? Through marketing." is an oversimplification. I'm quite sure that there were other factors that played a role in the success of the Xbox besides marketing, e.g. exclusive games and its online-gaming features, but I'm really not interested in the console market, so I'll just assume that it's a false analogy.


[The US is an oligarchy]( not a democracy. \*tongue in cheek\*. Bitcoin is a decentralized meritocratic open-source project. They kind of operate differently, so *without getting into specifics* – that's another false analogy.


… um. I really don't care who that guy is, what he thinks, or whether he invests in Bitcoin. If the above are his arguments, then I have provided supple explanation why I think they are not convincing.


… um. I really don't care why you buy Bitcoin, or that you think so little of the Bitcoin project. Personally, I don't buy bitcoins to subvert the banking system. I'm just convinced that Bitcoin is a superior form of money technology, and that the banking system is headed for another crash. Besides, Bitcoin looks healthier than ever to me.


Everything does. For example I find it really hard to send food via email.


Sorry, it's just really not that good.


Um. Sure. What's this Peter's job again? I thought you said he's rich from advising other rich dudes?

If a transaction doesn't get mined without the "tip", I don't think it's accurate to call it a tip. Fee is fine. But thanks to you, I just realized that I had been using "block reward" very inconsistently.

`block reward = block subsidy + transaction fees`

@_date: 2019-07-16 20:01:52


AFAIK, minimum change in Bitcoin Core is still a hard coded arbitrary value.


Yes, but that approach turned out to not be very effective. However, it may be informative to repeat those experiments with changing fee rates.


The Branch and Bound coin selection algorithm systematically searches the combination space of the wallet's UTXO pool to \_find an input set which will not create a change output\_. In this context the minimum change is only used for the fall back coin selection algorithm if Branch and Bound does not yield any solutions. The minimum change in this context was still picked arbitrarily, although two different values were tried (IIRC, the magnitude of \`minChange\` had little impact, I'm not sure whether anyone else explored this further).

The "kilobyte" in Fee per kilobyte is traditionally 1000 bytes, not a kibibyte. In fact, blockchair uses 1,000 bytes, because it matches the fee rates on other sites that give the fee rate in satoshi/byte.

Since `vsize == size` for non-segwit transaction, it didn't make a difference before segwit activated as there couldn't be any segwit transactions. ;)

"the lower diagram already shows the size minus three quarters of the witness size" is the virtual size of transactions. So, he's not labelling it as vbytes, but showing the vsize.

Miners already set a soft limit by being able to produce smaller than maximum blocks. 
If a miner is in support of keeping the blocks small they already can choose to set a smaller limit for their own blocks. What Garzik's proposal BIP 100 does, however, is to enable a minority of miners to limit the block size for all, while on the other extreme allowing much bigger growth quickly if all are in favor. *It is a fact* that the outcome is much less predictable. It is also much more complicated than just doubling the maximum. It seems a bit too forward to schedule the next twenty years at this point, but I would be very much in favor for scheduling two or three doublings in the next few years. It's just smarter to keep it stupid simple.

Making Bitcoin more divisible and changing the amount of Bitcoin to be distributed are two very different things.

They can start mining an empty block once they have the previous block's header. 
They can only start on a filled block however, once they have processed the transactions of the block as well. Otherwise if they include a transaction that was already in the last block, their new block would be invalid.
So, until they have processed the transactions, they are mining on an empty block in order to not lose their hashing rate.

There are just under 2^256 possible public keys.
To calculate the address corresponding to a public key, you input the public key into the RIPE-MD160 hash function. 
A hash function is a function that deterministically converts any input into an element of a given set. You can think of this part like counting a class of 20 students into two equal teams: 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,… 
Although Hash Functions do a bit more than that: Cryptographic hash function are practically impossible to invert, so in this case, everyone can check if the address belongs to the public key by repeating the hashing, but it is impossible to guess the public key if you only know the address.
For public keys to addresses, the 2^256 public keys are mapped to a set of 2^160 addresses. Since there are more keys than addresses, but every public key can be mapped to an address, there must be in average 2^256 / 2^160 = 2^96 keys to each address.

Just got around to looking this up. In English the [plural of nexus]( is either **nexuses** or **nexus**.
Nexus, from nexus ("the act of binding together; bond"), derives from Latin, where words of fourth declension ending in "-us" have a plural form ending in "-ūs" (ū = long 'u'). Nexus being fourth declension, its plural is nexūs.
The plural ending "-ī" is used for words of second declension which also end in "-us", e.g. fili·**us**, fili·**ī**.
Neither has consistently transferred to English, one really just has to know the correct plural form e.g. alumnus (alumni), but on the other hand campus (campuses).

It's pretty much the same as with a Halving now: The only thing that changes is how many bitcoins may be created with the Coinbase transaction; except this time it drops to Zero instead of halving.
In particular, mining would have to continue in order to validate transactions, although it will then be completely funded by mining rewards. However, that will only be marginally different from the years before the last new coins, as it will will have been only satoshis per block for years before that.

Correct, however, if the split wasn't long enough to include a difficulty retarget, the difficulty would be the same on both chains, so the one with more blocks would win.
Should a retarget occur in the fork, the network part with more mining power would still have more blocks (and more aggregate difficulty), because it would reach the retarget earlier and afterwards both chains would go to a difficulty aiming for 10 minutes a block. As the stronger chain would have been longer in the new difficulty, it would have more blocks. And its difficulty would be higher, making it both longer and having a higher aggregate difficulty.

Blocks can be up to 3.7mb after segwit is activated. To remain compatible with non-upgraded nodes, non-upgraded nodes only download a stripped version of the block which doesn't include the witness data. This stripped block is compatible with the current consensus rules and adheres to the 1mb limit. The whole block will be bigger than 1mb though. The witness data is part of the block and not made up, it's just ignored by non-upgraded nodes because they don't understand it.

You're doing a pretty good job presenting your point of view. It's a refreshing breather from the usual noise that surrounds BU.
However, I don't share your optimism about miners converging at Schelling points solidly. I perceive this point to be based on optimistic expectations and gut feeling, but the provided evidence doesn't make this outcome seem sure.
The miners are the only non-voluntary role as they are employed _and paid_ by the other shareholders to order transactions and provide security. The incentives of miners are also the least aligned with other shareholder roles: While their long-term ROI does depend on the health of the network, there is some berth on how they could profit from gaming the system within that framework while the brunt of the cost of their decisions would be almost fully externalized to other shareholder roles. As the cost of a fork is high, and hard to delimit, they'd have some sway before retaliation. Additionally, very few individuals control large portions of the hash rate which reduces the cost of creating powerful cartels.
Miners have abused their role before, e.g. to cheat at Bitcoin lotteries.  
In my opinion it is a terrible idea to increase the power of the miners in the system by giving them governance functions.


This doesn't seem right to me: Any miners imposing their will surely wouldn't be selling, and production of mining equipment is even more centralized than hash rate today with AFAIK 70% of the hash power produced by one company.

@_date: 2017-02-05 23:29:51
Thank you again for your contribution to this discussion. I think it's a pretty accurate summary of the case of 75%+ of the hash rate forking with broad support of the other shareholder roles.
However, at this point my perception is that while there is broad support for a capacity increase, I don't see much support for BU. I see a possibility of BU reaching 50%+ of hash rate support, but find it highly unlikely that the proposal finds broad support of other shareholder roles.


From all that we have seen from miners, I sincerely doubt that it will be easy to get any to commit to such a bold move. So far they have been extremely shy to take clear positions. There's probably a huge chicken egg problem here, as it's pretty hard to gauge support of other shareholder roles before the hard fork actually goes ahead.
Therefore, the most likely outcome for the next months seems to be further stalemate. I'm curious to see if BU will manage to fix the issues with their consensus proposal, how Litecoin's segwit signaling will impact discussion, and what the reaction to the upcoming release of Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 next month will be.

Privacy allows us to be ourselves, to have private thoughts, to spend time without being judged by our peers, and to vote for what we think is right. Privacy is a fundamental building block of a functioning society. A cashless society could work, if payments remained private. However, as it's currently looking, it would give lots of people access to data that they _will_ misappropriate to spy on their spouses, neighbors, colleagues, or children.

Since nobody can say how Bitcoin will fare in 28 years, I think this is a bit of a gamble. If Bitcoin appreciates as much in value as some hope, you'll make your kid extremely wealthy over night.
You say "a couple" hundred, so that would mean that you lock up most of your bitcoins. If Bitcoin peaks long before that, you might miss out on a huge opportunity. 
I think I'd set aside a smaller sum, e.g. 21 bitcoins as a fixed stash for him when he turns thirty, and treat the remainder as a source to diversify in a few different things, to liquidate at opportune moments, or to enable your son to gain experiences to help broaden his horizon, e.g. school exchange abroad, traveling, or a little capital to help a project off the ground that he's really passionate about in his curious years. Also, you'll have some more left, if you decide to have more kids. ;)
You could also give him smaller amounts of money at earlier stages in his life to see how he deals with that and to let him make some mistakes to learn from.
I think giving such a wealth to him later in his life, i.e. at 30 is a good idea, as he'll have time to form his character and will perhaps not build his adult identity around it as he perhaps would be tempted to, if he got it at 18 or 21.

That sounds splendid, but are you sure? That would equate to 3,600,000 transactions per block. Transactions would still need to reference the outputs that are used, even if all the signatures were aggregated. Am I missing something, or are you already thinking of LN for that number?

Economic activity is what happens with the confirmed transactions. It's hard to measure the origin of the economic activity, but surely it's easy to agree that new nodes just set up to inflate some count would not add economic activity.

The Lightning network is not a sidechain.
LN transactions are native Bitcoin 2-of-2 multisig transactions where each side of the payment channel hands the other a transaction they signed and the counterparty can unilaterally countersign to activate.

@_date: 2017-02-06 00:22:45
It's not that hard to understand: To hard fork you change the consensus rules and leave the system defined by what was previously considered valid. This can be done at any point by anyone with any amount of hash rate.
Since the hard forkers leave the previously established consensus system, the miners have no coercive force: The ones that leave simply cease to create valid blocks from the point of view of those that remain. Those that remain don't contribute to the hard forked chain. Mining power simply doesn't matter for the hard fork beyond influencing the time until block intervals reset to normal.

That's correct, yet, there are only two factions that could be interested in that: People interested in defrauding through doublespends by sending a transaction without fee, and the doublespend with fee, and miners that want to maximize their profits at every cost.

I think "hating another crypto" is missing the point here. Only a very small amount of people actively detest altcoins – rather most people don't expect them to be a longterm success:
I agree that altcoins have been and continue to be beneficial for the development of the cryptocurrencies and the community.
E.g. Dogecoin certainly has been a viral and wildly successful introduction to the concept of cryptocurrencies, and many altcoins have provided testing grounds for interesting experiments that all can learn from.
Yet, the altcoin niche of payment networks would seem to be a classic "winner-takes-it-all" scenario, as there is a strong network effect hugely benefitting the largest network. Especially when there are hardly any functional differences between the incumbent and challengers, I am baffled why anyone would expect an underdog to be economically successful. So, I can see why someone would be excited about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple at once, but I am puzzled for someone to root for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin at the same time.

No, that's false. Segwit actually increases the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:10:04


That's actually one of it's worst features in my opinion. This appears to weaken the consensus mechanism from strongly convergent to a socially driven process. Attempts to change blocksize would cause multiple chaintips for blocks at times, or the whole decision process is moved under the wing of a miner cabal altogether. Neither seems to be an improvement of the mining situation.


Obviously, I'm not privy to the conversations of the miners among themselves, and it may be very well true that a huge block of the miners is coordinating already (which is actually really scary altogether). Yet, at the very least there appear to be a few that are outspokenly against adopting a hard fork proposal. I feel that there is too little information and too much wishful thinking all around about where the miner come down about this. It would be really good if we managed to make miners more of a part of the global conversation.

The confirmation time derives from the algorithm that resets the [difficulty]( In Bitcoin the difficulty resets every 2016 blocks in such a fashion that with the same amount of work available as for the last 2015 blocks, it would take an expected 14 days to produce the next 2016 blocks.
Other coins use different schemes to reset difficulty, such as Litecoin matching the same 2016 blocks to 3.5 days, leading to a target interval of a 2.5 minute block time, or reset the difficulty on every block with algorithms such as the [Kimoto Gravity Well]( In general, the target interval for a block is a design parameter the creator of a new coin can pick.
If the block interval is too short, i.e. around the amount of time of block propagation, it will lead to the chain always having forks competing for the tip, devaluing the first few confirmations. Too big a block interval will lead to big time spans in which there is nothing showing as a stepping stone for all the proof work done. The ten minutes picked by Satoshi Nakamoto do work, but I wonder if he would pick a shorter time now, if he were to do it again.

A block is a result of successful mining. Essentially, it is a set of updates to the network's ledger, the blockchain. 
Among other data, in the block, there is a timestamp, a reference to the previous block, and whatever transactions were validated in the block. Most significantly, it also contains the "Coinbase transaction", which collects the mining fees and creates the block reward for the successful miner.

4MB would mean that the stripped block portion is empty, while all of the data is in the witness. I'm pretty sure that this is impossible, and 3.7MB is close to the maximum that can be constructed. Anyway, the type of transactions necessary to create 3.7MB blocks don't get used on the mainnet, AFAIU they are practically useless and were just created to test SegWit.

Yes, it could actually happen before 50% mining support (as we have seen), but a fork seems almost certain to happen after 50% mining support.
However, it would only be a permanent fork if the BU-chain continues to be the heaviest chain:  
If the 1MB-chain were to pull ahead of the BU-chain at any point, it would still be the heaviest valid chain by BU's rules. Thus, all of the BU-chain would reorganize back to the 1MB-chain.
Since the BU-chain consists of larger blocks (or it wouldn't have forked away in the first place), the number of transactions confirmed on the 1MB-chain would be smaller than on the BU-chain. This means that some of the transactions confirmed on the BU-chain would not have been confirmed on the 1MB-chain yet. It's almost certain that people relying on the BU-chain would suffer from doublespend attacks.

This has also been asked on Bitcoin.Stackexchange here: [What would happen if a portion of the Bitcoin network was separated from the rest of the network?](
In short, both parts of the network will continue their own chain at a slower pace (since only part of the mining power is available), and the longest chain will be prefered on reconnect. Transaction from a shorter chain not confirmed in the longest chain will first return to the unconfirmed transaction pool and then eventually be confirmed in the longest chain as new blocks get mined.
As confirmations would still be coming in, and propagation would hamper doublespends within one part of the fork as before, the only major risk would be someone being able to spend coins on both chains.

From the top of my head, I see the following challenges:
* It's too complicated for the average user to use, mostly it is too easy to lose your funds.
* It's too complicated to understand, thus hard to create trust in it.
* It's still pretty hard to get Bitcoin.
* Right now, the protocol cannot sustain mainstream usage.
* Within a domestic market, there are few advantages for average users.
* It is unclear whether Bitcoin will ever at any point stabilize in value. The increased currency risk could lead to the network being used for transmission, but everyone trying to hold bitcoins as short as possible, driving the currency into the ground.
* While it is hard to effectively forbid use of Bitcoin, it is comparably easy to forbid shops from accepting it. Such regulation could drive Bitcoin into blackmarkets, making them much less attractive for most organizations and individuals.
* Overt miner centralization could give a minority of the mining power the ability to block further development of the Bitcoin protocol, or in turn, a mining majority the power to dictate protocol changes.
* Just because it is better in many aspects than other payment networks, doesn't mean that it will ever breach the mainstream. It could go the way of the internet, or always remain restricted to a small subspace of society, such as for example Linux personal computers. Perhaps, a sufficiently sophisticated centralized payment network/national cryptocurrency could curb the market available to Bitcoin.

Getting back to you, somebody [answered the question]( Essentially, the recipient gives a riddle that only he knows the solution of, and the sender initiates a chain of transactions that can only be redeemed with the riddle's solution.
To build on my previous example, Charles would tell you: The riddle is `1bc9852364a8aa073daedb3965716ab63d84570c645b091f535a3677010d9984`. You initiate a transaction to me, which can be can redeemed with the solution to the riddle, but is time locked to returned to you, if I don't solve within a few hours. In turn I'll offer a transaction with the same riddle to Alice, as Alice does to Bob, until finally Bob relays to Charles. Charles knows the solution to the riddle, and solves the transaction's riddle to get paid the money from Bob. Bob uses the riddle's solution to get the money from Alice, Alice solves my transaction, and I use the riddle's solution to get the money from you.
Thus, nobody can claim a payment before paying, but when paying gets the means to claim their payment in turn: The middlemen can't run with the money.

The end of coin creation is mostly like a reward halving: The only thing that changes in the mining process is the number of bitcoins that may be created with the Coinbase Transaction; except this time it will drop to Zero instead of halving.
In particular, mining would have to continue in order to validate transactions and maintain the security of the Bitcoin network, which then will be completely funded by transaction fees. However, that will only be marginally different from the years previous to that, because the reward will be less than one bit for more than twenty years before that.
The probability and cost of a 51% attack will be determined in the same fashion as now: It is a function of the amount of hashing power available to the network versus the amount of hashing power available to the attacker. As it is impossible to determine the mining power one hundred years in the future, I don't think this can be answered seriously.

Well, unless you are taking payments for huge amounts of money, there really isn't much of a reason to wait ten minutes. The first transaction spending the same UTXO takes precedence, so really you only need to wait to see whether you see money spent to your address on the network, i.e. the time until the transaction is relayed, for reasonable safety. If you use a payment processor such as BitPay, they check with multiple nodes, whether the transaction was received as well. It's just not economical to force a double-spend for a few bucks, and if you just shoot off two transactions at the same time, chances are slim that you receive one and the other gets confirmed.

The Lightning network is not a sidechain.
LN transactions are native Bitcoin 2-of-2 multisig transactions where each side of the payment channel hands the other a transaction they signed and the counterparty can unilaterally countersign to activate.

No, the security of the transaction is the same as with other Bitcoin transactions. For direct payments there can't be MITMA, as both payer and payee are part of the transaction in the first place. 
For the routed payments it is being implemented at the moment.
The plan is to make it  
a) not possible for nodes in the middle to see who the origin and the target of the payment is via [Onion-Routing]( i.e. Alice in the above payment can only see that I'm requesting from her to forward a payment to Bob. She doesn't know whether Bob is the recipient, nor whether I was the source. She doesn't know about anyone beyond the next neighbors in the payment chain.  
b) That either all payments get done at once, or none. That way, no node in the middle can take the money. I'm not sure how that's implemented, so [I've asked a question here](
@_date: 2016-03-08 21:16:56
Scalability improvements provided by SegWit:
* SegWit reduces the complexity of verifying transactions, allowing faster block verification after a block is found. Among other things this reduces the time that mining pools spent mining empty blocks. 
* SegWit reduces the memory required to keep the complete UTXO set in RAM, as you only need the transaction data to check whether a UTXO is available, before looking up the Witness data from disk.
* SegWit allows to speed up synchronization of the blockchain by disregarding signature data for old blocks (e.g. everything but the last 10000 blocks).
@_date: 2016-03-09 17:50:27
SegWit is scheduled to be activated in about two months. Another capacity increase is proposed for next summer. According to Joseph Poon's contribution at the MIT Bitcoin Expo, Lightning might come online this year. As far as I am seeing, the memory pool has returned to regular levels after last weeks pressure via what appeared to be a large amount of chained transactions returning back to the originating address ultimately. All wallet software is finally getting fee estimation that it should have had anyway. 
Could you please elaborate on basis of what data you came to the conclusion that *"it needs to scale now"*? Besides, could you please elaborate on basis of what evidence you think that a capacity increase by means of a blocksize hardfork were to be introduced faster than SegWit? If anything the last 10 months of debate have shown that it would not be possible to deploy it in less than two months, unless threatened with catastrophic failure. The requirement of paying 4¢ for a transaction is not catastrophic failure.

I'm not sure where you got that LN would need to handle all transactions, or that it must also handle high-value transactions.  It could of course, but only between participants that have large sums of liquidity bound to LN. It seems obvious to me that on-chain and Lightning payments would find a natural balance: Fees and confirmation times pushing transactions toward LN and the value limitations, arbitration function, differing privacy trade-offs pushing back towards the chain.
I thought more about your post, and it seems to me that the problem with above extrapolation is that you are skipping ahead through the time-frame Bitcoin adoption will take. Currently there may be a couple million Bitcoin holders, and perhaps 500k *active* Bitcoin users. It seems plausible to me that it would be possible to on-board the latter to Lightning over the course of a few weeks or a couple months, and the former would trickle in over a much longer time as would new users.
Bitcoin usage will not jump to tens of millions users over night, so there'll be some time to react to growth patterns. Additionally, one must account for increased adoption of Lightning also reducing the pressure to collapse channels. If you have too much money, you could spend from LN preferentially, if your channels are almost out of funds, you could just open another and rebalance from there (or actually, you don't care much anyway, because there is hardly any of your value locked in at that point).

While it is not represented with a clear date on the roadmap, the [Core capacity roadmap drafted by Gregory Maxwell]( after the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop in HK points out that after groundwork has been done and other capacity upgrades have been exhausted, the plan includes blocksize increases:
















What Greg is writing with lots of details to correctly represent the circumstances, I'd interpret that as: **SegWit first, some transmission upgrades, then bigger blocks in ~2017 or 2018.** As SegWit should be a capacity increase just slightly smaller than a HF to 2mb now, increasing size next year or 2018 by another factor 2 would give us even more than just the blocksize increas to 2mb now.

Coinbase solves the scalability problem exactly like the legacy banking system does: It requires you to entrust your money to a service provider which allows them to keep a ledger for their user accounts. Moving money between any two accounts turns into a database edit. This scales very well obviously, but makes you completely dependent on the service provider.
Lightning Network solves the scalability problem by adding a "contract layer" on top of the blockchain. Any two nodes will be able to create a shared fund of which they can re-negotiate the allotment among themselves. No third party is needed as long as they can agree. When a disagreement occurs or one tries to take advantage of the other, either node can execute the latest agreement as a regular Bitcoin transaction on the blockchain. This scales better than the pure blockchain approach, because while transactions happen as renegotiation of payout slices it generates no load on the blockchain whatsoever. It can however not be decoupled from the blockchain as the execution on the blockchain is equivalent to getting a "court ruling" on the contract: It's required as a fallback to enforce fair behavior. Facilitated by [hashed timelock contracts]( you can create "multi hop payments" through your business partner to reach business partners of your business partner. The fear of "centralization" for LN comes from the idea that business partners with lots of connections will be more useful to span a network, and therefore there will be a small number of extremely well connected nodes through which most payments will be channeled. This is a suboptimal situation, but much less problematic than full counterparty risk as in the Coinbase scenario. It also might be mitigated when each node has at least four payment channels to other nodes.

* We'll see Bitcoin Core 0.14 released hopefully next week (we're currently on release candidate 3). It's a nice upgrade with lots of code clean-up and optimizations, but unfortunately, there are few new features visible to the users. However, it will e.g. be notably faster at initial block download, store the mempool across restarts, and bring support for opt-in replace by fee. The latter will allow users of Bitcoin Core that activate the feature to update unconfirmed transactions with higher fees.
* There are currently several altcoins trying to deploy Segregated Witness, Litecoin on the forefront. According to Charlie Lee (the creator of Litecoin), more than 70% of the Litecoin mining power has told him that they will signal for Segwit's activation. He was hoping that it would happen within 2-3 months. Currently, readiness is at about 22%, it will activate at 75% for Litecoin (instead of 95% as in Bitcoin). If the promised support will appear, and we'll have a testing ground for Segwit in another live network. Hopefully, this will demonstrate the safety of the upgrade, and encourage Bitcoin miners to follow suit.
* I'm afraid that Roger Ver is too invested into his support of BU, so that he will not reconsider his stance even in the face of successful activation on an altcoin.— Perhaps he would, if Segwit support levels got close to 50 or 60% of the hash rate. He has quite some following in Asia, if he actively supported Segwit the remaining miners might actually go along.
* There is often concern among BU supporters that a Segwit activation would preclude further blocksize increases. The opposite is true: since the separation of transaction instructions and signature solves the quadratic hashing problem, and mitigates the danger of attack blocks, most Bitcoin developers see it as a necessary requirement for further blocksize increases. In fact, after activation of Segwit (and some studying of the results), I'm fairly sure that work on [blocksize increases via extension blocks]( would be one of the focus areas.
* Another benefits of Segwit activation would be the advent of Schnorr signatures, which would give us another 20-30% compression of transactions, and would ultimately allow all signatures for a transaction to be condensed into one signature. This would massively decrease the cost of e.g. coinjoin transactions giving us better scalability and fungibility.
* Concerning Bitcoin Unlimited, I don't see any chance of the proposal being supported by the technical community. The changes to the consensus code are radical and untested, it would be utter folly to go along. Should the BU support rise further, I wouldn't be surprised if a permanent fork initiated by BU supporters ensued. We'd probably have a brand war on the hands then, as both groups would try to claim the name Bitcoin for their network.


I'm not sure they do. Mining is foremost a business. Many of the mining outfit's bosses don't have a technical background. I've recently talked to a Bitcoin developer that had been traveling in China and got in touch with the community there. He assessed that on the one hand, that due to the language barrier information flows between the Western and Chinese community were restrictive, and that it caused the Chinese community to be lagging behind in the blocksize debate by about two years. Since there appear to be few people reading content from both communities, those few have a lot of influence in shaping the content of the Chinese community. Apparently, among those r\btc is more popular than r\bitcoin…  He also got the impression that there is a worry that more fungibility would get Bitcoin in trouble with the Chinese government. Additionally, the interests of the miners don't necessarily fully align with those of the Bitcoin users. Even if they completely understood the merits of the solution, some might prefer BU as it would likely give more power to miners.




The miners have been pushed into taking a political stance where actually they should only perform the paid service of ordering and securing the transactions. Naturally, they are very conservative as they don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Beside the Hong Kong Agreement disimproving the situation, there are a lot of myths and libel floating about, especially concerning Blockstream and Bitcoin Core. Quite a bit of that has been repeated ad nauseam: 
I'm afraid that many people are spreading these as fact, not knowing any better.— It's a grand learning experience for all of us. A lot of mistakes have been made, especially in communication, but I'm optimistic that in the long run we'll get out of it stronger.

Thank you for this comment. I'm finding this position increasingly appealing. It is obvious to me that two incompatible visions for Bitcoin have established themselves, and become more convinced by the day that trying to satisfy both in one system will prohibit either from making any progress. A live and let live fork could actually be a boon to both projects, letting them move forward quicker.
I'm just worried that it will not be a "live and let live" situation:
* The market could be confused by both projects claiming to be "Bitcoin"
* Volatility would skyrocket with sell-offs on both sides
* Mining attacks on the opposing fork should be expected
* The timing of the fork is completely unpredictable as there is no explicit activation mechanism
* The BU hardfork is in danger of reorganizing back to legacy chain if latter pulls ahead
* No replay attack protection has been implemented
* A messy split of the Bitcoin ecosystem may destroy trust in Bitcoin's immutability altogether

One has to keep in mind that off-chain transacting is essentially what we already have with our current banking system, with the same risks but less regulation. Also, off-chain transaction systems are walled gardens that only allow transactions to other users of the same service. As such they will tend to further centralize. If one gets too big, so that most business is only on their service that could endanger serious amounts of money and actually make the blockchain less useful. As long as it remains easy to leave the off-chain services, everyone uses them only for small amounts, and there are several different ones competing for lime-light it is a decent solution to offer microtransactions.
Payment processors will at least for the intermediate time be the only passable path to accepting bitcoins for any business that cannot afford to hold on to Bitcoin earnings and ride the price chart. Should the Bitcoin eco-system establish itself broadly and some stability be introduced, merchants will be able to deal in Bitcoin directly and payment processors might actually lose their importance. If the processors play their cards right, they will still be much more convenient than direct acceptance though. Since the payment processors essentially just buy the bitcoins of the merchants, there really isn't that much of a counterparty risk. Also, they must be redistributing a lot of the bitcoins directly again, in order to stay solvent. Also, it is fairly easy to change to a different payment processor, or start accepting Bitcoin directly, so it doesn't seem that the failure of any one of the payment processors would present a single point of failure.

`420,000%2016 = 672` At 20 minute blocks it would take ~18.7 days until the difficulty is reset after the block. At that point difficulty would be reduced to `3/5` i.e. 12 minute blocks, which would take ~16.8 days to reach the next reset.


No, you've exaggerated beyond a worst case scenario. And you're starting from unrealistic assumptions. More than 50% of the mining power came online in the last few months, it is ridiculous to suggest that 50% of the mining power is going to be turned off. How can you not do more research before writing a piece like this? Perhaps at least have someone proof-read it before posting?
Edit:  
To better explain the above calculation: When the Halving occurs, there are 1344 blocks left of the 2016 block cycle until the difficulty reset. The miners would not drop out before the Halving because they'd try to mine as many valuable blocks as they can, so the "worst case" would be that they sharply drop out exactly at the Halving. 
1344 blocks at 20 minutes are ~18.7 days. If the network was running at regular speed before, it would have already taken ~4.7 days to the Halving in that difficulty cycle. Therefore, the reset would reduce the difficulty to `3/5` of the previous difficulty. Since the mining power was only enough to find 20 minute blocks, the difficulty reduction speeds up blocks to `3/5 * 20 = ~12` minutes.  
Granted, 18.7 days at 20 minute blocks and more than two weeks of 12 minute blocks aren't great, but it's not four weeks of 20 minute blocks.
Edit2: Corrected the mistake I made. The 672 blocks are before the Halving, not after it. Thanks to for checking my calculation and pointing it out.

I was wondering why you were talking about sidechains, but I think I got an inkling. Did you think that Lightning Network is a sidechain? That would explain the confusion, because [Lightning Network is not a sidechain](
Also, Lightning Network would be significantly cheaper than on-chain transactions, so I don't really get the argument of added costs in comparison to on-chain payments.


1. Core is an open group. If you want to propose on-chain increases, you can code them up and get people to talk about them.
2. A lot of Core contributors are in support of increasing capacity, that's why they put thousands of work hours into SegWit, and other improvements.
3. Core is much larger than just Blockstream. Blockstream's business model is highly dependend on the long-term adoption of Bitcoin. All of their development is open-source. If they were to torpedo Bitcoin as I've frequently seen suggested, there is absolutely no problem for anyone else to take their code and fork away or move to another coin. You seem to think that the Core contributors have some sort of ownership of the network, but all they can do is offer their software and hope that it will get used by the network. I sincerely have trouble understanding how their business interests are even in conflict with Bitcoin's growth, let alone them depending on actively crippling Bitcoin. A lot of them are independently wealthy in Bitcoin and truly passionate about the project. It's pretty disheartening that people would actually believe they are sabotaging the network. If I were you, I'd try to get to know them better and actually read stuff they write, instead of just reading about them.


That lack of trust has been cultivated. If you want to find out whether it's deserved, I suggest that you actually try to question what you know about Bitcoin and start delving further into the material. About 15 months ago, I had a pretty good talk with Matt at a conference and got the chance to ask him some hard questions. I learned a lot from his answers, and I've learned a lot about Bitcoin and the limitations of it since then.

Maybe it's due to selective attention, but I don't remember reading anyone making the explicit claim that 2 channel operations per year are actually sufficient.

I've looked at the content of the Lightning site. The picture you posted is from a presentation for a ***Meetup* in Februar 2015**.  It's seems to be a napkin calculation, which I get from some other arbitrary number choices such as **7 billion users**

Couldn't agree more. Luckily, it's not, and you know it. 
But talking about BU: "emergent consensus" is essentially exactly "please don't do this". It gives a single digit percent miner the option to split the BU network once per day for a dozen blocks (taking longer to find because of lower hash rate on each tip) unless all EB values are the same or people manually switch chain tips.

Have you considered that you can also buy balance on Lightning by other means than transacting on the Bitcoin blockchain? E.g. if a major exchange runs a Lightning network node, I can trade fiat and have them send Bitcoin to refund my Lightning payment channel. Similarly, it would be possible for brick and mortar shops that earn Bitcoin on Lightning to offer selling some of that balance to customers for cash.

I'm not saying that we have a fundamentally different view on the topic, I'm merely rerunning my thought experiment as requested with the changed input parameters. In fact, your scenario of "all nodes running segwit" is pretty restrictive and makes all the potential ways for hardforks unappealing.
I'm not sure at this point whether a hardfork would be beneficial or detrimental for Bitcoin. On one hand it would rid us off a whole lot of crazy narrative and increase our chances for SegWit activation, on the other hand I'm worried that it would lastingly damage confidence in Bitcoin depending on the amount of support it may have.
However, if the BU fans would just finally actually act on their apparent full confidence in their consensus disimprovement, we might finally get to see how their experiment fares and could move on to more interesting endeavors after watching it crash and burn.
@_date: 2016-03-03 09:09:36
Say, you and I want to open a payment channel.
1) **Putting funds into Lightning**  
We both send 0.05 BTC into a shared 2-of-2 multisig address. This requires a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.  
As a "balance sheet", we each create a 2-of-2 multisig transaction that pays out 0.05 BTC to you and 0.05 BTC to me. I sign one payout transaction and give it to you. If you want to put it in effect, you need only add your own signature and broadcast it to the Bitcoin network. Vice versa, you give me your copy of the payout transaction that you have signed and I have not yet. The "balance sheet" is a regular 2-of-2 multisig transaction in the Bitcoin network, it just isn't valid yet, because it doesn't have all signatures.
2) **Payment**  
Now I want to pay you 0.01 BTC. We each create a new payout transaction ("balance sheet") as before, but this one says that you get 0.06 BTC and I get 0.04 BTC. Each of us gets a transaction signed by the other to that effect.  
To make sure that neither of us can use the old payout transaction the other signed previously, we each create an "anti-cheat" transaction: It's a transaction that spends the outputs from our first payout transaction to the other.  
I.e. when I try to activate the (now obsolete) 0.05 - 0.05 BTC balance sheet, you broadcast the "anti-cheat" transaction where I agreed that my 0.05 BTC output get send to you directly. This is safe for me to give to you (and the whole network), because the "anti-cheat" can only be activated as a response to the use of an old balance-sheet. (This anti-cheat mechanism is why Lightning needs the Transaction Malleability fix from Segregated Witness.)  
With the state as described above, I'd have to be online to catch you trying to cheat, but obviously it wouldn't be safe for me to keep payment channels open, if I'd have to remain online all the time. So, to encourage others to help with the "anti-cheat" transaction, we set a small portion of the "anti-cheat" payout as a bounty that anyone can sign. Now, we can send the anti-cheat transaction to all nodes on the network, and whoever wants to will watch for old balance-sheets being broadcasted. When it happens, they sign the bounty to themselves and broadcast the "anti-cheat".
3) **Network payment**  
Alright, now you and I can send money back and forth thousands of times, with instant effect, yet without adding a single transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain. Yet, on the other hand, if one of us ever tried to defraud the other, it would be instantly resolved on the blockchain to their own detriment. Pretty spiffy, but not terribly useful yet.  
By the theory of [six degrees of separation]( everyone is connected to any other participant by only a few hops. 
Let's say you want to send money to Charles, who is a barista and just made you some coffee. Charles is a friend of Bob, and Bob is a friend of Alice, while I have a Payment channel with Alice. For illustration purposes, let's assume that each payment channel has two BTC in it, equal split. You do not have a direct connection to Charles.
Our "network" now looks like this:  
       snowkeld &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Xekyo &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Alice  &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Bob  &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Charles
Now, since you don't have a direct payment channel to Charles (and it would be very inefficient if you had to create a payment channel with every business partner you ever meet), you have to route your payment through the network. Instead of only writing an update of the balance between Charles and you as I described above, this becomes a concerted effort: Your wallet finds a route from you to Charles that has a) sufficient liquidity, and b) least fees. To make a payment, each involved payment channel updates their balance. With a payment of 0.01 BTC for the coffee, this updates our network to:
       snowkeld &lt;-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --&gt; Xekyo &lt;-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --&gt; Alice  &lt;-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --&gt; Bob  &lt;-- 0.99BTC ----- 1.01BTC --&gt; Charles
As you can see, the balances at the ends have shifted appropriately from you to Charles, but the other participants have the same balance (although shifted to other payment channels). It's important to realize, that the transaction can only go through completely or not at all. Either we all update the balances, or no one does.
Now, imagine that you don't have only the one payment channel with me, but you have maybe a dozen payment channels with other users. :)
4) **Trade-offs**   
 * You cannot receive more money through Lightning in one transaction than the sum of your payment channel's value.
 * Your transactions don't get stored on the blockchain for eternity, (i.e. better payment privacy), but on the other hand you keep using the same address allowing users that know who the address belongs to to monitor your balance (less personal privacy).
 * Instant transactions! But your money is locked up in a payment channel, which you first need to execute on the blockchain if you want to do a regular Bitcoin transaction with the money.
 * Less fees! Transactions on Lightning don't require a full blockchain transaction fee, but if you route through others' payment channels, they might want some for the liquidity they provide to you. As other Lightning nodes are competing to transfer your payment for you, this is likely to be much lower than a full transaction fee on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:18:34


That's just not looking at the full picture. Lightning network only scales transactions not users. LN users will need to perform transactions on the blockchain to create and settle channels. As LN would likely be a pretty decent payment network, the utility of Bitcoin would rise immensely. Demand on the blockchain would likely still be sufficiently high to keep blocks full, but LN would offer a valve for too much fee pressure. Altogether, fees would probably go down a bit, but still be decently sized. With further blocksize increases to scale for more users in the long run, it seems pretty obvious that miners would still make a killing in the long run. Right now they're just strangling the goose that lays the golden eggs.

Actually, when there is a persisting chain fork, separation of balances on the chains is guaranteed to happen starting 100 blocks after the fork (when the first coinbases mature), so it's only sensible to not pay on both chains. I don't know how that would be screwing people over.

I read a number of Bitcoin resources daily, including both prominent Bitcoin subreddits. While I agree that probably a majority of the Bitcoin participants want larger on chain blocks, I don't share your perception that this translates to majority support of the BU proposal. In fact, I perceive the BU proposal to have
* no support from the dev community
* little to no support from exchanges
* no support from hardware wallet manufacturers
* some support from miners
* fringe support from reddit users
* luke-warm support from a few Bitcoin services
* no support from any other open-source projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem
Most notably, the only explicit support I note is from a few isolated individuals, a few miners attempting a power-play and a few redditers that have a vastly different vision for Bitcoin than I do.

Blockchain space is more valuable than what it costs to purchase it. Therefore, it's natural for it to induce demand, and subsequently the natural state for it to be near saturation. The transaction spike last week has pointed out that some wallet software needs to upgrade their fee estimation, besides that it's been causing major Bitcoin companies to improve the efficiency of their blockspace usage. For anyone running decent wallet software, the increased transaction load caused graceful degradation if they even noticed any problems at all.


The deployment of SegWit might take some time to reach all wallets, but especially big players can save a lot of money by implementing it quickly. Even though some wallets will lag behind, a lot of transactions should quickly be using SegWit. Especially, if/when transaction load should spike again.


As you are well aware, not the blocksize increase is the issue, but that a portion of the community is trying to force it on the whole community.

Hi. My name is Mark. I've recently finished my M.Sc. in Computer Science at a reputable university and wrote a Master thesis on Coin Selection in Bitcoin. I'm known as [Murch on Bitcoin.Stackexchange.com]( where I've been a moderator for the past three years. In the past half-year, I've given a talk at Scaling Bitcoin Milan, have been to three Bitcoin related conferences and given a lecture and three more talks at meetups or universities, as well as having had meat-space conversations with more than a dozen of the Bitcoin and Lightning developers. I like to think of myself as being somewhat informed about what's going on in Bitcoin.


Segwit has been live on Testnet for months. It's finished and ready for activation. If it got the necessary support over night, it would be live within four to six weeks, as it has to achieve 95% support during one difficulty period and then will activate after a fallow of one additional difficulty period. Many of the wallets are ready to support it as well. The BitGo CTO for example said this week that they alone are currently responsible for 16% of the transactions, and the activation of Segwit would therefore immediately free up about 8% blockspace just from the traffic that BitGo creates.
As soon as Segwit is live, some testing of LN on the Mainnet could start. There are seven teams working on implementations of LN now, and some of them have been alpha testing on the Testnet for months. It would probably not be prudent to immediately switch large amounts of traffic to LN yet, but being able to run it on Mainnet would boost development as more people would try it out and give feedback. There could be some limited LN usage within weeks after Segwit is live.— It's not some sort of far-future project. AFAIU, there are decent routing solutions in place to cater to a network of up to several ten-thousand nodes, and R&amp;D is on-going for larger network sizes.


The Lightning Network proposal describes a structure to provide secure, instant transactions negotiated only among the concerned users. To that end it leverages payment channels which essentially are jointly managed balances between a pair of users. Opening such a channel requires a multisignature transaction on the blockchain. On the channel then, there can be an unlimited number of payments between these two parties, of which the final balance at some point can be paid out again to the participants in one more transaction on the blockchain. When LN participants have multiple open channels they can offer to forward payments from one channel to another, quickly spanning a large payment network. Thus, LN condenses cryptographically secure, trustless off-chain payments to a small number of on-chain payments.
I've written a bit more about LN here: 
* [What is the Lightning Network proposal? What problem is it trying to solve?](
* [How does the Lightning network work in simple terms?](
**Therefore, the issue is that Segwit can indeed be ready within a few short weeks.** Meanwhile, the BU solution that Roger favors appears to be technically unsound to me (and most Bitcoin developers). It would likely lead to a permanent split of the network.
Why blocks tend to be naturally full and why hardforks are contentious can be read in the summary posted here yesterday:

I've created a question on Bitcoin.SE to collect this frequent question you're answering here. Would you please consider posting your comment there? 
→ [Why do people expect Bitcoin Unlimited to cause miner centralization?](
@_date: 2016-01-31 19:39:57
There was a discussion on Github about adding a date for a Blocksize increase on the scaling roadmap. luke-jr suggested [2017-2018]( It was my own interpretation that this would be a likely timeframe, as other Core developers have previously said that there would likely not be a Blocksize increase in 2016, although SegWit does help by itself through increasing the capacity.
@_date: 2016-03-09 17:04:04
Actually that's not what I read. Core devs as well as Lightning Devs have stated that the blocksize would need to increase eventually. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:07:58
Thank you, Adam, for taking time to address concerns of the community! I'd like to point out that it perhaps isn't clear to the above asker from your answer that Lightning is an open system with no real way for Blockstream to monetize it.
Edit: (added the missing word "clear")
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:37:12
If at all, they're sending a message that they will not be part of EC. They didn't adhere to the format of BU (6 or 7 digits for AD max), so it was a manual message and "/EB1/AD999999999/" reads as 1MB blocks for the next 20k years.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:27:03
vbenes got the right numbers in his link (or at least I got the same ;)). 
The probability of not finding a block for one hour is about 0.248%. So, a block interval of at least one hour would be expected to occur once in 403 blocks.
I wrote another explanation how to calculate that over at [How can we be sure that a new block will be found?](
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:20:46


SegWit blocks are valid under the old rules.
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:42:10
If you know that such software exists, why do you proclaim that a solution to the problem would necessarily be centralized? o.0 


It's in the works, and we don't need it yet. Simpler solutions will be sufficient for quite a while, and when they reach their limit, we would see a gradual decline, not a hard failure. It's not like we'd jump to 1 million nodes over night, when we only have a few thousand full nodes today. Even if there would be multiple sparsely connected Lightning network clusters that would be a massive improvement. It would also not preclude them remerging when better routing becomes available.

I'm not worried at all for hodlers, they got any amount of breath. But I'm a bit worried about how much it would cost the Bitcoin industry sans miners per day when the transaction capacity drops to a fraction. I'm not sure how much breath they have in such a struggle.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:10:01
I'm not proposing to change it, but it does seem wrong to claim "indefinite inflation subsidy would destroy Bitcoin". If we had a constant block reward all along, the amount would still be limited at any point in time and it would still be always inflating at a slower rate, i.e. 100% in the second year, 25% in the fifth year, 12.5% in the tenth year. 5.26% in the 20th year, 2.56% in the 40th year and so forth. Still, mining would always be subsidized by the same reward.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:28:37
Or an economic majority disregarding a block that doesn't and thusly discouraging a miner from accepting a SegWit breaching transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:46:08
Bitcoin mining solves the BGP in that it allows the honest generals (=miners) to coordinate their effort (=same chain) when they agree on the goal (=same protocol).
Bitcoin mining does not enable the generals to coordinate which goal to reach nor facilitates coordination when they are trying to reach different goals. This is seen in the fact that block size changes under the BU paradigm would require out of band communication and manual adjustments to node settings to converge towards consensus.
What you claim is simply not correct.

Okay, but if the economic majority stays on the original chain, what do you think will happen with the price on the forked chain? Many from the "economic majority" would dump the new token and use it to buy more on the old chain. What do you think, how long would it take the miners to switch back when they realize they are mining a token massively losing value meanwhile block rewards are spiking on the original chain? I'd guess it'd be somewhere between one hour and a day.
If the new token isn't traded on exchanges, it would probably get a lot more messy. I'm not sure whether it would hurt said miners more not to get revenue for a day or the economy to get only 1/4 of the processing.

@_date: 2017-02-04 17:32:13


No, it's not. It's actually more complex, because you have to add  code to mitigate the attack vectors that a hardfork would introduce such as replay attacks and the unknown support level of the broader community which is less of an issue for a softfork because it can be rolled out gradually.


Segwit creates bigger blocks, probably around 2MB or slightly more. Nothing about a hardfork is simple.


Your speculation actually divulges that you are prejudiced against the people that have built up Bitcoin for years, and you completely disregard the trade-offs that come with a hardfork.

@_date: 2017-03-24 16:18:35
Yeah, although [BU signaling means nothing]( especially since [only 2.5% of the nodes run BU](
I'm abreast of things. ;)
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:47:23
That's just not right. A thought experiment:
Let's assume there are 1000 nodes in use by users and businesses ("the economy") and 90% of those nodes run Bitcoin Core, 10% BU.
Of the mining power, 75% switches to BU-based bigger blocks, and starts up another 1000 nodes.
There are now 1100 BU nodes, and 900 Core nodes.  
The BU nodes see 100% of the blocks produced, the majority chain with 75% hashrate creating a block about every 13 minutes and 20 seconds, and the minority chain with 25% hashrate, which creates a block every 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, the 900 Core nodes just see a drop of the hashrate to 25%. They reject the BU blocks because those are *invalid* to them. Each node fully enforces all rules of Bitcoin on any data it receives before accepting it. The BU miners might as well could have just left the network from the effect on the Core nodes. The 1100 BU nodes however just represent 10% of the economy. Some nodes spun up to inflate numbers don't increase the amount of economy they represent.
 It is in the interest of any serious Bitcoin user to have one or a few at their disposition to be sure that the rules of Bitcoin are being followed and they aren't being cheated. Since nodes have a direct benefit to their operator they don't have to be paid. Miners on the other hand perform a service on the network level. The direct benefit to their operator would be minuscule in comparison to the cost— if it weren't that they are paid by the network to perform this service.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:11:05
Nobody said they're infallible and a lot of them have said that they would like to increase block size in the future. However, they have clearly stated that they think a hardfork is too dangerous at this time. They want to see the effect of SegWit first before they make further scaling plans.
So, one major requirement is "no hardfork", the other major requirement is "bigger blocks immediately". You propose as a compromise a hardfork to 2MB. But that isn't a compromise that's compatible with "no hardfork".
The compromise is to increase the blocksize without a hardfork first. It's been a compromise since it was first presented at scaling Bitcoin almost fifteen months ago.

No you don't, that's just false. Each node will be able to initiate payments from knowing their neighbor peers and in the beginning probably also the whole network's topology. Even later, you don't need a coordinating authority, you'll just coordinate with your business partner to find a route between the two of you.

Please fork off whenever it's convenient. There is a certain longing for the moment the BU community leaves our network— we could finally stop wasting our collective time rebutting all the misinformation escaping its echo chamber and get on with more productive endeavors.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:39:46
You were alluding that the activation of SegWit alone would cause a hardfork. I've shown that it would require a second party attacking SegWit or BU blocks appearing for that to happen. You then shift goal posts and say that some of these second conditions are likely. I disagree, because 
* miners producing a SegWit infringing block wouldn't be able to sell the mined coins in the above scenario where all nodes run SegWit, thus would likely not gain a HR majority to accept that block.
* it appears to me that even most miners that are signaling for BU actually don't run BU compatible software
* a minority HR actively forking them from Bitcoin by rejecting SegWit would be a much more bold move than I expect from any miner with millions invested in mining hardware. It would also likely be economic self-destruction.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:30:26
That's not right. [It's an actual blocksize increase]( Blocks will be bigger in size (up to 3.7MB, but probably more like 2MB in average) and it will allow more transactions to happen per block.

"Is segwit better than nothing? – Yes."
"Is Segwit better than looking forward to a real fix? – Absolutely not."
→ I assume that he means to say that segwit is not fulfilling his requirements for a congestion fix.  
On the other hand, I think that the only thing that BU guarantees is at least two persistent chain-tips, so I don't really understand what alternative he might have in mind.
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:59:18
You'll read some potential routes from the topology map that you have collected, or when the network is larger later, you'll combine the neighborhoods of yourself and the recipient to find a route, or even later probably connect neighborhoods with beacons like in a border gateway protocol. Then you'll send an onion-routed message to a candidate route: The purpose is twofold, each layer of the message presents a contract to the recipient, and instructions on who to send the remaining layers. By forwarding the message each hop agrees to the contract but only gets to know his predecessor and successor in the chain. Only the sender and receiver know that they are endpoints of the chain. If the final message is delivered to the recipient, the contract becomes enforceable. The final message includes a "secret" which the recipient "sells" in a cryptographic contract to the second last hop. Thus the recipient is the first to get paid, and in the same action the second last hop gains the secret which he in turn can now use to get his money back (plus fee) from the third last hop. This continues until the first hop gets the money from the sender in exchange for the secret. All the hops are locked in with a Hash Timelock Contract (HTLC), so each can take some time to enforce the payment.
If a route is declined by one of the hops, you'll hear back about that and try another route.

You need to separate the chain histories of your Bitcoin Unlimited Temporary Tokens (BUTTs) and bitcoins. This can only happen by having a transaction that is only confirmed on one chain. The safest way to produce such a transaction is by tying it to newly minted coins only available on one chain.

@_date: 2017-03-15 14:04:27


SegWit transactions and SegWit blocks are are valid transactions by today's rules. 
A blockchain composed of old-type blocks and SegWit blocks would be valid to all current node software. Old-type miners could add regular blocks, SegWit miners could add SegWit blocks. If old-type miners don't change their behavior, they would never store SegWit transactions in their mempool and thus never mine them either, because they appear non-standard to them. The nodes would enforce this by prohibiting any block that infringes SegWit's rules. It would be a softfork, converging to one chain even with a minority hashrate mining SegWit.
It would only become a hardfork if 
* a majority of the hashrate enforced infringement of SegWit's spending rules
* a majority of the HR created blocks larger SegWit's limit
* or, a minority of the HR actively rejected SegWit blocks.

"The 21 million BTC limit is technically just as flexible as the max block size". Correct. Yet changing the unit limit and changing the transaction throughput are completely different in that the former breaks the "rules that they originally agreed on" and the latter doesn’t. Classic straw man fallacy.

Um. Yes, that certainly was an interesting talk, but it's now two years old and LN has evolved quite a bit since then. I think I may be more up-to-date than you on LN if you cite that two year old video, because I've met multiple LN devs at different conferences in the past months and talked to them about their ideas concerning Lightning.— "Payment processors" doesn't really ring a bell at the moment.
So,  if you're gonna watch that video again anyway, do please get a bit more concrete what you're talking about, because I don't think it's a good investment of my time to watch that hour-long video again just to figure out what you're alluding to.

In that second video, Roger was debating John Dilley. Jake later filled in for Roger. I actually watched that debate (well at least until Roger left), and Roger merely keeps repeating the demand that his use-case should be catered to in Bitcoin. John Dilley explained in detail why this clashes with the reality of how Bitcoin works which Roger didn't acknowledge in any way. Excuse me therefore that I disagree with your assessment, and perhaps allow me to say that it appears to me that you weren't watching closely if you can't even identify the participants correctly.
In fact, what Roger claims to want in that video would be exactly catered to with the introduction of lightning network. It's really confusing that he can't seem to identify that the solution for his requirements would to help activate Segwit and to be an early adopter of LN.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:00:31
Well, there is literally no way to enforce such a promise, so your request is not reasonable. 
I also don't understand why you're advocating filibustering of all work on capacity increases just because you entertain the possibility that later work may not be to your liking. We're too far away to assess the effects of earlier steps and there still is no trustless pegging mechanism for sidechains. So I find it sincerely baffling that you would consider this a credible reason for protest at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:23:35
The bug was in xthin, which isn't part of any released version of Bitcoin Core.
The idea of an adjustable block size is an interesting one, but the execution in BU is broken and not worth supporting.
@_date: 2016-03-05 07:30:44


Well, I did my best to convince you otherwise. If you have another concrete point to that end, I'll try to answer it, but perhaps it'll just take some time to think about it.  ;)


Yes, LN works especially great for low-value transactions, because LN limits the amount you can receive to the total value of your payment channels: Once all your payment channels are fully shifted to your side, you cannot receive more money without opening additional payment channels. It'll also be much more economical to put small transactions there, as payment will likely require a volume based fee (in line with the liquidity provided) instead of a flat transaction fee. Also, LN obviously scales much better since the transaction only needs to be seen by the parties involved in the payment.


Some sort of balance will be reached: Big transactions, opening and closing of payment channels, well, generally transactions that want to use the advantages of on-chain transactions will have to pay for room in the blockchain. On the other hand, instead of a hard limit, there'll be LN to provide a valve for transaction volume pressure with other trade-offs.
I don't think that blocks will actually get emptier, as long as there is some room, someone will jump to fill it. Still, blocksize will have to increase in the future to serve the transactions that can only happen on the chain. 
So, yes, in the future there may be a point where transaction fees on the blockchain make $200 payments uneconomical outside of LN.

@_date: 2016-03-31 18:05:44
The paper actually states that "[miners] indeed often rely on a separate, faster mining backbone to propagate blocks" which refers to the relay network. 
Since you were the one that brought up thinblocks and going from your second answer, you must then mean that thinblocks could help with propagation time to "non-miner" nodes. That's correct, but it comes at the cost of an increased bandwidth usage compared to regular propagation. Where upload bandwidth already is the limiting factor for regular nodes, and the propagation time isn't actually all that terribly important.

The promise was that the present developers would work on code for a hardfork and make it available to the public. It is explicitly stated in the document that the developers cannot commit Core or the Bitcoin network to a hardfork, because it's not in their power. That's what was signed. 
I've seen multiple hardfork proposals by Johnson Lau and Luke-Jr for example, so I don't see how the promise on that side wasn't fulfilled to the letter. Beside that there has been work on dynamic blocksize proposals.
Further, the Core roadmap includes multiple items that increase the on-chain capacity, starting with SegWit, followed by Schnorr-signatures, Signature aggregation, and MAST. Lightning Network would also probably evolve to provide a valve for fee-pressure. Further the Core roadmap _explicitly_ states that it is expected that the network increases the on-chain capacity further by blocksize increases.
Multiple Core contributors have stated that they would like the fees to be lower, but they first have to assess how the network behaves with SegWit activated to judge the risks and benefits of further capacity increases. I've talked to the CEO of BitGo this week, he said that they are responsible for more than 10% of all transactions on the network and a lot of their customers are struggling with the high fees. They'd quickly move their transactions to SegWit and by themselves free up 5% more blockspace right after SegWit activation. So, what does the community have to gain? Fee pressure could go down within a few weeks! A lot of work that has been put on hold because of the delay on SegWit would move up and provide further capacity improvements within months.
If we then don't even need another blocksize increase to maintain a decent fee level that's a **good** thing! If we need one, with SegWit activated we could do it via an extension block without a hardfork. So why should we risk splitting the network?
@_date: 2016-01-31 19:16:11
Yes, I agree. But unfortunately, even though perceived as such, Core is by no means a homogeneous entity. Many of the individual developers participate in the community under their own name, but none of them have the authority to speak on behalf of the project.
However, since Classic emerged, Core's communication has improved significantly. They have brought online their own [website]( with meanwhile 8 blog articles and three FAQs, including one to the [capacity increases]( It even has a section on [If there’s eventually going to be a hard fork, why not do it now?](
Unfortunately, even on their FAQ-section the content appears to be designed rather for correctness than accessibility.… But, it's better than before! ;)

As stated above, the BU supporters plan to provide ample support for separating coins as moving the coins on the BU chain will be trivial and on the Core chain all but impossible, meanwhile the high fees are incentivizing the miners to defect back to the Core chain.

To open a channel, you and a partner send money to a 2 of 2 multisignature address on the blockchain. That doesn't make LN a sidechain though. Sidechains are essentially altcoins that can be traded from and to Bitcoin in a fixed trustless manner. Thus, they have a consensus mechanism, a blockchain and their own tokens. In Lightning Network transactions are solely processed by the involved people, there is no blockchain, and the token's traded are bitcoins. LN just doesn't fit the concept of a sidechain.

Why do you call it "Lightning Coin"? Lightning Network doesn't have its own tokens, it merely aggregates several transactions between two parties into one initial and one exit transaction. I've written an introduction here: [How does the Lightning Network work in simple term?]( I'm happy to discuss this more, I've been [researching it a bit]( lately.


Lightning Network can only aggregate transactions because they are exchanged on a different layer than the blockchain. It is relying on the blockchain to settle any disputes though, so it wouldn't work without the blockchain either. The mechanics of sending transactions are very different, which is why it can have different trade-offs. Onion-routing wouldn't work for Bitcoin transactions directly.  


It was one of the most interesting exchanges on this thread, different views, but respectful exchanges and some reasonable arguments delivered on both sides.


That's not an accurate assumption. I didn't downvote anything and I've only upvoted a few of the posts that furthered the discussion or made good points.  
But since you seem to be asking where my position is on this matter: I think that we'll need to have some capacity increases in the longterm, but I don't think that we're currently witnessing a crisis. I've engaged a lot with both viewpoints. I used to be much more sympathetic to the blocksize increase a few years ago, but now I'm very close to Core's position. There are some interesting points on both sides, though. The thing that I dislike most is the manner this discussion is led. It's full of hate, misinformation, ad hominem, jumping to conclusions, and only thinking the worst of the other side that one can see.  
I've been trying to post some of the most misunderstood topics to Bitcoin.Stackexchange.com as questions, but it seems to me that many people aren't interested in actually understanding but are so embittered at this point that they've become completely closed for other views.


I am not sure whether we'd agree on all points, but llortoftrolls is doing a fine job of representing my opinion in most cases.


The problem is that the blockchain can currently only scale linearly: When you want to do twice as many transactions, you need twice the storage, bandwidth and computing power for verification. (Except for some small one-time optimizations like Schnorr signatures.) To actually facilitate some sort of mainstream viability there'd need to be a mechanism that scales better than linearly. Lightning network could provide such a solution as it could aggregate large numbers of transactions to very little blockchain space. One example that comes to mind would be that e.g. Bitpay and Blockchain.info had a payment channel with each other: All transactions that users of Blockchain.info perform to buy from merchants represented by Bitpay could be aggregated to the payment channel and settled in larger chunks. If a whole network of Lightning Network participants were to emerge we'd be able to use blockchain space vastly more efficiently.

Thank you for your input, but this is not about regular node behavior:
The linked post refers to an alternative block propagation mechanism, the relay network. It's used to connect miners and transmits the blocks in a compressed way to significantly reduce transmission times when a block is discovered.

BIP152's express goal is not latency minimization, but peak bandwidth reduction. It does reduce latency in the average case, but not as its main purpose.
The current solution of choice for the miners to minimize latency is the Relay Network.
As far as I understand, BIP152 adds an additional way of requesting blocks, it does not replace the legacy system. Since Relay Network remains, there are two distinct synchronization methods, and two alternatives on the main network. The quoted criticism refers to the idea of giving up Relay Network completely in favor of an improved standard protocol. Hence, it does not apply here.
(Everything AFAIU.)
@_date: 2016-06-28 19:22:10
I'm confused because what you describe doesn't seem to have anything to do with my understanding of Lightning network. I'm not sure whether that is due to a vastly different evaluation of LN's properties or that you didn't get familiar with how it works. Did you read the description of LN that I linked above?
Lightning "payment channels" are literally 2-of-2 multisignature Bitcoin addresses. It's not like Counterparty et al that use Bitcoin anchors to transfer their own tokens, in fact there is no Lightning token. It just transfers Bitcoin with Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:09:29
I'm with Peter on this one.  
 Already most users have online wallets and thin clients. Especially the former will be under great pressure to implement authentication into payments. If a sufficient portion of the transactions already complies with such a standard, it'll be simple for governments to require the couple existing payment processors to collect this data on every payment.  
And that's how we'll lose the ability to make private payments with the majority of the merchants.

Here are a few comments:
* You switch between a capitalized and lower-case version of Bitcoin (for the protocol). Commonly, a **b**itcoin is one unit of the currency, and the protocol, idea, or community is **B**itcoin.
 
*  &gt; "It does this by effectively converting the Bitcoin blockchain into a medium where account balances among participants are “eventually settled” (i.e., a settlement layer)."   
  
It doesn't *convert* the blockchain, because that is already true right now. It *employs* the blockchain in this role.
* 


I'm not a native speaker, but I thought *corollaries* are synonymic to side effect or consequence. Is it possible that you mean *similarities* here?
* You sometimes write "The Lightning Network" but later "the Lightning Network".
* In the list of additional benefits, you switch between Lightning and Thunder networks, but it may not be clear to the reader what the distinction is (General concept, a specific implementation), perhaps remind them here.

Not to pop your bubble, but Bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream adoption. The coming few months will be exciting surely, but it won't be the "Great Bitcoin Awakening".
Look around: Capacity remains fairly low, scalability solutions are still under development, and there are hardly any use-cases in which it would be advantageous for "muggles" to use Bitcoin. Software is still hard to use, and requires a lot of background knowledge.
Before the "Great Bitcoin Awakening", the project must mature further. We'll need Lightning network not only implemented, but somewhat time-proven. We'll probably have gone through a few capacity increases, hopefully even our first hardfork. More structure will need to form to scaffold the entrance of less-technical users.
Hopefully, we'll manage to bend the Bitcoin protocol a bit further towards future scalability, before it becomes impossible to change at all with mass adoption. (See TCP, IPv4,…)
What's up for the next months, might serve perhaps as a bit of a wake-up call to the wider technical community that Bitcoin is something worth looking at. Fintech might get more riled-up. But mainstream is away another three to five years at the very least.
@_date: 2016-06-07 15:46:10
Compact blocks only add an additional way of exchanging block data. If they were broken, the worst would be that a bit bandwidth were wasted before everybody resumed using the (still functional) legacy system.
Testing is surely important, but we're only talking about how nodes talk to each other here. What would be the point of delaying such an improvement for a quarter year, just so it wouldn't appear next to some other completely unrelated improvement?
What exactly would you think is the advantage of the community knowing there will be a new enhancement in three months? And how is that different to the [announcement of the release schedule]( already being done?
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:20:59
How is their business shady? They've been talking about it on conferences, here on reddit, and on Podcasts such as LTB.
Pull requests happen when stuff is done. Lightning network is not finished, but it's right there in the open. All four implementations are opensource.
I think that regular Bitcoin wallets will eventually use both the blockchain and Lightning network as they offer different aspects of pushing around money. As you know, putting micro transactions on a blockchain for all eternity won't fly. Lightning offers a way to do instant payments and micro transactions trustlessly, right there with Bitcoin.
Read up on it and come back when you know what you're talking about. Shittalking something you haven't even researched yet is boneheaded.

I took time to read your post again, but I find it arduous to extract the message.
- The post provides definitions, but immediately questions them, see e.g. "ideal money". 
- It defines archetypes, but then only generalizes over those in the following
- It features many sentences with over fifty words and multiple clauses
- There are tangents on language constructs that don't aid the message
- Redundancy should be curtailed, e.g. "the most optimal fashion possible" could be trimmed to "the optimal fashion", "A common interest is shared" common interest already implies that it is shared
- The frequent "I think" and similar can be dropped. It's clear that the author is presenting their own reasoning.
If you want to be read more, aim for simpler sentences, refrain from unnecessary tangents, and remove content that doesn't contribute to your message. 
I was curious what I'd end up with, so the following presents a quick edit of your initial post applying some of my suggestions:


Ever since Satoshi put the 1mb cap on the block-size, the community has been divided between those that want a increase in the limit and those that do not. This creates an uncertainty in the future quality of the currency, affecting the adoption and the value of Bitcoin. “Big-blockers” seem to want to increase transaction capacity transitioning it to a global currency. However, big-blockers are challenged to convince Core and the network to adopt such a proposal. On the other hand, Core seems to have no intention in even addressing this issue. Bitcoin is in a state of flux. The purpose of this writing is to end this flux.
[Removed the Rheomode explanation, it doesn't add valuable progress towards your message.]
**The Re-solution of Gresham’s Law and Tier’s Law**


Mundell unites Gresham’s law with Tier’s law by taking a higher level perspective. He encapsulated both of the laws, and because of his succinct language brought this generalized perspective to global attention. 
Following Mundell’s insight, we can begin to re-solve the future of Bitcoin, without breaking Gresham’s or Tier’s law. If Bitcoin, unchanged, became the new gold standard, people began to hoard it, and the velocity of fiat started to     increase, we might attribute this to Gresham’s law. On the other hand, if we raised Bitcoin’s transaction capacity to facilitate micropayments, and Bitcoin grew to a world currency obsoleting fiat, we might recognize Tier’s law.
**Ideal Money: A COMMON Goal**
Both sides share the wish to use Bitcoin in the optimal fashion. Another common interest is to bring our global financial system into order. Two positions contend: Big-blockers wish to optimize Bitcoin as a currency, and small-blockers   think of Bitcoin as a digital gold and a platform to run optimized currency systems on top of.
Views may diverge on the definition of ideal money, however we should take note of Nash's meditations on the subject. His definition for Ideal Money condenses to ‘money that doesn’t degrade in value/purchasing power over       time’. Now this is a slippery definition, it is not in itself a solution (this is why it is called IDEAL). But it does provide us a vision that we might strive for.
I have always understood this to support the small-blocker position. Bitcoin providing a safe haven for inflation would incrementally force governments to print money of better quality resulting in an “asymptotic” approaching to “Ideal   Money”.
We can begin to re-solve both sides of the debate by applying another quote from Dr. Nash:


Seeing the possibility (like Tier’s law states) that the people could adopt Bitcoin in a short period of time and drop fiat currency quick enough that governments have no time to adjust, Bitcoin could become a global currency with a      moderate inflation rate for some period of time. This could bring our global financial system into order as Bitcoin could either be continually optimized, or replaced by improved currencies in the future. This path though, does require a higher transaction capacity (ie bigger-blocks).
**The Re-solution of the Block Size Debate**
Now, we have brought about a great insight. It can now be shown that Ideal Money could be brought about using EITHER vision for Bitcoin. And this possibility changes the nature of the problem. If both sides have legitimate claims to        bringing about order to our financial system, then it is no wonder that sincere players are passionate and adamant in their agenda!
Some people will read this essay and question the claim of having re-solved the block-size debate. However, it combines two otherwise separate parts such that a new holistic perspective arises for the group. By showing that both sides can lead to our shared goal, I have served the stated purpose of this article to help bring Bitcoin out of flux.
Rational players on both sides now have a common goal and reason to come together. And it becomes clear that if some disputant doesn't admit that there are rational players on both sides of the debate, such a player must be seen as       insincere. Now, the focus can be on finding the optimal PATH for Bitcoin rather than on winning the debate. It is my hope that this article should alleviate pressure on Core, and in turn should bode well for the present day and long term health and circumstances of our beloved currency.
Consequently, I have now changed my stance on the block-size debate as a previously devoted small-blocker. I am no longer afraid of big blocks, and I hope now the reader no longer is either.
Feel free to use the above in any fashion you want.

@_date: 2016-06-13 21:45:47
Yes of course, as each chain tip considers the other to be invalid they don't care what the other has confirmed. The full nodes would probably block each other after a while, for sending invalid inventory, but the SPV nodes should bridge that, as transactions would never be invalid and SPV nodes don't send blocks.

Even when transaction rate increases, it seems unlikely that first confirmation will happen quicker. Could you explain why you expect Bitcoin payments to get easier in physical stores?

But, since you are asking so nicely: Here is a play-by-play and commentary of what was written.
asks whether nullc thinks it's a priority to improve latency of the standard Bitcoin relay protocol instead of relying on an external solution.
responds that 
1. Latency minimization is only paramount for miners.
2. The rest of the network prioritizes bandwidth minimization instead.
3. Trying to fulfill both goals with one system would be complex and constrained by the regular development process of Bitcoin Core.
4. Instead, it is easier to satisfy the different goals with separate solutions which additionally creates a fallback system.
5. Having a quickly evolving external solution allows exploration, and provides the flexibility required to serve the needs of miners.
6. Once a good solution for a latency optimizing protocol has been worked out, it will be worth the effort to add it as an alternative to the Bitcoin protocol.
7. Mining is already largely disjunct from other activities in Bitcoin, so it makes sense to serve the miner market separate from the rest, instead of bending over backwards to try to keep everything in one solution.
8. In the long run nullc would like to reintegrate mining support to Bitcoin Core, but other contributors actually push for a complete separation of concerns.
Now, we're talking about BIP152. It's a relay improvement to **minimize bandwidth usage** which also happens to improve latency slightly. It is tailored to the regular Bitcoin network. For the miner's which don't care about bandwidth but need to minimize latency ruthlessly, it's nowhere near being efficient enough to present an alternative to the Fast Block Relay Network. It also doesn't label itself as a replacement for FBRN. 
Therefore, your above line of inquiry seems nonsensical, as in fact, BIP152 is not trying to satisfy both minimal latency and minimal bandwidth.

Node counts have been fairly stable for years and therefore likely represent actual public nodes. When the number has significantly changed in the past, this has been taken note of, for example when a large number of Classic nodes came online within a short timeframe last year.
A softfork should only be activated by the miners if they perceive community support for it. It is indeed not trivial to gauge that, but since the biggest community platform, node counts, projects, and companies have publicly announced their support, it seems plausible that there is good support for the proposal. If miners now also signal readiness for activation, it seems highly implausible that your scenario which depends on there being 1) a mistaken activation of segwit, AND 2) a hardfork to take back the activation,  is sufficiently likely to be a blocking issue for segwit.
The tradeoffs in activating a hardfork are very different to those of activating a softfork. You should perhaps read this mail by Pieter from 2015:

No. A hardfork splits an ecosystem, forces a decision on every stakeholder, introduces replay attacks, and other risks. An altcoin is new network that can only influence the old network by attracting opt-in.


If you lag behind with adopting consensus changes, you have no risk in the case of segwit, as you're not making transactions that use segwit. In the case of a successful hardfork as explained above you evade the risk by not being part of the network anymore. So what is your argument then?

Hash rate signaling makes sense for soft forks, because a soft fork converges as soon as sufficient mining power switches to the new version.
Mining power isn't sufficient for hard forks. The whole ecosystem must be ready for a hard fork. That can only be ensured by having the code for the hardfork in the software several version cycles earlier.

Un-upgraded nodes will never give out a SegWit address, as they don't know how. Thus, they will never receive SegWit outputs. They will simply not keep track of SegWit transactions before they are confirmed, because they don't know how to interpret them. However, once confirmed, they'll be in the blockchain and unchangeable as any other.
Since SegWit only activates after 95% of the mining power signals readiness, any miner trying to spend an output to themselves would be breaking consensus rules and creating an invalid block. Since 95% of the mining power is disregarding this invalid block, it'll lose the attacker his block.

I agree that it should usually be clear from the context, but whenever there is more than one topic being discussed, it's easy for both to come up. it's just impractical to have the same word mean completely different things in one scope.

There have been no hardforks in Bitcoin before. Altcoins are a project fork, not a hard fork.


It has been taken in account and dismissed as unlikely. I don't see why you're repeating yourself. You've not added anything interesting to this point.


If you're unwilling to change your wallet code, you're fine in the case of a soft fork, you're still part of a functioning network and being protected. In the case of a successful hardfork, you end up on a chain that has no mining, and no way to restart mining unless new mining power joins it, or you _change your wallet code_ in order to reduce mining difficulty. Your argument is broken.


Option 2 comes to pass when all mining power joins the forked chain, and you're stranded and unwilling to restart the legacy chain by lowering difficulty. It's really not that hard to understand.


I agree with Pieter and I don't find your position interesting enough to discuss it further.

@_date: 2016-06-28 00:44:06
Honestly curious: 
My understanding is that Lightning proposes that payments are forwarded with onion routing. Therefore, only your neighbor knows who the payment came from and he cannot tell whether you are the originator. The only one who knows who he is interacting with is the recipient, and he doesn't even need to know your Lightning address, as the payment flows to him from one of his direct contacts.

Running a full node gives you some security assurances SPV nodes don't have, give you full access to the complete UTXO set, and (if you're running it as an archival node) the full blockchain.
SPV wallets also leak information about the addresses they're interested in, meaning that a full node gives better privacy.

The cost of validating a transaction is mostly the blockspace it will later occupy. Therefore, the transactional volume is not critical, but the transaction fee per data size. Since blocksize is capped, to maximize the revenue a miner should select transactions with the greatest fee per data.
- Miners want to maximize fee per data
- Senders want to minimize fee per transferred volume
Therefore, transactions that transfer more money can be more generous with their fee and more successful on the fee market.

As soon as a block contains SegWit transactions, the actual blocksize will be bigger than the current limit. It will also contain more transactions than currently possible. That's a blocksize increase.

Bitcoin is less robust than many people think. Many worry that it will never gain broad acceptance. However, premature adoption could be even worse as large swaths of people would be poisoned against the project when it doesn't fulfill their overhyped dreams.

We used to bump against the soft cap, and the first full block was produced in 2013, two weeks after the blocksize became a configurable variable in Bitcoin-Qt.
1. the cost of bigger blocks is externalized

3. the probability of blocks going stale has been significantly reduced by compact blocks, validation speed-ups, and relay optimizations.
Therefore, none of those points indicate that miners would limit their blocksize to network sustainable rates.

Well. Let's recapitulate:  
* I stated that there are no messages preserved where the creator of Bitcoin explained his reasoning.
* You answer that it was discussed on Bitcointalk (implying that I'm wrong)
* As evidence you provide some discussion from 2015, where someone claims to have had a conversation with Nakamoto and Hal, which both are gone. 
* There is no proof this conversation actually happened and the topic had already been politicized then. Ergo, that is not reliable unless other evidence is provided. Especially, since the limit was added 21 months after the Genesis block, which seems contradictory with the statement "The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.".
Hence, my statement from above that there are no messages by Nakamoto explaining his reason for putting in the limit remains true.

If you prefer a soft-hardfork, what is your objection to a softfork?
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:55:47
A combination of a hardfork and SegWit this year looks very unlikely. At most, a version that can signal for a hard fork which would activate spring 2017 could come up in the next few months.
SegWit was implemented and recommended to the Bitcoin network. It's now up to the Bitcoin network whether it adopts SegWit or not. 
Bitcoin still works as it is. So, I'm unsure why you'd want to dump your coins.
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:40:51
That's not correct. SegWit transactions still have a portion that is not in the Witness (the outputs) and thus is counted with a factor of 4 towards the weight. Further, SegWit transactions are slightly bigger than P2PKH transactions. I'm not sure how many more transactions it would be, but it's not ×4.  E.g. the weight reduction from a P2PKH to a P2PSWH transaction with two inputs and two outputs is 374 bytes to 208 bytes (discounted). A factor of ×2 or ×2.5 seems more likely.

With a sybil attack, a hacker with a botnet could try to control all nodes connected to a single attacked node. He would then control what information is received by the node: He could feed the node unconfirmed transactions and deprive them of new blocks.
Since the attacker would only have a botnet and CPU mining is so inefficient in hashpower, he would not be able to produce a significant chain, and probably not even a single block. Therefore, he could probably not pose as a valid chain, unless he adds a significant amount of ASICs to his attack.
It seems unlikely that this strategy would work on the whole network at once, because some nodes, especially including the mining nodes, are connected via additional communication paths such as FIBRE.

It is the stated goal of many vocal BU proponents to oust the Core developers from the Bitcoin project.


Sure, if they were forking the code and using it that would be awesome. However, here it is being suggested to fork the protocol, and to advertise the forked version under the same name as the original network. That's what's annoying.


BU goes around the BIP process which, as you said, is the established convention for development work on the _Bitcoin protocol_. It's being used by a number of projects in the ecosystem. Instead, they market their half-baked emergent consensus proposal directly to the community with spiffy colorful blog posts that ignore most of the previous conversation on the topic instead of seeking discussion in the developer community. How is that not populist? And yes, since it is about controlling the protocol development, I do call it an attack.
I do think that e.g. Andrew Stone [has a point about Code quality]( and I don't think that Adam Back's recent attack on BU is beneficial. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin Core project is not lacking good ideas for improvements, the bottleneck is code review. I'm sure that pull requests on the admonished code sections would have been appreciated. However, while BU's code may be great, I have yet so see a convincing statement why giving control over blocksize exclusively to the miners is a good idea, and how the emergent consensus is supposed to work in adversarial conditions.
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:37:02
What BU proponents call "Satoshi's original vision" is an outlook that is almost seven years old, but heavily amended by self-serving interpretation. Calling it "Satoshi's original vision" is intellectually dishonest.
The Bitcoin project has evolved and the challenges it faces are now better known. On that basis the experts that have worked tirelessly for years to further the project have commonly proposed a path on what they perceive the best way forward. BU proponents are caught in a mix of personal incredulity, no true scotsman and appeal to authority fallacies: 1. Many don't personally have the level of understanding to reach the same conclusion as the developers and thus arrive at the conclusion that their proposal must be wrong (or even malicious). 2. They believe that "real Bitcoin supporters" would never look outside of the originally provided set of tools to solve problems. Thus they don't consider the benefits of anything except the increase of the blocksize. 3. Satoshi created the Bitcoin project, thus he knew everything (own interpretations of his words notwithstanding). How it's silly to rely heavily on the opinion of someone that has not commented on the developments of the past six years in a fast evolving project surely is immediately obvious?!

While that might make a good argument in the long run, I don't think moving to μBTC now would be particularly useful, as it currently costs about ~180 μBTC to send a transaction. Just as people don't like fractions, it's cumbersome to talk about thousands of something. `mBTC` seems much more useful for the time being.

Satoshi was *the* expert in the Bitcoin project up to 2010 which is when he left and never was heard from again. Unless you generously assume that Satoshi could see the future, Satoshi was not an expert on the developments, challenges and opportunities in the Bitcoin Project of summer 2010 until today. Therefore, the direction of Bitcoin development in 2016 is a topic outside of Satoshi's area of expertise, and quoting him on this topic is an appeal to authority.

I think that the current and past stance of Core developers' stances on block size increases have been grossly misrepresented by assuming that one or two more vocal Core developers represent all opinions among the Core developers, and those opinions then having frequently been exaggerated.
* There are a few Core developers that are very conservative towards blocksize increases.
* There have been several proposals and discussions in the past that indicate both that there is interest in performing blocksize increases and research into how those may best be introduced into Bitcoin going on.
* Fact is that there was no consensus for a hard fork blocksize increase as the next step among Core developers, but there was consensus for SegWit, which is why SegWit was implemented and proposed to the community.
* I'm unaware of any Core contributors that completely reject the notion of ever increasing the blocksize. The most oppositional position is that the current blocksize is already somewhat too big, and the second most oppositional is that it shouldn't be increased _yet_.
→ The above diverse positions and discussions have been largely presented in r\btc as "Core (or Blockstream) will _never_ allow an increase of blocksize besides SegWit". In my opinion, this misrepresentation is a large contributor to the conflict we are seeing.

While you would be correct for regular multisignature transactions, this is not accurate for LN payment channels. The balance in the channel can only be changed if both channel participants agree, but the channel can be dissolved by a single participant, because the initialization or any state change is always conditional on the provision of a pre-image that essentially is an agreement of the partner that the channel may be dissolved at the current state.

But the more pressing question is, can we accurately tell which traffic is detrimental? We probably can't so it really doesn't matter whether traffic is organic or not.

What are "mbits"? Is that supposed to be one thousandth of a bit? /s

* [*milli*]( [m] is a metric prefix that indicates one thousandth of the base unit. It is prepended to the base unit's name.  
→ 1/1000 of a bitcoin is a *millibit****coin***.
* [*bit*]( is a portmanteau of **binary digit** and a base unit of information.
* *bit* in Bitcoin is being used as a moniker for one microbitcoin (one millionth of a bitcoin), and this is confusing AF because *bit* in the context of computer related topics is heavily associated with the above meaning. It also means that "bit" in the context of Bitcoin is next to "unsearchable".
**So, to everyone pushing for "bit" as a unit for an amount of bitcoins, or even more questionable derivatives such as "mbits", please reconsider.**
To address your question: Neither, both are incredible stupid. I'm sticking to `mBTC` and `μBTC`.

No, there is no need for two transactions, a single transaction with two outputs is sufficient to send each participant their final channel balance.

Advantages of being a big hub:  
• Short paths  
• Possibility to earn fees
Disadvantages of being a big hub:  
• Large frozen assets  
• Few paths actually increase reach  
• Huge target for hacking  
About using a big hub:  
• Users that only are connected to the hub have no privacy from the hub  
• They're completely at the mercy of the hub concerning fees
A bunch of smaller nodes with 3-4 connections each can easily route around large hubs if they ask too much fees, without making too long paths. I'm convinced that a successful Lightning Network would vastly increase the overall value of the Bitcoin system, and thus also increase the demand for blockchain transactions.

SegWit is part of a set of different proposals that are being worked on to improve scalability. It is neither the only capacity improvement, nor the only scaling improvement in the pipeline. 
* I see very little chance of Core developer consensus for a hard fork blocksize increase before the adoption of SegWit. The reasons have been sufficiently often elaborated for anyone to understand, as long as they are willing to assume it's not a conspiracy but said developers actually believe what they say. And with that I mean that the reader will be able to understand the position, even if they end up disagreeing with the sentiment.
* I see very good chances of further capacity improvements following SegWit, or being provided by other means should SegWit not activate.
* In the longterm I think it's extremely likely that there will also be hard fork blocksize increases, both because the potential negative impact of such an upgrade will be alleviated by changes in SegWit and other improvements, as well as it being a part of the scalability roadmap. However, a hard fork upgrade will become much less likely, if the community remains as torn as it currently is.

I don't believe that uncontentious hard forks are a breach in contract. However, I'm afraid that all hard forks are contentious if there are people that feel that "hard forks are a breach of contract".
It seems likely that contentious hard forks will never be possible without creating a forkcoin in the process, and therefore a hard fork should be opposed if there is a significant amount of opposition.
If you're worried about what Bitcoin's creator thought, IIRC he stated that Bitcoin's rules were essentially unchangeable after the network was started… how's that for a position on hard forks? Please come up with some sound arguments if you want to discuss in earnest. All these claims of people knowing what Satoshi would have wanted are getting really old.

LN payment channels are based on 2-of-2 multisignature transactions. One of the two keys is yours, and you're provided with a pre-image from your payment channel partner that allows you to unilaterally dissolve the payment channel.

3. In a populist attack, they manage to convince the community to give you a vote of no confidence and instead replace you with said team of a fraction the size without the track record of delivering improved Bitcoin software for years.
4. Would you  
a) give up your project's development culture, throw into the wind your quality desires, and submit yourself to the new team as your project leaders,  
b) double down and decide that since now your community no longer depends on a secure and well-considered development pace, you can make larger improvements quickly, so you use the chance to actually create a vastly improved version of Bitcoin by hard forking in the hard fork wish list,  
c) find another hobby/calling where your contributions are appreciated?
I'd hope that some developers would opt for b), but I think c) is much more likely than a). Personally, I'd consider Bitcoin failed at that point.

There were lots of business ideas around cheap blockspace back then. If entrepreneurs could have expected blockspace to be more abundant, more of them would have build their services around its availability. Last example that comes to mind is Dotcom's Mega Upload 2, which was supposed to use the blockchain for data anchoring but veered off when the realization set just how limited blockspace supply is.

Computers will never work, because you couldn't store all books' knowledge on a single computer when they were first invented.
Just because the plan is to activate Lightning while we have small blocks doesn't mean that a) we're going to take all global financial traffic to Lightning over night, nor that the activation of Lightning is the end of the evolution of Bitcoin's protocol.


Citation needed. Greg was the principal author of the Bitcoin Scaling roadmap which clearly states that blocksize will have to increase in the longterm.

It would be marvelous if Bitcoin transactions wouldn't cost anything. I'd love if blockspace would be unlimited. I agree that it would be nice if there were already an agreement about the further scaling roadmap.

SF SegWit has the root of the Witness in the coinbase transaction, because that way the SegWit enabled blocks are still compatible with previous versions of Bitcoin.
HF SegWit would put the Witness root in the Block header (like the transaction root), breaking all compatibility with previous versions of Bitcoin. New blocks would just look invalid to previous versions.
That would mean that every single node would have to upgrade to a SegWit HF enabled version before the HF activation or be forked off the network. Before that every SegWit enabled wallet would have to be updated to read the information from the new location.


While `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` is indeed a single variable, the change of the variable impacts other parts of what the nodes do. For example it is sensible to limit the number of sighash operations allowed in a block. The Bitcoin Classic patch had added limits to that end for example. Anyway, it's not as simple as just changing one value.


SegWit has been tested for more than half a year. It would be reckless to rework it now while it is being signaled for, and void most of the testing that was done. It's not sensible to slap ad hoc patches on software that manages more than $10G of value.

I think the problem is how we understand control: for me control is about who has authority on what happens to the balance. You appear to use control as a moniker of having it at your disposal for regular Bitcoin transactions. I never claimed the latter, in fact I stated a few levels up that they are indeed tied up. However, even tied up, nobody else has control over the balance.
I'm not the one downvoting you.

This is not correct. The quadratic scaling problem occurs with big transactions not bigger blocks. The concern is that bigger blocks would make it easier to include larger transactions.

Well, it is my perception that you may get both, but not at the same time. Right now, SegWit is available. A hard fork is not scheduled yet, because (as we have seen with SegWit), it's hard to predict when proposals will be sufficiently mature to be rolled out, and there is currently no consensus among Core developers to recommend such an upgrade to the community.
While BU and r\btcfork are proposing such protocol upgrades, I sincerely doubt that they will be adopted by the whole Bitcoin community.
This leaves few options:
* Settle for SegWit, which may be a step in the right direction, even if not everything wished for
* Protest SegWit to attempt forcing a hard fork blocksize increase (which frankly seems a long shot and somewhat ironic, if one is actually concerned with capacity)
* Fork without majority support to another protocol version.
Out of the three options, SegWit adoption appears the most beneficial to me.
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:14:40
I feel that this description is leaving out a bit of the important information of the circumstances of these proposals. This is how I remember it from the top of my head IIRC (probably not strictly in the correct order):
* Gavin Andresen proposed an immediate blocksize increase to 20mb. As he was asked to show his tests that such an increase would work on the network, it turned out that his proof of concept was napkin math, and that he had only accounted for download bandwidth and forgotten to account for upload bandwidth.
*  GA then proposed a blocksize increase to 8mb. He had talked to Chinese miners and as 8 is a lucky number (symbolizing riches) in Chinese culture, they liked 8mb for the proposal. He also suggested to double this every two years up to 8 GB in 20 years. It was shot down, because it seemed presumptuous to plan 20 years ahead, and because J. Toomim, the later Classic developer showed research that blocksizes greater than 4mb would probably create latency issues via the GFW.
* GA then proposed to the community to fork to Bitcoin-XT and to install Mike Hearn as benevolent dictator of Bitcoin-XT for life, because his proposal didn't find consensus among Bitcoin Core developers. He also started marketing directly to the Bitcoin community instead of seeking consensus with other developers through the BIP process.
* Just before the first Scaling Bitcoin conference Adam Back proposed a 2-4-8 approach, three doublings spaced out with one year in between each. GA rejected this as "absurdly small".
* The Scaling Roadmap was proposed as the result of Scaling Bitcoin Milan and Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong. The Core developers had come to the agreement of implementing SegWit first. Gavin Andresen did not attend.
* Gavin Andresen thinks SegWit is great, but not a solution to the immediate blockspace worries. After Mike Hearn's exit, GA proposes Bitcoin Classic sporting a 2mb blocksize and protection against too many sighash operations. His development team sported J. Toomim whose previous track record was afair solely the bandwidth research and running a mining pool, as well as one or two other people without notable contributions to Bitcoin before. Also very visible was Michael Toomim as a spokesman of the project that would brag about smoking weed while giving drunk interviews. Gavin declares that he will code the blocksize increase and then only advise the project, the other coding would be mostly left to the Bitcoin Classic developers. Bitcoin Classic would also only include the blocksize increase and then copy all other changes from Bitcoin Core, until activation. So, Classic essentially doesn't even have a development agenda beside the blocksize increase but tries to "fire the Core developers for not listening to the community", while rebasing on Core's work.
* Re: Hong Kong Meeting: The text clearly indicates that the present developers would implement a hardfork proposal and present it to the community. This is actually in the text of the agreement. Also, Antpool started signaling for Classic within weeks of the meeting. Luke did implement preliminary code for the hardfork by the way: 
So it seems to me that our memory of the events diverge slightly.
I used to also think that we need an immediate blocksize increase. I did read everything from Gavin religiously, and actually proof-read one of his blog articles for him when Bitcoin Classic was being formed. However, the more I read about the debate, the less convinced I was of Classic, and the more convinced I got that Bitcoin Core was on the right path.

They'd put it in the block header, which obviously isn't possible with a soft fork. However, the location of the witness root is such a minor point I assume you wanted to demonstrate that your thoughts on how SegWit "would be better and more cleanly implemented in a different way, but requiring a hard-fork" have not progressed far beyond the mere statement of that goal?
@_date: 2016-12-16 01:54:30
Your analogy doesn't fit because your file is not part of the data that is relayed between nodes while the witness data is.

I have contributed to Bitcoin Core, although not as much as I want to, yet.
What I mean is that unless it is an emergency, a hard fork should have at least a year of fallow. It would be prudent to have the code in at least two major versions before it is activated, so that there are as few as possible nodes forked off the network.
Activating a hard fork in December only starting the work now would be reckless.

Blockstream's people have actually implemented a previous version of SegWit as a hard fork and have multiple times stated that they consider the new approach to be better. According to [maaku7]( the only thing that they would change in a hard fork is the location of the witness root.
So please, I'm very curious for your source on Greg stating a hard fork version would be preferable when you get around to searching for it.

* **Full Node**: A node that fully enforces all rules of Bitcoin. It won't accept invalid blocks or transactions.
* **Archival Node**: A node that has a complete copy of the blockchain.
* **Pruned Node**: A node that doesn't have a complete copy of the blockchain.
* **Listening Node**: A node that allows incoming connections.

Sorry, but that is a lame excuse. Of course they don't know which transactions will be contained in the next pool, but they could estimate from their own mempool. E.g. if there are 10,000 transactions with a better fee rate, this transaction will probably take at least four more blocks to confirm.
Right now it seems that they have a hard-coded fee level, and that is just downright misleading as it doesn't reflect the current network demand in any way.
Even worse, their own estimator seems to misjudge appropriate fees, and many of their own transactions get stuck as well (at least there often are people asking about transactions sent from blockchain.info).

I don't understand what you mean. Of course it's an issue. All of the above problems are part of the bigger picture, as with every sufficiently complex discussion there are a multitude of facets to the different positions.
In my perception, it's mostly that a part of "the bitcoin community, those voting for bigger blogs" have been too busy chanting their demands and painting the opposition as pure evil as to make sufficient effort to understand the both sides of the argument. It's not like all of the above information wasn't made available.
For what it's worth, Lejitz is probably located on the other extreme of this discussion, but he does a very good job of explaining why there is next to no chance for a hard fork blocksize in the near future.
E.g. in my opinion it would be very beneficial if we managed to add a few more upgrades to Bitcoin before it becomes completely unchangeable. However, I agree that it will become ever harder to change Bitcoin the more adoption it has.

The trust levels required in Visa and LN are very dissimilar. Without further explanation "LN just based on trust pretty much like Visa did it a few decades ago - trust and then verify." just sounds false. I'll elaborate my perspective below, but feel free to explain how they are supposedly similar.
Assuming that LN will go live as it is currently being described by its developers, LN will require the following:
* Commiting of funds to a LN channel that can be quickly dissolved bilaterally, and unilaterally dissolved with a delay.
* Being online for payments to be negotiated on your payment channel
* Checking on your payment channel at least once per week to make sure your channel partner is not defrauding you by trying to resolve an old state of the channel. (Or your custom timeout window, if it's not one week.)
* Payments are practically instantly secured by updating the channel and settlement can be initiated whenever it is convenient for either user.
* All of the above is cryptographically secured and private. 
* *The only thing you trust in is that the other user doesn't try to defraud you (which would be to his own detriment if you check during the timeout period), and that the other user doesn't inconvenience you by delaying settlement.*
Visa requires:
* To have a bank account where your identity is known.
* To commit funds to your bank account
* That the payer doesn't try to revert their payment within the next three months.
* That both involved banks, Visa, and any observing authorities don't decide to intervene in the payment and actually transmit it.
* To use a card that features all information required to use it printed on the card. Or for online use, to put all your card's information into a web form…
* Payment is settled months after it was promised.

I've had coffee with two of the full-time core developers a few months ago (and met them again in Italy last month). One of them asked me how I could stand to spend so much time on reddit. I'm recounting this, because "how Core communicates" is a two-lane street. 
When well-known Core developers add a comment to something on reddit, they get showered with additional questions and comments. Some of those are less than constructive, and frequently they are confronted with the ever same accusations. Altogether, the Signal to Noise ratio on reddit is pretty low. Most of the developers appear to react to this by just discontinuing their visits to reddit, while others just "get more economically about the effort they put in their answers" (alright, let's call it "curt"). ;)
Unfortunately, either is detrimental to the conversation of the developers with the community. I've talked about communication with the community to several of them, but it's a real time investment to them, and not one that's fun or rewarding. I can completely understand both of their reactions. A few things happened this year that intermittenly improved communication, but I feel that it is already dropping off. :-/
Anyway, the point is. A lot of the information is there for those that read it up: There are some very good interviews with Epicenter and Bitcoin Magazine, there are the weekly meeting minutes, the mailing lists, IRC, and the discussions on Github. If we inform ourselves better about what we're talking about and make better use of their time when we talk, they'll be more inclined to have the conversation, and we'll be more effective at being heard.

Firstly, the rule set they propose will almost certainly end up dominated by the miners and thus will upset the delicate balance between different shareholder groups in Bitcoin, secondly the dynamic consensus rules introduce a second layer of the Byzantine general problem. 
The consensus system discovered by Nakamoto only provides a solution to achieve convergence of the blockchain in a _fixed set of rules_. Inevitably the rule setting process requires another solution, for which currently the BU proposal simply requires out-of-band agreement. The necessity of out-of-band agreement in combination with a strong position for the miners is rife for exploitation and has no guarantee to converge. Thus I strongly oppose this consensus disimprovement.
Other issues I have with BU:
- Flawed quality management
- Deliberate circumvention of established Bitcoin development community by marketing half-baked proposals directly to the community before peer-review
- Closed membership structure
- Lack of security mindset
- Support mainly derived from emotion rather than based on technical understanding
- Remaining fan-club utterly resistant to evidence approaching religious fervor

Maybe I misunderstood your proposal, but besides not being interested in Lottery at all, the problems with your proposal seem to be the following:
- You control the deposits before the draw, and there is nothing that stops you from running off with them.
- You know the number in advance, and there is nothing that stops you from entering the lottery with the correct number yourself.
You might be able fix the second issue by using the transactional data of the incoming transactions to the payment address to generate the winning numbers. (As you cannot predict those.) 
The first doesn't have a real solution: You might be able to build up trust by running this service for some time without incidences, but you'd still be able to run-off with the money once the pot gets big enough.
So... Nope, not interested.

Your coins are safe until you want to use them. Then you'll have to assess the situation: IF there are two persisting chains, you might want to doublespend them to yourself until they are split into two different addresses on the two chains, allowing yourself to send them independently on both chains.

BU is an existential risk. "Emergent consensus" undermines the key values of Bitcoin by disimproving the consensus system.
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:38:11
Here is what happens step by step:
**Regular transaction:**  
1. Alice sends to Bob.  
2. Bob sees an unconfirmed transaction. Bob can decide to assume that he will be paid, by taking the risk of accepting a zero-confirmation transaction.  
3. Transaction gets confirmed. Bob got paid.  
**Opt-in RBF transaction:**  
1. Alice sends to Bob.  
2. Bob sees an unconfirmed non-standard transaction that happens to have an RBF marker. Bob decides to wait for the first confirmation.  
3. Transaction gets confirmed. Bob got paid.
Unless it is your habit to accept non-standard transactions with zero-confirmation, you don't even have to change your habits.

The Halvening. 
The Halvening is scheduled at a specific block height to which we're just  ticking down waiting for no man's squabbles. After that letter from miners expressing abstinence from a pre-mature fork, I don't see Classic gaining 75% support anytime soon.

You present this as the only possible outcome, but what convinces you that it is? Have you considered other possible scenarios? 
Here's one: Multiple Core developers have stated that they are not interested in developing a Bitcoin that can be hijacked by a majority vote. They consider Bitcoin to be a failed experiment at that point. Let's assume that they are not the only people that feel like that. So, let's say when 75% of the mining power forks Bitcoin to Classic, 25% (4 million BTC) of the bitcoins on the Classic chain go up for sale. It could happen, because we don't know who holds which coins and what they support. How would that affect the price of the Classic coins? How does that affect miner revenue? Will they be able to pay their electricity? It may quickly become more profitable to return to Core, especially if their hashpower is a larger relative portion of the total.

The scenario is somewhat carried to the extremes, but I see where it's coming from.
Actually the solution is simple, though: 
2. The customer can just overwrite the payment with the same transaction as a non-RBF version.
3. Alternatively, the customer can overwrite it to send it back to himself, then pay with cash.
4. If he can't overwrite it in time, it's already confirmed and we're done anyway.
If a wallet doesn't enable the user to overwrite his own RBF transaction with standard options such as the two mentioned above, it shouldn't offer the functionality at all. It doesn't really make sense to be activated by default in wallets otherwise, if then. 
And to add my two satoshi: I used to also be excited about being able to pay in a brick and mortar store with Bitcoin. But, after having experienced it a few times, and having thought more on it – to be honest, it is not a great use-case for Bitcoin today. Especially in a walk-in customer scenario such as described by the scenario you linked, it should be implemented by relying on a payment processor, to pass issues as described on to the responsibility of the latter. As long as you have to rely on a confirmation to be sure the payment has arrived the potential wait or risk would just be a deal-breaker to me.
Bitcoin, as it is today, is much better suited for any scenarios that doesn't rely on point-of-sale situations, e.g. mail-order business, ticket sales, or settling invoices. The incentives for accepting Bitcoin might be different in countries that rely more on card payments, but here in Germany we mostly rely on cash for small payments anyway. If a shop comes up with the decision to accept Bitcoin by themselves, I'd be happy to use it there, but I've decided not to lobby for acceptance of Bitcoin payments in brick and mortar stores before Lightning Network or similar arrives.

If I understand correctly, the proposal is that you would deposit bitcoins with a miner and then they would open a payment channel with the coinbase transaction.
This has two obvious disadvantages that were not mentioned in your post:
- It requires trusting the miners.
- The channel would open an undetermined number of blocks later, as you'd not only wait for confirmation, but for one specific miner to find a block.

Hard forks are protocol replacements. If you're just going to replace the whole thing, why bother defining any rules in before?




I can't follow your train of thought. Can you put that in some sort of comprehensible phrases?




Yes, it keeps various parties honest. See e.g. the recent ASICBoost discovery, the previous double spending attacks by miners against online casinos, the transaction floods caused by Satoshi Dice, the blockchain rollback on Ethereum for the DAO…


You sure seem to be the right person to admonish lack of study… your whole comment reads as if you were drunk.  
VC is only a portion of the market. If we give up the key selling points of Bitcoin to quickly appease VC, we'll end up with something broken that is more inefficient than existing systems. SegWit is ready, and in short term will allow transaction capacity growth (e.g. BitGo is ready for SegWit and currently responsible for 16% of the transactions alone), approximately double the transaction capacity in the medium term, and provides us with a high capacity "minipayment" layer on top. We can revisit hard fork blocksize increases once we've exhausted the low-hanging fruits.


If you've already understood that BU is DOA, why do you bother asking for arguments against it?
@_date: 2016-02-23 20:59:58
You can repeat that as often as you want, it is still a misrepresentation.   
Opt-In RBF: There's a BIG FAT LABEL on the transaction that says "NOT FINAL". And then people like you say "Oh my gawd, it's so terrible, it could be changed before it is confirmed." **That's the whole point of that type of transaction.** It's HIGHLY visible that the transaction may be replaced. It only applies to transactions that are labeled thusly. You get a warning in your wallet that it is a **non-standard transaction**. You then do not accept it without confirmation. What's the problem?
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:13:15
Ah, now I get my mistake. I thought you meant that your own deposit was $100, but you meant that the total value of the payment channel was $100.

@_date: 2017-04-01 11:04:40


Yes, because no hard fork precedent would have been set, and no, because SegWit actually makes it easier by enabling us to increase capacity with extension blocks.


SegWit transactions are a bit larger but if we hit the maximum 3.7mb blocks, it's because we're facilitating transactions that would require significantly more than 2mb in the old format.

I agree with your general idea, but you're off by about one magnitude with your "1 minute". If I understand Pieter Wuille correctly here, [regular blocks take less than five seconds to relay and verify]( with current Bitcoin client software. The exception are [attack-blocks]( specifically crafted to slow down verification.
Due to the optimizations of the last few years, most Core contributors feel that 2MB blocks would be fine now, if they are combined with prohibition on attack blocks such as the reduced complexity of transaction verification with SegWit transactions.

A chain fork is executed by mining power, but there are four other pillars in the Bitcoin community: Investors, Users, Developers, and Service providers.
If a noteworthy portion of any other pillar is in opposition to the hardfork, the hardfork may become much messier than the smooth experience that is described e.g. in [Minority Branches by Gavin]( 
**Developers:**  
There definitely is **noteworthy opposition** among developers. Developers are highly visible in the community and have a strong influence on the stance of other community pillars.  
*Results of opposition:* Debate; Alienation of Bitcoin developers; Potential switch of PoW algorithm on Minority Chain.
**Investors:**  
Very hard to measure, because it's not necessarily in the interest of whales to advertise their Bitcoin investment. Some may see the hardfork as a way to develop their investment, others might be [risk averse]( to protect their investment. **Mixed bag at best.**   
*Result of opposition:* [Hard Fork Missile Crisis](
**Service providers:**  
Have a need to grow the utility of the Bitcoin network. Might have VC money breathing down their neck. Have to invest development effort, and need to prepare how to deal with a potential permanent hard fork. Most still noncommital, some vocal exceptions.  
*Result of opposition:* High visibility in community, strong influence on user opinion, strong influence on utility of hard fork through their support.
**Users:**  
Interested in cheap and fast transactions, not overly financially invested into Bitcoin therefore not as risk averse. Most likely to be out of touch with the latest developments. Various interests and convictions. Highest mobility to shift support. **Mixed bag at best.**  
*Result of opposition:* Majority chain may be considered invalid by majority of users, forcing other pillars to shift their stance.
**I remain baffled why "mining power" or "number of nodes" are supposed to be a good indicator for the level of support in other areas of the community.** Happy for feedback and improvement suggestions on the above analysis.

This is not accurate.  
LN only works when built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. That's because LN transactions are delayed Bitcoin transactions, which, if they get replaced by an updated version never have to be written to the Bitcoin blockchain. LN can be resolved back on the Bitcoin blockchain any time by any of the involved parties though. If that mechanism doesn't exist, there is no need for anyone to stay honest in LN.
Since regular transactions and LN transactions have different trade-offs, an equilibrium will be found between the two. Likely blockchain transactions will be more expensive, more private, but forever written in the blockchain, while LN transactions will be instantaneous, cheaper, and only the last balance written to the blockchain, but your counter-party for the LN payment channel can track your balance. Meanwhile, LN could scale greatly, because only the parties participating in a payment need to receive the transactions, while this is not the case for the regular transactions.
LN is not a private network. It is open-source and was proposed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja. Blockstream is just donating one developer's time to it's development because they think it's the best way forward. Once it will be activated, anyone will be able to offer their liquidity for payment channels, and nobody will be able to keep it private or control it.

About the aliasing problem: 


Couldn't I just open a second payment channel and send money to my first channel?  That way I wouldn't have to close the first channel, saving a transaction on the main network. Having at least two channels open would be convenient anyway, because it would enable me to withdraw bitcoins to the main-net without closing all my channels on Lightning.
Or is this just a misunderstanding due to the analogies?
@_date: 2016-02-20 09:34:01
I mostly agree, but it is hard for the miners to gauge the actual position of the other pillars. i.e. to discern loud supporters vs actual level of support.


But a hardfork that may activate in less than two months in light of unclear levels of support is provident? Short term crisis management seems appropriate. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 08:50:52


The block reward will still incentivize mining just as before. As to transaction fees, there will always be people that prefer putting their transactions on the main chain directly. This would encompass e.g. funding and defunding of LN payment channels, large one time transactions, or transactions from people that don't want to establish a payment channel with a hub for privacy reasons. Other than now where full blocks may cause a fee event, because transactions have no where else to go, one would expect an equilibrium to establish itself between main chain transactions and LN transactions as some transaction move to LN to evade fee pressure. If there will be too much room in the blocks left (which seems doubtful), some LN usage may swing back to the main net, or other use cases will  compete and pay for that room, e.g. proof of existence.


Actually, **Lightning Transactions are confirmed by the overall network**, just not immediately. They get aggregated until one party of a payment channel wants to withdraw their money from the channel. Each party has that option at all times by publishing the channel's last "balance sheet" as a transaction to the Bitcoin network.  
Off-chain usually refers to in-house transfers, where e.g. two users on Changetip or Coinbase send money from one to the other. The facilitating company just updates their internal spreadsheet to shift balances. On the other hand, LN is just an efficient way to delay on-chain transactions to get the most use out of them. To classify LN as off-chain is not correct.

BU had three bugs this year already, after boastfully announcing that they have advanced enough to call it version 1.0. In reality, they have diverged so far from upstream that they can't even cherry pick useful patches from Core anymore. Core has added four thousand commits since BU branched off. 
Except for miners there are practically no big named companies supporting the proposal, in fact numerous exchanges have announced that it will not be listed in its current form because it doesn't have wipe-out or replay protection. Besides, miners can't force a hard fork by themselves, because if they start mining larger BU blocks that merely means that they are producing invalid blocks according to about 85% of the nodes. Loads of projects have integrated SegWit and there is a ton of upgrades in the pipeline that either depend on SegWit or would benefit immensely. All these developers that have invested time into such projects will try to get something for their investment eventually.
I've seen three or four polls, two of them initiated by BU supporters, and all of them had less than 15% support for BU.
BU is DOA, and more people will realize it as this stalemate drags on. SegWit will activate with or against the miners.

LN transactions are native Bitcoin multisig transactions where each side of the payment channel hands the other a transaction they signed and the counterparty can unilaterally countersign to activate.
Sidechains rely on their own blockchain that is coupled to the Bitcoin blockchain via a two-way peg.

Winning means that your blocks are part of the longest chain. If some minority of the miners is certain that the hard fork will be aborted, e.g. there is miner support, but they know that the users won't accept it, they would not go along. 
As an example, if 75% of the miners forked to change the mining reward, and 25% of the miners think that it'll fail, they'd remain on the old fork. They would continue to find about the same amount of blocks as before, slowing down the block interval to ~40 minutes until the difficulty resets. But, their block rewards will later be spendable, while those of the forkers would not, because nobody in the community buys them.

No, Litecoin has already reached more than 6048 blocks signaling readiness in period 6 (this period), so it will switch to `LOCKED_IN` for period 7, and `ACTIVE` in period 8. While it is recommended to continue signaling in `LOCKED_IN` it has no influence on the activation anymore. `LOCKED_IN` merely triggers warnings on node software in case the upgrade is unknown to the node, i.e. the node is not ready.

**RE: 1. Prioritizing SegWit before a block size increase would be a mistake**


The 2MB HF is a *capacity increase*. It does **nothing** for scalability.  
SegWit is a *scalability improvement* which happens to also increase capacity although less than 2MB blocks.


Classic limits the effect of those scalability issues by adding more arbitrary limits to the code. SegWit solves them by reducing the complexity class of those transaction verifications.
**RE: 2. July 2017 is too far away to raise the block size**

What **if** the number of transactions doesn't double? What **if** LN or other payment channel implementations such as 21's get finished? What **if** we worry and find a solution next year **if** we actually get capacity problems?

**RE: Conclusion**


It might work technically, but it doesn't have the [support to be implemented safely]( Hence, **it does not work**.








The price is so low because people are afraid that Bitcoin (yes, capital B) will be hijacked by a popular majority and turned into a mob ruled shitcoin instead of one progressing through the "[data-driven, technical consensus development process]( The price went down with the announcement of Classic. The price went up with the announcement of the Roundtable agreement. Read between the lines.
While I'm happy for people thinking laterally and challenging prevailing opinions because it helps to reevaluate whether the project is on the right path, it's time to get off a horse when it's dead. This should be obvious to anyone that followed the technical arguments of both proposals and the sentiment in the community as a whole. To launch the blocksize debate into another round is a nuisance and will solely result in additional waste of manpower. Manpower that could instead be working on actually increasing **Scalability** instead of just capacity.  
Please feel free to keep Classic on ice IF it ever becomes obvious that other options do not serve. Hyping Classic now, again, before even the SegWit launch should have happened is detrimental. Alternatively, at least put your money where your mouth is by funding some mining and development.

* You wouldn't have a channel directly for one vendor, but rather with a hub. If you only want to do one transaction, it would indeed be more efficient to send it directly.
* They can't, when you both sign the new agreement, each on gives the other a "claim everything" transaction that builds on the previous superseded receipt. Since that transaction only becomes valid when the counterparty tries to defraud you, it can be distributed freely to the whole network. Other nodes are incentivized to keep it by getting a small bounty if they successfully stop the counterparty from defrauding you.
* Hubs shouldn't be interested in closing payment channels prematurely, as they earn money by providing that payment channel to you (they get a small fee every time you route a payment through them). Hubs that close payment channels prematurely will get a bad reputation and lose customers.
* Payment channel partners cannot take your money.

LN has different trade-offs than the main chain.  
**Advantages:**  
* Instant confirmation
* Less main chain traffic
* Only last balance permanently recorded to blockchain
* (Once Onion routing works) payment channel partner can't tell if you are destination or man in the middle for transaction
* Address remains the same for the duration of the payment channel's existence
* Payment channel partner can keep track of the changes in your balance with them
* Money has to be withdrawn from LN before it can be sent to address that is not connected to LN
**Just different:**
* Every hop through the payment channel routing costs a fee (although probably smaller than fees now)

Backing up the blockchain data more than once is pretty unnecessary. I can understand one backup, then you can just copy that over and don't have to download and re-verify the whole chain, but making a backup of the blockchain every month seems a waste of diskspace. If you lose both the currently used copy and the backup, it'll only cost you a couple of days to download the blockchain data again. It's redundantly available by its very design.
So, just update your backup of that set of data once a month instead of saving the whole thing evrey month.

@_date: 2016-02-23 21:06:47
Yes, you still need the whole blockchain to start a fresh full node. (Or you could copy the data from a pruned node that you trust.)
  
However, pruning nodes keep blocks that are relevant to their own wallet (e.g. because of transactions that were relevant to their wallet), and it seems very likely that there will always be some people that want to keep the full blockchain, e.g. because their business depends on it, eventually you can get paid to upload very old blocks, or they just want to.
Perhaps you'll also be able to download old bootstraps from a server or via bittorrent.

was talking about unconfirmed transactions identifying them as "non-reversible transactions". Unconfirmed transactions were never reliable in that way, in fact his holiness Satoshi suggested waiting for six transactions. Nothing about the properties of regular transactions changes through Opt-In RBF, as insinuates.  
Now, people have been assessing the risks of accepting zero confirmation transactions at least [since 2011]( The situation is the same as before: For a regular customer paying two bucks for a cup of coffee, you'll probably just let him have his coffee. Even if one or two transactions in a hundred go afoul you're saving money over CC. If the transaction doesn't go through, you'll tell him next time to pay up, or don't accept Bitcoin from him anymore. If it starts happening all the time, you stop accepting Bitcoin.  
I agree that the risk assessment of accepting RBF-labelled transactions without confirmations probably tends toward "wait for one confirmation". So, people will have to learn when it is appropriate to use them and when not. Paying at a Brick and Mortar store is probably a use case where you just put in a sufficient fee in the first place and don't use RBF. Sending money that can arrive tomorrow, send it with RBF and a low fee. If it gets picked up, great. If not, add more fee a little later.
Besides, you might be interested in reading Peter Todd's [research  on whether wallets are ready for RBF]( TL;DR: Payment processors are ready. Wallets are terrible with regular doublespends, no need to even use RBF on them. Zero-confirmation transactions are not safe. (It's still a good read.)
To be honest, payments in brick and mortar stores were never a particularly strong use-case for Bitcoin. Sure, it's cool when a shop does it, but after seeing it in action once or twice, I've stopped advertising it. With the emergence of something like Lightning Network, Bitcoin can and will be a great payment system for instant payments.
Edit: Added information about Peter Todd's "Are wallets ready for Opt-In-RBF".

That doesn't sound right.    
1) The occurrence of two competing blocks is a rare event which only happens . 2) Even a second of difference in discovery quickly is an unsurmountable advantage, as the successful miner pushes out the `inv` message for the block immediately. 3) Since we have headers first and compact blocks now, propagation delay is even less of an issue in comparison to validation delay. 4) The source you quote states that propagation delays affect larger miners' stale rates less than smaller miners'.
Perhaps I'm missing something here, could you explain what this proportional relationship would derive from?

Bitcoin would be usable from Mars but confirmations would suffer an additional latency of 4-24 minutes. Unconfirmed transactions should not be trusted at all.
Probably it would make more sense to have a sidechain and/or Lightning Network specific to Mars.

Larger blocks take longer to propagate and longer to validate. Other miners can only start working on a (non-empty) succeeding block once they've validated the current. Larger blocks therefore lead to a greater advantage for the authoring miner at finding also the next block.
Additionally, it is trivial to fill blocks of any size, therefore a sufficiently large mining-conglomerate could easily fill up blocks to increase blocksize and thus extend their advantage over the competition.

Just sounds a bit too optimistic. There are lots of problems to solve yet. Routing is a tough one as all information is transient and multi-dimensional: capacity of each channel changes with each payment, channel fees can be changed at will by each owner, lightning nodes drop in and out…
Then, SegWit will only activate at the earliest ~4 weeks after the activation code is delivered with 0.13.1, which will probably take another two or three weeks at least. So, SegWit can't be active before end of October. Might have another row with the miners over them requiring code for a blocksize increase before activating SegWit. It could be the end of the year until 95% of the mining power signals readiness.

Criticism: An upvote appears to cost 1 μBTC, or 100 satoshis. If you're willing to pay the same cost again in transaction fees, you'd be able to pay roughly ~3 satoshi per byte (100 satoshi/34 bytes for a P2PKH-transaction output).
With a fee that low, you'd currently wait at least four blocks, likely around 20 or more. To achieve a confirmation in the next few blocks, you'd need a fee at least ten times greater.
Anyway, that's when you're performing a transaction already and are only adding a second output to make the upvote. If you perfom a transaction just for the upvote, you'd have a minimum of 10+147+34 = 191 bytes.
Also, a 1 μBTC output is below the dust-limit, so the transaction would be non-standard.
→ Your concept doesn't work on basis of transactions, because it will be infeasible to make the required amount of transactions at cost. It could perhaps work on basis of a centralized service similar to a tipbot, with micropayment channels or on LN.

Zero confirmation largely depends on nodes and miners adhering to the First-Seen principle. However, this is not something that can be enforced as it's up to the owner. Especially, miners have an economic incentive not to adhere to the First-seen principle when they see a double-spend with a larger fee.
Therefore, zero-confirmation transactions are just unconfirmed transactions. Promises to pay that have not been proven yet.
The game theory is broken for First-seen and it will not survive in the long run.

No, any extra margin in surpassing the difficulty target doesn't count and you've already told the reason: It could too easily be gamed, e.g. by speculating that you'd be able to replace the current chain-tip if you had found a very low hash.

Both blocks (`A1` and `B1`) will be at the same height and pointing at the same predecessor block‚ `0`. Therefore, only one of them can be in the longest valid chain.
However, as they are found at the same time, they have been propagated through the network and roughly half the network thinks `A1` is the chain-tip, and the other half thinks it's `B1`. The nodes learn about the other eventually, but ignore it, because they'll stick with the first-seen until they get shown a longer chain.
From the perspective of the `A1`-chain it is irrelevant which transactions were confirmed in `B1`, because `B1` is an invalid block from the `A1`-chain's perspective. All transactions not confirmed in `A1` or previously are unconfirmed and available for succeeding blocks. (Same vice versa.)
Soonish, the next block will be found. It must either build on `A1` or on `B1`. Let's say the new block is `A2` and extends the chain with `A1`.  
`A2` is at a greater height than `B1`, so the chain with `A1 + A2` is longer. As nodes that previously had `B1` at the chain-tip hear about `A2`, they will also reorganize to the `A2` chain. `B1` becomes an *extinct block*.
In response to the other answers here: *Orphaned block* is a misleading term for these abandoned chain-tips, because their ancestry is available, but they won't have descendants.  
Rather, *orphan blocks* are blocks that a node receives during synchronization before the full ancestry of the block is known to the node. The node will keep that block in memory and request peers to fill in the gap in the history.

The difficulty is the same for both blocks, because the difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks. To have differing difficulties in two chain-tips you need a chainfork of at least two blocks depth, where the first is the last block before the difficulty retarget, and the second is the first in the new difficulty section. 
Therefore, the difficulty cannot be the tie-breaker here.

My example from above works such:
                A1 → A2 → A3…
    -1 → 0 → 
                B1
`B1`'s predecessor is `0`, so it's not an *orphan*, i.e. it's not without parents. It is a valid part of the blockchain, but it will never have any children and therefore won't be part of the **longest valid chain**. So, it's chain-tip is *extincted*.   
Transactions that were confirmed by it are orphaned, because they didn't get confirmed in the longest chain –until they get picked up by a block in the longest chain, which most noticeably will never happen to the coinbase transaction.   
As long as some nodes think that `B1` is the chain-tip, it's gonna get propagated by those nodes. As soon as `A2` is discovered and the blockchain fork resolves to the benefit of `0→A1→A2` instead of `0→B1`, nodes that have heard about `A2` will no longer consider `B1` a valid block and will not propagate it.

@_date: 2016-09-17 23:28:07
Sorry, I was missing part of a sentence there.
Mining is a Poisson process, and the chance to find two blocks in twelve seconds in a perfect network would be expected to be `(e^(-0.02)*(0.02)^2)/(2!) = 0.02%`. According to Blockchain.info it appears to be actually about one every three days. Even if it where two or three per day as you suggest, it would only affect the "stale rates" of these two miners that were in competition. 




That's three year old data and even with a very conservative cut-off of 600 seconds block time difference, there are only 15 stale blocks per retarget…
Also, we have compact blocks and header first propagation by now, and all miners are producing full blocks.


We were talking about the advantage of larger miners when you stated that stale rates are proportional to blocksize.  
If anything they would be proportional to blocksize difference. But since transaction fees are now about 2.5% of a block reward, and stale blocks occur every few days, you gain more by creating full blocks than by optimizing for stale rate.
I maintain that there is no reason to believe that the blockchain forks and resulting stale block are anywhere near as influential as the advantage of the head start of starting mining on your own block, while others are stuck validating it first.

I have some beef with your survey:
- You don't define what you group in "virtual currency". The term virtual currency may also apply to services such as Frequent Flyer Miles, AmazonCoins, or PayPal balance. It is more common to use "Cryptocurrencies" to refer to blockchain based systems and alternative approaches such as Ripple. Anyway, you should probably specify terminology somewhere.
- In Question 9 you ask what percentage people expect virtual currencies to account for. I sincerely doubt that people have any insight into the total, nor is it possible to distinguish cross border transfers from other transactions in Cryptocurrencies.
- In Question 12 you ask whether "Do you expect the Government[...]". Which Government? Mine, yours, governments in general?
- Question 13: " Do you expect Governments will take a practical view on Bitcoin and minimise user registration with identity checks to be limited to original purchase of Bitcoin with fiat currency?" Don't know how that would be minimal. Also that cannot be enforced, because I could acquire Bitcoin from an individual or get paid with them. This question doesn't make sense to me.
- Question 15: " If an organisation were to introduce acceptance of virtual currencies, select which of the following risk profiles you would consider best?" That obviously depends on what kind of organization, what relative amount of turnover happens in Bitcoin, and what stake the organization has in Bitcoin. The answer options don't reflect useful choices.
- Question 16: Virtual currencies are not anonymous. They are pseudonymous and may be private. "Low transaction costs" and "Low cost for small transactions" seem to be overlap.
- Question 17: Volatility of Exchange Rate may well be considered an advantage by users that trade currencies.
- Question 18: This has way too many lines, and is missing the most important factor: The technical capability of "virtual currencies" to actually cater to a much larger usage. Also, there are very secure methods of storing Bitcoin already, the security deficiencies are introduced mostly by users. 
I felt that seven choices for the level of importance was too much in many questions. You should probably revise your survey some more, and perhaps consult someone with experience in crafting surveys to get some more input.

Right, I didn't consider that the upload rather would be the bottleneck. Also good point about the pre-verification not being repeated. If it wouldn't match the longest chain on the network once you go live, you'd notice anyway, I guess.
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:33:39
Bitcoins are always sent from the address that they were received at. Therefore, there is no such thing as a "send from" address.
However, it does create a new address: If there is change left from the transaction inputs, the change gets send to a previously unused address from your address pool. The address pool is then replenished to always have 100 unused addresses in the backhand.

I was unaware that there was a standing definition now, I learned something new. :) 
I might still mention that this definition includes e.g. Frequent Flyer Miles and demarcate it in the survey, or make its first appearance a link to the definition. There has been a big jumble of people using Virtual Currency, Digital Currency, Digital Cash, and Cryptocurrency to a varying degree of interchangeableness in the past years, so I'm probably not the only one that didn't know about the exact definition of "Virtual Currency".


The thing is that people are incredible bad at guessing small percentages of large figures. I'm reminded of this article titled [The 1% fallacy]( I don't have a good idea how to fix that question, though.

It's the verification of the blocks that takes so long. All inputs and the script of each transaction need to be checked. Since there are more transactions in the blocks now, and the UTXO database has doubled, this takes more time. Download should not be the bottleneck since version 0.10.x, because block headers and transactions are now downloaded separately, allowing you to verify blocks out of order as long as the headers are already there.

Exactly. Basically, the miners are pushed in a situation where they have no information to decide how not to lose money. As soon as they get on a minority fork of a blocksize caused fork they'll lose money.
Now, either that would mean that the majority hashpower dictates the new blocksize, or that nobody ever increases the blocksize or that everyone just ends up accepting any size to not force the conflict.

@_date: 2016-10-25 16:10:46
Maybe I'm missing something, but it's my understanding that at least a portion of the security concerns for hardforks stem from the difficulty to measure the readiness of the **nodes**.
As far as I can tell, this proposal does nothing to mitigate the risk of leaving **nodes** on the obsoleted minority chaintip. This risk is why it is proposed for hardforks to be added to the code one year before their activation, so that there is a great likelihood no nodes become pushed off the network into by the fork.
Miners are fairly easy to reach, they must be constantly monitoring the state of their operation anyway to avoid losing money.
Besides, is it just me, or is it absurd to halve capacity for a whole month, just to synchronize miners? Wouldn't it be viable to just reject blocks that don't signal readiness for the hardfork for some time-frame before the hardfork?
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:35:51
Competing blocks occur about once every two to three days. 
That's once every 300-450 blocks. Look up the statistics if you don't believe me.
Miners communicate via compressed blocks. Transaction information has been shared before the block is found. I.e. with compact blocks a miner sends less than 20kB to announce a new 1MB block. 
The propagation delay of a few more kB is not even on the same plane of relevance as being able to induce other miners not to mine on your blocks, or to force the other miners to spend more time to validate your block.
@_date: 2016-10-23 17:15:40
I've seen many other people beside Greg address some of the talking points in r\btc. However, at some point it becomes clear that there are some actors there that are not interested in an honest debate where the disputants consider the others' point of view: 
* Repeated evidence that widely propagated conspiracy theories are baseless have made no dent in the frequency of their repetition.
* Technical arguments for the choices that were made are discounted in face of oversimplified talking points.
* Some are not even willing anymore to entertain the notion that Core contributors disagreeing with their opinion honestly believe in what they say.
* Discussion is seriously hampered by comments being downvoted for deviating thinking, or even for their poster rather than the content.
* There is no respect for your time: When people step up to address what their accused of, they will be badgered by endless repetitions of the same points, although they have been answered before (often even in the same thread).
At some point, it just seems like a waste of time trying to improve communication in an arena that is not interested in open discussion. Everything has been said more than enough times.
Edit: That's not to say that there are not some interesting arguments also being talked about in r\btc. I've read quite a few thoughtful comments there. It's just that the signal to noise ratio is pretty bad, and the tone of a good portion of the posts there is pretty accusatory if not outright hostile.

Now, certainly we could have useless discussions about SegWit being later than scheduled or what point in time was meant by "release of SegWit".

Yes, bigger blocks cause propagation delays, but propagation delays only have an influence when there is another block to compete with. Also, propagation delays are much less an issue with compressed blocks.
Forcing a 10% reduction of competition or forcing them to accept your blocksize seems much more an advantage than the propagation delay.

I was trying to point out that the statement Mark made above shouldn't come as a surprise but was even included in the document that you cite.
It appears that the whole HK business was a disaster: From what I gather, SegWit development was just barely starting out and there was no way to accurately estimate the development time, there were misunderstandings about what each side was getting out of the agreement, some issues with language barriers, one side couldn't/shouldn't have promised more than their personal effort, and members of the other side started mining Classic blocks just a little later. And, last but not least, it resulted in little more than a cease fire instead of a peace treaty. 
Altogether, I'm not sure whether the agreement is even still in effect anymore, but I'd still be happy if a hardfork pull request would be submitted for review after SegWit.
Regarding ViaBTC: I have read it, but my perception is different, so I disagree with the statements conclusions.  
For one, I feel that giving miners the power to dictate the block size fundamentally breaks the game theory of Bitcoin. Secondly, unless we're assuming operation under BU's paradigm, the ViaBTC overstates the miners' power. It is my perception that if the miners try a power grab, they'll either lose the trust of the majority of the Bitcoin community (mining invalid blocks is not providing security) and destroy their investment as the community moves to fire them, or if a sufficient large portion of the community moves with the miners, Bitcoin will lose the majority of the developers that have brought Bitcoin this far.  
But really, who knows. The whole topic has been discussed to no end, and frankly, I'm sick of it.

FTFY: 


Good question!
1. Hardforks require every node and miner to upgrade at the same time or be forked off the network. Softforks only require miners to switch before activation, the rest of the network can adopt at their convenience. 
2. Miner readiness can be measured, while network readiness is hard to measure. This is why hardforks require a long activation period to make sure a big part of the network is ready, while softforks can be activated quicker.
2. Successful softforks cause a converging network. Hardforks are likely to produce a lasting chainfork with a new forkcoin created.
2. SegWit has been tested on several TestNets for the better part of a year now, including the activation process. Hardfork to 2 MB can not be tested in advance because the risks stem from social issues such as the level of support it has after activation.
3. SegWit actually solves issues like transaction malleability and quadratic transaction verification complexity, while the HF introduces new magic numbers to curb the symptoms.
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:02:45
1) Extra space for certain transactions leaves more space for other transactions.
2) Lightning is something else than SegWit. But, if you're going to complain that Lightning is taking fees from the blockchain, shouldn't you be happy that it also diminishes blockchain space demand and makes transactions there cheaper? If you don't expect it to reduce blockchain demand, then certainly it would also be unreasonable that the fees for miners would decrease, especially when the value of Lightning related transactions is likely to be higher to their user thus they should be willing to pay a premium.
So… I don't really follow your argument, could you please elaborate?

It was my [previous understanding]( that ASICBOOST relied on a partial collision in the last sixteen bytes of the blockheader.
 The last sixteen bytes of the block header are composed of the
*    last four bytes of the Merkle root of the transactions
*    the time-stamp
*    the difficulty statement
*    the nonce.
The problem for ASICBOOST is that SegWit requires a commitment to all transactions in the block in an `OP_OUT` of the coinbase, thus changing the coinbase with every transaction that is changed in the block and making it much more expensive to find such partial collisions. I don't see how this would be impacted by signaling on another bit.

Usually, if the miner majority would unilaterally decide to increase the blocksize, they'd have to sell the community and other miners on it. Checks and balances. Instead we get a system where the majority of the hash power gets to dictate the blocksize, first co-opting the remaining hash power and subsequently thereby forcing the community to follow.
If you don't see how that's a problem we've probably reached the point where it makes sense to agree to disagree.

Frankly, signaling a version that you're not running is maybe even worse: Imagine that the hardfork activated right at 75% and it turns out that only 50-60% was actually running the forking version the rest just signaling it. The assumptions about the network's duration on convergence to the forked version would then be untenable. Miners have signaled versions they've not enforced before.




Sorry, it seems pretty natural that when someone points out an article they want you to comment on the content. Otherwise, what would I say. "Yeah, I've read it."?


That makes no sense to me: If blockspace supply is higher than demand, it'll be cheaper to transact directly on the chain and some of the lightning usage might just stay on chain. Also, other uses such as proof-of-existence will eat up demand. So, even with Lightning, blocks should remain pretty full. On the other hand, if Lightning gets lots of traction, there will be demand for opening and closing LN channels. Since the channels bundle a lot of economic activity, such transactions have a higher fee tolerance than low-value transactions. It seems that LN usage would create a new source of blockspace demand, and there'd be some sort of balance between pressure off the chain to lightning vs unique possibilities, security and convenience of on-chain payments. Actually, I expect Lightning rather to raise the block fees than reduce them.




Okay. There are different roles in Bitcoin that keep each other in check. By extending their role from being paid to provide security into dictating development direction and network throughput, miners would significantly increase their influence. If "power grab" is the wrong term for that, fine.  
I don't get how you can think that "bitcoin is a powerless system". Sure, power is distributed differently than in other groups, but it's not like individuals and entities don't have influence on it. There are clear differences in the attention things get said by e.g. Roger Ver or me. Also, the ViaBTC statement already shows that, doesn't it?  


So, they propose to change the consensus mechanism to give themselves more influence, but on the other hand this fits perfectly into the consensus mechanism?

Which version of LN? There are multiple implementations that are interoperable, but behave differently in the way e.g. they open payment channels. For example, I would not be operating a Lightning wallet with a single outbound payment channel. That way you have a significantly reduced financial privacy, as the server knows you are start (or end) of every payment he processes for you.
It seems that you are completely convinced that everyone must go through some sort of "hub". I don't understand why.  
If every LN user just opened up four random channels, you'd get a great mesh network almost immediately. From what I understood, that's what Rusty is working on at least. (I had breakfast with him in Milan earlier this month.) Maybe that vision doesn't come to pass, but that's what I have been told is the goal.

Two points: 1. The Communication got much better and the Slack appeared months before Armstrong wrote that.
2. If they feel excluded by IRC or the mailing list, it's by their own choice, because you can actually just read and post in either, I've done so myself. I'm pretty sure that e.g. Charlie Lee is actively participating there.


Ethereum is just the currently new exciting thing. It still feels like a lot is happening there, because the dust hasn't settled yet. ETH will have even worse scaling problems, once it actually gets used. It's development is even more centralized than Bitcoin's by the way with Vitalik's role as a benevolent dictator.


Have you ever looked at the composition of the Bitcoin Core developers? There are dozens of people from different companies or privately contributing. Sure, Blockstream does finance a bunch of the full-time developers, but it's rather an open collaboration by little groups and individuals than a closed team. That's also why communication is so hard: There weren't any elected team leaders or speakers to interface with the community, just some individuals that blogged or addressed the community in their own name. I believe they now have a weekly communications meeting.

1. Let's assume I'm A Very Large Mining Pool (AVLMP) and have 30% of the hashrate.
2. Everyone is mining 1MB blocks.
3. There are several MB unconfirmed transactions in the mempool.
4. I publish a 5MB block.
5.  a) 10% of the miners ignore my block, because it is too big. They don't know that they are the minority but think they're in the majority. They'll only find out when other blocks also build on my 5MB block.
 b) I now have effectively 33% percent of the remaining 90% of the mining power mining my blockchain instead of 30% until the 10% catch on.
 c) Meanwhile, my 5MB block is relayed with less than 100kB data transferred. Latency is not the issue, the probability for two blocks to appear within the hundredths of a second that is required to send 100kB between the directly connected miner nodes is minuscule. Then, if it's really a clear split I'm only affected in ~50% of the cases that another miner finds the next block, so only in 35% of the cases as I'm providing 30% of the mining power. I'd say less than 0.1% chance of my block going stale.
 d) However, the other miners take 2.5 seconds instead of 0.5 seconds to verify my larger block. At 600 seconds per block, this gives me an advantage of 0.33% more revenue.

Why do you conflate "not as the first thing" with "never" in regard of blocksize increases? Literally nobody thinks that 1mb+segwit is the end of the road. If any one made you believe that you should check for evidence on that.
SegWit is a real blocksize increase, ready and awaiting activation for half a year by now. Let's activate it, study its impact and then see what we should do next. Even disregarding the danger of a network split brought on by a hardfork at this point in time, a large number of nodes would currently be unable to keep up with the network at more than 4mb. Also, it would send the wrong signal to the market, implying that blockspace is cheap and available, which it is not – even if we could supply slightly more right now.
Fixing the price of transactions and trying to bend the technical reality of the system to that is putting the cart in front of the horse.

No, bit 4 is the version bit being used to signal readiness for the proposal. SegWit remains untouched except for that and is activated as a SF. Unfortunately, changing the version bit fucks with everything in SegWit, as all is built around what bit is being signalled on, all the P2P components, the network service flag, the witness-tx, block mesages, compact blocks, etc. Also, it would be incompatible with the current SegWit activation process, so the ongoing activation period would also have to be handled by the new code

Don't get me wrong, that would definitely be hard to implement, but probably not harder than a blocksize increase.


The Fed just inflated Bitcoin's value by magnitudes, how would you classify that as a crash? As I said, 10,000 bitcoins (less than 0.1% of what's currently in circulation) would still give us one trillion units to transact with. Each unit magnitudes more valuable than before the cornering attempt. One trillion units would go a long way to support an economy.


I don't think that $4T would be enough to buy all bitcoins, no. Some people would not sell theirs on principle. And there is a major difference: The $4.5 trillion that the Fed has printed didn't directly go to the hands of average Joes. Imagine everyone that has a bitcoin now, would get $400,000 for it, and tried spending that.

The hardfork was proposed within the dev community but didn't gain sufficient support.

Meanwhile another plan to increase capacity had gained rough consensus within the bounds of the collaboration rules originally introduced by Gavin. Why are the people that supported the majority of the developer's plan now suddenly under any obligation to yield to that populistic minority plan? Maybe when seeing it from that perspective you can understand, why there is a disparity about who isn't working constructively?

Bitcoins were created at a rate of one block subsidy roughly every ten minutes. It took more than seven months for the first million bitcoins to have been created. Also see: [What keeps the average block time at 10 minutes?](
Today, it would roughly take 9 months, as the block subsidy has halved since then, but blocks are found much more reliably.

Everything in SegWit is built around what bit is being signalled on, all the P2P components, the network service flag, the witness-tx, block mesages, compact blocks, etc.                        
Especially, signaling on the wrong bit would be incompatible with the current SegWit activation process, so all the nodes that remain on code that follows the current activation process would ignore a segwit signaled for on the wrong bit, and this new proposal would need to add code to handle the ongoing activation process.

No, what the thread does, is to collect warning signs about Cloudmining services being Ponzis. If the thread says "A is a Ponzi" then I'd expect A not to be a safe investment.
When it says a service is legit, that means that they are actually performing hashing. It still doesn't mean that it will be a profitable investment. –
IMHO cloudmining as an investment seems to be a mistake altogether. I remain utterly unconvinced of the whole business model. 
Mining itself already has a very slim return rate, then putting both your investment and the hardware into the hands of a third party that wants an additional cut seems counterintuitive. With regular mining you can at least switch the pool when you are dissatisfied, with Clownmining you make yourself a hostage to changing circumstances.

Angle bisector obviously is a self-send, a lot of those addresses also receive multiple incoming transactions later. Some of those might be mobile phone wallets, of which many spend the change back to the same address and get used more often than once. Others might be merchants with a fixed address, or donation addresses.
Horizontal lines obviously are addresses that receive coins over and over.
Vertical lines are either the formed by aforementioned horizontal lines that send out transactions in a similar fashion they receive them, (see first distinct horizontal line) or just addresses that split big amounts to a lot of new addresses, i.e. tipping services, spam?
All the other lines are slanted in some fashion meaning that older addresses sent to newer addresses. That is pretty much expected. They might be forming patterns as there could be some typical lengths of time that coins get hold. E.g. coinbase maturation, six blocks before move, swiping money from paper wallet to mobile wallet, then paying some bill.

Satoshi Nakamoto is an unknown person or group of people that were the author of the first version of Bitcoin.
To prove that somebody is associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, they would only need to prove that they have access to private keys associated with early blocks mined in the Bitcoin blockchain. This would be simple to do by sending a challenge to the candidate and asking them to sign it with the private key in question. I.e. ask them to sign "*I'm Satoshi Nakamoto, it's the second of may. 123k721.*"  
If they were in possession of the respective private key, they'd be able to deliver a valid signature in no time, which then again could be confirmed by the public. Again, this would be easy for Satoshi to do, and impossible for anyone not associated with Satoshi.
However, Craig Wright instead appears to have signed something on his own computer, and only threw up a lot of smoke by providing a tutorial on how encryption works. He has not provided any proof of being Satoshi although claiming to be him. Therefore, people are skeptical, as proving should have been easy if it were true.
As to why he would want to claim to be Satoshi? No clue. Perhaps he thinks he could con everyone, but he should know that any such claim would be evaluated by countless geeks worldwide watching closely. Maybe he just craves the attention.

How many txs would an 2 (or 4) mb HF add?
The number is dependent on the mix of transactions being used, but for the current composition segwit would allow approximately for the amount of transactions that fit in a 2.2MB legacy block.


No. That's a pure increase of capacity without any scalability improvements. We already have about 1% stale blocks per day. Just pumping up blocksize without considering other aspects of the network would mean to trade short term benefits for long term drawbacks.

Costs of Bitcoin transactions are unrelated to the amount of value transferred, but rather proportional to the blockspace they fill. It would therefore make no sense whatsoever to price transactions relative to the transferred value. 
By the way, if we were paying fees relative to the transferred value, small transactions would still be priced out, as they would be the least profitable for miners to confirm.
Finally, just because you didn't realize that blockspace was a limited good doesn't mean that the system should be adapted to fit your beliefs. Rather, you should perhaps include the new information to improve your perception of reality.

They are talking about `Block 6,930,000`, the last block to create new coins. But then thinking about it, that 2140 date really isn't all that exciting: It is just the "reward halving" where the reward goes from 1 satoshi per block to 0 satoshis per block. But then, already one satoshi per block really isn't all that much.
In ~2035 99% of the Bitcoins will be mined.  
In ~2060 99.99% of the Bitcoins will be mined.

While UASF is short for User Activated Soft Fork, much more apt would be **User-enforced flag-day Activated Soft Fork**: it's not a sybil attack, node count doesn't make the race. It's the idea that a sufficiently large portion of the ecosystem will only buy coins from blocks that signal for segwit _starting with a flag day_.
So, while node count is an indicator for the readiness of the network to adopt the UASF, it's the economic weight these nodes stand for that is actually interesting. One entity spinning up hundreds of nodes in a data center does not prove economic weight, it's just a waste of money.

Mostly reasonable arguments, but I'd be interested why you strongly oppose the method of implementing the hard fork, which you conclude in the end, but haven't mentioned in the rest of the post.
I also don't understand why you feature the bandwidth as a limit for full nodes:
On a 1 mbit/s connection you can download 75 MiB in 10 minutes. From my understanding with the header first blocks and inverted bloom filter completion strategy you will already have the block data as "unconfirmed transactions", so you don't have to download the whole blocks again once they are found, you just need to get the remaining transactions and the header. It seems to me then, that even a 1 mbit/s connection would be enough for the proposed 16.7MiB blocks and the 33.4 MiB blocks that would follow two years later. But then that would be an upper limit, as from current statistics it is unreasonable to expect blocks to exhaust the limit, as even with our currently much lower limit this has not been the case.
I sincerely doubt that there are many full-node maintainers that live on a 1mbit/s connection.
In your post you also seem to be assuming that there is a correlation of the average block size and the block size limit. Why should that be the case? There will certainly be an increase over time if there is more room in the blocks, but it should be correlated to the Bitcoin adoption and increased usage, not to the block size limit – That would be like expecting that suddenly there are much more cars going from one city to another, just because a second highway has been added to connect them.

In the longterm one would expect mining operations to be economical. Therefore, the cost will be limited by the block rewards.
Block rewards are composed by the block subsidy and the transaction fees. As the block subsidy diminishes over time, the mining market should adjust to profiting from fees alone.
So, I guess you're asking how big the total of the transaction fees will be in the long run. That I can't answer, though.
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:00:19
Interesting points, however I would contend that subdividing Bitcoins beyond satoshis is _not_ trivial. Under the hood, the network currently operates on satoshi. There is lots of code that was written under that assumption. With all the grief that the raising of the block limit has seen, which many have also considered a "temporary anti-spam measure", I'm not sure anything that requires that level of consensus is trivial. And shifting the atomic unit of Bitcoin would require such consensus.

It's not. 1) P2SH-P2WPKH transactions are actually bigger than P2PKH transactions, 2) there fit more of those into a segwit block, 3) which makes math say **blocks are bigger**, and segwit is *not* a "size reduction of block data".
So, even assuming your math were right, the inputs to your calculation are wrong and your result is meaningless. 


Just fucking HF the thing to bigger blocks, and call it a day.
Whatever blocksize increase we apply, segwit or HF, blocks will be full again eventually which makes your argument obsolete because it applies to either proposed solution.

Again, you're conflating two different problems: Old software not estimating fees at all is an easily identifiable problem and different from rising prices for a scarce resource. Using a fee estimating wallet doesn't require others to use crappy wallets.  
I think we both agree that there is more demand for blockspace than availability. The mempool hasn't completely emptied out lately. 
However, the demand is not constant, it peaks and dips:   
Minimal inclusion fees increase at peak demand and drop back to below 10 satoshis per byte at times. This is what I meant with "a cycle". When a few blocks are found in rapid succession or demand is lower, the transactions that just barely missed previous blocks get included.
I agree that if we had a consistent excess demand prices would rise and some people would have to optimize their transaction usage or would find other means to transact. This is an obvious consequence of a scarce good being bought on a free market. I don't think the fee would grow explosively though as it's a self-balancing system: Higher prices reduce demand, lower demand reduces the price. Not every transaction would merit an unlimited fee increase.
I don't think the difference in our views is the assumptions, but rather whether we think that Bitcoin should cater to every single transaction ever created.
Edit: Actually it looks to me like the mempool was almost completely empty today:   
Funnily this introduces another problem for wallets with bad fee estimation. At this point they would likely overpay, while fee estimating wallets would save their users money.

To be honest, I hadn't heard anything about the "Lightning Network", until I saw your comment here. I saw that you had submitted a topic on it, but it was deleted again. Why is that?
However, it does seem to me that the "Lightning Network" is essentially a mechanism to relegate promises to pay via something akin to a web of trust. However, many Bitcoiners seem to be inherently opposed to credit based systems, as they reintroduce counterparty risk to a trustless system. I do realize that the slides' authors suggest they have a solution to this, but it hasn't become clear to me from looking through the slides whether it would actually work. Altogether the LN seems similar to how Ripple transfers value in its network.

Every transaction cannot assign more money than it got in its funding. Every block cannot have more output than the total inputs plus the block subsidy. Thus, when you create more money, nobody else will accept the block because it breaks the rules.

I might not have put that clearly before. There really is no reason to wait: If your new transaction doesn't propagate now, it'll still propagate eventually as other nodes drop the previous one. Or you could publish the transaction directly onto blockchain.info, which I believe does keep duplicate transactions. Most likely some of the miner nodes also allow duplicates as they can earn a higher fee and better user experience by helping users to unstuck their bitcoins. So it should eventually propagate to the miners and, as it's more attractive, get mined.
Should however your first transaction still confirm, your wallet would drop the new transaction as invalid anyway. (Or at the latest after a second `-zapwallettxes`, I'm not sure whether a wallet drops their own transaction when it becomes invalid silently.)
So, really there is no harm in trying right away.

OP is running a full-node on the network, which is a Bitcoin client that has a complete copy of the blockchain, and therefore can act as a seed for downloads of blocks, check validity and relay transactions, as well as serve thin-clients requesting information about blocks and transactions. Full-nodes are what allows the network to exchange information. Full-nodes are necessary for miners to know what information to build a block from, but they aren't used for mining directly.

No, there are two exit transactions and two corresponding anti-cheat transactions. Your exit transaction locks your funds for an agreed upon number of blocks, during which my anti-cheat transaction can already spend the money to me.
I can only respond with my anti-cheat transaction to your obsolete exit transaction. Vice versa, your anti-cheat only fits on top of my exit transaction. So you cannot use your anti-cheat transaction on your own exit transaction.
Also, if you offer a doublespend on your exit transaction against my anti-cheat transaction, it will only become available for mining after the lock. By that time, my anti-cheat should have long been confirmed.

You're conflating two different things:
* A transaction that has a magnitudes too low fee because it was created by outdated software
* A transaction that doesn't make it into a block because current demand is pricing it out
The former will likely never get confirmed as the backlog never clears completely, the latter might take longer to confirm but may be included in a later block as demand recedes in the naturally occurring cycles.
I disagree by the way that every wallet having good fee calculation would ramp up fees much quicker. Just as now, transactions that didn't succeed at first would be sent again with an appropriate fee.

reddit doesn't serve news, it just collects links to news, so really it is the online branches of newspapers mostly that deliver the news.
Facebook has 1.6 billion users, Diaspora – the greatly hyped p2p Facebook killer – has 400k, and is as far as I know the biggest p2p social network. It encapsulates the observation on the success of decentralized platforms replacing market leaders perfectly in my opinion.
Comparing people that use file-sharing with music vendors is a lame analogy, as shopping is a legal contract, which file-sharing isn't. Instead tell me about a successful p2p shopping platform selling music…

**TL;DR: `-zapwallettexes` and resend usually works immediately. Longer explanation below.**
There is not a single "the mempool" but each node has its own mempool. 
Since your mempool is cleared by restarting, and `-zapwallettxes` deletes unconfirmed transactions from your wallet, your wallet will be unaware of the transaction upon restart.
Other nodes will clean out their mempool by throwing out the lowest `fee per byte` transactions first. Any that still have your old transaction in their mempool will not accept the new one (except for XT nodes, that actually relay doublespends). In fact, if the fee is high enough to remain in lots of mempools, the new transaction might have a hard time propagating, and the old transaction might be relayed back to your node after you start your bitcoin-qt with `-zapwallettxes` directly.
So, if you don't wait for the transaction to be dropped by the network's mempools, it might not work. However, it is my experience that most low-fee transactions don't survive long in other mempools as they are the first to be pruned, and all the times I've walked people through the recovery it worked immediately.

The bug in the transaction validation was fixed and the fixed software version considered block 74638 invalid. A new blockchain tip was created on 74637 that overtook the invalid blockchain at 74691. Blocks produced by the new version are valid by the old version. Therefore, what happened was a softfork.

That's exactly the important point: There were two conferences on scaling and the majority of the developers found SegWit to be a better priority to increase capacity than the 2MB-hardfork. That's when they changed their opinion and decided to push for SegWit. As you might remember, nullc then suggested that the furter plan would be to do a "SegWit-adjusted" 2-4-8, i.e. SegWit-2-4.
So when you're saying that you want SegWit and also want to increase the non-witness that's what nullc has proposed last winter and since. The only difference I see is that you want both at once and he proposes to let one settle in before the next is heaped on top.

I wish we would have had SegWit three months ago and the code for a hardfork next year merged already. I'm a big fan of LN, and have written quite a bit about it, but it's not here yet. Nor are sidechains. :-/
But to be honest, I also think that all this political dirt flinging basically made it impossible to find an earlier compromise.

The funny thing is that I'd be surprised if quantum computing were actually applicable to mining. 
Quantum Computing will be useful for trying lots of possible solutions in parallel for __one problem__ such as factoring and discrete logarithms.  
Mining is a deterministic calculation that just needs to be repeated very often for __different inputs__. 
Therefore, you'd have to build a quantum computer that solves for block header composition, which however can only be evaluated by performing a hash on each. That doesn't sound like it would work. Sounds like another Clownmining Ponzi to me.

No, it's different. This transaction is not timelocked to the future, but uses CSV to lock your transaction output. After you've sent the transaction to yourself, you cannot spend the output for X amount of time. However, it does allow my anti-cheat transaction to spend the output to me.
So, it actually does get mined, but you cannot spend the output, while I can claim it due to having the anti-cheat transaction signed by you allowing me to claim it right away.

Mining difficulty is a feedback control system: When miners are solving blocks quickly, difficulty increases, when miners are solving blocks slowly, difficulty decreases. Therefore, it would also be possible that with the diminishing reward mining difficulty would discontinue its growth and the network's security would suffer.
Hopefully, either fees or the number of transactions rise sufficiently to pay for adequate security.

There is a big difference: The problem with printing money is that it is devalueing what is already in the market.
Say you had $5 out of $100 in existence. You would own 5% of the currency's total worth. Now the Fed prints $100 more. The market cap for the dollar remains the same and you only have 2.5% of the currency's total worth. Essentially, the worth of your savings just halfed.
Contrary, when you have 5BTC out of 100BTC, you have 5% of the currency's total worth. Switching to mBTC, you have 5,000mBTC out of 100,000mBTC - you still have 5% of the currency's total worth.

Nobody is sensitive about it because it is so new, it's just that your point doesn't make sense.
Using mBTC makes sense because it is easier to represent prices in an understandable way. It's like saying "2 tablespoons of sugar", instead of "1/8 of a cup". It describes both the same amount of sugar, but you can understand much easier how much it is. Printing more money is an entirely different beast.
