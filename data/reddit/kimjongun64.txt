I like Monero because she doesn't gossip

I'm in the same boat my man. Just got $100 of each paycheck auto set to paying for more bitcoin and a few stocks. Im almost to .1 though so I'm getting there

Buy phenibut from Liftmode.com. It's a wonderful supplement and the boys at r/nootropics can tell you all about it. Best thing about the website though, is that it accepts bitcoin!

The article said "the right time to buy Bitcoin was a week or so ago(before Segwit locked in)" and that's great because that's exactly when I told my friends to buy.

After actually watching the video It's just a typical mainstream media bashing of bitcoin "It has no value like gold or silver".

The idea is that the people who have to pay a significant amount are only people who do a lot of buying. Taxing the rich does nothing because there's a million and one ways to get out of it. But taxing buying stuff on Amazon, and for companies to run adds on Facebook gets money from those who already have the luxury to spend a lot of it

I'm surprised so much r/bitcoin is anti-yang. I would have guessed that most bitcoin supporters would be for such radical changes to the economy

Buy a jetski, or a shitload of cocaine. Or both. 
Or you could donate it, if you really don't want anything.

A value added tax on digital goods. Since so much money is being made off the attention economy and ecomerce we miss out on a lot of tax revenue

His entire campaign is built around the fact that he has already done the math lol

Fair enough. I forgot about the Bitcoin crowd being largely based on libertarian philosophy

To be fair Satoshi wasn't a serial inventor genius like Tesla or Edison or Da vinci. He took ideas that other people already had such as public ledgers and public key cryptography and came up with the simple solution of a blockchain to solve the problem of doublespending. It's a revolutionary invention indeed but I don't think it calls for a genius as it's a fairly simple solution. Satoshi's real credit IMO comes from the creativity of his solution and him looking to solve a problem nobody knew they needed. The hero we needed but didn't want

Aw I remember watching this in 2017 at the beginning of the school year. Telling my Statistics teacher to take a mortgage on his house to buy Bitcoin. Then a month later telling him he would have 2.8 million dollars. This video actually introduced me to Galantis, got a lot of good songs if you like EDM

I still used it until recently when it stopped accepting Paypal. It has good rates and is so unbelievably easy to use.

With coins like Monero, they do have a legitimate separate identity from Bitcoin. A lot of alt coins basically ride the bitcoin price wave but with some it's worth investing in just because you believe in the technology. Just like Bitcoin.

I still remember buying bitcoin with Virwox and Paxful since coinbase was shit. Now everyone and their grandma has an exchange. Bitcoin price has gone down a lot but the amount of bitcoin related infrastructure has grown leaps ahead since 2017

Oh I didn't know. Still might be helpful info for all our traders out there
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:04:24
I was in the same boat. Virwox.com. Nobody seems to know about this site but it's easily the most convenient and fast site for &lt;$500 transactions.

Xapo will not support both coins but will allow you to withdraw or sell BCC after the fork

My personal favorite is VirWoX. Not exactly a bitcoin exchange but a great, easy, anonymous way to transfer bitcoin and paypal.
