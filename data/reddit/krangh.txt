Just bought your app and will test it now.
I will provide you some feedback later on.

Lol, like europe is a country. Nice!
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:35:05
I am not 100% sure if I understand what I have read. :/
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:25:04
I meant in relation to the article you linked. I think I understood that the article talks about weaknesses in regards to random numbers for example.
So, does this apply to the seed words which we are given when we create a wallet?
Does it mean that these seed words are potentially weak?
@_date: 2019-07-04 03:32:16
Ok, I understand. Thanks for the explanation mate! ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:58:20
Yeah really terrible! I advise everyone to sell all their Bitcoin NOW, before the price drops even more.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:10:05
This is not true. The Nano X has an autolock feature! Check the settings on your device mate!
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:21:24
Your should get a hardware wallet. That's actually the safest way to store your assets.
Many people, me too, have a Ledger like the Nano S or the new Nano X.
But there are other hardware wallets like Trezor.
Check some YouTube videos and get one you like.

Don't use Coinbase as your wallet! These guys are not trustworthy!
They have been manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other assets many times!

How can I send Bitcoin through my node when I have a Ledger wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:14:16
If you "buy" Bitcoin with stop/loss orders, then you are most probably NOT buying real Bitcoin which you can transfer to a wallet!
Instead this is most probably some sort of trading like CFD for example.

Sadly for some reason it takes ages to download the blockchain in first place.
I am still downloading it.... Since december! And I have a 500/275 internet connection.
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:31:10
Same for me on my Mac Mini. I thought it would be cool to run a node maybe, but it loads since weeks. :/
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:41:01
Well, my Mac Mini only has a standard HDD drive. So that makes the download of the blockchain so slow?
Whenever I check the progress, I can see that I am only connected to 0 or 1 other nodes.
I am personally thinking that this is the issue. Because at the beginning I had about 8 connections and the download was super fast.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:26:35
And why exactly do you believe this?
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:55:10
Is a fixed IP a requirement for a lightning node?
@_date: 2019-01-16 05:07:03
Ok thanks. So I could possibly setup a lightning node then once the blockchain is downloaded.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:43:59
Hold! Definitely hold!
I bought some bits of a Bitcoin when it was at ATH, and I am still holding.
@_date: 2019-01-16 05:05:44
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:22:52
It means that you don't sell your Bitcoin. You bought them to hold them. Hold  = Hodl

You can't read that shit without a subscription.
@_date: 2019-09-17 05:09:09
WTF is wrong with you?!
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:20:18
No. It was because of some whales bought massively bitcoin at a low price to get it rise. And then dump everything at that high price to make it crash.
There was some conspiracy about that it was from China I believe. It even had some operation name.
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:31:42
That's a great site! Thanks for that link mate, I bookmarked that one.
