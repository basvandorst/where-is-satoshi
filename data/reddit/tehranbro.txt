So does the entire market have to adopt to these methods so cost of transactions drop? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:21:50
Yes, but long term if you want adoption there will also be a tax charged. IRS doesn't give tax breaks to companies because they get paid in bitcoin.

How is this wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:29:01
I understand currently bitcoin lacks this feature, but what is the long term chances of this being resolved and bringing the cost of transactions to pennies.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:42:20
Understand, but if adoption of bitcoin increases so will the price. Like $15,000 USD is pennies if it gets adopted worldwide. So we are looking at $100-200 per transaction if it gets accepted everywhere.

So the only solution so far is something in construction, Not something I feel confident in.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:44:52
Yes just becase I ask a question I'm a shill.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:15:49
So does this mean that the transaction fees are hard coded into bitcoin. That means long term there is no fix for this.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:01:12
Can someone tell me what is the use of bitcoin with transaction fees of $25? Also is it possible for transaction fees to drop in the future or is it something hard coded into the algorithm?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:30:56
Please provide source of these transaction costs.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:37:08
I understand that, but I am talking about if people are looking for adoption on a worldwide scale we need to bring transaction costs down to pennies and time of transaction down to milliseconds.  I want to understand what the chances of this happening are.

Cash out and save your money.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:12:48
So do the people still playing Pokemon Go.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:15:19
At what price will you stop weathering the storm?
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:18:24
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:23:09
Bottom could be $0. Don't delude yourself.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:24:00
Don't worry it's coming. Nothing is going to stop this selloff.
