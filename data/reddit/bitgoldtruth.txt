They aren't a scam in any way as far as I can tell. And I've spent a lot of time looking at potential scams like Paycoin and Bitgold, Inc. They have nothing to do with e-gold-- you are completely misinformed. They have the technical chops, amazing PR and marketing, and a model that seems to be working well. Centralized, so I don't hold money with UH, but not a scam and a great way to buy BTC from any bank account in the world.  Why are  you spreading FUD about UH? What do you have against them?
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:22:24
Such crooks!  Or maybe just inept, negligent, stupid, careless. These assholes make all our lives more difficult. Luckily bitcoin cannot be stopped even by these shitheads. Viva la BTC!
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:16:47
Uphold is an incredibly cheap way to buy BTC. It's centralized, but that's fine since I buy BTC and then move it out to my off-line wallet. I don't like centralized services to hold my BTC, but it's free to move cash (USD, but it can be done from anywhere in Europe or the UK)from my bank account to my UH account and then convert to BTC at the Bitstamp mid-market rate. It's free (up to $10k or something) to move those BTC to my hot wallet then I put them into cold storage. I've been buying BTC with UH since they turned on connections to US banks.
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:19:49
Well that might just mean you are smarter than the average bear. But I agree, not a scam at all.
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:25:40
Careful with bitgold, Inc-- I've flagged the many issues with them in previous posts. If not a scam, they seem very vulnerable to getting hacked.  Caveat Emptor FTW!

Bitcoin is the new gold, but how to bring the goldbugs over to bitcoin.  Maybe: 
gold&lt;== gold colored coins ==&gt;bitcoin
fiat is a bigger scam than paycoin, it's just when everyone is being scammed or in on the scam, it's hard to see the scam. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:25:35
PF18-- I'd welcome some help getting to the bottom of whether bitgold, inc is a scam or just destined to blow-up Gox-style.
Here are my first two threads investigating:
Is Bitgold, Inc a Scam (Part I): 
Is Bitgold, Inc a Scam (Part II): 
The community needs to be an early warning system so that people don't lose their money to scamsters like Garza or (maybe) these Bitgold, Inc guys (Sebag and Crumb).
I welcome any help shining a light before people's coins and cash disappear into the pockets of scammers or the hackers who clean out poorly-architected systems (looking at you Bitstamp!)
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:03:00


Me too and I agree. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:37:47
Hi Emily!  Thanks for responding. I really hope you guys are legit.  So can you confirm that you guys will be centralized vs. decentralized.
Thanks for confirming the Soros and Sprott participation--congrats on getting such big name investors to back your project.
As for my questions and comments, I prefer to ask them out in the open. I could ask you privately, but then I'd post the results here anyway for the benefit of the community. I'm curious about this:


As neither of the two founders have any tech experience, what were they designing and implementing exactly?  
Looking at the backgrounds of Crumb and Sebag, they have no technical experience, no start-up experience, no dev experience.
Sebag seems to be a speculator on precious metals via various companies that have not done particularly well. His latest, before Bitgold, Inc, Loma Vista, was founded almost four years ago and has done nothing, produced nothing. From all I can find online it's just an empty shell. He's got a bunch of other ventures of which he is the Founder-- Natural Resources Holdings, Braavos Capital, Essentia Equity--that also don't seem to have done anything from what I can tell online. Am I wrong about that?  Natural Resources Holding was another reverse-merger into a public company--an Israeli one that used to be dedicated to printing.  Forgive my ignorance about all these complicated transactions, but it strikes me as more finance shenanigans than the building of real companies that provide real goods and services to real people. Am I wrong.
As for Crumb, he also has no technical or devops experience and very little start-up experience. The latest venture he worked for--of which he seems to still be CFO if Linked In is to be believed--was spun out of notorious patent troll company Intellectual Ventures.  It is called Coffee Flour (  At least it's a start-up that offers a real product. Is Josh going to continue working at coffeeflour?  Is there any relationship between Intellectual Ventures and bitgold?
Josh also lists himself as Co-Founder of Loma Vista-- the publicly listed company that Bitgold,Inc is being merged into. Here's how Loma Vista is described on Bloomberg:


I also [read] ( that Loma Vista gave up their Dorothy Lake project in order to merge with Bitgold, Inc. 
You'll forgive me if it all seems a bit fishy-- a company without a product or service (just a countdown clock), raises $3.5mm from the Soros children, then a month or so later opts to reverse-merge into a public shell company. This is not the way tech start-ups are usually built, as you are maybe aware.
Also, can you please explain [this SEC Filing] (  It seems to indicate that Bitgold has raised or is seeking to raise 600k from US investors. Are those the Soros children?  
I'm sorry if this comes across as overly-skeptical. The bitcoin community has suffered through so many scams that I really hope you guys are legit.
And there have been so many hacks of poorly-architected sites and systems that I really, really am concerned about the total lack of devops and tech start-up experience of Sebag and Crumb. 
Thanks Emily Cornelius!  Looking forward to your responses. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:53:11
Or you can help me figure out if these guys are scammers, incompetents, or legit.  Oh wait, but that would make you part of Emily Cornelius and my super sneaky con game to pump up Bitgold, Inc. Better just watch as I dig and Emily dances. Stay tuned Vasyrr!
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:34:41
The 12% commissions strike me as boiler-room style practices, so that the brokers are going to be motivated to pump the crap out of this offering.  Again, the opposite of what you're suggesting. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:41:45
That's awesome. Well, if old Emily even touched the dominoes I set up, I guess you'd have a point. All she does is say that she's super thrilled at all the enthusiasm.
The guys behind this thing have zero experience building tech start-ups, they have a bunch of shell companies that do nothing, they are doing all sorts of weird transactions before they even have a product or service.  
I don't **know** that Bitgold, Inc is a scam or if it's just a disaster waiting to happen due to the lack of tech chops of the founders, but either way it's something I'm interested in digging into. If I can prevent people from losing a ton of coin or fiat in another Gox-like shitshow, then why not?
But I get your point. I've never seen that skeptic as part of con play, but I can see how it would work.
Emily hasn't said a single thing to reassure me that this isn't either a scam or another Gox in the making.
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:41:04
Emily you're not answering any of my questions. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. 
Ppdai looks cool: 
I will take a look. But surely you know there's a big difference between seeding a tech company and building a tech company.
Can you answer my questions please? Thanks.
Your analogy of football coach giving away his playbook doesn't really work. I'm not asking for your playbook. I am trying, on behalf of the crypto and bitcoin community, to determine if Bitgold, Inc is a scam that is going to cause more negative press and skepticism about crypto and bitcoin. I don't want your playbook, I want to understand how two non-technical people who have never built a tech start-up are going to offer a safe, secure, and useful service under the name bitgold.
What was that SEC filing all about?  What is the 600k number? 
Can you give any more color on what Sebag's current ventures do? Are they all shell companies like Loma Vista?
If you want to earn trust, answer the questions--that's the only way.
We redditors don't really give a turd about anything but the facts.
And what does going public have to do with having an open and transparent dialogue?  
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:29:49
Emily-- no one who hasn't built a "great team" before can just up and do it.  You don't have to be in SV to have a great start-up. But you can't just wave away questions with references to Scala and node.js. You are making me--and anyone with technical chops--more skeptical, not less.  
We don't need more scams or poorly implemented crypto/bitcoin projects.  And the fact that you don't answer questions and just tap dance around the issues I raise, make me want to dig more and more.
So that's what I'm a gonna do.
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:26:47
Ha-- you totally caught me, Vasyrr!  I'm trying to build brand equity in Bitgold, Inc by pointing out all the ways that it looks like a disaster waiting to happen. It's jujitsu marketing and Emily Cornelius and I are totally in on it!  Nice catch, dude!
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:24:53
Vasyrr-- I'm just a guy trying to get to the bottom of something that smells super fishy. I'm more and more confident that Bitgold, Inc is a scam, so I'm not trying to pump them up in the least.
You can read about my motivation for starting this investigation here:  
I get why you're skeptical, but it's pretty much the opposite of what you're suggesting.

Ethereum is not a scamcoin! GTFO!
@_date: 2016-02-14 18:03:49
OP is way off and sounds like he's a competitor spreading FUD.
Uphold is centralized, so I don't use them, but they are legit and have become a very important part of the BTC ecosystem.
I've looked a the Voxel (VOX) as a potential scam (because that's what I like to do)-- see my previous posting history about Paycoin, Bitgold, etc.
Voxel is a pre-mine, but it does have a very specific real-world use-case-- the purchase of content on Voxelus.com. 
UH puts it all out there on their transparency page, which is the only reason OP could do this analysis. I applaud that transparency.
TL;DR: Voxel not a scamcoin, Uphold is solvent and the only financial service in the world that I know of that is 100% transparent in real-time. Instead of bashing UH, why not demand that Circle and Coinbase and Bitstamp also implement real-time transparency.
You might not like their management, but there is no denying that they benefit BTC by offering an excellent and innovative service.
Again-- I don't like them and don't use them, but let's save cries of insolvency and scamcoin for the company's that deserve it. I've been guilty of this myself and now am much more careful. There's plenty of bad guys in this space, but UH is not one of them.
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:39:32
This is a great analysis. But you forgot to mention that Bitreserve is centralized and therefor requires a trusted third-party, whereas Coinapult is decentralized and therefore you don't have that risk of loss with Coinapult.
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:50:23
Be careful with Bitgold, Inc. Everything that comes about them sets off warning bells for me. I've been too busy on my own bitcoin project to follow up on my due diligence about them. But if you look at my previous posts, I lay out what makes Bitgold, Inc seem like a scam to me: no tech experience, sketchy reverse merger, vaporware, and their customer service rep evades lots of questions. 
I'll get back to my due diligence next week on Bitgold, Inc. In fact Mr. Bitsy has inspired me to do my own comparison of the different bitgold services.  Nice job. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:09:25
a buck worth of IOU! Hoo-boy. That's awesome. Give me decentralized BTC over centralized trusted third party every single fucking time.

Ripple and Stellar are the Milli Vanilli of Cryptocurrency.

This is why it's important for the community to dig when a new crypto venture or coin or service is launched. Unfortunately it's easy for scamsters to pump stuff up with press releases, social media astroturfing, and bloggers who are more interested in getting paid and being read than uncovering the truth about the subjects of their blogposts. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 04:38:22
Craig Wrong stank of scam and had hoax written all over him.
The MSM was duped as they so often are because they are lazy and don't understand technology.
The community can overcome all sorts of obstacles.
We are the early warning system for the detection of crypto-bullshitters.
Stay safe out there people.

Centralized BS.  Might as well worry about Bitreserve taking your money.  Never going to work.
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:33:44
Amen to that!  But real decentralized bitgold (gold-backed colored coins) is the bridge to massive bitcoin adoption IMHO.
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:12:13
Centralized nonsense. BTC isn't about trusting Bitreserve to hold my money. BTC is about not having to trust anyone.  Why are we celebrating another centralized system on this subreddit?
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:33:32
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Bitgold, Inc reeks of a  scam and/or disaster waiting to happen.
1. People behind it have zero tech devops experience.
2. Sketchy reverse merger to "go public" : reeks of pump and dump.
3. "Customer Service" dancing around questions and responding to serious qualms with platitudes.
4. Inconsistencies in amounts of capital raised, investors who are participating, etc, etc.
5. Beta Site but no users-- why has no one posted screenshots of working account?
6. Already have [litigation] ( with Bitreserve: a respected and established, albeit centralized, service.
Do we really need another Paycoin, Neo &amp; Bee, Mt. Gox.
Even if these guys aren't just pumping and dumping a la Garza, with no tech chops at all it's pretty much guaranteed that they will be hacked before too long.  
Caveat Emptor!!!
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:59:49
I will never use Bitreserve or other centralized services like Bitgold, Inc, which in addition to being centralized also appears to be a total scam. You guys seem legit, but I'll still never use you. You guys are masters of PR though. Congrats on that. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 06:22:12
Gold colored coins could be the bridge to mainstream adoption of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is too volatile to be adopted by consumers at this point.
Gold-backed assets accounted for on the blockchain would drive demand for bitcoin by goldbugs and mainstream financial institutions.
That's a step we need toward bitcoin displacing fiat.
But please be careful with Bitgold, Inc. It has all the hallmarks of a scam and/or disaster waiting to happen.
1. People behind it have zero tech devops experience.
2. Sketchy reverse merger to "go public" : reeks of pump and dump.
3. "Customer Service" dancing around questions and responding to serious qualms with platitudes.
4. Inconsistencies in amounts of capital raised, investors who are participating, etc, etc.
5. Beta Site but no users-- why has no one posted screenshots of working account?
6. Already have [litigation] ( with Bitreserve: a respected and established, albeit centralized, service.
7. That litigation would seem to violate [this agreement] ( they filed with the Canadian Stock Exchange where they're trying to go public.

The people involved are serious developers with serious tech chops. 
Will their big idea work? Who knows.
Is it great news for bitcoin? Yes.
The more serious, legit people with experience building and shipping, the better it is for the crypto community.
What we need less of is scammy scamfucks like MT. Gox, Neo &amp; Bee, Paycoin, most alt coins, and most recently Bitgold, Inc.
Note: scams include not only cons like Paycoin and Neo&amp; Bee but clueless shitheads like lardass Karpeles and the Canadian Bitgold, Inc guys who launch incredibly complicated platforms/products that are inevitably going to be hacked because of their lack of experience building or running tech companies.
Caveat emptor everyone!

It's like with the holocaust. Lots of people have to be complicit for a super shitty thing to happen that victimizes many. Not that the paycoin scam is morally comparable to the holocaust, but you get what I mean. I'm pretty sure Bitgold, Inc is a scam like Paycoin. I'm digging to find out and will be sure to share what I learn. Whether people pay attention or not, as you discovered with your Paycoin warnings, is another matter. "A fool and his money..."
