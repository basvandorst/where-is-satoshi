Wondering if this is a big pump to 15k+ before futures start trading.  Big dump right before Sunday night?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:47:39
971 wall at 17250!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:42
I know, I'm all over the place right now haha
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:19:12
4 coins brah
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:53:06
The spread now is only around 0.5%, not another 1.5%
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:59:58
Same, and just did it yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:54:53
Yes. We are basically using this thread as a daily thread

GDAX 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:02:26
Fees on gdax should be 0 for this stuff if you use limit orders
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:18:15
From gdax to ledger is free for me 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:32:26
Bitcoin network transactions(Deposits/Withdrawals) on coinbase/gdaz are being serviced.  This happened last night too, and my transfer took a few hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:37:19
The app copay 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:52:01
Best bet is to check youtube for some videos explaining it
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:57:08
Exactly, because you never know your situation down the line.  The usual advice is put off higher taxed gains till later in life, especially when you stop working. Then you will likely be in a lower bracket. Obviously everyones situation is different though. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:41:06
Because you want it to be over a year to avoid short term gains tax, but also want to sell the bitcoins that appreciated the least, since then you only pay tax on the difference where you purchased vs sold. Like people mentioned, a good accountant can handle this if they know what they are doing. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:10:14
The delay/lag seem to make this very difficult.  GL though 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:00:05
I'm just going to post the same question for you.  Thanks guys:
So if I want to hold coins for a month, I would have to purchase them on the exchange, then send them to a wallet(for security/hacking reasons). Then if I want to sell them, I would send them back to the exchange website, and from there I would sell them, and have them send it to my bank?
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:26:22
Oh nice, that was what I was looking for.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:47:48
Well I haven't invested yet, any advice on this?
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:23:47
Because people are lunatics and think that banks or anything associated with them are evil...
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:26:11
I was thinking the same, I feel like arbitrage opportunists exist all over these different websites.   
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:02:50
First, it's unavoidable, so day trading will always be happening with bitcoins.  I actually think it' a good thing because it prevents a stale, non-trading market.  Also, as weird as it sounds, it helps lower the volatility and keeps the price more stable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:00:28
OK thanks, appreciate it
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:45:02
Who isn't trying to take advantage of bitcoins to make money?
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:29:02
No correlation exist between gold and bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:15:36
No doubt the exchanges are the winners here, even more now that everyone is trading them now.
Do you really think fees of 0.4% make a difference?  I feel like if you are day trading, you would be looking for 1-3% per trade.  I know it's wasted money, but I don't think it has much of an impact.  
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:45:51
It's down again...10 other post say this just under you.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:41:41
ummm no, people aren't dumping billions of dollars worth of gold for bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:39:06
you can't use paypal
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:33:52
Yeah I guess the lag makes it difficult to do this.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:10:43
Well that's an easy fix, just transfer the bitcoins you have in there to another wallet.
@_date: 2013-09-16 12:16:14
I received a partial amount back, but I am still waiting on about $800 that was in the middle of transferring to bitfloor(never actually made it into my bitfloot account, because during the transaction is when they shut down).  I sent multiple emails and still no response.  Not sure what to do next, but feel like I won't see that money ever again.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:54:59
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:31:48
Way to much chance of fraud in many ways.  What's stopping my friend who is a volunteer to just keep giving me these "lottery tickets?"  Idk it just doesn't seem feasible. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:12:08
YAY IM SO EXCITED!!
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:52:32
cool story bro
@_date: 2013-05-30 22:22:39
Yeah same happened to me. What's making me nervous is that the transfer amount was never added to my bitfloor account. They emailed me back saying they see it though...
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:31:13
A problem I see is someone doing the same thing, and they will give out 95% of winnings, which would make yours pointless.  A 10% cut is a lot no?
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:20:09
He bought them in person?  Kinda lame.  I feel like if you are going to write an article on buying bitcoins, you would use an example of how everyone has to buy them, not just a meetup on craigslist...
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:12:57
I do agree with this.  Still overvalued IMO.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:31:20
could be a pile of sticks then
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:28:24
You cannot conclude anything like this from one day of looking at the charts...
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:01:15
Any advice on what website to use(US)?
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:32:58
buy low, sell high!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:26:10
Same question here(US), any using paypal?
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:21:59
This doesn't even make sense...
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:06:21
yes, and from there you can send them to any exchange online.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:09:24
I really like the idea, but the thought of gambling money, with money that's already being gambled, is too risky.  You could win $100 at the table, then look and see you are down $100 from the drop in price.  Degen central!
When it stabilizes in a few months this could be a great way for US players to play again.

Hit the "WTF" link on the top right, it explains everything.
