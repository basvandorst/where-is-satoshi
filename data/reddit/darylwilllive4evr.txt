Why futures instead of actual bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:39:32
Depends when u bought it. When I joined it was 3.5k~. Also putting 100% of my portfolio in one very volatile and relatively new asset would've been very risky. Trading allows me to be diversified and risk averse with only a portion of my portfolio being exposed at one time.

Cant u just use gemini?

I probably make a handful of trades within 2 weeks if at all. Day trading, I think is overtrading at least for me. It's been pretty successful for me with my returns so it is realistic. It's difficult, risky and not perfect but it works.

If not Bittrex, Bitfinex or Poloniex then what?

It's a true saying though might not be for Bitcoin but it has been and will be a true statement for *some* assets. I'm guessing u dont't have a background in finance or economics.

Lol wat. I've had ~1000% returns in 6months which I would not have had if I didn't trade. Recently, I sold BTC at 18,900 and bought again at 14,000. That was fairly obvious for most experienced traders. 
  
Saying that it can be gambling, knowing nothing and thinking u can compete and beat other people trading in the market is stupid.

Let's call it BAT!
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:07:39
Holy shit I didnt even know that was possible! how can I avoid this? I would love to use an airgapped computer but its not possible for me (at least at the moment).

Thoughts? it seems we are in for some short term volatility at least
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:27:01
I think the article and the comment was funny, Obviously theres a possibility bitcoin might reach 50k in 2 years. I dont think people can accurately predict the price that longterm for something so volatile.
@_date: 2017-09-09 03:07:07
obviously bitcoin will survive but the chinese market will become smaller for it (possibly more if other govs follow lead?) and thus the value will become smaller. I really hope i'm wrong but it doesn't seem like it
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:23:00
Well even if I made the mistake I qould t charactwrise it as stealing. I would have made the mistake. It's like if I mistyped and sent bitcoin to the wrong wallet, it would be my fault. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:07:28
Thats great to know!

I think he's been in too many crypto subreddits and now finds it weird thay there's no circlejerk
@_date: 2017-09-09 03:00:29
china shutting down all fiat to crypto exchanges can't be good though, short term and long term.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:10:49
Wow if true, that's pretty good of them.
