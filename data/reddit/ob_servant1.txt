Bots. Some, if not tuned properly, will lose profits by reversing the highs and lows.

It'll dip but not like 2013/2014. That dip was mostly due to the Mtgox scandal.

Not everyone who bought bitcoin in 2010 are experts, not every noob is an idiot. Let people have their opinion and shut up if you don't agree.

I am poor and hoping to fund a vacation to Europe for my kids and my girlfriend one day. I'm going to try and buy $50 right now and based off my feelings when I get my student loans this spring semester I'll consider putting in $250 or maybe $500.
A trip to Europe means everything to my girlfriend, we've been through so many close break ups over the past 12 years. She's been losing confidence in my future career every year without really giving me a chance. 
Every time I try to start doing well in school I end up having to battle demons with her, our living situations, financial issues the kids and their issues.
I was patient and worked two jobs while she was in school and I made it all the way through to her graduation with a smile. Now it's her turn to let me work on my career goals and she buckles up before a year is even over. 
Life is tough and she takes every pebble on the highway as if it's a boulder. I look at every pebble as a small hiccup. I just think she's not used to living a lifestyle where we're living day to day and it's stressing her out and I want to help her so badly. 
It also doesn't help that our parents live in two different states 10 hours drive away from each other. Our schools are in each other's parents states so it's not easy for either of us. I just feel worse for her, but I hope we can get through this because I know once I graduate we'll be a lot better off with less stress about our financial situation. 
Here's to hoping bitcoin hits some crazy digit a year or two from now. Cheers
