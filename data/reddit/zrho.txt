The problem right now is that most of the user base is still just speculating. Yes, bitcoin is useful under certain circumstances, but it is not the be all and end all of currency. People seem to think it's magically going to replace all national currencies. For now, it's just gambling.

Just waiting for the €40 mark so Europe can join in on all this round number excitement...

One big issue that irks me is that it requires internet access (which 20% of US households lack, not to mention other countries). It's irritating in the same way that offline games that require a connection are. I'm saying this because I live in a rural area with god-awful satellite internet and I've worked jobs where we have to use the "knuckle-buster" credit card machines because we can't even get service. The lack of anything like FDIC insurance also poses a major roadblock; it's not a currency you'd want your savings in. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against bitcoin. It's just that, to most consumers, all it translates to is a few percent cheaper purchases from bypassing paypal, visa, etc.

Paper wallets cost nothing and are pretty straightforward to set up. They only really make sense for your "savings account", though.
