How much did you pay in network fees? Are you saying you sent yourself 0.001 BTC after the fees were deducted?

What am I looking at here? Someone buying millions of dollars worth of BTC? Why wouldn’t someone with this kind of money use a dollar cost averaging buy approach?

Why is it only affecting bitcoin? Can you go into more detail or link to some info?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:35:30
That’s not how any of this works

You can see the balance of your address is 0.001 BTC as expected: 
Possibly your wallet isn’t synced (though I think Exodus should take care of this pretty quickly and automatically) or Exodus doesn’t show balances to the thousandths place. You might be able to change that in settings somewhere. Either way your bitcoins have arrived to that address successfully.

I had the same thing happen to me. were you using a considerably weak password? I was as well as another person I talked to who had the same thing happen to them. I’m trying to figure out how we were compromised by finding commonality..

IMO by that time Earth will have been inducted into the intergalactic coalition of unified planets. The ICUP of course uses space bucks as their monetary unit which I predict will trade with BTC at ~100,000/BTC. You heard it here first folks.

I use a Ledger Nano as my wallet. I use Coinbase as a "debit account" when I plan on spending my Bitcoin.
