It wouldn't matter if it was bitcoin or not, lending and predatory lending between countries will keep on happening. The net positive for large players like the US, China, India, EU (especially western), Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc. is huge - that's why the federal reserve is doing it, that's why nobody is trying to get in their way. The only way to ensure money is used ethically is to allocate it yourself - good luck getting anybody to allow you to allocate where your taxes go.
We might switch to bitcoin for taxes and other cryptos for voting on laws and politicians, but it will take a lot longer for anyone to let us actually steer any country - that's the true power they have.
We already have cryptos that can anonymize to a certain extent the source and destination of funds, it will be out in the open, but the net effect is the same - the money stays unallocated for.

You are so off, you are not even wrong.

Not to be a bummer, but altpocket.io does the same thing - regarding the imports. They've been doing it since the summer and are on the verge of introducing version 2.0. It's  really hard to nail those imports correctly, especially with multiple exchanges and if you send off crypto between them or to a hardware wallet.
It's good to have variety though, good on you guys.

[Looking at this, it seems like around 57.28% of the 7.4 Billion people are in the correct range to own a BitCoin.]( I'll be a bi-gender shill and semi-mysoginist and suggest that 95% of women in that range don't fucking care about this unless they have a Smeg fridge. So that computes to 3.72 Million women and 2.13 Billion men, but let's say half the men are aware of crypto and want/can earn money with it, so combined they make up 1.07 Billion people. Of them probably a very small part can actually afford a whole Bitcoin even at Just Out of Hybernation January Bear Prices™ (JOHJBP from now on) - so let's say 20%, which is still optimistic and results in 214 million people with ability, knowledge and desire to own bitcoins.
Since the potential max is ~21 Million Bitcoin, out of which we probably already lost a bunch and Satoshi is keeping his 1 Million for CIA operations in the future, let's say there are going to be 11.11 million potential Bitcoins in a couple of years. 11.11 million BTC / 214 Million people =  0.0519 BTC per person if we divided it equally.
The problem is that distribution in the real world rarely follows the even distribution principle, in any sphere of life really. Let's use the US net worth distribution, which is truly one of the most extreme ones for a 1st world country - 40% of bitcoin will go to just 1% of those 214 Million people or -&gt; 2.14 million people will own 4.44 million of the BTCs -&gt; roughly 2.1 BTC per person, of course that's an average. The next 4% of 214M will own 27% of the BTC or -&gt; 8.56 million people own 3 million BTC, roughly 0.35 BTC each. The next top 35% will own the rest close to 33% of all BTC -&gt; 75 Million people and 3.67 Million BTC -&gt; 0.05 BTC each. [Nobody else will have any BTC for whatever reason, that's just how things get distributed in an irrational universe.](
Now looking at these numbers it seems pretty unrealistic that even 214 Million people around the world are aware of BTC, want to purchase and own some, have the means to do so, etc.
TL;DR - 2.1 BTC you are in the World Top 1%, 0.35 BTC you are in the next top 4%, 0.05 BTC and you are in the next top 35%. Anything lower than that and you are in the Bottom 60%, or at least you will be in a couple of years.

Technology usage will only increase with time until we merge with it as our evolution is not fast enough. With that being said, cryptocurrency has always been way more fair to poor and stupid people than the dollar or gold or diamonds have been recently. You could have been just lucky and got thousands of bitcoin 1 years ago and now be part of the three coma club. No need to be ultra rich, just fortunate/smart enough.

You know the whole world’s gold supplies found fit in an olympic size swimming pool. The other thing that nobody is talking about is what prevents a fork happening when all of BTC is pretty much mined - BTC2 is as much of an option at that point as BTC1’s price increasing to offset the need for more value to be created.
