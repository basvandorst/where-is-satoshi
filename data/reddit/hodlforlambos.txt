It is when you could’ve waited a day and bought the dip. Buying BTC at its peak in 2013 around 1.2K can be insane when you could’ve bought it for 1/6 that price the very next year. That means you could have accumulated nearly 6x more BTC. Buying 10 BTC at its peak in 2013 could’ve been 60 in 2014. 50 extra BTC a bit over 600K USD.

He fact that many people do it makes it work, lots of TA has to do with self fulfilling prophecies. If Everyone believes it’s going to occur and act in a way to make it happen, it’ll happen. You want to move with the market, not against.

No one can time the market perfectly and I didn't say I could either. What I'm saying was it wasn't hard to tell that buying at 19K was a dumb move. We were also going parabolic at 17.5K, which is why I sold there. My argument was that anything above 15K was basically too parabolic to be sustainable, so as long as you sold above 15K and didn't FOMO back in until it dipped, you made a good move. 
tl;dr It wasn't hard to tell that 19K+ wasn't going to sustain but that doesn't mean I was able to calculate that 19K was the top. It could've kept going up but with TA you could tell that it would dip down significantly due to little support and it rising to high to quick. Look back at past graphs, the same thing has happened multiple times from 200 to 2000. 
Edit: Simply speaking, it had more room to go down due to being in a parabolic curve than go up much higher.
Edit-Edit: Learn TA and you will win more often. You'll be able to maximize your profits as humanly possible. Watch some YouTube videos, it'll get you a lot further than buying at the ATH and hodling. Buy the dip sell the tip and repeat, not buy the ATH hold for a month hoping it'll cup and handle into a new ATH.

No, sold 17.5K and I’ve accumulated more around 12K each times it’s gone down around there

Obviously nothing is concrete but TA is the best way to increase your chances of winning. If you naked trade and first start you may win about 40% of the time but as time goes on and you learn TA, you can increase your chances significantly by not emotionally trading and panicking, to the point that you will only profit and it'll only be a matter of how much you profit since cryptocurrency market is crazy bullish. You just have to have risk management.

You use trend lines, ichimoku clouds, bollinger bands, stoch RSI, etc. to see where support levels are and you buy slightly over the support. If you look at BTC/USD for the past week you'll see that we've been in a symmetrical triangle pattern, which you can search up. Once you get close to the end of this triangle, you either breakout or breakdown with strong momentum. You can tell which one of these it will do by seeing whether its closer to the triangle's diagonal support or distance as we get closer to the tip of the triangle. 
I personally bought a portion at 13.1K after that dip first, not the best I could've done but bought more at it dipped under 12K.
Edit: LOL Insta-downvoted, nice

You obviously didn’t read my post. That’s assuming you buy the same amount of BTC with a lower amount of fiat. In my example I’m keeping the fiat equal, actually read it. It would be an extra 600K+ because you would’ve accumulated 50 extra BTC using the same amount of fiat. Now try to tell me 600K isn’t a lot compared to the 100K you would have if you bought at the top.

It wasn’t hard to tell that we were in a parabolic curve when BTC hit 19K. Simple TA would’ve showed you that. Yes it can be hard but not in all cases.

Not sure what you’re getting at here? Are you saying Gemini is better than Coinbase or GDAX? Sounds like some shitty Gemini ad and I hate both exchanges.
