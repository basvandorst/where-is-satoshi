Some exchanges have variable fees and some apps allow you to reduce the fee you are willing to pay (at the expense of time for the transaction to clear - I have heard if is too low a fee it may never clear.) There are some sites out there that allow you to see the fees being paid and the amount of transactions clearing at that fee level. In general, I just pay the "normal" fee. I'm not doing a lot of trades so spending the extra time finding the lowest fee isn't worth it to me.
If you have a coinbase account the best place for you to trade between BTC and LTC and ETH would be gdax. Probably lowest fees and it is run by coinbase so you can transfer money to the exchange for free from your coinbase account.

Yes, there are fees every time you move bitcoin from one wallet address to another. A transaction is a transaction on the blockchain and it doesn't matter if the bitcoin moves between your wallet and the pizza man's or between your Coinbase wallet and your Blockchain wallet. Every transaction needs to be recorded in a block which requires a fee be paid to the miners.

Excellent! I'll check them out! Pretty sure I'm getting off this train soon. I don't see BTC or any crypto increasing any time soon. I said a while ago that we just entered the capitulation phase of the bubble and looks like I was right. I took my capital out long ago and was going to let the rest ride but I just don't see the point - everything is dropping so f-ing fast, it's going to stay down for a while. My guess, 1-2k for at least a year, and at that point, who knows, might just stay there or go down more!

Hey the chart looks just like one I saw earlier today... where did I see that... oh, that's right! It was the BTC chart on CMC today!

Wasn't physical access to the ledger required to pull off the hack? The article doesn't say if malware could cause the exploit (only that it possibly could). Also, would the exploit only work on devices that were not initialized? So, for my ledger, which I am confident has not been tampered with, and that I have already set up with my stored wallet words, if for some reason my wallet started giving me new wallet words I would know it has been compromised. Also, where does the PIN fit into all this? Does that essentially protect against this type of attack?
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:13:20
It was a joke.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:30:44
When? When will it increase in value? Right not I just see it going down, down, down! Next stop, 2k!
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:46:57
Well shit, it's all over now. Pack it up.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:35:54
Oh yeah.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:45:04
Hope you had a 12-20% markup on that because you immediately lost that much value today.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:39:37
"Expert" yeah, right. It's going to sub-5k, guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:29:42
Only one of these things has lost more than 60% of it's value in 3 months! I would rather have gold right now. Between this and facebook I've seen a lot of money go up in smoke over the last month. Thinking I'll just get out and keep what I have left from disappearing. Pretty sure BTC is going below 2k.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:38:14
It's cheaper than banks because it keeps dropping value like a red-headed step-child. Right now, banks are looking smart not getting into crypto. No end in sight to this free-fall!

The method is the same... but you need to unbox it first ;). Seriously though, first, set up your nano as you would have normally, then just follow the firmware update instructions. Make sure to write down your wallet words and your pin during your initial set-up!

King of value = gold. BTC is nothing but air right now. Until it shows it can do more than decrease in value. Nobody knows where the floor is at this point, it keeps breaking through every floor price that has been set. 10k is a distant memory at this point and it's looking like it will stay below 8k soon, then what, 5k? 2k? Some king of digital.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:41:45
At least one person found a way to unload their bag for gold. Wish I could sell some of this crap for gold at this point.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:32:12
Yeah, but at least it doesn't lose 60% of it's value in 3 months. And I guarantee you can find someone to buy it off you for what you paid for it the day before, not so with BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:44:05
Ah haaaa, lol. Yeah, I think the guy might have his CMC chart flipped. The line is going down, down, down genius.
