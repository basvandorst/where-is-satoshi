It's not necessarily as simple as what everyone's saying here. On 13th November when the koreans first pumped BCash, Bitcoin crashed. In hindsight it wasn't a big crash and yes it recocered quickly.
But it was still a crash. It was driven partly by fear, uncertainty and panic. And this is what makes it a crash. Not that it was fast or not the size but the driving factors.

That's a terrible comparison. You should be comparing like for like.

I'm assuming you mean English is not your native language? I feel the wording couldn't be any clearer in the article.

Who uses western union in 2018?
I do all my internationals with TransferWise. The fee for $4,000 USD to the Middle East would be $32 total.

I would go to a different cafe.

I use Bitcoin as a currency regularly and it's not good to use. Transactions on segwit usually take around 30 minutes but can take 10-50 minutes. Once they took over 2 hours. This isn't good at the minute.
I believe in Bitcoin but the transaction side of it needs improving.

Sure they are.

"HUGE FEES".
Like 1.3%. Are you fucking serious? That's not a huge fee. As a business owner I would rather pay 1.3% than have to count and reconcile cash after every shift.

Man I'm still waiting for my bpay to clear.

My mother thinks btc is a ponzi scheme.

If your coins are with coinbase there is 0% chance of that happening, disregard his comment.
And yes, you will have 0.05 b1x and 0.05 b2x and one of them will be called BTC.

I've waiting for $2k to clear since wednesday. It'll clear on Monday. The timing is certainly depressing.

You eat pieces of shitcoins for breakfast?
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:48:06
That's what I'm doing now. I just left with only my phone to buy breakfast.

Can't all of them purchase it online anyway?

Crypto is literally built on rules.

Steam uses your own computer. This is more like PlayStation Now where the games are hosted on their own servers and streamed to you.

I've never been dodgy but I've had my PayPal blocked on multiple occasions, and it's not straight forward to get it unblocked - it's a two week process where you have to submit data, fill out forms and make phone calls every day.

My plan has been to buy on 15th Feb (payday) for a while.
I pulled 75% of my money out of crypto into stocks right before most of the drop where's it's since made a tidy 0.74% return (which would amount to a whopping 8.88% annual return).
I'm so tempted to put it all back into crypto. Or at least a chunk.

I had no idea that "purchasing legal goods" was classified as "generous".

I was gonna buy it tonight, wanted to sit down and work out how much I can put in this month first.
But alas the dip has gone.

My point is that you can't group these things together.
To create a laymen's example: 100% of console sales are for Xbox, ^^^PlayStation ^^^and ^^^Nintendo.

If the money you put into Bitcoin you are willing to part with for several years, then no.
Everytime short term losses stab you in the face just think long term and relax.
@_date: 2019-05-09 08:32:20
You can't bet that - there's no end date.
