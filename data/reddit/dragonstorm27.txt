I've been running Bitcoin Core for a few years now, and unfortunately have run out of hard drive space on this computer. I'd like to uninstall it and clear up the hard drive space, but uninstalling it didn't clean up any hard drive space.
Any ideas on how to recover my HD space?
Edit: I figured it out. Found it under AppData/Bitcoin in the blocks folder. Deleted that and seemed to clear it up. Thanks all.

My extended family can't possibly know what I like, so, yes, they gift cash. Immediate family gifts gifts.

I believe the beta starts this Friday for exclusive testers only.

And here we have one of their brainwashed. No, Zenpool is not the most profitable in the world. Many other cloudminers are paying out well above Zenpool.
The Prime Hashlets were selling for about ~$46 earlier today before the site went down for maintenance. With the payouts that I've received, I'll stand to make either a little money or break even since I bought mine at $49.95, roughly. Not bad. No complaint there.
Buying hashstakers to stake the coin? Here, let us get more of your money to help you make more money....later! ...ringing any bells?
No, they won't give you a refund of what you paid. They'll probably offer to buy you out at lowest market value, since that's what they're doing in order to keep selling hashlets. They're literally buying the lowest cost hashlets on the marketplace and re-selling them at full price on their website.

The domain name was purchased by GAWMiners for $1M about 2-3 months back. They've since purchased another company, ZenPortal (not sure on old companies specific name), and have been investing all/most of their efforts into breaking into the Cloud Mining industry. Their services are a little different than others in that they offer Sha256 mining (in the form of genesis hashlets) and scrypt mining (in the form of other hashlets through a variety of pools). However, if you choose to go with their scrypt, your earnings every day are automatically converted to BTC. The maintenance fees are taken out in USD(which are based upon the USD/BTC rate at the time payouts are done each day, which varies from 9am-12:30pm CST). 
Anyway, they've also just ordered at least 10 petahash/sec from Bitmain and have been finishing up their new mining/data warehouse that they claim will consume 10MW-h of energy.
I guess we'll see where they decide to go from here, but I'm imagining cloud mining in a big way.

Ironically, he has very bad writing skills and typos/grammar mistakes are quite prevalent even among his posts on HashTalk. One of the mods has to go through and correct his grammar/typos every time he posts.

I've decided my long-term retirement plan is to buy Bitcoin with a portion of each paycheck... in 30 some years, each Bitcoin will be worth a million dollars, and I'll be thanking myself.

I get arbitration letters from you guys all the time about people defaulting, but no idea what to do with them to get any money out of it. I read them all the way through and was left even more confused than when I started.

He's trying to tell you that you threw in a lot of sensationalist info that really wasn't necessary.

I would have created a new bank account for that.

You're being downvoted because he said he does not want to link a bank account.
