Don't you think they tried different ways to SURVIVE ? ... 
I feel very sorry for them ... It is possible to make a system with like  a " sponsorship"  and donate to people who are in need ? And Maybe we can exchanging emails, conversations, etc etc... 
Maybe If people who donate are close to whom received them , they will be bigger growth in the donation "world" ?

I wanna do dis too... I currently have around 0.55 btc and trying to have ONE. Problem is , I have 4000$ Fiat left ( + Bills to pay , christmas and shit) , I bought like a fucktard at 10K range , 7.5K , 6.3K and my last was yesterday around 4.9K ... ( So average of 7.1K$/btc) I'm just waiting to 2.5K-3K so that I'll have only a maximum of 1250$ - 1500$ Left...   
But how can we be sure we won't be fucked up ? Is It worth to gamble for a digital currencies instead of Goods and paying bill ? I ask my self every day and I wish the best for y'all...

This nigga right. I am actually sitting in my office here in Brussels with a bunch of fucktard ( average age is 50 here). And most of them didn't heard ( even a bit ) of Bitcoin.Them motherfuckers only know the "Classic" Channel/way.All the other thang for them is Bullshit...
Btw I'm 26. And guess what ? I work For a "big" bank ( big in Belgium don't necessary mean big worldwide).
You really think my boss would allow me to have a meeting with a customer and suggest them BITCOIN as an asset to "gamble" ? Cuz yeah ... We gamble, we all gamble.... Banks, you , me ... What are we here for ? MONEY.
Money made on nothing but shit. But I have to admit that the bank ( with whom I don't identify myself) are better at this game than YOU ( and me) cuz they have more tools that allows them to make money on your back.
They Certainly not control Bitcoin.
What you see in this actual market is just a bunch of guys who are SUPER rich just playing game...hink otherwise, you play with 5000$ and you tell yourself that you ain't shit comparate to the "whales" ? But we are all the whales of someone !you can buy Houses with 5000$ in some country... then you have my boss who earn 4000€ a month ( worth +- 4600$).
So don't be a BITCH, you were aware of the risks.

Chill Tf out neegha I mention "Whales" to make a comparaison.   
And If you don't/want understand, let me write It again for you : *we are all the whales of someone.*  
Case dismissed
