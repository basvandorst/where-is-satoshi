How secure is this?

Thank you for the reply, I have already reached out to support with the details. Typically, how long has it taken for your transactions?

Thank you for the heads up of an alternative. Unfortunately it appears many of these giftcards are UK based companies.

Thanks for the replies everybody. I have an update, around 9:00 AM I received a confirmation email of my order... I asked the recipient if they received anything and they did with a 8:59 AM timestamp. So all in all, it took roughly 9 hours for the recipient to receive the $150 gc.

Did you send BTC to an address provided or did you click "Pay $xxx" via the Coinbase wallet?

This is called tax-evasion. This is a crime. This is illegal. Whether its 500 bitcoins or 20 bitcoins. Pay your damn taxes.

 This is not a fake post about a transaction being stuck 20+ Hours. Please do CENSOR it again Mods.

How does one do this? It seems somewhat complex

I should note the receiving address used was from my electrum desktop wallet (hardware wallet) but the program itself.

A short time later my Electrum wallet balance reflected "MyTrezor" balance.
So in other words I only need to be able to connect to "MyTrezor" to send and receive funds I don't need access to my "Electrum" on my PC? I notice both the MyTrezor and Electrum have the same "receiving keys" so is the Web Wallet just a display of my "Electrum" wallet?
If someone could clearify it would be greated appreciated.

Yes, I'm prompted for a pin. I have received the balance on my wallet as well. MyTrezor "web wallet" is essentially my electrum (hardware) wallet in web form. I don't need to have access to my electrum account to spend and receive if I can connect via MyTrezor with my Trezor hardware  wallet plugged in. I am correct in assuming this?
