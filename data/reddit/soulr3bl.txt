You'll need a lot more if we go SHA 1024

No he is not giving you any of his BTC.  Well maybe .000024 or something.

You made it? Are you a github committer on core, or a popular wallet or something?

Wait, I don't understand how this happened, exactly: 
To send BTC to your Electrum wallet, didn't you have to open it up, with its password, and get one of your generated addresses?

Well if he meant value in trade, you are correct. 
But -technically- if he meant value-in-use (or, utility... real value for applications), he is correct, those applications don't change very much year to year. For gold the two main ('real') applications outside of gold being a store of value, are currently digital circuits, and jewelry.  On the second, you could argue that, in the abstract, jewelry has little real value and is itself a store of value. So that value also therfore varies. 
But digital circuits provide a real practical use, and that value in use doesn't change very quickly, unless a new way to use gold in circuits or otherwise is discovered that wasn't there before.

Sure - first - note that comment ^ is an old meme, its a tongue-in-cheek comment. 
But my problem with the reasoning is the following - note that everything I'm writing here is still debated, and someone more versed in economics than I may surely dispute this, but: 
- The way I interpret the comment, the confiscation of bitcoin and/or gold by the government is justified and citizens should trade stores-of-value for fiat currency when the government demands so, to 'save' the economy. 
- In doing so, the comment presumes that persisting the gold standard, and attempting to manipulate the money supply through it, is beneficial for the economy, but, many economists argue that the gold standard exacerbated monetary contraction and deflation during the great depression
- Moreover, the government itself played a major role in worsening the great depression (i.e. Smoot Hawtley 1932) and the comment gives too much credit to the government's decision making capability during that time.  Simply put, the comment presumes that the Gov knows what to do with stores-of-value better than we do.

That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
