Markets don't always have to have good news to go up. Don't forget the incredible move up bitcoin made recently. Give it some room to correct. There is no asset that continuously just appriciates without a short term correction. We will experience new highs but the lows need to be revisited before we can do that. How do I know? 7 years trading traditional markets

Are you familiar on how this process works? Being approved to exchange currency? 
@_date: 2016-06-01 01:46:20
Ideally, I'm looking to do a basic currency exchange. I would like to handle each task manually until we are at a point of rebuilding/developing the necessary software to execute larger transactions. I'm trying to get the logistics of things and legality of it.  How regulated or unregulated is bitcoin to USD or vice versa transactions for example/ Also do you have skype?

Guess what Bitcoin has no problems. Instead of investing into some shitcoin why not just keep it for the original chain not a shitty fork

The beautiful thing about Bitcoin is it's all three, it can be collected and stored. Similar to a baseball card that appreciates, it can be sent and received without a forklift, and it can be used to process payments and build networks on top of the .
