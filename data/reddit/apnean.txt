Sort of the same at my place of work. I bought in at $180 and stashed them away, and played with them a bit too. I bought a book with btc way back. I better read it again cause its worth about $1600AUD+ now :) Anyway, I tried really hard to get some workmates and family to just buy 1 bitcoin and stash it away for a few years. The only one to actually do it was my Brother and he is happy as now. I have now ceased to speak about it at work cause people are people and the transference is palpable as bitcoin is now mainstream news non-stop here. I get asked how to get some and I just tell them to go Google it.

Bitcoin would need to be $1M each for a Satoshi to be 1 cent each. That[s a fair while before we have to worry about that problem. But, on that glorious day, if you need more than 8 decimals, you need to arrange a hardfork. Pretty sure a softfork won't do it. I heard that from a dev.

It will be more than a hundred years till the last fraction of the last bitcoin is mined. Regular halving has the reverse effect of regular doubling which is a huge effect either way. If bitcoin takes off way before that time, then there will be many times the amount of transactions per block required, therefore transaction fees will be THE major reward for miners, and the actual btc produced will be a mere side effect. No need to increase the total btc mined. This has been endlessly discussed here and elsewhere before.

OK, I found it and converted the text from a photo:
Blockchain a digital revolution
Like most areas of financial services, the trade space is being disrupted. I n trade, this is showing up in the emergence of new finacing structures, new technology providing more efficiency in trade processes like blockchain.
Australian companies are starting to come to grips with the digital innovation that has come to trade, says Neal Livingstone, Managing Director of Global Trade and Transaction Services, Institutional Banking and Markets, Commonwealth Bank.
“Trade finance is very document intensive business, but that is changing in through product innovation, such as the Bank Payment Obligation  (IPO), which is a new automated settlement product – and through digital and electronic innovation such as the much talked about eBill-bill-of-lading (EBI). These enable fully digitally documented transactions and its quite exciting” Livingstone says.
Financial technology is also stimulating change, he says. “The first bit of this is the connection of the traditional Bank-led-trade finance with the alternative investor space. To help achieve capital efficiency, structures and vehicles are being put in place to allow alternative investors to fund trade finance as a new asset class. This is partly a yield play but mostly a diversification play. In this way, the investors can get access to small-to medium-sized enterprise (SME) and mid-cap-type exposures that they don’t typically get in the institutional debt and credit markets”.
The other major innovation taking place is the emergence of "trade portals" through which SME businesses are buying and 
selling across borders. "Alibaba's Chinese and Asian business-to-business (B2B) portals are a great example," Livingston says. 
"The neat thing, from a trade finance perspective, is that these portals actually give visibility into the underlying cash flows, 
including the tenors, the risks, the payment record and so forth, attendant to those transactions. So the next piece in the value 
chain is trade finance, or supply-chain finance, that involves making an advance on the back of the settlement and is a natural 
adjunct to facilitating the transaction. "It is anticipated that you'll have peer-to- peer lenders participating in the portal, and 
willing to provide capital to fund certain supply-chain activities. 
in Europe right now, where investors can subscribe to the portal and are choosing the sectors and industries they want to support," he says.
 
Looming behind these developments, says Michael Eidel, executive general manager of Cashflow and Transaction Services, Institutional Banking and Markets, Commonwealth Bank, is blockchain — a distributed public ledger, peer-to-peer system enabling the verifiable transfer of digital assets. Eidel says blockchain has the potential to "completely revolutionise" trade by allowing 
value to be digitised, securely verified and stored, and transferred instantly from one party to another. "If you combine blockchain with the 'internet of things', the potential exists for even greater benefits for trade participants. For example, through the use of GPS data, you could automatically alert an issuing bank once a shipment arrives at any destination. And if we add sensory 
technology to that, we could have real-time monitoring of the condition of the delivered anywhere along its journey." 
That opens up the ability to introduce 'smart contracts', which involve more specific built-in parameters, Eidel says. 
"At the moment, trade contracts have some contingency because no-one exactly knows the condition of the goods when they are in transit and are handed over from one related party to the next along the delivery chain. If you can measure that throughout the journey, with the data stored centrally or blockchain, contracts can become much 
more specific and the costs to participants can come down significantly," he says. "Blockchain is going to have an amazing 
amount of uses. If we think of the trade finance space everyone that is party to the trade transaction — banks, exporters, importers, producers, the end user will have decentralised access to all contractual agreements, all identities, all documents through the blockchain. 
"So when you consider the comparative simplicity of using an integrated system that tracks transactions along the supply chain, 
and the associated cost reduction and ability for self-service for its participants, it is clear that blockchain has the potential to 
fundamentally change the business model of global trade," Eidel says.

Been using and understanding the interweb since its inception.
Not saying I'm some kinda guru, but I understand more than some script kiddy who hacks game accounts and so on.
One thing I do understand is that if the rest of the world NEEDS the internet, it will not let the ultimate corruption of the USA deprive it from them.
It would re-incarnate from other centres in time, and not a long time at that. I know that the NSA loves the fact that most of the Worlds net traffic gets routed through the US, but this is just a default system that has just been allowed to evolve, and was not really designed with too much forethought.
Tell me how exactly the internet would NOT be re-incarnated after calamity in the US.
It grew from a University / DoD project in the US, to become a world wide phenomenon, but that genie, just like the bitcoin protocol, is well and truly out of the bottle.
The rest of the world is not about to allow a defunct USA hold the world by the short and curlies to that extent.
A calamity for sure, but not forever dude. However the internet is rebuilt after your Smaug event, it will be a sturdier beast for sure.

There was a time only a few years a go where virtually no-one owned or knew of btc, but that has changed.
When Silk Road 1.0 was set up, users went out and specifically learnt about/used btc just to use the site for the advantages it provided, illegal and otherwise.
Why should same not apply to OB, which would seem to hold much more promise?
Do you have some vested interest in a current version of Silk Road or other online drug bazaar? They are in the firing line as well now once OB is up and running.

Just another thought - current opinions seem to think that the spending of btc causes the price to fall, as vendors immediatly cash out the btc they receive.
I think a fair percentage of OpenBazzar vendors may actually keep some btc in-hand as they spend their btc on for other stuff/supplies within the market, or just as a way to stay off the grid as far as the taxman and law enforcement is concerned.

If there is no real alternative, companies will behave as they always do, and that is to find more marginal ways and means to squeeze revenue out of the market (us) to pay dividends, and its only going to be one way.

The sale took place last month via BitPremier, a website calling itself "the bitcoin luxury marketplace". Sellers list properties and other goods on the site, which prices them in bitcoins as well as traditional currencies. When an item sells, the site takes 5 per cent commission, paid in bitcoins. The villa's buyer was an "early bitcoin adopter" who wants to remain anonymous, said Alan Silbert, chief executive of BitPremier.
Ronny Tome, the German developer who listed the unfinished property, described the buyer as "an early miner", referring to the computer process of generating bitcoins.
Neither Mr Tome nor Mr Silbert would disclose the exact price of the villa in dollars or bitcoins, saying only that it sold for the equivalent of more than $US500,000 ($554,300).
The Balinese villa is BitPremier's first real estate sale, and the site's biggest sale, "by a large margin" since the company started in May last year.

If they missed even 1 bitcoin spread around the place, that amount of btc could then be subdidvided to a few more decimal places and the wheel keeps turning.
And they would have to keep doing it till 2140 as more and more btc are mined into existence. Good luck with that.

I think that a lot of the Vendors currently selling on Ebay will also sell the same goods on OB, just to expand their customer base and revenue stream. In this fashion there may be quite a cross-over of customers from Ebay to OB.
I mean, if you are buying Alpaca sock for $20 on Ebay, and the same vendor sells the same socks on OB for $17 because they save fees there - thats a WTF moment for the customer right there.

Hard to foresee the future, but if the block size were to effectively increase in size to match Cash user facility needed to match Fiat, would not the fees collected at the current fee size be much greater if mass adoption increased? And if mass adoption DID occur. the Block reward in BTC would be commensurately larger due to increased value imputed into the btc itself. Thats a double happy for the miners right there given a larger adoption rate for btc. Even when future miners are competing for small fractions of btc, would it not be profitable on both fronts if btc value has increased? Just a very basic shower thought I know.

Lets see: The year 2140 (ish) when the final fraction of a bitcoin is mined - if bitcoin is still a thing - will see electricity generation coming from elsewhere than expensive fossil fuels. Most likely fusion. The hashrate will be enormous.
Bitcoin would be worth 10's of millions, but will money still even be a thing?
Humans won't have much to do due to automation.
Consumerism like it is today? - not likely.
Material 'things' including food will be in abundance if we don't screw things up.

With these things and other factors in mind, I think the question is meaningless. The last minute fraction of a bitcoin may never be mined.

'The irony, of course, is that the Bitcoin community will never pose a serious threat to the global financial establishment if it continues to behave this way. Successful movements need pragmatic leadership, which inevitably means allowing some people to negotiate compromises that move the community forward. There is a real danger that the deeper divisions within the Bitcoin community will permanently hinder the growth of the platform.'

I have posted about this issue before. This link is the latest where the game manager has had ALL other payment options taken from him due to his geographical location in Turkey. Apparently there is some law there that states that if you don't have a physical Office in that country, you cannot do business there.
I used to do Skrill 'donations' as I could fill that with btc no probs. That got taken from him and it was the last resort.
Since then, I have been doing some in-game education of the reluctant player base, with some success, and awareness of bitcoin has grown out of necessity. I think this might actually be the only online game that survive only on bitcoin donations now!
That says something - the only form of payment available after everything else failed.
EDIT: As a result of a suggestion by another redditor, The game Manager is going to implement some in-game tournaments with small bitcoin prizes, as a means of educating the player base.

Fee competition might be a thing now that the spam has stopped.
If the business transactions you speak of are from your own wallet, on your own device, just make sure they are segwit tx.

No, my friend - you don't understand that these guys are saying that btc is an important hedge NOW. 'IMPORTANT' means 100's of Billions of dollars/pounds/whatever. It is certainly a nice hedge for a bunch of people but not for the big players. THEY are the ones stuck with old habits.

What do you mean by "friend"? Sounds like it was some kind of "associate" to me.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:14:56
They were not 'by all accounts" idiots. All or most of them had tertiary educations "by all accounts". 
They would not have had to take on everyone on the plane either. Just the ones that could get them to the cockpit while most of the passengers were unaware. Perhaps a handful at most. Back there in cattle class, they would not have had a clue what was going on up front. Once locked in the cockpit - 'plane' sailing. Very simple in the end really.

I do believe that the hijackers, who were trained pilots by the way, did do that. Rather than believe that CIA operatives sacrificed themselves to do it or some other BS, because in the end, the planes did deviate, then did fly into the twin towers. What exactly is your narrative as to how it was achieved? Remote control, or trained monkeys?

You said it yourself - "flight school flunkies". They had flight and simulator training and that was well documented. You can not have missed all of that surely? They did not have to know how to take off or land, just how to navigate the thing to the twin towers and aim the planes at them. The end.
Box cutters are very effective weapons against unarmed flight personnel and passengers too. You go face off with a maniac with a knife in his hands - its harrowing. I know this from experience.

I am Australian and well aware of the situation.
He is not average Chinese - Educated/Money. Who knows how long he is staying, but he is here now.
My main point is that he used btc to move Yuan from China to another country, and converted it at the same time.
I do know he was looking to buy a house or a Unit, but with Fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:49:55

@_date: 2013-12-12 23:41:07
You may have a point, but can you go recruit users from the general populace and not us. The truth so far is that most alt. cryptocurrencies are still only available by trading for BTC, or other alt currencies.
EG: try to buy Quark coins with cash and see how hard that is.

My other point with this post is:
Maybe some of the BTC now on-hand with a lot of Chinese dudes who are at a loss what to do with it now, are selling it internally to guys like this who, for whatever reason - are looking to move yuan somewhere else into other currencies somewhat easier than traditional pathways.

He is not my friend.
I think he arrived some days ago, maybe even a week or so.
I met his through my work on a professional basis only.
He is well educated and speaks English, so he is not representational of the average Chinese citizen that's for sure.
He just used btc to move a lot of money out of China, which may have been difficult for him otherwise.
That is all. I will not be mentioning his name that's for sure

What I was saying is that he moved his worth from China using btc, and then HE moved on as well to the country of his choice, with $$$ waiting for him on arrival.
I suppose he could just as easily bought it with him on a usb or paper wallet. But he chose to do it this way for some reason.

BTC has to hit high levels in order to be successful in the medium to long term.
If they just stayed at a low $$ value, like, oh lets say $31.00 per bitcoin for instance, then they are largely useless for anyone wanting to conduct a large fiat transfer, or to buy a high priced item like a house or business or something.
Just too damn hard to accumulate the numbers.
High value = success. That goes for anything really.
