I know your strategy. You will really give this away so mainstream media hears about it and the price and reputation of bitcoin increases. Then you can make other giveaways so more people get into the this wonderful Blockchain technology to be the new lucky one. You're very smart. If you succeed, you'll be remembered as much as Satoshi. Not just because of the giveaway, but because you would have truly given a stab in banks hearts. Bitcoin will get lots of publicity while the global economy starts to collapse because of a new banking and financial crisis.
I hate banks. In my country Colombia they control everything.
