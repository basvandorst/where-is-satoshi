Very good question. 
I have no idea. 
I want for nothing already. I've had a $200 gift card on Amazon for months because I can't think of anything to buy. Everything I own is second hand and can be sold for a profit. 
Perhaps I'm waiting to process it completely. It's all been too fast. I also don't really trust any of the exchanges with large amounts. 
I want to see where it all heads as I really don't think we've even begun to glimpse what all this entails. Maybe I'll feel more vindicated or satisfied when my holdings are a really silly telephone number. 
Anyone with a few grand's worth now will be feeling the same in a few years. 
Perhaps also I'm psychologically conditioned for another couple of bear markets before I feel that I fully own the situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:06:52
If the numbers get silly enough it'll all become pretty academic. $5-10 million plus 21 or 2.1 BTC to hang on to forever would surely be enough for almost anyone. 
You need to reach the academic level first and then it'll feel a lot more objective.

There you go. That's more money than 99.7% of the human race will ever have access to in their entire lives, but assuming you're in a first ish world country that's not quite *it* yet.

@_date: 2017-12-11 23:49:59
There is a simple solution to this. 
Sit down and calculate the cost of your every possible desire and expense. 
Price it up in USD. When you reach that USD amount and you can keep half your crypto or whatever proportion you think is prudent, say if you have 100 BTC now, 21 BTC will be an insane amount in the far future, sell enough to meet that USD amount when the moment arrives. 
If you're having pangs or doubts it's clearly not the right amount. If it is you won't give a second thought. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:11
Of course it would suck, but equally it doesn't really feel all that real. This year has felt very strange watching all the prices go up. I add up the numbers and laugh. 
I wasn't prepared for it and have no sell plan. Maybe I should've but I don't feel ready. 
Nothing would change in my life if it fell. It would've been a fun feeling while it lasted. It's not as if I earned it. It was just good judgement and timing. 
I will of course sell some at some point, but we're nowhere near reaching its potential and I'd much prefer to spend it directly.

Right now I am paper rich because of crypto, but I haven't sold any so it could disappear again. If I sold right now it would be a few million dollars. 
Most of my life I haven't had much money. Because of that I trained myself out of wanting any material possessions or expensive habits. 
That hasn't changed. I bought a couple of expensive things recently but sent them back when I realised I didn't really want them. 
I'm going to continue as normal but I'll continue with the knowledge that I'll never have to worry about affording to stay alive again. 
If it goes up another 10x I'll sell and give most of it away. Anything beyond enough for a house and about $1000 a week in current buying power for the rest of my days is unnecessary.

Coinbase isn't an exchange. Buttercoin is. 
Whether you bother with exchanges at all depends on whether you want to trade BTC or just keep it. 
As Buttercoin is so new it might take a while before they have enough volume on there to make it a realistic option. 
If you want to buy more then Coinbase or Circle will do just fine, just make sure you're in control of your own coins after you buy them. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 11:24:35
Once upon a time almost all price action took place on Gox. 
Nowadays there are exchanges all over the place, there are more appealing p2p options to buy, proper players will never go near the current exchanges, Coinbase and Bitpay are probably doing deals off market. 
The majority who are left on the exchanges either don't want to buy or don't want to sell, so we're left with a handful of people with large amounts of coins batting the price around as they wish. 
It's up to whomever to provide an exchange that's transparent, rock solid and is guaranteed not to rape the public. There's a lot of trust that needs earning again. I can't foresee a significant price rise until something like that's in place.

Any altcoin starting out needs a few things to stand out and establish itself. 
1 - community 
2 - publicity
3 - passion
Dogecoin right now has all three covered pretty well. 
Bitcoin will always be the daddy but the community often leaves a pretty nasty taste in the mouth. 
Litecoin has gone places but it feels sterile and rudderless in comparison to Dogecoin at present. 
So far Dogecoin isn't a speculation vehicle or a vessel for everyone's odious political leanings, it's simply being *used*. That's kind of the whole point of such a thing.

BTC China was strangled initially by the deposit thing and then more comprehensively by imposing the trading fee. 
Huobi's volume might be fictitious, it's more certainly down to thousands of bots selling each other the same coins over and over again because it's free. 
If the government wanted to really put a lid on things they'd make trading fees mandatory or open their own exchange and force everyone to use it. Not gonna happen of course but at least it would make things more certain for once.

For me there's enough brain power, investment and press to believe that Bitcoin will carry on growing. 
It would've been easy to think it was going nowhere a couple of years ago but now it's on enough radars in the wider world. 
Mining will be too expensive and too iffy. You'd need to spend thousands on a specialist machine with no guarantee of a delivery date. Use what you have to mine another coin and convert to BTC. 
You need to figure out what works for you. I've put in more than I should but no one got anywhere without taking a few risks and it's one I have faith in.

Bittylicious is sometimes cheaper. Overall you don't have too many options for proper market prices unless you're willing to send money to an exchange.

Coinbase has a very good reputation if you're in the US. You'll have to wait to get verified and send money via bank transfer. 
You can find someone to buy in cash at a Bitcoin meet somewhere or via localbitcoins. You might end up paying a large premium for cash. 
Blockchain.info is used by loads of people. Set up two factor authorisation for logging in and the email you use for it. They send you a wallet backup file with your private keys so even if they disappear you'll be able to insert it into another program.

A friend of mine was with his wife for sixteen years since their late teens. They seemed very close, had a daughter. He lost his job and had a slight (non violent) funny turn. 
Instead of supporting him, she did everything within her power to have him erased from her and their daughter's life. She attacked him, he got a criminal record for it. 
After four years and $60,000 in legal fees he's just been 'permitted' to see his daughter again. 
I don't blame her for not being able to handle his falling apart. I don't see why she had to systematically destroy him with every single angle she could think up for several years afterwards when he was already long gone. 
This was a couple who'd trusted each other for nearly half their lives. You never know what'll set someone off and you can never truly know another person. 
I've seen it in the eyes of womanfriends who were done with me. They would've been totally indifferent if I'd dropped dead in front of them so trying to drain every last penny isn't going to trouble their conscience. 
It's always struck me as totally berserk that someone would stake their financial future and their shelter on the feelings that another person has for you, but I've always been ruled by my head rather than those other two vital organs.  
And yes I am from multiple broken homes and there's no way in hell I'll ever marry someone.

It seems a lot of people are being turned off by Bitstamp's KYC requirements. They're asking for tax documentation in certain cases. I've never heard of any other company asking that shit. 
There's no way I'd supply that info so it's another exchange for me. Unless they tone it down they'll have a mass exodus to exchanges who operate in a sane manner.

Bitcoin for day to day transactions is very appealing to the merchant, less so for the buyer unless they already have a ton. It'll be down to the merchants to make it a more appealing proposition. 
I also don't think enough thought has been given to the 'unbanked' side of things. There's an awful lot of people who can't get credit/ debit cards, bank accounts with transfer capabilities etc who could instantly slot into online commerce if they managed to obtain/ earn some coins. That's potentially hundreds of millions of people. 
Perhaps its future lies as a commodity, store and transfer of value and backer of a more lightweight currency. We shall see.

Any big player would stay well away from the exchanges. They're far too creaky, untrustworthy and illiquid. 
They would buy directly off exchange from miners or holders with large amounts. I think SecondMarket has deals with miners to buy coins as soon as they're mined.

The problem with selling and buying back is that you have to leave money and/or coins on an exchange. If you take fiat out then it's several days before it can get back in. 
Things can change very rapidly. I decided I couldn't predict the market well enough to bother with that.

Depends which year it is. 
The most valuable is the 2011 error coin. This one has 'casacius' rather than casascius written repeatedly on the hologram on the back. 
These can go for up to 4-7 BTC if really mint. 
Non error coins still sell for over 1 BTC. 
Look into selling here  rather than Ebay and make sure you use escrow because people will try to steal it from you. 
When to sell depends on whether you want BTC or regular money. If you want BTC then if it gets really high then the premiums will have to come down. Selling now makes sense.

For that amount the premium on Localbitcoins is going to add up to a full coin or more most likely.

Localbitcoins. 
If you're buying relatively small amounts then any premium it has will probably even out compared to most exchanges.

@_date: 2014-04-10 23:46:12
It makes more sense to ride the trends. The current one is still down and no one can tell you where it'll end. 
I'd be buying once I've seen a reasonably sustained level of confidence returning. It might mean a few more dollars per coin. I'd still prefer to pay $270 after it hit $250 for several days or something rather than buying now when it's still up in the air. It's a premium worth paying. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 23:42:52
It changes constantly. Sometimes it's been within £5, other times it's been £30 or more. That's why you gotta keep an eye on it. 
My one attempt with Bitstamp took over a week to arrive and cost me rather a lot because of rising prices. I prefer to swallow a small premium and get the coins at the price of the moment. 
Right now the cheapest localbitcoins price is £408. Bitstamp is $675. Natwest dollar rate is £411 at that price. Localbitcoins is cheaper right now.

It's still ridiculously early days and an awful lot could happen in either direction. 
It'll never go away. Even if every single authority on planet Earth goes all out to destroy it, it'll still hum away underground and there'll be a core people willing to use it as a medium of exchange. 
Instead of coming out on top from minute one, perhaps it would be stronger if it emerged from the shadows with an upswell of common support. It would then be truly too big to fail. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 14:08:42
Bitcoin's current price is almost all speculation. It could remain priced where it is if the speculative money falls away and adoption/ utility catches up. 
That's pretty darned unlikely as I'd guess only low hundreds of thousands of committed enthusiasts have any of them and the real speculators, let alone the average person, are yet to arrive in this market. When they do then minds are likely to be blown. 
The wild variances in estimations are probably down to what differing people think it will become. There are some who are thinking it's gold 2.0. Others who think it's effectively just another payment processor. 
If it was explicitly one thing with one function it would be a lot easier to estimate but it could be many more things that no one has even thought of yet. We've truly only just begun.

At this point in time my feeling is that it would be more sensible to spread your buys. 
Even though the Chinese situation is clarified people are still very panicky about it. I dunno why. 
Manipulators will be able to play on those fears and throw the price around a fair bit until the dust has properly settled. It'll be lower than here and higher than here. 
There'll be plenty of good news to come and plenty of bad news. Right now no one seems to have a strong feeling what the short term direction is.

The market cap is a pretty shaky measure of anything. It's just the current price added to the amount of coins mined and nowhere near the money actually poured in. 
It would require a big chunk of change for the price to rise tenfold or more, but it would be fractions of the market cap.

It depends on whether you're planning on inputting or withdrawing USD. 
If you are then their fees are pretty enormous. 
If you're inputting coins for more coins then look into places like OKcoin. Much bigger markets, if they're real, and the fees are tiny or non existent. 
BTC-e has always been solid for me but its only selling point is anonymity and you pay a high price for it.

People can't withdraw money from Chinese Bitcoin exchanges with third party payment processors from that date. 
The exchanges have come up with workarounds but some are a bit tenuous. China is still the largest market by quite a long way. 
When it was announced a few weeks back the price fell sharply. If there hadn't been this announcement it's possible the price might've carried on upwards. 
Some think it's now been priced in and there won't be a fall on the 31st. Any Chinese news makes people very panicky. I expect manipulators to try and start a panic to get cheaper coins. 
It's sown a lot of doubt in the midst of some amazing news so maybe that's why the markets have been steady/ uncertain. Once it's been and gone then we might see where the true value lies at the moment.

The older a coin is and the longer it's been dormant, the greater the number of days destroyed is when it does move.

With Bitcoin you're talking money, very large amounts of it in some cases. That's going to make people more conservative. 
I think there is a case to be made that Bitcoin has plenty of flaws. It's also 'good enough' right now, has first mover advantage and could incorporate changes that will become necessary.

People involved in Bitcoin since earlier days have been here plenty of times before and through much more alarming developments than the same old shit about China. 
They also lived through periods where there weren't hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into infrastructure, tens of thousands of super bright people beavering away on various projects and authorities starting to make actual provisions for sustainable markets and legal status. 
Look beyond a few weeks or months at the wider picture.  
Read sentiments around the 2011 slump. Many folks really did think it was over. Back then all you could do with Bitcoin was buy a few socks and a handful of other odds and ends. Almost every bit of whatever infrastructure there was back then was operated by anonymous thieving scum. Today is a radically different picture.

It's quite possible. It doesn't take much to drop again. I think people will be watching carefully around the 31st and manipulators might play on that. 
I've taken the view that if it does take off properly then the initial buying cost will be a drop in the ocean. 
Obviously you want to get as many coins as you can so the price is important. Equally you don't want to get left behind if it goes berserk and this year might well be the tipping point.

The current trend might continue for months as they have in the past. 
No one can really know where the value stands in terms of utility versus speculation. 
I'd say that utility is catching up pretty quickly and it's far more usable in a way that it wasn't even three months ago. Every new merchant increases legitimacy. 
I think we'll need to see certain things happen before $2000 looks likely. Buying, selling, securing and using them will need to become easier and perhaps some consensus will need to be reached on moving a few decimal places around.  
All of the above will happen faster than we expect. 
It might be next month. It might be next year. As a pure guess I'll go for $2000 within 5-7 months.

People seem to be trying to convince themselves that it's priced in but sellers are very, very jittery still. Falls, albeit small ones, are happening for the most piffling reasons on anything that smells Chinese.

There's only a small fraction of coins for sale at any one time. I think on the exchanges it's only tens of thousands. 
Assuming that most coins stayed dormant, which I'm guessing may not be the case, it would only take a relatively modest amount (in global terms) to push it into the tens or hundreds of thousands. 
I've read a few analyses that reckon 250 billion of investment would push the price to $80,000 per coin with similar market conditions. 
Many Bitcoins will have been lost. Many would cash out a reasonable amount on the way up and await even more heady prices. It may be the most deflationary event of all time.

Look into the meaning behind this word - decentralised.

It's as safe as you choose to make it. 
You can have 2FA and the keys backed up offline and a second sending password. 
If you don't have 2FA and there's a keylogger on the machine you use to log in with then you've got problems. 
It's not going to protect you if your end is compromised so you need to practice careful computer safety.

Are you in the UK? If not then it's difficult to realise how weedy the Bitcoin scene is compared to other developed countries. 
There's no exchange and I'm not sure there's one documented case of a BTC business being able to keep a business bank account going for any period of time without lying to their bank. 
I presume they got those figures off Bitcoin QT downloads. It would be interesting to see the ratio of times downloaded versus actually being activated.

They don't in general. In this particular case they'll look to do that. 
I can't foresee a liquidator groaning behind a computer for three solid months as they drip feed 1-2000 coins a day through a shaky exchange in a far off land with the price exploding up or down by the second, only to be told that they have to be reverified or the money has been lost at the end of it. 
There were plenty of folks publicly offering to buy the Silk Road coins in one deal. This'll be the same.

It's possible that many who hold Bitcoin don't have experience in other markets, and there is no other market like it. 
It's not that established, it's still experimental and it's still a big risk where no one can tell you where it'll end up.

They devote trillions to farting around with access to oil and a pointless war on drugs. Does anyone think they'll sit on the shore and wave as the root of all their power sails away?
I can see two scenarios. 
1 - bitcoin is allowed to flourish. It's taxed like everything else. It creates new industries and prosperity and its useful qualities endure. 
2 - Governments do everything within their power to erase Bitcoin. It will survive on the fringes. It won't be worth shit and no one other than the faithful will accept it.

You're not going to have much luck with Paypal or a credit card. It'll have to be cash or bank transfer all the way.

Depends on how much you want to buy. 
If you're in the UK I think Speedybitcoin and Bittylicious allow you to buy small amounts without much or any verification. 
Kraken also has levels of verification depending on amounts.

If they're dead set on obtaining those gains the alternative would be to ban any transaction other than a BTC/USD conversion which really would finish off any normal commerce.

That will change as proper players get involved. Right now the best place to park coins is you and always has been.

Doegcoin has momentum right now and that counts. In the immediate future I'd guess that it has way, way more room for movement, up or down, than Bitcoin. 
If I were you I'd hedge my bets and buy perhaps 0.1 or so BTC right now, keep on mining and see what the Doge price gets up to. 
There's a ton of other coins worth looking into as well. If you get in on the bottom floor with new ones and transfer them into BTC when you've hit the figure you want, it won't matter whether they implode further down the road. This'll keep rinsing and repeating for a long time yet. 
Mooncoins went from a $30,000 market cap to hundreds of thousands in one day last week. 
Bitcoin is barely out of the blocks in the wider world. There's still a giant potential upside to its price. That said there may be much more money to be made cynically milking altcoin after altcoin.

An exchange should purely be used as a place to obtain or sell coins, never, ever storage. I'm sure legit exchange operators would prefer it that way too.

Bitstamp is Bitcoin only, no altcoins other than Ripple. It's currently the most stable and relatively transparent exchange.
As we've seen that can change rapidly. Lots of people rate BTC-e and that does have altcoins but absolutely nothing is known about who runs the site. 
Kraken.com is rated too. It has more advanced trading features but much lower volume compared to Bitstamp right now. 
It depends on what you want to do. If you only want to buy you have more options like localbitcoins or bittylicious. If you want to try day trading Bitcoin then Bitstamp is your best bet.

To really go places Litecoin needs to demonstrate more infrastructure and adoption in the wider world. Just being 'not Bitcoin' isn't compelling enough. 
To be a haven from Bitcoin it would need to be detached from its fortunes. That's nowhere near happening. If it does then it's going to start making serious sense.

I'll guess that most bitcoin holders have never dabbled in other markets and are definitely not hardened traders.

I've absolutely no idea but there are many, many coins chased by collectors that ceased being any type of usable currency an awful long time ago. 
Think of it this way - crypto currencies are an idea that won't go away. Bitcoin was the first. Casascius coins were the first physical representation used in the media everywhere. They're already collector's items even at this early stage. 
Many of these have been redeemed or damaged or they won't have any docs to prove they're a real one. That reduces the number even more. 
Even if Bitcoin dies they're still going be very desirable. Having all your Bitcoin in Casascius coins would have been a sensible hedge when they were affordable. Time will tell. 
And if Casascius starts to make 'tribute' coins if Bitcoin dies, that still makes the originals, well, original. The little noodly differences are what makes or breaks values.

Half your savings is not wise.
10-100x its current value is possible. There's only a few hundred thousand people who own a significant amount right now. 
There are only 0.1-0.5% of coins for sale at any one time so it wouldn't take an insane amount of expenditure to get considerably higher. 
It should be regarded as a multi year deal. The easy money is over. Now it's out in the open it's going to have many more battles to overcome. 
Every battle it wins will make it stronger and more entrenched. It's taken every beating thrown at it and still sprung up. This is why I think it won't be usurped for a long time to come. 
People who make myspace/facebook comparisons are tripping. Those are platforms that you skip between with zero impact on your life. People aren't going to dump Bitcoin when there's a ton of money on the line. Bitcoin can evolve and take on some of the best features of other coins. 
There's much more money to be made in altcoins as long as you ride them short term. They are the purest bubble IMO. Most will come and go while bitcoin chugs onwards.

A bona fide Bitcoin offshoot is the Distributed Autonomous Corporation. 
They'll be companies that don't need any human interaction at all once they're up and running. 
Distributed Autonomous Corporations have many advantages.  DACs are...
Corporations – They are, and of a right ought to be, free and independent persons.
Autonomous – once up to speed; they no longer need (or heed) their creators.
Distributed – there are no central points of control or failure that can be attacked.
Transparent – their books and business rules are auditable by all.
Confidential – customer information is securely (and incorruptibly) protected.
Trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on trust.
Fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and shareholders’ interests.
Self-regulating – they obey their own rules like, well, robots.
Incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive influence over them.
Sovereign – over their digital resources.  They don’t need governments to exist.

When investors have poured tens of millions into infrastructure and regular folks have poured tens or hundreds of millions into buying some actual coins, 'good enough' becomes a rather powerful incentive to make your existing investment work. 
There'll always be newer and sexier developments. Perhaps Bitcoin can incorporate most of them. Regardless of that  people en masse have to settle on what they're going to award value to otherwise it'll all fade away.

There's only a few thousand coins for sale at any one time on the open market and they're the coins that set the price. No one knows what's been spent in total so far on bitcoins but it's probably a pretty modest amount. 
The market cap is just the number of coins mined in total glued to the current price. It's nothing to do with the money put in. 
If someone arrived at Bitstamp with a billion dollars and started hitting buy, not that they'd be stupid enough to buy that way, it would drive the price absolutely insane as the few coins there would rapidly run out and people would up their selling prices. 
I've read that $250 billion spent on coins would push the price to around $80-90,000. I'm guessing big money will go into infrastructure rather than ownership. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:10:44
I don't know how you'd plan to empty your paper wallets eventually, but if you use blockchain.info (which I do) it gives you two options when it comes to moving money from a paper wallet into it - sweep or import. 
Sweeping has less exposure of private keys. It's also a much better idea to completely empty a paper wallet in one transaction instead of sending a part of it. 
If you don't there's a risk of the change address problem so make sure you don't want to take out a portion of what you put in in the future. All or nothing per address will save heartache.

It's not investing at the moment. It's not gambling either. I'd class it as speculating. 
Altcoins are a different matter. The only way to buy them is usually by exchanging Bitcoins for them. 
They'll be tied to Bitcoin prices for a long time to come, perhaps always. 
Altcoin markets are far more open to being manipulated by relatively tiny groups of people. Bitcoin is too but perhaps that'll fade as it grows larger. 
It if were me I'd keep most of my money in Bitcoin. I'm happy to take the risk. I'd put a small fraction into altcoins, 5% or less. If any of them do explode then you get a nice payday without much risk.

The longer a bitcoin has been in its wallet without moving anywhere, the higher the number of days destroyed is. So a coin which hasn't moved since 2010 will count as a much higher number than one that hasn't moved for a week. 
It could either mean that lots of very recently transacted coins have been moved, or a smaller number of parked coins from long ago have moved. 
People often take it as a signal that long term holders are selling. They may of course just be moving them around for other reasons too.

Here's a quote about it. It's probably closer than we think. 
“Today computers -- and, therefore, the Internet -- are almost wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes (a petabyte is 1,024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet were first captured and created by human beings by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code. 
The problem is, people have limited time, attention and accuracy -- all of which means they are not very good at capturing data about things in the real world. If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things -- using data they gathered without any help from us -- we would be able to track and count everything and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling and whether they were fresh or past their best.”

I've done it a few times now. It's very easy via just-dice but you can also do it via other sites like yacuna.com.
It was done this way to create a fairly distributed currency. It's pretty unique. 
You do have to give up your private keys to claim them so only use an empty and dead wallet which is what I did. I cleared them and then claimed the clams. 
Poloniex is the best place to sell if you don't intend to keep them. The whole process was over in about 20 minutes from claiming the clams to having the sold BTC sent to a new wallet.

There's no point comparing BTC to stocks or forex. They're markets of the present. 
BTC is still a market finding its future and there's a long way to go before we know whether it'll find a place in the world. That's what sustains bullish sentiment. It's all still to play for. 
The price could be horrible and there'd still be a ton of bulls because so much is happening so quickly beyond a bunch of exchanges, most of which are rigged or completely fictional. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:55:38
Not totally sure. 
When you divorce you're legally obligated to declare all of your assets. That includes cars, pensions, gold.
There's zero reason why BTC would be exempt and just because you bought it for a comparative pittance ain't going to mean it's all yours to keep. 
I assume you have to transfer ownership or liquidate those assets if they're not divisible. 
If you didn't tell anyone about your BTC stash and managed to buy it without leaving a paper trail regarding purchases then I'm sure you could get away with it. 
You could be nailed to the wall at any moment if anyone found out.

Processing money and creating a new type of it are a universe apart. 
None of those businesses are geared up for anything like that and I can't imagine they have any appetite for it. 
Processing is an ongoing cash cow. Creating opens up an uncharted world of pain. 
Every digital currency project by the bigwigs so far has been nothing more than cleverer ways to make regular currency spendable or turning it into redeemable tokens like mintchip or the Ecuadorian effort which were both government initiatives, not business. I can't see that changing.

I put in $19000 over the last few weeks. It worked out at an average of about $400 per coin. The average would've been much less but for Bitstamp taking ages to accept a deposit and some hesitation. 
I'm probably done buying any more coins unless they get below $350 or so again. There ain't no profit until I sell or transact them. I'll wait for a few more orders of magnitude upwards before that happens. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:27:54
If my dear old mother tried to obtain and retain some bitcoins she'd probably have an explosive stroke. It's still astoundingly clunky. 
To people who've been involved for ages it probably feels like second nature. The average person would run screaming within a few minutes of study. 
It's still a whole load easier to comprehend than Ripple though.

I'm sure there are and will be plenty of ways to operate under the radar. And the institutional investors who eventually hop on board will no doubt find all of them. 
I for one would rather be coughing up and not have to duck and dive to enjoy my gains.
The taxation as it stands sucks but it could be a whole lot worse compared to much of the world and it isn't going anywhere soon. 
VAT, for me at least, would push it from being a necessary evil to a total pisstake so this outcome is satisfying enough for me.

It never has in the long term. I assume the OP is talking short term so they can buy back in for less at the vital moment.

I've bought a couple of times on Ebay without any problems. It is risky though and any seller with half a brain would insist on bank transfer or cash only. You were lucky to find one who accepts paypal. 
Ebay can also attract some totally insane premiums. Your best bet is localbitcoins. There's a premium but it's usually not too stupid and it can be as fast as you want it to be. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:23:32
Kraken was very quick for me as well. It's a young site but is growing. 
I've used Bitstamp. That took an age and there's an extra layer of converting when their bank turns the Euros you've sent into dollars. 
Bitcoin.de could also be an option.

If you're a believer in the concept then 100 or 200 dollars above whatever low may come will feel like less than chickenfeed in the years to come. 
If you're looking to double or triple some money in the coming weeks then you'd need to study things carefully. I don't trust my judgment enough for that. 
I bought for the long haul. The most annoying aspect of a Bitcoin downswing is not being able to time it well enough to double or triple your holdings. That's what I'm feeling right now. I'm glad to have some at least. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:44:24
Early 2010 for me. I've forgotten about it on and off ever since then. I only invested about a month ago despite having a lot of spare cash all the way through. Better late than never.

The bitstamp uk address is probably nothing more than a place that accepts post, there are some real names attached to it though.
btc-e would worry me a bit. I cannae believe people still trust vast amounts to people who stay purposely anonymous. They've stuck around so far though. 
Bitstamp is going to be easier to deposit fiat into and that is a big factor if you need to do that

But they haven't shut down the exchanges. They have decided to exert control over how the money of their citizens gets in there for easier monitoring. 
There will still be a Bitcoin market in China. It's not going to attract the same amount of investment it did before but it's still there. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:15:09
You can buy with bank transfer via localbitcoins with no trouble. It's very fast. Bittylicious as well and Bitbargain operate similarly. 
It's worth checking these places carefully on a very regular basis. At certain points over the last week they've been approaching double the rate via an exchange, at other times (far fewer though) they've matched the open market rate very closely. 
It's a lottery but they're your best chance, maybe only chance unless you're prepared to wait for transfers and verifications with exchanges. Doing that priced me out of ten bitcoins as the prices rose. 
Had I not gotten a few with the sites above and swallowed the premium I'd probably have half the coins I have now. This was all in the rising market madness though. Your circumstances may be a bit more advantageous. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:13:39
It always has.
The question is how much further it'll go up this time and crash back to. Perhaps circumstances and the volume of money will make things less explosive. 
It might go up to 2-3000 and fall back to 500. Or it might go mad and fall back to 1-2000. 
If you've sold everything now, surely it makes sense to at least buy back some as a hedge? It's only a small percentage higher depending on your exchange. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:51:28
Yup. That's all true. My mind has been blown repeatedly by how mediocre US banks are in comparison.

@_date: 2013-11-27 23:23:00
I've thought along those lines too. I also assume that at some point there will be a proper UK exchange that's realistically priced which'll extinguish any premium paid. Having said that price rises may make it look piffling. That's how I swallowed the premiums myself. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:22:15
Is there anything particularly scammy about it? It's £5.99 for a coin with a cool design. If they were asking a grand then that's a different matter. 
I have seen people trying to sell copper coins for £900 with nowhere to put a code or hologram. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:52:38
This is what I thought all along. It makes sense on the government's part and shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. 
I'm guessing a large amount of panic was along the lines of all deposits being banned. Nope. You'd just have to use a good old bank instead. 
I'm sure that'll clip the Chinese market's wings significantly. Now it'll be along the same lines as the precious metals market out there.

They're going to need to understand that what could potentially make them a vast amount of tax will go abroad if it isn't taxed in the right way.

Coinbase isn't possible unless you're established in the US. 
bittylicious, bitbargain, localbitcoins. All can be done with online banking and I've had no trouble yet. 
If you buy on a price surge all of their prices go absolutely mental. Sometimes it's a 20-30% premium. 
If you buy when things are steady or falling you'll only pay a small premium over an exchange. Right now the cheapest on localbitcoins is about the same as Mt Gox. 
Bittylicious in particular is harder to monitor because it only seems to offer one price. If you check it regularly you can sometimes get a good price. I paid £140 for a bitcoin when they were £200 + everywhere else. 
I tried Bitstamp. They had banking 'issues' so I got half the coins I could have done because I waited so long for a deposit. 
Elsewhere in Europe you have kraken and bitcoin.de among others. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:21:53
I haven't cashed out my original investment yet, but I will when it's only a small percentage of my holdings.

I think there's a way to go before the accredited investor stage. And the authorities would be more twitchy about Bitcoin as a financial instrument than just owning one directly. It would act as a big endorsement. 
Even if that did come to pass, which seems unlikely, there'll always be peer to peer options like localbitcoins. 
You could nip to another country and exchange coins for other assets or cash. 
You could sell the coins you own to these investors for vast amounts. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:29:07
I sent money to Bitstamp through Natwest. They wanted £30 for a super quick transfer. This was during Bitstamp's banking issues so it was a waste of money. 
You'd get a better rate with a proper forex company and you wouldn't have to open a new bank account. I think Bitstamp won't accept deposits from third parties though. It has to be from your registered bank account. Best to check that one.

The bigger it becomes the more sluggish price volatility will become too. 
It's still less than a minnow in global terms. 
Compare bitcoin movements to some of the altcoins. They can quadruple in an hour or go to nothing. 
Bitcoin's beyond that type of thing now but it'll be a long time, if ever, before it's truly stable. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:06:05
I've bought around 20 BTC via localbitcoins. All by bank transfer only. 
I never had to wait more than about five minutes to receive the coins and I sent them straight to a blockchain.info wallet. I've noticed sellers becoming more paranoid about ID but that's to be expected. 
I for one would happily deal with someone with that much feedback. It might be worth noting how long they've been registered for as well. 
Having never had a problem I've no idea how good localbitcoins is if something goes wrong. Worth a search I guess. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:22:38

I've gathered 46.09 over the last few weeks. I've been aware of Bitcoin since early/ mid 2010. Better late than never. 
I had no idea that the price would rise so rapidly, otherwise I could've had well over 100 for less outlay. I'm sure people will be saying the same thing next year, and for quite a while into the future. 
No idea whether I'll end up a millionaire. Any gain is a bonus. If it turns to shit I'll have enjoyed participating regardless. Throughout all the recent fluctuations I've had zero desire to sell and no feelings of panic. I might get myself hypnotised to forget about Bitcoin until the right moment. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:32:22
The UK is not an easy place to buy. 
It's worth keeping an eye on localbitcoins etc as sometimes they match the market quite closely. Other times they spiral off into infinity. It seems related to confidence levels. When things are falling they become more sensible. 
Some people have mentioned Vela Exchange based in Hong Kong which you can pay in pounds with. They also seem to accept cards. I haven't used it yet myself.

The idea of Bitcoin as a store of value, means of moving money across borders and perhaps becoming a global ledger of sorts all seems pretty darned cool to me. 
If everyone used Bitcoins for those purposes it could make the world a more stable and content place. 
The idea of it replacing all money is never going to happen. If it did then things might turn a bit dystopian.

Er, isn't that exactly what does happen when drugs/alcohol are made illegal? 
I don't think that'll help Bitcoin's value though. 
I'd say it is a small help in that the Chinese government's position is clear for now. That allows people to build things around the existing situation with a reasonable amount of certainty. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:24:02
I don't think it exists yet. 
While some of the altcoins do have some useful differences and purposes, there's nothing game changing so far. If there was we'd already know about it. 
Perhaps a new problem will come up for which an existing coin provides the answer. Perhaps Bitcoin is flexible enough to work around it. 
I guess it also depends on what Bitcoin eventually becomes. Maybe it'll always be the root and other coins will provide new answers while they all co exist.

I first read about it in 2009. At various points it's been a load easier to buy than it is now. I didn't buy in until a few months back. 
A thousand or two coins for a few dollars would have been lovely. What I have and what you have now will be lovely in a few years too. 
The ones who'll really benefit are those who forgot they had them. If you'd paid 5c for a coin it would've been mighty hard to resist selling a huge chunk when it reached a dollar. 
It's interesting to note that the top 500 richest wallets go down to holdings of 2000 coins or less. I was expecting more. I'm guessing a lot of people traded many more coins than they have now. 
The one thing that anyone who's perused these boards should hopefully have learnt is to never, ever sell everything. 
Keep a small amount in there and go hungry every now and then if you need to.
