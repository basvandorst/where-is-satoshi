It was a combination of bad passwords and bad security on iCloud (I.e, allowing many login attempts without locking the account).
It was a dictionary attack, similar to brute force, basically a program runs through every word in the dictionary until the password is located. Had there been a maximum number of login attempts, this method would have failed.
Apple is getting a lot of flack for this (And rightly so) because they are a tech company. This is security 101; a 'tech' giant *(More of a marketing company than tech, but lets not get into that discussion)* such as Apple should have this covered. This is bog standard, simple, basic stuff that they overlooked.

Such a brilliant show; the concept is great. The artwork in the manuscript is beautiful, the use of colour throughout the series is awesome and the music... The music is perfect.

Well, this vulnerability was confirmed anyway, so the point is iCloud **can** be cracked easily through brute force, so even if brute force wasn't used in the celeb leaks, the point is that; yes, they could have done, which speaks volumes about iCloud's security, don't you think?
Think about it; which is easier? Spending time digging info on celebs to answer security questions, to then change the password, to gain access, which will also alert the account owner that the password has been changed. 
**Or** run iBrute, make a cup of coffee, watch netflix for a bit, then log in as normal?

iBrute has been functioning on iCloud for a while and was only patched after the leaks. It was the easiest way of entering an account, **fact**.
