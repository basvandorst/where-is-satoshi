It’s because bitcoin is very slow to implement new tech.

Bit of an exaggeration..
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:14:53
They said not at this moment. They did the same with bcash and it’s on there now...
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:54:17
Probably not anytime soon. Alts are growing atm
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:54:57
Maybe explain your thinking?

Sorry if this is real, but it just screams fake. It could just be you dressed up to be homeless asking for donations

Faster talker to match the fast transactions, love it
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:48:19
Oh gotcha 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:45:32
Get out of my ledger Nano mom!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:42:07
In a short you want the price to go down...
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:21:53
No, bitcoin is still in the early adopter phase. It is not too late.

Calm down... it’s one of the easiest and most user friendly methods for beginners to get into and out of crypto. Not every person who uses crypto wants to see the banks crumble. They still serve a purpose and always will.

Lol who did your brainwashing. And how tight is your foil hat?
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:59:16
Dude you comment on everything coinbase related. Why don’t you make a competitor and beat them that way. They are the most important crypto exchange. Get over it
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:43:02
No bank has the business model of “let’s fuck our clients!”. While I admit they do have plenty of stupid fees, banks can only stay in business if they have clients. So why would they want to get rid of all of their clients...  their sole purpose isn’t to share our data with 3rd parties either, it’s to use depositor money to give out loans and to invest. That is where their profit comes from and that is where your interest comes from. (And your interest can be rock bottom low because it’s FDIC insured, little risk-little return)
Get out of here with your gloom and doom shit. Stop spreading lies and fear. You sound like you think bitcoin is a religion and not just a new type of currency. Pull your self out of the prepper/apocalyptic rabbit hole dude

Interesting, if only there was a way to collect fees through a node, then I think the # of full nodes would explode

You have numbers to back up the claim that predatory loans are a “huge source” of profits?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:57:07
cool thanks for the info! lol you've slightly restored my respect for the sub, it's good some people are willing to have an honest conversation with out any attacks 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:28:53
so I believe in Bitcoin, but I don't know the coding/technicals. What are the issues that come with increasing block size? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:47:23
So, other than helping the network, what are the incentives for running a full node?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:37:33
my only question then is, how many average users actually run a full node? Or is it already just large miners?
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:53:00
Exactly what I thought, get lost
