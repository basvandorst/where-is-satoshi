Strange, but all scams. I briefly tried selling BTC on ebay, I laid out a bunch of rules that others use like requiring a verified paypal and an ebay account with some history and a few other things I think. Within minutes of listing it I got a purchase, which was suspicious enough, but their paypal wasn't verified. The next person's ebay had some history but it was all suspiciously old and the purchases were all old lady clothing... again, no verified paypal. I got about a dozen orders, none of them fulfilled my requirements. I said fuck it, must be all scammers.

I know it's a different culture here on Reddit, but on 4chan we'd tell you to try Google and not waste people's time with questions you could easily answer yourself via the vast capabilities of the internet. You'll probably get a much more thorough explanation too. It's basically like he said, nobody can print more Bitcoin like the gov does dollars. It can only be mined using tons of electricity to run the software that generates bitcoins at a controlled, diminishing rate according to the consensus of all the miners running compatible software. No one person can change the software and coin distribution protocol, any changes required consensus of 51% of network. Around 2140 (I think) the last new bitcoins will be mined, and then there will only be 21 million coins, for ever.

I think it's the fact that he's stating his title as founder without naming what the hell he founded (because it either sucks or is fake).

Report him to linkedin and tell them he is a scammer trying to trick you into sending him money. They should ban him.

Best part of the original honey badger vid is where it attacks a cobra, bites it, then gets a bit by the cobra, passes out from the venom, then wakes back up with the cobra in it's mouth and continues eating it. Honey badgers are invincible, like Bitcoin.

This is a cool website!

I made a few bucks from referalls to gocelery.com (a Bitcoin broker like coinbase) a while back. Unfortunately the site got hacked and two of the people I referred have told me they lost a lot. Feelsbadman.

They just want you to know the difference between a real hardware wallet and what you've made, for your own safety. They don't mean to harsh your mellow, man. Don't get me wrong, hiding your keys in unexpected places is a neat thing to do. I used to hide my porn on an iPod shuffle to keep my parents and siblings from finding it. Just be sure to have multiple back\-ups of your keys, and encrypt them strongly.

And if the deal looks too good to be true, it is. Even if it's a market price deal you may get scammed. Even if the guy has positive feedback and lots of trades, you can get scammed. Or they'll pay you with a hacked bank account, which can get your bank account closed. If you haven't guessed yet, I got scammed once.

As long as your keys are protected with a strong password that's only in your head, and you have another backup somewhere in case your MP3 player dies, it should be sort of safe. Long as you are generating your keys safely in the first place. Like on a clean LiveCD of a free linux distro with no networking enabled.

Typically when people say hardware wallet they are referring to a device that can sign and transmit transactions without the private key leaving the device and being exposed to other possibly insecure devices like your computer. However the term "cold wallet" often refers to paper wallets that can't sign or transmit transactions without some kind of additional device. So it's probably more accurate to call it a cold wallet, I guess.

It always amazed and annoyed me as well at the Bitcoin ATM in the Southland Mall in Hayward, California. Also, many people seemed to be using the machine for their first time, judging by how long they took to use it.

The cash app has a debit card you can get from them. You can only fund it with Bitcoin you bought from them at the moment, but I asked and they said they are trying to enable bitcoin deposits soon. When I opened the app the other day it actually had a "show address" button but the app crashed when I clicked it, then it wasnt there again. 
Also they laser engrave the card with a little drawing you make in the app when you order it. Mine says "Bitcoin!".
@_date: 2018-03-10 15:56:14
It took over a week for my ID to get verified. I think maybe their growth is swamping them.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:21:58
I noticed yesterday when I went to my Bitcoin wallet in cash app, it showed a section at the bottom that said "show address". I clicked it and the app crashed. When I started it again, it showed this again for a few seconds before going back to what it used to show. 
I wonder if this means Bitcoin deposits are on the way? Then the cash card would be almost as good as a Bitcoin debit card. You could fund it instantly with Bitcoin! Currently you can only do this with Bitcoin bought within the app.

Simple bank is a good bank to use with bitcoin companies, they're Bitcoin friendly.

I also tried it a while back. Worked great!
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:25:40
He's right. Look at all the companies that people trusted to hold their Bitcoin for them. Look how many have been hacked or what not. It's getting better, but it's still safer to hold your own keys if you are competent enough.

You can add a small amount of data to a transaction. So you can break apart files into parts that fit into a bunch of transactions. Not too practical for large files but it's useful for other things. Google "bitcoin OP_RETURN" if you want to learn more.

You could use a new email address not linked to your identity. And also a pseudonym, since last time I used it, it showed me the other traders name as well. Not sure if a pseudonym is within clearxchanges terms but it doesn't cause any problems with the transfer (from what I hear). I looked up the other person from my trade on google, dude ran a computer repair shop (if that was really him).
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:35:55
I used the cash app the other day and the price was better than coinbase. Also, I'm getting a debit card from them that I can instantly fund with Bitcoin instead of waiting for funds from a sale of btc. ALSO they are laser inscribing the card with "Bitcoin!" But, it's been a week and my identity still isn't verified... So I can't withdraw my Bitcoin yet. They said it should be done soon. Maybe they're busy dealing with lots of growth.

In most of the cases like this that I've read about, the person sold to an undercover cop who plainly stated to the seller that they were intending to use the bitcoins for fraud or other crimes. If you sell anything to anybody, including a car, and they tell you beforehand "this is going to be my getaway vehicle for a robbery", then legally speaking you kind of assisted them in committing the crime, in a way. Sure sounds like entrapment to me, but bitcoin sellers need to be careful I suppose. Also, when you go through the trouble of meeting up and have the cash right in front of you, deal almost done, I'm sure it's much easier to pretend you didn't hear anything and just complete the transaction, rather than declining the transaction and reporting the criminal.

Sorry for your loss.... Never trust web wallets long term and for large amounts. They were a good wallet, shame they pulled this shit. They gave a long grace period to allow withdrawels but I figured some people would still get screwed.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:37:35
Seriously, I read about this years ago. I think someone did it to make a point about how possessing certain data shouldn't be illegal (basically saying that criminalising possession of CP is dangerous because it's a slippery slope). 
The article is very misleading. The block chain can't be used for file sharing on a large scale. You can only fit a small amount of data per transaction I'm pretty sure. And these images are not readily accessible. You basically have to decode them. BUT because it's such a polarising issue I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up in court at some point. Hopefully they'll make a reasonable decision on the issue, it seems so far nothing has happened, and this issue has been known for a while.

Holy shit, that one guy put two billion in revenue through his accounts for an illegal lending business and never hit a red flag. Funny enough, Simple bank (which I use) used to have Bancorp as their partner bank. Glad I'm not supporting their cheating ass anymore.

I bought a few thousand dollars worth of bitcoin on the way up to $700.... I wanted to hodl forever but I needed rent money one summer and due to medical problems I couldn't hold down a job. Ended up selling for a loss around $400-$500. I hated myself for it. 
But now I have a decent job and buy $50-$100 of bitcoin every week, and more during dips like this. I'm in the red right now because of purchases a few weeks ago but I've seen so many crashes it doesn't scare me anymore. I've still got about 80% of my savings in bitcoin.

I just tried the cash app recently and had the same problem. I think they don't allow deposits yet. Hopefully they do eventually. If you want a mobile wallet and trust your own mobile security practices then Mycelium is a great wallet to keep some Bitcoin on your phone. Just be sure to back up the mnemonic and don't keep too much on there, if you install one malicious app from the play store you could lose it all. For long term storage and large amounts I recommend the Trezor. For an exchange, I hear Gemini recommended quite often.

What kind of problem? Deposits never get frozen on Bisq because nobody has that power. Deposits won't get "lost" unless there is a problem with the software. If the other trader tries to scam you, that's what escrow is for.

MicroG ISN'T google though, it's an alternative. And open source. Sorry if I was unclear. I tried it a while back with Copperhead OS but ran into some problems, can't remember what.

Did you try a Google services alternative? I think there's one called microG.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:34:57
I honestly don't remember a ton about it, I suggest you do some research on it. You can't use the play store unless you get Google's play store app. The alternative to THAT is to download the APK's for the apps you want and install them (after you install microG to support them since many apps depend on Google's background services)
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:17:31
Probably because they allowed cash deposits at the ATM without a card in the first place, which is great for LBC sellers. None of the banks I've had have ever done that.
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:17:21
You can send bitcoin already. I DONT think it's instant though, if I remember correctly. I asked them about deposits because I noticed the app showed a "show address" button temporarily when I opened it. They said they are working on it. Hopefully it'll get here soon, because being able to instantly fund their cash card with Bitcoin makes it practically a "Bitcoin debit card". They offer laser etching of the card and mine says "Bitcoin!".
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:30:11
Gyft/bitpay better step their game up. They accept zero-confirmation transactions after building trust in me from past transactions, but will still randomly make me wait for a confirmation on higher value gift cards. Being able to buy gift cards with BTC instantly is pretty convenient. Just the other day I did it in-store to buy a TV that was on sale because I was a bit short on cash.

That's what it sounds like, yea. But now they're requiring the account owners card and pin.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:35:31
I noticed the price is usually a little bit better on the Cash App compared to Coinbase. I dig it. Got my card etched to say "Bitcoin!". They said they're working on enabling bitcoin deposits soon, then they'll be a viable alternative to the Coinbase shift card. I already keep some bitcoin in my cash app so if needed I can instantly sell some and use the card if an unexpected expense comes up. I think it's a great way for newbies to get into Bitcoin, they can buy it instantly, but also sell and spend it instantly if they really need to.
