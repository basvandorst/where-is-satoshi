Yeah, that's why I'm posting. It will be interesting to come back to this in a couple of months :)
@_date: 2012-09-17 23:30:01
sorry for replying so late. I sold half at $10.5, and half at $9.5 on the way to the bottom (it hit $7.5 soon thereafter). 
Then I bought back everything at around $10.5 two weeks later after the price stabilized. Lost about $1000 on this, but on the other hand - minimised the risk.

It's not that simple. The supply is not only determined by the mining ratio, but also by people who currently have bitcoins and are willing to sell them. 
Therefore, if there was no increase in demand, even when rewards halved, the price wouldn't go to $10 (it would go to less than $10, because there are other sources of supply). And on the opposite - the market for Bitcoins is growing constantly, so the demand increases. With all the OTC options of purchase that appeared recently, I was surprised that it stuck to $5 for so long.

How do you estimate the organic value?
@_date: 2012-08-19 19:53:51
Well, I'm selling, you didn't buy in the first place (as you mentioned - you still have unfulfilled orders). Same thing.
@_date: 2012-08-19 20:01:40
I think you may be right - I just reread what you said, and indeed I misunderstood some of it.
I'll reread the discussion one more time, tomorrow. Thanks :)
@_date: 2012-08-19 15:38:45
At what price did you buy?
I also prefer staying long (I planned to stay at least until the next year), but the rules are meant to be broken :)
@_date: 2012-07-19 05:34:36
Interesting approach.
So, in other words, if a stock is volatile, it means it's overpriced, and if it's stable it means that it's valued correctly?
@_date: 2012-07-19 08:19:38
I agree with you that high volatility is not good for a currency. But we're talking about "investing", or "speculating".
If I'm putting my money right now into bitcoin, I'm not interested whether it will go up, or down in a month, I only care whether 1 BTC will be equal to $20, or $2 in two years. High volatility today means nothing to me, if my calculations suggest that BTC will be worth $20 in two years. 
Similarily, if the price was extremely stable compared to fiat currencies (say 1BTC = $5 for two years straight), it would mean that BTC was a poor investment, because it's much higher risk, and you effectively lose 2%, or how how high the inflation is, every year.
Finally, a high volatility means that there is a risk that people will not adopt the currency. But I'd be more worried about say MtGox collapsing, or someone stealing my wallet, than about this.
@_date: 2012-08-19 19:55:34
Well, why? Fiat is just as safe on the exchange as BTC. Although of course not as safe as in a real bank.
This is what I'm wondering right now. Whether to keep $20K on the gox, so it's available when the price falls down, or move it back to my bank and then back to mtgox in a month or two.
@_date: 2012-07-17 17:23:21
My calculations go like this - there is a theoretical limit of 20M bitcoins, and a practical of (a guess) 10M - some bitcoins will get lost, some will be off market and so on.
Therefore, for a BTC to be worth $10, there needs to be $100M in the whole economy.
To compare this number with something... I don't know how much Pokerstars holds in it's vaults, but they were said to earn around 1-2B a year.
Therefore I'd say that if there were one or two good online casinos + SilkRoad, just that could amount to $100M of wealth put into bitcoins.
There are some more other online businesses that could thrive in the bitverse. VPN services, and virtual goods. If you want to have fundamentals, try to estimate how much money can be flowing at a given time through these businesses.
I know the estimates are quite rough, but for me (I've put in $13k into bitcoins @ 5.5), the only things that matter are whether the amount of money in bitcoins will be &gt;$100M within 2-3 years (that would give me a decent ROI), and what is the chance that it will fall to less than $20M (meaning I'd lose more than half of my money).
btw. keep in mind, that opposed to the traditional stock, the price of bitcoin is only one of the risks involved. Once you start holding money in BTC, there is a real chance that somebody will steal it from you (something that doesn't happen when dealing with the traditional stock exchange/forex), and also in case of BTC there is a chance of the system going "bankrupt" - someone manages to perform a &gt;50% attack, or miners get discouraged by the lowered rewards, and the system collapses. I'd say the chances are low, but they are there.
(throwaway account as I'm putting some numbers from my accounts here)
@_date: 2012-08-19 15:37:46
This is a throwaway account (I prefer to remain semi-anonymous when it comes to giving away numbers), but check out my history - I've been posting why I'm holding when it was $10 a month ago, or so..
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:38:07
I don't think an announcement of 2k bitcoins will cause people to panic sell. But yeah, I now the lower coins are the better off I am if I decide to buy back at the bottom.
Having said that - the way I posted is because I want to discuss the reasoning. It's a good way to learn. I tell you why I did what I did, you tell me what you do and why. We discuss and everyone learns from this.
@_date: 2012-08-19 11:11:42
but today may be the day :)
@_date: 2012-07-17 17:36:14
For btc to win in default, all the other methods of storing wealth would have to fail., it's a naive/wishful thinking.
As for people in 8-10 digit range waiting to make an entry - it would help the currency, but it doesn't make it a fundamental. Just like a prospect of Google buying your startup doesn't increase your chances of success.
@_date: 2012-08-19 20:14:12
Why artificial? 
A couple months ago someone wanted to sell, he managed to sell because I wanted to buy. Today someone wants to buy, I sell to him. I increased liquidity both times.
@_date: 2012-08-19 19:11:32
thx :)

What evidence supports your conclusion that emotion played the main role? Honest question :)
Just because the logic might've been flawed (I'm still not saying it was), it doesn't mean I used it do justify my emotions. 
@_date: 2012-08-19 19:06:18
" he has to cause a giant crash over the weekend, many peoples hands are tied since most services are closed."
What do you mean by this? What kinds of services are closed for the weekend?
@_date: 2012-09-17 23:33:28
Blockchain.info - definitely.
Then Satoshidice, because I've put 800BTC into their IPO :)
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:46:02
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:30:13
As for the second part of your reply - why do you assume you know my thought process? How do you know I made an emotional decision? Because it looks like it to you?
It's funny that you think you're more competent to know what's in my mind than I do. I'd understand if you *doubted* that I made a non-emotional choice. But you don't *doubt*. You *know* it! How, how, how?
Or do you just believe that humans are inherently incapable of using logic in the times of stress?
As for the outcomes being 50/50, it's a nice discussion, so let's discuss.
Sure, there is no way the outcomes are 50/50. But even if they're 70/30, the rest of the math holds. If they're 80/20 it almost holds. So, the question is - do I/you/whoever believes it will cross $12 with more than 80%? Or, to not use numbers - do you believe that it's very-very likely to jump back to $12 any time soon? I don't.
As for why I believe nobody with big bucks will buy in any time soon... It doesn't make sense to make big purchases now. The difference between bids and asks is too high. He'd make a big purchase knowing that prices of selling are 20-30% lower than that. In other words - it would move the market too much.
If I had big money (like $200k-1M), I'd wait for more asks to appear before buying in. I think this is the only rational choice for a big player, and the only question remains what will the small players do.
Other question. Did you ever see a market getting rebound right after a crash? I mean - getting down 50% one weekend because of a plenty of people selling (not just one person), and getting back to the original levels next week?
@_date: 2012-08-19 15:40:26
Good question. This was my original plan.
Right now I'm leaving my cash on mtgox and I think I may put it back to get back to btc after the dust settles and before rewards get halved. Like August... 
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:33:47
There's nothing wrong. The question is whether you think we've hit the bottom, or you think we'll fall far further. If you think it's the latter it's better to get out, and jump back in on the bottom (at a risk of losing 10% of potential profits if it's the bottom now, and it will stop falling).
@_date: 2012-07-19 05:32:51
well, if they're getting into bitcoin, and not leaving, the price will remain, right?:)
as for the fundamentals not changing - Bitcoinica failed on May, and one of the theories is that it was keeping the price of bitcoin arfiicially down - and now it's getting to the position it should've been all along.
finally - how do you calculate that required price of $10 by the end of the year?
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:32:11
how do you know it's just one or a few big players? I mean - it's obviously a few big players, but how do you know they make for most of the fall, not for like 10% of it?
(honest question)
