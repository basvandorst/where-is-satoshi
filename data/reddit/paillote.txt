Use SBanken or one of many other banks that does international transfers without fee. I have never ever seen such a fee anywhere. Surprised to see it even exists.

So you think a fixed supply and deflation is the solution? 
@_date: 2018-09-25 14:43:07
Right, but definitely very harmful nevertheless.

The ones benefiting from inflation is the ones who need to borrow for house, cars, education etc, i.e. the average guy. The ones that benefit from deflation is the ones with lots of money. Why the massive concern for the millionaires in this forum? Is everyone filthy rich here?

You think anyone is receiving that money as a handout? The last 70 years millions have been brought out of poverty.  Do you think that would happened if all we could do was slice an existing cake into ever smaller pieces? We need an expanding cake for that.

20 billion bolivars equals 96 usd. And that's a record. Trading in Venezuela surely will both save the country and prop up the price of bitcoin.

Because it is the best known way of solving big economic challenges. You know, they dont have to keep doing it, but the alternative is worse. If stop printing was the solution, of course they would have.

Get your facts straight. Nerds didn't create the internet. It was created by the American army who needed a network that would continue working even if multiple nodes/lines where destroyed by the enemy. Hence they made Arpanet, what has later morphed into the internet we know today.

So true. In Scandinavia cash is hardly used anymore. Buy a chewinggum you pay with cash. Worst losers are the beggars, no one have spare coins anymore. Even ATMs are phased out as cash is so rarely used. Card use is 100% free, so why not. Beat that Bitcoin ;)

Silly. Norway exports lots of clean hydropower to continental Europe, f.ex. Germany and Poland. But because miners take out a big chunk of that capacity,  there are less to be exported. So the continent must resort to other polluting sources like coal. Keep boasting about Bitcoin and its use of clean energy, but fact is it indirectly causes lots of pollution. 
Electricity can be sent great distances too, unlike what is claimed here. But again, the incentive to build power lines are gone when you can sell it to a local miner.

Point taken. Will try to phrase myself in more neutral tone. Regardless. No power generation is without harmful effects to the environment. Bitcoin may not care, but powers around the world surely is starting to do so.

Looks like you are not aware that bitcoiners can only make money on another guy's loss. Like a game of poker, no money is made at the table. The ones that foam are the losers, not the ones that didn't participate.

If you want to buy 3500 usd the spread is much bigger.  You omit to mention that the sell order at that spread is just a few dollars worth, but sure for smaller orders you are right.

Patient is not some as good. Good investors get returns a lot quicker than that.

Some times? If that was true you would do it every single day...

And what countries is that? That's less than in  developed countries. Thailand was mentioned,  but the spread there is massive.

Exactly, in reality you don't have the profit you mentioned.  If you had, everyone would be doing it.

Godness. Why dont you refute what the guy is saying, insted of this crazy analogy about internet and cryptos. Internet and cryptos are not the same. I repeat: Not the same. And no, I don't remember when "everybody" said that they didn't want email or internet. Because they didn't. Where you even born in the mid-nineties? What happened was that it became a total craze and everyone and his mother would struggle to get internet and make their own web-page, even if the page only consisted of your name and an "under construction" gif. Sure, those guys you describe existed, but they were a novelty and even to this day we make fun of them. They were the backwards people reluctant to change. The difference with sceptics to cryptos is that most of them are tech savy, highly informed people. Now, what was factually wrong with what Megadoom wrote?
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:18:51
You are right. The rules has been relaxed. My bad.

 In Scandinavia it is illegal to not accept cash.

A little inflation keeps people spending instead of saving waiting for things to get cheaper. The latter happens  with deflation. When people spend less , the economy slows down as demand for goods and services get  low. Inflation is also good for people with loans (the majority) as the value of the loan gets worth less and hence easier to pay back. Only the rich with much savings benefits from deflation.

Yes you can. Don't know about US, but in many European and Asian countries you can. I use an app where you identify yourself with your phone number. Then you can transfer money to anybody in your phone's contact list that also uses this app. Very useful for transferring money to family and friends.
Forgot to add, its free. Think it is getting harder and harder for Bitcoin to compete. It had some benefits years ago, not so anymore.

The first one is valid, second is no different than regular internet banking.

Nice theory, but for them to exit through selling btc, they would first need to buy btc, so nope, it's not this that drives the price down.

Daily limits are there in case someone gets access to your account. You can raise it upon request. How often do you exceed daily limit anyway? Never filled out a single form, what are you talking about? Finally, Bitcoin is not widely accepted anywhere. It's such a stupid argument.  It would be like someone arguing that there would be no exchange fees if USD were widely accepted (which it actually is in many coutries).

Only my bank can see my transaction with a cc. The whole world can see my transactions with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:20:31
Bullshit. Transfering money to another country is almost useless with bitcoin The spread between buy and sell is huge, the wait for clearing your money is very long and how are you going to be able to open both a bank account and an exchange in a foreign country? Don't argue that you can pay directly with bitcoin. Buying coffee at obscure coffee shops is not going to cut it. Finally, have you been hiding under a rock the last years? Doing wire transfers or ATM withdrawals are not time consuming, not expensive if you choose a bank without fees.
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:00:15
Inflation is good. Every single central bank works hard to have controlled inflation. On the other hand, deflation is one of  the worst possible thing that can happen to the economy. Guess this is to much to grasp for the average adolescent bitcoiner.

Funny how Warren Buffet has gone from an useless old fool to being quoted all the time in crypto circles. 
How it works in crypto space:
   Retarded: Someone who says something I disagree with
   Genius: Someone who says something I agree with

Who on earth except crypto nerds would know or even care about hash power? It's not even a feature. What is getting better and better? Lightning surely has to as it is not useable at the moment.

How often do we have to see this never-happened scenario repeated? I need Bitcoin because I can transfer 100m USD without fees. Talk about grasping at straws to give Bitcoin validity.
It's not even true. Buy 100m BTC on an exchange and try to sell it later. You will drive up price like crazy when buying and crashing it when selling, dwarfing the 30K loss you mentioned. Heck, even buying 100$ worth and selling it a second later on the same exchange causes substantial losses due to the margins.
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:03:54
I got in without a clue, but sold when I got a grasp of the tech. There is nothing revolutionary about any aspect of bitcoin, and what small benefits it has is dwarfed by the drawbacks. Believers conveniently choose to ignore that and instead likes to compare with fringe cases and imaginary tales of problems that might come in a made up future. 
The day, the market runs out of greater fools you can unload your coins too is coming closer and closer.
