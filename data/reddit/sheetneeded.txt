I don't think you understand remotely how large scale ecommerce works

Wow no shit. I'm just pointing out that wealth distribution is irrelevant in making a case for or against in this situation.

are you delusional and can you please (along with the rest of r/bitcoin) please stop posting this blindly optimistic drivel?  usually i am not a fan of circlejerking but this subreddit has become full of complete morons

Are you trolling or just stupid? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:48:49
Shut up and go back under the bridge

Lol dude.... You sound pretty angry. I think I'd be angry if I was as dumb as you too though tbh. But keep looking back at your own words through the lense of revisionist history
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:17:05
You're just wrong. I see where you're coming from but you're just incorrect

This isn't even the world's second bitcoin atm.

You do realize China is mostly poor too right?

Lol nice source. Is your last name McGrath Goodman by any chance?

I don't think you understand what 'day to day operations' even means... The integration of bitcoin is not a d2d operation. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:10:12
You're a moron. Go Fuck off with your 3 bitcoin already

Because hope &gt; reductive logic &gt; deductive logic. 
This sub seems to be getting worse and worse, I feel like a mladyesque mommas basement type of guy everytime I come here.

He just sounds generally ungrateful. I understand you love his work but that doesn't mean he's not a shitty person

Comparing bitcoin to a worthless piece of paper is actually a terrible analogy. Bitcoin has intrinsic value as does gold, just because it isn't something tangible you can hold is pretty much the reason why you don't understand this comparison

lol.  using a dictionary to try and understand currency? op is 100% right, 'currency' as related to the article is definitely as he describes and china is just saying essentially that btc is too volitile to treat as a regular currency.
