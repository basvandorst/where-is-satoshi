Bitcoin and in general crypto currency at the moment is a hype. If you want to get out of this total profit, you need to treat this without emotion. From the beginning, you must have a certain tactic, and you must stick to it. And you must understand that the money invested in bitcoin can go away all, you can not know exactly what will happen tomorrow. I'm just trying to show it from the other side. Peace!
And I hope that bitcoin will grow up tomorrow, but in this case there should be no emotions.

It's a question.
Thank you for the article!

It would be cool, but it doesn't look believable. If earlier bitcoin grew out of hype, now the excitement is gradually passing, and if there is not some kind of affection of the position (any), it will gradually fall, and people will lose they money. Just my opinion.

I think it's just for your safety. Your account can be hacked and hackers can try to do something from it, and if the exchange doesn't ask for your data and doesn't make sure that you is you, then they can accidentally help hackers. I think everything is thought out here.
