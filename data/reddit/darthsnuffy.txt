@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:19
Theres a lot of questions dog, u have any? not really an AMA without your question
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:09
it was a rough choice
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:45
Im gunna buy back in lower bro
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:56:32
That is a terrible reference to a sexual pun? The "word-play" man...... like idk that just doesn't really make sense. Like i get it, because im forcing to make the association between what you said and anal sex , given the context of me knowing that anal was referenced before your last comment. otherwise I would be very unimpressed and confused in a casual conversation. It just didnt flow naturally like youd want it to, very forced. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:07:52
JP Morgan lol, heard they arent a fraud
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:02:30

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:49:14
You think so? Thanks bro. Im very secure in who I am, Im probably an alpha. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:37
Yeah Im a whale. kinda have to be when youve invested the house and the kids college funds
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:04
10k probs. What about you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:30
Same to be honest. Since it went to 20k, I figured parabolic until 100k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:32
Ok that one was actually pretty good. Not forced and I totally got what u meant. Come out with that one straight out of the gate next time and youll kill it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:15:53
haha good idea
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:15:34

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:28
how low you think itll go? You in?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:23
When I see what desire does to people, what it’s done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:02:16
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:29

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:09
Yo max, Is that a question or a statement broooo?  Cause this is an AMA i only reply to questions. Plus the guys above think im an alpha not an idiot!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:39

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:18:06
If i had to choose I would go for proof of stake. Way better then proof of work. idk there are a lot of good modifications of the two now. hard to know what will succeed. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:51
I wish.... but Ill get better. 3rd times the charm i hear
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:51:05
Sorta yeah. itll turn into FOMO when it rebounds tho. What about you? Think itll go lower?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:08
Nice man, yeah I would have done the same thing probably in your situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:04
u sold?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:07:07
I think itll probably work out for you. Seems to have bottomed atm
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:49:32
happy to still be holding some of my life savings before the end.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:40
Yeah when it goes lower. Dont want to catch a falling knife but who knows. Rather ride the momentum back up
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:03
is that a reference to my poor football skills? My dad said the same thing, really got to me
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:55

When bitcoin hit one dollar ����
@_date: 2014-01-12 02:35:10
Amazing article
@_date: 2014-01-26 05:14:45
He should wait until bitcoin becomes a mainstream medium of exchange and/or store of value. Too soon to dilute the market, a crash now could create reluctance to accept the currency and slow down its adoption. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:42:30
I thought we killed the bear whale? I have a plaque on my wall to commemorate the brave men who manned the buy wall.
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:30:31
I'm a bitcoin bull, but we said the same thing at 1000, 800, 500, 350, and now. If you want to rationalize holding on to it and clinging to hope that's fine, but statements like this are just stupid. Just because something goes down doesn't mean it'll go up any sooner.
