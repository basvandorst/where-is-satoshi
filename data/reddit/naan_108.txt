Very obviously the maker of the physical coins would have access to your private keys

@_date: 2018-03-09 03:52:04
Wow amazing man I’m impressed at your generosity 
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:29:43
So he got caught with weed a few times and he’s ‘been in trouble on and off with authorities’ ... smh how about the ‘authorities’ have been harassing him and not affording him basic human rights?

...so don’t buy it ... then u can come back in 20 years and be pissed u missed the opportunity to be one of the wealthiest people in the world 
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:08:34
And what exchange will u be using to “go short”?
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:45:35
Privacy also affects free market for business ... if ur competition can see how much ur sales are going for and WHERE they are going to it disrupts the economy ... we need 100% anonymity to support the free market

Ur argument is that crypto is volatile so not stable or good as fiat, USD is guaranteed to lose 2-4% per year due to inflation, btc has gone up every year since 2010 ... ur looking at short term price swings and not the bigger picture, with entire nations states companies etc on board it won’t fail 
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:56:50
Done! Send me ur address but I have a new special wallet that requires I enter the private key of anyone I’m sending to so you’ll also need to provide that 
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:28:34
 
Basically he had weed on him and was charged with a felony weed possession (Arizona strict law) then later was selling bitcoins on localbitcoins and was searched and found some Ammo in his house ... aka innocent man kidnapped by a tyrannical govt hell bent on destroying basic human rights and the constitution 
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:59:13
He hasn’t even responded with a thank u I hope he got the message to check his wallet ����

Ive never and would never own Bch.. but I remember all the poor saps complaining about it “I just got Bch on coinbase and it cost me $40 to send and took 2 hours wtf! I thought this was supposed to be cheap and fast!” Lol

The 0-conf scam is unrealistic... how many bad actors would double spend?

They can install chips inside the hardware that even if you reset ur seed they can still gain access.. that’s why we always say ... ALWAYS BUY FROM THE MANUFACTURER WEBSITE

@_date: 2018-04-15 12:57:03
What if they don’t? In 20 years bitcoin will be a global currency more powerful than the USD, they will be forced to and their citizens will resent them for keeping them from emerging with wealth 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:46:39
If u don’t buy now in 10 years u may wish u had a time machine again lol

Untrue they can install chips to always have access

Ledger does not sell on amazon and explicitly state not to buy from third party websites to my knowledge 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:13:58
Also social security is not “govt spending” because it’s a separate tax designed to be a forced retirement plan that u pay into

No it’s saying “of the 250k expected to report only 100 did”

Free? We are forced by threats of violence to pay for a government who spend most of our money overseas.. in global studies America ranked  in personal freedom ... they track everything we do and have failing infrastructure, schools, etc.

60% of the budget is spent overseas .. “military” is largely an overseas globalist agenda that has zero to do with public safety or the benefit of the average citizen 
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:53:59
I guess we are just using “FUD” for everything now? U do realize ledger isn’t a cryptocurrency? And it is true that it is safest to always buy from the manufacturer ... and by the way- ledger website is ledgerwallet.com .. NOT the website you posted “ledger.fr”
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:58:49
I know how it works but social security is a separate tax and it’s not intended to be an extra income stream for the govt although that is how it’s used, Medicare is also a separate tax ... from direct federal income tax very little is spent on the American people 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:54:39
Since I personally know several people who did I think they are BSing to increase regulation
