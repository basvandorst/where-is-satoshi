Are these the same Koreans whose government is putting controls on their exchanges?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:13:44
Well, maybe $0.10 - kinda like play money.
If there are no buyers, liquidity falls to almost zero, which the price needs to reflect.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:06:42


Pretty much exactly what I've been saying.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:55:06
Yes, but at least they are backed by the full faith and credit of their sovereign governments...at least in western countries.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:29:56
You mean like being able to distinguish between the block chain and Bitcoin?  Can you do that, bucko?
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:59:23
Sure, but I wouldn't call it reliable savings when governments all over the world are starting to change the rules regarding exchanges, taxation etc.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:20:41
Yes, I wish I had put 1,000 BTC back when it was worth pennies, just to be at the table, but then I read stories about how people have trouble getting their cash back out.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:01:13
Do you think governments will be willing to give up the ability to just print money?
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:19:56
No, I mean people who have lived through the fiscal crisis, the dotcom meltdown, the '87 crash etc.  Anyone who came out of school in the past 10 years has only ever known a rising stock market.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:53:42
Okay, maybe there's a use for some form of distributed currency, but BTC isn't going to be it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:57:49
Secure?  Didn't it just drop 50% in value in recent weeks?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:08:33
Sure, but hardware/software wallets and exchanges have only recently become somewhat solid (sic), so I'm just wondering *where* someone would have kept their keys safe over the years, avoiding events like exchange shutdowns.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:25:27
The government will always pay it's suppliers, employees and pensioners in the national currency.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:11:05
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:25:32
Get their hands on it...for what?  Not needed for anything.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:57:53
You keep on buying then.  We can touch base when it's $0.05 again.
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:08:19
I  think it will continue to police itself but, that said, a leap of faith will always be required when exchanging any national currency for this form of digital money/store of value.  There will probably always be people around with this motivation, however.
I personally don't place much trust in it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:39:06
Why, because you don't like having the wool pulled from your eyes?
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:38:23
Suck it up, buttercup.  Maybe try silence someone else.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:15:10
It means if you hold it, then if X BTC can buy a certain amount of commodities like an ounce of gold or barrel of oil today, then it should have the same buying power over time.
That said, if you paid $5,000 for a royal blue beanie peanut elephant in 1995, that was not a store of value.  Just saw them on eBay for $8.
I almost put BTC in the same category.  It will only remain a store of value as long as there is perceived demand for it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:00:08
More fun watching price drop today...from the sidelines 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:11:03
Stocks are regulated and give you ownership in bricks and mortar businesses.  That said,there are also derivative products which are also more like gambling.
At the current time, digital currencies like BTC are basically more like the latter.  Blockchain is merely the public record of all transactions.  
BTC itself can't revolutionize business.  Much more regulation will be needed.  In the mean time, it's mostly just a form of gambling.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:02:21
The price of *Peanut* the royal blue Beanie Baby elephant also went up...to $5,000 on eBay, back in the 90s.
You can buy one for $8 today on eBay.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:12:59
So, these *whales* really have no liquidity unless they can find a lot of new buyers.  They are trapped.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:49:44
Sure, there are risks associated with any *asset*, but at least real estate, precious metals and stocks are *assets*.
The concept of BTC is useful, but it needs to have some sort of backing if it ever wants to replace money as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:18:50
Recently, I mused over how my finances would look if I had bought 1,000 BTC years ago for cheap.  On paper, I'd be worth $12M.  How easy would it be for me to be able to cash that out today, though, due to daily limits on exchanges and the need to find buyers?
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:13:04
What good is it if you can't liquidate your position?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:31:49
Why?  Nobody needs BTC...at least not in stable democratic countries.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:01:18
User acceptance.  Catchier name.  It just met the need better and caught on.
We're not even up to the level of MySpace in terms of cryptocurrencies user acceptance yet.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:12:18
It's not investing.  It's gambling/speculating.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:37:30
I actually went as far as opening accounts on a couple of exchanges, but at the end of the day there just hasn't been any incentive for me to buy in.  If anything, I've come to the realization that whether I bought $100 or $1,000 worth, I don't really *own* anything.  It merely gives me a place at the gambling table.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:02:38
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:46:24
You have to remember that governments can change the laws. In the 30s Roosevelt made it illegal to own gold... right before he revealed it from $20/oz to $35.  There are some governments looking to shut down BTC exchanges. This is not an environment you can trust with your life savings
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:17:38
No one can accurately predict when.
This guy is in good company (Warren Buffet).
The reality is, if you own BTC, you don't really own anything.  There is no underlying tangible asset.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:03:31
Exactly right.  I should add that *it* is really *nothing* other than a number.  You can't eat it, sleep in it, wear it etc.  The only thing you can do is try to find a buyer for it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:38:14
Don't hate it.  It's an interesting technology, but the more I study it the more I come to the conclusion that it's basically just a form of gambling.
You could be a BTC millionaire, but you have to keep your fingers crossed that there will always be buyers for your *asset*, which is dubious at best.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:52:20


No, they are not.
A BTC is only worth what the next buyer is willing to pay for it.  Unlike real estate, there is no guarantee that there will always be buyers for BTC.  It's purely an incarnation.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:13:47
In this economic climate?  No way you can say *definitely*.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:26:03
The government will always pay it's suppliers, employees and pensioners in the national currency.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:17:03
The moon?  Hardly.  The average Joe doesn't need BTC.  It's just one spook away from crashing in value.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:41:53
Most of society ignores BTC.  It's not a racket.  It's digital money.  Note that I didn't say currency.  It's not very practical as a currency in its current implementation.
Most currencies today are already digital, but not all forms of money (a store of value) are.
I think it will continue as a form of quasi money/black market currency, but it won't be allowed to supplant existing national currencies.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:00:29
The software in my phone and computer does something useful.  A bitcoin does nothing.  
You could say the same thing (does nothing) about fiat currency, but at least the latter is totally fungible.  The same cannot be said for BTC.  Not much different than poker chips that can only be spent in a particular casino.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:30:55
As far as the *pay to play* aspect is concerned, yes, but most people expect to exchange their time (work) with income that is tangible, not just bits on a blockchain.
Just look at India as an example, where the poor immediately try to convert cash income into gold...even fractions of a gram.  They don't gamble with that money.  They save it.
OTOH, in western countries we have people *paying to play* with BTC on their cell phones, trying to parlay their BTC purchases into cash profits.
I just think the gambling reference suits the whole BTC thing very well indeed.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:52:11
At the end of the day, it's really nothing more than a form of gambling, requiring participants to *pay to play*.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:12:42
Most currencies today are digital.  Bitcoin isn’t really a currency, rather, it is a digital form of money/store of value.  I think that’s the real difference.  For that reason, I think it will always be quasi money or a black market currency.
I think governments will be successful in ensuring that BTC doesn’t become used as a national digital currency.  That is easy to do with legislation.  This would relegate it the uses I mentioned above.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:46:25
I suggest you download the Bitcoin Ticker app and have a look at the 1-month chart.  Corrections happen in an uptrend, but the chart clearly shows a downward trend for about 4 weeks now.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:04:28
It's value will flatten at best, going forward.  
I am sure quite a few people have been scared away following the recent 30% price drop.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:10:28
Not since currencies became fiat.  When I was a kid, a $1 bill was a fortune.  I could exchange it for 20 chocolate bars or Bazooka gum.  $1 also bought 5 loaves of bread and, I think, 3 packs of cigarettes.
That all changed when Nixon closed the gold window.
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:00:10


Not tainted?  Lost coins.  Stolen coins.  Bitcoin *whales*.  Does this sound like the genesis of a stable cryptocurrency?
The concept is good, but the current implementation is not.  It cannot succeed without regulation.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:29:35
Really instills confidence in the cryptos, doesn't it?
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:38:08
The fact is, you don't own anything tangible.  Just a unique number.  Who in their right mind pays $20K for a unique number?
Sure, money today is fiat currency, but at least it accepted everywhere and recognized as the national currency.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:24:10
What value?  It's virtual, existing as no more than a number on a ledger.  When [Venezuala](  wants to enter the cryptocurrency game, you know there are problems.
The math is complex and there are only supposed to ever be 21M BTC (18M today), but there are 3000+ other cryptocurrencies.  All virtual.  I don't care how many GPUs have to crank away for months to create the next coin.
It's juts not ready for prime time.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:54:15
I've seen the value of the dollar become eroded for decades.  A dollar used to by 5 loaves of bread...at the corner store to boot.  The same has happened to just about every currency in existence.  As much as BTC supporters might want it to change things, this particular cryptocurrency won't.
You can have a centralized ledger without BTC.  I have more faith in the viability of blockchain technology than I do in BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:03:21
I might get in at $300.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:49:00
Pretty much.  Buyers have to perceive them as having value, because in reality you don't own anything tangible.  Not altogether different from fiat currencies today, but at least there is government regulation for currencies.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:34:10
Invest in things you believe have value and that others will want to invest in also.
Not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:18:20
I won't be priced out.  I have no reason to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:49:10
Not just that, aren't something like 50% of all BTC held by 100 individuals? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:37:27
When you think about it, what value? OK, mining them takes effort, but if your had $1M in them right now, it's not like you have gold bullion. It's basically a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:19:15
Is there a way to know where the coins are (exchange, wallet)?  There are news stories re: small number of owners holding the majority of BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:20:08
If you Google *bitcoin whale*, something like 40% of BTC may be held by 1,000 individuals. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:47:19
Question: How did people store their bitcoins back in 2009?
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:48:24
It's recorded on the blockchain.  See [story](
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:19:15
Looks like they dropped a few along the way...about 100M.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:41:58
Needs government backing to succeed.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:16:55
You mean the way Nortel investors *played it long*?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:58:25
It's value has been eroding for 50 years.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:23:28


It was also part of the Bretton Woods Agreement.
I think part of what fuelled Bitcoin's rise was the ability of people to trade it on their mobile phone apps. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:49:00
The price of *air* continues to fall.  Anyone surprised?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:06:51
Because the name of this thread isn't BitcoinFans.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:27:43
Folk who don't want to wait for it to hit $3,000.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:56:35
Yes, but not for the reasons you think.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:44:51
You speculated...and it didn't work out.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:39:26
It **is** backed by nothing.  So are dollars, BTW.
For something to have value, though, others have to covet it, but people don't covet bitcoins the way they do a national currency, art work, precious metals and gems...or even the latest iPhone.
Until bitcoins become real money, people simply aren't going to covet them they way they do all other things that they perceive as valuable.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:56:56
That trigger point was crossed.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:55:58
Seen the latest charts?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:16:17
It's crypto vs western governments.  The latter makes the rules and therefore will win in the end.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:54:22
Gold has been a store of value for over 5,000 years.  Bitcoin has been a flash in the pan by comparison.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:17:54
Because there can be spinoff effects from the price of BTC crashing.  On paper, the market value of BTC accounts has fallen something like $400B (!) in the past couple of months.  Hopefully, a lot of investors didn't buy in at $20K.  Those that did, will retrench from other types of economic activity, like the stock market and purchasing goods/services.  Imagine if you mortgaged your home to buy BTC in December.
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:38:33
If the world economy plunged into darkness tomorrow, what good are bitcoins going to do you...unlike something physical like gold or diamonds?
A wafer of gold will get you food and transportation.  A bitcoin will get you...?
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:58:17
It's not backed by anything.  The value could fall to zero.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:47:46
Good question. There are two aspects to BTC: a form of money and the transfer system. I look at both from the point of view of acceptance and risk. In the case of the latter (xfer system), block chain seems fairly well accepted and low-risk. As a form of money, there is a certain level of acceptance, but it’s rather like selecting a currency club to join, almost none of which are considered official by national governments. I think this makes cryptocurrencies high risk.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:04:47
Something will, but not BTC, which is nothing more than a finite list of hard-to-compute numbers, most of which are already held (or lost).  The current holders will sell you theirs for a price so you can join the club.
It's the right concept, just not the right asset.
