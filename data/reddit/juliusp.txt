Is there a law against leaving the United States without a passport?

Imagine government as the entity owning all the land in your country. By not playing by the rules you are trespassing.
A government has the geographical right to create rules on their property just like you have on yours.

What? Of course organisations can own things, that's just silly. How do you think companies work?
If it in any way makes it clearer, define the ownership of the government as all the citizens of that country. 
@_date: 2012-12-04 08:05:18
Well in a way yes.
But in the same way as it's not accepted by the members of the international community to invade another country, your invasion of my house won't be accepted by the members of our community. You would be arrested and the ownership would be transferred back to me by the government, because they have the power to control the area.
In a scenario without the government, I would have had to take the house back myself.

You do have ownership rights but they can be limited in the area collectively owned by you and your peers.
Imagine you, me and a third person own a house together. You want to have a gun in our house, me and the third person do not. You have the right to own a gun, but you can't bring it inside because the majority of the shareholders in the house forbid you. This is perfectly legal and within our ownership rights.
Government is just another layer above this, you me and 300 million other own this land together, if the majority of the shareholders want to enact a rule inside their collective property it's in their right to do so.
The difference between the country and the house is that to join the house, you have to make an investment and you can sell this investment when you want to leave. For the country it "free" to join (except the member fee, taxes) but you also don't get anything back when you leave.
Now in the US, we have a couple of rules that our forefathers agreed upon that are supposed to limit the tyranny of the majority. However, they also acknowledged the fact that these rules aren't set in stone and wrote rules so that we can amend and retract from the constitution as society develops.

Well in the end, the only thing that defines ownership is the one that has the force to control it. Government is a way to control a geographical area collectively so that it's citizens can focus on other things.
@_date: 2012-12-03 08:02:16
And you can leave the country without one, no problem. It's getting in that's the problem.

There are plenty of ways to tax with bitcoin.
Tax isn't something that's automatically withdrawn from your account. It's calculated and payed by the companies that sell stuff or employ people. This would still be the way in a bitcoin world.
However, you do have a point in that it would be easier to hide your money.
The thing is, if you don't keep your accounting, the IRS will do the accounting for you (often based on general assumptions, like the number of employees, inventory etc. and in no way to your favor). You either pay what they want or go to jail. No reason why it would work differently with bitcoins.
(This is in no way an endorsement for either system, it's just my contribution to the discussion)

Easy just use SI-prefixes.
1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC
1 µBTC  = 0.000001 BTC
1 nBTC = 0.000000001 BTC
The smallest unit is currently 10 nBTC or 0.00000211 USD

keep it

I would write the whole thing out. It's supposed to be a legal document after all, kinda defeats the point if it ambiguous. 
Stamps for bitcoin-addresses would be a cool thing actually, or check like invocies.

If they bought their coins for $5 they have more than enough reason to be happy.

The third party file managers still use system calls implemented by the device drivers to access the file system. Modern encryption is completely invisible to the user space applications.

You wouldn't be allowed to stay there for the rest of your life. That's for sure.

You do know that you can move your bitcoins from MtGox to other exchanges right? Only the market is down not their website.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:55:42
It IS a small market. MtGoxUSD has a volume of $10 million per day. Compare this to the NYSE at $153 BILLION, or the foreign exchange at $3.21 TRILLION a day. 
Bitcoin is nothing in the financial world *yet*.

like mm = millimeter, mBTC = millibitcoin. Or just use the prefix "milli", like we do for weight, the unit is often pretty obvious.

The address would be a field to be filled at the signing. It's still a valid contract even if it's written by hand.
