Think back to what you were doing at that time, surely you exposed the wallet sometime just before the transaction. If the coins were stationary since 2014, then the attacker must have only just gained access.

The inflation bug would have caused a chain split since not all nodes were vulnerable, and older nodes from before the bug was introduced would have recognised the invalid transactions/block. It's nice to be able to check the sum of current outputs, but this bug would have been obvious if abused.

This book was my first purchase on Silk Road. Wanted to test the system first and it turned out to be a great read.
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:16:25
Surely it wouldn't be quite as easy, given that you would have to broadcast to other nodes that hadn't received your original transaction in the minutes between paying and leaving the shop. 
I'm no expert, and I appreciate you correcting me. 
It would be nice if we could come up with some function to help secure 0 conf transactions for merchants though.
@_date: 2015-12-24 01:07:11
Speculators have to buy bitcoin in order to speculate, thereby reducing available supply relative to demand, increasing price. Increased price means increased market cap, and that provides utility to bitcoin as a network. It is more functional when it can move more value around. 
Definitely not cancer.
@_date: 2015-12-20 00:40:03
This way new users can actually use core as a wallet without a lengthy download and period of confusion/worry. 
Obviously this wouldn't have worked in the early days because we needed to get many copies of the existing chain out there, but surely we are past that bootstrapping phase now.

I feel like that's the cause of the issues (some) people have with RBF though. If it was just to increase the fee while keeping the same receiving address it would remove the possibility of fraudulent use cases.
Please correct me if I misunderstand but with full RBF I could pay a merchant in person, receive goods and leave the shop, then use RBF to send those coins to an address I control instead of the merchant. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 11:31:39
It seems to me that all the issues with RBF stem from being able to change the receiving address. If it was just to allow a fee increase then 0 conf transactions would be just as safe to accept as they are now, which is to say mostly safe for small amounts.

As an example it's worth checking the size of the Etherium blockchain. It has grown from ~200GB to ~450GB since January. At this rate it may become infeasable for a home user to sync the chain from scratch, so limiting blockchain growth helps preserve decentralisation, but it also makes the limited data space more expensive.

If last year's bubble cycle plays out similarly to the previous ones, we should expect the market to slowly bleed down for around a year or so, to a low of 15-25% of the high ($3-5k) before getting fairly boring and flat for another year maybe. Once the next halvening gets closer the promise of diminishing supply and lower inflation might start an uptrend leading into the next bubble cycle. 
Obviously I don't have a clue what the future holds, but the above is what I expect.

But the 2FA code is only valid for 30 seconds or so right? and localbitcoins own logs show that there was 10 minutes between the time I typed in a code to log in, and the code that was used to withdraw.
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:57:19
I didn't realise that's how 2FA worked, thanks for the tip. 
I always assume this pc is compromised since it is used by my family frequently to download tv shows and games etc, and so I never store bitcoin on it for any length of time.
I do have a canary electrum wallet on here with $5 worth of bitcoin in it and no password. It's still there though :P
So if the 2FA code is generated by localbitcoins and sent to my phone, how does my pc being compromised mean the attacker was able to use my 2FA?

@_date: 2015-05-12 21:48:40
yeah, using MalwareBytes. Nothing "High Risk" popped up, just some tracker stuff, although I assume that just means that this attack isnt in their database yet?

The last few digits of a bitcoin address are a checksum, meaning it is almost impossible to make that mistake. If you are typing the address manually and make one mistake, the address will almost certainly not be valid, and the transaction will fail.

Banks use the fractional reserve system to effectively create more money. An example;
Account A is opened with a balance of $100 deposited to the bank, bank has reserve requirements of 10%, meaning they can lend out $90 of that original deposit, which they do. That $90 is then deposited into account B and 90% of that can then be loaned out, ie a further $81. That $81 is then deposited into account C. This process can continue, turning the original $100 deposit into an effective balance of almost $900.
This is what people mean when they say that banks use fractional reserves to create money.

You seem to be confused about market caps. The market cap is not "real money" and is not a pool of USD. It is simply the total number of bitcoin in existence, multiplied by the last price it is exchanged for.
If I create a currency with 1 billion coins, then you buy one from me for £1, the market cap of our coin is £1billion until the next sale. We did not create any value, I just took your £1.

The delays inherent in the legacy banking system that you are complaining about are one of the many reasons that Bitcoin is so successful.
Being able to send money anywhere, and to anyone, almost immediately, with little to no fee is not to be taken lightly.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:17:12
If that is the case, I will simply stop paying fees altogether, until it becomes a problem. 
I was under the impression that pools were already able to choose things like minimum txfee to be included in their blocks.

The rate of new Bitcoin is 25 BTC per 10 minutes (3600 per day), and the price has been roughly stable at $115 for the past few days. That's $414,000 added to Bitcoins market cap every day. 
Does this mean that the difference between FIAT to BTC and BTC to FIAT transactions is around that $414,000 figure every day?

I'm on holiday in Singapore this week. Bought cake and coffee for four at the Artistry Cafe(0.16btc), and then two iced lattes at CAD(coffee, art, design?) which was a bargain at 0.03btc after this week's run up. Both transactions were quicker than cash/credit transactions. Took just a second for the merchant to see the payment, and no need to count change for me.

On bitcoinaverage.com if you select any currency other than USD, it shows the average USD price in that currency too. 
ie, if you select EUR, it shows you the average EUR price, and then underneath displays the USD average converted to EUR so you can compare.

That would appear not to be the case. Armoury allows you to set the fee manually each time you send a transaction. I usually set it to around 0.5-1 cent each time, and I have never not been included in the next 1-2 blocks (over maybe 50 transactions).

Is there ever any issue with wallet back ups and updating your wallet client? 
I mean is it possible a future patch of Armory could cause my wallet backups to be unreadable, or can I safely assume that if I forget about my bitcoin for a year, come back and my wallet backup will definately load into Armoury.
