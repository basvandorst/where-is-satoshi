and what does that taste like?

Why? What's she saying about me?

Ahoy-hoy, I will optical telegraph you the details forthwith.

Not middle class, nouveau riche, which is possibly even more hideously revolting in the eyes of the nobs.

I had a similar issue, except he wanted me to send to their own address rather than using escrow. 
Opened a call with support right there even before he started claiming to have paid up and getting abusive.
You seem to be fighting LBC support at the moment, why not keep in contact and work with them? They're decent people trying to get the right result.

In the O'Rourke house, they call them "uh-oh's"

bought at the peak also, but buying to spend so just need it to climb back to where it was rather than wait for any gains &gt;.&lt; 
patience was never one of my virtues! :D

a woolly hat and a dog turd walk into a bar, the barman says "sorry boys, I can't serve either of you, you'll have to leave".
The hat is shocked and asks "why we've just come for a quiet drink, what on earth could the problem be?" 
To which the barman replies "well you're off you head, and your mates steaming".

that's a bit sad guys, why not just give each other rings without diamonds in them? 
It's not just a gift to exchange, it's also a constant declaration to the world saying you are dedicated to your life partner, that part is the real gift.

Just buying in does seem to be a massive hurdle and is at the moment designed to rip potential buyers off.
Best results I've had has been using  where I at least (eventually) managed to get some BTC. However at what cost, well at least £28 more expensive per coin than MtGox that's at what cost. 
Just looking into the other suggestion I've seen for UK users like myself,  - 
vendors there seem to be almost competing, but still with a £14.10 PER COIN markup over Mtgox prices. 
Just to re-iterate, these are not even one off fee's like if you were buying ANY other currency, this is per BTC! 
Bitcoin is pure pie in the sky right now, this revolution is too bloody expensive.......unless I want something really exotic off deepweb.

mainly your US media, my flesh and blood wife likes a program called Law and Order: SVU . 
I happened to be watching [this one]( with her.
I could not tear my eyes away from the screen of this total hatchet job! It's official, not only am I obviously a drug baron for using BTC and deepweb, I'm now apparently also a child abductor (or at the very least an enabler for one). 
C'mon corporate media, what did I ever do to you? Is this about me seeing piratebay and TVlinks on the side? Hey it's not my fault you value your region exclusivity over my desire to consume your content, meet me half way FFS!

it's full of scammers though so watch yourself on there, even if you stick with escrow a non paying buyer means I have my BTC tied up for 48 hours before I can open a dispute.

That's like me asking you when I'll get a pay rise at my job. I don't know where your income comes from or what currency you are currently paid in. 
I suppose the other big factor is whether you can buy all your goods with BTC.
Basically, when you no longer need to use another currency, is when you wont be worried on a day to day basis about how it's performing against the others. 
That day might NEVER come, so all anyone can do is talk theory right now. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:10:41
Probably when the majority of your income is already BTC
@_date: 2013-07-05 09:48:12
  
Is pretty good and incredibly easy if you don't mind paying a little extra to a middle person. 
Just stick to the escrow function, never release or finalize the deal early for anyone under any circumstance. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:05:48
It's okay, if not you doing this to the market then it would have been my fault.

you agree to the warden and it's functions when you accept the EULA. 
I'm not going to comment on the legality of this malware, as I have no legal knowledge at all......probably depends where in the world you were when you were part of the botnet.....but it's nothing like Warden which you were at least aware of and so able to choose if you wished to continue to run any Blizzard software.

You don't always need to buy a whole coin. I've seen a few vendors on localbitcoin selling small amounts. Good to start small anyway.

Or opt out.

I hate these spikes, they always seem to correspond with me just wanting to bloody buy some stuff. 
Holding out as I know sods law dictates that it will drop again within moments of me paying for coin, probably while I'm waiting for them to hit my wallet &gt;.&lt;
