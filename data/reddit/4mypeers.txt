This is redubdant, as you valued them both in usd. 
Considering compounding factors the profitability of binance would not have been possible without the nasdaq. 
Think gold and fiat one could not exist without the other and in the case of crypto , one is entirely reliant on the other in regards to its inherent value. 
When you start asking for the price of goods and services in crypto instead of fiat, instead of asking how much is crypto in usd, then it will be an apples to apples comparison. Not hate just an unfair comparison in my opinion. Give it sometime still early days.
Edit:binance/bitcoin para. 1

What happens to bitcoin when the wallet holder dies or forget their info? It is lost...forever.
What happens when a country prints to much money? Inflation.
Its almost like those big bad banking fat cats have worked out how to maintain a somewhat sustainable means of exchange... But sure, an ever reducing limited supply currency that is lost forever when its owner dies or forgets their password.... seems sustainable to me. Topkek

Brother, we have inflation, Memento mori and when they forget to write down their password and die as with their body their bitcoin will also be gone forever. Welcome to the meat grinder, pump and dump until all the bitcoin is lost forever, until then endeavour to profit as much as you can from the idealists.
