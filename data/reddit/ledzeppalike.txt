I used to run a full node but the network usage made my internet connection unusable. Is there some application I can use to automatically run bitcoin on a schedule so I can leave it open while at work but have a usable network when I'm at home?

Thank you! I will also be giving my father and BIL 1.0 Bitcoins each this Christmas, I was about to post asking if there was a quick summary of it, yours seems to do the trick.

Make the most popular currency icons larger and fewer decimal places on value.. Perhaps top row of currencies have most popular 3 or 4 a few times larger than the rest. Makes it a more easier to read quickly site.

In the UK you can use  which allows GBP deposits and withdrawals as cash sent via Royal Mail.

Apologies for the late reply, I was awaiting my first GBP withdrawal from them. But yes I can confirm they seem to be legit. I received £200 cash via Royal Mail special delivery today. Any questions feel free to ask.
