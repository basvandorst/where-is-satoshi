How about Wikimedia foundation? (Go ahead and give my 100 bits to them)

$5K is not really outlandish at all. Most states require money transmitter licenses for companies dealing as bitcoin intermediaries, and the fees associated with those licenses are routinely $5K+.

I'm not sure whom you're quoting, or why you think that minimal license fees are equivalent to eye gouging, but this sounds like the same hyperbole that I keep hearing about these regs. I still haven't heard a cogent argument against them yet although I'm certainly receptive and listening. All I've heard so far is that the regs require fiduciaries to be registered and responsible; I don't know why that's a bad thing.

I could make up some number to estimate the cost, but honestly I don't remember an exact number, and I no longer have the info compiled. If you look around the internet though, other people have done most of the work for you. e.g.

bullshit - I have read these laws (yes, all of them), and the licenses do not aggregate to $2M.
edit: Depends over what period of time and what size company too - lots of the license renewals include charges related to the amount of business done in the state over the past year, or something similar, that could bring the costs up substantially. And other stuff I'm not considering . . .
