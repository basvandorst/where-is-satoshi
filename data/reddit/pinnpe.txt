And it's free to try :P

David keeps saying that because it's not that really important, a secured decentralized internet is more important. SAFEcoin is like messaging (they already did messaging for the SAFE network). Right now you can try it out

Safecoin is for storage, dns and computing. Food for thought, when safecoin is out everybody can farm it, by providing computing resources, this means that more people will hold it in comparison to every other altcoin out there. The SAFE Network in itself is super valuable nobody besides you can delete your data, you can register a domain by yourself (no godaddy) and you can store files securely, reason enough to get involved.

This is not some digital ocean slices, this is you download software install it. You login on that internet with nobody's permission and you can store your data. You don't need godaddy to register a domain and if you create an app it can run on the SAFE Network FOREVER, you'll even get paid by the network. 
Silkroad got shut down because it had a webhost, with this a worldwide network is the webhost and only can take down data that you uploaded:
Here's is the real deal

They say that bitcoin is for pedofiles, but it's only when we compete with each other that we fuck with miners.
I coulden't find a job, but I had a few ASIC's so I mined my own business.

Hmmmm another investment advice i can give is:
You can get it on bittrex. 
You can get to know more about it, by looking here:
Please keep in mind this start skyrocketing 1.5 years from now, so have patience, but the dev is a real rockstar.
Goodluck and have a nice day bro, always bet on the resourcedbased crypto's. :P

I use it like it and never had a problem with them. Highly recommended. Btw you don't have to keep your money on the exchange
@_date: 2017-02-24 08:21:37
I only give investment advice of:
I'll tell you my reasoning: 
Maidsafecoin has been in the top 10 for 2 years, between $0.16 and $0.21. It's the only coin besides NEM and Ripple that are below $1, but the Available Supply tells you why NEM and Ripple are there. 37 Billion Ripple, 9 Billion NEM and 452 Million Maidsafecoins. 
Maidsafecoin is a proxy of SAFEcoin which will be a resourcedbased money. 
Maidsafe just had Devcon1 and has weekly updates
Everything we love in the world runs in the cloud, but the thing is it cost whoever created that app money on a monthly bases. The thing is when you put your app on the SAFE Network you pay a one time fee and you can even make money if your app is used often. I'll stop here, but if you don't have this in your portfolio, this is Amazon/Google/Facebook/Godaddy/Cloudflare all wrapped in one package. 
Good luck and another advice, only invest in resourced based cryptocurrencies. If a coin is just a coin, it's a religion, if you can use it to store data on the internet, it's a resourceful tool.

Is there also going to be a whitelabel version of Kraken?

The idea is to create a prototype phone and make a promo video with that money. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 07:54:36
Put it on Alexandria.media

You can play around with this right now:
@_date: 2016-09-12 06:17:35
Luckily you store them in blockchain.info's wallet these are not just your avarage coins. Your coins work on the Omni platform, you can see your coins here:
You can also see them here by just copying your address in the balance check. 
You can import your wallet in omniwallet and then your able to send your Maidsafecoins. Keep in mind you can only send these coins to some one who has the privatekeys to that bitcoin address. 
In the future you can exchange your Maidsafecoins for SAFEcoin 1:1. With SAFEcoin you'll be able to register domain names (that the public ID thing in the video I send you). You can store data and you'll be able to buy computing. 
I don't give financial advice, but if I had $100000 right now I would invest it all in Maidsafecoins? Why? because it's resourced based money, it's not just another silly cryptocurrency with a hardcap and digital scarcity on it's forehead. 
Feel free to ask anything, you can join the forum and ask smart people more here:

I don't have Trezor. This is how you can export your privatekey from Trezor:
It's not for the faint of heart or maybe contact Trezor.

If you got the bitcoin address, you can check it on blockchain.info, if their are still bitcoins on the address. Be sure to have a anti-virus computer running on your computer to detect keyloggers. Good luck :P

Wow! that 40 BTC would enable me to finance my startup. Now it will take me 12 months before I have the money. Who said you can't buy time?

The internet always remembers you, trust is your only connection to other people. Just sick and real stupid to think that you can outsmart people.
