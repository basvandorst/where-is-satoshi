I did, but not by much though. Still in the game though, so hope I am a millionaire in 10 years. Fingers Crossed.

I first learned about Bitcoin in mid 2012. I was willing to put in about $100 in.
There was absolutely no way to buy it from my country, so I couldn't. Fuck.

Was in Pakistan. Most exchanges still don't accept customers from there.
Eventually, a local exchange opened up in 2016.

Invest them somewhere else. Put them in a medium to low risk mutual fund portfolio. If you have $1 million, you could easily average $50k - $70k per year.
With residual income coming; start working on something you've dreamed of.

I don't understand why these purchases are now considered "expensive" purchases.
Bitcoin is a currency. The value of bitcoin at the time of purchase was different than it is now.
When you bought those water bottles; you would have lost the same amount of total value if you had paid in some other currency.
The only difference is, BTC increased in value significantly. Something that could not have been foreseen.
