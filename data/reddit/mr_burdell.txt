I think the idea is that miners should be setting policy and developers should be writing these APIs. If developers set a default policy and most miners use it because they are lazy, then it could be claimed that the developers have some control over the policy in the network. The developers don't want to have control over policy. 
So the fact that it's easy is as far as the developers want to go... the miners should take it from there and build a small daemon that controls their own policy.

this isn't unique to blockchain.info. The Bitcoin protocol checks that time stamps are within a certain range, but there's no check that they are always increasing. this means the real blockchain can contain blocks where the time stamps are inaccurate. so in this case there is nothing wrong with blockchain.info, it's showing the real data from the blockchain

you could detect it based on your payouts.  Based on difficulty and your personal hashrate, you can estimate how much you will get paid.  If they aren't paying you enough, then you know they're doing something fishy.

I agree that this kind of method would only help against the broad attacks of brainwallets and not help any targeted attacks.  I also don't personally think the government is who you need to hide from (I understand that opinion doesn't hold for everyone).
The best idea would be to get rid of brainwallets, but because they exist and people like the idea of only having to memorize a phrase, people will continue to use them.  Especially new users that don't understand entropy and how brainwallets are attacked.

It's hard to tell exactly what they're doing without making all the transactions on the blockchain or showing each individual person their own addresses.
There are a list of addresses in Coinbase, however I don't think the coins are stored on those addresses, they're just for depositing.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:44:17
The biggest issue with brainwallets vs normal passwords is that there is no service behind it.  If I create a shitty password, an 8 char dictionary word for my google account, it probably still won't be hacked because there is a service that google runs that the hackers would need to query.  Google will rate-limit their attempts and it won't be very effective.
Brain wallets on the other hand, can be hacked in a completely passive manner.  You run a script that is essentially the same as generating vanity addresses, except the input comes from a dictionary, or the internet.  The hackers run a web crawler just looking for new phrases and words online.  Then they add some other random things to it that people might try like birthdays or something.  This can all be done offline and they create all the addresses they want in a database.  Once they create this database, they just use their bitcoind to monitor the network for any of their addresses to be used.  Their database just keeps getting bigger.  If someone sends something to an address like:  then they immediately sweep the address.  You can test it by sending a trivial amount of BTC to that address.
So the main issue is that even though you are creating entropy, it's still not enough and you're using the same dictionaries and sources for words that everyone else is.  You need to get a phrase or seed that has provable entropy.  Flip a coin 256 times, roll a 6 sided die 100 times, or make a list of 2000 or more words and roll a die in some way to select 15-20 words from the list (but don't select them on your own to "make it memorable").  Then write that number (or words) down on a piece of paper or etch it in some metal.  This could actually be better than using a computer because you wouldn't be relying on a pseudorandom number generator, it would be real randomness from the physical world.

They could have been slowly operating a fractional reserve. If this was the case, then they basically loaned out coins they should have kept for other users, so when there was a run on gox, they didn't have any more coins. Also, there would be no addresses on the blockchain for them to point to, they just say they are basically out of coins and they don't even really have a cold wallet.
If I remember correctly from my high school economics classes, normal banks can operate on somewhere in the range of only 5-10% of deposits in reserve with no problems.  Gox could have had less, so it's possible they only have a couple thousand coins.
Long term, this would imply that Gox was artificially keeping the price of bitcoins low all along, because they basically increased the total supply. Most of the coins could have been loaned out before the price skyrocketed, and by now they're completely underwater because they loaned out coins when they were less than 100th the current price.  
This could also be why over the last few months gox was always significantly higher than the other exchanges.  If gox was trying to arbitrage to get back in control of their debts. (unless I'm getting that backwards... it gets confusing which way these things would push the price)

The other thing to keep in mind is that until one of the doublespends is actually included in a block, it's unknown which will become a doublespend and which will become the real transaction, so a transaction that's listed in the "Removed" tab could still get confirmed if the conflicting transaction hasn't been confirmed either.  I'll work on adding some descriptions and more information around what everything is displaying.
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:23:48
Good point... I'll add one soon.  For now, here's a list:
UCvin = transaction where one of the inputs has not yet been confirmed when the transaction was received
Free = Outputs are above 0.01 bitcoin, so the transaction fee shouldn't be necessary (obviously this depends if miner policies reflect that)
NoFee = transaction that requires a fee but has none
LowFee = transaction requires a fee but it is too low (&lt;0.00001)
Mid Fee = transaction requires a fee but it is using the new fee standards (&lt;0.0001, &gt;0.00001)
SizeFee = transaction fee is too low based on the size of the transaction in kb
Counterparty = counterparty transaction
Dice sites should be obvious
Dust = one of the outputs is less than about 5000 sat
Let me know if you have any more specific questions... some transactions could be classified with multiple tags and it just depends on the order they're checked.

I've set up a tracker that is more up to date than blockchain.  There are some entities that I can't identify, however I can reasonably identify that they are separate entities, so I've given them code names.  There are a couple addresses that some people are confusing as GHash splitting into stealth addresses, however it looks more like a couple large miners gave up mining with GHash to go on their own.
Also, the IP address on the blockchain.info transactions and blocks is mostly worthless and isn't a good way to correlate pools.

I was thinking about this, and it could be something related to restarting a database.  If they had to resync and basically double counted 70 blocks, then maybe they counted those blocks as orphaned even though they were just going back over the main chain.
I would expect a lot of miners would be freaking out about this if it were accurate... that's over $800K of lost income.

I think "pool34" is large investors, not a traditional pool.  They never spend any coins (well over a couple million USD worth now).  That implies that they don't have to pay anyone for shares/dividends/loans/maintenance.
I think it's possible MimPd could be BitFury. BitFury recently announced they were moving hashrate away from GHash.  If not them, it could be some other cloud provider splitting off on their own.

I didn't say the price of bitcoins had anything to do with cost of mining. I think it will come down to whether it's more profitable to mine large blocks with higher orphan rate or mine small blocks with low orphan rate. we should hope that large blocks are more profitable or else we'll never get above the 7tx per second maximum.
@_date: 2014-06-22 04:03:16
I believe it has to do with latency to upload a larger block to the network, which has the potential to cause a slightly higher percentage of orphaned blocks.  If 100K delays a block by 1 second on average, then I think the potential loss of income is about 1 second divided by 10 minutes times the value of a block.  so (1/600)*25 = 0.042 BTC.  which means if the tx fees for 100Kb of data is greater than that number, then it would be worth it to the miner to make the larger block.  I'm not sure how to calculate the real latency per Kb extra though, 1 second per 100kb is just an example.

The servers don't implement SPV, the client does the SPV verification.
The servers can be set up by anyone and there are 20+ public servers being run by random people.  The client then performs SPV verification on the data received from the servers.  The client can verify that any headers provided by the server are not fake/low difficulty and that transactions provided are included in the real headers.
I believe there is a possibility of withholding transactions from clients by the servers which could be undetected by the client.  If you're worried about that specific attack, then you would need to verify if transactions exist through another channel.
That is the correct source repository if you'd like to run your own server.

I've been working on similar site where I've broken the unknowns into separate entities where blocks can be linked even if the entity is not known.  I've given several of them code names.
If anyone can help identify any of the pools I have marked with a code name, let me know and I can update it.
I don't think a large pool trying to hide their hashrate would be very effective due to the pool members being able to track which blocks their payouts are coming from.  Also, if a pool isn't disclosing their blocks, then the pool members may not know if the pool is lying to them about what it owes the members.  If a pool does try to hide a small percentage of blocks by not paying their normal address, pool members would also notice a lower than expected payout.

you could use shamirs secret sharing to split the password on a single bip38 wallet, or you could create a multisig bitcoin address.
To create a multisig address, you need the public keys for each private key involved.  Typically, with a bip38 encrypted private key, the public key is not available unless decrypted.  So if the bip38 encrypted key was paired with the decrypted pub keys instead of the decrypted addresses, then it would be easy to set that up.

Just this past week while everyone was freaking out about GHash they increased their block limit from 350K to 750K now (at least according to my statistics).  
As of now, it looks like Cloudhashing is the worst with a 250K max blocksize.  BTC Guild has a max of 500K.  Some of the other smaller pools have a max of 350K.
Eligius and DiscusFish are the best with 900K-1M max blocksizes.

I believe this address is the same entity as this address: 1MimPd6LrPKGftPRHWdfk8S3KYBfN4ELnD
It appears to be someone that was mining at GHash and is now mining on their own.  I'd be interested to see a case on why these addresses belong to GHash though.  I don't think they do.
Edit: here's an example proving that these two addresses belong to the same person: 
I only see GHash paying these addresses, not a mixing of their funds.
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:20:49
I'm assuming it's an individual mining organization that realized they have a high enough hashrate that they can start mining on their own without significantly decreased profits.
If it's actually GHash trying to hide some hashrate, then I would assume that miners would slowly realize they are getting lower than expected returns and move away from GHash.  So I don't think it would benefit GHash to attempt that.

BIP32 doesn't define the wallet structure, so even wallets that support BIP32 may not be compatible with each other.  See BIP43 and BIP44 for examples of what the structure will look like.

@_date: 2014-03-06 03:30:13
you're not missing anything, but there are a lot of ways to accomplish the same thing or try to hide what you're doing... basically, it goes back to why you wait for confirmations before you accept a transaction as valid unless you want to analyze each transaction.
I broadcasted that tx earlier today to see what happens (and to see if I could create a valid tx with a locktime).  I had expected the nodes to reject even accepting it until the locktime was valid, however it was accepted into the network and is visible on many blockchain searching sites, and in my client.  The thing I realized is that without parsing the raw transaction, you can't see the locktime anywhere.  It just looks like a stuck transaction.

Stratum is the protocol used to connect from the client to the servers to exchange data.  This is similar to how you connect to reddit using HTTP/HTTPS protocols to exchange data.
The method of SPV verification is to download the headers, verify that they form a chain, verify that the difficulty matches the required difficulty.  Then request transactions from your wallet based on addresses.  When you receive a transaction, the client performs a verification using the merkle root contained in the block headers to ensure that the transaction received is actually contained in a header that was verified.
As far as I know, this is the same way SPV is done in any SPV client.

@_date: 2014-01-09 16:06:55
that's fair, however it's not specific to electrum.
to protect against that, most wallets (including electrum) can be set up in an online (watch only) and offline modes. You create the transaction and sign it offline, then transfer only the transaction to the online system to broadcast it to the network.  
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:13:00
The current plan is that users won't need to generate a new seed, the old ones will still be supported.  However the current electrum seeds use uncompressed pub keys, so transactions are bigger, which can cost more.  So once the new wallets are supported, it will be a good idea to move funds to the new wallets so that it costs less in transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:15:34
couple points:  I like the interface.  Like others have said, if it doesn't send anything, then don't use the seed, use the public key.
also, it doesn't look like it generates the change addresses? and I haven't loaded a wallet with funds yet, but it looks like you choose to generate the addresses in the config?  it should generate them automatically based on the default of 5 address gap limit as they get used. If the addresses have been used, and they are down to 0 balance, they can be hidden, which helps prevent users from reusing addresses.

there wouldn't be massive pools competing for large incomes, but it would still work just fine
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:51:25
Ok, so I had some other ideas since I posted this.  Basically, for people that don't host their own services yet, then they would need to use a onename.io or bitiom.net "email representation" until other services supported this.
To solve the problem of reusing addresses, this could use a BIP32 public key chain instead of a single address.  It would be simple to look it up and return an error if there isn't a result, so if someone tried to send to my gmail, it would fail and they would have to ask me for the right address or find a real bitcoin address of mine to send to.
The TXT record could be something like "type=[address,bip32public chain];address=1asdfasdf...;key=sdafafd..."
I'm still unsure of a proper way to sign this other than just rely on dnssec.  Eitherway, if you're that paranoid about the network you're on, you need to get confirmation from the receiver that you're sending to the proper address anyway, either with a PGP signed message or some other trusted channel.  I don't think DNS is any worse than some other options and it definitely is a usability improvement.
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:55:18
yes, that's possible. especially because many of the entities I identified are not known. Pretty much any of those entities could be part of any other known or unknown entity. that's part of the reason I'd like to identify those entities to be able to determine if anything shady is going on.

@_date: 2014-05-30 01:35:39
An additional point: the longest chain counts as the chain of blocks with the "most work", which doesn't necessarily match to the chain with the most number of blocks.  
This probably wouldn't happen with bitcoin because there are so many miners and the difficulty is so high, however it could with some altcoins, a single block with a very high difficulty could orphan several blocks in a chain.  You can sometimes see this happen with multipools that have high hashrates hopping between coins and solving blocks with very high difficulty.
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:20:34

So building on that, I think name should go with a lookup of name._bitcoin.domain.com.
It might be worthwhile to submit something like this as a BIP to come up with a standard.

I don't think Bitcoin is able to replace things like credit cards and cash to pay over the counter.  However, it can certainly be used to transmit money, exchange money, pay back acquaintances, etc.  For a lot of consumer transactions, credit cards and whatever comes after that can't be replaced by bitcoin.  However, it enables new things like "prepaid" credit cards that can be refilled on the fly and without a bank account or large fees.
For example, there is no easy way for my roommates to pay me back each month after I pay the full rent. They either write me a check (which I accept because I am familiar with them), they use online services that take a fee or limit withdrawals, or send bank transfers if we happen to have the same bank. With bitcoin, you click a button and have the money within an hour.
If you're using bitcoin to buy things in person instead of credit cards or cash, I think you're trying to make it be something that it's not.  There are still plenty of uses for it.
The security aspect is slowly changing.  Things like the trezor will make it simpler to properly secure bitcoin wallets for normal end users.  Writing down a 12-25 word seed and locking it away is simple enough for anyone to do to back up the wallets. And it's much cheaper (or should be when in mass production) than a separate computer dedicated to offline transactions.
As for funding a kickstarter project, delays like the trezor are nothing unique to bitcoin.  The mining rigs are the same thing, however timing is much more critical, so people get angrier faster. Even kickstarter projects won't allow refunds as far as I'm aware.

I believe the way message signing (specific to the type of keys bitcoin uses) works is that if you have the message and the signature, you can produce the public key.  Which you can then hash to get the address.  So you don't need to provide the public key along with the message because it can be computed.

the amount of entropy would be the number of possible SSNs not the number of currently used SSNs, unless there is a database of those numbers.
You can add a couple bits of entropy just by making it a choice of SSN/Drivers License Num/Passport Number/etc (which would also need to be encoded somehow for the entropy to be passed on)
The main point here is to make it default and easy to add extra entropy, which normal end users don't understand.  However that's done, it would need to be tied back to something that doesn't change or is very memorable.  Otherwise, people will go back to using the simple brainwallet idea and will continue to lose their bitcoins.

I think the problem is people don't understand that by joining a pool, the pool owners are the ones actually creating the block with transactions.  It's easy to set up a miner and just point it at a pool, where if you create your own blocks, you have to have the full blockchain and bitcoind running.
One solution is to create mini pools and distribute the block creation, however still have bigger pools that they join.  I can't tell if people just like the low variance or if they don't understand that by joining a smaller pool they aren't actually going to make less BTC long term.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:08:35
I believe the idea is that there are fewer resources required with respect to the value being created by moving large values in single outputs.  For small outputs, the unspent transaction output set gets larger by a significant amount, so it requires more resources.  
This is also why only the outputs are checked for dust, not the inputs.  Cleaning up dust is helping the network by reducing the utxo size.

I updated a couple.  One that's definitely missing is p2pool, but the detection method doesn't really fit in that json... can I assume blockchain.info is detecting p2pool some other way already?

There's another detailed breakdown here: 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:52:39
This only goes so far. Once block rewards get small enough, the transaction fees will also have to cover the cost of mining.  You're not including that here because the block reward covers the cost of the mining and the transaction fee is covering the cost of the upload delay (which is a direct relationship per transaction). When the block reward is negligible (with respect to potential earnings from tx fees), then you need more transaction fees to cover the cost of mining in addition to the upload costs, so you would be willing to give up the chance of being orphaned by a small value block to be able to upload a larger value block.

FYI: my server is having some issues today... the blocks are backed up in a queue, so the data isn't quite live.
I accidentally imported all the transactions to my database with a flag that marked them as in the mempool (which means the front page has incorrect data)... my server is currently going through all the transactions and marking them in blocks correctly.  It's going to take a few hours to catch up...
Anyway, about the pools: I don't think it's worth looking at the 24 hour charts because of variance... but if people really want to see that, I'll add it as an option when my databases finish updating.... it's basically going to look exactly the same as blockchain.info though.
@_date: 2014-06-22 03:55:54
possibly, but that would give people an incentive to continue to mine even without massive compensation... so I have no idea how it would all work out.

I meant block size limit.  It's a setting that the miners use to limit the size of their blocks.  If you look at all the blocks broadcast by a specific miner, you can see several that are 249.xxxK, 349.xxxK, etc, so you can determine what their settings are most likely set to.

it's not more or less difficult to mine transactions. the miners want small or fewer transactions due to the time it takes to broadcast a block to the network, which correlates with size of transactions included in the block 
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:38:22
agreed.  Also, I think 51/2 is too high.  somewhere around 15-20% max per pool.  Obviously something like p2pool is even better.
One of the main problems with smaller pools is higher variance, which people apparently don't like, although if p2pool gets large enough, then it would help with the variance.

They will be cached from the first connection to the server.  Currently, I'm not completely sure what the warning is.  It may just silently fail the connection to that server and go to the next one in the list of known servers.
As for the server list, there is a hard coded list of default stable public servers (I think there are about 10 in the list), and then it receives a list of currently available servers from the servers that it connects to.  The servers list is then stored in the config file for future start ups of the program.
If you have your own server, or know of a trusted/non-public server, you can disable auto-connect and connect directly to the server you want.  You can also specify this on the command line with -s.  If you have a trusted server and you don't want to enable the feature where it checks multiple servers, I think the command line flag is -1 (number one, not letter L)

The stale/reject rate is for internal accounting of the pool, so as long as everyone has similar rates, then it shouldn't be an issue.  You shouldn't compare across pools, only within a single pool.
To compare pools, you should look at the block orphan rate.  If a pool has a much higher block orphan rate, that would be an issue.  If you look at the statistics here:  you can see that GHash actually has a relatively high orphan rate.

I'm not sure of all the methods to detect this, however that was one of the reasons I listed the "Last Seen" column.  Which I believe would go up if a pool was mining a chain on the side but had a high hash rate.  For example, if GHash disappeared for 50-100 blocks, you could assume something shady is going on.  (although that could also happen if they were having innocent technical issues or being DDOS'd so it's not a sure way to detect anything either)

I haven't done the calculations myself, but if you do the calculation of losing x milliseconds per kb in a block, you can calculate the minimum fee per kb that a miner should accept to remain profitable. although, at the same time, including more tx can increase the utility of the network which can contribute to the value of bitcoin. that isn't as easy to calculate though.

adding a ssn to any passphrase should increase the bits of entropy by about 30, right? 
2^30 ~= 1000000000
a birthdate is probably less, especially if age is guessable.  So it's not perfect, but it's much better than using just a passphrase and would be safer than having people using their normal "use one password everywhere" password in brainwallet.org and assuming because they put a ! instead of an i somewhere that it's safe.
So I agree that completely random is better, but this idea would be to protect the people that don't understand that and like the idea of a brainwallet.

for example: 
This transaction looks fine, however it won't confirm because it has a lock on it until block 290000... so if I sent one like this to you, then I could rebroadcast another one and you would never get anything.  Or, if you're checking for locktime, I could broadcast another transaction that spends the outputs of that transaction, which won't be included in a block until the first transaction has been included.

The deterministic keys are used to create multiple addresses.  So just because it's more entropy than one address, you want higher entropy on your master private key.  Breaking a single public address is not the same as breaking a bip32 chain.

This is true.  I set the block length on mempool.info to 1008 minimum to reduce the random variance.  I haven't done the math, but if someone gets close to 40-50% (GHash), then I think looking at only a day will contain too much variance.
However, you can tell that GHash is going back up because the 1008 rate is higher than the 2016 rate.  While it was going down, it was the opposite.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:03:21
if a single entity has more than 50% of the network, even if they are using p2pool, then the same risks still exist.  So if p2pool has 55% of the network, but GHash has 99% of p2pool, there would still be a problem.

We've recently created this site as a way to provide more insight into the bitcoin network.
Current features (more planned):
Home page: Live list of transactions contained in the mempool (this could differ between nodes).  Each transaction is tagged with various attributes that could affect the transaction being included in blocks by miners.
Removed page: List of transactions that have been removed from the mempool and were not included in a block.  This could
 be due to doublespends, invalidated transactions due to parent doublespends, malleated transactions, daemon restart, etc.
Pools page: Information on pools related to the blocks they've found.  Some of the pools have been classified as a single entity with a codename.  These unknown entities have been identified because they have found multiple blocks which can be linked together in some way, so they will be tracked as a single entity.  The methods to link blocks vary by pool/entity, however they are mostly linked via payout addresses, unique coinbase strings, or combination of both.
Other reddit users involved with the project include and so they should be able to help answer any questions.

The miners set the block timestamps and the network will accept blocks with times that are out of sync up to some limit.  Not sure what the exact limit is.
You can tell that they came in a certain order though due to each block containing the previous block's hash.

once you double spend the original coins using different transactions on each chain, then you've successfully split the coins.  if you don't properly doublespend a tx and it gets into both chains with the same hash, then the coins are not safely split.  It's safe to do this since you can try as many times as you want by spending to yourself and attempting to doublespend until it works.

You're making an assumption that an address can only be controlled by a single individual.  There are at least two ways an address can hold Bitcoins "owned" by multiple individuals.  The address can be held by a corporation like coinbase as a wallet provider for multiple individuals or an exchange where multiple individuals have bitcoin that could be stored in a single address.  Or an address can represent a script that requires multiple individuals to cooperate to control the coins, which could represent any real world contract about the ownership of those coins.

you should be able to try some other servers and see if there are servers that don't know about your transaction. I know some servers have set their relay fee higher than normal due to the spam transactions, so you should be able to find one that you can send another tx with a higher fee.

you can import or sweep private keys, but you can't import a full wallet.dat file.
the main issue is that electrum uses a deterministic seed to create all addresses to make backups very simple. however any imported addresses will not be protected by the seed backup. so it's preferable to send the btc to the electrum wallet (or use the sweep function) instead of importing keys.

there have been bugs in block explorers where invalid tx or blocks show up on their site and API (blockchain.info for example).

there is more demand for bitcoin than there are bitcoins available at the previous prices... price goes up until supply equals demand.  Arbitrage between markets keeps the prices relatively in check. (gox is an exception there due to their fees and process for extracting fiat)
if you see it fall too much, then the supply is going to skyrocket due to people running away from the popping bubble, which will cause a massive dip. then once it gets low enough, people will want to buy back in because it will probably go back up after a while.  the cycle will just keep repeating, and hopefully stabilize eventually.

vanity addresses are still completely random, you are just generating a lot of addresses and discarding the ones you don't want.  Then you get a completely random private key.
brainwallets are the opposite, you pick a private key and use the address that results after some standard math.
The main thing to remember with vanity addresses is that you don't want anyone creating one for you and giving you the complete private key.  There is a way to do it where you generate a request and then they give you a result that you use to create the final private key that only you have.

Here's an example of how it works, but using MD5 as the hash so no one confuses it with the algorithm that electrum uses:
Lets say you have a seed: 87654
At the beginning, you get these 5 addresses:
md5("87654"): c21bc50362eddc58b7d2b15fccf29a8c
md5("87655"): 143ab9820b9e2b860fcfaee6d16e4028
md5("87656"): 2de68a7c5e3db6a836ab8f5f109416b8
md5("87657"): f2c4fb8e65ddc1002d03dad5c5075905
md5("87658"): 36d2159696a0341457d87e33e9d791c3
electrum then checks the blockchain, lets say you used the last one before and you've spent all the coins already.  since all transactions are public, electrum can see that it's been used, so it makes another 5 addresses using the same algorithm:
md5("87659"): 31a5b26b65b64a6d46efb49dd8b65d47
md5("87660"): a1ce72ac075b1141431d5b5e2d499b44
md5("87661"): ef84fb282dacdf884f40a03089bac3bc
md5("87662"): 6f4374db902e3d345cfc77e4468b7cff
md5("87663"): 16a521186340b585388ac8213267e3f2
It keeps going, and if those addresses have never been used, it stops.  By then you should have all your addresses.  The algorithm I used isn't secure, because it would cause collisions if someone had a seed of 87651 for example.  One way to fix that would be to use the previous hash as the seed for the next iteration.  Electrum also uses a 128 bit number instead of a 5 digit number.
So basically, in my example, you only need the one seed (87654) to recreate all the addresses, and you keep checking the blockchain until there aren't any used.  You should be able to repeat this just by using the same seed and an md5 generator.
Let me know if you have any more questions, I'll try to explain.  Hopefully this didn't just make it even more confusing.

Electrum uses the "gap limit" to look through the addresses from the generated wallet.  If it finds that at one time an address within the gap limit had coins, then it keeps generating more until it finds no more new addresses.  So even if you spend your money and it all moves to change addresses, or new addresses, as long as you keep the same gap limit, restoring an old wallet from the seed will work.
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:49:01
it would probably be better to send the coins from one wallet to the other.  Electrum uses a deterministic wallet, and any imported addresses won't be recoverable.

Either way, mining won't stop then, so it's a moot point.
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:46:41
legal point of view? There are no laws around this yet.
Logically how it would work: mtgox, or some other exchange allows more buys than they actually have in reserve... since if I have bitcoin in the "bank" on an exchange, I don't actually have an address of coins I can go check, there is no verification that the exchanges are not "lending" bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:59:07
hopefully, after all these hearings, it will be easier for the exchanges to work with banks and there will be more than just coinbase as an option with direct ACH transfers.
also, one of coinsetter's goals is to allow exchanging on multiple exchanges from their platform.  Once that's allowed, the price gaps will go way down because they'll allow exchanging fiat between exchanges as easily as BTC... depending on how they implement that though on the backend, it could run in to similar problems that coinbase ran in to yesterday.

I recommend electrum, at electrum.org.
It stores all your sensitive data locally and doesn't need to download the entire blockchain.  It also generates a key based on 12 random words that would let you recover your wallet with just that key.  You could set up the wallet today, write down that key, delete everything from your hard drive and come back in a year with that key and all your bitcoins and transactions would still be there.
Depending on what's important to you, there are some other wallets with varying levels of features: multibit, bitcoin-qt, armoury, etc
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:28:41
localbitcoins has an entirely different model.  I wouldn't really call that an exchange.  Basically, the sellers are all charging a fee, just like the exchanges, but for them to make any money, they have to charge a much higher fee percentage, and they just bake that into the price.  Pretty sure the escrow service takes a fee off that too.

you can definitely change the transaction fees... if there are minimums, it's a limitation of your client.  You can even do 0 fee transactions, however it may take a long time to get picked up in the chain.  I've been setting my fees around 0.0001, and the default in my client was 0.0002

pretty sure I used it correctly... and I don't get your point.  The whole issue with "brainwallets" is that people are bad at picking something that is relatively easy to remember and is also very difficult to guess.  If you let the computer choose the key and then generate something from that key that is more easily remembered, it isn't the same as having a person choose a key based on a word or two they already remember.

electrum doesn't use a brainwallet, it's generated randomly and then a mnemonic is created out of a dictionary of words. If I remember correctly, it's only 128 bits of entropy, instead of 256, but that's still better than brainwallets

Yes, they do match sellers and buyers, however, for each trade on MtGox, there isn't necessarily a transaction in bitcoin/blockchain.  You only actually have bitcoin transactions when you fund your account with bitcoins or withdraw bitcoins.  So they are acting in a way that could increase total number of bitcoins owned.  I'm not sure if that whole process could be audited at all though.

It doesn't go through the blockchain more slowly... it gets accepted into the blockchain more slowly.  Once it gets in the blockchain, it will be confirmed in the next 6 blocks (or whatever number you use as confirmation).
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:15:24
However, there is the possibility of the circulating bitcoins to be more than the maximum actual bitcoins.  Take for example an exchange as big as mtgox.  They don't actually have to have BTC for all the BTC on their order books just like a bank doesn't actually have all the money you're storing with them at any given time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:56:58
however, in this whole process, the bitcoin currency is being diversified and mixed with other currencies... I think this is a good thing.  For the total market cap of bitcoin to expand, you can't have single users holding thousands of bitcoins.  This volatility and cashing out will eventually stabilize and make bitcoin stronger.
@_date: 2013-05-16 12:55:40


@_date: 2013-05-10 16:53:52
Some of the price volatility is due to attacks on a single exchange.  Arbitrage will definitely help with stabilizing the price of bitcoin.  One of the problems with successful arbitrage is getting sufficient funds into all the exchanges multiple currencies.

Escrow means you can't back out (unless going through the process described in OP).  The transaction service provides the exact same service, except that it allows you to cancel.  
So if you meet someone face to face, there is no reason for escrow since the entire transaction can be handled in person.  If they don't show up, or don't provide funds, you walk away and cancel the transaction.

I just thought of a way it could be partially audited: MtGox could publish a list of addresses that they store their coins in and then sign a message with the private keys for each of those addresses as their proof.

I would add to this response that to keep in mind that all transactions are kept on the blockchain.  So once you use one of the initial 5, it creates a new address and since the keys are created in a deterministic way, every time it regenerates, it will check the blockchain for the addresses.  If one is used already, it knows to make more until the gap limit is satisfied by unused addresses.
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:07:24
This is why bitcoin isn't exactly good for micro transactions.  There is a cost for every transaction because it makes the blockchain bigger and miners need to create blocks.  If you want to send a single satoshi, then you need to pay a fee the cost it will take to implement that transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:09:52
You can also set up transactions so the change is sent back to the original address.  This isn't the default and isn't recommended since the private key has been imported, so you lost the security of the paper wallet, but you would still have the paper backup.
You'd have to read the documentation on your bitcoin client on how to set up the change address to be the same as the input address.

paper wallets can be used on computers not connected to a network as well... you create a transaction, sign with the private key, all on an offline computer.  Then, you transfer the signed transaction to a connected PC.  This exposes the public key to a net connected machine, but the paper wallet is still secure.  It's basically the same as armory, but you have the information stored on paper instead of hard drives.
