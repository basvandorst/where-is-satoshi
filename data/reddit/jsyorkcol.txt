Ah ok. Seems like it might be legit then.

The fact that I am getting "free" money, and that you can't cash out unless you meet certain requirements.

Yes, putting a Bitcoin address on your website would be a great way for people to donate without faffing about with PayPal.
If you are a street performer in a large city, you could even put a QR code next to your money hat and any Bitcoin users passing buy would likely pay attention.

So receiving a payment from a reused address could cause their wallet software to malfunction?
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:06:47
Ok, thanks for clarifying.
If it is an accidental feature, does that mean that it could stop working in the future? It seems that the majority of people reuse addresses.

But if they imported the private key into a compatible wallet, the funds would be there?
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:40:09
Am I right in saying that it's a working feature, but not recommended?
I hashed a vanity address and have been using it for a long time with dozens of transactions in and out.

If you want to ease your nerves while you sort this out, enter the Bitcoin address into [blockchain.info]( and you will be able to see your funds.
Sending to a Bitcoin address is nothing to do with the wallet that holds the address.
Worst case scenario you can't get Electrum working, import the private keys into another wallet or restore from the seed words that you created.

We don't know that. It's entirely possible, but I'd say unlikely.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:10:22
Yeah, I heard that the $400 Raspberry Pi wasn't very popular.

Could be more than 2 weeks since it'll be stuck hashing at the old difficulty with much less hash power.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:10:53
Did you get it in Bitcoin to your wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:44:00
Got the wrong word there, my apologies.

But the tasks are literally ticking a box or answering a single question within the 21.co site. You do not get redirected to a survey site or anything.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:50:58
I wonder if anybody has successfully cashed out the $0.60 or so you can earn just from the starting tasks.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:50:28
Which wallet software does not support address reuse?
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:19:43
Genesis coins cannot be moved.
