I recommend that you try [Breez wallet]( If you're on Android you can download the beta [here](
It's a lightning wallet that makes transacting Bitcoin a lot cheaper. The wallet is non-custodial and will automatically open a payment channel with their node with a capacity of 0.01 BTC so that you can immediately receive up to 0.01 BTC from other users of the lightning network. You can also fund the channel with on-chain transactions. This means that you only need to pay on-chain fees when you add funds (when transacting on-chain I recommend that you pay the lowest fee possible, 1 sat/vbyte). Once your funds are in the channel you can transact on the lightning network virtually for free (only 1\~12 sats in fees), and the transactions clear in 3 to 10 seconds in most cases.
The wallet also makes it very easy to transact with other Breez users. If you're on Android you can even pay with NFC.
I recommend this lightning wallet in particular since it's dead simple to use and you can start receiving bitcoin on the lightning network right away. Install it and reply to this post with an invoice, or PM me an invoice. **I'll send you 20 000 sats (0.0002 BTC) as a gift** (here's how to do it: [ Once the app is installed you'll have to wait for it to sync to the blockchain (takes about 10 minutes). After that you'll be able to create an invoice. What's great about Breez is that once you receive those 20 000 sats you can transact them to friends and family who are also on Breez right away without paying high transaction fees (since Breez sets up an inbound channel for you). Transacting to another Breez user only costs [1 sat (0.00000001 BTC)]( and it's near instantaneous.
Breez is still in beta but it works decently well already. There are other lightning wallets too and I recommend that you look into those as well. There's [Wallet of Satoshi]( and there's [Blue Wallet]( but they're both custodial which means that you're not in possession of your funds - they control your funds on your behalf. This is why I recommend Breez. With Breez your funds are always in your control since you're the one holding the keys.
On desktop I recommend [Zap wallet]( You can download the latest Windows version [here](
I highly suggest that you read more about how the lightning network works so that you and other Venezuelans can benefit from it ([ Lightning is permissionless and anonymous. Anyone can use it as long as they have a computer/smartphone and an internet connection.

That's what I love about it. It's the first non-custodial lightning wallet I've used that's so simple that even a non-techie with no knowledge of the lightning network could use it. Kudos to the folks at Breez for simplifying the onboarding process.

I can't recommend Breeze enough. Hands down the fastest and easiest non-custodial LN wallet I've used.

Ugh, they're using BitPay

What about GDPR? According to EU regulations if I request the complete deletion of my account they must fulfill that request.
