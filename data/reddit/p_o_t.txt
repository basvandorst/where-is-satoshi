But with that amount of money wouldn't it make more sense to become a resident in a place that doesn't tax crypto? Or maybe he's so rich he doesn't really care lol.

i doubt it, isnt usdt 1.17 on binance?
@_date: 2018-10-15 04:02:34
probably not until we start pressuring them like basically what happened with segwit. They will have to adopt to it eventually. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:22:44
Yes I realized I made that mistake. Thanks for correcting me though because people rather bash than come with correctness.  
  
But I don't know how I feel about this. This very similair thing happened numerous times last year. Create tether FUD and days later pump. We've seen this before. So Why should we believe tether is actually crashing? I think that can just be FUD so people do FOMO in and then dip comes back in for all those that FOMO'd. If that is the case, I don't think a big dip would happen. Just back down to around 6.5k or so

Find out if he has a hardware wallet. If not one of the best gifts would easily be the ledger nano s   
  
Also be wary of any messages you get and you probably shouldn't try buying any of the actual cryptocurrenices for him because this field can be tricky at times with scammers and hackers. There's also cool Bitcoin art that people sell, I know a lot of bitcoiners would love to own some nice bitcoin art. Gives a nice nostalgic feeling

Nope. Blockchain is generally a distributed ledger. The reason it's decentralized with Bitcoin is because of Bitcoin it's self. The code/rules designed inside Bitcoin is what keeps it decentralized. As of now, Bitcoin is the most decentralized cryptocurrency.  
  
Being decentralized is not that easy. Bitcoin sacrifces other things such as speed and fees to focus on decentralization. Other cryptos may be faster or cheaper but definitely not as decentralized.  
  
Bitcoin highlights decentralization because it's the revolutionary part about it. It's very important this is the main priority.  
  
In this day and era practically nothing is decentralized, meaning it's controlled by a higher authortity. This is very bad for our future.

Blockchain was created with Bitcoin 10 years ago. That being said it's not really new but it is new regarding a secure transaparent method of storing/tranferring data

There are no regulations to Bitcoin. You probably are referring to goverments. Regardless Bitcoin is still publically available to everyone and is borderless. Even if a goverment banned bitcoin you can still use it.... Just like how China banned porn...  
  
I completely disagree with your opinion. Stop selling yourself out to authority. If the masses decided this is the curerncy they want to use, goverments won't have a choice. This is why it has 'revolutionary' capabilties which I notcied you failed to acknowledge with other people.   
  
Everything is based on a consenus so stop trying to spread fear.  
  
Practically everything you speak of is your opinions, even other people called you out on it and you fail to acknowledge that. That hugely discredits you for not being honest with yourself.  
  
No the devs do not decide on adoption. The devs just develop...And based on the development you can get an idea when adoption is coming and it's pretty clear it's not ready for adoption. You are very misled.  
  
Jesus christ your delusional. I have no interest in continueing this with someone with a big ego who thinks there opinions are facts. What a joke.  
  
And you can easily buy bitcoin without being traced dumbass. I have multiple wallets that have zero traceability to my identity. The fact you don't even know how that's possible shows how little you know. Your all talk who tried to sound smart but failed miserably. Do yourself a favor and just walk away before someone who is more intelligent on the topic makes you look like a fool.
@_date: 2018-11-03 06:54:51
What the heck? This wallet has been getting shilled here like all year long. Is this FOMO coming from their team or some shit and everyone has been duped? 
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:37:33
Oh please my reply to him was completely unbias. Explain how I used the word in the wrong way. And its pretty obvious you have emotions invested or else you wouldnt be speaking from a place of judgement. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:46:13
Anyone who gains any type of fame will feel the wrath of the internet that can make you appear in any kind of way they feel like.  
  
I don't care about small talk. If you think he's a bigot that means you have different opinions/views from him, so you should be able to logically argue whatever those opinions/views are or else your also a bigot.
@_date: 2019-01-26 07:33:09
Typical triggered meeble minded person who resorts to insults because they have no logical base. The point of BTC is to take over cash. Not to cash out. You clearly don't understand the white paper. I suggest you watch some videos that explain the purpose of BTC. You're just one of those kids who came here on the hype train 1-2 years ago and you are ONLY here to make a profit.  
  
The point of BTC is to disrupt the banking system, DUH. If BTC gains adoption you won't need to cash out because you can just use BTC to buy things with... But let me stop talking to you because you have no idea what your talking about and you don't even know how BTC works. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:35:46
It is decentralised. Bitcoin did not come from regulators. Regulators took advantage of the chance to sell bitcoin which is completely fine. That's the point of being decentralised. It's for anybody. You don't have to use regulators.  
  
There's no point of talking about first mover advantage in this field when the technology is constantly in advancement. Regardless first mover advantage is irrelevant to talk about. All that matters is the technology and development.  
  
That's not neccessarily true. Mining adjustments exist for a reason. So there kinda always will be incentive. Proof of work seems to work fine and being economically justified is what gives it a real value to even be able to work as a store of value.  
  
That's not a problem that any of the developers are worried about. Maybe to some investors? But definitely not any of the people actually doing the work. I don't see Bitcoin and LN heading that way, it's just your opinion.  
  
Giant companies haven't embraced Bitcoin because they still don't really understand it. It never even hit adoption phase. What's the point of talking about giant companies right now? Doesn't seem like the brains actually care about that right now because it's not the focus right now. They will hop on in an instance when it's in there best business interest and right now it's not but that can easily change... and in my opinion it totally can lose it's hoarder mentality in an instance. I guess you have a different vision. The hoarder mentality is practically a meme. Those also can change in an instance but logically it won't change until people have profited enough or until it's simply more balanced out which makes sense.  
  
Many people been here before you who would disagree. No need to include when you been here to try and make yourself sound better.  There is no struggle at all. Bitcoin is not even trying to gain adoption. That's clearly not the intent right now regarding the development. The devs will make adoption phase a lot more clear to us when it's more ready but they made it clear to us that it is not adoption phase

Your cancel out your own logic. You refuse to read anything related to him and yet you still make a claim about him.  
  
He actually has a lot of great videos and the only reason he gets so much attention is because he speaks his mind and doesn't give a fuck about your opinion unless it's a logical one. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:17:09
This!!! the first sit down they had wasn't productive for Joe. Right now would be way more productive where Joe might actually comprehend this stuff better. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 05:04:07
lol! you seriously don't know how to stay anonymous? I'm not even going to answer that. You clearly are a shill who only comes here to talk shit but you have zero logic about the technology. You can easily buy BTC for cash and nobody will know that's your wallet. On top of that LN is working a lot on fungability but you wouldn't know anything about that
@_date: 2018-11-18 11:17:32
I have to disagree with that. By design, the blockchain IS a decentralized technology or maybe you can consider it a distributed ledger technology, regardless it's still apart of technology. It plays a huge role in Bitcoin since it of course was designed specifically for Bitcoin.   
  
But yeah I agree there is a lot of hype for it in places that might not really have a use for it. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:18:30
Awesome brotha! Two questions, does it only work for micropayments? Or can you still tip someone 100$ or even more?  
  
And is there a reason the only way you can make an account with tippin.me is only by signing up twitter? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:21:34
Would make no difference to you if I have it or not. The point is I hope it drops to 2.5k, not that I almost have it. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:54:42
And keep tagging along if that feeds your ego.
@_date: 2018-12-08 05:07:22
Because I'm just "hoping" for a drop to 2.5k so I can buy in. I will not risk selling if it does not drop because then I would lose even more. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:42:50
Where do you trolls come from? How do those bags feel ? Sounds like it's getting to heavy for you.
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:23:37
Thanks mate, hope those satoshie's aint infected (; cause it's the first thing I ever recieved on reddit lol 
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:44:28
I'm really hoping for a drop to 2.5k so I can finally almost own a full btc 
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:13:35
I'm not new here and been around before BTC ever hit it's first 3k. And I didn't catch any of the knifes on the way down to 3k so I'm not worried about that. Being in the market before the hype came along, it's a lot easier to place your bet as what you think the intrinsic value is when you look at the market and technology.  I'm not really much in the red, didn't really ride the hype train as I boarded before it came. I was just enjoying the ride but didn't sell at the right time.
  
I'm sure you can relate in some kind of way, your still here for a reason
