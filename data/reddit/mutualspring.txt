I think it is a pyramid scheme. We just don't realise it yet.

This gives information for the UK, but I think its largely the same in most countries;

I think you underestimate hot money. The difference between $1600 and $2000 is not enough to put off investors. But if $1600 is anything to go by, might be enough to raise transactions enough to significantly slow the network.

Ooo, I didn't know that. We just had a round of attacks in the UK and it was still BTC

Agreed, it must be so difficult for trade on DNM

I think you misunderstand the blockchain. There is no one to pay the $20 to make the transactions go through. When you make a transaction it is basically queued and processed by a miner when the fee you offered becomes desirable enough.

Why don't you just sell them on an exchange?

How anyone can think some of these coins are worth $100millions is anyones guess. I'm hoping for a huge correction and I'll take up positions once again.

People still use Bitcoin? I thought it was all about Litecoin these days?

I genuinely question its use in the "drug trade." On AB less than half take XMR and I have been doing a sneaky bit of market research and no one reported accepting any more than about 5% of transactions through it.
I think there is definitely a bright future for it in the sin industries. But I think its hard enough for newcomers to understand BTC. Then if you have BTC, unless you are an enthusiast like me, why convert it to XMR to make a transaction that can be done in BTC. Yes the privacy is awesome, but is anyone actually tracking $15 payments for a gram of ecstasy? 
Finally, I am waiting for hacks/ransoms to demand XMR, not seen any as of yet.

I pulled out minutes before the drop from $2800 earlier as I thought we were at the top of that graph. There has been so much media hype. Even here in the UK you have the BBC telling people how to get in on the action. 
I would like to think we are in the bull trap, but I don't know if Crypto follows the traditional patterns.

I don't know how they do it. I couldn't base my business on such a volatile medium of exchange. Its all good when the tickers are green, but when they turn red, half your savings could disappear.

I am based in the UK and I use Bitstamp. The BTC/USD exchange is good enough to balance out any fees. I found most GBP/BTC markets are shit.
