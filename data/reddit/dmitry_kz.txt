Do you use a magic ball to predict certain percentage of raise? Where can I get one?

Take off to the moon maybe?

As I understand that: if you have $10k to invest in BTC. You buy: $2000 value of BTC for example for $17k/BTC than you wait till the price drops to $15k/BTC you buy more BTC for $2000 and so on; you invest portions of your $10k for different prices and eventually you have more BTC for your $10k than if you'd have had if you had bought all in at $17k/BTC.
P.S. This is my understanding, I'm not an expert.

Is Asian market buying from dip Bitcoin now? It's already 12k :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:21:46
Looks like somebody is buying from the dip now. It recovered back to 12k. Asian market maybe?
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:55:54
What are alternatives? I signed up with Gemini but they're still reviewing my identity.
Is using local Bitcoins better and faster in case you know what you are doing? 
*I signed up with Coinbase and they approved me right away, buy I have to wait for bank deposit like 7-10 days. People are saying it's better to use GDAX, but still you have to wait when funds will be available at Coinbase to transfer them. Right?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:16:04
AFAIK, USDT looks like a scam. I wouldn't bother with that.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:02:59
Maybe they are just volunteers, and if the tech is developing then price goes up, they benefit from it. Possibly. I don't know for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:52:15
Can someone experienced explain why BTC/ETH/BCH/LTC draw almost the same pattern on dayly charts?
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:32:01
IDK about new users. But they've been verifying my indentety for couple  weeks already.

Thanks for useful info. Question: can you store altcoins on ledger nano S as well as BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:00:48
You don't need to have Nobel prize to know something will collapse one day.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:21:47
Did I miss something? Where is Daily General Discussion thread?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:01:07
Is there really any difference between ledger and trezor hardwallets? I looked up ledger nano S and it says they can ship it only in March as earliest. Would you recommend trezor wallet over Ledger nano s, or they are almost same? 
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:01:52
Can't you sell on local Bitcoins for cash?
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:04:55
I guess you can either buy directly from coinbase AT CURRENT PRICE using Bank deposit or credit card and pay fee much higher than Gdax or send usd deposit to Gdax and buy at whatever price when the funds will be available at GDAX. I might be wrong, please correct me who's more experienced.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:11:15
For now your  0.00195 BTC is around $20, if you hold this amount in Bitcoin and it gets to 100k, it becomes around $200. Not so much...
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:53:28
Coinbase/GDAX is pure BS. Why would they clear bank deposit for that long as a whole week and it's still pending? I think Gemini concept is much better since they allow you trade right away and block withdrawals until deposit is cleared. It makes much more sense...
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:34:10
A minute of silence who bought the "dip" last few hours or yesterday...
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:11:06
Today is the new day. Have a good one!
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:05:35
You didn't mention the year bro. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:39:11
 
Is this BS article a sign to buy? Lol
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:19:49
Sounds like a new conspiracy theory:)
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:10:10
Thanks for your detailed response! Yeah this market seems to be completely unpredictable!
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:22:59
Lol this!
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:25:35
I didn't say it would happen right away.  But most likely today. I'm not being pessimistic, just look at the past week. $1k up $1 down. Don't you think it's price manipulation?
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:24:07
If you ask it here. Yes, go out now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:36:30
Somebody made a bunch of money...
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:35:09
Yeah. It seems to be getting down there with confidence.

He just said HODL! LMFAO
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:41:36
No. That's why I use Gemini now, but I don't know any other exchange which let you buy with credit card, this is the thing.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:48:21
Get ready for 11k guys!!!

What's your analysis based on?
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:28:42
That spike was nuuuuts!!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:07:05
How do you know for sure?
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:21:24
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:00:33
Credit card?
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:27:45
Edit: before using coinbase read first @_date: 2018-02-05 17:40:18
Probably because they print money out of nothing and most people have to hard work for those money to survive.
*Just my opinion, I might be wrong of course.
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:36:53
Are we expecting $1k rise today and then $1k down again? Those are ridiculous fluctuations!
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:08:26
Hi, guys. I have a question about security. Let's say you have a trezor hard wallet with your BTC on it and you want to access them through Trezor wallet which is on trezor.io website. What happens if their website and all online services go down and won't recover anymore? Is there any way to access your BTC in this case, somehow offline or through other software? Just curious. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:04:27
You guys think it will pass 7k today?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:09:08
They will come back again when the price is high enough. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:44:06
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:35:37
Yeah. $6k! Unbelievable!
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:48:56
Buy 6 MacBooks pro untill it's too late! Lol
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:37:39
Informative and helpful comments will get you upvotes. Just asking for them is not a good idea imo.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:33:43
Yeah. I like Gdax with zero fees but the fact that you have to wait for a week or so to have funds cleared really bothers me. I've got Wells Fargo account, maybe with other banks it's faster.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:58:28
Man, I don't need to have coffee in the morning, just to see huge spikes when I was asleep and that's enough. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:42:22
I think I've seen exactly this message today earlier. WTF? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:34:58

That works. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:28:19
Hi. I have a question about upcoming BTCP fork. I think to get BTCP you'll have to provide your private keys. Is it safe to do so? Is there any chance your BTC will be stolen? Thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:17:29
Use Gemini. Instant buys. And pending withdrawals until the deposit is cleared.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:42:39
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:30:56
Are you asking on Bitcoin subreddit what to buy? IDK, buy some groceries...
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:04:35
It's zero sum game. Somebody has to lose in order somebody to win.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:08:27
Right! It went up to 10k from 9.6k for about 20 minutes. I won't be surprised if it goes back with the same speed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:47:47
Are expectations and fear of coming SEC hearing drive prices so much down or there are any other news?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:50:39
Guys! Seriously! BTC is on sale today! Who could dream of these prices a month ago? ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:48:23
I'm at losses too, let's hodl it and we might enjoy it even more in 2-3 years. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:37:53
I hope it's a joke, otherwise sounds scary.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:51:26
Do you use TA rules? Do you think they really work in Crypto markets? Any advice what to look for to understand these markets better? Thank you!

Please, bro, stop ruining our space mission to the moon! Lol
That was fun to read...ahahhah
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:21:15
Trezor or ledger nano S:
Close to %0 chance of getting scammed.
No limits.
No fees, except transaction fees of course.
No easy access to buying and selling crypto, you'll have to transfer it to exchanges to do that.
No alerts for prices.
I think it's worth it to have peace of mind.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:42:02
* on the moon. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:42:30
It just keeps falling... What do you think guys, the floor at $6.3k or $3.5k?
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:53:08
Now check your bank account. Is there $ 1 million?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:55:54
Sorry for breaking your imaginary world. LMAO ��
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:31:43
We're about to break it!
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:50:52
I bought some. I think people who believe that crypto will survive and grow in long term are buying right now.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:35:10
This BTC volatility is f ridiculous! I'm happy though :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:53:35
I think nobody really knows how low it may go. Seems like there are a lot of believers that it will go up again. The question is when.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:42:58
Looks like a great battle at 7k. LMFAO
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:48:28
He's just trolling...
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:00:50
I think is the place to talk about other coins.

11.2k resistance is strong.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:05:16
I guess I'm being downvoted by angry sellers? Lol:)
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:14:02
Let's be realistic and admit than anything can happen in the space. Would you be your actions in this case?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:38:20
SEC hearing seems positive so far and price is going up! Am I delusional? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:43:23
Hodlers! :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:32:01
I think for small amounts it's ok. Does Gemini let you buy with credit card?
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:41:05
Get ready for 12k!!! Lol
