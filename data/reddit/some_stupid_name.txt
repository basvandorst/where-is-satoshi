How cost prohibitive are we talking? A few cents? A few dollars? If the latter, why would you think that things would get that bad? It's pretty clear that the vast majority of interests are for *reasonable* block size increases.

That's a light fluffy straw man you've erected there.

This is a misconception. If you look around, you'll see plenty of debate abound BIP 101 and other scaling proposals. What gets banned are discussions that promote *altcoins*. That covers any software that implements different consensus rules from Bitcoin that are intended lead to a forked blockchain. This subreddit has had a long history of discussion being disrupted by altcoin promoters, and so the no-altcoin rule is a sensible and necessary one.
It seems that people's emotions have distorted this simple rule into "all debate is censored".

Too bad he's wasting his time on a competing project. He could have worked on improving Bitcoin instead. Very disappointing. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:17:43
Whatever. Competing currencies harm Bitcoin. This is war. The only people who try to pretend that competing currencies help bitcoin or the cause of cryptocurrency have placed their bets on altcoins.

In this context he's a competitor.

My cost basis is far lower than the current price. Anyway, my point is that there's a great big world out there and life is short. You don't have to waste it by shitting on other people's hobbies. But if you insist on doing that, why not attack instead, they're probably easier targets. They'll never see you coming!

Yep, he put a very exaggerated and pessimistic spin on issues that have been discussed here at length and on which there are a spectrum of valid positions. Very disingenuous of him, especially in light of who he works for.

We need a new term for "blockchain technology", because clearly people aren't getting the difference between what the banks are trying to do and what a real cryptocurrency is. 
Let's call it what they are: Shared Databases.
They happen to use blockchains for the change log. That's it. Maybe this is better than their old way of doing things, but it has nothing to do with peer to peer cash.
Now that we've gotten that straight, can we please stop posting these articles? Or should we post articles about every financial project that shares tech with cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:32:13
Bitcoin is about being a decentralized bearer asset first, the high-speed transaction thing comes later as a second protocol layer.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:16:57
Network effect and chain security. Bitcoin is king of the hill for both of those. And your argument has been made since the first altcoin was created. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:29:23
The problem is that many comments are so misinformed that they aren't even wrong! 
People shouldn't be posting confident statements about how Bitcoin works unless they know what they're actually talking about. Bitcoin is a deeply technical subject, yet people have no problem making false statements based on an obviously ignorant understanding. 
A good example is when someone claims that in a two-chain situation, a Bitcoin node resolves the contention by selecting the longest one, even if the chains are consensus incompatible. Those comments deserve downvotes.

The other thing that makes BU hostile is that its promoters, Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, are preventing SegWit from activating even though it provides an immediate capacity increase. Instead they spread lies by claiming that BU is the safer alternative.

It's only nearing the limit for spammers.

Yes I think everybody knows that. The BU people are advocating making it worse by giving the tiny mining minority control over the blocksize!

This is a misconception. What you're referring to is a hardfork of *valid* chains - that is, chains that follow the consensus rules. If two valid chains disagree on the ordering of transactions, then the fork with the most work is selected.
In the Core/BU case, BU is proposing to create a chain that contains blocks larger than 1MB. That chain will be *incompatible* with the current chain. In other words, that chain with be an altcoin. Bitcoin was certainly **not** designed with that in mind.
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:45:33

Well Hearn couldn't resist stirring up the hornet's nest. That's really frustrating.

It will be different from ETH/ETC, because in this case the economic majority is clearly on the side of preserving the original chain. For Ethereum fork, the economic majority had decided in favor of the new fork.

That something so anti-Bitcoin as Emergent Consensus can come this far is frightening, and makes me wonder if cryptocurrencies have a future at all.

I know that I'll sound like an asshole for asking this (I've actually asked before), but I'm genuinely curious.
How does Shapeshift get around AML/KYC regulations? Is it registered with FINMA? Is it licensed to operate as a currency exchange in Switzerland?
According to [this document]( Shapeshift would qualify as a financial intermediary (probably under one of these definitions):




This places Shapeshift under a "duty of due diligence" to identify its customers. 


Since Shapeshift does not identify its customers, does it operate under some kind of exception?

And to add to that - he's owned by Roger Ver's goons, visiting us from the conspiracy nuthouse called And Core is actually a collective of 100+ developers contributing to an opensource project similar to the way Linux is developed. 
Blockstream is a company formed by a small subset long-time Core developers as a way to stay focussed full-time on development, and it includes a charter that gives each developer political independence.

There **will** be two Bitcoins after. The rational path foward is for the miners to signal for SegWit to solve the scaling problem right now, and **then** the community will rally behind a 2MB hard fork.

There's very little censorship in this forum. If you try to **promote** a consensus-breaking client (an *altcoin*), that will get deleted. If that didn't happen, this place would be overrun with people pushing altcoins. Other than than, standard moderation practices apply. 
on the other hand, is a place where you'll be effectively censored by the massive downvoting given to anyone who disagrees with Roger Ver's talking points.

Well. Good thing Bitcoin isn't stagnating.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:03:35
There would be two chains both claiming to be Bitcoin. The value of both will drop. It'll be a 1 or 2 year shit show. But I agree it's probably for the best if it lets the two sides do their own thing.

Everyone is dancing around the real reason why altcoins are O/T: they're competition. We all know this, but pretend it's for other reasons. 
used to tolerate altcoin discussion all the time. Namecoin and Litecoin were discussed regularly here in the early days. That's because Bitcoin wasn't worth anything so it was all still a big friendly party.
Dogecoin can pretend to not care about competition because it isn't worth very much. But if the Dogecoin marketcap went up to $1B, they damn well would start to censor other coins promoting themselves in their sub.
So let's not pretend that there aren't good reasons for banning altcoins. This is a fight, and if you're here to promote your side of things, you're gonna have a bad time.

*Everyone* agrees that the cap must be raised. The question is by how much, and at what rate. The parameters must chosen based on careful analysis, and not by taking the most popular values shouted by a crowd.

Agreed, the Ethereum developers are taking quite a big legal risk by pushing for a hard fork for the purpose of seizing and redistributing those stolen DAO coins. They're painting huge targets on their backs.
@_date: 2016-07-04 08:06:42
So why don't they? Let me answer that: because Litecoin's network effect is tiny compared with Bitcoin's. And while it is easy to copy a codebase, it is extremely difficult to copy a network effect.
