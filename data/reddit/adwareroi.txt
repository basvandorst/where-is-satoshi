Allow me to speculate here. If the trends of increasingly desperate governments to take(tax) more and more things, this will create an inefficiency (read opportunity for bitcoin). This exact trend will fuel more reasonable people to try to save their capital. You have to realize that looking at a historical view, when your wealth is evaporating your standard of living will keep going lower. Imagine this yourself. Your business is struggling with a weak economy so you're already working really hard to make any money, then on top of that you have more work and energy trying to actually keep your money. This is positive for a cipherspace economy.

After reading some responses, I actually agree also. If you are betting bitcoins "price" will still keep up with or beat fiat then why not keep it in btc. Its an exciting economic test actually of a new 5 year old currency. I think people who have a lot of money are going to keep nibbling on it to test the waters and then there will be a turning of the tide so to speak.

Is there any url that we can use to demo it on testnet?

I second this. After studying gold and its monetary history, you can see bitcoin really is gold 2.0 but without experience.

This... This happened to me with a gym I really liked. I was on a monthly recurring plan and could cancel anytime, but canceling could not be done over the phone, email, or online. I had to either drive to the gym and do it in person or send a certified letter. Took weeks of this because I just hated the process and was screaming the whole time about it to corporate.

ughhhhh... its causing me a numbing headache watching these noobs. You said it right barfor about them being noobs. As more and more news coverage comes out with these "commentators" discussing it, you can see a pattern of surface level understanding of it.

So what happens when someone makes a hardware wallet, or better consumer oriented wallet software?

"And since exchanges need detailed personal information about a bitcoin user in order to comply with money-laundering laws before issuing a new user with a wallet, the government or other interested parties could determine what any one particular person has been doing in the bitcoin marketplace. "
Another noob trying to figure out bitcoin... I know about this guy with silver articles a while back. The user does not need an exchange to create a wallet lol...
