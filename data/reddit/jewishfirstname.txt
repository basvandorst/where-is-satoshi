Meanwhile, fiat users not affected.

seems like the biggest reason bitcoin is popular is because people dont like banks. Not because it really fills a need. 
but the thing is, with like 2.5% inflation, and my debit cards, I dont need bitcoin. It doesnt really fill a unpractical payment hole. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 11:49:19
this is beyond retarded
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:27:31
yeah so instead lets use some impractical crypto currency that doesn't really have a upside to regular fiat. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:35:44
yeah  but something is only good store of value if it has some serious intrinsic value. Everyone is holding now because they think it will be adopted, these graphs show serious lack of adoption despite massive media attention. 
So once people figure it out, and 2 years from now this graph is still almost flat, mass selling will occur, and price will collapse to like 5 or 10$. So technically these people are speculating it will be used in the future, because it is a terrible store of value right now.

yeah and they were mostly insured and got everything back.
Your move.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:09:20
please specify where it would be higher.
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:33:39
yeah so it doubled? 100%. Vs like 20000% adoption or something ridicilous like that. Part of that is also arbitrage and trading. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:16:46
oh and if you will
Without popular adresses, barely doubled with massive media attention and merchant adoption. This one should be up at least 3-4x by now if people really liked it as a way of payment.

litecoin has a 700 freaking million $ market cap lol. It has basicly zero use lol.

Professor John Quiggin of the University of Queensland has noted that since Bitcoin by design has no intrinsic value, it is "perhaps the finest example of a pure bubble" currently known, but cautions that we have no way to predict when the value of bitcoins will return to zero.[95] Economist Steve Hanke has also mentioned the possibility of a Bitcoin bubble.[96]
Imagine if they are your professor(s). And then you have to take them seriously lol. They cant even inform themselves properly before giving their opinion on something.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:13:01
might as well keep it in cash then
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:26:13
lol and probably more people posted in this reddit, then will actually use bitcoin for take away
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:49:18
seems like a pretty good argument for investing in it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:34:51
why cant i go into redpill? What is so special about it? I kinda want to get in now.

for people not understanding the crypto currency fundamentals, it is built on transactions and practical use in general. We basicly don't need alt coins if we have bitcoin, so they are almost completly useless. The fact that litecoin has a 700 million$ valuation is absolutely ridicilous, as it provides almost zero actual value.
Not saying bitcoin is useless, but you could probably safely say that it is more fairly valued at like 50-60$.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:56:06
Why give a 15% discount? Just because of the novelty effect?
Love your work btw.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:53:25
yeah but everyone has a bank account or credit card already. By your logic you would have to do what you all described, AND set an exchange accoutn up and validated it with your bank account. AND wait for the money to be in.
And then there is the problem of shady exchanges, exchanges charging like 3% for a deposit like bitcoin-e. Exchanges waiting forever to pay out (mtgox) and the risk your bank will give you shit for getting money on the exchange. So picking an exchange randomly is like walking in a mine field of headaches. 
So you need to do research first which exchange is best. And for what?? Most people don't need to send money to the other side of the planet quickly. And usually waiting one day for a bank transfer is more then enough. The fact that so few people use it as a payment method should say enough. I own some bitcoins and still use my credit card and bank card for everything lol. Unless I want to exchange 50k$ to euro's, bitcoin doesn't really give me much value. ANd even then, I get a bank account somewhere who don't rip me off that charge me like 1%. With bitcoin I would pay close to that % as well. 
It pretty much has some use for money remmittance and black markets. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:59:04
yeah the fact that the US military make people want to accept it is ridicilous. We just agreed it would be more practical to use USD. It is protected by the us government in that we can assume there will be no hyper inflation. And that counterfeiting it is really hard. But saying it is backed by the military is a bit ridicilous. It is used untill something better comes alongl, and its value is based on how practical it is. Not on some police state principal.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:33:08
lol this shows how bullish everyone is, that clearly negative news is being perceived as positive. It is BANNED as a currency people, that is really really bad.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:08:45
it was easier with bitcoin tho
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:22:56
seems like they chose an appropriate name for their website.

egold was taken down because of money laundering. Bitcoin is set up differently. It is technically not illegal. Unless an exchange allows anonymous buying of bitcoin then there is no risk here. Also I dont think you can sue bitcoin for allowing the sale of kiddie porn. Since it technically doesnt carry responsibility. Just like you cannot sue cash. You would have to make bitcoin illegal, and on what ground? If this becomes big, then there is big money behind defending this. Especially  if this becomes popular by the public.
Regarding liberty dollars, there was counterfeit risk there I think. Again an easy target because it is centralized and you can put responsibility on a certain group. People were confusing it with regular dollars I think. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:00:37
514 billion is not multimillion dollar coin. It would be more like 25k$ per coin. Still a very nice return tho.
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:39:16
what happens to the price when alot of people are buying bitcoins and then selling the same amount for a different currency within a few hours? Does it pretty much stay the same, since buying is offset by a similar amount of selling?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:35:43
isnt the up and down vote thing designed to stop this?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:37:34
This is actually pretty easy to take down. But I don't think they can get away with it legally. Since it is basicly another decentralized currency. On what grounds would they make it illegal? Isn't that unconstitutional. And how on earth do you acctually get bitcoins if they do manage to do so?
I mean you have to do it by using cash, seems like a major hassle, and probably makes the markets too illiquid. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:37:05
peter shiff's brain has no intrinsic value
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:39:01
isnt it way more. If credit cards cost like 3%, and bitpay 1% (right?) then it should be more like 200 million.

You dont, you simply send it to their bank account. Or you pay in person in cash. You put a buy order out there with location or contact info. You could give your exact adress, or just general area. If the network is big enough you might find out that your neighbour wants to buy for example. In time you could establish trusted adresses, maybe let the software take a year or 6 months before that happens. And as soon as one scam happens then they are no longer considered trusted. this way scamming would take way too much effort for too little reward. When you have alot of trusted adresses then you can just send by bank. You could also match up banks to make it even faster and more efficient.
 It works a bit like bitcoin.de but uses decentralized p2p software instead.
