I know a pattern when I see one. Easier to fool people than convince them they've been fooled. Keep holding those bags, the house always wins

Ver playing his childish games again today
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:02:07
He started his games again yesterday pumping bcsh 30% before he went on Alex Jones (which backfired). It looks like he is suppressing the btc price since yesterday too with big sell walls on Bitfinex to make it appear bcsh is 'winning' for marketing purposes. It's all fake and lies as usual, he's a lonely boy obsessed with money and power but nobody takes him seriously.

Well played Ver / Armstrong / Bitfinex

All the red from smart money selling: Charlie Lee, Winkelvii, Andreas A etc etc

We've been duped. From 'just hodl' Charlie Lee who sold right around at ATH, to gdax performing maintenance just before the crash. Tether and bca$$h playing with their pawns. The game is rigged and those in the know jumped ship before the shit hit the fan. Even Dimon knew it was a fraud, those annoying fud bubble graphs and Warren Buffet warnings were also spot on. Bitconnect timed their exit scam perfectly didn't they. McAfee has your money and won't be eating his dick, sorry.

Hodl the bags

And you believe him?
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:36:39
Look at the timing of the bcsh pump and when the huge sell walls on btc appeared, almost simultaneously. You would be naive to think there is no connection.

Ver back with his sell walls, what a douche
