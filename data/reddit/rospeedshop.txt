y'all deserve to be drained, I don't care if he was banned because of his attitude or whatever, that exploit could have left you bare naked, 25k for such a exploit is nothing compared to what he could have withdrew with the exploit.

" but ppl can choose to use it or not of their own free will." 
true, that's why the people from bitcoin.org chose to remove that shit.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:02:45
it doesn't matter how big the company is, if it can't hold on to the core of what bitcoin is about then you don't deserve a spot in the list. Simple as fucking that. This ain't a pijamas party, either you in fully or fucking out.

increase yes, but NO bip101
 I see you like to rot your brains to long worded sentences, so here's one for you: basically I am for block size increases obviously that is beneficial, BUT agains bip101 due to it's fucking centrelasied nature.

after the 2nd exploit you should have left them bankrupt.

bitcoin blood = decentralised
coinbase = centralised
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:35:12
coinbase is a unethical service, fucking hypocrites.

It's not, you compare a well respected bussiness man with a crooked liar. Don't want to dive too deep into politics here, but in this case it is not the case of 2 pies same filling, this is hilary lying her nasty teeth out:
Compare this lying bitch with donald:
Now from my point of view both are not that good of a presidents, but between two I would always choose the bussiness man that didn't change his opinions and mindset for the entirety of his life as opposed a lying crooked cunt that changes her opinion in months time depending on how fat the donation check is from the arab prince. Donald was alyways against going into iraq,  has another big + in my book: his arrogance of being the best and never lose will give him the motivation to be the best president in the eyes of the americans and one more thing: polls don't lie, he will be the next president and I am happy about that, he looks like a good succesor to JFK, he will do all the more better in america than that bitch will ever do(she will never do anything good, deleting 30k emails full of sensitive emails, so many incriminating emails leaked, crimes after crimes, fiscal evasion, bribing, Benghazi, lybia, and so many more)

I'm not talking about 3rd world countries, I am talking about the individual who has 2-3 btc and deems a trezor expensive. Of course poor countries are not in this discussion, you really need to check yoself.
@_date: 2016-02-27 05:16:42
if you are serious about the security of your money no, it's not expensive.

This is nothing compared with Romania, we can buy bitcoin from any supermarket, we got 2 robocoin atms and plenty other, our own exchange, thousands of terminals, big stores accepting bitcoin. We own this bitch.

Everything makes sense if we don't care who made bitcoin and keep it anonymous, if I read through here correctly that's what he wanted, he wouldn't come out now as a aussie or somebody else.
EDIT: I am guessing those who downvote have such boring lifes they love cheap dramas born out of nothing.
