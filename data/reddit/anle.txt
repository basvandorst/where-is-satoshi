It's more that Aubrey is solving the problem of western nations not having kinds anymore and getting super old (This Kurzgesagt's video explains it well  Also *not dying* is not going to contribute as much as having more or less children to overpopulation since *not dying* contributes only linearly. 
The carrying capacity of the planet will also improve very much in the future, we should be optimistic about this.
* Resources: Agriculture is only getting better. The management of space with vertical farms, as well as the productivity of crops, even in very severe environments (near desert conditions for instance).
* Available housing: We have already done decently well at making buildings, though by no means have we meet the limitations of our building capacities in the sky (and especially in the ground).
* Carbon footprint: Climate change is an issue being tackled by many. It is an important topic that is being solved as we speak, everything from electric cars like Tesla, to a much higher efficiency for solar power and a lower price tag.
Here is an important thought I'll leave you with. What if humanity does manage to handle overpopulation in the future? If we did not have these anti aging therapies present, humanity at that time would be destined to an unnecessary death. Hence we have a moral obligation to create these therapies so that humanity of the future has the choice of using it or not.

This video is probably worth watching. Aubrey de Grey explains what SENS is all about: 
Also the video Kurzgesagt made about ending aging mentions two of the therapies Aubrey talks about in his book Ending Aging:

Yeah I agree with you. It's nice we are on the same page. 
Issues must be addressed, not feared :)

I strongly suggest to read Aubrey's book Ending Aging about what SENS is about. Even if it was published in 2007, the strategy described in it is much stronger now in terms of evidence supporting it and results obtained. Some therapies (as senescent cells removal) are going into human clinical trials (see Unity Biotechnology) and the basic research made at SENS is going far enough that companies are spawning out of it (since they see that there is commercial application). But in order to accelerate the basic research the funding needed is something like 40M per year instead of just 4M per year, as basic research is the engine that moves it all and for now the pace is limited by funding and not by the difficulty of the science.

The AMA started:

You don't understand that if SENS or other similar orgs are too slow, nor boomers nor millennials are going to benefit from the first therapies addressing the root causes of aging. 
Reasoning using categories as "boomers" or "millennials" is not helpful. All people are different and the best people in any generation contribute to the advancements of technology and society. You should thank boomers for the Internet and a lot of other amazing technologies (or at least you should thank the best of the boomers). As you should thank all the people in the generations before them who helped to accelerate the progress of humanity to this point. 
I'm 22 years old and I prefer to fix problems instead of holding grudges against vague groups of people. This is how I want to contribute to society. The next generations are going to thank me, as I'm thankful to many people in the generations before me.

Futurism (a blog with millions of readers - Its Facebook page has 6.2 millions likes:  talks about the recent Aubrey de Grey's AMA and the funding problem that plagues his field of research and SENS specifically:  
Quote from the article, that quotes an answer in the AMA:
At this point, nothing is stopping de Grey and his foundation from accomplishing their goals, save for the lack of money, he said. “We have the plan and we have the people,” de Grey wrote. “It’s all about enabling those people, giving them the resources to get on with the job.”

Btw the Chief Science Officer of SENS Aubrey de Grey is doing an AMA on r/futurology today. So if OP has any questions can ask him directly.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:03:43
We can *work* on both. It's not like we are a monomaniac species thinking only about one task at a time. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:43:31
100k people out of 150k total are dying of aging every day. Curing aging is *obviously* going to save more lives (not to mention QALYs) than fighting net neutrality. And yes, we can do both anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:50:49
Not curing them has the same effect of killing them. Also the therapies are going to benefit all the generations coming after baby boomers.

@_date: 2017-12-04 15:17:19
Ok let's kill them all. Totally reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:03:12
100k people per day die of old age. In order to make the speed of this kind of research be limited only by the difficulty of the science SENS needs a budget of 40M per year instead of just 4M. This would accelerate things by more or less10 years. If you do the math it turns out that you can save a life with just 2$. SENS is far more cost effective than any other organization out there. The other most effective orgs save a life with thousands of dollars. But this is obvious if you think about the fact that aging is responsible of 2/3 of all deaths and the majority of QALYs lost.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:12:20
Aging is the most important problem in the world and we should support who wants to put it under control with serious science. SENS is the way!!

This PDF is from 2006 lol. This is part of a contest organized by MIT that consisted in submitting tries to refute SENS, judged by an impartial jury of experts in biotech and a prize in many thousands dollars for the winner. No one won the contest. Some scientists who tried to refute SENS back then now work with SENS.
Here all the organisations SENS made research with: 
Here you can find all the papers published by SENS:  there are some very important ones, as the one explaining the total synthesis of glucosepane obtained for the first time, or the one about two mitochondrial proteins expressed in the nucleus.
