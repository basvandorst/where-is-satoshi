How long?  I started in 2009.  At one point, I was 0.5% of global hashpower.  And none of those people had anything to do with me believing that btc is currently fundamentally broken.  That is why I hedge my bets with bch.  $60/KB is not a reasonable price for fees.  And that is down from $150 a couple weeks ago.  Bch fees are currently $0.07/KB with average blocksize right near 1 MB.  When there are more than 1 MB of transactions to be confirmed, it includes them for a reasonable price instead of starting a bidding war.  Arbitrary, fixed blocksize is a form of production quota.  When has that ever worked out well?  Learn basic economics and quit trying to find boogiemen to blame.

While there is a correlation, it takes time to purchase, receive, and set up new hardware, so there will be a lag when price rises, which is the only small window of profit for miners already set up.  When prices fall, hardware can come offline almost instantly.  Of course, if price rises again, some of this hardware will be kept ready to be revived, helping to reduce the previously mentioned delay on price rises.

How about the issue of 3-5% transaction fees, monthly merchant account fees, and you still get fucked if you accept a card and the customer asks to have the charge reversed?  With bitcoin, the merchant pays no fees (or a maximum of 1% to convert to USD if they don't want to hold BTC) and at the end of the day you can close out your books without the risk of chargeback.  You have to wait 90 days to know you can keep the CC money, and many businesses have been bankrupted by scammers hitting them with 3 months worth of chargebacks at one time.

Sorry, but I think this is actually a good idea.  Without such restrictions, a businesses market cap could halve overnight.  That's not how you build a stable business.  As long as it is open to reconsideration as Bitcoin stabilizes with larger market cap.  I would be more comfortable if they had a max percent of profit that could be held in BTC.  They could start with 5% now and allow the cap to rise along with the BTC market cap.

Your first reference refers to devaluation of the local currency compared to foreign currencies.  This is not what QE does because other nations QE right along with us.  What the Fed devalues the dollar against is real assets.  Gold, silver, bitcoin, housing, energy, transportation, food, clothing all get more expensive.
In addition to not helping exports, QE inflates all dollar denominated financial markets.  This serves to give money to those who have the extra money to invest.  It is an unproductive circlejerk.
You are correct that foreign demand is what supports to dollar, but this is merely momentum.  We are 4% of the world's population that suck resources from the globe and ship back trash.  Now that I think about it, I'll agree with you it is good we have a strong military, because we deserve to have the shit kicked out of us for allowing this to go on.

Don't worry, bitcoin is a public ledger and in order to operate in the US all exchanges must implement AML/KYC.

Nice link.  Did you read it?  I especially liked the last paragraph:
The conclusion seems obvious to anyone whose mind is not firmly locked into the Keynesian or monetarist framework: The free market works. Even in the face of massive shocks requiring large structural adjustments, the best thing the government can do is cut its own budget and return more resources to the private sector. For its part, the Federal Reserve doesn’t help matters by flooding the shell-shocked credit markets with green pieces of paper. Prices can adjust to clear labor and other markets soon enough, in light of the new fundamentals, if only the politicians and central bankers would get out of the way.

But they can ask you to tell them where you sent it, under threat of legal action/prison.
And, no, they (the government) don't know what happens in your bank account unless it is over a certain limit or they get a subpoena.  If you keep your bitcoin exchanges small enough, they still need a subpoena to request your identity, but the ledger itself is public information.  Unless you know exactly what you are doing and never mix coins, leaking identity is a very easy mistake.

All bitcoin transactions are traceable, but that only tells you what addresses were involved, not who controls those addresses.  It is crypto-currency not in the sense of encryption, but in the sense that cryptographic signatures are used to verify transactions.  As for U.S. companies requiring info, you can thank the government for requiring it.  However, you can likely find someone at localbitcoins.com who will sell to you without being too nosy.  localbitcoins will require the seller to put the coins in escrow, and they will release them to you when you meet them and hand over your cash.

Facial recognition software is quite good.  Pick out a few key points like the corners is the eyes and mouth, cheekbones, tip of nose, etc., scale the points to a normalized size (or if you had control of the camera hardware or had a calibration procedure, you could measure actual size), and look at the distances between various points.  These vectors tend to compare well with a 2 norm and are quite robust to hair and other noise.

If you bought crop insurance, you wouldn't need to hedge:
"Crop insurance is purchased by agricultural producers ... to protect themselves against ... the loss of revenue due to declines in the prices of agricultural commodities."  Even if you have crop insurance and you do hedge, you still have to buy back at a higher price than what the crop insurance will reimburse you.  A shrewd farmer would leave the hedging to the insurance fund.

And exchanges want increased transaction volume.  It benefits them in no way to keep it limited.  If miners signal that they are ready to increase block size, exchanges will follow suit.

Sure, there are altcoins.  But at the present stage of ecosystem development the economic majority is focused on Bitcoin and is primarily writing software to handle that one coin/network.  Maybe your concern would be prescient in a decade when software is designed to handle multiple forms of crypto and the cost to switch is lower.
But, yes, money can flow out of Bitcoin itself and that will always be a concern when introducing any rule change.
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:47:02
Sidechains would be a softfork change.  This means that sidechain blocks are still valid blocks to nonsidechain clients.  This results in the sidechain fork overtaking the nonsidechain fork as soon as it gets majority hashpower without causing the nonsidechain fork to reject its blocks.  Softforks can't really be stopped, but they can only be used to tighten up the rules, not relax them.

Except with a soft fork the blocks produced by the newer version are still valid under the old rules/client. It is a tightening of the rules. There is no other coin/chain to go to because there is no actual forking going on. The old code can produce blocks that don't validate under the new rules, but so long as 51% mine the new rules the new rules will result in the longest chain and the old code will follow the chain with the new rules.
My conclusion follows just fine if you'd take the time to understand the terminology.

The 75% requirement is for 75% of hashpower, not 75% of developers.  Developers can't change anything or stop a change without miner support and miners can't make decisions without considering the community since they need the community to stick with their version so their rewards still have value.

@_date: 2015-08-11 17:11:10
With a softfork as long as 51% mines the new rule, the rule will be consensus.  This is because the new rule is more restrictive so the old clients also see the blocks as valid.  Miners on old code can produce blocks that are no longer valid, but they will be orphaned.
Economic majority matters for hard forks, but not softforks.

Why do transactions need to cost more than it costs miners to process them?
@_date: 2015-07-09 04:32:03
Mostly because inputs are hashes so it is unlikely a given set of inputs will have a unique feature that distinguish them from other transactions in the unspent transaction output list (UTXO).
Also, because transaction size isn't the major problem here.  The problem is UTXO size.

Go for it:
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:15:52
