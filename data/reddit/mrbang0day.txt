Bitcoin is not a company, Blockstream is. Bitcoin is an open source software, and in the repository there is Bitcoin source code, not Blockcstream code.

what software stack are you using? *nix + bitcoind? I want to run a btc server as well! Have some tips for me?

Thank you for the tips! I'm going to build from sources using the master branch from the Github repo. Does it make sense to jail the bitcoin-core server process into a chroot environment or a linux container (maybe Docker)?

Does it need a static ip or behind nat should be ok? So, i have just to download bitcoind core source code, compile it and make it run, right?

I want to do the exactly same thing as well. Could you share with me and the community your configuration? I'm new to "run a bitcoin node" world and i'm collecting as much as possible information in order to setup a nice and working node before the end of June. I've got a vps (Xen, 6 vcpu, 1GB Ram, ~30GB hdd) and I want to help the network.

I've just checked the kernel installed on my own vps and it does not support Docker. Actually i'm focused on building bitcoin from source, wish to do it in the right way. The next step is to think about the deployment.

I really can't believe those things happen in the real world. I've read plenty of bad stories on r/personalfinance about US banks sending money to wrong account, no-notice account closing, account opened in the name of another person without his/her approval, cc card openend using someone social security number etc. USA seems to have a bank system directly from '800, the good old wild west.

they deserve that! Selling malware software to totalitarian regimes means having no ethics!

in a world where official app is scam as the unofficial one, do you really want to use an app/website to manage your money?
