Gox are crooks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:17:48
The second they stopped allowing USD withdrawals last year was the time to get the fuck out.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:11:08
Positive stuff!
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:00:06
I thought the same thing except I couldn't buy back. Every correction that has happened in the last month, I was there at the right time but had no funds anymore. Fucking Dwolla had to bail out.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:31:58
Same. I don't have near as many as I once did.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:53:29
Same here. Held strong what I had and bought more at the bottom. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:20:43
We'll be back to $900 before 11:59 PM EST today.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:28:36
I'm getting "We will be back in 15 minutes."
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:00:34
Dwolla bailed out at the worst time possible for me.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:33:32
China is hitting $1000+ and CampBX/Bitstamp are just sitting at $675
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:39:28
That must be why CampBX has been lagging behind this whole rise. Hopefully volume and price picks up when they start accepting ACH deposits on Wednesday. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:47:02
How long will the hearing be?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:25:06
I know I was just saying. When I read this post it was going down to 800 very fast lol.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:55:20
Fuck yeah. This is why you take a breath and wait before panic selling.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:38:50
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:59:05
At the time they were talking about cyber crime, child pornography, etc. No idea why people decided that "we need to fight crime!" was a reason to panic.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:24:16
Now's the time to buy. We'll be back in the late 700s to 800 in a couple of hours
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:19:11
People need to stop panic selling. Let's at least hit 1000! Jesus lol
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:42:47


That $223 BTCCHINA price increase in the last 12 hours leaves a lot to think about. It's probable that the 12 hour price will go as high as April's bubble ($266), or more.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:19:55
Mostly overracting to what's being talked about in CSPAN 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:42:47
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:08:48
I'm ready to go back to $1000
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:53:04
$600 was the drop. Ride the wave to $1000
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:09:29
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:15:10
Market is panicking LOL. BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:47:15
Cash out using Coinbase. It's the most effective way right now. Make a backup and start selling the maximum daily amount.
 There's also Localbitcoins.
Avoid Mt.Gox... Sure you'd get more money per btc but good luck seeing that money for months.
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:01:46
Aw man I'm so late
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:08:00
Panic selling.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:18:28
The streets will flood in blood in the next 12 hours.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:50:10
Have you looked into CampBX? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:56:51
$1400 in January
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:02:46
Buy buy buy
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:17:55
Perfect time to profit off of panic sellers overreacting to news
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:59:59
They've been trustworthy. Aside from the support tickets taking a while (which from what I've read, is due to the small operation they have going), there's no issues. In two days they'll begin accepting ACH for deposits, if you're interesting about using that. It should attract more members and volume. I have been using them almost exclusively since April and it's been good.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:33:22
Sell now and buy back at the bottom. Your stash will only get bigger.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:50:50
Hold it. Everyone I know has started buying more. Hold strong and be patient
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:10:11
Looks like Bernanke's BTC orders just went through.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:12:29
I think in the next 12 hours we'll be down to ~$450 for sure. Right now it doesn't seem plausible that it'll go anywhere near $600 or $650. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:50:03
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there a isn't there a delay to when the trade is executed? As opposed to CampBX where the trade is instant as long as you have the funds. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:16:59
Well that's disappointing. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:41:37
Positive stuff. Hold strong everyone.
Edit: Hats off to those who held strong, we just hit $713 all time high on GOX.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:11:04
That's how I feel about not selling at the peak last night lol
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:37:42
Wait, so if I complete all steps of verification I can do instant transactions? No waiting 4+ business days?
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:49:52
Buy buy buy
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:48:56
Starting 11/20, CampBX will accept ACH... $2 + 0.055% per deposit.
