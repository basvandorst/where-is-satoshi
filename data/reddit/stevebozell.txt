Also in 2009, OneWest had the locks changed on the home of a Minneapolis woman in the middle of a blizzard, even after the company sent her a letter stating, 'You expressed concern that at the end of the redemption period … you and your mother will be evicted from the property. … Rest assured, that will not take place due to the rescission of the foreclosure sale.'

"Your comments are off-topic..."
I'm not the one who invoked religion. That was off topic.
" Freedom of religion is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance."
I support that partially. The US Constitution separates Church and State, so there are limitations. It also does not support discrimination, so there are bounds on how far the religious can go in certain situations. There are also laws which set societal norms, so that e.g. Muslims in the USA do not have the right to cut off the clitoris of women.
"Respect that please." 
Never. I retain the principle that respect should be reserved for things worthy of respect. Bronze Age superstitious and magical beliefs are not worthy of respect and retard the progress of society. Religion does not get a free pass to be respected.
"... do not mock other people's believe."
This is a public forum.
I support fully that person's right to harbor superstitious beliefs (so long as they are not used to break laws or injure others).
I also have the right to mock such childish nonsense, and believe that religion deserves to be mocked and ridiculed.

"I'm not condemning his decisions, but making a note of what he should have done.."
As I've already noted, you have no idea if you are correct that he did not notify the bank, and there is no reason to believe  that this is his bank and not the exchange causing the problem.
And if it should turn out to be an issue with his bank, you have no idea if advance notification is the issue.
But obviously facts and evidence are meaningless for you, as it's easier to make value judgement based on lack of knowledge.

Thanks for the response.
I'd like to see a Median Daily Price for 2014 in USD for BTC.
Is there a way to do that - choose a specific day and see the median price at Coinbase/GDAX or if not Bitstamp or if not anywhere with a general market line (not outlier prices).
I can create a chart on this site but there's no daily stated price and it's not awfully specific as far as an exact median price (or close price or whatever).
Thank you.

"We have not been censoring - we are removing old posts..."
Removing old posts is censoring.
There is currently not one post on r/KrakenSupport.
Instead you are asking Redditors to use a form.
It would be just as easy to let people continue to post and contact them via the info in the posts.
The advantage to Redditors is it keeps us informed as to the depth and severity of the issues many Kraken customers have.
"I'm sorry to hear that you've had a bad experience. Has your deposit been located yet?"
The statements about deposits not located are from others - I should have put quotes around the statements.
I'll reorganize that so it is clear.
I'm aggregating and posting the Kraken comments so that others can be aware of possible issues they will have if they use Kraken.
Thank you for your concern about my experience - unfortunately I've been afraid to use my Kraken account due to the frequent recurring problems many seem to have.

"I have been waiting 12 days for verification support ticket to be sorted out. Verifications should be required before depositing not when you are needing to withdraw."
I see that you got verified so hopefully you are ok, but it appears that they are accepting deposits without notifying that verification is needed for withdrawal, then not verifying and locking funds.

Wrong, that is not at all what is happening here.
As the OP has alluded to, the US Gov does not demand the records of every citizen who has moved 20k in or out of their bank account during a given year.
As Coinbase and others have stated, this is a fishing expedition.
If they have reason to request an individual's records they can audit him and he'll have to produce documents. They have always had this option.
Government intrusion always expands, never contracts. 
This is just the beginning.

I agree with some of your post, but "I'm playing with house money now" is foolishness.
What if "the house's money" is hacked from your account?
Are you going to say, "Well, I really don't care because it was never my money, it was the house's"?
What if you cash out from a casino, deposit into the casino cage your original buy in, and walk out with "the house's money".
You get home, and someone is waiting for you (as has happened on occasion to casino customers) with a gun and takes "the house's money".
Do you call the police, or do you not bother because it wasn't your money?
It is your money. You are holding btc and they are YOUR BTC, not the house's BTC.
Was your investing goal to break even? And after that the profit is irrelevant?
"The house money" is what the time and risk and effort went into.

Yet you are upset that knowledgeable experienced posters - the ones that a noob could use as a valuable resource to get up to speed - are imparting knowledge and valuable information.

Coinbase should definitely have this info displayed in all caps before accepting Canadians, or have a popup giving this info.
There have been numerous posts with the same Coinbase issue.
It's misleading for them not to state this clearly as soon as a Canadian enters their country name.
Just one more failure of Coinbase - and this one is easily remedied. But then they'd miss out on the transaction fees.

I find your post to be exactly what you are criticizing others for - negative and ignorant.

The term "money laundering" has lost all meaning.

Likewise for the categories: Withdrawals/Buys/Sells.
The IRS will end up gaining a lot of tax $$$ from this venture, and thus will very likely widen the parameters based on their results and the court will very likely comply.

"It's personal".
You don't owe anyone confidential information that does not affect their well being in any way.
Or ask him - "You go first. How much is in your bank accounts, how much debt do you have, what is your salary?"
Does your close friend owe you the same info he's asking of you?
"...they aren't being nosey, they just generally care."
What aspect of care involves being definitely nosy and intrusive inquiring into your personal financial resources?

Agree - depending on circumstances.
If one is young and has a job (which will hopefully be there for years to come) where one can replace the funds eventually and not have a miserable life meanwhile, then conditions make it more reasonable to go for it.
If one is older and nearer the end of a working lifespan, and it will be difficult to recover from taking a plunge, then it can affect the remainder of one's life in an unpleasant way that probably isn't worth it.
What if one finds a casino error/promotion that has a gigantic advantage - e.g., 50%.
There are not many times in life where one will find a similar advantage, if ever.
Simply blindly saying "Don't invest more than you are willing to lose" is free advice and in general only worth what you paid for that advice.

One sees "mental accounting" frequently in gambling.
Someone will lose 1k during a poker session, then win a $900 pot and feel great and cash out a $100 loser.
The same person will be ahead 1k, then go on a downswing and end up down $100 before cashing out, and feel miserable.

Gemini - which I've read has Segwit - has this notice on their website currently:
"BTC deposits and withdrawals are temporarily unavailable due to an extreme delay in block mining on the Bitcoin Network. Your full BTC balance is still securely being stored in Gemini's offline storage systems. We anticipate the network to recover to full health within the next few hours."
This is not a knock on Gemini imo - they are being transparent and I assume don't want to get hundreds of "Where is my BTC transfer?" tickets today.
So yes, lets do whatever can be done to get Segwit initiated everywhere.
Coinbase alone would help greatly.

" We have not been censoring FALSE. You are positively censoring r/krakensupport:

You have effectively cut out all posts on that site (other than ones you permit which so far amount to...Zero).
I'll take a wild guess: if the majority of posts had been "Thank you Kraken, you are great!" you would not be "filtering" and would not have disabled comments to the one post that is there.

I've seen Ver on other long interviews such as with Richard Heart and with Ton Vayz.
He is always polite, waits his turn to speak without interrupting, is soft spoken, and never behaves like this.
I watched this interview but stopped before he got mad because I was getting mad.
The interviewer attacked him non-stop, continually interrupted him as he was making a point, changed the subject every time Ver was responding with a correction to the interviewer's question, etc.
He was polite enough to tell the interviewer that he would like to continue making his point, and that if the interview runs over the allotted time he would be glad to return and continue it.
I would have walked out long before Ver (justifiably) exploded.
It's unfair and manipulative to just show the last 2 minutes rather than at least offer people the chance to show the interview from the beginning so they can see what led up to this ending.

I didn't see "I'd be surprised if you have much BTC" as an insult. 
But it is an inaccurate read of you based on the info in your response.
And as stated, I am surprised.
"At least in the US, I find this idea that the only thing that can keep a rich person safe is anonymity, ridiculous."
The OP wrote "Dont tell people how much BTC you have."
That's a lot different (to me) from living in "anonymity".
I don't see the point of telling people I have BTC unless I'm telling them about BTC in general and then they ask,  but even then I say I have "a little" or something like that.
I don't see an upside to being very open about it. But I don't see that as living in anonymity.

Bookies don't normally set the market price.
They offer opening prices, usually for low limits, and the bettors set the market price after that.
But in the case of these propositions, the odds are ripoffs for the bettor, and I'm sure the limits are very low \- possibly about $50 USD, and can probably only be bet once.
The bookies in effect are favoring the other side of each of these bets.

Lots of naivity in this thread.
Because it hasn't happened to you or it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean its not in the works \- and it is \- or at least was as of 5 months ago:
"**Forfeit Your Bitcoin? Congressional Bill Draws Fire Over Border Check Rules**
**A group of US lawmakers wants to see cryptocurrency holdings declared at the nation's border** – and advocates of the tech are pushing back.
Introduced last month, the Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 – which is actually the third iteration of a bill that debuted in 2011 – would bring a range of digital currency services under federal scrutiny, including those that provide transaction mixing services.
Yet, **the provision that has attracted the particular ire of cryptocurrency advocates – especially those who prefer a regulation\-light environment – is one that would make such holdings subject to disclosure requirements at US customs checkpoints. This means if a person trying to enter the country has more than $10,000 worth of bitcoin in their possession, under the proposed legal change, they would need to inform the relevant authorities."**
So it's very likely that something like this is in the works or that this bill is still live, and that some over zealous authoritarians at the borders are hassling people over this.
Many LEOs have a poor understanding of the law and overstep their bounds.
Glad to hear no one yet responding has had any incident yet.
This following one is comical to anyone with the most basic knowledge of BTC, but here is the level one is commonly dealing with:
Going back over 3 years ago, the TSA thought they saw bitcoins in someone's airport baggage and wanted to count it to make sure he wasn't carrying over 10k without declaring it.

I spent an insane amount of time calculating my taxes for the last 4 years and the estimate for this year.

Not a fault of BTC but of the IRS, and of software accounting systems which do not apply to many situations.
If BTC transactions under $600 were not subject to USA taxes, as was proposed for a Congressional bill, this would help the situation a great deal.

"This compliance step doesn't have anything to do with Coinbase caring to know about anything you do; its regulators and bank are demanding the additional information."
Then let them state this upfront. State what the rules and regulations are, and what personal intrusive info they will be demanding.

So I do blame Conbase, for not stating that they've changed the personal info that they will insist on.

I believe so. 
Thus far every exchange and service I've tried that lists Google Authenticator works with Authy with no problems and easy setup.
Authy has excellent email cs - you could ask them.
After they respond, they will follow up a few days later asking if the issue has been resolved or do you have further questions.
Quite a wonderful change from all the slow to non-existent email cs out there.
Also could ask each site. I know that every exchange (8) I've checked with that lists GA accepts Authy and it is working fine with all of them.

Agree completely. Just went thru that today for Tier 3.
Had to get someone to take my picture holding license in one hand and handwritten note in other with signature and date.
But it gets worse. 
My phone takes pictures of about 600 MG size.
Their limit is 300 MG. So after going thru all that their system won't accept my pix.
 I then had to email them and it can take 48 hours for a response (as stated - in my experience with these companies which offer minimal and slow support it takes longer).
By contrast I registered with Gemini today.

"By inserting individual arbitration clauses into a soaring number of consumer and employment contracts, companies like American Express devised a way to circumvent the courts and bar people from joining together in class-action lawsuits, realistically the only tool citizens have to fight illegal or deceitful business practices.
Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to apply for a credit card, use a cellphone, get cable or Internet service, or shop online without agreeing to private arbitration. The same applies to getting a job, renting a car or placing a relative in a nursing home."

If you lose the phone or it becomes non-functional, you have a major hassle.
If you are going to change phones and the phone with the Authenticator is still working, go to each site and cancel 2FA.
Change phones, setup again.
Or - use Authy, which is not a privacy invader like anything Google. 
Turn off "Allow multi-device".
Allow "Backups". These will be on their storage.
Also as porksandwich9113 says below, copy the "secret key" when you set up each account.
Or if you aren't about to get a new phone and determined to keep GA, do what he suggests:
"...head... back into the settings on each of your apps, disabling 2FA and redoing the setup."

"Gwyneth Paltrow Wants You To Put This Egg In Your Vagina
Don’t. Please don’t."
"But despite the fact that you can’t buy one of the eggs right now ― they’re currently sold out on both Goop and Rose’s website ― you also just shouldn’t. Doctors were quick to say women really shouldn’t use jade eggs, just as they were quick to speak out when Paltrow bizarrely recommended vaginal steaming."
“ 'The vagina and the rest of our reproductive organs are actually quite smart at regulating themselves and need no interference from douches, jade eggs or Gwyneth Paltrow,' [Dr. Rodriguez] said. 'If something has changed with your vulva and vagina, and you are having symptoms, see your doctor, not the internet.' "
Gwyneth Paltrow's company's website:
"Better Sex: Jade Eggs for Your Yoni
From Kegels and the Elvie to vaginal steaming and even laser treatments, we’re not shy here at goop about our interest in keeping our sexual/reproductive systems in optimal health. So when beauty guru/healer/inspiration/friend Shiva Rose started talking about jade eggs, we wanted to hear more."

Rejected at Gemini.
They asked for license and a bill with residential address, which I provided.
Took them 6 days and an email from me before responding, asking for a pay stub.
I told them that I don't have any, and got a response of "I will look into other ways to verify you, however at this point I do not have another option to offer". 
This sounded like I'd be hearing back.
Sent 2 emails, finally got this back after 4 more days:
"I do not have any other options to offer."

Haven't heard back from either exchange yet (Kraken/Gemini).
It's amazing that people who want to build a credible financial business which people will have confidence in consistently cut corners on cs, to the point that it barely exists.
Does anyone reading this have a bank and/or credit card which does not have 24/7 telephone support?
Kraken admits it can take 48 hours for a response. This is acceptable for 2 eight year olds running a lemonade stand. Perhaps. But probably even that 48 hour response time is optimistic (e.g., see SerhaTR16's post).
I'm only at the start of the process even after they respond.
My living situation is that I do not pay utilities - none are in my name. And my mailing address, which I use for everything, is different from my residence address.
I just got approved within the last month for 2 high end credit cards and an online bank account
despite this, with no real hassles.
But I know the idiots in the "Security" departments of these exchanges will probably require me to make a video of unlocking the door to my residence and giving them a room to room tour, 2 fingerprint cards and a urine sample.

"Right now there's no problem leaving the US." 
I had formerly thought that, and had planned to do what you describe in your first 4 sentences.
But alas...
"The TSA is looking for Bitcoin"
February 24th, 2014   Submitted by Davi Barker
The article above and the video linked below are from 3.5 years ago. 
They saw what they thought were physical bitcoins in his bag, and he was told that if he's flying internationally then it could be an issue if he is carrying more than 10k.
In this case he was flying domestically, but that's irrelevant to the issue of TSA/cops making an issue in the future of seeing a Bitcoin wallet.
As we all know, between 3.5 years ago and now the word "Bitcoin" is much more widely known by the masses.
And some reps of the USA Gov have very recently been making statements about aggressively going after those using bitcoins for nefarious means.
So If a TSA agent spots a BTC Hardware WALLET and he is knowledgeable - and eventually they will be trained to look for it - it will - if not now, in the coming years - be a problem.
One thing that needs to be done is the industry needs to adopt a new word instead of "wallet", as that is playing into their (often dim-witted) hands.
I propose "Bitbook". 
And our argument is - It's like carrying a bankbook or a checkbook thru Customs.
"Wallet" is a big red flag.

Everyone should be aware that having one's bank account closed (almost) always leads to one's credit card(s) with that bank being closed, although that may take a month or two.
So if one's bank account is closed and one has a credit card with the same bank, spend or transfer your points ASAP to be safe. 
And start using another credit card rather than building up more points on that bank's card.

If only someone would invent email, so Poloniex could have directly contacted each user, not just those who visit the site and/or follow everyone of their daily Tweets on Twitter.

Now I use a hardware wallet. It's worth the investment and one has no fear of being hacked.
I've never used Electrum although I see it as well as Mycelium recommended frequently.
This should give you an idea of what choices are out there:
If I wanted to go with Electrum, I'd do a search in this forum for them and see what comments people make and what issues if any are mentioned.
Also I'd do a general internet search for "Electrum sucks" and see if you find any issues there.
But as mentioned, I do see it frequently praised.

 "In the United States, groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have expressed concern that money laundering rules require banks to report on their own customers, essentially conscripting private businesses "into agents of the surveillance state".[50]"

Kraken got me verified on 1-25 Wednesday.
(Thank you to kraken-thomas if it was your input that got it taken care of).
Gemini turns out to be the slowest.
Still not verified since 1-20.
They got in touch for the 1st time on 1-26 Thursday - having trouble verifying me, checking to see what other verification they can do.
In the last 2 months approved for 2 high end credit cards, an online checking account, 2 btc exchanges verified for Tier 3, but Gemini can't verify me.

This is not good advice.
At least in the USA, bringing chips to a cashier for the value of 3 BTC will cause the cashier to ask where they were obtained. 
Saying "A friend bought them and gave them to me" will raise red flags and at the least cause further interrogation and the possibility of not being allowed to cash them in. 
Also the possibility of confiscation.
Casino chips are not fiat/currency.

"You could still empty your account by requesting a cashier's check."
This is possible, but I would call them to make sure.
I've never seen an option for that on their site.
"And I'd assume you can still empty your account by ACH if you initiate the transfer at the receiving institution. Example: Purchase arbitrarily large quantities of mutual funds by ACH transfer. What's Capital One 360 going to do? Reject the ACH transaction even though you have the funds in your account?"
Reread the OP.
My reading of it was that they would reject it either way - them pushing it out or another bank pulling it out - if over the limit.
"Your 360 accounts will now be subject to limits on the amount of electronic transfers between your account and external accounts at other financial institutions."
I called Capital One, and the cs rep read the email (they had also received a copy) and after reading it she also said it sounds like it applies both ways.
"That'd be fraudulent."
Their definition of fraud is very likely different from yours.
Incidentally, I called within 24 hours after the email was sent out and there was a 10 minute plus wait to reach a cs rep, which is unusual in my experience.
I asked if the reason was the email, and was told "That's a big part of it".
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:36:12
I did not do this, but one can import from the exchanges you used into their software.
CS by email is pretty good - generally 1 - 2 days for a response.
The learning curve on using it is tough - a lot of it is not really intuitive - but the cs will answer your questions.
Once I figured out how to use it, I liked it pretty much.
Bitcoin.tax I emailed several times for cs help, never got a response.
I asked on their forum on reddit if anyone ever had, and one person said he thought they'd responded to him once.
So I don't think my experience was unusual.
EDIT - One important caveat with cointracking.info - I found that their historical prices for BTC were way off in many cases, and never close to my contemporaneous records nor to Coinbase's price archive.
I inputted the daily market price myself rather than using their prices.
If that's too much work for you, you could always let their software input their prices and hope for the best. They could be off to your advantage I guess.

1) "I didn’t say wallets I said exchanges."
My mistake.
But the withdrawal limits and fees are posted on the exchange, it is not a secret withheld from the customer by the exchange.
I could deal with this if Capital One was transparent (depending on the terms, or at least assurance that they would not stop another bank with higher limits from being able to pull out of my account via ACH).
But not if it's a secret, and subject to change at any time to anything with no advance notice.
2) I can keep my BTC on my hardware (or software) wallet, np.
But it is not advisable for me to keep my fiat at home. 
I do not store my BTC on an exchange, I use the exchange to buy/sell.
No one should store their BTC on an exchange unless they use it daily or almost for trading.
But I keep my fiat in a bank account (or, several accounts).
I am forced to deal with banks for fiat storage.
Alternatives like burying it in a coffee can in the backyard under the 2nd old oak tree, or under the mattress, are unwise. Likewise keeping it in a safe at home.
And with the rise of the surveillance state and police forfeiture, it is dangerous to hold large amounts of fiat not in a bank.
In order to store my BTC I am not forced  to deal with exchanges or banks or the gummint.
Thus, as the popular saying goes, I am my own bank with BTC. Not with fiat.

The hardware wallets give 12 or 24 words which is your backup and are unique to your account.
If you lose your wallet or it becomes non\-functional, get another one \- Trezor/Ledger or some free software wallets will also work with this, enter the passwords, and you are readmitted to your account.
This works even if the hardware wallet company goes out of business \- it works independently of them.
Never write the passwords on a computer ever. Keep a copy safely stored somewhere such as a safe deposit box.
As added security, add one extra word at the end which you memorize and do not have that on your stored copy of your passwords. (Although you may wish to write it down also \- people do get blank at times).
The Trezor User Manual has info on this and its advantages for plausible deniability \- their website will have the info.

I was responding to a comment specifically relating to USA taxation figures.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:30:55
Almost everyone reading this is going to have a hard time getting their cash from the exchange.
The exchange is going to change the BTC to USD and take their fee.
After that, they will ask for further info from you, with about a dozen extremely intrusive questions, including demanding that you justify where the funds came from to buy the original BTC, show pay receipts from the job that provided the funds to buy the BTC and show copies of your IRS tax filings, and a lot more.
If you don't satisfy them, they will tell you that they can't send you the funds because they would be violating the USA's AML/KYC provisions.
This is the biggest problem we all will have.
I am including USA based licensed exchanges.
How do I know this?
Because it is already being done at exchanges when one goes over a certain amount of deposit/withdrawals/buy/sell. I am referring to accounts which have ALREADY provided all personal information and been approved, and for customers who are staying within the exchange's stated limits for buy/sell and deposit/withdraw.
This is something that should concern all of us.

One can recover one's BTC from an existing established Trezor account to many wallets with the seed to the Trezor account.
But one's BTC (keys) are not going to "recover" into the Trezor from a wallet if there was no previous Trezor wallet account created.
EDIT - I can't think of any case where BTC (keys) in a wallet other than in Trezor's online wallet are going to "recover" into Trezor.
You always have to pay the fees and move them into the Trezor.

PayPal may possibly shut down your account, but I haven't paid attention to any situations with them.
They've been known to close accounts for all sorts of reasons.
I don't know at what point Coinbase would ask for more info from you, and they (and other exchanges) don't give advance warning.
With some exchanges, when one gets to 10 - 15k USD they may request more info, some may wait for 30k area, maybe more (maybe a lot more).
But I think every exchange - USA and foreign based - that is AML/KYC compliant will give people problems.
The OP asked about one million in holdings. 
I'm positive there will be hassles trying to sell that amount 
BTC to USD, and even more so in getting the exchange to send the USD once converted.
(It's win/win for the exchanges - convert and earn the fees, then ask for more info and perhaps keep the USD and blame it on the USA's banking laws.
And then if you're fortunate and it hits your USA bank, it's again win/win for your bank to try to hold onto it after putting you thru the same intrusive interrogation bullshit).

I won't need them for funds, and am a long term hodler.
So it would really be needed in case of a really special circumstance.

"There’s little way to prove it was income for you... The laws are going to things significantly, but we have institutional inertia on our side. Also, in a large organization like a government, the left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing."
The USA's IRS is almost certainly going to succeed in getting Coinbase to turn over records for 14k plus customers who have had more than 20k in Deposits or Withdrawals or Buys or Sells total from 2013 - 2015.
The history of US GOV intrusion is that the laws always become increasingly intrusive, and never less so.
So that is opening the floodgates and next they will ask for people who have had over 10k in transactions, etc.
And they won't just be asking Coinbase for those records.
Also, with the price of BTC continually increasing, more and more people will be going over those limits.

"What were people doing? They were taking out risky loans to buy houses in hopes of housing prices would increase and they'd be able to sell for a greater amount. They were taking out equity in their homes to purchase other homes in hopes that they be able to sell for a greater amount."
This is as much an exaggeration as that "The amount of people taking out loans to buy BTC is scary."
Brokers were making a fortune on loans for houses.
Most purchasers simply wanted a home.
Formerly banks were careful of those they made home loans to because they were going to be paid back directly.
But instead the banks were now selling those mortgages to others, which were then bundled in with actual AAA equities. The bulk of the package was worthless debt paper such as those mortgages.
So the banks had no interest in vetting the borrowers properly but accepted everything - they were making loans that could not possibly be paid back.
They were actively soliciting any and all customers and giving out loans freely.

I just thought of a different way to explain that may make it clear:
You can recreate the Trezor account. It will be exactly as it was.
If your BTC keys were in there, they are still in there.
Whatever you MOVED INTO THERE is still there.
It's like if you forget your bank account info for bank  you give the bank your ID and get back into the account.
But if you open another bank account ( in a different bank, you can't go to bank  and show your ID and make the money in bank  appear in bank 
You have to transfer it in there.

tradingH - "But when you read a news like that early in the morning, why you don't sell your overprice coin and by them back later in the day, when the news have made the tour of the globe and the BTC have drop 4-500$ ?"
1) It's easy in hindsight to know how it affected the market, not as easy in foresight.
2) If one is in the USA, one owes short term Capital Gains Tax upon sale.
3) Moving money from the exchange to one's bank and back a few times, or even once, can result in the closure of one's bank account.
4) The climb back can be very rapid and it could take hours or days to get the USD back from one's bank to the exchange.
5) If there's a problem anywhere along the line, the exchange and/or bank can take days to weeks to months to resolve the issue.
There are more reasons, but there's a few important ones off the cuff.

They had previously (and perhaps still, I don't know) accepted funds and crypto without verification.
When people try to withdraw, they are told they need to be verified - something that should have occurred when they tried to deposit.
Then in many noted cases, Bittrex takes weeks to months to never doing the verification.
This is unprofessional and outrageous. The deposits should have been denied.
And the verifications they demand should be performed in a timely manner.

Check the terms carefully.
At least one Thai exchange stipulates that only funds earned in Thailand [or some similar terms] can be used, and Baht obtained for selling BTC must remain in Thailand (so you could have problems withdrawing it from a Thai bank should you deposit it and/or taking it out of the country).

tradingH - "But when you read a news like that early in the morning, why you don't sell your overprice coin and by them back later in the day, when the news have made the tour of the globe and the BTC have drop 4-500$ ?"
1) It's easy in hindsight to know how it affected the market, not as easy in foresight.
Likewise for knowing when it has bottomed.
And what is "overpriced"? No one would buy and the price will never increase if all believe it is "overpriced". Many believe it is underpriced, which is why they buy, and that the eventual price will be 5 to 7 figures.
2) If one is in the USA, one owes short term Capital Gains Tax upon sale if one has held the BTC for less than one year.
Or long term Capital Gains Tax otherwise. Short term has a much higher tax rate.
3) Moving money from the exchange to one's bank and back a few times, or even once, can result in the closure of one's bank account.
It is risky to leave USD or BTC on an exchange.
4) The climb back can be very rapid and it could take hours or days to get the USD back from one's bank to the exchange.
5) If there's a problem anywhere along the line, the exchange and/or bank can take days to weeks to months to resolve the issue.
There are more reasons, but there's a few important ones off the cuff.

No ideas on a lawyer for you.
I'd keep tabs on the NYDFS's schedule for your case, and if you're able to find out when it gets assigned to a case worker ask for that person's phone  they may not be willing to give you until that person's initial report is complete) and call, then explain your urgent situation.
But it's a process there - Gemini gets x amount of time to respond, etc.
You may not be able to speed it up.
You could always get a local lawyer - or find a NY lawyer perhaps - to write Gemini a letter in hopes of getting them moving.

"Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices at the time of their introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.
The 1637 event was popularized in 1841 by the book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written by British journalist Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb.[10] Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.[11][12][13]"

So anotherwords your theory is that the cs team is so poorly trained and managed that if they deem someone to be rude and their widdle feefees get rattled they punish them by taking weeks or months to take care of serious financial issues, in many cases costing customers a great deal of money?

It's normal when linking bank accounts for ACH to have a choice - 
Login thru the site, or, make 2 small trial deposits and one verifies the amounts deposited.
I've always done the latter even though it takes a few days.
It is not safe to let them have one's login info and yes, they can then know as much as you about your bank account - and it's none of their business.
Can Gemini customers confirm that no choice is given - the only option is to give Gemini one's login info (i.e., sign in thru the Gemini site)?

It seems likely that "Tulip mania" never existed as it is popularly portrayed:
"The 1637 event was popularized in 1841 by the book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written by British journalist Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb.[10] Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.[11][12][13]"
"Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices at the time of their introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers."
"Mackay's account of inexplicable mania was unchallenged, and mostly unexamined, until the 1980s.[39] However, research into tulip mania since then, especially by proponents of the efficient-market hypothesis,[13] suggests that his story was incomplete and inaccurate. In her 2007 scholarly analysis Tulipmania, Anne Goldgar states that the phenomenon was limited to "a fairly small group", and that most accounts from the period "are based on one or two contemporary pieces of propaganda and a prodigious amount of plagiarism".[8] Peter Garber argues that the bubble "was no more than a meaningless winter drinking game, played by a plague-ridden population that made use of the vibrant tulip market."[40]"
"Despite the mania's enduring popularity, Daniel Gross of Slate has said of economists offering efficient-market explanations for the mania, that "If they're correct ... then business writers will have to delete Tulipmania from their handy-pack of bubble analogies."[68]"

"Have him buy chips with the bills."
Casinos want customers to buy chips at the gaming tables.
Many (most?) casinos won't sell you chips at the cage.
"Meet the guy at the cage. Have him buy chips with the bills. When the cashier takes the bills they're passed through the fastest and most rigorous verification process in the world."
The "fastest and most rigorous verification process in the world" is exactly the same as any bank or any other place with a Glory or similar counting machine.
"Chips he gives to you for the bitcoin. You cash the chips back out."
If you stand there and sell them right back, the cage will be extremely suspicious (wouldn't you be), and you will end up with Security questioning you.
If you go to another cage to cash the chips, you will be questioned as to where you got them unless you're dealing with small $$$ (less than 4 figures perhaps, depends on the casino).
And end up with Security questioning you.
Meeting in a casino is an excellent idea for people who have casinos in the neighborhood.

Traditional American values?
The values of slavery, genocide of native Americans, denying women and blacks the ability to vote, or recent American values - bombing countries like South Vietnam and Iraq back to the Stone Age after first lying about the need for war,  illegally spying on the populace, kidnapping people and then outsourcing torture, propping up several of the most fascistic regimes on Earth such as Saudi Arabia and Israel, murdering people of color with no consequences by police acting like an occupying army, running a gulag where people can be extrajudicially imprisoned forever without a trial, etc., etc.
Such values need to be desecrated.

The USA is a mega corporation.
The USA Gov't. is the executive board of the corporation.
Like every corporation, the only thing they are looking out for are profits.
The majority of the people of planet Earth believe that the biggest threat to world peace is the USA.
"The United States is the greatest threat to world peace. That’s the finding of an end-of-the- year, WIN/Gallup International survey of people in 65 countries.
Of the 66,000 people polled, just under a quarter named Uncle Sam as the greatest threat to world peace.
Other menaces didn’t even come close: 8 percent named Pakistan, putting that country in second place, while 6 percent named China. A mere 4 percent found Iran threatening — which tied it with Israel."

"Mackay's account of inexplicable mania was unchallenged, and mostly unexamined, until the 1980s.[39] However, research into tulip mania since then, especially by proponents of the efficient-market hypothesis,[13] suggests that his story was incomplete and inaccurate. In her 2007 scholarly analysis Tulipmania, Anne Goldgar states that the phenomenon was limited to "a fairly small group", and that most accounts from the period "are based on one or two contemporary pieces of propaganda and a prodigious amount of plagiarism".[8] Peter Garber argues that the bubble "was no more than a meaningless winter drinking game, played by a plague-ridden population that made use of the vibrant tulip market."[40]"

I've thought a bit about this as well as storing a hardware wallet and seed in a safe deposit box when on extended travel abroad.
I decided I would leave the Trezor in one box and the seed in a box at a different branch or at a different bank.
In the extremely unlikely event of the safe deposit boxes being broken into, or, as someone mentioned already in this thread, the bank opening one's box for whatever reason, a rogue employee/IRS agent/LEO/whatever will not have everything they need to steal one's coins.
A woman in a Youtube video speaking about BTC suggested storing the items in evidence bags which LEO's use. Once sealed the envelope/bag is partially destroyed if anyone opens it so there is no question if it's been opened or remained sealed.
I checked for these on Amazon but it was either buy a huge amount of them, or buy ones which seemed inferior like pseudo evidence bags. So I've given up on that for the time being but would like to buy a few if I can find something suitable.
I also have signed my name on the back of my hardware wallet in Magic Marker, so that the wallet can't be swapped for an identical one by someone who has access to it.

tradingH - "But when you read a news like that early in the morning, why you don't sell your overprice coin and by them back later in the day, when the news have made the tour of the globe and the BTC have drop 4-500$ ?"
1) It's easy in hindsight to know how it affected the market, not as easy in foresight.
2) If one is in the USA, one owes short term Capital Gains Tax upon sale.
3) Moving money from the exchange to one's bank and back a few times, or even once, can result in the closure of one's bank account.
4) The climb back can be very rapid and it could take hours or days to get the USD back from one's bank to the exchange.
5) If there's a problem anywhere along the line, the exchange and/or bank can take days to weeks to months to resolve the issue.
There are more reasons, but there's a few important ones off the cuff.

This is absolutely not a solution.
There is a paper trail of depositing the Euros, paying a currency transaction fee, and very likely being questioned by the bank and the bank possibly filing a SAR.
If he does not pay tax on this the first time the IRS looks at him he faces huge fines, back taxes, and possible tax evasion charges.
Depositing Euros initially rather than USD does not change anything except probably add more suspicion on the part of the authorities.

As HeritageSports pointed out, what if they had mistakenly said you lost the bet.

The same fairness applies to them getting paid if they made a mistake and paid you by mistake.
You may not be unhappy with the order it was done in, but the result is the same.

What is your criteria for accepting customers for buying/selling?
"They show me the money..."
Do they put it on the table, or pocket it again is ok?
Has anyone ever gotten up after you sent to them without paying?
Your method is safe if you are buying, as you are not handing over cash until you receive - how many notifications do you wait for?
But if you are sending, you are of course vulnerable to someone walking off.

This was answered well by buwaytress on your bitcointalk thread:
"I'm with DarkDays on this one. It's actually pretty clear cut. You tried (successfully) to take winnings from a misgraded wager. Nitrogen is actually one of the better bookies out there simply because they grade quickly... but of course, they do run the risk of making mistakes like in this fight.
You seem to acknowledge yourself that you shouldn't have won this, and had you read their full terms and conditions, you'd find yourself the guilty party. Every bookie graded this at UNDER 9.5 in the end. A mistake was made, and they were merely correcting it."
You even post "Well, if they feel that money does not belong to me they should have claimed it right there."
You withdrew before they were aware of the mistake.
Once they were, they took back the mistakenly paid money.
What's the difference if they took it earlier or later?

But to clarify: "...the seed words allow you to retreive your wallet and all the coins."
If the wallet falls overboard, you can get a new one, and the seed (words) will restore the private keys to the new wallet.
"I do this overtime I make a purchase and over time I will have a large accumulation of bitcoins on this physical wallet."
Every bitcoin ever created is on the blockchain.
The wallet contains the private keys that show your ownership of your coins on the blockchain. No coins are ever in the wallet.

They have more customers than most (all?) exchanges = more profits than other exchanges which should equal more cs reps than other exchanges.
But they have always been awful on cs since they started and they have never ramped up.
Many/most exchanges are now back to efficient cs with 24 hours max response time, but as posters in this thread make clear Coinbase is at 4 months response for serious problems.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:54:54
"With their current level of nonexistent customer service they will have no chance to compete in this market place in the long term."
If an exchange that accepted USD came along and was willing to have 24/7 phone support and were otherwise minimally competent for cs and website, they would take over the marketplace.
And definitely destroy Coinbase.

Sounds like a ripoff to me if the price wasn't disclosed and you were then charged from 1.5 to 3.0 times what you were told it would cost.
"With that said, lesson to be learned here is to ASK many questions about fees when hiring a law firm so nothing comes later as a surprise."
My takeaway from your experience is to get the estimate in writing via email.
That would give you a solid argument for not paying the overcharge.
I also don't see it as being your fault in any way - as you explain it, you went over your tax situation with him and he estimated the cost with a big spread of $800 to $1600.
To then charge you $2500 seems clearly unfair. Especially as he could have contacted you when the accountants started working on your returns and warned you of the higher cost if he hadn't paid attention during your $200 consultation.
Also - Just about any CPA/EA/Tax Preparer in the US will give a free consultation.
I was also told it would be $200 /half hour for a consultation, which I find outrageous and I chose to go elsewhere.
People going to him to have their taxes prepared are not seeking legal representation - and for that matter, most attorneys will give a free consultation.
Thank you for the report.

"I'm saying that the world now is far more peaceful than it has ever been in the 2000 years before 1945."
Define what is meant by "more peaceful".
I realize that the Ministry of Propaganda came out with that claim several years ago and as we see it is still repeated.
But what truth to that claim?
I can only assume that peace means "not formally declared wars in progress" which is meaningless as wars are not declared any more but instead there are "peacekeepers" ("War is Peace"), "insurgents", "counter insurgents", rebels, "terrorists", etc.
War is rarely formally declared anymore because the war is constant and forever.

"They can be as suspicious as they like - you can do what you want with your casino chips. As for security questioning you, that's just not true. I've spent more time in casinos than most casino employees and there isn't one in the world that would harass customers that way. Excellent way to keep people from coming into the building at all. But if you're worried about it, take the chips, put them in your pocket, walk around for five minutes, cash them out. Or just hold on to them - they're as good as cash."
"...they're as good as cash."
Tell that to Nolan Dalla. 
(Surprised you're not aware of this, being a professional poker player etc.)
"Chips no longer good as cash"
" 'Chips absolutely aren't legal tender. They're the property of the casino,' MGM Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman said. 'They are tendered for a very specific purpose and that purpose is highly regulated. We are obligated to verify that the chips were obtained through appropriate and normal gambling activity.' "
"Every casino I've ever been to prefers you to buy chips at the cage and may allow it at the table. I was a professional poker player."
I assume you're referring to the poker room cage, not the main casino cage. You didn't specify that earlier. Yes, I agree that in a casino poker room they want one to buy at the poker room cage and/or at the table. The rest of the casino, no.
"Casinos do not pry into their customers' monetary privacy."

The reason I asked is this, which seems to me to contradict what you state, but I assume I'm misunderstanding it:
"So who is SegWit for?
Everyone will benefit from using SegWit accounts. If you do not wish to move your funds, at least accept payments into your new accounts. If you receive bitcoins often, the new SegWit accounts will allow you to send BTC at an efficient cost. (Please keep in mind that until third party wallets implement SegWit support, your TREZOR SegWit accounts will be invisible to them.)"
"(Please keep in mind that until third party wallets implement SegWit support, your TREZOR SegWit accounts will be invisible to them.)"

What is a "pop-up" shop?
I see no connection with selling coats/clothes and needing to record each one on the blockchain - nor how that is possible.
"The main reason is that we think this can push transparency in the marketplace. There's no way to really know if what a company says about their product is true, but if the product can be traced in a way that prevents misinformation then there's no need to trust a company's word, you can see it for yourself. And this gives real world use for blockchain tech for the every day person, something crucial for the acceptance of crytpocurrencies for the everyday person."
This reads like gibberish to me.
What claims are made about a piece of clothing that needs transparency and can be given that transparency by being listed on the blockchain?

All BTC exists on the internet in the blockchain. 
Your wallet holds your private keys, which show your ownership of your coins.
You would have to withdraw from the Trezor to an exchange, sell the BTC for fiat such as USD, then have the exchange get the USD to you and you deposit it into your bank.
As someone suggests below, definitely read a few beginner articles and watch a few basic videos. People here can be helpful but you really need to exert some minimal effort on your own first. I suggest doing that  before posting more questions.. There's tons of stuff on Youtube, and recommendations on the right side of this page.

The default Trezor account has a 24 word seed.
It's possible to add a password or a passphrase to the original account, or to set up an additional account by choosing the passphrase option.
This is not stored in the device. It's up to the user to store the added passphrase off device.
Multiple additional accounts can be created within the wallet by adding additional passphrases.
In each case the passphrase becomes the 25th word to the seed.

The only thing I would add (I made the same move from blockchain.info to Trezor) is put a minute amount of BTC into the Trezor first, wipe your Trezor, and recover it with the seed.
That way you can feel secure that you are safe if the Trezor is lost/stolen/damaged.
I did not use a passphrase when I first setup the Trezor, but will be adding one today.

This estimate is undoubtedly low, considering reliable data is only available for airstrikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Libya, and a single "strike," according to the Pentagon’s definition, can involve multiple bombs or munitions.

Everybody who's followed BTC and/or studied it's price history can predict there will be large drops - and also large recoveries. 
Predicting at what price the rises or the falls will occur would be impressive - simply pointing out that you were aware the price would eventually drop, and then eventually rise, is not impressive.

Let's keep in mind - 
If the allegations are true that he tried to hire hitmen to have a few people killed - people commit actual crimes that affect people for the rest of their lives, or end lives - (child) rapists, murderers, mutilators, etc. - who do not get life without parole.
Ross could've gotten 20 years instead of life.
And if the allegations are true and the Hells Angel was actually a LEO - it wasn't as if Ross was actively seeking hitmen. 
One was dropped in his lap and he went with it.
If the allegations are true, he committed a crime according to the law by going along with it.
But it is not as if he was actively searching for this. 
There's no evidence that if the Hells Angel didn't appear, he would have pursued this.

"And he somehow has never been "given" anything to undermine the Russian propaganda agenda. What a coincidence...."
Coincidence has nothing to do with it.
He received info on the Democrats and not the Republicans.
Very simple.
Beyond that, it doesn't matter in the end what the provenance of the info was - the courageous part was publishing it and informing the public.
The USA has interfered not only with elections but has helped to overthrow numerous regimes around the world including those that were democratically elected.

Assange is a fearless publisher who challenges authority.

"1. Attacking a person's character or motivations rather than a position or argument"
His position is well known - publishing hidden truths and exposing those in power.
When you attack his character you are making an ad hominem attack.
If it makes your widdle fee fees any better, let's call it a baseless, subjective, and irrelevant attack.
"...he is a slimy git" - what sort of insane narcissism makes you feel your calling him that diminishes him in anyone's eyes?
"And rather than suppose that everyone who went bail for him is OK about having to pay £tens of thousands, why don't you research it? (They aren't.)"

There are regulated financial markets investing in BTC Bitcoin.
When they find no uniformity - that BCH is calling itself "Bitcoin" - regulators/the state will eventually get involved as they will (rightfully) feel that BCH is scamming.
Do the people who don't understand the importance of the lawsuit - or another means to stop the Ver scamming - think that the regulated financial markets will stand for this?
Can 25 people separately hard fork BTC Bitcoin, set up 25 different websites, and each of them claim "Buy your BTC here"?

To be fair, cs is pretty abysmal for all exchanges - generally taking from a few days to a week or more to never, for exchanges where I have accounts.

Several people have made a similar suggestion.
I would not do this if it involves outright lying about the value of the btc stored on the device.
So far apparently it's been working for those who do that, but if they ever seized one they have the right to keep it for up to (I believe) 3 months.
If they find more on there than stated,  one is now open to them seizing the btc plus lying to Border and Customs.
From reading about Trezor, I don't see them being able to get in and see what's actually there, but I don't like the situation.
I'd rather tell them it's a 2FA device which it is basically and see how that goes.
Since the US has classified BTC as a capital asset and not currency, I don't see how one would be expected to declare the value of it when re-entering the country so afaik that's not an issue.
Any accountants here or others who know for sure the answer to that?
The US gov - federal, state, and local - love to seize money under any pretext they feel they can get away with, and do so on a regular basis.

Why I didn't sell although that had originally been my plan:
1) Trusting any exchange with a large amount of USD is not something I would do right now;
2) Bringing that USD to a US bank means Capital Gains tax, and will likely cause the bank account to be closed.
(Capital Gains tax when it's sold whether USD shipped to US or not).
3) Sending the cash back to an exchange, given the numerous posts here and elsewhere, can take weeks, and months if there is any snafu.
Once things after August 1st seem settled and the price starts to rise, how much will I miss out on before my funds are back in an exchange.
Plus could  cause the sending USD bank to close my account.
So I'm HODLING.

I wondered if that was the case.
It would've stopped them from doing the withdrawals they effected once he logged in.
And then in a normal financial business he would've called the Fraud Department or even basic CS and he could've locked down the account and re-established his identity, set a new pw, withdrawn all.
But in the BTC Exchange world - the alternate universe - Customer Service is close to non-existent without a wait of several days to several months to never.

"Coinbase Support is Completely non responsive"
Cs there has been worthless for years.
Unfortunately that's true of most BTC Exchanges as well.
The last priority for any of them is prompt customer support.
I have 2 banks with 7 day telephone cs till about 7pm.
All the others are 24/7 telephone support.
All credit cards are 24/7 telephone support.
Yet it's standard with BTC financial services to have to wait 3 days (minimum) or (a lot) more to get an email response.

Then they receive the SMS 2FA themselves on their own phone.

Thanks for the info.
Did he explain what the short term loan was for?
The borrower is willing to pay more than 20% interest (he's paying something to the broker you were dealing with, let's guess another 5% minimum) for an investment lasting less than 8 hours.
EDIT - How much did the broker say he earns from the borrower?
If he's earning something like the 5% I mentioned he's an idiot and it's an obvious scam.
What could possibly generate more than ~25% profit in 8 hours on a continuing basis?
Also - the broker should have been borrowing money, buying btc, and raking in the 20 % interest plus his fee.
If this kept up, he'd be a millionaire very rapidly.
And - Why doesn't the borrower just use LBC and buy the btc he needs?
I assume the broker is getting collateral to guarantee the loan - so the borrower has the cash to buy the btc himself.
This just seems awfully obvious.

False, based on the wording of the ruling.
It's clear that it is cumulative within the year for one type of transaction.
I.e., a total of 20k in transfers for all the transfers made that year.

"I've also considered selling (I know, I know) a portion of my BTC, moving to fiat, and buying back in at a lower price."
I considered doing this also.
Outside of market timing (at which I've failed miserably in 3 attempts):
1) It's highly likely one's bank account will be shut down with a decent amount of money coming in based on selling crypto.
2) This also triggers a Capital Gain if there has been a profit.
3) Getting a decent amount of money from one's new bank account (after the original was shut down) to a crypto exchange I think will then be more difficult than it was to get the cash from the sale of the cryptos to one's bank was.
4) Because the crypto exchanges cs was inadequate when they had many less customers, it is atrocious now.
If there is any problem sending/receiving fiat, it can easily be a month before there is a resolution.

I thought at first it meant 20k on any single transaction, but re-reading it I now feel it has to mean a cumulative 20k during the year on buying or sending or selling. A cumulative 20k during the year in any one of those categories.

To be fair - My cell provider officially ends general support in the evening, I'm not sure what time. I think there is a difficult way to get tech support still but I'm not sure.
I've found a way to get excellent 24/7 phone support - however, for people who haven't found this, support does end in the evening each day.
"Credit cards and transaction providers are probably the only areas you can get 24/7 support for any need."
Yes, I agree, I was thinking credit cards.
Most of my banks have 24/7 telephone support but one non-nationwide bank doesn't, and internet banks or the one I use are also not open all night for phone support.
But here's the biggest difference - if not 24/7, I can get help by the next morning 7 days.
It would be unthinkable for a phone carrier or a bank to be incommunicado for 5 days - or 2 days.
And I and probably you would switch banks if that was the case.
The exchanges were massively understaffed when things were slow because the attitude for all of them was "Let's increase profits by making the customers wait".
When the amount of customers shot up exponentially it quickly got out of control.
Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to tell if a company is spiralling downward, preparing to Gox, or just incompetent.

What fee did you anticipate paying?
Or rather - if you had withdrawn the amount you deposited and had it returned to you via whatever method they used - what would the fee have been normally?
Also - is there any reason you can think of for them terminating your account?

"How far back can the IRS go to audit my return?
Generally, the IRS can include returns filed within the last three years in an audit. If we identify a substantial error, we may add additional years. We usually don’t go back more than the last six years."
"The statute of limitations limits the time allowed to assess additional tax. 
It is generally three years after a return is due or was filed, whichever is later."

I'm very interested because I'm in the USA and can't use Coinbase or Gemini.
Thus far only used Bitstamp for a few trades, no USD withdrawal, but have been happy with my experiences thus far and was hoping I could safely use them for that should I want to cashout.
But your case is very disturbing.
At the same time, they did return your funds, and 3 weeks seems to unfortunately be fast these days for issues at exchanges to be resolved.
I'm currently applying to some more exchanges.

Probably contacted by some whales who have the money to follow thru with a suit.

They don't mind screwing the thousands of small customers by having inadequate staff and the "technical problem" (??) of going down on every giant move.

Will you or someone else please explain:
E.g. I have 1 btc in a hardware wallet.
 August 1st arrives.
Do I now have 0.5 btc in 1 chain and 0.5 in the other?
Did my btc double and I now have 1.0 btc in one chain and 1.0 btc in the other?
If one chain increases 20% in value after a week and I want to put my coins into an exchange which trades with that chain, are my coins now worth 120% of what they were when the chain split?
Or are they somehow worth the amount at the time of the chain split?
I've never seen a cogent explanation of this but hoping you or someone else can ELI5 this.
I believe many think they will have double the amount of coins when there is a split which as I understand it currently is incorrect.

"I'm a simple person. All I want is email 2FA."
I understand, and felt the same way until very recently.
I was using blockchain.info (switching to Trezor), and would receive an email to confirm it's me, and then they'd send a login code to my phone.
But I'd like to urge you to use Authy, which is free and can be used instead of Google Authenticator but doesn't invade privacy the way the Google organization does.
Authy is easy to use, and has good and fairly fast email support.
People are porting one's phone number, and physically receiving your code on their phone.
It can unfortunately be done very easily.
Don't know the answer to your specific question, but if you are having trouble finding how to send a support ticket to blockchain.info - there is a link at the end of each of their knowledge base articles on the site.

Note also that after a bank closes one's account, they will usually (to be safe, I would say "always") follow up by closing one's credit cards though usually not immediately but fairly soon after (perhaps a month).
So if a bank account gets shut down, transfer out your points if possible/cash out your points/buy something with them quick if you use them for travel.

"I would prefer to avoid legal action, since I have never done that, and I am scared that Gemini could threaten me to close my account, or counter sue me. I just want my money back."
1) They will not counter sue you. (What grounds do they have?)
2) It's possible they are already planning to close your account. If so, move on. And after it happens, make a 2nd complaint to the NYSDFS that they closed your account after you attempted to resolve your important financial issue and their total lack of customer service and their non-response.

I started this thread 1 month ago.
The majority of people who expressed an opinion thought I was being unnecessarily paranoid.
Since then, "The House of Representatives is considering the 'Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies Act,' which calls for the government to conduct an investigation into whether virtual currencies like bitcoin could be more security trouble than they’re worth."
as well as this:
"Forfeit Your Bitcoin? Congressional Bill Draws Fire Over Border Check Rules 
A group of US lawmakers wants to see cryptocurrency holdings declared at the nation's border – and advocates of the tech are pushing back.
Introduced last month, the Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 – which is actually the third iteration of a bill that debuted in 2011 – would bring a range of digital currency services under federal scrutiny, including those that provide transaction mixing services.
Yet, the provision that has attracted the particular ire of cryptocurrency advocates – especially those who prefer a regulation-light environment – is one that would make such holdings subject to disclosure requirements at US customs checkpoints. This means if a person trying to enter the country has more than $10,000 worth of bitcoin in their possession, under the proposed legal change, they would need to inform the relevant authorities."
Going back over 3 years ago, the TSA thought they saw bitcoins in someone's airport baggage and wanted to count it to make sure he wasn't carrying over 10k without declaring it.
Be careful flying internationally.
And be careful driving in the USA - once the thieves with badges realize that people have wallets on their phone with btc they'll start seizing them under the forfeiture laws if they can come up with an excuse.
These "forfeitures" (legal thefts) fund many police departments.

It's my understanding that the safest thing one can do when using any internet access, even more so when travelling, is to use a VPN so what you are sending back and forth is encrypted.
There are a lot of stupid rules out there, but it would be seriously ignorant and dangerous for exchanges to make an issue of using a VPN.
Also, if you look at how to tweak Firefox here:
privacytools.io - it's extremely unlikely anyone will catch it even if you are using a VPN.
That site also has a list of VPN's devoted to privacy.

"As someone mentioned before, when you get your hardware wallet, test your recovery key."
How would one do that?
If my coins are in the Trezor, I can enter the backup code anyway?
This won't create a problem with the coins in there and future transactions?
Or do you mean test the backup before depositing anything in the new Trezor wallet?
And if so, still not sure how?
I know it means entering 24 (I think) words. But then what happens and how does it affect the existing (original) setup?
