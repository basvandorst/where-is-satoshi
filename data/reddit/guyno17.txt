Does complete block ever happened in history? If no, is it possible? No way around?
Edit: yea total internet shutdown is totally possible, but i think sandboxing internet so that only own continues is not possible completely, there will be always a way to bypass that.

If your email and phone verified and if localbitcoins share them with IRS then IRS may easily get you.
Other than this localbitcoins may also keep a log of someone's IP address and chats that it may handover them when needed.
So it is better to pay tax and live a peaceful life.

Which of these altcoins are completely decentralised and open source? I am looking to keep a very small quantity of them.

MEW works offline, it only uses internet to download whole websites in your browser, it doesn't use internet afterwards, except when you check you wallet balance.
You can generate a new wallet like this:
Open myetherwallet website 
Disconnect internet 
Generate new wallet
Save your keys
Close browser 
Now you may Connect to internet again.

I also wanted to pay namecheap via bitcoin but now I can't. I hope they will change their bitcoin payment processor soon.

There is a possibility that your wallet is not synced properly so it is not showing correct balance, it happened with me once, try using another wallet software to check balance.

Maybe some of your browser extension is doing this, it is pretty easy job for them to inject JavaScript into your web pages even you if you are offline and save the keys to their storage and sync it to their server once you get online.

At least she doesn't watch "Tarak mehta ka ulta casma", now I can feel your pain and I feel sorry for you more than myself. Btw she watch 6 different serials daily. Thanks for suggestions tho. I need to do something about it.


Already doing this she is still watching 
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:18:18
I tried multiple times, most of the time I make her watch Hollywood movies so that we don't have to watch daily shop, but as soon as time comes for these serials she start emotional drama like I cook food for everyone, clean house bla bla bla bla everyday like a servant and can't even watch my favorite serials.

People still enjoy watching this shit in India every day. I have to sit facing opposite side of my dining room tv because I can't handle this anymore and you don't want to mess with Indian mothers while they are watching these.
For more

Wtf is happening?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:25:02
Thank you so much for replying.
Any recommendations for iOS wallets for such transactions (buying domain,hosting from namecheap etc) with lower fees and higher safety?
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:30:56
Newbie here
I want to pay a similar "BitPay invoice" (for domain name) generated by namecheap.
I have my bitcoin in another wallet not in BitPay, can I pay this invoice with any bitcoin wallet. Or they only allow to pay via BitPay wallet.
BitPay's docs say they recommend BitPay app, but does not says anything about it is payable via another wallet or not.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:57:36
Breadwallet is segwit? Can i pay BitPay invoice using it?

The whole idea of decentralised cryptocurrency is remove control of anyone other than you on your money, no government have ability to ban it completely, so fuck what government say or do. All they can do is create FUD that leads to price drop, but sooner or later it will be stable.
Our government &amp; news runs by bunch of idiots who are don't understand a bit of it, they are trying to stop the future, like closing eyes in daylight and say it's night. These fuckheads thinks they can ban cryptocurrencies. ��
