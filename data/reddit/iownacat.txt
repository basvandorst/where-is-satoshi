Problem for people dumb enough to use gox. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 23:27:03
that is an odd spelling of 'retarded'
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:05:19
I laughed way too hard at that...

They violated rules by altering the app after approval.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:37:50
Nobody is stupid enough to believe this, right?
Please tell me no!

No sorry, it was stupid at the time as well. Exchanges are not banks, you are being foolish by considering them as such. Unless you need to do something immediately there is no reason to ever keep anything on an exchange. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:56:30
well if you are day trading and require assets to be on an exchange at all time you should know your accounts are always at risk. You should be intelligent enough to know the history of the issues with gox, if not, you are probably a bad trader anyway. 
Anyone who stored wealth they couldn't afford to lose - that was a very bad idea. Consider this a life lesson.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:06:43
Yeah and on top of that the app looked much different when it was approved - they changed the app post-approval. They broke rules to get it in in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:07:28
You are confusing things here. Investing in bitcoin is one thing, but leaving funds on gox was pretty damn stupid. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:57:10
Why would you do this? Was it to avoid paying taxes?

Maybe he is drunk?

Ive read more books about the fed than you can count, and Ive know about this since before you were born. You are mentally ill if you think the money trust will legitimize a decentralized currency they do not control. Like, seriously fucking retarded, to the point where I am embarrassed for you. You can continue to play this game but you and I both know how fucking stupid you are.

They disabled my debit card while purchasing GPUs.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:44:52
Is this why my debit card got cancelled after I purchased 4 GPUs? I have yet to call them back to resolve this, but they just turned off my debit card. Its starting to make sense now....
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:13:37
hah you got downvoted for that...
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:08:42
Yeah its got nothing to do with the fact that BTC could ultimately destroy their business, nor the fact that FINCEN just said BTC is a pretty poor and traceable form of money laundering. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:20:26


so are you delusional or a comedian? Either way, its good stuff...
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:18:34
Do people still believe this shit? Its a well known fact that the fed tells the president who to appoint. This country has no idea....
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:34:18
Yes, no shit. We know how fraud prevention works. I purchase large amounts of electronics all the time. Ive dealt with fraud prevention. I understand the confusion because most of reddit  are dumb teenagers but cmon, this is obvious shit. You dont need to type paragraph after paragraph about fraud prevention lol. 
What I find funny is I buy shit all the time, but they decided to make it difficult while I was hunting down GPUs. Chase can go fuck themselves. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:16:25
You are retarded if you think the fed will ever legitimize bitcoin, and I laugh at you because your fantasies are so delusional there is no other appropriate response. You also don't comprehend the true relationship the fed has with gold (nor how little it actually holds, nor how it uses it to manipulate the dollar) so spare me what you learned in Econ class last week lol. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:30:26
Its called being a delusional idiot. That will never happen in a billion years. You need to educate yourself about the fed and the treasury, because so far you are displaying the comprehension of a teenager. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:11:59
Go back to class kid and stop beating the Ron Paul drum. It only makes you that much more retarded. 
Get back to me when the treasury decides to buy some BTC (possibly the stupidest prediction ever written on reddit)
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:35:33
Yawn. I just happen to know what the fed is and how it operates. This is not a debate, Im not attempting an argument. Im laughing and frankly shocked that people are still this stupid in this day and age. You live in a fantasy world where everything on tv is real. gfy
