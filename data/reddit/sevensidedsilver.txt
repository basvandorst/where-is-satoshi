By the numbers, there's no denying bitcoin is a better performer - especially on a long term investment.
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:15:13
You would own 0.17 BTC which is 17% of one coin - not 0.17 percent which would be about 20 dollars :P

Yeppp. OTC supplies aren't guaranteed by any means either - lot's of people speculate that if the OTC runs dry and all those investors are forced to exchanges we'll see some insane price action.

If you want the most secure, long term storage, destroy your ledger. Write down your seed words (in a weird order that you'll remember) and then erase any access to your private keys.   
2 wallets would be ok, if they're in separate secure locations. But the absolute best long term storage is just a memorized seed phrase with an obfuscated physical backup somewhere secure.
@_date: 2019-07-08 00:28:43
Someone doesn't become less wealthy when someone else becomes wealthy. Most wealthy people realize this more often than the non-wealthy. The "if you win, I lose" mentality really only exists in the middle/low class.
Also, the super wealthy are absolutely accumulating bitcoin - this entire bull run has been driven by institutional money. Retail (everyday consumer) interest hasn't moved at all.
@_date: 2019-07-30 02:05:35
Hence the obfuscated physical backup. I'm the first guy to tell people the risks of relying on memorization only... you don't choose what gets forgotten when you slip and bump your head.

Too late, I already locked in a massive trade at 10.5k right before the drop to sub 10  haha :/
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:27:29
It really doesn't work that way for anyone man.
Let's say I have a basic job at a grocery store or something and that you are homeless. If I see you sober up and get a job nearby, I am not making any less money at my work. 
Just because the wealth distribution is fucked (not saying that doesn't need attention/work), doesn't mean the rules change anywhere on the scale.
The same is true whether you're a doctor, a millionaire investor, an hourly laborer, or even somewhere in the 3rd world farming for a dime per day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:23
My strategy (which on a fundamental level supports crypto as a currency, not just a value holder) is to never trade - 
that is, I don't "cash out" back into USDs. I've already "cashed out" by buying crypto with fiat! I use my coins to buy off newegg, hosting, domains, ect... so I don't have any profits to report. I'm just using another currency. Not my fault people lowered their prices in that currency  ;)
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:31:01
Also buying anything with bitcoin is a taxable event equal to selling the quantity of bitcoin needed for the purchase
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:19:29
yep, I can afford to lose that money of course. You've got the right mindset - all this will potentially look like a pebble in the road 2 years from now. 
Honestly, I think the price will continue to drop until something gets done about the unconfirmed transactions. How are devs working to solve this? Is this what the lightening network addresses?
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:38:05
not bad for a first purchase - now focus on your career so you can make bigger buy ins :P
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:13:35

It might've been your first dip, but it's also the biggest one yet in bitcoins long history. We might see even worse in the future but ultimately, why sell? :)

how about this subreddit with every other post (or more) referring to the cost of a bitcoin in USD? Or almost any conversation about bitcoin being drawn to its price and investment opportunity? If you don't see evidence I dunno what to tell you.
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:56:20
Just in the last 19 years it lost 50% of it's value! Something that cost you $10 in the year 2000 today would cost you $15.  
The dollar gained 240% of its value from 1870 - 1970. It hasn't gone up a single percent since 1971 when the gold standard was dropped.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:25:06
I don't.
Cheap bitcoin is awesome when you look at the long term potential. I'm buying aggressively as possible while its less than 15k.

small chunks! 
I don't dollar cost average but I do buy 2-3 chunks every pay period. It's a little more fun trying to pick the weekly low. Overall tho I just don't let my bank account get too big. If it's feeling inflated I'll make a big buy - even if it seems like a weekly high price.

I'm confused how other currencies are sustainable. If banks can print infinite money, how can the value be sustained? Couldn't someone or some group hoard power over that money and direct it into the market as they see fit?   
The finite nature of bitcoin is definitely one of its strengths. In the past, millions of coins have been lost because of lost keys - now that's getting rarer and rarer as bitcoin grows in value.  
The decentralized nature of bitcoin doesn't guarantee against whales driving the market - they do. But this is the case with most markets: oil, stocks, and metals.

For me, I am holding it until mass adoption. I don't really use it as currency now except to buy the odd computer part and sometimes internet domains.  
Once it has more use, it'll have more stability. One day people may not even consider comparing bitcoins to dollars as a valid way to measure what its worth. We're still in the very early phases!
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:37:40
Yep - every sale is taxable. Also, its a "first in, first out" style of taxing. 
This means that if you buy 4 coins as the price increases, then sell 2 coins, you file your gains for the first 2 coins you bought. You can't say "oh I'm selling the last two coins I bought".

Don't day trade.
The best advice has already been said: buy and hold long term.
I personally have most of my holding on cold storage - but I do keep a small amount and do some swing trades (few days to a week plays). Most of the time I lose on those trades. Its kinda fun tho.
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:52:28
The blockchain has existed for a long time (1990 or 91) - bitcoin is the first valuable application of blockchain.

The bull market won't be determined by minnow noobs who panic sell on a drop. Like every other market, its driven by whales making moves.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:51:53
Was wondering the same about my ledger - I have 2 accounts on there but it gave only 1 seed word list when I first set it up.
From what I understand, you can restore your wallet onto another wallet, regardless of what kind of wallet it is. So if you have a ledger you can restore onto wasabi ect ect
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:47:22
Get a hardware wallet and use bisq
@_date: 2019-06-03 05:48:04
The next few years you'll see a lot of people coming out against bitcoin for whatever reason.
Personally, I'm not going to bother. I offer info when people seem interested but otherwise I just keep my head down and quietly live like a monk so I can put my paychecks into crypto. 
Don't waste time on these people - it's like arguing about uber with taxis or about the internet with librarians. :)
@_date: 2019-06-10 20:50:00
Its a lot easier to wrench attack someone for their bitcoin than for their bank holdings or real estate. :P
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:28:13
What are you gonna do with the money?
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:47:35
scaling is pretty on point right now for the rate of adoption we have.
The thing to watch for right now is the OTC supply - when that runs dry and everyone is forced to use exchanges we'll have some big price action and the news will follow. Crypto will become trendy for stores to accept. 
As far as getting salary, paying rent, and doing taxes in bitcoin, I'd say we've got 3-7 years to go... tech companies and big cities will definitely lead the way in that kinda stuff.
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:06:48
It'd be great to start with a history of money, particularly Nixon's ending of the gold standard and what problems that presents. Then move into how bitcoin is different and addresses those problems
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:44:26
I think every penny put in while bitcoin is less than 10-15k is a bargain.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:17:12
20k by sunrise at this rate... What happened??? Did the OTC supply run dry? This is crazy!
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:36:19


So much this. Once websites list their products' prices in satoshis and people learn they can't get a whole coin, they are going to freak out!
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:30:43
You only enter the info needed for each payment method.
So if you want to use money orders, you need your address.
If you use cash deposit, your routing/account numbers.
Its strictly p2p though - your info doesn't get stored on a central database. Its only available to people you trade with.
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:48:55
How do governments "essentially force sellers to use centraliesed exchanges.."?  
Its just as easy to use a decentralized exchange... what governments are shutting down decentralized exchanges?
@_date: 2019-06-14 01:31:27
this isn't very relevant to bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:57:26
BISQ is rad! It can be kind of cumbersome to buy or sell a large amount of fiat, but it's doable for my needs.
@_date: 2019-06-05 01:41:44
Adoption is pretty fast right now imo - didn't think we'd see a company like Whole Foods accept for awhile
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:52:39
Lets goooo!!!
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:45:10
It'd be much better split into columns of text. This is unreadable.
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:36:40
Its the weekend.
@_date: 2019-06-08 02:16:14
Download BISQ. I've used localbitcoins, coinbase, and bisq - its the best at least imo
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:51:18
Those are rookie numbers.... it'll quadruple at least
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:34:22
yep, I'm not even thinking of selling short of 250k. Probably will do some big trades at 280 but even then, no more than 30% of muh bags
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:25:05
This isn't that bad guys. This month has been insane!  
I see a lot of comments calling for 6-7k within the next few days but no one with any backing. This drop was the result of a huge long order sell off on one exchange - its not a trend. Its a reminder of how early you are to the market that whales still have this sort of influence.  
Dips on Mondays are nothing new.
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:29:16
IKR? Man. I start a new job next month and obsess over the price staying below 9k! Just lemme get 2 paychecks in!!
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:17:23
That'd definitely be optimal... I live pretty frugally right now and could get away with most of it being in BTC
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:32:38
\*SIGH\*.... zoom. out.
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:32:43
These places only have so much of it! OTC is for big buyers. They'll run out because there's a lot more people buying and holding than there are selling.  
They don't want to go to an exchange because they don't understand (or don't trust) and would rather invest through the same institution that handles all their stocks and real estate and such.  
More and more financial institutions are offering this - but there's only so much to go around.
@_date: 2019-06-06 03:21:32
very bullish.
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:17:09
The timing of previous bull/bear markets and trend lines on the logarithmic price scale. There's not an accurate way to factor in all this institutional action but that can only help. When OTC bitcoin runs out we'll see a price reflection for sure. OTC customers are paying as much as 11k per coin right now... that money turning to exchanges will blow the market up!
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:11:03

Move out of the city to somewhere I can live cheaply, put a stop to my dev career, and focus on music production full time :)
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:32:38
Or get in on the real hustle: rehabs.
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:02:00
An attacker can't pick it up and walk away, sure. They can force a victim to give it to them. That's the whole concept of a wrench attack.
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:00:43
Any amount of bitcoin priced less than $15k is a bargain.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:31:39
Oh look - another price prediction.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:14:48
I am so pumped for this dip!! Hopefully it lasts till next friday when the paycheck hits.
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:19:56
people get killed for far less every day... I remember back when I lived in NC someone just around the corner was killed over an argument of a sandwich and pack of smokes.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:13:13
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:20:33
a 4k bitcoin would make me so happy.
Also a 10k bitcoin would make me so happy.
@_date: 2019-06-03 01:37:33
It already is taxed - what I'm saying is that the current tax model doesn't really account for bitcoin becoming an everyday currency. The way it works now is you report your buys and sells and purchases (first in, first out - so you treat the first coin you bought as the first you sell).
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:57:23
What dump?

Gold has been a payment system for the majority of history ;3

Ask around and do research on hair transplants man - most people regret it. Eye surgery is a great idea tho.
I say invest every dollar possible while BTC is less than 15 or 20k, after that I'm switching to dollar averaging.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:35:28
ikr? Feels like I should meet up with local coinheads to celebrate
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:18:57
Have you been watching the volume?? I think there's a lot of manipulation going on right now. Crazy fluctuations in the billions of dollars in volume that jumps instantly
@_date: 2019-06-15 21:27:36
Mostly driven by sentiment changes as more people learn about the scarcity. People keep learning about all these massive OTC customers and can easily conclude what happens when OTC supply runs dry
@_date: 2019-06-06 02:41:24
While I'm hoping for a deeper drawback, I don't think its going to happen. We're trading sideways right now even with the volume dipping. Lots of bull flags. As usual, a great time to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:18:14
I think its also something most bitcoin users don't really gain interest in until they're deeper into crypto theory. 
Going through the 'extra steps' of a p2p platform doesn't make much sense when you just see bitcoin as a way to make some gains.
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:13:25
only cause hodlers google "bitcoin" every 15 minutes to check the price
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:57:11
This sub is confusing and sad.
The price has jumped 300% this year - and you're here calling for people to "not fuck around" and wait for a 25% run.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:34:56
Yes I'll buy from you 10k even  XD  
Seriously, if this kind of price action makes you think this way - you should get out now. The next year is going to be a tidal wave compared to today's move.
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:26:35
We're going to see this all the way through this market cycle - and it's why I prefer buying these dips instead of doing the weekly scheduled buy.  
I don't think we're going to last too long below 8k. Get it while its hot!
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:08:53
Market manipulation will get less effective as trade volume increases. IDK what tether is... I only have interest in bitcoin, litecoin, ether, and ripple.
@_date: 2019-06-03 00:13:30
That would be great - I think overall a lot less people know about BISQ tho. Maybe in time
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:42:35
True - OK I'll put up buy offers for the payment methods I have set up.
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:33:35
This is what I'm holding out for... the day I can buy a nice property with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:36:38
It can't be, not yet. The thing to keep in mind is that we're still in the VERY early adopter phases.
There's almost 4 active billion bank accounts worldwide, compare that to only 1 million active bitcoin addresses.
More use will mean more stability.
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:30:09
sold at 16, so that was the first bitcoin trade I've lost money on. Back in now tho - more steadily though. Also doing some hotel/airline stocks which make WAY more sense than bitcoin prices 
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:39:35
I blew all my paycheck on a fucking standing desk and rent or else I'd be dumping everything in - sub 10k AND all this news from the FED?? Make no mistake, this is an amazing day to buy a bunch of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-27 11:09:04
Finally- some good fucking memes

Seattle is a great city - maybe a solid place for a west coast citadel?
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:23:06
Yeah that's pretty weird... imagine listening to songs about paypal or index funds - that's how most people will think about it.

seeing growth after that big jump... just might see 9k before the holiday!
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:07:29
Yeh, hopefully I can buy back at less than 100k... who knows tho, with all the institutional money staged to enter the market maybe this run will end up differently :/
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:58:37
I'm selling off at least 50% at 250-300.
@_date: 2019-05-24 04:21:56
Great point. Its impossible to be ready for everything. I think staying aware and solid cardio (run away!) are way more important than guns/martial arts for keeping yourself safe.
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:08:18
Thanks for posting this. Its the final push I needed to get everything off of coinbase.
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:26:26
E Z hodl.
We'll see the real test at 50-100k :)
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:55:13
Yeah - I'd bet less than 1% of millennials have at least a full coin... meanwhile a small interest from a big investor can mean they buy thousands of coins.

I think the biggest thing right now is just understanding it. Most of the time when bitcoin comes up I hear "I just don't understand what the point of it is" or something to that effect.
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:05:28
Coinbase is super E Z
bisq is more aligned with the ideas behind bitcoin, its p2p
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:47:07
Wow. Great video

The next 400 days or so are going to be an absolute bloodbath.
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:40:13
A lot of people share the idea that we'll top around 300. Its hard to say with all the institutional money coming in soon... This bull run really will be different I think
@_date: 2019-05-28 00:23:49
Its members like you that really drive the point home.
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:09:01
I don't have very much money in general, but still try to stick to this - My checking account rarely stays over $200 unless I'm planning a bigger purchase :)

Fiat is slowly strangling itself. Before bitcoin, we never had a scale for how quickly it was happening.
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:04:19
Always nice to hear some insight into another place, thanks for sharing
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:51:39
What do you think putting a giant ad on a rocket would cost? Sponsoring a nascar costs tens of millions!
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:02:09
By then the idea of trading bitcoin for fiat will be silly, it probably won't be a very common thing.
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:00:32
I don't think bitcoin needs promotion.
@_date: 2019-05-25 04:07:03
I'll be surprised if we see a straight 24 hours above 8k before june... What's happening? Everyone who bought at 4k selling off??
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:40:00
its spanish for "foot" :)
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:17:21
Hm... I've used LocalBitcoins, Bisq, coinbase, and Ledger - they all feel very polished and not sketchy at all. 
Bisq is awesome. Works great. Looks great. I used localbitcoins before that and, aside from trading with people in other countries, never thought it was sketchy at all.  
Try those!
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:52:55
That's a paradigm shift that I had during my first year... I went from "use bitcoin to get more fiat" to "use fiat to get more bitcoin"  
I get excited to check the price because it means more opportunities to get more bitcoin. Where it used to be getting excited thinking about "cashing out" to fiat
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:32:45
Its no more dangerous but its more vulnerable than keeping money in a bank.

Yeah - I see so many posts on and whatnot about money... why is this any of your girlfriend's/husband's/wife's/boyfriend's business? I guess everyone does things differently but it seems to cause a lot of issues

Nice man. Hey another good idea for income property that I've considered is a storage facility. Depending on the location and zoning, they can earn a lot more per square foot/lot size. Something to think about, wouldn't be hard to be owner if you don't let yourself fall into the "manager" role!
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:08:34
You're not alone! Seeing bitcoin plummet to $7 wouldn't mean a thing. I'd buy more aggressively than ever.  
Great post btw
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:38:02
Bullish if true
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:28:02
no problems yet but this just made me realize its one more thing that can go wrong with keeping your stuff on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-29 00:05:25
Its really the same strategy, just a new perspective  
I'm not using my holdings until I can trade for a nice multi family income property. Like a 12-20+ unit apartment building type deal.   
I say that now but who knows how I'll feel when that time actually comes - I think it will come though!
@_date: 2019-05-28 00:28:20
go download bisq. This isn't the market in runescape :P
