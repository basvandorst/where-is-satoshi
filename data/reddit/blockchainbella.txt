He says that bitcoin and stocks are going to crash in the new year. But they are fundamentally different. He seems to think crypto is only traded in America by Americans. For stocks in America this is true. Obviously anyone can invest in them however the majority of investors in the NASDAQ are Americans. Not the same with bitcoin. Crypto is bought on exchanges globally and American investors only make up a portion of the market cap. And can we also say that the entire market cap for all cryptos is, in my opinion, quote small in comparison to other currencies or stocks.

Yeah besides futures don't work like that.  Someone who shorts it does hope it drops but 30 days from now if they have a one month short. So what they really want is for it to continue to soar and then a few hours or days before their contracts ends they want a strong dip so that it falls below the contract price they initially purchased at. For example 18k currently then up to $24k and then down to $15k when they go to collect so that they can use the short to buy more bitcoin at a lower price after selling theirs at $24k 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:39:59
Yeah it's not a bad thing to cash out and buy more on the dips. There will inevitably be dips for you to purchase. I also swap trade sometimes too. You have to do that from time to time. But for some of my bitcoin I just HODL but some I sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:53:13
Good  I'll buy more 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:14:48
Yes the reason is insider trading but that is photoshopped 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:22:26
They're not being traded on gdax but if you look at Coinbase BCH must be because it's going up and down in price (with a clear upward trend). Who are the people increasing the price? Definitely not you or me or the masses who want to sell. It's insiders. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:50:29
Ha. Let's just face reality BCH isn't scalable in the long run and will have the same issue bitcoin is facing and the central banks are treating bitcoin as an asset comparable to gold which means very few transactions need to be done and time is not of the essence. Also when I do the transactions don't cost me that much. Today is an exception just as it was several months ago when the whole BCH vs. BTC ordeal happened (which was clear manipulation on BCHs part and will happen again today). Anyway BCH doesn't solve the problem and there are already Blockchain's been with little to no fees and faster transaction times than BCH. Also if you understand merkle trees it's easy to see why the lightning network would be scalable and more efficient in the payment regard as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:56:01
That's all well and good but BCH trading is currently happening on Coinbase and GDAX and Coinbase aren't allowing the average person to buy or sell BCH thus those who have access to it are able to manipulate the price and inflate it and get out before the masses can sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:35:57
Well those that short would, theoretically, hold a lot of bitcoin and would sell along with others who also are whales to encourage retail investors to also short. It's like a domino effect. I'm not saying it will 100% happen more than likely bitcoin's price will drop based on discouraging news or serious regulation but that's at least one plausible theory that could encourage the price to fall significantly and whales can do it at a time when they know bad news is on the horizon. It's not legal but to think inside trading isn't happening is a foolish assumption. If I own $1B bitcoin and I sell $20M and so do all of my friends it will significantly drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:19:00
Aka we are going to let certain people have access to buying BCH at this inflated price and some selling to go on for our friends but once all of that is done then we will allow the average person to buy or sell their BCH which you most likely will sell because you got it for free and want to liquidate it to buy more BTC. Also we will shut down at some random time because of "server issues" which really means we won't have enough buyers for all the selling so we will wait for there to be more buyers and then rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:19:54
They're preventing it though. They're trying to increase the price so there will be more people that will want to buy before it descends on the masses. Because remember you need buyers for sellers. And before they hid the price walls it was well over 12k units trying to sell and only 75 units trying to buy! It's beyond scammy. Trading has halted and yet some people DO have access to BCH because it's actively being traded on Coinbase it's just that the average joe doesn't have access to it. Only those who Coinbase wants to have access aka whales and insiders. And go on GdAX none of the trades are showing and of course the average person can't trade on there. All of these people with access will be able to buy up the shitcoin and then dump when it ascends on the masses. Trust me this is going to be a mess and it's so clearly insider trading because it's literally happening in real time right in front of our eyes! 
Oh and another thing. If GDAX really wasn't tying to manipulate anything they would have given us our BCH but not allowed trading of it. So you'd have to move it to bittrex or something like that and sell it there but that would up the transaction times a lot which makes BCH look bad (ver would flip) oh and let's not forget the main reason Coinbase wants the BCH exchange... all the fees they will collect when people are finally able to sell. It's blatant exchange manipulation and yet nothing will be done to squash it! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:31
Just look at the sell walls on Coinbase and chill.  You're fine. Bitcoin is bitcoin and bitcoin cash is a forked version that will be worth something but nothing like bitcoin. Institutional money and smart money is flowing into bitcoin not BCH because BCH isn't seen as an asset. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:57:39
They're still doing it. You can't buy BCH or sell BCH on Coinbase or GdAx yet, in real time, you can see BCH being bought and sold. Who are these people buying and selling? Whales that have access to it before us! You know that's what's going on or else we would all be able to sell our BCH for more BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:46
You can do it on GDAX once the exchange is finally open. You can swap trade BCH for BTC it's one of the options they have 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:57
I agree. But regulation is coming. I just move my bitcoin  to my ledger. I don't think Coinbase will destroy bitcoins price in the interim. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:35:23
Really? Is BCH the best blockchain for transaction fees and block size out there right now? Is it the most scalable option?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:25:25
Need look no further than your own Coinbase account. Trading has halted and yet the price of BCH is going up? How is that possible? Especially when the sell wall was at 12k units and the buy wall was at 80 units. Clearly everyone wants to sell but they halted trading except for the few who have access currently and are increasing the price to prepare for the massive sell off which will occur. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:31
Pretty much. If you see bitcoin as a payment system than bitcoin cash is also obsolete there are far better Blockchains for payment transaction than either. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:02:19
Yeah. Look right now on Coinbase BCH is going up and yet no one else has access to buying or selling BCH. So who are these people that are buying up BCH on Coinbase not to mention GDAX (which is where more sophisticated traders trade) isn't even showing the trades. This is beyond shady. The only people who have access to coinbase's BCH right now are insiders who are in to drive the price up before dumping it before the masses can get to it. And it's happening right before our eyes! Unbelievable corrupt! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:03
Yeah I agree. I went to sell the bitcoin that day trade and it crashed right as I pressed "sell" on GDAX how sketchy is that.  And it's still down for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:40:31
But I don't think it can work that way once the exchange has gone live (which it did last night). And what exchanges specifically? If they themselves are an exchange then wouldn't the price be dictated by those buying and selling on the exchange? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:11
Yeah I think it's triggered by those that have bought and sold since I do some day trade they stop you from selling so that other accounts that do more business with gdax can sell of do as they wish but right now I have no idea what my money is doing as I pressed sell and then boom it crashes. How suspicious and yet some can still trade. Super sketchy and very illegal. This is the second time I've noticed this. They did this when the price dropped significantly from $11k down to $9k. It always seems to happen when it drops BUT never when it's going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:28:10
BCH is a forked version of bitcoin that has a larger block size and lower transaction fees but doesn't accomplish anything that the lightning network could fix and isn't a great blockchain in comparison to numerous others. If it was called anything other than BCH and wasn't forked from bitcoin, it wouldn't be worth very much at all. Maybe $200M market cap 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:28:10
They won't short it to 0 then they would have nothing left to short. It def won't be a one time thing plus many don't want to short it. They want to short it as they see it continue to go up. For example 16k down to 8k then back up to 20k then down to 10k then up to 25k then down to 15k etc... Not to mention shorting itself doesn't guarantee a crash or a correction. It just puts pressure on the market to do that and it allows big money to sell some of their bitcoin to whip retail investors into a frenzy to sell their bitcoin to drop the price. I'm just going to let whatever happens happen and buy at the dips. I used to sell at the highs but it was too hard to gauge exactly when so I stopped and started just buying more whenever I felt it was within a good buy setup.

The dump of bitcoin or bitcoin cash? I'm not understanding. Because BCH is being halted and yet others are able to trade it (aka buy it to inflate the price) on Coinbase and GDAX so you know the ones who have access to trading it are pumping up the price (and some are selling to prepare for the huge crash that will happen with BCH) before they allow those who received free BCH to sell it and buy more BTC with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:55:29
The dot com craze was mainly funded by Americans in the 90s into early 2000s and people are always saying bitcoin is a bubble and they say "looks at bitcoins price" so I always tell them that. It puts things in perspective. This whole cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy. It's only one quarter of what the market cap was for all dot coms before the dot com bubble burst and that was really only traded in the USA. Now our dollar isn't worth as much AND this is traded globally aka we have a loooong way to go 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:43:55

@_date: 2017-11-27 01:00:12
Oh I don't think that will happen. Honestly at this level that would scare me. I'd prob sell long before it dropped by 80%. And buy back in when I felt secure. But 20-30% is what I consider a healthy correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:18:23
Are you speaking about bitcoin specifically? Bitcoin works on a proof of work algorithm that can't just be cut in half. There are a finite supply of bitcoin (21 million) with a specific block size already configured. What is a better option, which they're working on, is called the lightning network which would put transactions into the block size in large groups from a blockchain running parallel to the bitcoin blockchain so it can be scalable. So a ton of transactions would be grouped together and then put as one transaction onto bitcoins blockchain. Sorry if this is confusing. It can be difficult to understand the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:13:00
You can meet up with someone who will sell you bitcoin on a paper wallet and pay them in cash or have them send bitcoin to your wallet. But obviously that takes a level of trust as well. I'm sure there are other ways but I just do what I have to and when taxman comes to collect I'm not going to try and avoid it. It's just like with stocks... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:56:44
I wouldn't even call it a correction. A minor pullback... a correction will most likely bring it down to 5-7k 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:34:30
I'm not sure to be honest. On most exchanges you must be over 18 the reason for this is because bitcoin and other cryptos are being seen as assets. Essentially that means they are the same as investing in Amazon or Apple or gold etc.. and you have to be 18 to do that and to file taxes for that. If you have an older sibling or perhaps a parent that would be interested I would go through them. I convinced my parents to invest in bitcoin with their spare cash and they're happy they did so I'd perhaps start there. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:46:50
Yeah. There are always going to be a lot of things we won't know. But I know that betting against BTC, in the long run, will always bite you in the ass. But I use the wisdom to my benefit. Buy BCH low and trade high for more BTC ����
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:41:54
Hm... I just checked on GDAX though and it's available in the U.K.  Not sure why you're having trouble. I don't think you can do margin trading on it (I can't in NewYork) but I think you can buy and sell. All you have to do is transfer your USD (or pounds) from Coinbase onto the GDAX exchange and then purchase bitcoin there. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:40:00
Yeah is this just manipulation from the BCH crowd since they got both during the fork? What I think is it's a way to make BCH the "new" "it" coin to drive bitcoin cores price down to get people to buy BCH high and sell bitcoin low. So that these whales can come back in and buy Bitcoin low and sell BCH high. Don't give into the hype. I'm resisting but it's an emotional rollercoaster 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:52:25
If you mean your wallet on Coinbase then no you shouldn't have been charged a fee. It's free to send money and crypto between Coinbase and gdax. But to move to your own private wallet where you own the keys, yes, you are charged a fee. Every time I move stuff to my hardware wallet I'm charged a fee. Usually around 0.001 BTC (for BTC) obviously different amounts for lite and ether so I move large amounts so that it doesn't cost me too much. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:40:31
Well that makes up some and the mentality is HODL buuuuut there is always a correction eventually if you look back through bitcoin's history. There 100% will be a correction. I've already been through a few. Buy on the dips :) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:07:27
And if you mean buying direct versus buying another way, I don't think it's possible for an investor in the U.K. Or USA to invest any other way safely. At least not right now. I'd go with Coinbase. They're a user friendly way to start buying bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:00:06
Considering that it has risen 10x in a year there is a good chance this time next year it will have risen substantially more than 2x your investment. But it is, nonetheless, a risky investment. If you're ok with the risk it may be worth it to invest. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:42:07
Well of course it will be taxable but in a what way I'm not sure. Depends how each token is seen and how regulators decide to define the market 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:56:31
Said what at $3k? That there would be a correction? There def was. There was the Jamie Dimon/China correction that saw a strong pullback and then the recent BCH vs BTC pullback. There will def be another. I'd predict a pullback to $7-$8k but sure it could happen at $11k and only pullback to $9.5K. The truth is no one knows when and exactly how much it will. It could also pull back to $5k. I'd personally buy on the dips. So I've just been HODL. Last time I bought was during the BCH/BTC dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:30:31
Welcome. Honestly though there will be another pump and dump of BCH. Could have just held onto it at this point. You made a rookie move. Don't worry we all have. I remember back in sept when china banned ICOs and Jamie Dimon said a bunch of stuff, I got scared and pulled out a little at a loss. Stupid move. I learned my lesson. We all have to. Welcome to BTC life :) 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:01:20
You shouldn't really be "buying" on Coinbase. They charge outrageous fees (premiums) for the convienenc of using the app. Use GDAX that's their actual exchange. You won't have to pay the insane fees and you're already in their system if you have a Coinbase account. Just buy in gdax and then transfer back to your Coinbase wallet. It's pretty simple and easy to use. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:45:38
Yeah I thought about this too. I'm not sure. But it seems plausible. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:52:53
Have your parents invest at the next dip if you want to get involved. If you have an allowance or something ask if you can out 10% toward bitcoin on Coinbase that way you can learn more about the space and also have a little investment in it as well :) 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:41:41
Yes. So you said you have a Coinbase account. What you want to do is put cash in your Coinbase account from your bank account or a credit card if you haven't already then send that over to GDAX and then buy bitcoin there so that you don't have to pay the high fees on the USD/Bitcoin exchange.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:56:30
It's certainly acting like it. Whales are out to play today. Also getting the feeling some institutional money is getting into the mix.

Yeah. Perhaps the way transfers are saved onto a blockchain for your crypto charges and conversion to fiat to pay for things... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:01:38
You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin. You don't have to buy an entire bitcoin. It's a currency. Another option would be litecoin if the idea of owning an entire coin versus a fraction is appealing. Although that, too, you can buy a fraction of. 
There may be index funds in the future. Those you could invest in. And I also heard there is a token coming out that is an index fund token. So you can invest in that and the token itself is invested in a number of the top cryptos. Forgot the name of that token but I know it's coming up.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:46:06
Haha. Ah I'm in there with you in the Vertcoin camp. Bought around $5 too. It's not plummeting and may go up to $6 in the coming weeks now that litecoin is getting more buzz. Oh and let me add TenX to the list. Bought at $2 :-/ 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:11:59
I'll take it. Fair assessment. You're right manipulating a 150B currency is no easy feat. Do you work in finance? I feel like bitcoin is one of the most polarizing discussions you can have.  I try to look at any crypto from every angle to make a fair assessment. Definitely not easy as I have a personal bias but it's important to know when to hold and when to fold. And my friends that work for VC firms and Hedge funds are all over the place when it comes to BTC. Some say "to the moon" while others scream "bubble". It's just an insane dynamic. There's something so exciting and yet so scary about this type of investment and it makes it so appealing to me!

Welcome to the club! ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:47:40
Yeah leaving your coins on an exchange isn't the best idea but everyone does sometimes so that it's easier to trade. If for some reason Coinbase (GDAX) or other exchanges were to get hacked the hackers would have access to the private keys since you don't own your own private key unlike a hardware wallet where you do. So far Coinbase hasn't had any issues and stores roughly 98% of the coins purchased offline but if something happens you're screwed because their insurance only covers the 2% that is online. Just think about MtGox...
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:49:33
Haha! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:04:49
It's a currency. Buy what you can afford. $200 now will be a lot later so long as you believe in bitcoin. If you're looking to make a million quick you're SOL. Also people always think in terms of one bitcoin. You should think in terms of satoshi. One hundred million satoshis equals one bitcoin. So why don't you say something like "I own 5 million satoshis" one day one satoshi might actually be worth $.01 that would be incredible but it's not completely insane to say anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:39:36
Yes you learned your lesson. Honestly at this point I would just hold. There could be another pump and dump. Just set a limit to sell and sell then during the pump. There's a good chance that it will happen again for BCH. Theres usually more than one pump. But yeah this weekend when so many people were just hopping on the BCH bandwagon I was shaking my head. I knew that gravy train wasn't going to last forever. Soon you'll see that when you pivot something against bitcoin you should stick with bitcoin. Although I did do a trade this weekend. When bitcoin was dropping (the morning of the pump) I traded half my BTC for BCH and then when it skyrocketed above $2000 and BTC was below $6000 I traded it back for BTC. It takes time to figure these things out. But eventually you'll figure out the right strategy. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:44:00
True. But BTC will dip at some point and I don't think ver is done yet. But that is just my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:08:16
Smart move 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:12:21
Buy at what you perceive to be dips and HODL. Best advice you're going to find if you think it will go up a lot more than this. If you're one to give into FUD or FOMO you'll inevitably end up buying high and selling low. Be consistent in your approach and what you truly believe and go with that. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:00:28
I'm not sure. And you also don't want to do this without them knowing. They'll have to pay taxes on any gains and if they don't know it could mess with their taxes. If your parents aren't ok with the investment I wouldn't do it at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:41:42
You know he sold it back to BTC just before the dump. He's not an idiot. He did it to grab the newbies

Haha it's true. Sometimes I feel like I'm evangelizing people when I speak about crypto. I don't mean to but the tech excites me. It's the first time we've had a technology that could potentially revolutionize and decentralize the way we ah!!! I'm doing it again! Please disregard this comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:04:53
Yeah. And you don't necessarily have to think about it in terms of "bitcoin". If the price continues to increase and one day bitcoin is worth, let's say, $100k people will probably speak less in bitcoin and more in Satoshis. People will say "I own 20 million satoshis rather than 0.2 bitcoin". Just another way to wrap your head around it.

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:08:07
True. But I think you're thinking in dollars and cents. In the future if bitcoin was to ever be a payment platform I think people would start using satoshi. Buying a coffee would be 800k satoshi instead of saying 0.0008 bitcoin. It's just a thought. Who knows? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:47:19
Could be either of the two IMO. I was watching that. I'm just enjoying the ride. I rarely sell. Although I did trade half of my BTC for BCH this weekend and was rewarded handsomely when I swapped it back for BTC. Probably one of the top trades I've done. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:50:35
Typically there's a fee associated with buying bitcoin so it wouldn't be advantageous for you to do that over and over again unless you're buying something expensive with bitcoin at a time when bitcoin is potentially going to dip. For example if I bought a car at bitcoins height. Then waited for that dip and then bought back in. Right now it's def more so a store of value rather than a payment platform. Once there's leveling and less volatility I'm sure we'll see that. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:50:48
Sir? I'm a lady! It's not all boys in the crypto-space ;) but yeah HODL is my motto but every now and then have to manage the risk and take a chance. I foolishly did sell my BCH when I got my hands on it over the summer for $550 :-( who knew? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:36:41
I don't know about that. If bitcoin hits $10k it puts more pressure on people to HODL and see it as an asset. Way too volatile to spend. When it levels off and isn't as exciting anymore that's when it can be seen as a payment platform AND when it's utilizing the lightning network or some form of scaling and efficient transaction technology. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:55:44
I've never heard it explained that way but yes you're right if one "piece" is 1/100 of bitcoin then it would be 1 million satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:05:53
Not sure if I'm understanding this correctly... but It's a percentage. It's like investing $11k in Amazon or Apple. You'll receive the percentage it goes up or down on your investment. But you don't have to invest $11k but obviously if it goes up you won't receive as much because you invested less so you own less bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:42:54
Hah yes that is very true. That's when I was switching my Bcash for more BTC (5800). Well hopefully it's a rookie mistake and they will learn from it. We all grow! And BTW BTC is almost at 7900! :-)

Then transfer USD to gdax purchase bitcoin or ether or lite in gdax (so you don't get the fees) and then move it back to your Coinbase wallet and then safely onto another wallet or keep on Coinbase if you want to sell on gdax again soon

What? Haha it was def one of the cypherpunks. You sound like one of those pizza-gate people.

Yeah but one article that I think really puts it in perspective is [this dot com bubble article from 2000](  the dot com bubble burst and lost 1.7 trillion in market cap. People scream "another dot com bubble" right away  without actually looking at the true numbers. The dot com really only hurt the American market (Nasdaq)  and it was a 1.7T market collapse in 2000. Bitcoin, and cryptos in general, are barely a blip in comparison right now. They're so quick to say it's the next dot com but even if that is so it's sooooo far away from that and it's on a global scale not just the USA because a la the internet which changes the fundamental way this market is being driven.

That's tough. If you're under 18 i honestly recommend you discuss with someone who is over 18 and have them invest on your behalf. Although it sounds like you're from the U.K. They may have diff laws. You may not need to be over 18 to invest on Coinbase. In the US and Canada you have to.

Potentially. Crypto is an ever-evolving market. Also it could potentially become both. I mean I save my money but I also spend it. With the lightning network and when bitcoins's price isn't so volatile it could become a form of payment and an asset. Right now it's too volatile and it goes up too much. Imagine buying a coffee with bitcoin in 2013 that coffee today would have cost you $150.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:55:29
Yeah that does make sense. Better to let it continue to rise and short on an inevitable dip since BTC has quite a bit of those. So, for the time being, are you saying best to HODL through the futures market opening by the CME? I've been on the fence since this has been such a bullish week for ether and bitcoin. Don't know if I should take some profit or keep HODL 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:23:53
Yes Coinbase is a great place to start and where many of us started buying bitcoin. However you have to be over 18 and you should have a credit card or bank account to link to it. £10 is fine. You should invest what you can afford to lose and also can invest in diff cryptos as Coinbase allows you to buy into bitcoin, ether and litecoin. :) 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:06:21
Everyone acts like they know. The truth is no matter how you look at bitcoin no one knows EXACTLY what will happen unless you somehow have insider info. There will be a pullback for sure. Could be tomorrow could be a month from now. Could be when it hits 9500 could be when it hits 11500. Who knows?
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:47:14
You have to remember that to the average person bitcoin is still a confusing, dirty and scary investment. When I mention that I invest in bitcoin most people either don't know what it is or associate it with criminals. I'm just now getting my parents to hop on the bitcoin bandwagon and that took convincing. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:52:16
It was one of the first exchanges available for people to buy and sell crypto mostly bitcoin but then they were hacked and lost all of the bitcoin that was stored on their exchange. People lost millions. Scary stuff. Definitely read about it if you can. If you have Netflix check out the documentary "banking on bitcoin" they go into great detail about it all.

Haha no worries!! I know. This is def still a male dominated space. But it's changing. I actually went to a Women in Blockchain meet up in my city (New York). And yesssss!!! I'm watching it. Hell im even happy it got to 7900 today. Now I want the pullback so I can buy more! Where's my martini? ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:46:17
Don't sell. Trade for another coin to hedge the risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:44:59
Miners will still benefits from putting transactions on the block. Also I'm sure by 2170 (or whenever it's supposed to be fully mined but I know it's some time in 2100) they will have figured out a way to entice miners to continue to work....If bitcoin is still a thing by then. And if it is...My god! I'll 100% be a millionaire and also be dead lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:45:40
Hm strange. It's free for me to move my gdax purchase to my Coinbase wallet. Also another great thing is you can buy ether with bit or bit with ether. Trading is sometimes cheaper than buying with USD. Better exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:12:26
I'd like to think it's just when you move to cash. Right now bitcoin is the only "currency" that the US government is looking at classifying however I'm sure the others will follow suit. Right now they see it as an asset not a currency. That means that trading between assets may not count as taxable until you cash out. BUUUT if it's a currency as a payment system then ��‍♀️...
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:58:31
I use bittrex. There are some others but I find them to be the safest way. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:53:56
Yeah but that option costs an arm and a leg. Ironically when I first joined Coinbase I tried to buy $100 with my CC and it was rejected so I then used my account which worked fine. I'd wait for a dip before buying with a CC but good chance your CC won't allow the transaction.

Pretty sophisticated jail then

Bitcoin is broken down into 100Million satoshis. Exchanges set a minimum amount of satoshis you can purchase but theoretically you can purchase 1 satoshi. .00000001 is the smallest denomination of bitcoin.  Of course most exchanges have a minimum of $10 or so. That would get you roughly 85k satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:45:41
That is heartbreaking for me to read. One of my biggest fears. I literally quadruple check when I send to my wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:39:34
I'm not against Coinbase. You just have to pay high fees in comparison to GDAX. I honestly only buy on GDAX but I live in America. You can buy another currency with fiat on bittrex and then trade that in for bitcoin. That's my only other thought but others might have better suggestions for you.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:51:42
I'm not sure. I really hope that changes. I'm a woman in blockchain tech and also in cryptocurrency investment. I am fascinated by and really love blockchain technology. I think things are slowly changing. I actually just went to a meet up for women in the blockchain sphere and there were well over 100 women there. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:02:33
Look at CME welcoming Bitcoin in as an asset. That's what it is for the time being. I, too, think about that a lot "what is the intended purpose and what has it become?"  The silly rumors of Amazon allowing payment in bitcoin make no sense with the current trend. I mean you wouldn't pay for a shirt in bitcoin if that shirt could potentially have cost you 10x its value down the road. Bitcoin is volatile right now so people either hold or sell. Bitcoin could become an asset like gold. It's secure enough and can store value. Whether it will become that in some form, I don't know.... I don't think anyone can give you a clear answer right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:49:14
They couldn't directly hack into your wallet just by inowing your public key as your private key is not known. But if they can figure out who you are they could try to get into where ever you're storing your coins.

You'll regret that when the burger cost you $50 ;) but... that does look like a tasty burger

They allow you to spend crypto on actual things. Not a bad idea for some people 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:18:15
There will be a correction or, at the very least, a pullback. Those of us who have been in this for a bit of time are used to pullbacks and corrections around the 20-30% range but bitcoin has a history of 50% price corrections and with the futures market coming there's good reason to suspect a number of people will be shorting it. I think in  the next few weeks we will see a pullback.
