OP fucking delivers.
Good app, solid UI design, logo is awesome. Looks like you put some solid UXD into it, nice work.

80% price drop from ATH would be about right.

If we're talking about the CFTC investigation, the only current investigation into market manipulation that I'm tracking, the that's not what the investigation is about at all:

That's not a thing.  
Firstly the actual cost to mine is highly variable. 
Secondly the cost of mining isn't going to somehow magically just hold the price up. If it falls below a profitable level miners will either switch to another crypto, or be forced to mine at a loss. If they do the latter and btc stays low for an extended period likely miners will start going out of business, in either case the net effect is that miners leave btc thus lowering difficulty and thus lowering cost. I have no idea why but this seems to be a hard concept for people to understand.

Dead. MySpace is fucking dead.  
And I'm also pretty sure it was never a publicly listed company, so you couldn't trade it unlike bitcoin. 
As bitcoin is an asset, and like any other assest it can be traded, it subject to speculation. And because bitcoin has zero physical value other than what we give it by speculation, if anything it is more susceptible to market dynamics.
Edit : it occurs to me now that you may have been being sarcastic.

That's not even close to what the market manipulation investigation is actually about.

"People trade to make a profit not to fit some pretty chart pattern. Stop looking at charts. It only shows what the price was IN THE PAST. It says nothing about the future."
No, I'm pretty sure that's exactly what you said, even if it might not be what you meant.

Bullshit. Any expert that says they know where price is going is full of shit.  
Someone making an informed projection is at least trying to understand the market and reason why it will go in that direction, even if they're wrong it can still provide valuable information to those willing to critically analyse their work.

You're basically saying traders don't use charts, and chart patterns to trade. You're wrong.

I don't buy that at all. It's a lack of liquidity and fomo buying/selling. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:36:47
But is it good for botcoin??

I really want bitcoin to be 1mil by 2021, but I also want John McAfee to eat his own dick.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:50:32
Hopefully, I'll buy more then.

Learn to TA. Google Head and Shoulders pattern. Look at daily chart.
It's probably not moon though, you're right about that. Downward trend still likely to continue.
