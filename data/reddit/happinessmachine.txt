Yes, perfect laissez-faire capitalism, just like you can find in Somalia

Lightning newbie here, at what point will exchanges start using lightning? You would think lower network fees and faster times would mean more trading and hence more trading fees for them, right?

Boomers were putting their pensions into crypto, they will lose their money then scream for the SEC to step in and regulate shit.   The SEC is probably looking at Roger's insider trading tweets as a challenge and will be out for blood.

Love all of you guys.  Crypto enthusiasts are the best people on the internet IMO.  We are making the world a better place regardless of prices, futures, and other nonsense.

For more information on the central banking system, fractional reserve lending, etc and why it's all bad news check out the documentary ["The Money Masters" on youtube.](

holy smokes I've never thought of it like that.... the Fed is probably sweating right now as wall street can now just step around their monetary policy like this....
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:20:38
Going on CNBC to spread FUD is an attack though...

Sweet, see ya next month.  Not even kidding.

If we has a Bernie bro he would have mindlessly handed it all to Bernard "No Refunds" Sanders.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:57:47
Yep, this is where we separate weak hands from strong hands.

Just cash some of my holdings out whenever I need dough.

You're welcome for that one.  But also know that whenever I panic sell any, the price immediately rebounds up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:31:00
Sorry your candidate lost buddy

THERE YOU HAVE IT FOLKS

Thanks for holding my bags homie, you're a braver man than I am.

Step 1: buy the dip
Step 2: HODL

Roger sticks his neck out like this, SEC is coming with their hedge trimmer to snip that pompous head off.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:56:01
Because they want you to panic so they can pick up your coins on the cheap.

Hey me too buddy!  12/29 is my last day.  Retiring at 31 sure feels weird, but I'm sure I'll keep busy doing something.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:39:26
In my job?  It's sales making 200-250k per year but almost 100% commissions and very time consuming/stressful.   Now my stress will likely transfer to crypto prices though..
Coin holdings are big enough that I never have to work again if I don't want to.  As long as the market doesn't tank faster than I can bail out.
Obviously I'm very optimistic otherwise I wouldn't be doing this.

When I send you bitcoin, I'm just sending a message saying "my address 123 sends 1 btc to your address 456"
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:21:10
This is bullish as fuck, especially since they are start with ONLY Bitcoin (the real bitcoin not the fake one).
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:16
14k in 3... 2...
@_date: 2018-08-24 04:47:02
I'd give it 2 years, not even kidding.

ICOs always were a scam to hoard btc.  Die shitcoins die, especially bch
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:39:36
We gonna see a massive head and shoulders formation here?
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:09:04
what would you recommend then?
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:48:38
Yes, and central banks are buying bitcoin.  If ya can't beat em, join em I guess..
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:18:47
Install Linux, I'd recommend Fedora:

Noob here.  Have they done or are they doing anything to mitigate attacks by malicious TOR exit nodes?  I remember hearing that was a major flaw
@_date: 2014-12-23 21:24:12
Ahh I wasn't aware of the automatic hidden service peers being added, that's good.  
I was referring to the concerns in the paper here: 
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:18:14
Instead of UPnP, did you try just opening the ports on your router?  If that still doens't work, maybe file a bug on their github page.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:18:22
Also, people's uncertainty/fear will leave them and we will go back to hyperspeedbullmode from last week.

All Pai is doing is returning regulation of ISPs to the FTC.  The FTC should be the governing body with this sort of thing.  We saw reddit spaz out earlier this year over ISP customer data sharing, and it turned out to be the right decision on the part of the FCC.

b-but the central banker on the TEE VEE said it was a scam!!!

When will people stop using trash banks like BOA and Chase and move to better options like Schwab?

I like the tech behind Storj, SingularDTV, Sia, Tezos, and Monero. I think they actually bring something new and really add value.

A peasant in the middle ages had more vacation time than the average American worker.   Why do you assume automation will reduce the workforce?
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:05:55
No, post-scarcity is a pipe dream that will never happen.

Wouldn't a VPN help here?  Given AT&amp;T's track record, every one of their users should have one.

I doubt it.  My job is helping educators bring technology into K-12 classrooms.  You'd be surprised how many kids have never seen a mouse (because tablets), and think that EVERYTHING is called an "app".
