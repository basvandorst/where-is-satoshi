sooooooo, why don't devs update it with something cool and good? Come on, guys, why are we so slow to change and evolve?
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:34:21
BTCisGod made a fair point there, but I've seen so much drama about devs that I don't even know if they started this as a way to change the word to better, or just to get rich quick. Even Mark Karpeles was on dev team, right?

Yes, that actually makes sense, but then shouldn't "we" have somewhere to post our ideas and vote for them what we want to see in next update?
The current situation is: "Let core devs do something, we will pray to god (Statoshi) that it is what we want, if it is not (which most likely won't be) we will just stop using it." This is how we get no work done, and besides, you cannot make changes that 100% of community will be for.

Thanks mate! That is really helpful!
@_date: 2014-10-12 11:50:26
so, does that mean everything that comes from smtp.com is most likely scam or spam?
@_date: 2014-12-15 09:17:03
It is highly unlikely that they will add it to Windows 10, BUT, if people would add Bitcoin wallet to "free" version of Windows, in their torrents, that would help much.

second, but I was wondering how could they use talk mail address?

huh, thanks for insight, it is really helpful to hear opinion from such profession.

Aaaaand it is on front page, and someone gilded this post... 
Awesome! -.-

I was thinking about Cryptsy, I already have an account there.

just want to have an response to my friends when they ask me how to get into it. I always tip them first, but I think making them pay for it has greater impact on people. For example I've given some people "redeem" codes of up to $20, and they never redeemed them to their wallet. But if they actually put into it their own money, they would appreciate it much more.

Bank takes too much for deposits, and takes more than a week to do it.

What's the point? The point is that when I talk to people and explain them good AND bad things of Bitcoin, most of them would like to try it out, but are not computer experts, nor would like to invest much money. 
So then I say that is not a problem, and I can deposit to their wallet whatever amount they want.
But what about people who don't have friends with Bitcoin willing to sell? Why couldn't everyone be able to buy whatever amount they want for whatever reason?
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:23:27
As I said to the person above, I've got couple of BTC that I've bought few years ago, so I don't need $10 of BTC, it's just I want to do a little test with 10 USD to see how convenient is it to buy small amounts of BTC. Also, I need it as argument when talking to my friends about Bitcoin :)
Nevertheless, I really appreciate your tip, if you don't cancel it by tomorrow, I will take it and tip someone who I think will get more into BTC when they get their first bits :)

Too expensive!

bitkonan? hmmmm, never heard of it. Anyone have any experience with them? are they legit?
In the meantime, I will do my google-FU
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:23:25
Actually, one of those posts inspired me to try it myself how to buy small amounts of btc easiest way. I am longish time hoDLer and I don't really need it, just want

I think exchanges should just help out catch the thieves by releasing their information when stolen coins are converted to fiat and withdrew.
@_date: 2015-03-15 23:46:49
No, not gonna collect it, as I stated, this is NOT why I asked this question. I just want to see what would be most convenient way to buy small amounts of BTC. I already have a couple of BTC that I bought 2 years ago. I've been following it since then.
Come on, look at my username, do you really think I am the person you should be giving BTC? I'm already in, go to some skeptic people and tip them to show how awesome Bitcoin is (at least that is what I am doing on Facebook and Twitter). I've tipped about $20 worth of BTC, and for about $30 left.
I appreciate your kindness though. :)
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:31:05
Thanks for offer, but I am more looking for general information, or where to point people who want to get into BTC, but don't wanna invest much.
@_date: 2015-03-15 14:52:25
hmmmm, paypal payments, this is actually good alternative. Thanks!

Hmmmm, didn't even know I could do that on localbitcoins! Thanks! I think this comment should be way up so more people could see it! :)
@_date: 2015-03-15 14:07:20
hmmm, will probably go with Bitstamp. Sadly, there are no faster ways :/
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:23:44
sadly, no :(

I have 1 ounce of weed, 3 friends at home, 1 whole pack of rolling papers, 2 days home alone, 10 Gb of chill music. Hmmm, lets see:
(1+3)*1^2 +sqrt(10^2 ) = 420.
Yes, definitely 420
