So what model is good enough? A currency that halved its value over a week?

I'm no redpill expert or even reader, but I am subscribed to it and occasionally catch some stuff on my front page. It is my understanding that AWALT is not a matter how many women are doing it or used to do it. Its more of a cautionary thing, they don't mean "all" or even a certain percentage. Its more Like how they say "every gun is loaded" basically they are saying dont put yourself in a position where women can take advantage of you, because some of them are very capable of it, which I think should apply to all genders anyways.

I remember when it was less than a cent. It wasn't even of value tbh, it was something people were just messing around with because it was interesting. All I remember back then was some random thing that had potential to be very valuable. At the time I thought the idea that it would ever be worth more than a dollar was really stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:55:49
Which bring me back to my original point. No legit business will accept it if it’s made illegal 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:51:52
But they make you high, bitcoins value comes in part it being exchangeable for real money  
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:17:50
What’s the difference? At least fiat has the backing of government and/or gold. Bitcoin will lose a lot of value if there is no demand for it. When it becomes illegal to cash or trade it, the demand will tank
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:29:10
The fed have a whole multi trillion dollar military to protect the value of their currency, bitcoins value is entirely demand based 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:20:26
Drugs have value because they make you high. bitcoin's value in part comes from you being able to trade it for real money. you take that away, it will take a hit
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:49:24
Government can make bitcoin trading illegal. When companies like coinbase go under and bitcoin is traded person to person like a drug, its value will drop
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:10:05
Yea but black market is always smaller than legit market 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:28:23
If being stupid means making a lot of money then yea I’m retarded 
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:43:19
You start conservatory and slowly increase as you become more confident in you abilities and knowledge base, you you really that stupid that you can’t understand such a simple concept? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:58:01
So far it has worked out for me pretty well and I’ve made a good amount of money of it. I’ve been following bitcoin closely since the time it was worth 12 cents and it’s gotten very easy for me to notice a boom/bust happening because it has happened so many times and they all looked the same 
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:41:40
Amen my dude, amen
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:37:46
I’ve been following bitcoin for a decade, the investment began only a little more than couple of years ago with very conservative amounts
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:42:01
Someone salty he didn’t invest in bitcoins years ago... 
you don’t need to insult my intelligence, I know what I’m doing and my bank account agrees. People are good  and knowledgeable at many things and I respect that, I’m good with bitcoin, I always sold before crashes and always bought at yearly lows. As a matter of fact I sold all my coins at 18.7k because I knew it would crash around 20k. Other than my first attempt at this years ago, I’ve never lost money from trading. And one things for sure, since day one I’ve been telling people yelling “bubble will burst tomorrow” into my ear to fuck right off, and made thousands. And to idiots saying you have no idea what the future holds, well you can say that about anything finance related. Now go back to the sideline and heckle someone else while making no money cuz you don’t have the balls to risk a cent 
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:27:19
I only invest when I see the signs of another boom coming. My ability to spot that from almost a decade of watching bitcoin closely is what has made me more than my actual salary. If every investor was to sit in the sideline and listen to people like you describing the way it could go wrong we would never have successful investors. Market has spoken and Bitcoin is here to stay and will likely experience another boom beyond 20k in a year or so (unless something special happens but I’ll be watching for that). All of investing is about taking the right risks, not dwelling on how it could go wrong. 
Also, I’m not sure what you mean by selling isn’t instantaneous. Off course it isn’t, that’s how market works, but when you have a sustained high trading volume you can almost always sell your coins at market price or a few cents less. if you take you coins out of the market, you can sell them in many other websites that deal with different forms of payment, some legally questionable. Cashing out coins has never been concern to me at all, and I’ve done it with no issues quite a few times now
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:44:57
I invest in peoples stupidity, that’s why I buy low when everything is calm and wait for the next bubble and craze (which consistently happens every year) and sell when it’s really high, rinse repeat 
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:54:16
So much salt I can taste it through the screen. Alright dude you’re right whatever you say, congrats on your first internet fight 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:21:06
Bitcoin was widely discussed on /b/ when that board was popular. That how I found out about it. Each bitcoin was 12 cents back then. A lot of hardcore tinfoil hat conspiracy theory threads basically told you to sell anything you don’t need and buy bitcoins. Christ i can’t believe how far we came.
@_date: 2016-10-19 01:14:47
What I don't get is that we have to be literally the only country that doesn't enforce immigration laws, and when we do we're racist somehow. Any other country you sneak in illegally they kick you out so fast your head will spin. I think there should be law and order. Personally I'd rather provide a path to citizenship for them while securing the border

Wut? They literally committed a crime, off course a company under jurisdiction of the US government would provide information for a legal subpoena
what you said sounds like a murderer complaining about government intruding on his serial killing by arresting him

Doing that is very hard actually (impossible almost), they confirm your phone number and identity and almost all VPN and socks are blacklisted. On top of paypal holding your money for 21 days unless you have a mature account (which is a pain in the ass that takes months-for only one cash out- to make and one tiny mistake puts you back in square one)
You're better off having cash mailed to you for for bitcoin. You lose like 15% and you can do like 5k max a month but more than enough to live on until you can find a professional to do the money laundry for you (which usually involves starting companies offshore and exploiting certain countries laws, etc.)

Are you trying to break this thing
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:18:06
Risk/reward is too high. "Matured" paypal accounts are very very expensive and the risk of it getting limited is quite high. The amount of time and works it takes to mature multiple paypal accounts is not worth it. 
Remeber, all those experienced hackers wouldn't sell their Matured paypal accounts for $800 if they knew they could get more money out of it
@_date: 2016-05-31 06:38:02
its easy to create a stealth account, but to have them release the money to you before shit goes south is the problem
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:10:42
By pinned do you mean storing bitcoins on it? Or just logged into something like coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:57:22
I'm so confused, most of what you described is already law. When I fly into US I have to declare all the cash and assets I'm bringing if it's over 10g and if I don't they'll take it all. How's is this law different than the existing one?
