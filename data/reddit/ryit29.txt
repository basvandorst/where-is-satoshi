I don't think you realize how much some of us get paid. There's only so much you can put into tax deferred accounts. Also, stock options are considered taxable income just like wages.

I think it's funny you think no one is in the top tax brackets. A doctor in California is most definitely paying a marginal tax rate of 50% (37% federal + 12.3% state). Ever heard of tax loss harvesting?

If you lose money on bitcoin, you can dedudct the loss off your taxes. Of course, this assumes you are properly reporting your cyrpto purchases to the IRS.

You edit your post after I've read it and expect me to know what you put in afterwards? That's your fault for thinking people are constantly refreshing to read your posts. How about you actually form complete thoughts before you hit save? I'll wait this time.

Bitcoin is literally an zero sum market. The only reason people are OK with losing 50% is because they can write it off their taxes. So their 50% loss is only 25% if they are in a high tax bracket.

You must be one of those people that think crypto market cap works the same way as market cap for equities.

Let me guess. No one got the question right.

I don't think you know how tax deductions work. If I lose $100 and I'm in a 50% marginal tax bracket (federal+state), then I save $50 on taxes. If you are only saving 15%, it is you who needs to hire an accountant. You are an idiot if you have capital loss offsetting long term capital gains. You don't have to be a day trader to lose money on crypto.

This will cause investors and speculators to pull out of crypto if you can't claim capital loss or gains IMHO

Have you seriously never heard of the Alternative Minimum Tax?

It sucks because you can't rebuy for 30 days or else it's a wash sale.

Are you done? If so, I'm not the one editing my posts and accusing the other person of "moving the goal posts."
