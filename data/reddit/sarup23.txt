@_date: 2018-09-24 16:27:15

Thankgod there is no face to bitcoin.
And i know now, why there isnt one.
  Also can anyone please explain it to me how would These decentrialized curriencies would be efficient on stopping the "all powerfuls" if they can go buy all they want of these curriencies.
Techinically they have all the money to buy em right??

@_date: 2019-06-17 17:18:34
Yeah, thats what i am looking into now.
I knew about some of the registration and licences but crypto has always been trickly when speaking about legality. So first step i have found would be to start from law firm.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:33:57
True, been there done that!
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:50:55

Its time to accumulate.
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:57:15

@_date: 2018-11-15 15:34:32
Yup, i am excited!
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:54:07
Thanks mate!
I am really happy to finally be a part of this club.
And this dip is making me happy.
Its a oppurtunity!
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:42:54
Yeah, this will only lead to getting rid of weaker hands so we can accumulate more.
Cheers mate! enjoy early christmas bargain!
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:45:01
Well. shit!
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:46:40
Tell me about it!
I have joined so many hype trains last couple of years only for that darkness to shape me to become a long hand stronger Hodler.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:52:35
Yeah wtf?
What is going on?
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:58:15
Wow, didnt know about that!
Maybe this will act as a kickstarter.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:02:36

@_date: 2019-09-24 23:04:17
