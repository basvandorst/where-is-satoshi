My time to shine.
Bitcoin itself is prior art against patents related to cryptocurrencies.  You can't patent something that already existed and was invented by someone else.
The U.S. Supreme Court's recent rulings in *Bilski v. Kappos* and *Alice v. CLS Bank* make it extremely difficult to patent software-implemented "business methods", which nearly anything related to Bitcoin would likely fall under.
Lastly, patents apply only within the country that granted them.  (Europe is moving toward an EU-wide system, so that may change.)  While large companies can be worth suing, it's not worth suing individuals for patent infringement.  So, while a British patent might be enforceable against a London company trying to offer a particular service, it wouldn't give a lawsuit right against a company offering the same service in Germany;  a U.S. patent wouldn't affect businesses operating in China.  The distributed nature of Bitcoin also impedes lawsuits, because who do you sue over a distributed operation that might take place anywhere on the planet?
tl;dr: No.

No prob.  That said, there are certain risks -- such as Microsoft's favorite old strategy of "embrace, extend, extinguish".  Embrace a new technology, extend it with trade-secret or patented changes, extinguish it by destroying its usefulness.
They tried it with Kerberos, where they added proprietary usages of certain message fields and then tried to claim trade-secret status so that only Microsoft's implementation could be used.  They also tried it with Java, where they rewrote certain Java libraries to be incompatible with what Sun Microsystems had produced.
Also, a company could push for its technology to be included in a BIP, and only after release announce that they had patented it.  One of the big memory-chip companies, Rambus, tried this with one of the memory standards;  IIRC they got spanked by the courts because they hadn't disclosed their patent applications to the technology consortium during the development of the standards.  However, that made it a long and expensive battle for everyone involved, and IIRC they did manage to force payment of license fees under FRAND standards.

From the quoted article:


Total system work done is O(nt) where n is number of full nodes and t is number of transactions. We can easily see this is true: each full node verifies every transaction in the Bitcoin system. Thus if we set 1 computational unit = 1 transaction verification, total units of work done is the multiple.
Assuming he's correct (I haven't dug through what's going on, so I don't know, but it sounds reasonable) and assuming I'm understanding his intended meaning, the *n* for the number of nodes should really drop out since all the nodes operate in parallel anyway.
If the work done per block really were to scale with the number of nodes, then it would be best to have only a single node running in the whole world, but that would be cray-cray.  Nobody would design a parallel system to slow down as nodes were added, because that would mean anyone could destroy the system by adding a bunch of nodes.

I could use some more explanation here.
What exactly is "the coin"?  AFAIK all there really is is an address with a value attached to it, and that value is transferable and dividable.  I can transfer multiple values to a single address and get a larger value.
There's no "coin" there.
If I transfer that value to another address, I pay a "mining fee" on the transaction.  The value gets divided up over time.  If I were to associate some "color" with that value, the "color" would end up spread all over the network as mining fees ate it.
Edit:  I read the link provided by So, my understanding is more or less correct -- has the problem of spending all your 100 shares of MSFT-on-the-blockchain for a pack of gum, or irretrievably mixing those shares with shares of Overstock-on-the-blockchain, been solved?  Byrne's totally separate blockchain seems like the way to go for any such assets, since the Overstock shares blockchain is then a completely separate entity from Bitcoin.  Sure, there is a central authority in such a situation, but if a company screws up its own blockchain, then the company bears the responsibility of straightening out the mess, too;  it's called accountability.

Assuming this is a Lamassu ATM, the steps are as follows:
1. generate a bitcoin public/private key pair
2. make a QR code from the PUBLIC key (begins with a 1)
3. print the QR code on a sheet of paper
4. go to the ATM
5. shove money into the ATM
6. hold up the QR code to the ATM's camera
7. wait a few minutes and then check that the transaction occurred
There are a few ways to generate bitcoin public/private key pairs.  I have used bitaddress, downloaded onto a small standalone computer that does not get hooked up to the internet.  The code is available on Github.  Verify that you have an honest copy;  there are edited copies floating around.
There are a bunch of QR code generator sites on the web.  I used  to generate code, and   to check that the generated image was correct and valid.
Obviously, test with a very small amount first before trusting that you have done things correctly and that the ATM works and that the ATM operator is honest.

Ah, I see, it's crowdsourcing the answers.  I suppose it could be considered a form of binding arbitration, then, which is legal as long as both parties agree to it in the contract.  Still wouldn't replace all the other legal stuff, which is probably 90% or more of the work out there, and in practice, I don't think the "Mechanical Turk" system is going to be workable for a lot of things, e.g., accounting disputes -- a CPA isn't going to run around low-bidding on crowdsourced-answers work when the dispute involves whether Fairfield Mall was hiding its profits so that it didn't have to pay Doctors Associates LLC (owners of the leased land on which the mall was built) the full amount of its profit-sharing.  But for simple, well-defined things, which probably didn't need the contract in the first place, it might work.

Well, it would be interesting, but someone still has to draft them, and more importantly, they will still need to be interpreted.
Take a simple example, Bob licenses his invention to Amalgamated Widgets for a straight royalty.  Amalgamated sits on it and then designs around Bob's patent.  Amalgamated then sells its own widgets that do the same thing, but which don't fall under the patent and so don't fall under the license.  Bob sues, pointing out the "best reasonable efforts" clause in the contract.  How is a computer-interpeted script going to decide whether Amalgamated's efforts were reasonable or not?  What if Amalgamated points out flaws in the invention that made it impracticable?  What if Bob shows a "working" prototype that differs slightly from the patent's embodiments, but still is arguably the same thing?
Anyway, there are always divorces, drunk drivers, and dying old folks who want to leave all their money to their cat.

I've read about the woes you in America have with regard to acquiring bitcoin.  I'm expatting it in Asia.  I can walk across the street to the largest convenience store chain in the country.  The stores have kiosks for sales of train tickets, bill payments, overseas remittances for maids, and the like.  One option is to obtain bitcoins; the fee is 1% to a local exchange plus an approx. US$0.75 (seventy-five cents) convenience charge to the store.
The same exchange is working on partnering with the other major convenience store chains here as well, so eventually instead of having to find that particular type of shop, of which there are only about 1700, it'll be any of the majors, or around 4000 locations.  Roughly as convenient as banking with an ATM.
The only downside is that you have to enter your phone number to receive an SMS, which gives you a webpage address at which you enter the public address that you want the BTC sent to.
If I were to want total anonymity, there is a Lamassu bitcoin ATM nearby that charges somewhere between 6% to 10% (hard to say exactly, because their pricing doesn't update instantly and they don't mention which exchange they get pricing from).
You might want to do a search for ATMs near you, since that would at least avoid the 15% premium someone charged you.
As an economist, you should of course understand that the market efficiency is low right now largely because of government interference (KYC/AML for Coinbase and Circle), which is why you ended up having to pay such a markup.

Nothing, IMHO, but then I'm not downvoting you either.
OTOH, I believe the reason the price is down so much is that it is correcting from a bubble that was created by the MtGox clusterfuck.  Whether it was internal or external, the price on MtGox got driven up by some sort of botnet, and that dragged the price up on all the other exchanges as well.  When MtGox finally imploded, that ended the manipulation from the botnet, but it left the price far above what was actually supportable.
I'd like to think we've found the supportable level now.  We've been fairly steady in the $3xx range for weeks, despite a major sell order pushing the price down for a while.
@_date: 2014-12-31 18:36:11
In a bankruptcy, the court freezes all assets of a company, and distributes them among the creditors according to a plan worked out under whatever bankruptcy code the court uses.
MtGox's problem was not the bankruptcy.  If MtGox had merely been bankrupt, the court would have taken all of its bitcoin and fiat currency accounts and other assets and (eventually) parceled them out.  In a commodities bankruptcy, customers would typically have their individual accounts and, if their account had assets in it, would be given those directly;  in other types of bankruptcy, they would be considered creditors (most likely the first-line creditors) and would be given a (first) distribution of the assets (and if first, other creditors would be paid out of any remainder, or out of a lesser-share split).
MtGox's problem was either fraud or theft, in addition to at least negligence if not internal fraud.
Regarding Coinbase, for whatever assets you allow them to hang onto for you, you would face the same type of risk.  Since they usually pay out fiat in a reasonable timeframe, there does not seem to be the "your money will be sent some time in the next six months" game that MtGox played.  As far as bitcoin purchased from them, you can transfer it immediately to a wallet on your own system and not face risks -- just as people could have and should have done at MtGox, but were either too lazy to do so or were blocked from doing so by MtGox's stalling.
The only thing that does give me some pause are the occasional complaints here that Coinbase cancels transactions, days after accepting a customer's order, possibly correlated to price moves.

This.  A year ago, the only way to buy bitcoin locally was over localbitcoins, where users charge ridiculous premiums.  Six months ago, a shop got a bitcoin ATM and charged 10%.  Two months ago, a new exchange got set up and is charging 1% (and the ATM now only charges about 6%).
In the medium run, with more competition, these businesses will reduce their fees even further, especially since the cost of a transaction is only pennies.  And in the long run, they're just a way to transition to using cryptocurrencies.

Wait, am I understanding this correctly?
* Item on Amazon costs $99.99
* I put up a request saying I will pay 0.31 BTC (approx $75)
* Someone buys it and ships it to me
* The someone gets 0.30 BTC (approx)
Or do I have the amounts reversed, and I need to pay 0.50 BTC?
Does this work with other merchants yet?  I have a bunch of equipment I need, and here it's trivial to get BTC (walk into any convenience store, pay 1% fee).  It's just a pain to buy anything because of international credit card issues.

I was quite serious when I wrote the above.  Starting around age 35, job offers started getting harder to find.  At age 40, they were gone completely.
Part of it was the dot.com bust, but it started happening well before that, even in the middle of the boom.  A lot was the ageism that is rampant in programming.  You're "a dinosaur", it's impossible for you to have learned the newest technologies, blah, blah, etc.
I had tons of good recommendations, I worked well with others, the software that I wrote worked beautifully, was clean, was well-documented, and it became absolutely impossible to get so much as an interview, much less hired.
Who knows, maybe it's changed.  I doubt it.  Age and experience are not respected in the slightest in software development, in my experience.  Quite the contrary.

I don't see a problem with banksters engaging in commerce with bitcoin -- buying it, holding it, selling it, making purchases with it.  I do see a problem with banksters engaging in derivatives trading against bitcoin.
One of the core features is the avoidance of double-spending, so that should rein in the worst of the rehypothecation nonsense that has been used to manipulate gold, silver, aluminum, copper, and other metals markets.  But I expect that a lot of people will be lured into leaving their bitcoin balances on an exchange, and that the exchange will then use the balances for its own trading (e.g., allowing shorting against them) much like MF Global did.  I also would not be surprised to see exchanges sell off bitcoin deposited with them (as in fractional reserve banking -- surely no more than, say, 10% of all customers might withdraw in a single day, right? and the exchange can always "have difficulties" and bog down transactions like MtGox did), and use the cash generated to play in the FX markets, commodity markets, stocks, options, or perhaps some adorable interest-rate bets like the ones that blew up AIG.

Can't speak for his charting, because I frankly think that charting is nothing more than voodoo, but after the drop to $275 in just a few days, I've become convinced that the price will fall back under $100.  How far below, well, I was thinking back to around $5.
As usage of BTC increases, it doesn't have to represent more value, especially as the financial model seems to be based on using it as a currency-exchange mechanism between fiats.  It becomes nothing more than an accounting ledger.  This is especially true with the remittance industry, which has been a major use-case discussed here for a while now.
Maybe when it hits $5, people will start holding, figuring that the price won't drop any more.  Dunno.

The advice isn't just "unplug for a few minutes".  The advice is to use a secure device.
For generating addresses, I use a Raspberry Pi that is never connected to the internet.  Keys are never saved in the clear on the SD card;  they get moved to encrypted storage immediately.  I would prefer to use a more powerful computer that never connects, but the RPi is sufficient.  Since it has no firmware memory onboard (firmware is loaded from the SD card at power-up), it's reasonably safe to leave laying around.  At $40, nearly anyone who uses bitcoin can afford one.

I use Raspian, and got it set up initially by using the web.  I also installed Firefox.  However, once set up, I removed the USB wifi thing and haven't put it back on since.
After generating addresses, I just save them on a USB stick.  You could do the same with paper wallets;  I find the strings to be sufficient.

Why wouldn't it be legal?  Bitcoin is considered a form of personal property.  You are allowed to sell your property.  You can sell lemonade on a street corner, you can put your car on Craigslist.  You can sell rabbits for "pets or meat", but once you hit $500 in sales per year you have to register with the USDA and follow their regulations.
The money-laundering thing is an issue when one does so commercially and in volume, enough to make it a business.  Each state's business laws are different, and they set their thresholds at which they require registration at different levels.

BTW, if he's transferring more than US$6,000, since most U.S. banks charge a flat $35 and Taiwan banks charge the equivalent of $25, he'd probably be better off just doing a bank transfer to his U.S. account.

Wrong.  If you walk into a grocery store with a handful of euros and try to buy groceries, they will direct you to your bank to exchange them into dollars first, and your bank will rape you up the ass on the exchange rate too.
Transacting in bitcoin doesn't cost anything.  Shifting from one currency to another always costs.  OTOH if you had done your trade on localbitcoins, you could have come out ahead on it because you could (and likely would) be the one charging a premium to sell your bitcoins to someone who really, really wanted to obtain them.

IMHO, there is no need to have the ledger continue to store information about empty addresses that were used once and then discarded.  Maintaining records about the current state is all that's necessary.  It's a flaw.  I understand that it's necessary given the system that Satoshi developed, but it would be better if one had been created that didn't need that.

Bitcoin doesn't follow the dollar.  If it did, it would still be worth about fifty cents per BTC, just like it was at in 2010.
Similarly, the USD to other currencies has not changed by 23% in the last ten days, yet BTC has declined by about that much against the USD in that timeframe.  (And I know damn well that it has, because I did a transaction a week ago on Sunday at $290 per BTC, and today it's quoted at $212.  Worked out well for me.)

Are you paying both sides, or only your own side?
From what I've seen of the transfer reports, most banks in the U.S. don't receive international transfers directly.  Instead, they pair with one of the big banks like Wells Fargo, which handles the international transfer for them and then ships the money to them within the U.S.  As a result, there are two fees.
I've also seen at least one transfer report where there was a third bank involved on the U.S. side.  I have no idea why.
Over here, meanwhile, our own bank charges something, but it's not much compared to the U.S. side.
Note that we have to pay all of the fees, because the recipient in the U.S. doesn't want to get a cut taken out of their fees.

In a "blockchain", you have that same database *replicated across multiple machines across a network*, where *any entity on the network can generate, execute, and confirm* the transaction, *and then the transaction must be replicated across the blockchain*.
Same steps, multiple times, plus the added complexity of consensus and communications.
His centrally-controlled blockchain makes zero sense.  I award him no points, and may God have mercy on his soul.

Follow the usual business licensing practices for that country;
Get a bunch of bitcoins;
Advertise that you'll exchange it for the local currency at whatever rate(s) you want;
Prepare your anus for the local government to screw you over, because every decent country out there already has bitcoin exchanges, so the only ones left are the corrupt shitholes.

What country are you in?  Different infrastructure exists in each.  Where I am, anyone can convert BTC to/from cash for roughly a 1% fee.
If no such service is available in your country or region, you could always start one, or else pay whatever the lowest fees available are.
Generally speaking, bitcoin should lower the cost of doing business for you, since you don't have to pay credit card fees (I hear 8% fees mentioned often for small businesses trying to get credit card terminals), chargebacks, security for moving the day's cash receipts to your bank, insurance against robbery. . . .

You don't understand ZH.  He writes articles on both sides of any particular issue, then later on only references the predictions that came true to show what a genius he is.
Two years from now if Bitcoin is in the toilet, he'll point back to the articles showing how much he said it sucked.  Five years from now if Bitcoin has taken over the entire financial industry, he'll point back to the articles telling people what an awesome idea it was to show what a genius he is.
It's what he always does.  Heads he wins, tails he wins.  Except not really, he just ignores whatever he wrote that is inconvenient.

Or, in other words, this CEO is a technological idiot.  There's no need for a "blockchain" if your entire model is based on presumed trust.  You can just use the same old transactional technologies and accounting that have been around since people first started using shells and rocks and bits of shiny metal to conduct trade.

The article doesn't say that $310,000,000 was stolen as a result of an altcoin, it says that the men operated a classic Ponzi scheme based on nutritional supplements and cosmetics.  The altcoin was apparently a rather trivial sideline they were using.

There are existing companies that do this.  J-list is a well-known one for shipping stuff from Japan to the U.S. for the otaku market.
You may run afoul of such things as food labeling laws, import duties, prohibitions on certain foods and ingredients (prosciutto is one that foodies in the U.S. are, or at least were, pissed off about), and trademark violations (such as the recent Cadbury's lawsuit).

That's a pretty decent background for it.  You'd be better off in an EE role somewhere, though.
It's a *very* small niche, and there are a lot of shady actors ( *cough* Karpeles *cough* ) involved who would rather hire friends or non-competent people rather than someone who has a clue.

Yeah, because price is the only measure of utility, and the fact that it's gone from $1200 to $240 proves that the runup from $0.000002 to $1200 per unit was a joke.

Most websites calculate the exchange ratio at the time of the transaction, not as a fixed amount that is good forever (or even for hours).  The BTCUSD has dropped a bit from 240 this morning to 230 now.  Has that hurt you further?
Did you get your transaction completed?  If not, I'd suggest buying extra next time.  I usually get about $10 more than I need, and have the BTC sent to a wallet generated by Rushwallet.com, where I then send the exact amount to the vendor and finally send the leftover change to an address I created elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-09-10 04:14:00
The price isn't being driven down continuously.  It's been relatively stable at $230 for months now.
It bubbled up for a little while when it looked like Greece was going to exit the Euro, which might have caused enough turmoil in currency markets to drive people to bitcoin as a safe haven.  The previous two years or so were all a recovery to normal levels from the enormous fraud at MtGox -- the "willy" bot, the coin theft, and all the rest.

Shorting also provides stabilization when the price does drop -- people want to lock in their winning short, and so they buy to cover it.

Not everyone who "uses" bitcoin is running around creating transactions.

From reading the OP's link, it sounds like they are using USD as the standard value for betting.  They don't mention what rate they will use to convert your USD account balance back to bitcoin, though.  And yes, I know "it fluctuates" -- most services that I have used do something like saying they use the rate from a specific exchange, or an average of three major exchanges, or whatever.  With this site, there is no mention of how they will do the conversion.
