Same. Even after all these years, my heart flutters when I click send. Especially on larger amounts. Never once had an issue, but I've seen too many posts on Reddit about people messing it up that I know it happens often. Just because I have some experience doing it, doesn't mean I'm immune to a random screw up.

Nobody is ever bailed out for making a bad investment. I don’t think anyone would argue that classism is a problem. Switching one group for another isn’t going to fix that. That being said, I don’t know what the solution is.
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:39:59
It needs to be easier to acquire, store safely and spend.
I know people have the idea, but better on ramps are needed. Being able to switch from your local fiat to BTC at your bank would be huge.
Trusted storage with an institution would be great. You could have the choice of them holding your keys, or s multi-sig setup so that they can’t do anything with your BTC without your approval. Maybe biometrics to make sure a person can’t forget their key.
Last but not least, spending quickly and safely.

You’re right. If bitcoin succeeds, there will be a new wealthy elite. There always has been and probably always will be unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:33:53
Lightning has a very good shot at fixing the issue.
Even if it doesn’t, atomic swaps from alts such as Litecoin is very interesting.
Bitcoin can remain a store of value while alts can be the transaction currencies.
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:36:53
I don’t think we’re talking about the same thing. MER is Management Expense Ratio. The fee charged for managing the mutual fund. 2% is average for an actively managed fund in Canada, but would be a very high fee for an index fund, which I feel a single asset fund like this one, more closely resembles.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:03:51
I’ll be happy either way.
@_date: 2018-09-28 13:32:53
Sure, as long as you’re technologically proficient.
The average person needs to be able to buy bitcoin as easily as they can buy a mutual fund in their 401k.
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:17:33
I hate to get all tinfoil hat, but you’re probably right. The SEC won’t let the regular folk at it until the institutions have had their piece first.
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:38:01
I completely agree with that, but that being said, isn't that true of mutual funds in general? It could be argued that unless you're holding the stock certificate, it's not yours.
Too bad it's simply impossible to hold bitcoin directly within tax-advantaged accounts. I would in a second.
I hold all of my bitcoin directly, but I have to admit, having some bitcoin in a tax free savings account sounds mighty appealing.
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:27:53
I have no idea. An average MER is 2% these days, but index funds charge far less.
Since this mutual fund only tracks the price of one asset, an MER of 2% seems unreasonable to me. But I haven’t seen that info, so I’m curious.
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:23:13
Yup. Trojan horse the system. Once it's integrated and accepted everywhere, you'll be free to use your own bitcoin as you see fit. You won't have to use their system, but bitcoin will have been legitimized.  A lot of people will always use it within the "system", never holding their own keys, but many will also learn to work outside of it.

I love all these super bullish forecasts, but I can't help but feel it's all just pure speculation. So many things would have to happen to see 2% of all the world's money being invested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:46:57
Thats what I’m saying. Bitcoin wouldn’t be the transactional currency in an LN/AS world. It would be the settlement currency/store of value currency. An alt like Litecoin with LN enabled would be the transactional currency.
That’s assuming bitcoin/LN doesn’t manage to scale as well is people hope. It very well might.
If it does, alts will have much less reason to exist.

I hold until I can spend it directly to fund my lifestyle. I want to pay my bills using bitcoin, do my shopping using bitcoin, book my vacations using bitcoin, pay insurance premiums in bitcoin (and have claims paid out in bitcoin). I'm holding until it's ubiquitous or it goes to zero. Obviously I believe the former is far more likely.
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:01:51
I’m not disagreeing with you, I’m just pointing out that people give up their control of assets all the time.
That “small” tax break can be pretty huge though. If you’re in the highest tax bracket, you stand to lose a quarter of your gains in taxes.
So it’s a trade-off that some people might be willing to make.
Me, personally, I’d rather hold the keys and I always will for the majority of my bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:44:48
I'm guessing fiat crypto such as the recently announced one from Gemini will be easy to trade on a decentralized exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:44:40
Your math is good, but there won't be 21M BTC until roughly a century from now. Change that number to 17M for a more contemporary calculation.
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:10:29
I agree. It's not a bad solution for most people. The person I was responding to doesn't seem to have any ideological flexibility when it comes to control of private keys. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:02:27
That's similar to what I do. I have my hardware wallet for storage of BTC I planing on holding and I have a mobile wallet that I keep a negligible amount of BTC on to spend. I replenish the spend wallet every now and then.
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:29:50
I completely agree. Which is why bitcoin is great. It will allow people who want full independence from the banking system to do just that and they will be able to transact to those who prefer to stay within it.
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:07:10
It's always been the same. People who end up wealthy aren't the lemmings that follow suit when things are easy. It's the people who see the revolution coming and make the effort to get in on the ground floor who make the real money, though there is risk.

@_date: 2018-09-19 17:47:58
Agreed. Which is why one second layer solution or another will come in handy at some point. Lightening is actually looking pretty solid at this point. That combined with atomic swaps will allow for other cryptos to be used as payment currency too. The future looks bright!
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:47:35
This fund is garbage unless you can afford to invest so much the fees are meaningless. It’s a first step though, next I’d like to see a fund available to all investors with a reasonable MER.

@_date: 2018-09-15 12:35:10
It will be fine. The miners are still out there and won’t just shutdown. Plus there are multiple other manufacturers now to take bitmain’s place if need be.
Antpool users will distribute to other pools.
BCH might take a shit-kicking if they are forced to liquidate their holdings though.
That being said, I doubt bitmain is about to shut down.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:25:15
It's a bit of a catch 22 isn't it. As much of holder as I am, I do make an effort to buy and spend bitcoin when I see a merchant accepting it. In fact, I tend to go out of my way to support merchants who accept bitcoin and I know I'm not the only one. The more of us who are willing to spend our BTC, the more merchants will be willing to accept BTC, which will encourage more of us to spend BTC which will encourage...

It would be nice, but not necessary. lightening is one second layer scaling solution that seems to be working for now. If it doesn't, something else can be done.

People keep saying this, but I’m in the hospital all the time with my special needs son and I’ve never waited more than an hour, and THAT was long!
I’ve known people who got diagnosed with cancer and were actively getting treatment less than a week later.
My brother really messed up his leg this summer in a freak accident and he was in surgery within hours of the incident. His life wasn’t in danger, he was just in pain.
My dad is getting older and has really bad hip pain and wanted cortisone shots, which required a specialist. He saw his family doctor within two days, got a referral, and met the specialist 5 days later.
I know my experience is anecdotal and different regions might be better than others, but this wait time argument isn’t one I’ve experienced personally or through those I know.
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:42:33
I don’t trade because a) I don’t feel many alts add value and b) I don’t want to trigger capital gains.
Too many people trade without regard for taxes.
I’ve heard of people trading BTC near the all time high, triggering a gain in 2017, only to have less crypto (as in, not even enough to pay taxes) in USD at tax time. Trading literally made them broke. Had they simply held, they’d be in a very positive position.

@_date: 2017-02-11 15:44:49
I wouldn't expect it to be the "only" one. I'm sure most countries would keep some form of fiat currency. It might become ubiquitous enough that most merchants worldwide start accepting it alongside their local currency though. In that scenario, capturing $20trillion of the worldwide $300trillion isn't TOO far fetched. Unlikely, yes. Impossible, I don't feel it is.

The global market cap is ~$300trillion.

@_date: 2017-02-16 16:40:15
We shall see. The run up might just be optimism from the general public too. We all *hope* it will be approved, and this will cause some to speculate because they want to get in before it's "too late".
I already hold all the bitcoin I will ever own, so I'm of course hoping it will be positive news. I'm just not counting on it. Would be a huge win though, as it will help prove Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value.

Makes sense. I can totally understand why you did it. I might have done the same in your situation.
I managed to reach my goal of 21BTC and I told myself I'm going to ride to the moon or into the ground. When I acquired the BTC, it was at a price that was fairly insignificant to my net worth. As the price rises though, it's becoming a measurable percentage, so it's tempting to take profit, but I believe in Bitcoin as a currency and I want to hold it until I don't have to convert it back to fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:39:10

Votes can and ARE reconsidered in plenty of situations. In Canada, the UK, Australia and plenty of other countries, if a government is voted in and people lose faith, a motion of non-confidence can bring them down and the vote will have to get redone. That's a good thing. It prevents psychopaths who gained power through a series of missteps and random happenstance from ruining the country.
That's not as easy with something like Brexit. This has to be done right the first time.

@_date: 2019-06-25 19:07:28
I feel like you’re talking in circles to try and prove a point to support your opinion.
Referendums aren’t designed to trigger a definitive action based on the will of the majority. We had a referendum here in Canada back in the 90s about Quebec separating. The prime minister at the time even said that he wouldn’t have allowed separation if it passed by a small majority. They voted against separating, so nothing came of it.
All that to say that referendums are a tool used by governments to give them insight about what the people currently want. Not a green light to push full-steam ahead. 
Like I said, we won’t agree and that’s ok. You’re allowed your point of view.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:55:26
I agree with you in principle, but it seems to me that a lot of people very much regret their vote. I've heard of a lot of people who voted in favour of Brexit simply to send a message, never thinking in a million years it would actually pass.
If they choose not to leave without holding another vote, then I don't feel that's right, but for a move a monumental as this, I think holding another referendum wouldn't be unreasonable. People who are in favour of Brexit will disagree of course.

This might be a stupid question, but is there still a chance Brexit won't happen at all?
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:31:05
What about to the people who voted to leave but regret that decision? There are a lot of those people. You’ll probably say it’s their fault for voting that way to begin with, but that’s not a very kind position to take. As someone who evidently supports Brexit, I know you won’t agree and that’s ok, but I feel an event of this magnitude should respect the *true* wishes of the populace, not just the knee-jerk reaction that was influenced by short-term fear and anger.

Please point out the altcoin I mentioned or the specific product advertised. If you say I advertised an ETF, consider I replied to your link about an ETF in a thread about an ETF.
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:10:10
Ok. It’s clear you don’t know he’s you’re talking about. We can safely ignore anything you say.
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:44:39
Um, I know. I was pointing out how people use trusted third parties to hold their valuable assets all the time because it’s more convenient. You can hold your own certificates, gold, cash and keys if you want. Most people don’t though.
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:06:15
Except that an ETF isn’t a blockchain token at all, so by definition, it can’t be an Altcoin.
You seem to be very angry because you can’t support your argument. You just spout off factually incorrect statements. Nobody said you have to like or use the ETF, but do yourself a favour. Making shit up and twisting facts to support your argument isn’t helping your case. People see straight through it, which I think you know and is why you’re so angry.
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:02:15
Bitcoin doesn’t pay dividends. The ETF will fluctuate in value based on the underlying asset. So if you want to cash out, you simply sell shares of the etf. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:23:37
We are talking about the validity of a bitcoin ETF, which you posted a link about. We are discussing the merits, which is exactly on topic for this thread. I never advertised anything, nor did I even utter a word about altcoins. 
Anyhow, the mods will see that you’re being antagonistic with everyone trying to communicate with you on the subject.
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:05:40
Don’t you have better things to do than go through all the ETF threads and post this link?
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:29:59
That’s your opinion. Not an objective fact.
In fact, I’m sure even you know it’s not a scam. It might not be an instrument that interests you or that you like or even one that aligns with Bitcoin’s original vision, but it is most assuredly not a scam.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:26:00
You’re taking about a balance sheet vs realized gains or losses.  They are two important aspects of finances. You seem to be mixing both of these up.
Bitcoin is not dead code. That in itself is ridiculous enough to dismiss anything you say.
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:22:22
The ideal ETF would buy and sell Bitcoin as people buy and sell shares of the ETF, so yes, buying and selling the ETF would have a similar effect on the price of bitcoin as buying and selling bitcoin itself.
For the enthusiast, I’d suggest still controlling your own keys whenever possible. What the ETF will allow though, is buying bitcoin in tax sheltered accounts like IRAs and 401Ks if your American. Other counties have similar account like Canada with the RRSP and TFSA. Most people have the majority of their wealth in tax advantaged account like those and so far, can’t use it to buy bitcoin. With an ETF, they will be able to easily and so open up another huge amount of money for investment in bitcoin.
Also, institutions will not want to hold their own keys, when possible, they will want an insured custodian to hold the keys for them. Institutional money eclipses individual tax-sheltered accounts in terms of magnitude.
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:29:12
I’ve already addressed how it’s not a scam earlier in our conversation. You might not like it, but it’s not as if it’s a Ponzi scheme. It’s a legitimate financial instrument that you a free to not use.
I probably won’t use it, but it will be a good on-ramp for the layman.
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:51:45
Jesus. Do you have your own stock certificates? Do you have all your fiat in cash in a safe?
For fuck’s sake. Andreas said that about bitcoin because there wasn’t a safe way to own it without controlling your own keys. The average person is willing to let a trusted third party hold their assets. Most people don’t want to have to figure out a hardware wallet. If you want bitcoin to be mainstream, these types of services will be necessary.
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:02:20
Hi again! Still posting this link in every thread Eh?You might not like ETFs, but they have their place.

I’d say the same of you.
At least some of the custodial services are insured so that IF something happens, you won’t lose your money. How often do people loose their traditional ETFs because the exchange got hacked? Never. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:35:52
You’re entitled to your opinion.

Again, that is your opinion, not an objective fact.
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:25:09
Mtgox was a good lesson. Don’t trust a Magic the Gathering trading website with your wealth. We now have legitimate exchanges and finance companies offering custodial services. You don’t have to like it or even use it. Hold your own keys! I do! But comparing Fidelity and Coinbase to mtgox is silly and you know it. Don’t use weak argument like that to prove your point. You’re only hurting your credibility.
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:21:01
You do you.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:21:08
When investing, the loss is only realized when you sell the asset. So if you only invest an inconsequential (meaning you can still take your wife to a movie or take a vacation) amount of money and hold onto it through a market cycle, you haven’t lost anything.
You’re dead code comment makes me regret even writing that first paragraph because it’s obvious you’re just trolling.

For 10BTC to be equal to a billionaire today, I single bitcoin would need to be worth $100M.
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:22:44
Exactly. What’s stopping people from investing with bitcoin instead of inflationary currency? Sure you might have less incentive because your bitcoin will retain it’s spending power, but most people aren’t happy with simply keeping pace with inflation. If that were the case, everybody would be in CDs. People want more, so people will invest.

This drop sucks, no doubt, but the only people who are panicking are those who bought more than they can afford to lose, or those who bought out of FOMO last year.
Those who bought before 2017 are still WAY up.
The question is, do you want to buy while there is blood in the streets, or do you want to buy later when FOMO sets back in.
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:35:21
This is the kind of thing that will eventually help bitcoin be less volatile.

Why don’t you address my post? We are talking about bitcoin and what is possible.
It’s possible to have your own stock certificates, cash, gold etc. In physical form in your house. It’s not convenient, so people don’t do it. It’s the same with holding your own keys for the layman. For what it’s worth, I personally agree that you should hold your own keys. I hold my own keys! But I also know not everybody will want to do it and would rather trust a custodial service.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:19:11

They are a bastardization which is why I’ll be holding on to my own private keys.

I'm no expert, but I don't understand why it couldn't scale with 2nd layer solutions.

First, I was asking a question, because I don’t know if that’s the case. Seems plausible to me because manipulation of crypto markets is absolutely a thing.

@_date: 2017-05-28 12:10:51
That was me 4 years ago.
I started mining Litecoin because Bitcoin mining difficulty was too high.
I convinced myself LTC was the Silver to Bicoin's gold and would eventually be worth exactly 1/4 of BTC.
I've since stopped mining LTC, but I've kept all my coins. I'm happy about that lately.
That being said, I've been buying nothing but BTC since because I realized it's likely to stay the dominant crypto. I'm happy I've done that too.

@_date: 2018-04-11 20:09:09
It’s like the 486sx/dx of old. The sx was exactly the same as the dx, but with some efficiencies disabled. It’s an artificial way to create a base and premium model with only one development cycle.

if you’re a teenager, I can accept this as youthful ignorance to social norms. Just a momentary greedy lapse of judgement, hoping to cash in on a subject your were ill-informed on.
If you’re older than that, no amount of apologizing will change the fact that you’re a lying, opportunistic piece of shit. I hope it’s the former, but if it’s the later, take a step back and re-evaluate your life.

Between lightning, rootstock, schnorr and fungibilty, bitcoin is developing all the positive aspects of the leading alts. It makes you wonder which tokens will survive long term when the granddaddy can also do what these new tokens tout as an advantage. I’m genuinely curious.
