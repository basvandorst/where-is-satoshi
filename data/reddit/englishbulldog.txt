Bitcoin is already a real currency.  Your points are wrong.
  
The irony here is that you are saying you won't buy Bitcoin because it isn't a "real currency" when there is probably a 100% chance that if Bitcoin fit your criteria for a real currency you still wouldn't buy it because there wouldn't be anything different about it, it wouldn't have the same potential and your current currency is working just fine for you.  So really you're framing a flawed argument and lying to yourself(and us).

You are wrong and I recommend reading about Bitcoins blockchain and how it works in practice.  Specifically you are wrong when you said "Bitcoin was destroyed and Bitcoin was created, no coin went anywhere" as it relates to their linkability from the point they were minted.  Bitcoins are never destroyed, ever, under any circumstances.  And the only time they are ever created is as a coinbase reward or as the result of a bug(that hasn't happened since the very early days).  So go figure out why you were wrong.  You have a misunderstanding and I am not sure where it stems from.

Lowering interest rates is one of the only mechanisms that the Fed has for countering a crisis.  So if Trump interferes with that, it will be on him, not the Fed.

It usually takes a couple of days both directions for me but that's domestic.  Not sure how long an international transfer takes.

The more you do business with them the better it gets.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:46:29
Your submissions are usually better thought out than this.  If a coin can be treated differently based on its history, then by definition it is not fungible.  This is currently the case with Bitcoin.  Being able to find a party who will exchange it doesn't make it fungible since the history is still there and prejudice can be applied at any time.

And I would also start buying Bitcoin on the same schedule as you contribute to your 401k.  Whether it's $20 dollars a week or $1000 I would start now and do this for a couple of years.  Bitcoins potential should not be ignored but do not put more into it than you can afford to lose.  It is high risk with the potential for high reward.

@_date: 2019-07-07 23:28:29
Fungibility is the property that describes the ability to be interchangeable due to one type being indistinguishable from another of the same type.  With Bitcoin, each "coin" has its own history and they are usually different.  With extra data their history can be enumerated to an extent.  Like who owned it or what it was spent on and where.  And this will continue as time goes on and data is consolidated to create a bigger picture.  Because of this history prejudice can be applied to a coin because of its history at any point in the future.  So that impacts its ability to be a fungible currency.

Your court example is not an example of fungibility.  Fungibility is a property and that property is the inability to distinguish one coin from another resulting in the inability to apply prejudice based on the distinction.  The distinction in the Bitcoins case being its history.  You cannot see the history of monero I send you so you cannot apply prejudice.  You cannot even see the real address that sent it.  Seriously, go understand monero and how it achieves fungibility and you'll have a better understanding of the word.  A word you clearly do not understand.

Think of them as a bitcoin broker.  They are good for buying and selling and holding but not trading.  If you try and use them as an exchange(high frequency trading), you will run into trouble with their system since it's not built for that.  
  
I've seen people on here who have had trouble when trying to play the market.  For instance, people with instant buys have had trouble when they have tried buying low and selling high before the original transaction has even completed(ACHs take days).  It all makes sense to them chronologically but the system isn't built for that.  This can trigger fraud algorithms and give you headaches until support gets around to you to sort it out.  A lot of times the system just sorts itself out but people freak out because the system takes time(ACHs take days) and they run around reddit screaming fire.

Yes.  Consider that we are going to have millions of people introducing themselves to bitcoin over the next few years.  We should be keeping it as easy to understand as possible during that time.

At one point last year, they indicated that they bought most of their coins for under $10.  And they have said since then that they have not sold any of their coins nor do they intend to.  If they were in this purely to get rich, why didn't they sell at $1200 and walk away?  Do the math and you quickly realize that there is more at stake here for the twins than improving a bottom line.  It's almost like they believe in the long-term potential of bitcoin.

Even this trust-less bitcoin still requires trust on some level and probably always will.
  
How about finding a solution to the fucked up miner market?  It seriously needs to be disrupted.  A not-for-profit mining company for the people by the people is what we need right now.  We need a non-profit that builds and ships your miners in a transparent way in an effort to empower and protect the people.  Right now we have a bunch of shiesters crowd-sourcing their own for-profit companies and screwing over the actual investors while taking all of the profit and leaving the investors to barely break even after their hardware has been "tested".  This needs to stop.  When people ask if there is a mining company that can be trusted to ship so you can reach ROI there needs to be an option for that.  There isn't and the default answer is that it's better to buy bitcoin, this is only helping to consolidate mining!  This is not good for bitcoin!

I agree with what you have said and I would like to add to it.  In the event of a nuclear war or a natural disaster that wipes out bitcoin and governments and their fiat(by extension), then in those cases, bullets and rice are probably better stores of value.
  
It's a complicated topic but there really is no single commodity that rules the rest.  The investor that is best equipped for the future is the one that has diversified into many areas.
  
Something that I have noticed that gets me really excited about bitcoin isn't bitcoin itself, it's what it has done to educate people.  More and more people are now taking a closer look at how the world financial systems work and not just taking them for granted.  We have a whole new generation of young people waking up to the idea of investing way sooner than they probably would have.  It's the network affect that bitcoin brings that it the most valuable part of it.  It's making us smarter.

Hi Mandrik,
I recently added some watch-only addresses to my wallet and it combines them with my regular balance.  I DO NOT WANT THIS!  These are watch-only addresses and I do not want them included with the spendable amount; it's confusing since I purposefully added them as watch-only because I have no intention of spending them. 
  
Can you please look at abstracting the watch-only total from the wallet total?  Maybe put it under the wallet total in a different color like grey?  Or maybe add a setting to turn off inclusion of the watch only addresses in the total?

I read the story and the under cover police were open with the exchangers that they planned to use the money for illegal purposes.  They were open about trying to launder money.  It wasn't a scenario where you land in Paris, turn on your exchange app and find someone to exchange a few hundred euros with for your stay there.
  
I didn't mean to imply that my example could happen over night.  We do have a ways to go.  But with a distributed exchange, it could be hard for the police to do what they did in this case.  In this case, they were able to target people based on their history and ratings in a centralized environment.  Anonymity could be built into any distributed exchange.

I spend bitcoin on things.  I do it because those things now cost me less than if I had used the fiat in my pocket(because it didn't increase in value).  Some of that fiat in my pocket is always going into bitcoin at whatever the price is when I buy it and will get spent later when it's worth more.

Using a merchant exchange option like Coinbase or BitPay means that the merchant can instantly get dollars for those bitcoins.  The merchant takes no risk in this scenario.  Merchants that don't want to or cannot use these services or services like them, for whatever reason, are taking risk.

We just need to port the Social Security system to its own blockchain and start chipping every American Citizen that wants to vote.  The chip will correlate to their SS address on the blockchain and only they can spend from it.  When a vote needs to take place the Social Security Office(or some entity) funds all address with a token that can be used to vote.  You vote by sending your token to the address corresponding to your candidate.  It could be used for other things too.
  
Anyway, the chip example is a bit extreme but could be the best option for ensuring one-vote-one-person.  You could do it other ways, like with government issued ID etc..

Answer by Ron Paul, Former Congressman from Texas, on Quora,
Bitcoin is a very interesting subject because for many years in Congress, I was a champion of legalizing competition in currencies.
We have a terrible monetary system today. We have a government that purposely counterfeits and debases the currencies and I believe that the alternative would be a competition. That means that anything that wants to substitute for the American dollar should be permitted. There should be no prohibitions; there should not be a monopoly and a cartel running our monetary system because it so often benefits the privileged few. We certainly saw this in the bailing out of the financial system where the wealthy bankers got bailed out it in this recent and severe recession. I am a strong believer in competition. Bitcoin is an introduction to that.
Though I don’t personally believe that Bitcoin is true money, it should be perfectly legal and there should be no restrictions on it, there should be no taxes on it. The people who operate Bitcoin would, of course, be prohibited from committing fraud but the people should be able to have competition whether it is a basket of commodities or crypto-currencies – it should be perfectly legal. For this to operate, we need to have freedom from government intervention when it comes to the Internet. I am concerned that the government ultimately wants to curtail the Internet and there have been attempts to do so.
The internet is the salvation for those of us who believe in liberty because it is an alternative way of getting around the system not only in the spreading of our ideas in this instance but in in terms of getting around the monetary system on the whole if they do permit crypto-currencies and other forms of transactions. So, this is something that we should all be concerned about whether we endorse it or not.
What we should all argue for is the use of freedom rather than having a monetary system with regulation domination that is run by a cartel and the special interests – that is the kind of system we have today. We want a system that truly challenges the government in their ability to take care of the very wealthy at the expense of the middle class and the poor.

  It's the merchants that are already hooked into the closed POS systems that have to wait right now and they are the prey for CoinKite at this particular moment.  That hunting ground will dry up overnight as soon as the big names integrate crypto, there isn't a chance in hell that won't do it with some form of crypto, whether that's bitcoin or something else.

Yes.  Start learning about Software Defined Networking and you will quickly understand how near we are to a time when *they* can block a protocol and **adapt** in real-time to efforts to change/disguise that traffic.
  
There is a noticeable amount of complacency regarding just what our governments can do to stop what they want to stop.  It's dangerous to be complacent like that.
  
Look at today's news where Net Neutrality was struck down and remember years back how ISPs were throttling bittorrent traffic.  Replace bittorrent with bitcoin but with brand new tools and you have a world of hurt, or not.

Not even close.  I can walk to their headquarters and they have confidence from very heavy hitters in the VC arena.  Coinbase had similar growing pains early on with their portal.  I expect Xapo will rise if they get a payment processor.  Everything hinges on them getting one as they don't offer anything for the average consumer otherwise unless they become a bitcoin broker like Coinbase.

My point is that your insinuation that because something is not backed by a precious metal, it has no real value, is wrong.  Fiat currencies do have value because you can exchange it for something you need or want.  In some ways, fiat is superior to precious metals in the short term because you can more easily exchange it for goods.  Bitcoin takes the ability to exchange to a new level.
  
FYI - I've been a gold bug for years now and I believe in it as a store of value.

There is no reason to.  If you want to hold the keys and know they are safe then don't share the private key.  If you want Coinbase to hold the coins so you can sell them, send them to Coinbase. 
  
The current system allows Coinbase to have complete control of the coins they hold.  If coins go missing, they don't have to argue with anyone, they only need to focus within to find the answer.  Holding coins that someone else has the private keys for introduces liability that they don't need or want.

Bitcoin has real value and is an advertising machine without tipping on reddit.

Unlike Fiat you cannot corrupt this system without it being seen.  It operates in the open on a public ledger.

They would be at a disadvantage in comparison with other countries who do not operate in the open or are not friendly to bitcoin.

The questions that reveal more useful information are ones that revolve around why and who.  Humans will be directing machines to perform the actions so it's probably more important to ask the who and why in order to gain the information needed to nip this in the bud.  Scaring people into moving to another pool only prolongs the inevitable ability, based on current code.
  
Why would someone perform a 51% attack if they could?  The why helps to spell out the who.  Only a select membership can go the other way.

He's having a laugh while making a point and I applaud him for it.  He is teaching and hurting no one in the process.  If he makes a few dollars off maxcoin, all the power to him--better him than someone who isn't going to use the profits for the greater good.

I'm going to re-word this since so many people didn't understand my reply in a very fundamental level as it relates to your actual question.
  
Your question is will further subdivision of a bitcoin be inflationary.  Since your question didn't ask about price and only focused on access tokens or the smallest unit you need to use the blockchain, I focused on inflation of the supply(this is not the same as inflating price or value).  As it relates to the supply of access tokens as you call them, yes, making 1 bitcoin further divisible creates more access tokens as you have inflated the supply of available access tokens through further subdivision of a single unit(1BTC).  1BTC is still 1BTC but it might be divisible up to 200,000,000 satoshis instead of 100,000,000 depending on where you move the decimal in order to achieve your further divisibility.  This is inflating the supply.  Price and value will be determined by the market since it is unregulated.

I call bullshit on that.

@_date: 2015-01-15 17:24:40
The bottom line is that bitcoin offers freedom from a rigged system.  A system that in a lot of ways, benefits the haves and not the have-nots.
  
The reason you are able to expect $2 eggs, $4 milk and the ability to keep your gas tank full is a result of this rigging.  On the surface that seems like it is a good thing, but what most people don't see is the suffering needed to bring you those prices.
  
Because bitcoin is a free market, there is no one person who can control the price and because it is so young and we are still in the beginning stages of adoption, it is very volatile as many forces work to carve out their piece of this free market.   The volatility is a sign of its vigor at such a young age; if it wasn't volatile, that would mean that it wasn't being used and there wasn't so many demands.  As the ecosystem grows, bitcoin should stabilize but again, it is a free market and that is not a guarantee but very likely over an extended period of time.
  
The problems you've mentioned have already been largely solved from a customer\merchant buying and paying perspective.  Companies like BitPay and Coinbase allow merchants to accept bitcoin with zero risk and exposure to the price, or as much exposure as they want.  This is a necessary stop-gap in growth and we will see this sort of thing happening whenever there is a need to be filled that can be filled, again free market at work.  
  
Bitcoin is a very complex free market that has a lot of growth to do before it stabilizes.  To focus only on the currency aspect of bitcoin is a mistake because it is more than just a currency since it also acts a store of value over time and a store of information that appears to be open, un-corruptable and widely distributed.  Bitcoin is the biggest experiment since the internet and nobody can say for sure how it will turn out.
  
If you want to participate in a truly free market, now is your chance.

You're making yourself super easy to track by doing that..  I'd say you're as safe as your environment you do it from.  If your device is compromised, it won't matter if it's bip38 or not if you're re-using.

I said it was a type of inflation.  I'm not talking price or value, I am talking about inflating the supply.  If you move the decimal point, you have inflated the supply of satoshis.  This is really basic stuff.

It increases the quantity.  Don't play word games.  I am not going to repeat myself either, look through my previous submissions if you're really having trouble.  The topic of this thread was created asking a question about if divisibility inflates the supply of spendable tokens.  The answer is yes, that is all there is to it.  In other news, we commonly refer to the smallest spendable unit as a satoshi and I expect this will continue for a long time.

If there was no physical limitation to how much you can divide an apple, then you could inflate the supply of the apple by further subdividing it.  But an apple can only be divided so much before it is no longer an apple.  This is why jratcliff63367's reply is wrong.  The OP isn't asking about price inflation but rather supply inflation and the apple analogy has limitations that bitcoin does not have(it does actually have them but they are much bigger and not necessary for illustrating this point). 
  
Bitcoin can be further subdivided by simply moving the decimal place.  By moving the decimal place you create more satoshis and there isn't a limit to how much you can do this but there are computational limits that you would encounter.  This is getting into limits introduced by physics and isn't necessary for this response.  The point is that bitcoin is not apples and you can divide a bitcoin way more than you can divide an apple before you run into problems(different problems for each case).

wow, both of you?  He didn't ask about inflating the price, he asked about inflating the available access tokens or the smallest unit needed to access the blockchain.  In other words, he asked if further subdividing bitcoin(moving the decimal place) creates more access tokens(inflates the supply) and the answer is YES!

Paycoin and the $20 Base: An Overview
As PayBase has a vibrant community of users worldwide, this blog will serve as yet another means of updating readers about important events and information involving various milestones and points of clarification.
Specifically, this post addresses – and further explains – the financial model behind Paycoin, with regard to the $20 floor established by PayBase.
Please note: For those already familiar with this issue, and concerning those individuals who have voluntarily written about the reasoning behind this pricing decision, you have our thanks. We nonetheless want to be on the record with this post – free of ambiguity, or any room for conjecture or misinterpretation – so our decision-making process is transparent and intelligible.
The Financial Model
Since cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy, with all the attendant volatility associated with an enterprise of such dynamic activity, the financial model for Paycoin reflects the existence and combined performance of other coins.
Thus, our approach involves a methodical analysis of forecasts about expanded market capitalization, the total number of investors and the collective purchasing history among users. These factors, as sources for repeated examination and calculation, reveal what the sustainable price for Paycoin should be.
The tabulation of these figures is very much like a mathematical equation – there is nothing arbitrary to our strategy – because this project requires at least one constant.
And, because Paycoin is an accessible currency, modeling the coin with a $20 valuation complements our business philosophy.
The mathematics structured to support this goal underscores this fact: That, given our emphasis on expanding market capitalization, and crafting the mechanisms to ensure the market did not grow faster than the rate of adoption among users, the overall growth rate would be consistent to sustain the $20 price.
Our pre-IPO disclosure reinforces this assertion about the $20 figure.
Which is to say, it made sense – it still makes sense – to model things based on the real (and measurable) spending and buying habits of users.
In the end, however, we know that the marketplace controls the price of the coin . . . but when enough people come together, and when that scenario seems very much achievable, the $20 valuation is quite fair.
As to the statement about PayBase purchasing Paycoin – that "We would buy 'them' for $20" – its origins are the result of the modeling described above.
Our Core Belief in Paycoin
We believe in Paycoin, period.
To reiterate: We have not wavered in our position; we have not faltered regarding our conclusion.
We stand by our reasoning.
More importantly, we stand behind Paycoin – and we seek to uphold the promises we make.

I guess they could adjust the cost of running the scripts so that the price of ether doesn't matter.  I have seen no talk of that.  But that's not sustainable in the long term as it affects miners incentives and eventually they would need to adjust the divisibility of an ether which is another form of inflation.
Do you have any ideas for how they will keep the cost of running scripts affordable enough to make it useable and accessible?  If ether is not inflationary and people horde it like they do bitcoin, over time it will discourage people from using the platform for its intended purpose.

The whole SR thing is highly questionable.  A couple of things to consider:
  
1) The source of the testimony that is causing all of this controversy is from a DHS employee telling us his *theory*.  This is the sole source of this so far.  This is coming from an agency that is about as effective at protecting the homeland as the TSA.  They're both just jobs programs that will literally hire anyone who meets a set of criteria with a low bar.
  
2) We're supposed to believe that Karpeles bought SR from Ross and then when the heat was on, Karpeles lured back Ross to be the fall guy.  Why wouldn't he just shut it down and destroy all evidence if the heat was on?  I don't buy it.
  
3) We've got people like Olivier who is not biased piling on this story with public accusations of death threats and not backing them up.  Why now, why not earlier?  My shitty theory is that it helps stir the pot for Ross and Olivier has a hard-on for Ross.  He needs to back up his public claims if they are true or stfu.

I think drugs should be legal too, but I don't condone contributing to systems that hurt people because I disagree with it.  Also, legalization doesn't automatically start protecting the innocent.  Sneakers like Nike are legal but many innocent people have been taken advantage of in the process of bringing them to the market.  It takes people to stand up and point out what is wrong and work to make it right and create an environment that helps as many people as possible.  Ulbricht, Shrem and Faiella did not do that and there is no evidence that they tried to do anything other than help themselves while tarnishing bitcoin in the process.

So if you get the installer, your flow looks like this.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.  The price of gas is still artificially set and not by the market price of ETH.  So if ETH moons, the cost of running scripts will become expensive unless you make a change.  If ETH floors it may become affordable to attack it within unless you make a change.

When you see large chunks of days destroyed like this it means that someone is moving coins that haven't been active in a long time.  They have been resting at their address and not being used.

When you've understood and acknowledged that a bitcoin is divisible to whatever we collectively decide it will be divisible to, I may engage you again.  Your refusal to acknowledge how bitcoin works on a fundamental level will result in the same attitude from me.
  
To reiterate:  1 BTC is equal to 100,000,000 satoshis because we say it does by agreeing where we place a decimal in the code.  It can be divisible to 200,000,000 satoshis if we collectively agree to move the decimal in the code.  This would be inflating the supply of the smallest transferable unit of a bitcoin.

We can argue the semantics for days but the fundamentals are correct.  
  
- Empowering the violent creates more violence.  Ask the Mexican families south of the border how the drug war is working out for them.  Then consider if drugs are legalized, how will that magically stop their tendencies if they continue to be funded.
  
- Ending prohibition did not end alcohol trade related violence.  Read up on that era and the role the mobs played after prohibition.
- Participating in the illegal drug trade will not make drugs legal.  But making drugs legal appears to be the first step towards sanity as evidenced by Portugal and Peru but both of those cases are not even close to perfect or representative of a fully legal environment.

Unlike some around here, whether he did or did not put out hits on people, he still did bad things for selfish reasons that have nothing to do with making the world a better place.  He used bitcoin as a tool to get rich not caring one bit about the negative stigma he was creating around it.  He had a massive fortune he could have used for good, but he made no attempt to help people with it.  He had control of SR at various times and did nothing to shut it down(because it was making him rich).  To me, he is nothing more than a drug dealer trying to beat the system to get rich.

Shutting down SR makes it harder for them to sell their product and use the proceeds to further their agendas.  It also pushes the customers out into the open and doesn't allow the problem to be masked.  Only through awareness of the issue can we undo the laws.

I don't understand.  What magical force is driving down the value of ether if it is too *expensive* to run scripts?  As best I can tell, monetary functions of ether do not depend on scripts to function while the inverse is the case...  maybe I missed it?
  
note: I am not ignoring the fact that expensive is relative.. it could very well be that ethereum could hum along and compete in the beginning and it very much looks like that is the attack vector here.  But with the intended or unintended end result of being a tool only accessible to the 1% like any other 'legit' system we have today.  Sure, the currency and its divisibility will ensure accessibility to anyone that wants to participate, but the tool that could empower the least advantaged will be inaccessible if not artificially influenced by added code and expectations(depending on what those initially are).

This is true.  Ether should be able to be used for all of the above and more.  The devil is in the details.  In order for ether to compete with bitcoin as a store of value, it needs to have a finite supply and this is counter to the health of the ethereum platform as a whole.  If the supply of ether is too high, people won't be able to power their apps and so the platform will stagnate and possibly fail over time.  So there is an incentive and real need to keep the cost of ether "affordable" and ether available.  Making ether inflationary is how you do that.  And indeed, it appears to be designed in that way.  So it won't compete with bitcoin on a fundamental level.  It will blow the doors off of bitcoin in terms of extensibility and this has me really excited.  I really can't wait to see how it turns out. :)

You are wrong to illustrate price and supply inflation as the same thing.  They are not the same thing.  One may result in the other in some cases but they are separate types of inflation that may or may not affect each other.

Against that?  Why not for that?  Why not seek to dethrone the bad apples through empowering the people by starting a not-for-profit mining company that answers to the foundation and its members in order to ensure the network and ensure dialogue?  You cannot ensure dialogue and your reply to is pure fantasy as the players you have mentioned have no reason to speak to you(assuming you even knew who they are in order to initiate contact).  Especially if you seek to neuter the foundations efforts to lobby and have any perceived power there.  They will cooperate with you if you can affect them or if you are one of them, especially if you're both.
  
Right now, mining is becoming more and more consolidated because of the public's inability to participate.  This needs to stop.  People need to be able to acquire mining resources to ensure parity.  The mining resources in terms of cloud mining need to be open and transparent, the cost of building ASICs and delivering them needs to be open and transparent and built around sustaining that process and not around lining individuals pockets.

This has nothing to do with fractions.  You're confusing yourself.  This has to do with how the protocol is coded.
  
A satoshi is the smallest transferable unit of a bitcoin.  This does not change if you make it more divisible, you just get more of them(inflation).  Right now a satoshi is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin but it could easily be 1/200,000,000th of a bitcoin if we change the code to double the smallest unit that comprises a bitcoin.

That doesn't really have anything to do with the price\value of ether over time.
  


  
I'm not sure what you mean by tied up to a universal value.
  


  
Exactly!  This will drive up the price of ether over time if the supply is fixed and that will affect the cost of running apps\scripts.  If ether is too expensive(valuable), people won't use it for anything other than a store of value and this will undermine the platform and dumb it down to just another alt coin with very expensive extensibility built-in.  And then it will have to compete\overcome bitcoins network effect(small jab at Vitalik here).

Ethereum needs the bitcoin price to stay steady right now so that they can fund ethereum developement, so this is not good for Ethereum.
  
Ethereum is fundamentally different than bitcoin and will not compete with it if it is designed as described.  The Ethereum platform is driven by ether or gas.  Ether cannot be a limited supply like bitcoin or the platform will fail because no one will be able to power their scripts.  People holding it like bitcoin works against the platform.  In order for your apps to run on ethereum, you need to have ether to keep them running, if the price of ether is too high, then slowly apps will fail for a lack of gas.  If the price is low, the platform will thrive as people will be able to power their apps and run scripts.  The price will be controlled and influenced in order to ensure the platform, not the price.  This makes ether fundamentally different than bitcoin and so, it will not compete with bitcoin.  It will complement it.  I cannot envision a scenario where etherium can succeed in the long term with a fixed supply of ether.  It must be inflationary in order to succeed over time.
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:38:14

There you go misunderstanding things, you seem to be trying now.  **A satoshi is the smallest transferable unit**.  This does not change if you make more of them.  Think of a satoshi as a 1.  The code will allow you to transfer a minimum of a 1.  If you change the code to introduce more 1's to a bitcoin, you haven't changed anything in terms of the value of that 1 in terms of its usability on the network.  It's still just as usable as it was previously, but we may collectively determine its monetary value is less or more.  And you certainly need more of them in order to equal 1 bitcoin so it is likely we would collectively agree on a different monetary value, but the network will still let you send that 1 satoshi just like before.  **Because a satoshi is the smallest transferable unit**.

The technical infrastructure of bitcoin is supported by the community, not by a centralized power structure like the bitcoin foundation.  The biggest threat to bitcoin is centralization of the mining infrastructure but you make no mention of mining or ensuring parity there.
The Bitcoin Foundation should not seek to have power over the core devs as you are building a system that can be abused by others when you vacate office.  
  
How will you ensure that decisions are made by the community and not the BF?

If the power crisis continues communities will pool their resources to create hot spots where they can charge devices and connect to the internet using a myriad of solutions.  We've seen this before in developing nations in Africa.  People will go to these hot spots to do business.  The hot spots will usually use alternative power like solar, hydro and wind to generate their electricity.  Telephone infrastructure generally works in blackouts and dial-up would be the first and most affordable solution for the hot spot but they can also pool together for satellite internet.  The blockchain is already being delivered by satellite by blockstream(for free) so staying in sync is not a problem, broadcasting transactions will be the hurdle and that's what hot spots solve.

You need to consider that all of your arguments boil down to obfuscation and this is irrelevant in terms of compliance and enforcement.  Exchanges are risk averse and obfuscation will not help you if the taint is high enough.  For instance if you mixed coins with one of the two Bitcoin addresses the US Treasury has blocklisted it would be impossible for an exchange to give you any benefit of the doubt.  You never know what addresses and when they could be considered tainted too adding even more uncertainty.  I'm not aware of any feature in Wasabi wallet that will prevent one of those addresses from mixing with it too so there really is no protection or even effort in that regard.

Hey, that's better!  But I did make it a point to limit my comment strictly to privacy.  The tradeoffs you mentioned are there specifically because of its strong privacy and we can work on those problems as we move forward.
   
Also, Bitcoin privacy is really easy to fuck up.  One mistake can have bigger implications than just that one transaction. 
   
Also, Taint.  I know you like to ignore this one because it is opaque and not easily enumerated in terms of its impact but the potential is there when using coinjoin.

That is technically true.  But with monero every transaction is structured the same so none of them stand out from each other, and monero does a lot to obfuscate and hide data on its blockchain, unlike Bitcoin.  The coinjoin is forever enshrined on the blockchain for all to see.  So while a coinjoin may be difficult to impossible to track on the day you make it, that won't always be the case and there is potential for them to be de-anonymized as time goes on and data is collected.

This is the side of truth.  We don't embrace the baseless conspiracy that they do.  That is the main difference.  Take this comment in the thread you linked for example:
  


  
It's complete bullshit.  "Old timers" like myself are here and we do not mainly support BCH.  Most of us don't support it at all because as old timers we recognize that it doesn't bring anything new to the table and large blocks alone can't scale to meet a global demand that doesn't exist.  The part about blockstream is bullshit too, they are a company that is adding to the space and they don't control communications at all.  They are "old timers" and they pay some of the core developers so they have a salary and can continue to focus on Bitcoin development but this doesn't give them control of Bitcoin.  Blockstream is the core of their argument against Bitcoin and it is a boogeyman they created that isn't a boogeyman at all.  Blockstream is their scapegoat for why they aren't on top and uninformed people fall for it.

You need to make sure your traffic won't route if the VPN connection is interrupted.  Some clients have this feature built in where you can tell it what app to allow/disallow if the VPN connection is interrupted and there are ways to configure a network interface to only be usable with the VPN depending on OS.  You basically want to make sure it is impossible for you to connect to binance without the VPN.  Because if you don't, sooner or later it will happen.

The first thing I came to understand about Bitcoin and its value to humanity is its ability to solve issues of trust.  You can talk about all of the parts that come together to make that happen but at the end of the day it boils down to trust.  This is something humanity has spent millennia working on.

In the future we will see daily swings bigger than todays price but it won't matter because the price.  Volatility is one of the things attracting people to Bitcoin and it needs to continue if it is going to attract new people.  There are plenty of other stable investments if you want a hedge against the volatility.

You obviously don't transact using Bitcoin.  The fee is not a static thing and zero fee transactions are processed all the time.  You can pay as much or as little as you want, it all comes down to what you need to do and how much you are willing to spend.  The average fee to reliably get into the next block right now is about 30 cents.  That can go up or down depending on various factors.  I have never spent more than a dollar for a transaction and I have done hundreds of zero fee transactions(because I wasn't in a hurry).

That's an interesting way to describe attempted fraud.  "Botched" is something I would use for a cooking recipe gone wrong, not an attempt to trick people into thinking you are someone you aren't by faking proofs and getting caught.  Your tolerance is unwarranted.
  
I appreciate your attempt to walk the line of truth.  But your tolerance allows him to perpetuate his fraud and I will not show tolerance where it hasn't been earned.  He has done nothing and demonstrated nothing that earns him tolerance.

That's not really how you worded it though.  And there is enough evidence to form an opinion on Ross's innocence regarding various activities and charges.  I feel there is a lot of room for Ross to garner sympathy and I think he would be better served as time goes on if we all just embraced the facts and worked towards getting him out.  He's never going to get a pardon if he doesn't clear the air and show that he has learned from what he has done and has changed.

Why would they take a massive dump?  The median transaction value is less than half of what they propose to track.  Exchanges also have no tools to verify the destinations identity.  You think exchanges are going to suddenly stop allowing transactions out for over a certain amount?  We are nowhere near a climate where that would happen.  It would seriously impact the industry and go against those same agencies repeated stance that they are taking a do no harm approach to regulation.  It would also work against the intent of the proposed regulation and force people to go p2p instead of using an exchange thus working against the intent for greater transparency.  This would go to the courts and I don't think the regulators want to be tested like that so we will end up with uneven regulation of whatever is proposed.

This!!!  The very people here trying to obfuscate the facts in order to gain sympathy for Ross could be gaining a lot more sympathy by acknowledging the facts and suing for forgiveness.  The facts are that he was brilliant, egotistical and naive.  He was in his 20's, pushing the boundaries of society and making mistakes in the process.  Mistakes that ultimately didn't result in the death of anyone.  Mistakes that can be forgiven.  There is so much to learn from Ross's story that is simply denied by siding with lies and conspiracy.  I want to see Ross free and speaking about what happened in its entirety so we can all learn and grow from it so it is really frustrating watching the fake news crowd do their thing.

They didn't.  They didn't need to because it would have just been a bigger case to deal with and they already had enough to put him behind bars.
  
But since he was being tried for kingpin charges, they did show the evidence for the attempted murders at his trial in order to show the lengths he was willing to go in order to protect his empire.  People who defend Ross like to say that "he was never convicted of murder" which is true but it ignores the fact that we all saw the evidence at his trial and that evidence convicted him of what he was charged with.

This won't be evenly enforced and only applies to countries that follow FATF recommendations.  I went looking for the actual text and there isn't one.  June 21st is the date FATF releases the recommendations.  There's still a lot of talk to happen after that.  The bloomberg article discusses proposed aspects of the system and it already presents major hurdles.  Coinbase makes a good argument that it may work against the intent of what they know already.

I sympathize with him and I can forgive him for what he tried to do but I need to see him acknowledge it.  Acknowledging it and apologizing for it shows that he has learned from it.  People change and grow as time goes on and Ross is young enough to do a complete 180 degree turn from his past decisions.  A tell all book by Ross could bring a lot of people to his side, way more than those who won't support him because they can't forgive or don't want to.  When you wrap in all of the decision making and emotion that went into the decision of whether to kill or not, it is an extremely compelling story.

Something like what you describe wouldn't be enough, the exchange would see the mass sends and just confiscate what they received with no impact to their customers.  It's people using mixers that tie their hands due to their low population.  We would need to get everyone using mixers/coinjoin or make it a default in the protocol to tip the scales.  The people I see pushing coinjoin appear to be fighting a war and they don't necessarily care about collateral damage.  This is a valid tactic and I support it to a degree but I don't think victory is realistic until there are ways to break the link.  Side-chains are a real possibility for tipping the scales.  We are close.

You are not going to be going back in time and faking wire transfers and bitcoin transactions, especialliy bitcoin transactions.  Ross kept everything so they had all of his chat conversations regarding hits and the payments for them as well as individual testimony to corroborate what was said in chat logs.  In addition he kept a journal further corroborating it all.  You aren't faking that.  And they had this type of evidence for everything he did, not just hiring hits.

None of the hits happened.  I'm not excusing what he did but it is a very complicated situation where the perpetrator was disconnected from the crime and the normal life of a criminal.  He didn't live the life of a criminal even though he did criminal things.  He had no face to face contact with anyone under him which is pretty much unheard of for a criminal of this level when dealing with their network.  A lot of this has to do with the digital medium he used to perpetuate the crimes but when you look at him objectively, you need to consider the disconnect that must have been there for him due to it all being online and digital.  There's a lot of reason to look at it and question whether Ross himself saw it all as "real".  Especially when you consider the technology he employed to create his network was perfectly legal and legitimate tech just never used before in this way.  It's all very surreal and complicated and not easily distilled down to "he's a drug dealer" or "he's a murderer".  He was a lot of things but technically the first of his kind in many ways with no precedent for him to compare himself to.  And he had no real life in person contact with anyone who could coach him on or talk to him about his decisions.

This is my problem with how people defend Ross.  People blindly support him and they are willing to completely dismiss evidence that was corroborated in many ways, including individual testimony in favor of conspiracy backed by zero evidence.  You give more weight to your imagination than corroborated evidence.
  
My biggest problem with this approach is that it doesn't help Ross.  People who are familiar with the evidence and know the facts of the case are radicalized against Ross's case for freedom because of the lies being used to seek his freedom when honesty and forgiveness would work.  No one died because of Ross's mistakes and it is perfectly reasonable that we can all forgive him for trying.  People can redeem themselves and Ross needs a chance for redemption but he won't ever get it with lies.

They really aren't equivalent since this is a Bitcoin sub.  This is a place to talk about and promote Bitcoin related topics.  Bulls also have history on their side since we can look at the last decade of price action and see that it has always gone up with its cycles.  In the face of that, Bearish talk should be justified and backed up by data.  Otherwise it's just antagonistic and unproductive to the reason most people are here(to talk about and promote Bitcoin).

One thing they can't control is the issuance.  With precious metals, they can buy up mines and simply mine or not mine.  Players can collude to do this on a global scale and use financial instruments to suppress the price in conjunction.  But with Bitcoin they cannot control the supply.  So sooner or later they will fail to control the price and Bitcoin will dictate what happens.  That's the point.  Bitcoin is not beholden to anyone and beholden to everyone at the same time.  Bitcoin is not your typical revolution.

Just because Satoshi didn't talk about SoV more than payments doesn't mean anything.  What matters is what made it into the design of Bitcoin and SoV is a big part of that.  All we need to understand Satoshi's intent is to look at the design he implemented.  There is arguably more to discuss revolving around implementing payments when building Bitcoin than there is SoV so it just makes sense it would be discussed more.  Supply and demand driving value is pretty well established and there isn't a whole lot to talk about and even less to code.

Which he kept a local copy of on his laptop because he thought some day it would all come in handy when they made a movie about him.
  


  
The allegations where corroborated during his trial.  There was no reason to pursue the charges when Ross is locked up for life already with no chance to appeal.  Our judicial system already has enough crime to punish that they don't need to seek punishment when it will have zero bearing on his freedom.  There were many laws that Ross broke and was never tried for or charged with.
  
The rest is conspiracy and I'll just say that I don't think you are helping Ross by pushing conspiracy.  His over the top sentence is enough that you may be able to get him a pardon some day as long as you don't muddy the air with conspiracy that puts people off.

While flawed in a lot of peoples eyes, the current system gives our government a lot of freedom and control over USD.  They aren't going to give up that control.  They aren't going to back the US Dollar with a global commodity that our adversaries can collude to manipulate.  That wouldn't be good for the security of the US and it might be bad for Bitcoin.  It might be a poison pill for Bitcoin because governments would attack it at the state level to undermine the Dollar.

There's a lot of misunderstanding in your reply, I'll assume it is not malicious.
    


  
Like I said, you can only obfuscate(obscure) it.  Saying that "no one can tell" is actually a lie because you can't know who can tell and since it is all there on the blockchain, there's a chance that someone can or will because the link between transactions is not broken.  And you ignored taint.  There is no taint with monero.
  


  
This is false.  Monero ring sets have nothing to do with the amount of users.  You aren't mixing with users because users don't control coins, they have access to spend amounts.  You don't have to rely on people using it to create a monero transactions like you do with a Bitcoin coinjoin.  You could be the only person on earth creating monero transactions and you would still have no problem.
   
Lightning and 2nd layer is literally the only hope for privacy with Bitcoin.  And at that point, you aren't getting your privacy from the Bitcoin blockchain.  Which is why there is hope.

That is not true at all.  Wasabi does not remove a coins history, it obfuscates it on a transparent ledger in a way that makes it hard to prove which coins you started with - "plausible deniability".  If you mix with tainted coins you can end up with tainted coins and an exchange can issue prejudice against you.  They aren't going to take chances and will just shut you down.

That's because the evidence for the murders was presented at his trial and taken into consideration when sentencing.

Go find minerjones on bitcointalk.org and ask him if he can find you error coins for sale.  He'll find you them for sale and graded.  It's safe to assume that most coins are in strong hands at this point so you're right in a sense but everyone has a price or a time they need to sell and new buyers are rarer and rarer as the price of Bitcoin goes up.  It's a lot of risk to buy a physical Bitcoin.  And the security features on the original coins is lacking compared to later offerings with better holograms, minting and melted hologram edges.

You would just be tainting peoples coins.  It can still be traced and an exchange isn't equipped to investigate and get to the bottom of it, they are just going to shut down accounts that end up with some of the coins because they are risk averse and can't take the chance.

Burden or not the metal is fungible.  I never claimed it was a good currency even though it is good money.
  


   
  
If I send monero to Kraken, they cannot see the history of my coins and apply prejudice based on that history.  They cannot even see the real address that sent them.  
   


   
And I agreed that privacy is a spectrum, privacy is a necessary component in achieving fungibility.  Wasabi does not achieve it.  It would need to remove all taint and the only way to do that is to make it so that a coins history cannot be traced and Bitcoin is completely traceable on the blockchain.

That really is an assumption on your part.  Just because you aren't hearing about it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  The whole reason you heard about this is because the altright decided to use it as an excuse to attack YouTube and recommend other platforms because YouTube de-platformed some of their people.  Go look at any of the threads about it and you'll find the_donald users serving up conspiracy theories and trying to push people to other platforms.
  
If you're YouTube and trying to clean up certain content, you're not going to do it manually.  You're going to automate it because it will be easier to unban videos that accidentally got caught up in it when the content creator complains than it would be to do the clean up manually.

I didn't say anything about character, I said he has a reputation for fraud.  And there is plenty of evidence to support this claim.  Another reason Wright won't pursue a case is because in the UK it is up to the defendant to make their case and if they win, they can sue for fraud.  So not only will the defendant have the opportunity to prove Wright has committed fraud(or tried to) he will then be able to sue Wright for fraud.

Most exchanges won't tell you why they are shutting down your account.  And I guarantee you that Coinmama will no longer be doing it too.  It's going to take a lot of people getting shut down who then turn to social media for us to connect the dots when it is happening.  I don't think it is happening yet except in extreme cases with high scores but the framework for oppression has been built and the potential is there.

Bitcoin isn't even close to as private as monero.  Coinjoin does not hide tx amounts or use stealth addresses.  There is no way to break a link between transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, you can only obfuscate it.  In addition you run the risk of tainting your coins with coins that authorities and exchanges are tracking and drawing even more attention to yourself.  The wasabi marketing around here has done a wonderful job of fooling you.

Nodes can handle 2MB blocks just fine, it's the bandwidth that is the issue.  Most people can participate on the network and run their own full node because currently the amount of data it will sync in one month is under most peoples caps.  Increasing the blocksize will push out a lot of users because the bandwidth needed to run a full node will be too much.  2MB blocks would force me to choose between running a full node that supports the network and doing all the other stuff I want to do.

In reality there are much less than 21 million Bitcoins.  People have lost access to their keys over the years or sent them to burner addresses in the early days.

I'm not really interested in discussing the shortcomings of fiat money because I am here partly because of those shortcomings.  I'm strict with the definition of fungibility because it is something I care deeply about.  It is a necessary property for "good money".  I already stated in this thread that it wouldn't matter if everyone used coinjoin but that isn't realistic at all.  My issues aren't with coinjoin itself, I think it's neat, it's with the way wasabi is marketed to users because most won't know any better.  The end.
@_date: 2019-04-16 19:35:16


  
This is a legitimate problem and just because you aren't hearing about it more doesn't mean it isn't happening or that it isn't going to get worse.  It is going to get much worse.  Taint analysis is happening and exchanges are making decisions based on it.  Taint isn't a static thing either, it can be applied at any time retroactively.  Your taint from just doing a coinjoin(all other taint aside) might be low enough to not be punished by the exchange and then the next day they decide to make coinjoin taint scores higher and fuck everyone who has ever received coins within X hops of the coinjoin.  It's a nice idea that if everyone used coinjoin then exchanges would be powerless but it is not realistic and you are playing with fire.
@_date: 2019-04-16 19:20:22


Coinjoin increases your taint and introduces the possibility for even more taint.  Imagine you are not a gambler and you're just some guy who thinks using wasabi makes your coins private.  You then mix your coins with a bunch of actual gamblers and then send your coins to Coinmama.  Since your coins are now mixed with gamblers coins, you have their taint and since Coinmama can't conclusively say which coins are really yours, they are just going to shut you down and not take the chance with you.  Coinjoin just gives you plausible deniability but exchanges aren't interested in wasting time on getting to the truth.

I'm sick and tired of the scammy way this wallet is marketed.  Wasabi relies on people not being able to trace transactions on a totally transparent ledger.  It does not provide true privacy where the transactions are hidden, it provides plausible deniability and simply being in the position where you are shaping your denial proves you do not have privacy.  This wallet doesn't give you fungibility like their website claims, it actually increases the chance your clean coins will become tainted.

Not true at all.  But I grew up with it and was born at the right time and place.  We used to have meetups through the 80s and 90s where a lot of what has happened was discussed.  Including "electronic money".
  
Also "Dark Web" is basically what the internet was when it started and for many years.  I don't remember the name of the publication but we used to rely on printed indexes of bulletin board systems to connect to sites and share content.  If you lived in Santa Clara County, California in the early days it was hard to not be exposed to computers.  My elementary school had one of the first programming classes for my age group in the world and they taught us BASIC on Radio Shack computers with 5.25" floppy discs to load the OS every time you started the computer.  People were also tuning in to watch us play competitive video games in the 90s with Team Fortress Classic when they implemented the capability.  We didn't get paid but it was easy to see the direction it was all going.  Things like IRC exposed us to the potential for real time social networking on the internet(Shout out to OG GamesNET!).

I never claimed physical cash was fungible so I'm unsure how it is relevant here since it is a totally different system than our blockchain.  But since you bring it up it is effectively fungible since there is no way for merchants to discern one note from another.  Lists of bad serial numbers are not held by merchants that can be used to apply prejudice.  Banks do not scan my cash and compare it to a list when I deposit it.  As long as our ledger stays totally transparent we will inevitably arrive at a time where taint is calculated in real time by anyone who wants to or by those who must due to regulation.

I disagree.  
  
Your argument is that if someone uses your hashing power for something you disagree with then you are not a miner.  There's a lot wrong with that but the main problem is that a pool has no power without its participants.  Everyone participating is agreeing with how blocks are being constructed or they would opt out.  If they don't they are relinquishing control of their hash power and that still doesn't mean they are not miners because they can change their mind at any time.

The files were not corrupted.  Very competent forensic investigators with the FBI were in control the data from the moment Ross was apprehended since the laptop was literally snatched from him while he was distracted.  The contents of the laptop like the chats, logs and diary he saved was corroborated in many ways.  From wire transfers to eye witness testimony.

You're being too liberal with the word "they" so I am not going to waste my time.  I love a good conspiracy but I do not see one on the side that apprehended and convicted Ross.  I do not subscribe to the notion that corruption on the law enforcement side by individuals acting on their own at all absolves Ross of his actions.  As someone who subscribes to libertarian ideals I feel he should take responsibility.  And he largely has, maybe too much.

I would be a supporter of his if he did things differently.  But I don't know what would have happened if the defense was allowed to call in the corrupt agents.  They weren't connected with the team that found and apprehended Ross and there is no evidence they ever knew who Ross was so I still side with the record.  The real problem I wish was the focus is our criminal justice system that isn't built to serve reform.

I am approving nothing and if you look at my history you will see that I do not agree with the sentence.  I side with the evidence, evidence that is well corroborated and I am very familiar with the case so I am firm in my position that Ross tried to have people killed.  The corrupt agents and their actions do not in any way justify Ross's own decisions which Ross documented very well.  You choose to ignore the evidence in favor of conspiracy and cling to "innocent until proven guilty" and that's fine.  Just don't expect me or anyone else to side with you.

So your assertion that a whale pumped the price is bogus.  One because you can't know what caused the spike and two because the price wasn't pumped, this is a single spike.  It's more likely people were liquidated or fat fingered a trade.  Or someone just bought a lot of Bitcoin all at once.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:23:09
The evidence came from his laptop and was introduced during his trial and corroborated in multiple ways.  Regardless of who was on the other end, Ross intended to kill people and even thought he had succeeded.  He then ordered another.  The evidence introduced was used to convict him of other charges and also was used to help justify such a harsh sentence.

Ross Ulbricht is not influential, let alone the second most influential, that is simply delusional.  He is not influential because he spent his credibility a long time ago and lost his voice in the process.  He didn't just build a website, he built and empire - an empire built on drugs with no regard for human life.  He never once did anything good with his money.  He never tried to help others.  He never expressed a desire to do so.  He was selfish and used his power to try and kill people over money.  He took a cut of every sale on a platform he built and had sole control over.  He could have taken the high road a dozen times.  He could have shown regard for human life.  He could have tried to help others.  Instead he only tried to help himself under the banner of libertarian ideals.  Ross Ulbricht is a fraud.
  
All of that being said: everyone can change and our criminal justice system is not good at allowing people to change.  Instead they are usually hardened by their experience and given no alternatives or reasons to change.  Ross has no reason to change with his current sentence.  What he needs isn't a pardon, he needs a reformed criminal justice system that will promote his personal growth and allow him to demonstrate a willingness to change and a path to freedom for doing so.
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:54:16
I don't think that is really true.  I used to check the listings from time to time so that I was familiar with what was going on and I don't recall ever seeing weapons and killers.  Ross did try to have people killed but he didn't find them from listings on Silk Road.

He did face charges.  The charges were dropped after he was already sentenced to double life with no chance for parole because there was non need to waste tax payer money seeking additional sentencing that make no difference.
  
Also, the evidence he tried to have people killed was introduced at his trial and corroborated.  That is the trial that convicted him.

Coinbase most certainly can help you whether they support it or not.  If it is a significant amount of money you should consider legal action.  There is no one that can help you other than Coinbase.
What I find interesting is that for some reason you were intending to send bcash to yourself and "mistakenly" sent it to a Bitcoin address.  This makes no sense whatsoever and the only thing I can imagine is that somewhere in your brain you thought you could scam Coinbase by turning less valuable bcash into more valuable Bitcoin.  Just speculation on my part but your actions really don't make any sense if you are telling the truth.

@_date: 2015-03-14 17:35:28
This isn't meant to be an all-in-one solution for how you store and use your coins.  It is a demonstration of what BIP38 can do.  By creating a BIP38 wallet with a strong password and uploading it to multiple services.  You have ensured that you can access it anywhere in the world with an internet connection and that it will probably be around and available to you for decades to comes with little effort on your part.   The internet is good at being persistent.
  
You can take it further by obfuscating the fact that it is even a BIP38 wallet which will slow or eliminate when it starts to be attacked.  When I started using BIP38 wallets to do cold storage, I found myself wanting to separate them geographically.  At some point I realized I could just use the internet and the multitude of services that do nothing but host, present and backup your data.  Long live the internet.  
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:22:44
I have a few different ideas.  One of them is doing a movies theme where you won't be brute forcing the password.  You'll have to find symbols and characters based on clues in specific movies.

This is what I used too, I'd love to hear what used and more about his methodology.
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:33:39
Yep, and it would still be there without hints!  I am convinced that BIP38 is the way to go for transportability\accessibility.  Using steganography, you can hide a BIP38 wallet in plain sight and access it anywhere in the world from an internet connected computer or a picture on your phone.
  
For instance, the image on imgur that I uploaded a year ago could have a completely different BIP38 wallet hidden inside. :)
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:29:46
I'm not aware of any but I am considering doing another.  I have an idea for a wallet with a password related to a theme.

I thought people would have picked up the heart since I replied with only &lt;3 to the first person who stated they were trying to crack it in the original thread.  I thought for sure it was going to get cracked way back when cscottnet posted try  with 3 of the 4 characters.  Just goes to show how different everyone thinks.  You did good by remembering it was memorable and omitting any foreign languages.  I also tried to make it clear that it could be guessed quicker than it could be brute forced, but I don't know how helpful that was.
  
I'm working on a new one but I want to make sure I plan it out a lot better this time around, I didn't think the first one through well enough and I got a lot of shit for it.
Congratulations again and thanks for playing! :)
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:35:11

FCC regulations are not going to change the behavior of ISPs.  What is the FCC going to do when they investigate a complaint?  They are going to fine the offender if they can prove they intentionally violated regulations and proving such a thing is not a simple matter.  There are all kinds of ways to create internet fast lanes and feign ignorance when it comes to routing traffic.  From rouge employee to faulty equipment and configurations.  ISPs will continue to do what they want, when they want.
Meanwhile, the FCC needs a bigger budget to meet their new mandate.  ISPs will lie and say they need tax breaks and more power so they can provide equal bandwidth for all.  Consumers are going to get screwed and any fines ISPs end up paying will be nothing compared to the money and power they gain.

I think the whole suit stems from Wrights lies to begin with.

And how was Bell able to get started with this monopoly?  Federal Regulation in the form of the Patent System.  It's much more nuanced than that, but there you have it, federal regulation allowed one company to get started with zero competition allowed.  And later when it expired, the federal government agreed to allow them to own 85% of the market.  Hardly a fair comparison to what we were discussing here since it started as a monopoly.

They'll just get the money other ways now.  Raising rates and asking for tax incentives is one way.  It's important to be open minded and consider that targeted degradation of service isn't solely about getting more money from the target.
  


  
Show me an example of a market coming under federal regulation that did not result in more consolidation and bigger monopolies.  I can't think of one.
  


  
The Federal government isn't the only entity that handles tax incentives.  They can come from your local municipality and your state.  I believe they will get very low cost loans(free money) out of the federal level anyways.
  


  
I didn't claim anyone would be complacent about it.  I said it would be hard to prove it was on purpose and even if they did, the fine won't matter.  And again, there are more reasons than just trying to extort more money directly from the likes of Netflix.  Stifling competition comes to mind...

Breadwallet generated your seed so you are still exposed the risk that they generated weak or predetermined keys.

BIP38 is still the cheapest/strongest way to do cold storage.  I have had BIP38 addresses funded and exposed to the internet for 6+ years and they are still going strong.  I can access them from anywhere in the world with an internet connection and spend it.
  
I once ran a contest on this sub back in 2013 where I created a BIP38 wallet with a 4 character password and invited people to throw BTC at it to compel people to try and crack it.  About a year later I started giving hints to help narrows the search space and it was finally cracked when I narrowed it down enough for them.  Had I not helped, I am positive it would still not be cracked.

This one is easy for me.  I had 100% of my savings in Gold.  Over the last month or so, I have been converting it to bitcoin and I am glad I did.  The price of Gold has dropped while the price of bitcoin has skyrocketed.  At some point I plan to shift some percentage back to Gold.  But not before Gold takes a further hit from people like me.  Bitcoin is very attractive and easily understood as a store of value for people already familiar with gold.  Bitcoin solves a lot of problems inherent in Gold while still being susceptible to SHTF scenarios.  Gold will always win for that.  But if you didn't hold it to begin with, you weren't ready for SHTF so bitcoin is no different while having way more potential.

If you have buys and sells in such a short amount of time, it's very possible that you were flagged for trying to use them as an exchange, they are not an exchange.  Did you have enough funds in your account to cover all transactions or were you depending on certain sells going through before buys?

Here's a possible way that he has hidden some of his priv keys:
  
Step 1) physics book or similar publication that is riddled with numbers and letters throughout.  
  
Step 2) highlight your key using an invisible marker and a pattern you can memorize.
  
Step 3) come back later with hand held black light to retrieve some or all of your keys.
Even if you were drugged, you couldn't disclose your private keys.
    
Now that you have the formula, all you have to do is read through the Ross Ulbricht story to figure out the likely place he would have done this.  Now good luck sifting through all of those books and figuring out his pattern.

People around here are going to feel really dumb once they figure out what this actually means.
  
China has created the path to accepting bitcoin by businesses and now business are in the process of adjusting to follow this path.  Part of that adjustment is pulling back their original plans that don't match the State approved path.
  
In order for a merchant to sell to a consumer in China today; they need to work with an approved virtual commodities exchange to handle the conversion.  China is a communist country and it seems that many people here are forgetting this.  It is not a free market.  The State controls the market and they have created a framework that allows bitcoin to exist within their systems of control.  This is good for bitcoin but bad for the individual freedom of Chinese citizens as the short term hope that bitcoin offered to break free from the State controlled financial system has been squashed.
  
You can expect many many businesses in China to partner with an exchange like BTCChina to sell consumers good and services in the coming months.
  
What does that look like?  Well let's say you want to buy a refrigerator in China using some of your bitcoins because bitcoins are worth more now than when you bought them effectively allowing you to buy that refrigerator for a lower out of pocket cost to you.  When you checkout, you will send BTC to the stores BTCChina exchange account and then walk out of the store with your item.  That is where the transaction ends for the consumer.  The department store will be able to cash out the BTC you just deposited in their VC account at their will.  Some will do it right away and some may hold.  
  
Why is this being mandated by the State?  Because China is a communist country and they want to track conversion.  They are doing it under the guise of stopping money laundering but there are probably many reasons for it.  Don't think for a second that the NSA isn't doing the same thing but without us knowing.  China is just open about it because they can be.  By making this mandate, china only has to watch the state approved exchangers instead of a million merchants.  Mom and Pop merchants will probably still accept BTC directly, but it will be under the table and at great risk to both parties if they are caught.
 
So there you go.  I hope this put yesterday and today into perspective for you.  Good luck!

The problem with a physical representation of bitcoins is you don't know how it was generated and how safe the private key associated with the representations are.  
  
You can already print paper bitcoins.  What we need is something that allows us to print our own bitcoins in an environmentally friendly way because the physical representation will be discarded after the funds are retrieved.  Because of the implications I described above, they will be retrieved right away.

Mining is not mature yet.  I would buy bitcoins now and wait until the mining market matures.  Then buy a miner, maybe even buy it with some of the bitcoins you bought with your 20k.

In response to your ELI5 question: Think of data flowing on the internet as little ships that have flags to represent who they are and what they do.  You have pirate flags and you have english and french and spanish flags.  Now imagine aliens show up and start floating around and decide they don't like the pirate flags because their much cooler than the other flags and they're jealous.  So the aliens decide to do something about those ships.  They can slow down the ships, blow up the ships and even change their flag or even the ships crew so it's a totally different ship.  As you can see, these aliens are pretty powerful and a bit scary; especially since they are the only ones who can sail the pirate flag now. ;)

In addition, they have 2factor authentication and have a live bounty available for people that can find bugs in their code.  They are open and aware to ideas that affect them and their customers.  I find value in this.
  
You can link your checking account and do transfers easily using their API.  I've done this on my computer, laptop, Cell Phone and PDA, without issue.
  
They are backed by well known VC and are located in the US.  By holding Bitcoin with them, you have a whole machine(that is growing) looking after your investment.  I'm sure they can do better than your average person.

People around here are going to feel really dumb once they figure out what this actually means.
China has created the path to accepting bitcoin by businesses and now business are in the process of adjusting to follow this path. Part of that adjustment is pulling back their original plans that don't match the State approved path.
In order for a merchant to sell to a consumer in China today; they need to work with an approved virtual commodities exchange to handle the conversion. China is a communist country and it seems that many people here are forgetting this. It is not a free market. The State controls the market and they have created a framework that allows bitcoin to exist within their systems of control. This is good for bitcoin but bad for the individual freedom of Chinese citizens as the short term hope that bitcoin offered to break free from the State controlled financial system has been squashed.
You can expect many many businesses in China to partner with an exchange like BTCChina to sell consumers good and services in the coming months.
What does that look like? Well let's say you want to buy a refrigerator in China using some of your bitcoins because bitcoins are worth more now than when you bought them effectively allowing you to buy that refrigerator for a lower out of pocket cost to you. When you checkout, you will send BTC to the stores BTCChina exchange account and then walk out of the store with your item. That is where the transaction ends for the consumer. The department store will be able to cash out the BTC you just deposited in their VC account at their will. Some will do it right away and some may hold.
Why is this being mandated by the State? Because China is a communist country and they want to track conversion. They are doing it under the guise of stopping money laundering but there are probably many reasons for it. Don't think for a second that the NSA isn't doing the same thing but without us knowing. China is just open about it because they can be. By making this mandate, china only has to watch the state approved exchangers instead of a million merchants. Mom and Pop merchants will probably still accept BTC directly, but it will be under the table and at great risk to both parties if they are caught.
So there you go. I hope this put yesterday and today into perspective for you. Good luck!

You are right and wrong at the same time.  The US Government could kill bitcoin, but not in the way you suggest.  They would have to attack it on the wire to stop it.

You can't do it without compromising what makes bitcoin so strong.  If your house gets robbed and someone steals your gold there is no one who is going to make that gold dissapear from the thieves posession and appear back into yours.  If it could happen, then the mechanism that made that happen might be too powerful and ultimately a weakness in the system.

Coinbase is your best option right now.  Keep in mind that you cannot buy coins again until after your first purchase clears and that can take up to 5 days.

Max has only tweeted once about Quark and that was to advertise the interview with Bill Still.  He tweeted right after the interview that aired today because it was recorded over a week ago.  Bill Still is the one talking about Quark and Bill is using it as an example of a coin that is  supposedly better.  Quark is indeed faster and supposedly more secure.  Bill even admits in the interview that he is not an expert and may be totally unaware that there are other coins out there just like Quark but on a different mining schedule.

It's no different than the millions of transactions that happen in cash every day.  In places like California, there are millions of migrant workers who do not pay taxes.  The farmers have their money on the books but when it turns into cash and is given to workers the trail stops there.
  


  
As long as that exchange did not report the sale to the US Government, they would have no way to know.  They can track how the funds move on the blockchain but can't know if money facilitated the transaction without an external data set.
  


  
In your example you mentioned the coins were bought through Coinbase.  Expect them to be subpenaed at some point since they are in the US.  Your transaction history lists how many BTC's you bought and for what price.  Simple math does the rest.  As long as you don't cash out using an endpoint they can monitor, you are fine.  I fully expect them to be required to report all buys\sells over a certain dollar amount to the IRS at some point.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:29:02
I know how the media likes to report this.  That has nothing to do with the fact that if Coinbase was hacked and lost 10% of their BTC on hand that you wouldn't have any way to know unless they told you.
Coinbase is structured in a way that you couldn't know.  Go look up any of the addresses you have used on Coinbase to receive BTC and will notice that the balance is zero.  You have no way to track the bitcoins that Coinbase holds for you outside of the API they have provided.  This is intentional.

I'm not arguing the tech or it's existence.  Just whether this ATM has the capacity to validate an ID.  And if it does validate IDs, I really want to know how that works and who it's talking to for the validation.  If it's just looking for the right fields to be filled out with the right type of data on a mag stripe, then that's something but in terms of actually helping to inhibit behavior, it's really nothing.

I did kind of ignore it, sorry.  Most people who have a bank account can link it to an online supplier of bitcoins and never leave their home, like coinbase for instance.  People who don't do that, don't do it for various reasons.  Reasons that can be accommodated by a local shop that's safe and secure yet allows them to transact using cash, thus helping to preserve their anonymity.  Anonymity being a big attractor for bitcoins.

It's interesting that I don't disagree with anything you said but disagree that Gold is broken.  The very reason it looks the way it does is because it's so strong.  What else could hold up to it and does?  Every other precious metal that is rare is the answer to that question.  None of the manipulation changes the fact that Gold is an excellent store of wealth.
  
And I have witnessed some compelling arguments over the years that point to gold being suppressed and undervalued.  I don't know what to believe except that 10k years of history backs up Gold.  The fact that Bitcoin holds it's own against Gold is incredibly flattering to everyone involved with the protocol.  These are exciting times! :D

It's more likely they will be ordered to turn over transaction history or report buys(people cashing out) over a certain amount.  This is low hanging fruit for them to go after for capital gains.  Because of these possibilities, I would only use Coinbase to buy and would only sell small amounts unless it was an emergency.

You're leaving out the fact that he did not get the coins when they were supposed to show up even though his account had been debited the ACH amount.

People around here are going to feel really dumb once they figure out what this actually means.
China has created the path to accepting bitcoin by businesses and now business are in the process of adjusting to follow this path. Part of that adjustment is pulling back their original plans that don't match the State approved path.
In order for a merchant to sell to a consumer in China today; they need to work with an approved virtual commodities exchange to handle the conversion. China is a communist country and it seems that many people here are forgetting this. It is not a free market. The State controls the market and they have created a framework that allows bitcoin to exist within their systems of control. This is good for bitcoin but bad for the individual freedom of Chinese citizens as the short term hope that bitcoin offered to break free from the State controlled financial system has been squashed.
You can expect many many businesses in China to partner with an exchange like BTCChina to sell consumers good and services in the coming months.
What does that look like? Well let's say you want to buy a refrigerator in China using some of your bitcoins because bitcoins are worth more now than when you bought them effectively allowing you to buy that refrigerator for a lower out of pocket cost to you. When you checkout, you will send BTC to the stores BTCChina exchange account and then walk out of the store with your item. That is where the transaction ends for the consumer. The department store will be able to cash out the BTC you just deposited in their VC account at their will. Some will do it right away and some may hold.
Why is this being mandated by the State? Because China is a communist country and they want to track conversion. They are doing it under the guise of stopping money laundering but there are probably many reasons for it. Don't think for a second that the NSA isn't doing the same thing but without us knowing. China is just open about it because they can be. By making this mandate, china only has to watch the state approved exchangers instead of a million merchants. Mom and Pop merchants will probably still accept BTC directly, but it will be under the table and at great risk to both parties if they are caught.
So there you go. I hope this put yesterday and today into perspective for you. Good luck!

I personally see all of these nooby duplicate posts as re-assurance that I have made the right decision buying bitcoins.  If this sort of thing stagnated and stopped all together, I would not take that as a sign that new people are coming on board.  Instead we are flooded and the timing perfectly coincides with some big media attention and some front page bitcoin posts.
Just relax and let it run it's course and embrace it for what it is: validation.
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:43:29
I'll admit that the effort probably outweighs the usefulness, but if it can be done, someone probably will.
  
Optical Recognition can be fooled and quality fake IDs are easily purchased anonymously.  The hardest part here is the hand.  Fake IDs aren't cheap and you are only getting 3k worth of btc per hand.  Once a hand is associated with a fake ID, you need to maintain that relationship or start over with new hand and new fake ID.  Not impossible but definitely not cost effective unless you control the whole scheme from production to finish.
  
And for what?  To avoid meeting someone in person to buy btc?  Probably not going to happen unless there is a large disparity between the price of btc at the atm and the price on the street.
  
It's fun to think about, though.
  
EDIT:  the whole things mute at this point anyhow, I just read that the ATM is being anchored **inside** the coffee shop, not outside.  Also, it's probably easier to just hire stiffs to come with you to the ATM once a week to do multiple transactions than it is to cheat the system.

You're ignoring the first quotes.  "Alternatives to the dollar" implies that it coexists with competing currencies.  To destroy the dollar implies that it no longer exists because it has been destroyed.  Ron Paul is talking about how history will view bitcoin under the circumstance of mass adoption, not what it will actually do.  Ron Paul is not a person that believes he can see the future.  Just how events can affect it.  This is a skill that comes with education and experience.  Ron Paul has both.

That's correct.  The Government has basically said that the Banks have their piece of the pie and that's what they get until the Government allows otherwise.
  
Right now they are going to grow the exchanges and promote cooperation between the merchants and the exchanges.  This is to make it easy to track conversion.  They are doing this for systematic control under the guise of tracking\preventing money laundering.
  
If they allowed every business to do the conversion, they would have an impossible job of tracking it.
  
Small businesses will still directly deal in BTC but they will do it at great risk.  Fear is a system of control that has served them well.

I would use localbitcoins to move a small amount like that.  There's a chance that someday coinbase is going to be subpoenaed and everyone who cashed out using them is going to get a letter from the IRS.

Since when does the buyer get to set the price?  It sounds like you're over complicating this.  Just straight up say in the terms of trade that the price is determined at the time of transaction using site X.

But a merchant would have to have a CoinKite terminal and pay fees in order to serve those people you know.  The whole appeal of bitcoin for merchants is eliminating fees.  Why would a merchant pay 0.06 btc a month to use this isolated ecosystem when they can do it for free using a tablet that serves anyone with bitcoin?

But he didn't do anything wrong and now he's being punished because a system enabled it.  This guy shouldn't lose his money because a bank can't keep their system safe but are only willing to assume less than all of the responsibility.  
  


  
Unless it's stolen money that's still in the bank, right?  Looks like in this case the banks stole it back and probably all colluded to enable that.

You can never steal more than 10% of the funds available on Coinbase.  In addition, if they were hacked to that extent, in order to keep their reputation intact, I doubt you would ever hear about a breach of that level.

It would be awesome if they allowed their early adopters to get in(with any amount(no lower limits)) on the price setting before they go public.

Because your argument is Satoshi dumping his coins not all early adopters dumping their coins.  You don't get to make this up as you go along.

I recommend: 
Seagate Recovery Services rock because they will perform a recovery and send you a text file of what they can recover.  If you don't see the files you are looking for, you can abandon the recovery and not pay for it.  But you don't get your HD back(I think).

The answer to your question is that it's just not going to happen.  There are only going to be 21 million bitcoins.  So the more widely adopted it is the more spread out it should become.  There will be addresses with large amounts, but no one will be buying them through an exchange.  The act of doing so would drive up the price and work against the buyer.  These deals will happen behind closed doors and we will likely never hear about them unless the act of hearing about them is a marketing stunt.  Otherwise it's not in either the seller or buyers interest to advertise their exchange.
If bitcoins are still around in 10 years; large sums of bitcoins will move slowly to a person or entity by way of multiple outlets in a manner that does not affect the price in an upward motion.
@_date: 2013-09-13 15:29:07
That's true.  And I'm not sure how upset I should be about bitcoins when there is a myriad of systems in place to aid donating anonymously, like super PACs.  But still, I don't see how more systems to aid in corrupting our public officials is a good thing.
