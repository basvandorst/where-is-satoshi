I've recently started writing a bitcoin payment method for the open source eCommerce shopping cart solution [nopCommerce]( It's ASP.NET (MVC) based with a MS SQL backend database. Let me know if you'd like to help.
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:47:30
Kinda. I already listed 15 ATMs and then used data from CoinATMRadar and Coindesk's Bitcoin ATM map together with emails I had received to add the ones I was missing.
I should have added a link to the page stating that some of the information was taken from CoinATMRadar. I'll add it as soon as I can.

I believe a lot of people choose Google Authenticator or Authy to perform 2FA, in which case no SMS messages or telephone calls are going out from the server to your device.
Also, if someone has access to the data you're talking about, I think the fact that they could possibly know your phone number is the least of your worries.

Definitely. It's such a shame. As soon as a UK bank plays ball we can move forward.

The server is $20/month, so 5 months.
I could probably run it on their $10/month server offering, but I wanted 2GB RAM for stability and to download the initial blockchain over torrent, so I opted for the slightly more expensive one.

Are you operating as a sole trader?
If so, I believe you should be recording the sterling value of the Bitcoins you receive as payment for your services (at the point the transaction takes place) and paying the correct amount of income tax for that sterling amount, regardless of whether you keep the Bitcoins or cash them out into fiat.

Which is great, but there is still a third party involved, profiting from the operations and dictating how the system works/can be used. Bitcoin is a protocol that is free of these ties and can be integrated into any system imaginable.

@_date: 2014-06-28 20:31:17
Thanks for your feedback.
I did know about Cryptopay but I remember seeing a post questioning their reputation with a lot of negative comments about them. I also contacted them to ask about their minimum settlement amount (because I couldn't find it mentioned on their website anywhere) and they didn't reply to me so I was a little put off. Having said that, their website looks like it has been updated so I'll make an account and see what their service is like.
I didn't know BIPS offered settlements in GBP, so thanks for mentioning them. I'll make an account there too and see what their service is like.
I'm writing a follow-up post with the responses I have received so I'll make sure I mention both of these.
@_date: 2014-10-17 15:27:31

@_date: 2014-12-23 11:06:23
True, mine too. That doesn't necessarily means it's a better option though.
My local deli has to charge 50p for transactions under £10 when using a debit/credit card and hasn't been offered an NFC enabled machine because their volumes are too low, but they can still accept bitcoin at a fraction of the cost without charging the customer.
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:01:48
From what I can see, BIPS doesn't appear to support GBP.
Cryptopay does seem to allow GBP settlements, but their website doesn't give me much confidence. Their FAQ says this:


...which isn't exactly well written, or clear.

I'm sick of posts saying "What is stopping *X* creating their own currency?"
Nothing (potentially) is stopping *X* from creating their own currency.
Hopefully, Bitcoin has provided *X* with an option that is better than the current system and requires little development on their part to incorporate.
Besides, haven't Google hinted at incorporating Bitcoin into Google Wallet already? [(source)](

The majority of Brits don't have to think about the costs associated with accepting payments online when using companies like Sage Pay.
I hoped for more of Simon Black, considering the influence Sage Pay has on the e-commerce market in the UK. The last thing Sage Pay want to do is stifle innovation.

At the moment Transferwise is probably the best option and I agree that people probably don't mind paying fees (especially when they have been reduced so drastically recently).
But wouldn't a (near enough) free system with no boundaries that can be integrated into any platform be a better option?

You may want to also post this in as I'm guessing you're targeting UK customers.
As for whether people would actually spend Bitcoins on their site if they did choose to accept it, all I can say is I already have several similar retailers (probably their competitors) listed on  that accept Bitcoins, which must indicate customer interest:

The day UK citizens get an exchange that allows easy deposits via a UK bank account is the day Bitcoin takes off for me here in the UK.
Once I have this I can start building merchant services on top of that exchange (if the exchange doesn't provide this themselves) and provide UK businesses with options in regards to accepting Bitcoin for their services with little or no financial risk to them (in the case that they want to be paid in fiat and not hold the Bitcoin).
At the moment, transferring money to exchanges such as Bitstamp and Kraken just doesn't work out financially viable for the volumes most of the small businesses anticipate.
I even have a credit distribution partner sorted, so distributing fiat to the businesses is not a problem.

He believes digital currencies/online payments are the way to go but doesn't like that we don't know the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto and that Satoshi Nakamoto could potentially make a lot of money.

As someone else pointed out there will be other full nodes hosted in the same data center if you host with DigitalOcean, which reduces the decentralised aspect.
I figured running a full node in a data center where there will be others is better than not running one at all.

I have used BitBargain, Bittylicious, LocalBitcoins, QuickBitcoin and Speedy Bitcoin and would recommend every single one.
I personally find Speedy Bitcoin the easiest (just make a bank transfer to their account using your unique reference) and usually the cheapest.
There are also a few more/different options listed at:

Nonce is a recognised term in cryptography. Has it stalled the adoption of SSL or TLS in the UK?
I would like to think that the type of people that want to understand bitcoin can overlook that a term mentioned in it's detailed description just happens to be the slang word for paedophile in one part of the world. If not, we're fucked.

True, but my bank charges £8 for SEPA payments so for me it isn't worth the hassle (when I can pay slightly over the odds and get the bitcoin within 5 minutes).
If you can make it economical to transfer money to an exchange such as Kraken or Bitstamp via SEPA or any other method that's probably going to be your best bet, but you usually have to wait a little for the payment to go through.

So far (1st member of the panel):
* Bitcoin has been used for illicit purposes but so has a lot of other payment methods/services
* Bitcoin accounts for only a very small percentage of money laundered
* Bitcoin is innovative
* Bitcoin should be regulated

I'm giving paper wallets to my brother, mother and father but I'm opting for a personal explanation over written instructions.
I think my computer scientist brother will already know the deal but my dad will definitely think of it as "magic internet money".

*Usually* the retailer has a QR code that you can scan using a wallet app on your smartphone. The retailer then checks their wallet (using a smartphone or computer) and verifies they have received the coins. Once they have received the coins they give you the goods.
