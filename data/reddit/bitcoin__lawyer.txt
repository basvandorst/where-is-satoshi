You can use your wallet or the blockchain as proof of when you received the bitcoin.  Your tax basis will be the current market value of the bitcoins when you purchased them. When you decide to sell, use your profit or loss to calculate your tax liability.  You will not be taxed on the amount you initially invest.

If/when the market bubbles pop, gov. backed currencies will be worth nothing.  You can't invest, if your money has no value.  The key is to invest and diversify now.  Especially if you foresee a currency crisis in the near future.  If you wait, you may be trading your million dollar house in for a fraction of a bitcoin.

Yep, lol.

Yeah, I dumped mine too. Over it.

What platform do you trade on?

It's just math. Everyone can agree on math. If the current protocol can't support more decimal points I think a soft fork would work.

The IRS treats bitcoin like property not as a currency. Therefore when you acquire the bitcoin you need to record the fair market value at that time. If you are buying the coins through an exchange the price you paid will be the fair market value. This is not a taxable event, but will serve as the basis for an event in the future. Taxable events occur when you dispose of your bitcoin by either selling or paying for something with it. At the time of disposition you need to determine fair market value again. Then you will be able to calculate your gains or losses. If you held the bitcoin for less than a year the IRS will treat any gains as short term and will be taxed as ordinary income. If you hold the bitcoin for more than a year you will qualify for long term capital gains tax treatment which is capped at 20%.
For anyone that is trading or using their bitcoins for purchases you need to record every transaction so you can file your taxes properly at the end of the year. If you use Coinbase they actually send out a Cost Basis tax report which will help you with your taxes. I believe other exchanges send out something similar.
I'm going to blog about this subject this weekend because it is very important. I don't want my fellow bitcoiners to get into trouble with the IRS. Which is very easy to do if you’re not thinking about it.

As for your situation.  You have one short term capital gain of 50 cents.  While your account is showing $103 this is not going to create a taxable event until you either sell or buy something with the bitcoin.

Remember that one bitcoin can be broken down to 100,000,000 satoshi. While bitcoin are rare in a sense, 21 million in total eventually, satoshi are abundant. Most likely in the future we'll deal in millibits and satoshi.

Exactly, it only looks like a surge when you're zoomed in on a 24 hour or weekly graph.

Broskee, keep your BTC. It's not worth trading in an appreciable asset for a home that is most certainly over priced from the current housing bubble. Wait for your next bonus or donate some plasma before letting your BTC go.
