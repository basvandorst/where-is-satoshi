I'm excited about Rand Paul's support and efforts to end the Patriot Act and all that jazz but can we talk about his social issues for a second?
If you just read through a few of these it becomes problematic really, really quickly. I'm excited as much as anyone for someone who supports bitcoin but we can't ignore one thing for a whole host of other issues.

I really hope you'll go through with this project! I write for a bitcoin site and I'd love to write a piece on this.

I may get downvoted for this but it's really, really risky to go all in with holdings in bitcoin. I'm a staunch proponent of bitcoin but every portfolio, regardless of perspective, should be diversified to minimize risk. That said, I'm a long term holder and I'd just suggest that one likely wouldn't want to only keep your holdings in gold let alone only bitcoin.

Just filled it out for you. Good luck with your thesis work!

Google this doesn't strike me as "don't be evil" in the least. A few months ago I mentioned bitcoin in a Google Wallet transaction note and got an email warning; it was a reminder to a friend 
Anyway, thanks for advocating and developing awesome stuff! $2 private

Thanks for a rational and reasonable reply to this thread! That said, we enthusiasts should perhaps advocate more and evangelize less.
