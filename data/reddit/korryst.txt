Fed meets on Wednesday to decide if they want to change the rate and we had a sell of because of that. Bitcoin is of course correlated to stock market and usually sells off before the Dow takes a dip.

Stock market correction is overdue, Bitcoin correcting. This article simply gives you an idea when stock market may follow +8 weeks. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:36:22
but my friend to say that Bitcoin is not correlated in any way to the stock market is also not true especially when it's a security at this point not a currency yet.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:49:31
I think so too but now it's still like in still before the storm

Here a lot of posts exactly look at Bitcoin dips. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:00:40
history repeats itself my friend. it always does.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:12:50
yeah right.

they have human nature in common. introducing greed.

In view of the Fed's rate increase that the Fed said would continue to raise further, the weaker dollar is the only way to avoid the market crash similar to the one that led to the Great Depression. If the dollar stays expensive we will surely have a crash. It's a policy trap. The risk is for the dollar to lose its reserve currency status now of course. Double edged sword. Here is a detailed perspective: [Trump, Fed, the Dollar and Bitcoin](

when transaction fees drop - buyers disappear.

Based on historical valuations. We can't entirely ignore this. But some do, of course. There are many indicators showing the end of the bull market. Nobody knows of course what happens next. Its a question of when not if.

wars, epidemics, empires rising and falling, economies booming and busting. cyclical movements everything has a cycle.

Just relax the Fed meeting tomorrow so it will bounce back after it.

It is a healthy pullback if you look at it from the perspective that I talked about in this reddit: [Remember Novogratz?]( but at that time I did not spot it correctly. But it was pump and dump now its clear.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:02:47
I do not think it is too late. more reason why it is not than otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:13:50
For now it looks like we got a V-bounce as in the past. Let's see if it gets sold within a few hours.

Coinbase jacked up fees and to get the money out of it to a bank account is cost prohibitive:

Basically LocalBitcoin is a very raw system and needs further work. People who use it and especially the newbies are basically scammed by the experienced users there. There is nothing that says Serve2Serve is risky there. And I know people personally who was scammed by this service. Unfortunately, this is NOT OK form the system to simply keep a blind eye to the complaint from new users who release bitcoins and then get scammed by experienced users there who understand very well that they can do it without any consequences. No blocks, no even negative reviews since transactions under $400 do not make it to the review section.

Look up the famous story about Isaac Newton's investment. He did exactly the same. And it was NEWTON! So don't be sad.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:43:52
You bet. But I think this dip isn't over.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:06:28
Buying on a dip takes a little more intuition then just buying period. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:59:29
Your post was actually spot on. I was surprised that the 2K was retested but Bitcoin likes to retest old lows. Now I am curious if 3K will be retested at some point.

To register on GDAX it says you have to be a professional trader. S it is not for everyone?

We are on our way to the $6K as far as I can see.

Time to go prepaid. Ditch all those banks and get a prepaid account. But even this is temporary solution as we will definitely see more of this sh***t from mainstream banks. Well, that's why we got Bitcoin in the pipelines dont' we? And good old fashioned gold coins. Remember Leprechaun? He was no fool to trust his pot of shiny gold to the banks.

All this dip buying may not be worth your nerves. I wrote a post about it: 
And I like this write up by Jason Jenkins (if you want a good technical summary):

You just go ahead and buy some on Coinbase using debit card or direct debit (your bank account). If you cannot wait, buy from someone else on LocalBitcoins. Bread Wallet also has an option to buy using your U.S. bank account.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:17:14
LOL. Look at you
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:18:42
Dome solid tips. Thanks.

Clearly was a window to buy this morning. But with Bitcoin I don't really think it's all that matters dip or no dip it's shooting to the stars.
