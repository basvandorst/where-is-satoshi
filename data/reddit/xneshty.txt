Yes, if we really want cryptocurrencies being adopted in our daily life, we first need to fully test it by having people attack the network. If it wouldn’t even hold against some spam, this is not where I want to be my money in.

Not going to defend the government here, the taxation often is simply ridiculous. I agree on this part with you, but regarding the robbery by printing more and more money making it worth less and less, I have to disagree.
Exactly this inflation - even if it‘s bad from the perspective of an individual, and some might be pissed by it - inflation is a basic element of the economy. Without inflation people wouldn’t spend their money except for stuff they need to ‘survive’ like food, because why would you spend 500 bucks for a new bed, if you can buy two beds for the same amount next year? We’ve seen this already in btc: “why use btc to buy a sandwich, if i could buy sandwiches for a whole week, just next week?”
Our economy would stagnate, it would stop. The circle of economy, meaning that if people don’t buy anything, companies won’t earn - companies will have to hand in one’s notice - people won’t earn money to spend it, would stall. The main question resulting from this issue is: would the deflation of any currency be enough, to maintain wealth across the population and keep the economy stable and growing?

I don’t think paying for dinner would be such a tremendous amount that any tax office would want to know what it was used for - beside the fact that the business who receives the money has to deliver the VAT. It’s about large amounts of money - and I believe you would know where a whole bitcoin came from into your wallet and why you received such a huge amount.

Before they allowed trading, people (mostlikely employees and people which reach out to these employees; maybe they sold the information) were informed that coinbase adds BCH to their repertoire. They bought BCH everywhere they could, price rose by 30%, then it was listed on coinbase, skyrocketing by factor 3-4, coinbase closed trading (while they are accused to allow trading/sell for some people), price dropped to 3000 again, now being available to everyone again.
In addition, they ereased all the information of this pump in their charts, one by one (day, month, 3 days,...)

I’m not saying people are stupid, nor does there have to be a ‘FORCE’. What I suggest to consider is that if money doesn’t loose in value, people will hodl it, instead of spending it. When someone wants or needs a new tv, he’ll buy it - but a large amount of people will double-think about a purchase, if they could get more for the same money on a later date. Not everyone, but a significant amount of people - enough to affect the economy.

Deflation means that value in a currency increases. Deflation affects the purchasing power.
If companies rise their price reasoning it by aligning the value rather the nominal number, the purchasing power stays the same. The price can affect the purchasing power as well.
So even if the purchasing power stays the same, it’s still a deflation.

Inflation in most currencies is not that huge, to stress people to throw their money away - in fact too much inflation can instantly kill economy as well, so government have to maintain a healthy inflation (2-3% / year)
People are all different, I don’t think theres a specific group of people who this applies to. In fact, consider the CPI, a basket of goods, which is compared each year to the previous years. With inflationary money, this CPI increases every year, meaning goods cost more each year. It’s a economic factor that you don’t feel in your daily decisions, but it does affect the economic on a long term.
Also, on another note, to maybe answer your question about which kind of people are affected, consider borrowing money. With low interest rates, borrowing money can be very appealing!
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:59:13
The effective purchasing power remains still, but the money will still earn in value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:33:45
I see, that definitely is a valid point. But this does not exclude fraudulent activities and insider trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:46:15
Yes, but since all information on coinbase charts was ereased couple hours later, I don’t know if there is still any evidence - people who sold probably won’t share this information, for obvious reasons.

If bitcoin fails before one other currency establishes, people will never accept a cryptocurrency.

The theory of this idea is really nice. But that’s only one side of the coin.
Deflationary money will benefit those who have already alot, so the gap between poor and rich can enlarge - if ie. companies raise their prices to align with the deflation, the poor then will loose even more.
It will also hinder research (ie. research for a better planet) since the economy is stagnating.
Companies won’t be able to borrow money to start off for a fucking mind blowing lroduct, because with deflationary currencies, borrowed money gets more expensive over time, instead of cheaper as with inflationary ones. Add the interest rates and you’ll end up without any progress in the economy.
I see where you’re coming from, consumption has escalated in the past decades, but deflationary currencies can result in more troubles than we have with inflationary ones right now. We don’t know what will happen, but it’s not generally better..

How you come to this conclusion? It makes more sense, that this was insider trading, rather than coinbase waiting for a pump to list BCH.
Obviously, because this is the first coin to be listed for a very, very long time. People expect that the price rises tremendously when it’s listed on coinbase. And BCH-whales might purchased large stacks, because hell it starts a pump and FOMO. Prople don’t want to take the initial price, they expect it to rise and **then** throw it down the market.
To some extend, and this now is sheer speculation, coinbase *could* also simulate a pump, in order to sell a small amount of bch for high price, in order to buy back alot at low price, thus increasing liquidity. This would also reasonate, why no other exchange had this pump and why they closed BCH trading, because coinbase might simply not have any BCH anymore to be purchased.

Good point, there are goods that loose in value over time, as well as goods which are overpriced but bought, because of ‘fashion’.
For the first, value of goods might decrease, so with a deflationary currency, either the price falls down tremendously quicker (making people aware to not buy the latest stuff), or companies will raise the price according to the deflation.
Fashion on the other side is not so predictable factor. Will ‘having the latest tech’ overweight the fact that you basically throw away alot of value in the future?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:56:59
That is true, this would be one possible outcome once and if deflationary currencies will find it’s way into our *real* economy, that I hope to be true.

On the other hand, it will be a pain in the arse to gather the sum of all addresses, when you have to enter 60-100 different addresses from the piggy bank. Maybe always use the same address (printed on coloured paper) and then simply give piece of papers with the value of the transaction on it the kid can put into the piggybank.

Why do you have 15-20 bank accounts?

Every code is written intentionally. I’ve never in my career zoned out and suddenly had a whole transaction protocol written on my screen in a way you sometimes find yourself unaware how you’ve driven the past 1-2 minutes as you cannot recall yourself paying attention.
A glitch is an unintended consequence of a mistake someone has made - neither does it mean the programmer is bad nor that the whole system itself is unstable/shitty. It’s simply a case noone in the process from planning over developing up to testing and production has had previously and thus noone resolved.

I hope for the person maintaining that code that you have undone all frankenstein related code haha

I haven’t submitted any comment previously to agree/disagree with in first place. After all, ‚So it’s fully applicable here“ could suggest that you disagree with the other redditor. The way you perceive that last sentence is completly up to everybody.
Additionally, regardless who you agree/disagree with, I‘m not adding a fluff, but disagreeing with you on the intentionally written part. As said, every code (that is actually used in production, is written intentionally. It‘s got nothing to do with the definition of a glitch.
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:33:26
Well, I don’t consider myself a professional dev as well, but I had the possibility to work with a couple who are. And you can believe me, each of them do have such What, HOW? moments frequently.
Yeah, I believe there is a better word, but thank you for the discussion, you have given me insight to what you have wanted to express and I did understand it.
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:25:13
No need to apologize. Mistakes appear in humans as often as in computers. Considering the comment I‘m answering to, I guess I‘ve contributed to the confusion as well. 
My point wasn‘t that intentional code can’t have bugs or glitches (to which you seem to understand the difference in between those two, even if many don’t distinguish between them) - it‘s actually that every code is intentional written, regardless whether there are glitches/bugs in or not.
I understand that my point seems to be a very.. useless(?) or rather minor distinction, but I simply refuse to believe any code that is used in any production, has found its origins in a developer who didnt intentionally sit down and wrote code being fully aware of what his intentions are - even if executed badly. You can’t develop anything, if you don’t have an intention of using commands.
Maybe I‘m having the same mindset as you but just express myself in a way someone else can’t perceive the same idea. I‘m just trying to say, every code is written intentionally, thus should not belong in a definition of a glitch, because the fact it’s written intentionally does not alter the definition of a glitch.
Regardless, as said that is a very minor, for most people pedantic distinctions. I genuinely believe I have wasted your time, sorry haha

You should. Your affluance is based on economy. 
Only if the economy is ‘running’, you can profit from it, maintain a single (or multiple) Head-Household and finally save money, with which you can passionate your individual selfs dreams. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:54:03
**Edit 2:** ***Sorry this whole post got bigger than expected as well as wanted to be.*** *it‘s maybe worth a read though*
You brought up a very good point, indeed. The thing is, it’s not the garbage products, its ourselves. It’s us, us who are trying to chase the absurdliest dreams with all the ressources someone has, because they have been told, they could ***become anything***. Furthermore, as common knowledge^4 already for a long time, —those— some people^4 do ***need everything*** in order to become who or what they wanted to become.^4
But the economy would still work wonderful. In fact, inside the given economy there would simply be produced ‘less’.
In each of these scenarios the crucial part for humans is they cannot imagine a smaller economy, without overreacting (thinking the humans would still be in Mid Ages), nor differentiate between a over-exhausted and a rational economy. How should they even be able to do so, imagine economys with absolutely no relatable scale.
The truth is, even if we would shop carefully (looking out for the environment and each individual self), —someones— the average affluance^1 would not have changed, **And that‘s a good part!** Infact, most and many of  the ‘Wealth-Peaks‘, where money is concentrated and stored until used for economical earthquakes; Wealth-Peaks would be more evenly-distributed throughout this planet and people who pay attention to local goods would result into increased purchasing power of smaller and medium-sized businesses in the area, going on to benefits, like let the employees earn more net worth, or pumping the money into the industrial part of ones economy^2. Each of us could reduce the stuff he/she buys throughout the daily life and not have their property drastically changed.^3
Only those, who already have a fortune (partially received due to lucky occurrences as well as to leap at the chance) does this really harm. They might also loose bigger parts of their markets due to slump in interest.
So, to sum it up: Only **if an individual doesn‘t participate in our current economy** (as consumer, employee or employer,  someone using something created due to economy, or even just as a pssenger in^4 the bus), **he might say, he couldn‘t care less.**^4
**For all the others, don‘t buy garbage products and keep them as long as possible.**
**Edit**, after rereading my text again, I have wanted to add some informations, regarding to some numerical markers in my old text
1) The wealth will not be shared among the whole world based upon a given percentage equally or by other criterias. Some rich people might have gone bankrupt, some random Humans on a random locations might have became a ‚rich peoples‘. But we should focus on the average wealth, which starts somewhere by the homeless guy’s wealth and goes up to top tier managers. Those average wealths would still be the same, except for the outliers being less outliered.
2) I just felt to add some more text on here, mostlikely becaused someone could perceive a wrong idea of what I wrote.
3)  Well, if we produce and (ab)use less, it‘s logically thinking, we would also have less goods to use, But considering we do have *too much* goods, that’s a deal o would want to make
For the fear of people who would think that this way, researches would be slown down and inventions missed. We can‘t know what we’ve missed, and found other solutions to get along all the time.
Like i.e all the logistics-companies raised  only upon due to globalization, but on the locally (and reduced) markets they will play more minor roles. On the other hand, we could also have created somewhat like a portable freezer, allowing smaller companies to carry out their grocery trade on local markets everyday, and keeping the goods stay completly fresh.
