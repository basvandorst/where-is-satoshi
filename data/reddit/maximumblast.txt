The private key also includes the public address, right? So whenever I want to give btc in paper form all I need to do is send btc to An address, then give away the private key to that address?

Good job. I also own BCH but this was really odd.

Maybe give them one half of the keys and your lawyer /notary the other half, and instruct him to only hand over his half in 2022?

France stores the information of where what radioactive waste of their nuclear plants is stored on paper, printed with Acidfree ink because that’s still the most durable storage of information we currently have. That waste will be radioactive thousands of years.

you could set up a wallet in "watching mode" like electrum. you wouldnt give it your private key, only the public adresses. 
thing is your ledger doesnt use only one address, but multiple ones. this is to enhance privacy. theres something like a xpub key that shows your balance, but doesnt work for segwit wallets yet:
actually you could simply view that xpub key on a block exlorer like blockchain.info, no need for electrum.
