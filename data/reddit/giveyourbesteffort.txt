Where did you get I was forced to retire? No one can force someone to retire! 
There you go again with your "magical thinking". They were frivolous suits, people falling on slippery parking lots. Records proving precautions were taken proved them frivolous and got them tossed. Perhaps you've never owned a business? 
You really need to tone down that "magical thing" that possesses you.
