What happens when quantum computers advance enough to crack all the passwords of every clients in the banks and credit card issuers database?

When this becomes a problem, bitcoin will be far advanced and more secure and the traditional financial system (very slow on innovative technology) will be the first one to get broken.

Well, I'm a Brazilian and I've bought the entire outfit (from clothing to toys) for my future daughter in Purse with bitcoin.
I'm a long term HODLer of bitcoin, but have no problem spending it with discount when I see a chance. Because I've used bitcoin I've saved tons of money, specially regarding the crazy prices of these products here in Bananaland.

I Understand. But I liked the solution with discount. I had terrible experience doing directly in other websites (like panful for instance) because of all the scammers.  
Purse was a very good platform to create confidence in both sides of the transaction. Now I believe people like me are kind of orphan of such service or just have to accept their kind of support.

I see. But the greater discounts advantage that Purse has is not in it, right?

Why 400k usd? Are u counting the missing bitcoins instead of the 21 millions? It would be around 330k considering a 7 trillions gold market cap wouldn't it?

Definitely a possibility. But is also possible that both rises up against toxic fiat. ��.

I see. I would definitely like to ride this 70k usd difference though. :-) . But I got your point.
Personally, IMHO, I see this happening in less than 5 years.
