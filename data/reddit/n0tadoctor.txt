I'm not sure if we'll see the same transaction volume this year as we did last year. Bitcoin was on it's way up encouraging people to spend some of their newly aquired capital. Right now most people would consider Bitcoin to be low and not looking to part ways with their precious stash. But then again there are still plenty of people who use Bitcoin for what it was intended and use it as a currency with out regard to price. So I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.

Electrum works the same way as mycelium using the 12 word seed key to recover. The more "security conscience" bitcoiners would typically store the seed key offline makeing it more difficult for your wallet to be comprised in case some one really wants to get your bitcoin. There are ways to keep your electrum wallet on a usb drive which I recomend for your savings just make sure you keep that recovery key extremely safe (perferably never let it touch an internet connected device for extreme caution) just remember with bitcoin you are your own bank and its your responsibility to keep you finances secure.

regardless of all this 50% of all the coins are held in 4 wallets. talk about distribution.

They would be selling the 12m XPY, which they are already selling way over market value on their website. The better question is why you would want to invest in a centralized coin? that undermines the whole point. If i thought Josh Garza was going control the future of my money i wouldn't switch from the federally issued notes i already use. How is GAW replacing the FED any better than what we already have? It's clearly a scam. it was never built to succeed how long do you think GAW will foot the bill to keep buying paycoin at $20 a pop? eventually it will collapse.

It depends on what amount, and why you would classify that as insignificant. Some people still use Bitcoin faucets and others determine them to be insignificant. I remember when i was starting in Bitcoin and small "insignificant" amounts of Bitcoin were fascinating. Now those "insignificant" amounts are worth much more. So just because one would label something as insignificant doesn't mean that everyone would.

To each his own I'm not hear to try to convince you a penny is worth your time. The real point is it gives people the choice to decide the extrinsic value.

From my phone I could walk up to anyone else with a smart phone and instantly transmit any denomination of bitcoin conceivable and transfer that value with out the need of third party serivices and with out the need for proprietary hardware/software. You can only spend your apple pay at accepting merchants who have probably paid a good bit to apple just to be able to accept their payments. Bitcoin is about decentralizing currency not about giving apple a cut of the take. Congratulations apple you made it easier for 5 year olds to run up outrageous charges on in game purchases. They can't keep peoples private information secure but you trust them with your financial information. Now apple can keep a ledger of all your transactions. Think about all the consumer data they can collect from that.
Not to mention the true benifits of bitcoin. I can instantly send bitcoin to the furthest corner of the world instantly and with next to no fees with out even needing the name/address/routing number/bank account number/ etc. Of the recipient. And it is guaranteed to arrive with no exceptions.

@_date: 2014-12-04 01:00:51
could just be simple price fluctuation. At the time i sent the tip the value was $1 and now the overall price of Bitcoin has dropped slightly. I have never withdrawn from change tip so I am uncertain of any transaction fees associated with their wallet service. But common place for smaller transactions is to tie in a smaller transaction fee to incentivize miners to confirm the transaction. Depending on the default configuration,  some wallets might attach a transaction fee automatically to make sure your transaction is confirmed by the network.

That being said an individual without a bank account or credit/ debit card would not be able to withdrawal their funds from paypal giving bitcoin the advantage if this individual resides in an area with high bitcoin adoption and localbitcoin merchants. Needless to say this individual can now accept payments directly without need for intermediary taking funds from his much needed pockets.

Sort of like multiple bank accounts. Your bitcoin can only be controlled by the private keys you hold them in. And it is very important you keep your private keys secure which is why I usually hold my private keys on my phone or desktop. If you lose your private keys you lose control of your bitcoin. Mycelium allows for you to back up your wallet using a 12 word seed key you can write down and use to recover your keys if you ever lost them. Clients like bitcoin core or multibit (thin client) will require you to back up a .dat(core) or .key(multibit) and store across multiple thumb drives and make sure you back up often. Cold storage when you hold your private keys offline using a paper wallet or other cold storage methods.  It can be a bit tricky for beginners do make sure you research and determine what methods will work best for your needs.

Welcome to financial freedom. Here's $1 to get you started [For a quick and easy to understand over view click here](
**make sure you understand how to properly send and store your Bitcoin**
**MAKE BACK UPS and update them often** 
i can not stress that enough. Keeping back ups of your important data is a necessity 
take some time and figure out what wallet solution will work best for you. my personal recommendations are:
* for PC/OSX/Linux desktop - [Multibit]( it is quick to load and has a very user friendly interface.
* Android wallet is hands down [Mycelium](
* iOS wallet though i have never used an iOS wallet ill have to go with the most recommended around here [Breadwallet](
* For a Web based wallet that you will be able to access from any device i recommend [Coinbase's wallet]( the offer a vault service to keep your savings more secure and you can buy and sell for USD directly from this wallet.
[you can check out other wallet options here](
Where to buy Bitcoin if your in the US? my recommendations would be:
* [Cirlce]( they allow for the quickest buying process using a credit card
* or like i said [Coinbase.]( they will require you to link a bank account (which may take a few days) and a credit card for instant purchases

The best way to learn is to try. download a mobile wallet and send a couple dollars over. Practice backing up your keys and restoring them, move funds over to a desktop wallet and play around with it. once you are comfortable with these solutions try offline and air-gaped practices. its hard to loose your Bitcoin if you are sure of what address you are sending them too and you have a copy of your private keys.

In your scenario you would be removing 99% om the avaliable supply from circulation. The remaining avaliable supply would bounce around wildly in search of a new price then stablize.

Bitcoin is not quite main stream enough for this. and it most likely made things a little more complicated when the split the tips at the end of the day. Maybe if you tipped a barista directly if they had a mobile wallet or a qr printed out but if you do drop in a paper tip make sure to keep a copy of the private keys in case you want to sweep the funds later if they aren't moved.

right now the market decides the value of Bitcoin, your basic supply and demand at work. But I'm sure you can convince some one a Bitcoin is worth their car or the same value as any other asset. That's the great thing about barter systems.

How often are you just randomly walking up to people pushing bitcoin? any why? maybe i could understand if you were trying to unload your coins. But if you it just comes up in casual conversation that's different. There is absolutely nothing wrong with people going around spreading awareness and handing out paper wallets, whether they are welcomed or not, One day that person may look back and think hmm maybe i should have held onto that paper wallet, and maybe i should have listened to what that person had to say.

A couple follow up questions. Do you plan to use your own off chain transactions or will all the transactions incur a fee. And as far as using a phone number as verification services such as google voice would enable false account creation. And in this day it would seem that advertisers would be able to gain access to any public number which would allow for spam messages to be sent. Unfortunately cell phone numbers are not as private as we would like them to be and don't offer much anonymity.

The fact is a lot more cash is stolen annually than Bitcoin, Its used to fund terrorist groups, and exchanged anonymously in black markets, and all without a public ledger. Bitcoin is not intended for centralized services. It is the fault of the service not the currency. Bitcoin was made for you to store your money in your private keys. Exchanges should attest mitigate the risk by running multiple hot wallets instead of having 19,000 coins in one. There is no reason coins cant be dispersed between multiple keys. Its not easy to crack and encrypted private key. Your welcome to try though, [Here ya go John Dillinger](

How do you expect banks to back up sn investment in a currently unproven technology? To buy up a bunch of currently devaluing currency that isn't even globally recognized as a currency.

Ok ill go through your article you referenced with 49 sources and point out every out of context or just blatant misrepresentation of data. And how the hell do you expect the US government to know every user of Bitcoin on a global level if they can't even get their pdfs to load? Again your failing to cite any sources for your claims that bitpay and coinbase remains stagnant. Just stating the same sentence over and over does not make it any more factual. 
Edit: by the way your nonsense article claims that Saturibi app accounts for 50% of the current daily transactions. Which would suggest the average daily transactions increased 100% the day that app was released an I see NO data to support that. Not to mention the other completely absurd claims it makes.

It is actually good for bitcoin. As I've seen a lot of people saying this but failing to explain why: It provides a lower entry point for new adopters and promotes greater distribution of the coins. Bitcoin works just as well at $1 as it does at $1000. People need to remember Bitcoin is not a speculative penny stock Bitcoin is a technology. The network will not fail with a lower price as many like to claim. Miners will not simply all call it quits one day. Bitcoin is a growing organism and still has time before it reaches maturity.

If Coblee said "Bitcoin is worth the price of gold, so Litecoin should be worth the price of silver and ill honor that"(deceiving investors) but doesn't that would be a lie(But not the case here). Litecoin was the first clone of Bitcoin. It uses a different algorithm and has a faster block time. It deserves its due. But the simple comparison to a metal makes no suggestion of outrageous ROI to persuade investors. Paycoin was introduce with a coin sale at $4 while a $20 IPO was promised. That is just downright fraudulent behavior.

Right now we have bitcoin the first cryptocurrency to establish its place in the real world. Most of these other coins will never be anything other than traded by a small community of enthusiasts until they fizzle away. Coins are launched every day with the promise of something big and none of them have found their place in the world outside of enthusiasts.

They have informed me I will receive a free anx plus card so I may just make sure that card works properly before I upgrade the premium card. How long have you been in contact with support? It seems it takes about 24 hours before they responded to my email and we're rather vague when answering my concerns.

I agree this would be nice to be able to add a forwarding address to compromised keys but there is also still the possibility of once the private key is compromised so is the fowarding address. Maybe a solution that locks the output address for an address so if the keys are comprised the theif can initiate payment the entirety of the funds will be delivered to the pre determined locked output address. A sort of all or nothing transaction.

Im not exactly sure, it should be on their site somewhere, I beleive its under the section for your linked debit cards in the settings menu, but I know (from the compare cards page on their site) there are no fees for checking your balance on premium cards unlike the other cards so you should be able to check it there or try to check the balance on a local atm. I believe premium card balance is also supported by their mobile app but im not entirely sure as I haven't received my card yet. Keep me up to date on the developments, I really hope it works out for you in time for your payment.

How ever much you would like I know circe doesn't charge any fee's if you transfer from your bank acct and if you use a cc is about $3-5 in fees. You are limited to $500 a week when you first open your acct. They have android and ios apps and you can access it from any web bowser so it could also be used for your wallet if your looking to small a small amount but larger amounts I recommend you secure yourself.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:15:27
You wanted a stable value. The dollar has proven to be a relatively stable token of value. Pegged to $1 would result in stable valued crypto currency which is exactly what you were looking for. 1 nubit = ~$1 at all times. Of course you can change what token pegged to but in this experiment the dollar was chosen and it works.

As far as I know multisig is not completely ready for consumer adoption. Many companies offer web based solutions where they hold one of the keys but until i am able to use multisig seemlessly with bitcoin core (where I control all the keys generated offline) I would not consider multisig completely ready. There are a lot of companies doing amazing things in this space though and I believe advancements in multisig security practices will help drive consumer adoption.

Who cares. Coinfire does not determine the outcome of GAW. Its been beaten to death Paycoin is a scam. 97% premine you'd be a moron to invest. Garza is a know fraudster "always profitable cloud mining" Ha thats an oxymoron in its self. He was a fraudster before his time in Bitcoin. Investor who refuse to do their due diligence and ignore the help of others are on there own. Paycoin will collapse soon enough I've watch many scams exactly like this implode in the space. Paycoin will never be worth $20 and weither the SEC is looking at Garza currently,  they will be what he has done is extremely illegal on many different counts.
