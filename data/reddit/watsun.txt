I can't take this pressure anymore, I'm transferring my investment into Bitcorn
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:38:37
I'm gonna be glued to my screen to buy the dip this morning. What price would you guys say is a good time to buy?

Should have done this yesterday :P
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:42:23
I'm really tempted to try to sell now and buy the dip. Is that too risky? I was kicking myself today for not doing this last night. . 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:45:28
Can you guys give me a reason or two why I should invest in Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:33:52
these flat candlestick lines keeping me in suspense. . Everyone at my work not into crypto now thinks I'm the most boring person ever cause they only ever see me staring at graphs all day.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:22:19
do you guys think its a good idea to scrape profits until you regain your initial investment? Or just leave as much as you can and add moar to your BTC stash?

@_date: 2017-12-04 22:33:40
not really
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:42:02
What price do you think will be a reasonable re-entry for BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:45:14
All good now, was probably a pending transaction, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:48:39
very cool, thank you much
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:08:21
this forced hold from coinbase is killing me lol

Working tech support has its perks when you work for a dead account - I create about 1-2 tickets a day max, the rest of the time is up to how you want to spend it at a desk. It's insanely ideal for my life right now. It's not even taking phone calls either, just responding to people on facebook and twitter for our client account
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:31:22
thank you for your service
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:21
This price is dropping faster than the comedic value of these analogies
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:52:37
Thanks for your reply!
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:32:06
that feel when gdax goes down and you realize watching crypto has been filling the empty void in your life
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:35:46
different exchanges have differing rates
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:21:54
Any resources you could link on getting started with a project like this?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:27:16
Right now on Coinbase when trying to sell any of my portfolio - it says 0.00 for all accounts and my USD wallet is not available. It's all showing normally under dashboard view though. Any ideas? I know that ethereum trading is disable atm.

he's in there, gotta look harder!

Like a moth to a flame, I was drawn to daytrading BTC, and I got burned just like you all said I would. . . 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:00:44
You think so? I've been trading on the dip all day and figured it was over at this point. Still have half my USD to convert though. I guess I should wait then?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:34:46
I feel like watching bitcoins volatility is a drug like experience and now I'm finding myself in withdrawal from the craziness a couple days ago. I need a tolerance break I guess. Or maybe tomorrow we will get a re up.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:13:54
sounds like speculation to me

Your uncle is John McAfee? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:45:02
Where do you guys think the floor is this time?
Also, I've heard how the futures deal will bring down the price of BTC, in what scenario would futures increase the price?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:31:07
any way to do anything with BTC which is set to arrive 5 days from now (on coinbase). Or do I sit and sip whiskey while contemplating my financial decisions?
