Any advice on how I would go about doing that though? I found this guy,         He has a wide array of data points, but the only value I see is "outputvalue" which would be the price in Bitcoins and not in USD amounts.

And also includes "BlockTime" but like you said, Id have to cross reference with price history charts.

x is time, eg. 1-365, the other is % and value of bitcoin. The daily % of gambling transactions is multiplied by 15 to fit everything on the same axis'.

I obtained the data myself through an experiment

That's kind of a problem. It's not necessarily creating Bitcoins but it's similar. And just by saying something isn't in the chain doesn't mean it didn't happen..

Thanks for the help!

What about double spend attacks? 
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:55:21
Im not saying that there aren't any precautions taking place. But there are examples of people trying to trade Bitcoins without proper usage. See here: "There is a period of time before a transaction has fully confirmed where a tactic similar to counterfeiting could be successful.
A race attack is one -- where at the time of purchase two transactions using the same bitcoin are sent. The first spend transaction is sent to an address the attacker controls, but is announced only to nodes of miners. At about the same time (milliseconds) a second spend attempt is sent to the merchant's bitcoin address and is announced to a wide number of nodes. The hope by the attacker is that the second transaction beats the first in getting relayed to the merchant's node. When that happens, the merchant accepting on 0/unconfirmed will deem payment as received but the transaction will never confirm later as the mining nodes that saw the first transaction will have rejected it and instead will confirm the first spend.
There have been no claims published as to how successful this race attack would be and no reports of merchants getting defrauded from it but few merchants accept 0/unconfirmed thus far.
In a way then, the second spend was an attempt to perform a counterfeit bitcoin transaction, and there is some (well above zero) likelihood of it being technically successful.
The Finney attack is another method to attempt a counterfeit against a 0/unconfirmed. - 
And, if the merchant doesn't take precautions, there is a variation on the Finney attack where even a 1/unconfirmed can be a counterfeit: -

This is for a research project. I'm determining what percentage of the transactions on the blockchain are gambling. Im not "blacklisting" anything. Please don't just assume things. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 01:04:49
Its the percent of gambling transactions that occur daily on the blockchain. Refer to my previous posts to see information on how I got these numbers.

But you also can't be sure that Bitcoins are not being created illegitimately or that they are not fraudulent. I understand the mining process, but I'm trying to make a point to people that don't necessarily understand the process that Bitcoin is a legitimate way to exchange money.

Gambling in general - In most senses of the word
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:48:52
Basically, the project is trying to show that bitcoins cannot be counterfeited in a way other than knowing the protocol or having common knowledge about Bitcoin. And by showing that it applies to Benford's law, yes it will confirm the Law as well. 
I appreciate your reply and I will post the results on here as soon as I get them!

Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-10 20:09:22
Sent! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:29:41
That's good advice! I was thinking about doing a set time interval as you suggested, but I also want to be sure to get as many transactions as I can because I want as many data points as I can get. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 18:38:32
Possibly, good point! Thanks for the input :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 20:08:55
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:28:51
Correct, Im only analyzing the transactions. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:32:29
Thanks! I will be sure to send you the final paper if you are interested in that as well.
