It's really a scam on the bank, usually a business check hoping they can get the cash from the bank before the check fails to clear.

Actually I think if you deposit the money and then spend it, you might be required to refund that money to the bank since it wasn't yours.

Ok assuming that's the case, what if Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is unlike any market this world has ever seen and the Wall Street cheat sheet doesn't apply?  What if a global, decentralized, heterogeneously regulated market (cryptocurrency) doesn't behave like a national, regulated, centralized market (i.e. Wall Street).

What is your goal?  Why do mining if alts was working?
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:46:02
But you could look at a yearly cycle, a monthly cycle, or a weekly cycle etc. and fit it to whatever time period you want and stretch the axes a little to make it match.

What do you want to do and why?  That's a good place to start.

It's probably how they wanted the money transferred back. It's great for Bitcoin, it's showing some utility!

Then, if the projected mining profit minus (cost of electricity and up front cost of miners and rising difficulty) over the payback period will be greater than your projection for crypto prices during that time, should work out.  Sounds like a lot more work to me, but more fun for sure.  Setting up and maintaining miners is better than chasing headlines and feeling bad about yourself a lot, lol.

Why does it have to die?  Is it all about the trademark?  It's really interesting because no one can get a trademark for a decentralized currency, there is no trademark protection unless it's centralized.

I think this lawsuit has a legitimate claim on bitcoin.com (which is centralized) from calling BCH Bitcoin.  The problem is it seems that he (and many others) believe that BCH is bitcoin, and since it is (supposed to be) a decentralized form of currency, there shouldn't be anyone to sue at BCH.  Care needs to be taken because if legal action is pursued against a decentralized cryptocurrency, that gives governments more reason to define it as a centralized organization that can be regulated and censored.  A good outcome would be to reach consensus through testing and data that would merge BCH and BTC, but currently it's cutthroat battle until 1 of them dies (or both - which I fear would be the worst outcome).

So it is about the name.  Calling it the true Bitcoin is calling it by a name.  How does the public distinguish between the two networks except by their name?  The best way so far I've seen is by ticker symbol, but I don't know if that is legally enforceable.  If so, Bitcoin.com hasn't changed BCH to BTC that I know of.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:07:04
You're right, so I should clarify that the efforts would merge, not the code and blockchain itself, maybe one side will quit and go to the other.  For a while there Roger was holding about half BTC and half BCH in case he was wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:46:36
Of course because Roger has been calling BCH Bitcoin Cash this whole time.  He's not consistent.  If he called it Bitcoin from the day they forked, then at least he'd be consistent and we'd have had this same argument.  He just needs to accept that big blocks didn't make consensus so he's not part of the original network.  He just wants to keep the brand because he needs adoption and was so attached to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:13:07
There is a difference between BCH ceasing to exist and the majority of BCH users coming back to BTC.  The code will always be there, and there will probably always be nodes running.  If a majority of users move back from BCH to BTC Roger won't be as interested in pushing BCH.  The only way I could see that happening is if the mining becomes expensive, like if the block sizes become too large because that's all they are willing to change in order to scale.
