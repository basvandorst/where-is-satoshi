No that is not what I'm thinking of, I mean; could someone just take their code and run it on another server, making a new concurrent for Coinbase and Blockchain, and if that would be possible, why did nobody do it so far?

The intresting part here is: Why and how does Singapore have a sovereign wealth fund?? Aren't those just for Gas and Oil states?

I'm not sure whether or not am alone in this, but I'm here and primarily a silent observer, wondering where this Bitcoin thing is going.

Ahhh so it would be to technically difficult to rebuild this, but how can you be sure they not stealing your coins if the backend isnt open sourced

I'm completely against tracking of course, but your comparison just isn't correct, it is much more like just grabbing a newspaper in a store, reading it, and then put it back, without buying it.

Elementary OS is currently the best OS out there (for non tech persons like me at least) glade they are finally accepting Bitcoin.

Freya will be based on 14.04, so the support shouldn't be a problem
