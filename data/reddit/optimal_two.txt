It's called diversification. 
I am hugely bullish on crypto, but also own equity/fixed income assets. 
Am I confident that crypto will outperform? Yes.
Is there a chance that it doesn't? Potentially. Hence it's worth keeping some money in other asset classes.
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:12:11
Gross notional exposure, not net.
The majority of this is long-dated, hedged, and hard to unwind. This will slowly be traded out versus other counterparties with appetite. Don't expect this money to materialise in crypto.

hence why it's good to 'think like a trader' to try and avoid getting burned where you can.
Failing that, just dollar cost average and hodl - you'll win in the long run.

Take a look at the weekly chart and see what happens when the RSI has been historically as high as it was... it was very likely that traders were going to position themselves in that way. This combined with the implied reasons for the rally (leveraging up) made it a good trade. 
I appreciate we all want to see BTC succeed but trading is a zero sum game and unfortunately you will always be on one side of the win or lose.

I guess the question is whether anyone genuinely believe this will be a significant catalyst? I am skeptical.

There's a saying in trading, 'you can't trade every move'
If you have a short time horizon, you are more likely to try to trade every move.

Tips -
1. Start off with no/low leverage
2. Hedge 
3. 10/30 day moving average crossovers and RSIs
4. Don't day trade - take a longer term view. 
5. Set stops and be disciplined in letting them get hit, either stop losses or take profits
If your heart is racing while you are about to take a trade, stop, wait, and think.
Don't be afraid to not hold a position. You always have three options - buy, sell, do nothing. Sometimes doing nothing is the right move.

I agree with the sentiment. Feels like we can rebound from the weak scenarios - which is good, because 99% of the projects out there are going to fail.

No, I am intimating that they are short selling to hedge and smooth returns, not undertaking a concerted effort to devalue BTC as the OP predicates.

Generally trade with a -5/+40% net delta. Helps to manage the drawdowns, tend to use ETH as a short to hedge given its higher beta on the way down and short vs suitably liquid alts like LTC/XRP

You do realise that there are no hedge funds with a short crypto bias? The crypto hf industry is heavily predicated on asset price rises - there is no incentive for this to occur.

They are legit. Celsius are another legit player in the field, better rates for stablecoins there than elsewhere.

A soft deal will see a small rally to GBP, and revoking would see a significant rally. A 12 March no-deal block should underpin some bullish movement in GBP, so be lively!

Literally no point in crypto.

Because you actually 'take ownership' of the underlying asset, I.E you could transfer it into a wallet that you hold.
A spreadbet is essentially like going down to the bookies and 'betting' on an outcome of a horse race. I.E you receive payment if X event happens, but don't actually ever take ownership of the horse or the jockey's purse.

Liquidity providers take care of themselves. 
Lay off risk by reducing the slice size on either side of the spread so as not to get legged, unless you are long/short inventory and looking to rebalance.

To be fair the institutional view of Ari is that he spends more time tweeting than managing money. According to Blocktower's performance they may well be right.

I am skeptical because the vast majority of futs contracts are closed out before settlement, so little delivery of the underlying commodity actually takes place.
The open interest on existing futures contracts is quite low, and futures generally have a cooling effect on the price of crypto given that we are currently constrained by hedging on the short side (poor markets in the majority of altcoins, for example)
Bakkt will be a case of buy the rumour, sell the fact, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 10:57:06
Not worth the capital and hassle. There are far too many exchanges already and consolidation will occur as many will fail/M&amp;A activity.
Someone out there will already be undertaking this, and they will have much more in the way of resources to achieve it.

I seem to remember Alistair Heath writing an article in city am a number of years ago showing that if other items had held the same value as property a tesco chicken would cost about 50 quid.
Your colleague is an idiot. Equities outperform property. BTC has outperformed equities over a 10 yr period. I'm not suggesting that will always be the case but it is observable over this time horizon.
