A few people were asking for a dip so that they can buy. That time is now!
You want to help Bitcoin? Everyone with a GPU install a miner, let it run for a couple of days and help clear the backlog. A thousand people start doing that, it starts to make a difference. Don't do it for the monies, do it because it's the right thing to do and show the haters that decentralized is the way forward.

Easiest way to check if you're on segwit addresses is if they start with "bc1".
(at least, that's how i understand it)

Just bought in with 50 EUR at 0.0037. That's the maximum I can do right now.

I was in the capital of Switzerland few days ago. Was walking around, having a good time. Had a glance at the street name: "HODLERSTRASSE". I knew I was on the right track.

Running a confirmation node is easy. And if you're worried about the size of the tx you can run it in pruned mode:

Absolutely this.

It's a tried and tested strategy.

I had some spare money to try out BTC. Said I'll cash out when I make 100%, and drop out when I lose 50%. Today is that day and I'm limiting my losses.
I am also keeping something like 0.01BTC just for kicks.

It was not a large amount of money. If I were few thousands in the negative I'd be rather unhappy. Like this it was just an experiment, I learnt a lot about cryptocurrency and just decided it's not worth the hassle for me. I don't have the time for effective trading, and for everything else the market is too volatile right now. I'll keep a small stake just for fun, but in any case, I wish you good luck!
