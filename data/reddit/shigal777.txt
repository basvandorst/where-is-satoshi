Suppose you buy bitcoin at $300, and it soon goes down to $50. You would see a smaller loss if you mined the bitcoin initially instead of paying for it. This is because spending money on the equpment/power would likely yield less bitcoin than buying, and keep in mind the dollar value of bitcoin does not directly affect how much bitcoin you mine. When you mine it, you're only gaining bitcoin, not losing dollars (unless you sell your bitcoins).
But lets say you buy bitcoin at $300 and it shoots to $1000. In this case it would have been more profitable to buy it. Although mining it would also be profitable, spending the cost of mining hardware/power on bitcoin would yield more profits when the price goes up.

I was actually thinking of the economy episode when i wrote this... but it looks like this is a matt and trey formula

They would shit on it because they're matt and trey, but they actually are hardcore libertarians. I would imagine they would overstate it to make it laughable, but in the end defend the idea. I can see them doing something like:
randy hearing about it on news, gets obsessed, followed by the rest of the town going nuts like and supporting it cult-style
it gets so over the top bitcoin starts getting regulated like a normal currency with the townspeople praising new changes from government officials
bitcoin crashes, whole town is robbed by government, lessons learned, why it was good, why it crashed
and all throughout it possibly wouldn't even be bitcoin or even a cryptocurrency, just an analogy of it like blankbucks or some shit

What if it was an expensive meal?

True, but I love when cartman interacts with mexicans. Prime example is when he gets mexicans to paint shit in butters' house

meanwhile, cartman has like 300 mexicans in his basement manually solving hashes, and persists on doing so because it's cheaper than asics... and turns out hugely successful
