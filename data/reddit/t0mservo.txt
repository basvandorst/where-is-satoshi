This part if pretty obvious but timing the market is difficult. How do you know when to "reap the gains"

No frickin Way!
I'd like to thank the Satoshi. You like me, you really like me
Edit: is the real deal!  My man gave me platinum. Now to figure out what to do with this shiny trophy...
Thanks again @_date: 2017-12-06 04:15:32
On the Second K of Bitcoin, Satoshi gave to me, TWO Ledger Nanos...

Does anyone ever call you a Financial Panther?

quick question: Has there ever been another BCash situation where you'd get an equal amount of a split off coin based on your current holdings of BTC?

This guy is painting a target on his back.
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:24:05
Well, regardless, thanks for paving the way. None of it would have been possible without Bitcoin's contribution to the community. Have a good one.

Jesus dude....are you ok? PM me if you'd like to talk.

Wow, people in your community not only talk down to newer members and other cryptos but to entire genres of sports fans. It's no wonder Bitcoin has the reputation it does. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:52:55
I don't understand. I suppose I can agree that there are more unique places that accept bitcoin currently. (Though that is *Rapidly* changing). However, one can easily buy for instance an Amazon gift card using Dogecoin and from there you can purchase most anything in the world...Also, I wouldn't underestimate the hearts and minds aspect of crypto. People LOVE Dogecoin despite what a few vocal detractors here in this specific sub would suggest.

Just because you say they have lost their spark doesn't mean it's true. Sure there was a bit of a lull in the excitement for a few weeks but then a few days ago there was the record breaking tweet, the mysterious do gooder walking the streets raising spirits, and then the NASCAR thing which is picking up huge momentum. 
In short, not sure where you are getting your info from but as an avid reader of I can say that lost momentum/spark simply isn't the case. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:16:35
and so modest too!

Are you currently subscribed to If not, come on over and get involved. The people there are so much more receptive to what you have in mind. I wholeheartedly agree with what you have said and things like Nascar, Doge4kids/Water, Jamaican Bobsled, Indian Olympian, Save Dogemas, SaveThemHood's Tweet will most assuredly send us to the moon.

I'm not sure if you frequent Doge or not but I do. Every day. I can tell you there is always mention of building up the Dogeconomy (see there's even a word for it) Just today I contacted another business and tried to gauge their interest in accepting digital currency. It seems like every 24 hours there is another business accepting, service launching, and invention being invented soaring to the top of @_date: 2017-08-11 21:46:23
Was this around the time the community was unsure of how to pronounce Dogecoin?
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:16:31
Got a source on that?

How did you claim your bitcoin cash?

Just wanted to say I was here! Hi Kids!

Congrats! :)

He's talking about holding to the point where you won't need to "cash out." Just spend btc for goods and services.

What kind of notifications are you using? Google alerts?

any chance you could explain that GDAX chart for me like I'm 5?
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:41:15
That was more about how to purchase bitcoin and less about how to read the charts but thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:10:56
Thanks. I just set up a google alert for Bitcoin. The first things to show up were very reactionary to this price correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:36:03
Down to about 511 by my calculation. 8:35 EST
Edit: Saw you included the 10K. That would make it apprx 1348 then.

I found this on Multibit's FAQ page:








I wonder what their definition of a short delay is.

The only silver lining to all of this.

The initial payment error which cost me a day was because of the volume of customers?

Has anyone else here made the jump from Doge to Bitcoin? As a long time holder of Doge (got in early mining 10k a day) I used Doges increased purchasing power and converted to BTC and couldn't be happier.
