Ahh okay, are cex pretty popular? Would you recommend another platform over cex?

Ahh right, and KYC defeats a fundamental purpose of crypto.

This was a useful thread, so a hardware wallet prevents this from happening because everything is done on the hardware itself, preventing any outside sources from seeing your private details being generated?

ELI5 why would I want to own/run my own node?

So it’s really for someone who wants to actively send and receive from a wallet, if you’re just HODLing then it doesn’t have any intrinsic benefit?

That’s a really thoughtful reply, thank you.
It’s money that I would be obviously sad to see go, I mean no one likes to loose that kind of money, but isn’t it quite unrealistic to think we would go back to zero?
I mean, I would be fine I’d say, I lost half. At least then I could say I didn’t miss the boat. Although knowing my luck it’ll go back up when I get out! :)

Hmm, you might be right. Buying once a month when the futures come in may be a safer bet.
Either way thanks for the advice, it helps to be able to talk to people about this stuff.

So... buy the dip?
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:23:35
I hear what you’re saying but I would be focusing on major Bitcoin events rather than day to day price. :)

Yeah I don’t have any dependants and a national healthcare system, I know, lucky me!
Really good advice though, thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:41:04
This was a great explanation, thanks.
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:41:42
This makes a lot more sense to me now, thanks a lot for taking the time. :)

US only? That’s a shame.
I would’ve liked to try my hand at turning that $30 into $31 or maybe even $32 if I played my cards right!
Alas, pas d'argent.
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:17:09
That’s good to know, thank you :)

No GBP?

What are the new generation of miners called?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:03:57
That makes sense, they’re selling before someone else does and they get less for their short
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:13:39
But muh lambo...

How do physical futures affect the actual price of bitcoin? Sorry I’m still learning all of this.
