Coindesk is a legit site, and I'm not seeing any malicious popups when I look...
Might have a malicious app on your device, or might have been some kind of malvertising that snuck in but seems to have been resolved

Already rebound to 13k
Anyone smart enough to buy at 10k just made a killing

ASICs will only ever lead to centralization. This is merely the beginning, eventually near all bitcoin mining will be controlled by the elite few rather than distributed to the many as was the original intention.

Excuse me sir; I'm an American bank manager of the the first national bank of America and have been since 2001. I noticed an account with your reddit username on it containing a sum of $4,000,000,000.00 USD. It appears that the account has been untouched for quite some time, and the money is frozen. In exchange for a mere 10 BTC I will move the funds to your account and deliver what is certainly your inheritence from Sr. Please send the coins to the following address:

Obviously the 90% is a generalization; but yes that's the general message, that most people lose out due to their own emotions

time to buy BTC!

Heh...remember when people defended Butterfly Labs? Let the sheep go to slaughter, it's pointless to try to save them.

Gox halted not only fiat but BTC withdrawal as well.
There are rumors claiming that either the owners have the money and are going to steal it all and vanish, and others that are claiming gox is broke and can't afford to cover the withdrawals.

well I suppose if they wanted to they could just forcibly distribute work for as far back as they desired, days, weeks, whatever. Of course people would notice the sudden disappearance of them from the network hash rate...
But let's say for whatever reason they didn't - they could basiclly start a race from as far back as they wanted to and with sufficient hash power would eventually surpass the 'main' blockchain replacing it with their own - resulting in the most destructive fork ever :D

Devs stated that if this ever happened they would hard fork to another algo thus burning asic r&amp;d costs and strongly dissuading future asic attempts

Not hackers necessarily. Could just be a rented botnet. Though a true DDoS is often used to cloak other malicious activity and intrusions during the chaos. I wonder if their IDS/IPS noticed anything

Think of it like this, every possible combination also has trillions of subcombinations because of the ability to add a salt to a random number
