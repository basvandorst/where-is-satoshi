There are international standarts on currency codes, that is [ISO 4217]( which is both the reason we shouldn't use **BTC** and that we should use **XBT**:
 reason we shouldn't use **BTC**:
"BT" Is the [ISO 3166-1]( code of [Bhutan](
"C" Is the identifier of a currency managed by Bhutan
And altough it is currently not in use, it could be.
 The reason we should use **X**BT:
"X" means it's not a nationally managed currency (Ex: Gold is XAU, Silver XAG)
"BT" is the community-chosen code for Bitcoin.

**Beware: Posix-centric advice**
The metadata is still there, and if the guy does more than dumbly look for the right name, like doing a

He will get

Which is quite a rare format.
To remedy this problem, I advise you to do a

First thing first: backup this copy of the wallet, online or offline, doesn't matter as it's encrypted.
Then: look into your passwords at the time (did you use this password for several services? Maybe they sent you your credentials when you signed up)
What was your password style at the time? Draw a timeline, and legend it with other accounts passwords when they were created/changed, often people have an evolution in their style of passwords that can show a general idea of yours.
Example: 
????? 
This example may be easier/harder/completely different than the reality, but in the case you can retrace it this way,ou can deduce the general pattern.
If you have a general pattern, you can ask someone to create you a list of potential passwords.
Don't forget to go back here and tell us if you made progress.
And good luck bro, I'm sincerely sorry for you.

The immediate answer is that Kickstarters uses the amazon payment system, as such, until amazon accepts bitcoins or kickstarter allows for alternative sources of funding such as cryptocurencies, you can't accept donations AND be counted in the official kickstarter funding.
For bitcoins to be sucessfully used in a crowdfunding all-or-nothing system, you would need a trusted peer providing an escrow service in order to return all the money to the sender in case the campaign does not fully fund.

Keeping them apart is the standart practice, here is why:
* **Anonymity**: If you create an address to receive payment from your pool, then another for mtgox, noone would be able to link those two except if you combine the inputs and/or fund the same address by each of these.
* **Keeping tabs on the transactions**: If you receive money from a service that has several paying addresses, it's next to impossible to know if it was the service that sent you this money, or a redditor.
Bonus: If you are a statistic nut, like me, you can draw nice graphs from that precious data.
* **Even if you send all your money on a single address, it will (probably) not hold your coins**: That is due to the fact that the standart practice of the clients is to create a separate change address with each transaction, which make tracking you more difficult.

Exactly, when you see rich people voting socialist saying "I want to pay more taxes",while some would like to tone them down in order to fulfil their agenda of reducing taxes (which I agree on), people (libertarians and anarchists, mostly) should showcase it as an example of wealth redistribution in a volontary society, where the money that would have been spent on taxes , reduced trickling down through all the layers of the bureaucracy , is invested in non-profits with often &lt;5% administrative fees, which are accountable to the donors.

I'll need to disagree with you here:
First you need to realize "wealth" isn't just cash sitting in the bank: not all assets are liquid: some are shares in companies, land, cars, insurances, etc.
Eluding the thousands of economical &amp; moral problem that would arise from confiscating their wealth, lets see what happens after taking their assets:
- Part of it is cash, that is easily spendable
- Then we have funds (pension, insurance, investment, etc.). Most of them the money can be withdrawn, but it is dangerous due to the nature of thee systems, which rarely holds that much cash.
- Then we have shares in companies, houses, cars, etc. taking them would mean the government gets participation or complete ownership of thousauds of companies. It now has two choices:
 - Liquidate them immediately: liquidating that much assets would mean fucking up the market big time! (Extremely high offer, same demand --&gt; prices go down or it doesn't sell
 - Manage them temporarily possibly liquidating them over time: the effects, while still skewing the market, would be less important, except now the government has to successfully manage thousands of companies, some which may be in desperate need of help, in extreme risk of bankruptcy.(and there are a lot of other problems) The government might be able to use them as collaterals, but thats really playing with companies that never wanted to be gov-controlled before.
 - Give them to a government controlled investment fund: Same risks of managing outlined before. (and more)
Theres a lot more to it than that, but simply seizing their liquidity isn't enough, and seizing their wealth extremely risky.
