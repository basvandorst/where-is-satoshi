The eu did not lower their interests rates due the brexit. They did this so boost the economic of the EU. However, they are now stuck and bound to the low interests rates, because increasing them will mean the southern part of the EU (Spain and Italy) will become a economic disaster and that will mean the north would need to take the fall with them. Meaning, the central bank (EU) has basically trapped themselves with this short term solution. Which can only work out of all of (or at least a majority) of the Eu participants have a strong economic backbone. 
The Brexit will definitely have their impact, but I do fear it will be more on the UK side than the Eu side.

Yes it is. The choice comes with sacrifice but don’t tell me it’s not a choice.

I think there all valid points, but you should also think about what the definition of a failed bitcoin is. And also what a successful bitcoin is. 
Bitcoin and other decentralized coins are the opposite of the current money currency. They uncontrollable and can only be somewhat regulated with laws. This attracts a lot of people, but also makes it hard to get accepted by the established order. The only way to get their attention is to become big enough. 
However, getting the attention doesn’t mean it will become bigger or stronger than the current currencies. Personally, I feel the current state of crypto already a huge success. If you define success as in it should become the number  currency in the world, I think we have a long road ahead and basically think it will never happen. Based on the fundamentals of cryptocurrency. 
I think there are too much factors that determine the success rate of bitcoin. One of them is the established order to accept a currency which they can’t control or manipulate that affects the worlds economy positively or negatively. So the average joe needs to completely lose trust in the current currency system and needs to go through all the effects of it (losing houses, losing jobs, losing current life styles). I think then and only then it can start currency domination.

They tell you that you told them that you believe your account has been comprised? If this what you’ve told them, how can you be that surprised that they locked your account temporary?
