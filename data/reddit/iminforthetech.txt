Yes, I do. That period is also what I'm refering to when I said I'm happy about the break.

Unpopular opinion: I'm actually quite relieved Bitcoin is taking a little break. We rose way quicker than anyone anticipated and a correction was inevitable. Don't have weak hands now and remember next year's halving and everything happening right now in politics and economics.

I too enjoyed those 5 minutes.

Overall the signs seem to be very bullish, but that Tether drama might pull BTC down in the future. I highly doubt it'll die anytime soon, though.

It's a vanity address.

It's so strange for a hacker to do this, though. Very organized individual apprently.

Your private key is stored in the hardware wallet, while the coins themselves are stored in the blockchain. To access your address, you need your private key. For example, if you want to access your address and send the coins somewhere else you'd create a transaction on your computer with how much you want to send to what address. That transaction then gets sent to your hardware wallet, which signs it using your private key and sends the signed transaction back to your computer. That way the private key never leaves the hardware wallet and thus never gets exposed.

Even if it goes down to 1K I'm not selling shit. I'm in it for the longer term.

I use Apple's built-in stock app for a quick glance and BlockFolio for tracking my portfolio.
