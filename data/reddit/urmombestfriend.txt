@_date: 2018-01-09 13:16:46
Did you even read where that star came from 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:16:00
Lol you claimed it was a statistic that stood for all pc users that only applies to gamers that use steam. That’s not even the majority of pc users
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:06:37
Get some morals dude. You can’t kill everyone who is richer than you. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:19:54
16gb. But How is that relevant. When i game i only need 8 tho i literally only upgraded to 16 in my desktop when i changed vsts(music production). 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:56:34
I want you to sit back reread your initial comment and think about why it was downvoted 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:35:33
Why no iPhone!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:08:42

@_date: 2017-12-04 15:22:52
Way over. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:08:59

@_date: 2018-06-07 05:00:49
I used to want one of these sets as a kid soooo bad
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:01:24
That’s not my point at all idiot. I’m saying out of anything else in the world besides emergency health services buying a fucking house is the smartest reason to cash out. Once again he is only cashing out 50%. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:36:04
Dude he’s only taking out half did you read. If he had 200,000 and took out 100,000 I’d commend him because it’s a HOUSE, something that you can increase the value of and pass on to your children. How old are you. With that mindset it defeats the purpose of  even getting the money. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:17:08
If your not getting free electricity then just sell them or return them and don’t open them. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:54:48
The damn title literally says 200k in bitcoins. Wym
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:17:24
Good luck on $100M wallet yet living on the corner. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:28:46
Lol so you’re telling me you would take 250,000 in bitcoin over a 500,000 house now. That’s stupid and childish. A house unless some natural disaster is forever if you own it. Bitcoin may not be forever. Stocks to invest may not be either if a company closes. Grow up dude. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:15:17
Bless his heart
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:23:39
Dumb bitch. It was already 200k at that time. 200k is a lot for a show that a listers rarely get from the get go. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:25:03
Jesus Christ dude. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:32:04
S9 is the newest one right. Perhaps. I haven’t really researched that one. I’ve just had bad experiences with antminers in the past and so have a good number of people. But those may be different. Can’t be ROI in under a year(probably less due to the worth growing still). Go ahead and make a wallet though 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:54:47
Lol I’m not I literally just bought $16 as a experiment (last month) and it grew to $27 rn. I mean if you know it’s a good plan, just figure out the wallet and do it. I didn’t know there were snobs on crypto currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:52:32
Naw no he won’t. He’s about to buy a $4-500,000 house. It’s a great investment and is the best reason to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:51:42
Lol can you tell this to my mother I’m trying to convince her to start her own wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:32:42
You sound dumb and immature. Bitcoin is great to invest in but not to bet your life on. It’s still very volatile. A house isn’t going anywhere. Do you have your own house? How much is in your wallet? These are adult questions.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:34:43
Lol be cool if you could transfer quick enough to have the 1000’s
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:13:40
I mean a 300 is pretty nice in itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:32:22
Hold and invest more until your 18/19. Bro. Take a little (25%) when you’re ready to make a large investment like a first car or something. You’ll need the money the most when you become a young adult. I wish someone would have told me that when i was your age. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:18:06
Amazing 
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:26:24
Lol you’re a sad case. People can do what they want. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:16:43
Dude i know the point of bitcoin. But anyone using it as a storage is actively loosing money. For it to operate well as a storage it needs to be less volatile. 
Literally the volatility of crypto is worse than any possible inflation or stagflation.
 Ex: you wanna keep $20k for the future for whatever reason. When the time comes to use the $20k and you check you’re wallet, there’s no garuntee that the $20k is now 40k or 5k. You literally can’t fight inflation/deflation. Lol this is coming from someone who’s been using crypto for the last 5 years. In reality there’s no purpose past making anonymous purchases, having a secondary currency and essentially investing/gambling and hoping for the best. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 00:10:38
That’s very true. The only problem with that is maintenance but yea really expensive non exotic cars drop value like bricks. You can literally get a year old AMG car or like $50k or less and it’s way worse with over 120k cars especially if they don’t sell well too
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:06:26
Oops I’m an idiot lol 
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:19:34
It is. If you try to use crypto as an investment you’ll either be extremely happy or extremely disappointed 
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:35:09
What are you talking about. Those quoted words aren’t even in either comment. No one said “store of value”
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:18:11
Is it a coin or a card wtf 
@_date: 2018-07-17 00:12:18
True true. I say if you can’t buy a car that cost over 120k in cash or brand new just don’t buy it lol
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:16:54
Except in real life those balloons are causing him to plummet to his death. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 14:21:22
And it may not be true either. People need to stop looking at it as a stock and look at as an actually currency for transactions. But tbh it does need to stabilize
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:08:23
True. It’s best to look at btc as a currency for purchasing and not a stock 
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:06:33
Sorry bout that 
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:22:16
Lol dude it’s not logical or scientific. It’s just a custom. Putting the sign before or after isn’t going to change a measurement. That literally makes it a non scientific change.
