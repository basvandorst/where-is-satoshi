that's not very constructive

Bitcoin governance model also has nothing to do with my point here, though I should have elaborated I suppose. What I'm thinking of is an implementation of liquid democracy, backed by a distributed network, which I imagine blockchain technology could help with. Apologies for the hand-waviness
Edit: seems like I didn't invent anything here: [

IMO killer use case for blockchain is democracy, as the one attack form it is vulnerable to is democratic by essence.

I'm not sure how that addresses my point, I (maybe naively) see holders as killing bitcoin, not helping it

I don't understand why you tie value with holding, in my understanding, the value of bitcoin should increase proportionally to the amount of "real-world" transactions that it enables?

Hm, I don't know anything about blockchains, just hope some day some form of cryptocurrency will let me get paid and buy stuff, I suppose I'll have to wait for the dust to settle, here's to hoping it doesn't take 10 years!

Good for you!

I must be dumb, but the subjective value of bitcoin *to me* (is that subjective enough?) was that it seemed like an elegant and efficient means of exchange, not that some people, who might very well be deluded for all I know, count on cheap reverse-psychology tricks to make me the greater fool!
