the general sell behaviour. its hard to explain it but sell walls suddenly appear out of nowhere very close to the actual value at precise times. this is not a panic sell where the value might drop fluidly and constantly but rather seem to behave in a pattern and according to the purchase orders. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:16:20
you are doing it wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:49:21
most cryptos are down. its been a dreadful start to the year. lots of bad news and very few if any good news. lets see there is the rocket man hack to korea exchange, congestion on the network, exchanges failing to addopt sigwit and new technological advances, china banning mining, korea raiding exchanges, the coinbase-BCH fiasco, exchanges closing new memberships... all this in a context with a lot of NEW (and unprepared and unaware) investors who will pull out at the first doubt. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:28:48
not all of them.. the ones i have are performing wonderfully because of their rock solid project.

watching BTC on gdax is like watching a scary movie. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:14:46
great! time to double my investment then
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:37:40
id rather be impatient than rude. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:18:13
god this coin is depressing.. any good news in the horizon?
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:45:44
i would if only people stopped selling at the first sight of green candles.. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:43:50
BCH is a scam coin not worth discussing. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:46:33
i started 2018 with an all-star crypto lineup in my portfilio, and BTC was supposed to lead them all the way to the lambo... why? *why?*
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:05:46
nice bought at Euro 12.5k about an hour ago and im out of fiat.

you must download bitcoin core here :  i think its about 150GB so itll take some time. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:08:44
i am not sure tbh.. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:56:18
what now? why is it going down again?
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:02:14
"Binance has accepted a limited amount of new users again, 240.000 in one hour! This shows the demand is real."
This is terrific news! We need more of these kind of news once in a while to keep the spirits up

@_date: 2018-01-05 15:22:41
well about bloody time bitcoin produced some good news. still some more to go to fully recover from the crash.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:44:29
yes ive been watching closely and it all seems very much orchestrated to purposedly lower the price. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:31:04
it is for me who have been stuck with money up there all this time without being able to invest it elsewhere without taking a massive loss. i understand it is my fault but i had such high expectations.. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:02:20
yes i have. have had no issues. i use cex.io exchange, but coinbase supports SEPA as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:21:53
what reasons? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:38:33
so whats the deal with BTC? aside from mooning by 2020 are you guys expecting it to keep its current downtrend?
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:43:41
because most realise bch is a scam coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:00:02
no, based on reddit hype. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:46:11
i should have accepted that job offer..
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:46:46
i know it will, that is why i have not sold. and thanks to other cryptos i am not even at a loss overall, because they have covered the difference. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:35:39
i live in Portugal and i can tell you this is an abhorrent bank to work with - slow, beaurocratic, sloppy. Closed my account with them and opened one at Millennium instead. Buying crypto curriency is not illegal in Portugal so I am glad I left them. I won't be told by a bank what i can or can't buy if I'm complying with the law. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:18:50
yes i have since learnt. thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:55:34
yes but bitcoin needs some help as well me thinks. i dont know who is responsible for it but the congestion and high fees need to go. if whoever runs this show implements sigwit or whatever to make these niuances go away i agree with you. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:06:58
Lol ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:20:18
very good. you have taken your first step into a larger world. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:16:14
they have?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:44:25
it doesnt. i refused on account of the transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:42:31
I own a total of 0 BTH coins. Never have and never will. It's a fiasco which did more harm than good imo
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:22:22
BTC might be broken but almost all crypto currencies are down - many by more than 10% since yesterday. it may be the holiday season..
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:22:44
you know its a bad day for cryptocurrencies when even ripple is down
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:43:27
i feel so powerless just watching it crash down. wish i could inject a few billions to turn it around.. but then again not sure if i would at this point
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:36:32
do you think it will recover after that?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:30
its premature. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:08
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:31:32
fine but how am i to pay for child support if it just keeps going down??
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:30:01
Hence why many think it's nothing more than a speculative bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:54:17
i think it just might.. i think PM-ME-YOUR-CONCERN is onto something even though his assessment is as good as anybody elses. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:03:01
sometimes the price chart is a bit outdated with all the trading going on.. or there might be processing charges imbedded in your purchase etc. in any event, i'd hold before buying right away. there is a downward trend going on atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:08:40
at the current transaction cost, bitcoin is useless for business. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:43:45
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:44:55
it is. what fun!
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:18:52
im using CEX.IO. you'll need to verify identity but its pretty straight forward and secure, has high caps and relatively fast service. its based in the UK. coinbase doesnt support germany i dont think. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:01:42
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:03:10
getting pretty tired of watching red lines.. thinking of selling at a loss and grinding my way up again. sucks but damn.. this never ends. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:23:26
i dont think so
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:27:41
..or know about it but dont want to pay astronomical transaction fees every other day. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:02:00
dont know it, but it looks dodgy. use this one instead which is official and does the same.

so whats the word?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:33:33
wait until its authenticated. you'll be notified. takes usually 10-15 mins. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:10:39
Hello gang ! So.. day ten of some fat speculative Korean running away with my money while I dutifully and cheerfully HODL and wave my digits goodbye for now.. I eagerly await the day when I'll reunite with them after a well-deserved vacation.. perhaps it'll be on the $30k 31st.. perhaps on the $60k January.. or maybe they'll all return with an extended 6 digit family by the end of 2018.. in the meantime I find solace in that they are making themselves useful by helping their new keeper erect more and more and higher sell walls all whilst procreating on his fertile exchange.. I'm so very happy for them, but it'll be nice to have them visit every so often as well..
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:09:48
is it  me or things were so much prettier at 19k? who are these people dumping all their BTC when they could let the market grow?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:33:56
I'm a fan but I must say I'm very disappointed with this coin's performance as of late. Any excuse is good enough for crashing it's value..
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:26:35
ya im just very frustrated..
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:31:50
Well for what it's worth I took my coins and business elsewhere. I think many other disgruntled users left coinbase over this decision.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:25
for the record, i am not selling. this will turn around. those who are in a position to buy, should buy as much as possible now. tomorrow you'll be filling your amazon carts with xmas gifts. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:01:54
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:51:54
Oh no! You were too short sighted. You might not recover your investment this week or the next but what about next month? Or in two months? You should have only bought with money you were prepared to lose..
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:12:02
Yes, more electrons..
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:10:32
It's not used as a currency any longer.. it's not financially sound most of the time. You can send it to another person on your exchange or elsewhere, but it'll be subject to the same transfer fees anytime it changes wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:06:21

@_date: 2017-12-19 14:00:14
that's rediculous. use blockchain instead. they use google as a 2FA. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:31:38
if you buy coins with CC, the transaction is instant. otherwise, afaik, all exchanges will take a few days to approve your bank deposit. yet, once you do have coins you can buy and sell immediately if you keep the fiat on the account; up to a certain amount. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:00:31
it's the boss fight!
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:08:45
exactly. just like printed money there is a supply and demand for these electrons, which determine the price. personally, i dont think itll go below 15k at this point, at least in the short term, but because there is nothing backing up this currency its all high speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:19:43
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:04:03
what kakefar said. BTC has been spiraling down for more than 10 days now.. no one really knows what the floor will be. id look at other more upbeat coins for the time being. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:15:21
No. You need to use the exchange. What you can do is buy another currency such as Ether and then transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:15:33
you need to look at the order column. wherever you see a high BTC amount being bought or sold you'll see a high horizontal block called a "wall". Basically it means many people (or someone with a lot of BTC) have placed buying or selling orders at the same price point. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:01:10
I moved my BTC to another exchange today.

@_date: 2017-12-30 14:31:53
No game. They've been explaining it here all along just you aren't paying attention.. this is a "correction". This means it's finding its new value as the newbies run for the hills.. let me explain it plainly: as the value of bitcoin skyrocketed early December and news hit the media, many people jumped onboard with little idea of what they were getting into. This brought an influx of money and inflated the value even more. 
When these people realised this is a very shady business, with an ageing technology that is practically worthless with its high fees, slow speeds and so on they became disappointed and cashed out.. and continue to do so.. it did not help that during this exodus rocket man Kim hacked an exchange in Korea, the government of Korea put bitcoin and regulation in the same sentence and BTH joined coinbase etc. All this added to the confusion and the doubt.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:01
heresy !!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:53:49
there is a fee embedded, and also coinbase has a very safe and respected architecture and charges a premium so you can sleep at night. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:00:45
alas, you are not doing anything wrong.. because of all the new demand on BTC, the network is stressed as the core technology shows its age. as a result miners, who are responsible to solve your transfer in the blockchain charge huge transfer fees. 
for that amount, best keep it on the exchange, unless you are going to lock it away for the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:31:10
in a way.. if someone hacks your account he won't be able to retrieve your BTC, and you'll get plenty of time in advance to secure it. BUT your coins are still in Coinbase, so if Coinbase goes down so do your BTC. Nothing beats keeping your coins in a cold storage. Remember you wont be able to trade BTC from your vault immediately. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:50:08
the authentication is not an issue. transaction fees are just that high. if you intend to trade regularly, you might want to consider keeping the BTC on the exchange, at a higher risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:46:49
except that you do when you are paying exorbitant fees or wait days for a transfer to go through.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:55:23
greetings sir. that was all quite fun but if you could please bring it back up to 19k ill be most obliged. thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:11:40
hahaha xd. almost there anytime now. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:47:23
it might be an issue if you intend to trade frequently as you'll be paying transaction fees from your cold storage to the exchange regularly.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:25:02
I don't think anyone knows.. up until now it was a "correction" but now that it's gone below 15k it's becoming toxic.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:10
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:32:25
to vets: are you dumping your BTC for XRP? i bought 500 ripples with BTC im debating whether i should buy even more.. thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:05:40
yes me too. most crypto currencies have had a horrid week so we'll have to wait and see. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:51:30
well they are not killing me. im HODL until hell freezes over!
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:12:49
no. deleting the app does not make your BTC address (and its funds) dissapear from the blockchain; nor does it make it a cold wallet. the app is merely the tool you use to create and access a BTC address (or any other cryptocurrency). That same address you use your BRD app can be acessed through other apps too.
The difference between that and a hardware wallet is that the hardware wallet also acts as a tool to create and access an adress and funds, and in order to interact with these addresses, you need to interact with the hardware, thereby if a hacker cannot be physically in your hardware wallet presence pressing the buttons he won't be able to move funds.
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:33:53
That's not what I am asking. What am I asking is if I need to withdraw my euros now or wait. Or if CB will sort it all out for me.
England and their pound sterling can go to hell as far as I'm concerned. Just want to know if my euros are safe now.

" I actually looked into 2FA for Exodus a while back, and saw they were thinking of implementing it, but never did "
