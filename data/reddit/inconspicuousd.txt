Genuinely curious, do you have any links talking about this drop and reasons for it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:02:45
In my defense I was only holding up the metaphor. I didn't ask for that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:29:56
Nah maybe a little over enthusiastic but that's a little far
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:48:01
Well I've been eating a whole box of crackers once a week since like October and I'm just worried that I'll start to get fat and lose myself in the process and eventually the crackers will drop in value and my investments will be losing value...
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:45:15
Also hopeful on an answer for this... GDAX has crashed like 3 times today and it seems like the servers really suck at holding the traffic
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:39:13
Haha that's hilarious dude! I do the same exact thing! Started in October and I've gained like 75 bucks off the investments I think. Glad to see I'm not the only one 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:35:20
I feel ya dude, I bought another .003, 3 days ago at $36 and already made 9 bucks off it... it's getting toasty in here.

Convert to Etherium and cash out, otherwise proxys are your friend *allegedly*
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:26:14
It was pretty funny. Pretty sure I saw a purchase of 128 btc right before it crashed
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:57:53
I don't like answers like that. It's threads like these that give people a great understanding of bitcoin and maybe some insight they might not find in articles or basic tutorials. This sub should be welcoming and not shit on every new person who's just curious. No need to belittle.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:33:08
Well you can't deny we're on pace 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:25:36
I wouldn't go that far but !!!!!! Holy shit this is incredible!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:23
You are correct. We post on the hundreds.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:41:14
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:46:01
Excellent counter argument. I will consider this when weighing out my options.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:41:33
Fuck... idk man cuz I want to
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:51:19
Will Coinbase open their exchange to b cash? Where will I be able to access it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:51:42
Think I'll just hodl and buy 2 in like a week
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:06:25
What are the chances we regain our footing in the next 24 hours?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:40:41
Oh c'mon give a little more credit... the nut is ongoing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:41:42
Anytime my dude
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:08:02
Just giving me anxiety 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:57:58
As long as you own your own keys you're straight 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:06:48
Minor dip maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:14:30
Haha honestly you're right. Yeah don't worry I only invest what I can afford to lose but still, today taught me a valuable lesson to calm down.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:04:07
I was just under the impression from this sub that GDAX is more accurate and all around better.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:07:45
Haven't studied up on it much just following the trends but that makes sense, ok.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:37:58
The moon restores its strength the closer we get to it
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:18:31
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:08:56
Jesus really? Can you send me a link to where you're seeing the feed?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:07:07
Think I'm gonna do that
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:09:29
Ok and would you recommend this or me holding what I have now?
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:17:05
Well personally speaking, as the price goes down so does my bank account...
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:27:00
Hey man, we're all going to the moon, just trying to help out where I can!
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:31:13
I hear you loud and clear, is Blockchain a good option?
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:05:50
It's vague but what is the result of doing so after the fork? What will happen to my bitcoin and what will I be missing out on?
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:10:21
Wait a day or 2 for when it dips again. It always happens right after.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:25:46
It means I'm either really smart or dumb as hell... I'll let you know in a year.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:29:23
6500 within the next 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:35:36
If we're lucky we'll see it go up past 6,000 again tonight .
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:48:55
Where in Florida? I'm pissed I didn't here about this
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:14:25
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:01:53
Invest in bitcoin first, make a sizable profit, then take out what you need for mining.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:51:02
Oh my god this just keeps getting worse... east campus?
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:28:07
Love me some Philly D
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:40:45
Lol you made me realize how dumb of a question I asked. Hodl is the move. We're going to the moon!
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:31:40
GOD DAMMIT, how close to University?
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:26:05
Always only temporary
