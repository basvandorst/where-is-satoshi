I think the pricing is fine. It might not be the most accurate, but it's still cool to be able to tip like that. Thanks a lot for the buds!

If this research is crowd-funded it should be public domain and unpatentable.

Of course he's billionaire rich from other people's money. Was it really stupid?

So how do you break news of incompetence to someone while being "nice"? Is being nice just ignoring the obvious lack of security that is happening so it can just keep happening?

Ya, I don't imagine when he looked for the programmer that he knew the site would blow up like it did. But damn it looked like it was easy to do. Of course it could all be lies put forth by LEO to put us off the real trail. What if silk road was a giant honey pot from the start and these rookie mistakes were done intentionally to make it seem like it was all done by excellent sleuths?

Do you have any more information about Tim May, or his prediction? I would like to read up on him but lots of Tim May's come up on google.

It's a very general rule. I used to work tech support at BlackBerry, and we had lots of tools to check mail servers for people wanting their own email on their BlackBerry. We needed user's passwords to use the tools. I never felt right asking, but sometimes there just was no choice. There is only so much information that an untrained user calling tech support can offer. I probably got 2 or 3 passwords a day.

I had two great experience with localbitcoins.com. I bought bitcoins both times and did it with a bank transfer, but it was really fast, less than 90mins total including my drive to two different banks. I won't use anything else any more. I used to use cavirtex.ca when they allowed direct bank deposits. It took about 6 hours to get my coins then. Now they don't even allow direct deposits and it takes 2-3 days to get your coins.
Localbitcoins.com is the best, I hope they do really well.

Small claims court. Sue them for the amount of this transaction, and for lost income because they did not do due diligence before reversing your funds. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 03:21:27
He was selling mining rigs. Wouldn't that mean that they would at least know a little something about bitcoin if they bought a mining rig?
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:27:29
Oh that is a good point... They could put up a false key to encrypt the message with, intercept the message, decrypt and read it, then re-encrypt with the proper key. I don't know if people would notice that their PGP key was different on their vendor page than what it really is.
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:39:42
So awesome that you are there with Patrick Stewart.

Ya there are other sites already lining up to take over for SR. I think people will be cautious at first though because some could be honeypots. There is one called sheep something or other. This seems like something the feds would put up in a sting operation "watch how the junkies follow like sheep" kind of thing. I never used sr, though I have browsed it many times. I find it hard trust people i don't know and can't see with my money. Besides, there's lots of cheaper weed here in my hometown and I don't have to wait weeks to get it.
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:55:29
One thing to remember though is that with those 8million BTC of sales, a lot of those bitcoins were used more than once, so we can't really say that silk road accounted for 2/3 of the bitcoins on the market.
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:57:03
Yup, you called it.
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:54:07
There are plenty of other sites that sell drugs for bitcoins and litecoins.

Maybe so, but when I am on the other end of the phone and you start expressing your anger to me for something that I didn't do, I will still do my job to help but I won't do anything extra. I have seen people who were in bad situations who explained to me calmly and got me on their side. These are the types of people I went the extra mile for and got them what they needed.
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:08:01
Man if it goes down to $20 I am getting 50 of them.
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:40:47
Are your calculations for 2gh/sec or for the 7.6 total? I'm just curious because I saw a post on another board about someone getting an ati card and he was all gung ho on making so many bc. How many gh/sec would a good video card do?
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:43:38
But what if the time it took to shut it down was fully intentional. Why shut down a single web site when you can get the web site and a bunch of vendors and buyers but getting full access to said website, and snooping all the communication.
I went on silk road a few times out of curiosity sake but luckily i haven't purchased anything, so at most they have my ip browsing the site and that's only if they have compromised the tor network as well (which is most likely the case, even though wishful thinking people seem to think it is impossible).
@_date: 2013-06-18 03:24:48
Well i can side with the seller here for one reason. $1300 is not a small sum of money. To just reverse it without any sort of investigation is irresponsible on paypal's part. At the very least, it should be tied up pending an investigation.
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:13:31
ya that is a good point, people who used vendors before and had their keys saved would notice. Im sure it's comforting for some people.
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:55:59
Ya, it's almost "too perfect" for leo.
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:30:31
What he means though is this:
Vendor puts his public key on his vendor page.
Someone with full access to the server replaces this key with another public key that they have the private key for and saves the public key of the vendor.
when a message is passed, man in the middle intercepts the message, decrypts and reads it, then re-encrypts with the vendors actual public key and sends it along.
This way it is possible, however it would have to mean that no vendor has noticed having a different public key on their vendor page than they have in their pgp program.

So this guy is talking something like a year before he mines a single coin then?
@_date: 2013-10-01 23:24:17
There was a story not long ago about a bunch of counterfeit 100s going around and I thought it was the new ones, but apparently it was the last series of paper bills. Not sure if that is the same story you heard or not, but it was quite unclear. I had to google the series number on the rcmp release to find out it wasn't the new ones.
@_date: 2013-06-30 18:01:49
I agree. I was at BlackBerry just before the iPhone came out and for 2 years after, so like 2007-2009 or something. Hopefully they have better tools in place now.

There is no difference. The drugs still come from the same places.

I know where you are coming from with your rationalization but looking at it from the eyes of law abiding joe q public, someone threatened a drug king pin to expose his customers to the police so that they could be arrested for their crimes. What your saying is the same as saying it's ok for a mafia boss to kill an informant or a witness because "he fired the first shots".
@_date: 2013-10-02 00:57:47
Wow, amazing really.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:56:42
That's some fine coding skills you have there, lou. Unfortunately you forgot the quotes around the $100, so now you are infinitely printing out an unassigned string.

Once they had his identity/identities they just needed to find out where he spent his money for hosting. Then subpoena the host, and take the servers. Just a guess on my part though.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:29:46
I'm not saying that at all. My example with the mafia was  a bad one, my point is that this is no different than killing a witness or informant.

Why would it be an int and not a bool? Hrm maybe that's early C?

Never worked customer service, eh? "raise your voice"? Horrible advice. As soon as you lose your cool, you will lose the cooperation of the customer service agent helping you. You aren't talking to paypal, you're talking to a human being that is paid to answer their phones, and should be treated like a human being, even if they chose to work for such an evil corporation.

* Oh wow, I am surprised that the new bills are able to be counterfeited so quickly. Well not really surprised I guess, but I thought it would be a lot harder to clone them.
