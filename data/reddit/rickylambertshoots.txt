I am not talking about Bitcoin Exchange Ltd. I am sat outside their offices in Petworth. They run bit121. 
bicoinexchangeltd.com and bitcoin2pocket.com claim to work from here, they don't. They are scam sites, they do not sell bit coins, they buy them, but dont pay. They are using identity theft.
They then appear to post on here saying how wonderful they are. They would, wouldnt they. 
Please call them, phone does not work. Ask them to describe their surroundings, not a clue. Check their domains. Do a bit of research. Try Jim iddiols, try Tork.
For Christs sake, how much proof do you want.
I will not post on this thread again, as I guess the responses are from the twat running the scam, under various log ins.
I have informed the police, google (they run an adwords campaign) and have reported to verisign.
Good luck people.

2 scam sites discovered.
bitcoingexchangeltd.com (reg with Go Daddy)
bitcoin2pocket.com (re with enom)
both using the same legitimate company name and address of Bitcoin Exchange Ltd copied from the bit121.co.uk site
Very simple but effective scam. You send him bitcoins, he sends you nothing.
Police aware and working on tracing, but could be anywhere in the world. Please message me if you have any ideas.

Tallit, please do not give this guy any chances. His chat system is single user and free, he is the only guy!

This is corporate identity theft.  is not owned by Bitcoin Exchange Ltd nor based at Petworth.
It is using this name and address and scamming people to send them bit coins.
The same guy, I suspect, is running bitcoin2pocket.com
Bitcoin Exchange Ltd runs bit121.com, which is a perfectly legit business and its reg office is in Petworth.
Go on to bitcoinexchangeltd and engage the guy in live chat, ask him what is outside his window, he wont have a clue. he could be sat in Panama.
He is surely having a laugh.
His domains are hosted by godaddy and enom who have been informed, no respone as yet. The scams have been reported to actionfraud at the City of London Police.
If anybody has any ideas how to trace the guy and close him down please post here.

I know the company and the address. 
The twat running this scam cannot be found there.
Sell him a fraction of a bit coin and see if he pays you.
He has scammed a few guys, hopefully this might get around before he gets any more.

I contacted google and told them scammers are running an adwords campaign, no response, ads still appearing this morning. I think you might all see the real status of some of the posters on here, they are part of the fraud.
Called Action Fraud this morning and had a long chat with a girl who said they take 2000 calls a day and the chances of the police taking action is slim. So I guess bitcoinexchangeltd.com and bitcoin2pocket (same guys) will continue collecting peoples bitcoins with impunity. Strange world.
