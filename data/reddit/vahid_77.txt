Remind me to steer away from that site for info because they evidently know this scene - nOT! The last thing we need is a panic... People thinking that bitcoin has competition, because it doesn't, it never did. LTC and FTC were created to compliment BTC, not to compete. Altcoins worth 10 times less, collectively, than bitcoins is not competing with bitcoin... against each other, sure. But no altcoin should have so much confidence that it considers itself competition -at least none out there now can. 
OP, is this article written by you? If not, please remove this garbage... It's confusing the noobs and those already confused. If this was written by you, after removing this thread please educate your a little bit more before making a claim like this.

He's the guy in control of the countries budgets. he is the one that says that social security gets X amount this year, military gets Y amounts this year and healthcare gets Z.... oh and the guy that ensures he receives A, B and C amounts.
in short he is the accountant/book keeper of the government funding (tax)

This is probably as close as we are going to get to a country adopting a crypto as an "official" currency (even though it isn't a crypto in the Bitcoin sense of the word).
Governments by nature don't like things that they cannot control and profit off of.  Governments operate off of the hard work and tax dollars of its citizens, and Bitcoin takes a good portion of that away from them...

I am following this topic. "Simply turn it off" means what? I don't think so.
