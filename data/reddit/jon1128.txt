I'm going by [California Penal Code § 502]( here but you should be able to take legal action, if you wish to do so.
[hopefully of some help..]
" (1) Knowingly accesses and without permission alters, damages,
deletes, destroys, or otherwise uses any data, computer, computer
system, or computer network in order to either (A) devise or execute
any scheme or artifice to defraud, deceive, or extort, or (B)
wrongfully control or obtain money, property, or data. "
" Any person who violates any of the provisions of paragraph
(1), (2), (4), or (5) of subdivision (c) is punishable by a fine not
exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by imprisonment
pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 for 16 months, or two or
three years, or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by a fine not
exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by imprisonment in a
county jail not exceeding one year, or by both that fine and
imprisonment. "

Of course, I was merely trying to get appropriate information that may help when/if you have the necessary details to actually do something against that person.
I do wish ya the best of luck with getting everything sorted, hopefully things'll end in your favor.

I couldn't say, don't know anything about it myself.
Even if they are, if the guy is in the states he's subject to those laws not the laws of whatever country the servers are in.
