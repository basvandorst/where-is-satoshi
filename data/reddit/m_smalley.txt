My follow up blog post to disclose what took place in the first 24 hours -

They see long-term potential in a marketplace for modules. The words first fully-featured module web-wallet has a good chance of making a success of optional subscription based modules...
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:34:27
The technical introduction can be read here - 
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:12:00
Yes, correct - no Bitcoins are stored anywhere. Forget your password and you've lost everything!
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:03:44
Are there any particular pieces of the puzzle you need more / first?
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:45:48
Seems the IRS are inconsistent with their approach. There were some members in our batch that got EIN immediately and a few others that didn't. Not having a SSN did not help matters either...
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:20:01
This issue has now been resolved ...
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:22:05
Thanks for pointing out - will double check my floats (the balance is being drawn from the blockchain.info API) 
@_date: 2014-05-29 06:29:16
Please let me know when you're next down, big fan of cheeseburgers. Presume you're located in SF...?
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:11:25
Glad you approved and remember and thanks for votes of confidence! That initial version has become the foundation for Neuroware. We're now working on v2, which will introduce themes and plugins too, not to mention multiple currencies and our own APIs (no longer requiring blockchain.info).
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:25:29
Check the source code - or install Firebug and view the external calls being made. OpenSource FTW.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:25:28
Another part of the chain (hidden from initial user view) is that it uses the current URL to help wade off rainbow attacks. There is also an option to use a random salt when first creating the account and this adds a LOT more security. Have left weak defaults in place so that testing is easy :p
More importantly, by keeping everything 100% deterministic, you can then recreate the same wallets in any other hosted version of the app - making each app like a universal ATM to your own coins... I need to write some more blog posts when I get a chance...
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:18:27
Me too :-)
I'm currently knee-deep in the front-end APIs whilst Adam is churning through the back-end APIs and we'll be meeting-up in the middle soon. Speaking of which, Dogecoin support is not far off now.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:05:29
More lively discussions happening over on this other thread in relation to how cannot be banned by Apple - 
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:38:47
If you've got a spare room, I'd be happy to help the community at large by moving in with you and reducing the ludicrous rental cost here...
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:34:11
That's excellent news - what's the company name? Are you at the Sunnyvale one? Hope to bump into you at the next meetup
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:28:13
That's the point - host it anywhere you like - even tucked away on your own onion domain through TOR (even more difficult to use rainbow attack vectors).
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:38:25
Initial reason for doing this was to try and land a job - will make things more serious if and when the project matures, but for now, I just wanted to turn a few heads and show what's possible
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:09:08
Yeah, good point - we go into a little more detail about that in one of our recent blog posts - 
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:30:20
Mozilla will always have a very special place in my heart and soul. If all goes to shit here in the valley I'll be trying again for a 3rd time.
@_date: 2014-05-29 05:21:38
I feel your pain. This place is amazing. I hope we don't fuck it up for you. Also hope you can put this - $1.49 to some good use. Not sure if you're new to Bitcoin or not, but it's all I currently have spare at the moment :-)
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:31:26
That's funny :-) We were just talking yesterday about whether anyone would find out the truth! Glad you came back and saw the results - thanks again for that first bump, it really did change my life. Hope I get the chance to shake your hand. May the force be with you!
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:02:48
Totally agree - which was why I pushed to launch this thing as early (and as beta) as possible, so people could see that we do not even need Apple's permission anyway, and truth be known, it's probably for a good reason really, but that's a whole other discussion for a whole other forum :p
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:26:44
You know more than I do :-) Rather than learn, I'd practice by building.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:22:22
Peercoin looks like it could be integrated quite easily because there is a lot of JS work be done already for it, but divide the altcoin donations into individual altcoins and donations in those coins to better gauge market interest.
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:47:43
The condition for getting the initial funds was that we relocate to the US for 3 months to take part in the 500 Startups Accelerator.
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:56:11
If you've got your idea - I'd definitely recommend applying to 500 startups. Today is the last day for Batch 10 applications -  - may the force be with you!
@_date: 2014-02-10 09:35:29
VeryLongSentence is already present through passphrase - the URL is not an issue when considering it can be hosted anywhere, including a self-hosted .onion domain running through TOR which would be much more secure that a VeryLongSentence ...
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:33:00
My first tip! A thousand thanks. Can't wait to find someone or something to pay it forward with...
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:30:14
I hear good things about HoneyBadgr but haven't personally used them or met the team yet -  -Coinality took an active role in the recent Bitcoin Job Fair - 
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:55:13
We'll be rapidly expanding very soon. Hope you can take the time to sign-up on our website and indicate your interest and we can take it from there.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:22:23
Both this and Coinpunk can be downloaded and hosted anywhere you like. The thing that makes this one different is that you do not even need to have a server! It does NOT require PHP or NodeJS or anything like that. Can even be hosted from your desktop, on a Onion domain or from GitHub.
@_date: 2014-05-29 05:24:35
By default, they are not stored anywhere as they are generated deterministically within the browser using compound encryption at the point of transaction and (or) set-up. However, the encryption process is also module so you can add-in server-side processing and other 3rd party reliance or recovery services if required.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:37:20
Lots of heavy JS files included (not optimized or consolidated yet) so its bit of a heavy load. Will be clearing this up in future releases should the project be of interest to anyone...
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:20:20
Not only can you host the wallet yourself - even from your desktop, but you can also backup wallets as soon as you have created them and keep a QR copy or text version of the private keys for each wallet that you test. These keys can then be imported into almost any other wallet - they are by NO means locked-in to any one device or any one wallet...
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:41:00
It uses "rawtransactions" - they are relayed via BlockChain.info - the next version will allow you to choose other API end-points, but for now, everything goes through blockchain.info
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:23:45
This really means a lot to me - thanks for taking the time to notice. Tried looking for you on Twitter to no luck. Gracias!
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:27:51
Me too man - thanks for working with us - pleasure to have you participating in our private beta batch ...
@_date: 2014-11-21 02:41:07
Yes, with SSN its easy. As a foreigner without an SSN its not quite as simple.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:39:55
Will be the first to admit it needs work and is VERY beta. The URL is sanity checked in some cases and providing additional two factor-auth is on the list to be added later should there be enough interest in the project...
@_date: 2014-02-10 09:34:23
You can host it anywhere you like
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:25:39
We don't plan on really selling anything. Our wallets and other crypto based applications will be freely available to download, tweak and redistribute as your own under [MIT licenses]( 
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:22:01
Thanks for re-posting with the "no-ban" take on things - WOW, such upvotes - much good :-)
I'm Mark, lead developer of BrainControl - will try to answer any questions anyone might have...
@_date: 2014-11-21 03:40:13
Thanks for catching us this time - let me know if you have any questions
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:50:13
I messed-up upon initial arrival and had just a waiver. This is not good enough for establishing a business / participating in an accelerator and led to a LOT of problems. Nonetheless, after returning to the UK and having several interviews there I now have a B1 Visa.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:04:27
You could always download the source code, see for yourself and then host it whether you like making whatever additional modifications you need. I have OpenSourced the web-app, the WordPress theme, the FirefoxOS App, the Windows Desktop client and the MacOSX desktop client...
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:54:22
Thanks - it wasn't my post, the title for that was not catchy, the title for this one seemed much more popular :p
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:32:56
Indeed it would - thanks for noticing! :-)
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:52:48
WOW, two tips in one day. Maybe its time for me to pivot. Thanks for such a cool startup / mechanism for encouraging engagement.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:36:15
Me too - and I built it! :-)
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:28:27
Wish I shared your optimism - feels like I'm months behind :-s
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:38:14
The main BrainControl website is meant as a mock-umentary styled look at things, whereas the blog post at Betanomics takes a more serious technical approach - 
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:20:29
So long as you have a working prototype of some description, that's all the Bitcoin companies need for 500.co - it's not like the non Bitcoin companies, where proven traction is already expected. Nonetheless, having too many ideas can be a distraction too. It's not easy picking just one, I definitely know how that feels.
@_date: 2015-05-12 02:13:04
You did an awesome job of keeping the technical and marketing teams aligned. Couldn't have been smoother!
