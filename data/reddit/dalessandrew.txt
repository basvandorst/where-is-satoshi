You can always try making a website where you sell goods you buy for people with your money and they pay you in BTC. This way there's no link between your money and the bitcoins but you get bitcoins and people bought stuff from you in BTC.

I believe what he is saying is that BCC will be identical to BTC up until the "forking" point but it is essentially an entirely separate network from the original BTC. The entire community is highly unlikely to adopt BCC unanimously. That's why he refers to BCC as an altcoin (which in essence it is).

This BCC "fork" is somewhat news to me but I'll try and answer your question anyhow. If I'm wrong or ambiguous someone more knowledgeable can chime it. Here goes... BCC is not actually a real fork but more of an altcoin. It is essentially a clone of BTC up to the "forking point" after which BTC rules no longer apply and BCC rules enact. If you want to use BCC you will need to download BCC compatible wallet and upload your wallet to it. This way you will have BCC. Keep in mind that you will have both BCC and BTC in separate client wallets. Also, the community is unlikely to unanimously adopt BCC.. similarly to Bitcoin ultimate/unlimited/whatever other "fork/altcoin" there has been that failed. So technically you should be able to dump all your BCC for whatever little it will be worth and keep your valuable BTC no problem.

The green line shows a steady growth up to 100$. Then bitcoin hit a price spike up to +140$ and is now being corrected back to 110-115$ where the projected green line would go if it was lengthened. I consider the +140$ peak to be an erroneous point and the trend line demonstrates that!
Granted, MtGox was lagging a whole lot today and people are much too reliant on that single exchange. There are many other exchanges out there that are just as reliable as Gox.
The instawallet thing was just a prime example of why one should keep their bitcoins in cold storage or at least on a client with a nice long encrypted password.

They can always switch to Atlantis or BMR. Which some might already be doing. Hopefully the gox/coinlab situation blows over and they settle out of court.

This is great! I can't wait to fill up my tank using bitcoins! How long is delivery time?

After a stressful couple of days it really takes the edge off.

Yea especially with the growing number of transactions due to bitcoins mainstream adoption. The blockchain will become huge one day. Maybe the decreasing price per GB of storage will off set the concerns regarding the growing size of the blockchain. Who knows? Only time will tell.

If you have an account at mtgox or coinlab or any other exchange you can buy bitcoins there and simply send them to your personal wallet. Then send those to cavirtex and sell for a profit. Then cash out, and repeat. For this to be quick you'd need to already have fiat in a few different exchanges. I've done this a few times and sometimes even through different currencies (euro, aus, etc.) It can be very profitable if you're prepared.
Like today for example I bought ~3 bitcoins from coinlab and sold them for 50$ more on cavirtex then direct deposit to my account which cavirtex is real quick about doing. I'm buying a set of tires with it and its costing me 250$ less!

Don't quote me on this but I think the smaller trades have small bubbles and a higher pitch while the larger trades have bigger bubbles and a deeper tone.

That might work, if you know what you doing. I find my best strategy so far is holding. Day-trading takes experience, good gut feeling and a little luck to be profitable.

Libertybit.com has trading fees set at 0.5% but they have a much smaller trading volume
