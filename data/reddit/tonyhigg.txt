Do u honestly believe that central governments will allow btc or any similar payment layer / Token, to openly operate in a completely private, anonomous  layer??? Sure the technology is there, lightning demonstrates this. Logic would dictate that if btc becomes a store of value or a transactional layer within the current monetory system, governments will insist on knowing who’s transacting  , No matter how much anonimity we build in , identification of who spends the money will always be a part of the regulatory requirements , Do u see this differently??

Bitcoin with lightning will allow a network of centralized  control, as the protocol layer, will be a single point of entry, Once most blockchains can interact via side chains , can u imagine the amount of  control governments will have ?? .Using id verification, kyc/ aml  platforms such as the key &amp; civic  or similar, we will all be reduced simply to a digital id , You will either be compliant or not !!!  , should u wish not to be compliant your’e access to the interconnected blockchain/ internet of things will simply be disabled. I am a huge supporter of btc but somehow i don’t for one second think the federal reserve banks driven by insatiable greed of the elite few will accept the formation of a new monetary paradigm  without having total control over it . At the end of the day it all comes down to absolute control of the monetory  system, without this ,world governments are powerless
