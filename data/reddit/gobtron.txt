My kind of TA

But paying 1.5$ fees to buy 4 bananas is quite a good reason to use cash instead of Bitcoin. Paying 50$ to transfer 5000$ is a good reason to use Bitcoin. Maybe IOTA or NANO are better for the bananas use case though.

But why 2k19 instead of 2019?

Well, this is why you need to have backups including one off-site. I'm sorry for your loss, this must be heart-breaking :(

You mean "chaos", not "anarchy".

Oh! I think I am misinformed then!

I guess this is why feeless/mining-less coins like NANO or IOTA are interesting. At least for now.

Yes, but at some point you have to close the channel and process and confirm on chain and pay the fees? So if I buy something once at a random store I will have to pay fees/wait for confirmations. Not trying to discredit Bitcoin here, being able to tranfer millions or bilions around the planet securely in a few minutes for like 2$ fees is awesome! I just think cryptocurrencies in general are not there YET for the coffee transaction. Maybe I am misinformed about LN, that's why NANO/IOTA seems appealing to me for that use case.

I ate struggled eggs this morning.

Well I could have had the money if I decided it was a priority. But at that time, I preferred buying food, paying my bills, and spare the rest just in case.

What? There was an airdrop? To everyone holding Bitcoin Cash I suppose?
@_date: 2019-04-15 14:52:38
Didn't have money to spend on Bitcoin when it was 5-10$.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:24:55
I thought you were growing plants because of those green wires

Hi! I think you mean chaos, not anarchy.
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:27:42
Yeah I dumped my bcash a long time ago.
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:16:03
That is some nice industrial ecology here.
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:00:07
Maybe fuck Bitpay, but fuck the payments processors in general. Defeats the purpose of Crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:38:50
I hate that also.
