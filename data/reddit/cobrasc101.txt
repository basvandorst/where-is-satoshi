Use coinbase, yes.

I'll be a little less diplomatic. 
Are you fucking high?

No, people, this is not the Onion.

Fake concern post by Circle employee.

Rofl, look at these guys trying to introduce temporary volatility to make little moves in the market. 
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere or forking. Daytraders, on the other hand, are a dime a dozen, isn't that right, vinny?
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:41:09
This isn't happening. It's a fantasy of people like Roger Ver. 
Don't worry about it.

Bitcoin is a sweaty sock. Why? I don't know, mebbe cuz I'm running out of intellectual-sounding metaphors.
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:53:45
But this is a made up, bullshit potemkin creation.
This is just Vinny's attempt to get a few shorts in on this volatility and sentiment.
The typical scummy, scammy daytrader stuff.
Bitcoin is NOTHING like eth, and nowhere near as immature.
Bitcoin was never in any real danger of forking seriously, and everyone knows this. The arguments of a bunch of neckbeards on Reddit does not a bitcoin hardfork make. And please don't even mention XT or unlimited. I don't count those pathetic attempts at remaking bitcoin as serious.

He has no interest in fostering the growth of stateless money. 
Take everything he says as an outright lie. This is the best way to understand politicians. 
That or prep yourself by watching the full seasons of House of Cards.

Not a goddamn chance.
Nice try, though. And appropriate timing to advance your agenda!
@_date: 2016-07-15 18:43:18
Please go away.

What the hell is going on with the comment count?
@_date: 2016-07-17 14:09:09
Don't give him the clicks.

Stop dallying and get it. I use it for a large stack. No issues.

To be fair, Mycelium essentially begs you to copy down your backup phrase when you created your wallet on install...

Oh look let's blindly bash Coinbase because, ya know, they write the laws and regulations in the US..
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:15:08
Don't try to think, just accept the good news and pump up the price a little bit until the next "Russian finance ministry purposes bill limiting Bitcoin" or whatever sundry clickbait Bitcoin journalism title.
It's a constant push and pull designed to keep you misinformed and seeking validation and new information.
I'm beginning to think that these"bitcoin journalists"are nothing more than pumpers and dumpers.

Oh look, the spooks at the NSA are bored again.. time to sow dissent in the bitcoin space with retarded "opinions".

What the hell is wrong with people here. Seriously jumping to conclusions from one unfounded peter todd post.
Give Coinbase some credit.

Not so much on the desktop. They use the web. And what about mobile?
