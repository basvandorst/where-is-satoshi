Yeah, my wife wanted a new car.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:51:19
That's the trouble though, that cash you paid with was debt.  I'm glad you won, but others lost.
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:00:51
It already collapsed.  The governments just stole money from us to prop them up.  Didn't you notice?

Highly unlikely we'll *ever* see 5k again
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:05:54
Nope.  The CIA, NSA and FED do all that electronically. :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:42:02


You said it yourself.
They couldn't enforce regulations on it without breaching their own ECHR
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:16:07


This is one of the most asinine sentences I have ever put myself through.
Fiat is **not** money.  It's *currency*.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:10:08
It's not a flaw.  It's a *design*.  
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:18:09
Nope, pure crypto exchange.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:28:59
3k?  Hahaha, 3k is as good as zero as all the miners will pack up.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:04:30
The FED owns the entire western world.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:03:43

1. Find out and grasp in your own mind exactly what it is.
2. Decide for yourself if this is something you or the world will want/need/use.
3. Buy in or don't.

@_date: 2018-03-09 15:37:53
I didn't say Bitcoin was money.  Nice strawman though.
I simply pointed out that your assertion that fiat "money", which loses value over time faster than any other commodity I can think of apart from fucking tulips, was asinine.
Fiat money, pinned to the fucking US dollar, is a massive unlubed buttfuck to mankind, and the sooner you learn that the better off you will be.
And if you think it's "government money" you really are screwed.
Have a nice day.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:23:18
Got to start somewhere.

What a great idea
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:17:04
Same way they thought motorcars were a joke.  Aeroplanes. Television. Computers.  Mobile phones.  The internet. 
*Most* of humanity aren't generally accepting of new ideas; they are small minded and have a herd mentality. Smaller groups of humans are the other way inclined and they come up with mad ideas which change the world.
If you don't see what's coming you're not watching very carefully.
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:00:29
Which is a *function* of a fiat monetary system. Take a long hard look at the big picture..
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:10:56
Wait what.  TA is *causing* the price to drop?
Stop doing TA then.
And there's me thinking it was falling because bears were selling.
Bitcoin is worth what someone will pay you for it.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:18:50
Quite normal for scamcoins to be trashtalked though, especially BCrash
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:45:30
LOL whut.  If this breaks 10,400 I'll be astonished. Astounded even.
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:40:01
BTrash should just carry on trending to zero BTC, preferably a little faster than it is.
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:58:20
And so the beat goes on.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:34:50
Volume is up all over the place in fairness.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:07:56
Anyone saying that in December was a n00b.
It was 2 X parabolic.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:36:38
I think you massively underestimate the amount of support at 5k for starters.
I have already told you this is not a crash, but you don't seem to want to listen.
I have tried to find a single credible trader who agrees with you, and guess what, I can't.
9k will be the test, break that and we're looking at a bull, drop from there might hit 5k before another bounce.
The bulls are looking strong though, and volume is climbing by the hour.
But hey, what do I know, I am not a God.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:33:38
Get outta here with your logic.
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:05:40
It's also entirely possible BTC will never dip under 10k ever again, ever.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:50:17
The average American pays $280,000 in interest in a lifetime.
Just think about that for a minute.
And try and tell me interest is not a function of fiat currency.
It's hard to critically assess a system which has surrounded you since birth.  Most people can't buy a home without *someone else*  creating "money" out of thin air and charging them "money" for doing so.
The fiat system is absurd.  It has to go.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:43:22
Holy fuck, what odds you giving me?

@_date: 2018-02-22 13:08:14
Is it fuck.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:11:28
This is not a crash.
This was not a sudden and dramatic collapse in price, it's been a fairly steady and controlled descent.
As for the current bounce; there's shit tons of volume past 24/48 hours.
Are we out of the bear completely, possibly not, but 4k?  
You have no idea what you're rabbiting on about, and likely hold about 0.001 coins anyway.

Hahaha, Theodora appeared on the scene about 6 months ago (My wife is a domme).  She makes nothing like that amount but she is good at publicity.
Oh, and Theodora isn't a findom either, she's a clip-selling slapper who doesn't dominate anyone.
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:08:48
This statement makes the asinine assumption that the huge parabolic spike before that 50% drop was anything close to normal growth.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:25:13
A crash is a sudden catastrophic event.  You claim to have been "making $$$ on the way down".  
You don't make $$$ on the way down in a crash, you lose a shit-ton in moments.
Call it a crash if you like, it's just a bear market.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:25:25
Actually it matters a great deal.
Whales can change the fiat value of BTC, but they cannot control its supply and by doing so enslave us.

2. I'd love to see Cryptocurrencies become the next giant leap for mankind, freeing us from the drudgery of the enslaving fiat model
3. I laugh.  Directly in their faces.
4. **Fuck no**, I bill them vast sums with which I can buy.....*more Bitcoin*.
My contracts are with an actual worthwhile gov agency that directly saves lives, so my conscience is clear.

Sod Coinbase.  Move your shiz over to Gdax (or another exchange) and you can plan any buy/sell levels, plug them in with stops and go to bed.

@_date: 2018-02-07 13:00:38
You're an obnoxious little cunt.
While you've been slagging off anyone who comes near you BTC has broken a key resistance and is heading for 9k fast.
You provided no evidence, you wave economic papers around as if you wrote them, which is a direct appeal to authority and to defend that you quote a very poor article from nearly 2 decades ago.
You're rude because you're a spoiled little shit and you think it's acceptable to treat everyone around you with contempt.
And if you sold on Christmas Eve as you claim, prove it, show us the transaction.  THAT would be evidence.  All the rest; it's just shouting.
Oh and one last thing.  Brown?  YOU'RE FUCKING ENGLISH.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:15:39
That's some high quality FUD right there
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:34:43
I need evidence to think now?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:17:11
If it breaks 9k I'd say it's a pretty decent spot.

@_date: 2018-02-07 11:43:15

Actually it's why we are all enslaved.
Fiat currency is a fucking abomination.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:05:52
Then a court somewhere, might, *if he had a solid case*, find in his favour and order you to pay him in fiat.  Still, your new key would prevent the coins being taken away.
I doubt this has been tested though.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:05:47
Interesting.  When did you move to the US?
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:38:22
I'm all for a bit of TA, but TA doesn't suggest any of this bollocks.
BTC broke its downtrend channel, corrected a bit and is now forming a nice inverse head and shoulders on the daily. The bulls are in.
I apologise, I don't know what came over me there.  It just slipped out.
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:24:55
The US is not the world. US GDP?  Try Global GDP.  Suddenly it's 17%
Then try understanding Bitcoin. And understanding market cap of gold is roughly 10% of nominal global GDP.
Is he overly full of it, yes, but no more so than you.
Also worthy of note is that China will have a larger GDP by 2020 than the US.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:57:07
When or where or if I went to university really isn't something I shout about, online or otherwise.

Correction:  I did not call peer reviewed papers anything at all; I called your argument an appeal to authority, which is exactly what it was.

You'd be the de facto owner, and as soon as you relocated them you'd own them beyond anyone's reach.
Doesn't mean the actual buyer wouldn't turn up and murder you though.
