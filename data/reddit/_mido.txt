Is it a lie tho?

This thread is such a FUD. They aren't AGAINST Segwit2x. They didn't state their view, they are neutral. Otherwise - sources or gtfo.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:45:07
Thanks. 1 thing I don't understand - why does this paper say that 1 mB block causes 20% drop off?
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:41:15
Luke thinks the block limit is too big should be should be 300 kb. Do you agree with him?
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:39:16
Cuz I copy-pasted it from a thread I created a few days ago, gosh...
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:22:18
Let's say two chains without replay protection after the split exist and I want to dump coins on one of the chains without touching coins on the second chain. Is there a way to do that?
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:30:29

No one cared about UASF. They had no hash power.

And you're dumb.

Good idea. Let's make clear how little hashrate doesn't support Segwit2X.

Is it that simple? Can I create a fork myself (and lower difficulty so I can mine it myself on my CPU/GPU) and steal people's bitcoins? I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:45:50
I guess they mean Keepkey by that. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:39:48
Yeah, I meant Mbps. Thanks

Wouldn't be so sure. In PoS the richer you are, the more power you have.

Which ones?
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:45:03
What about 10 kb block? Even faster propagation.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:52:45
I see many people who suddenly want to reject 2X part of Segwit2X, so I decided to write this text because I feel like your memory isn't really good.
A few months ago miners were divided between Segwit with 1 MB block and Bitcoin Unlimited with no Segwit and no block limit (default limit 16 MB, but can be increased in the future). To finally get out of this stalemate **and avoid chain split**, miners organised a conference in New York where they decided that they will create Segwit2X = Segwit with 2 MB block limit. **That's the compromise.** [Segwit2X has ~92% support.]( A few % didn't like the idea so they hardforked to &lt;can't write the name here because it's against the rules, but you know what coin I'm talking about&gt;.
Now, the first step of Segwit2X is activation of Segwit (we're here) and then, a few months later, hardfork to 2 MB and abadon the 1 MB chain. **We are going to have Segwit because of the agreement.** Some people recently seem to be against the 2X part, however "bad Chinese miners" aren't those who want to split the chain. **People who want to suddenly abadon the 2X part of NYA agreement are those who want to divide us.**
And just FYI, 2 MB block requires 0.0267 Mbps connection and 102.6 GB storage increase per year. My shitty phone has 128 GB internal storage.

Proof of Stake make the rich richer.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:40:31
NYA signers activated it by BIP141, yes.
And if you really meant UASF, then you should realize that they were irrelevant since they had no hash power.

Could you explain how to verify?
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:51:38


Why do you think that over 100,000 nodes we have right now is not enough?!
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:49:31


No, it's pointless. There are enough full nodes to make the network safe.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:43:52
No one says there should be no block size limit. The question is how large should that limit be. Where is the point that "full nodes can't handle"? If you really believe it's 1 MB, do the math.
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:04:20


[Here you go.](
@_date: 2017-09-06 08:30:09
We need to ask ourselves: How much decentralisation is enough? If the answer is "as much as possible" then yeah, 10 kB block would be even better. Until you realize that people won't want to run a node for a currency that almost no one can use (unless one pays unreasonably high fee).

I guess it's easier for exchanges to use 3rd party solution and don't give a fuck rather storing the money themselves.

Also Trezor is much more durable than KeepKey.

The only android wallet supporting Trezor (sending transactions, not just checking your balance) is Mycelium. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Calm the fuck down.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:25:21
That's the correct answer. The title suggest that's because of segwit (otherwise what's the point of doing such thread?) but segwit isn't activated yet.
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:22:24
So basically those who signal SW instead of BIG91 don't want to hard fork to 2MB in the future?
