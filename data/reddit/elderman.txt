I was going to say it’s worth a gazelle by the end of the year, but that price sheet isn’t available.  
So I think you could buy two zebras right now.  1 BTC = 2 ZEBRA

Do you not..?

...nine pence?

I had MBRO Mufflers and they were great for a jeep.   Enjoy!  
Also, did you pay with BTC, or did you pay for these with profits from selling BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:07:18
You’re right, we need a better way to sort through the memes

If I lose the hardware, will the seed still be able to get me into my account with the funds? Or can the seed work on any other trezor too?
Understood on the paper wallet generators being secure, Ive read various crazy numbers on how probably it is for someone to guess your private key. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:05:12
Where can I find the data for this / look at it in real time?
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:23:29
I'm optimistic but for a different reason - BTC is like electronic gold.  It should be more like gold.
At first, gold was valuable because it was pretty - we could make jewelry out of it and it wasn't where everyone could get to it.  Then it was valuable when used as a currency...now it can be used in science/etc.  Note gold can be broken into small amounts, but it isn't easy to transfer.
BTC is valuable because there is a finite amount, it takes effort to mine (not everyone can pick it up off of the ground), blockchain technology as security, and finally, we are using it as currency.  The reason it could go higher is it'll be able to break out into smaller sections.

So with a paper wallet, when you spend some of the coins stored on the wallet, where does the change go and why..?  
Edit: Why should I buy two of the same hardware wallets?
Good idea on reading the manual.  I will add these links to the original..
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:22:51
Tru fax, this is why I come here to learn! 
My question isn't exactly what I'm trying to understand, looking to think through what changes when everyone is on a level playing field and the currencies are the same.  
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:00:55
Why hold when you can sell now and buy later, but cheaper?
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:13:19
I did the same thing.  Sold all but one, however I bought in January so not as great as a run as 2010.  I think the market will continue to correct, I don't want to be completely out.  Might not continue to hold, though.   Do you have a thought for the next cryptocurrency?  I believe the idea still has a ton of revolutionary potential, but not if it's too expensive to do business.

In some of his talks it even says this at the end.  Like out loud in plain words - an advertisement

It seems your turbo is on L.  Will you switch it to four at 10:30 ET? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:08:07
I’d also like to know.  Tried this the other day and struck out
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:33:16
Let him run the gauntlet.  It’s fun for us.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:36:49
Is this math or a gut feeling?  Do you think it'd drop lower than 9k? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:48:34
People selling off at $7500 USD.  The severity of this dip might tell us something about the dip after the fork...
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:18:33
Depends, for me 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:35:22
Bad thing about shorts is you can only make as much money between the number and zero.  If you HODL it could be infinite...  
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:39:33
Do you think it’ll be less risky with wider adoption? What about less volatile? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:08:17
This is a great idea
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:30:27
Death, taxes.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:51:32
I too would like to know. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:31:19
I DO watch the price hourly when I plan on buying - some times it’s steady but other times it goes down a few hundred dollars and you can buy just a little more BTC.  If you end up getting even .1 more BTC that could be a lot one day.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:42:24
At this point you could add a zero to each and it’d be more relevant 
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:26:52
Why not just use one cryptocurrency instead...?
Like bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:13:14
I think you are both correct.  Your point about buying BTC and then using it as a currency is spot on...this is a currency we’re talking about, which people trade for other currency.   I could switch my USD for EUR, and increase my purchasing power if the currencies fluctuate correctly.   However, nobody takes EUR in the states and I don’t see the fluctuations I can capitalize on like BTC.  
It is still reckless to drop everything into a brand new thing.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:24:14
You can buy weed with FIAT now 
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:59:16
It does, and if I had sold in December and bought back in in February I’d have a lot more coins than I do today.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:23:49
I read the article and just thought...
..get out of my head 
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:45:10
Any tips to help me see the moving parts? 
And yes also true.  Cold storage for the win 
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:01:56
Definitely - taxes are not to be ignored, and depending on your situation a long term capital gain is much better than short term (in the US, I do not know the rules in other countries.)
Some profit &gt; no profit.  Refer to my post above, but had we sold at the ATH instead of HODL no matter what, we’d be sitting on double the coins.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:13:04
ATH = higher than before.   You will not go broke taking profits.  
Say you get in at 5 and out at 10.  You doubled your money.  Then you get in at 12 and out at 24.  You doubled it again!  That’s pretty good.  It’s not 5x, but it’s also not making you broke. 
Not FUD - just challenging he HODL strategy. I think one must have an exit strategy 
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:47:17
I agree.  But that also does not answer my question
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:17:09
Yeah, I tried not to be too specific because I’ve been in a frys and they have too much shelf space.  I started in a super high turn environment so I’m spoiled :p
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:00:14
Or, if you didn’t sell at 19, and it goes down to 9, you will be crying.  If you sell at 19, and you get back in at 25, and it goes up to 30, you’ll still be okay.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:02:29
Which banks still allow you to purchase crypto with credit cards? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:20:51
Don’t HODL forever - sell at the ATH, sit on cash, get out your chips and wait for the dip
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:00:26
I’d consider that, a lot more moving parts than mashing go on coinbase though.  
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:59:21
Yeah I’ve had one card forever but treat it like debit.  Gives me 1% back.  I’m in a position where I could use some leverage for this - firmly believe we’ll see higher prices later in the year and I’d like to get interest free loans.  Free money
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:05:00
The WSJ has “The Daily Shot” - an email that comes out every day with a lot of graphs and short storyboard.  
I’d like to see that, and maybe see a daily trend assessment as opposed to hourly what will happen.  Hourly sounds like it’d be too hard to get accurate enough.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:26:53
Nope.  Market will go up by 3-4 trillion at its ATH in 2018. Mark my words. Here is the first time you heard it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:20:06
So let’s say I buy 10k Worth on credit, and I’m liable to pay in the next year.  And I have 20k in crypto already invested (using funds im okay losing, grown from small)
My risk is I’ll have to pay off the 10k in a year, which I can cover with my current holdings (and the likelihood of my current holdings going down 50% from today is very low).  Not to mention, the likelihood of the space being larger in a year than it is today is pretty good, so I should be able to cash out and have more than I spent.  
In this situation, I’m essentially borrowing on margin using the CC as a vessel to raise capital.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:59:37
Brian? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:03:01
That’s an eff ton of shelf space, and dollars you could be selling.  
Unless..are your stores too big or your turns too low? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:45:12
Any reason you're not into ETH now?  Or you already are?
I got mad when I didn't buy MROE ETH at $35.  Should have bought bitcoin when I first learned about it at $200.  
I got smarter and bought at ATH's.  Which are wayyyy under where they are right now.   
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:43:20
RemindMe! 4 years 
people will be kicking themselves again for selling at $3000 when they could have sold for $300000.
