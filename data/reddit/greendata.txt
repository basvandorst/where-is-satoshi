I never claimed mere use of bitcoins is an endorsement of anarchist thought but I agree with you. The same can be said of USD or EUR. I may use EUR but that doesn't mean I support the EU or agree with it's fundamental goal of a central currency for Europe. I may even speculate in EUR but disagree with it's central purpose.
However, if I use EUR and praise the centralized nature of the currency and system, if I marvel at it's centralized creation and the power it brings to a select few, if I call "good" the way it engages in usury against entire nations and throws entire generations into debt slavery b/c of a few corrupt officials who will take a bribe, if I belong to then one would be forgiven for thinking I support the ideas behind the creation of EUR.

At this point I almost can't feel sorry when this happens. I would assume there is a 100% chance your funds will be frozen if you attempt to raise money through Paypal in this manner. Allowing donations through Paypal for something like ProtonMail is dumb.

If you ignore the anarchist foundation of bitcoin you're missing the point. Bitcoin was created to decentralize control of currency and to conduct transactions without the need of a third party.

This is completely fair and actually a good service. The person doing this is taking a lot of risk. If you can do better, let's see it.

Just simple theft at this point. I expect more cash seizures to occur as interest rates go negative and people take their cash out of banks.

It stands to reason that he would feign incompetence.

That's like comparing paypal to cash or paypal to gold. Many of those "customers" would not have ordered without paypal since paypal will usually solve any disputes in the customer's favor.
Paypal is not the enemy. The Fed, banking regulations, and the Government are the enemy of bitcoin. Let the free market sort it out.

It's not a scam if to sell over the "market rate". The "market rate" is different on localbitcoins versus mtgox. They are charging a premium for convenience. Now if they are not delivering the coins, that's fraud

This is so true. They subsidize the schools to hell with student loan programs, and the price goes up, so if you want to get an education you almost have to become and indentured servant. I know those of us who went to college deserved what we got but it's kind of hard to understand the whole system at 17, especially when society tells you to better yourself and get a degree. Now I don't trust society.
