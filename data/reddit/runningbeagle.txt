Different coins for different uses. Store of value vs. small transactions. ETH has the smart contract layer, which makes it especially attractive for use as a currency and secondary applications.

A digital currency.

There will be high-transaction fee coins for store of value like BTC. 
There will be low-transaction fee coins for every day use. The rate of profligation of alt-coins will be exponential. Alt-coins will never face the scaling issues of BTC.

Never ceases to amaze me that people believe this.

Any proof or way of verifying this?

There are situations where the past is a good representation of what to expect in the future, and there are situations where it isn't.
Regime change after the 2008 housing crisis make applying pre-'08 modeling assumptions useless in today's mortgage market. Stricter lending standards and increased regulation make today's market fundamentally different from that of the past.
The question is whether bitcoin, or crypto in general, has experienced such an event. For one thing, BTC has experienced exponential adoption compared to the Mt. Gox era, during which there was basically one source to acquire BTC without mining it. Therefore, I don't believe it's reasonable to include the price history prior to 2014, during which returns and volatility were orders of magnitude higher.
However, if the trend since 2014 is any indication of what the market is capable of, then it wouldn't seem unreasonable to experience massive returns based on persisting volatility and risk neutral asset drift.

Couldn't the sender of small deposits consolidate UTXO for you by sending to the same/unique deposit address?

If my math is right, $2 = 17,062 satoshi. Divided by 80 satoshi/byte = 190 byte transaction.
Isn't a non-Segwit transaction approximately 250 bytes? If paying the same price you paid, that would be $2.63.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:43:44
Is this a large amount because of the number of transactions? Think of how many BCH and BTG he has to consolidate... 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:16:56
Transaction fees dipped because of the holidays. What makes you think that will continue.
Mass adoption will only increase demand for space on the blockchain.

Increasing by powers of 10 several times was impressive. However, it shows more where BTC has come than where it can go today. It can't increase at that rate into perpetuity. 
Compare BTC and crypto market capitalizations to other non-income producing assets used as a store of value. Gold is approximately $6 trillion USD, so depending on BTC dominance, 20x in today's USD could be a reasonable fair value estimate.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:37:02
At what point will 1BTC be considered dust? Seems the minimal amount of BTC worth transacting on-chain will increase exponentially over time.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:51:19
Thanks. BTC is a relatively known commodity in this new asset class. Will be interesting to see how funds rotate in and out of the alts in the going forward.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:06:12
Would be more meaningful if the contract required physical delivery.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:22
I'll allow it.

How do I claim BitcoinGold from Blockchain.info?
I imported my mnemonic seed to Coinomi and set up a BitcoinGold wallet using the M/44H/0H/0H derivation path. This allowed me to access BTG from one address, but not in the other address I have at Blockchain.info. Is there another derivation path I can try? I've already tried M/44H/0H/1H, etc.
I see the BTG is at the address via

Analogous to the USO oil ETF. The ETF continuously rolls forward the futures. Given the oil futures contango, investors experience negative roll yield.
It will be interesting to see this ETF's roll return given the futures have traded at both a premium and discount to the spot market.

The futures are settled based on the Gemini bitcoin index. To the extent the Gemini index reflects the true price of bitcoin, the futures price will converge to the spot price at expiration.

What's wrong with an online wallet like blockchain.info?

They say they're still going through service disruptions related to identity verification, so it could also be that.

How does GDAX credit your account with Bitcoin that was acquired in odd lot trades? If I place a market order for 1BTC and get filled at several smaller layers of quoted liquidity, does GDAX credit my account with each limit order (i.e., get a new public address for each trade execution that made up a fraction of my 1BTC order)?
Or do they consolidate it somehow, and I receive one public address for my 1BTC order? Seems like there would be transaction fee issues as it's not uncommon to see people trading in 0.001BTC lots.

ETH actually has a use case outside of being a store of value. Long-term, that seems like a better play than BTC.
In the short run, it seems ETH and LTC are getting pumped because they're the cheapest things offered on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:52:06
I heard Ripple is to be offered on Coinbase next year, hence the rally.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:11:18
The fact that futures are quoted in a fiat currency is irrelevant. The trading that occurs on exchanges in the spot market is also in fiat, unless you're trading cross crypto currency pairs.

Once your identity is verified you can move substantially more than that. The verification process is backlogged at the moment.

I was in BTC before the forks, so still own BCH and BTG. That's my diversification haha.
The only thing keeping me out of Ripple is I know nothing about it.

I've noticed the GDAX verification requires photo ID, whereas Coinbase has several levels of verification, some of which do not require photo ID.
You may be at a lower level of verification on Coinbase that doesn't meet GDAX's standard.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:21:42
That's an interesting thought. This is still at least a decade away. And by then bitcoin will only be worth anything to the extent it hasn't been hacked or replaced by a more secure crypto-currency.
