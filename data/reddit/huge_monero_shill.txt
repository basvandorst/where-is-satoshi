MLM with Bitcoin. Same old scams, new tech. Story of life.

Not a lump sum investment. The scenario is dollar cost averaging (DCA) since the top at some interval (weekly/monthly) still comes out positive. 
No one is saying going all in at 20k comes out ahead today. Reading comprehension dude.

This is good for Bitcoin.

Living off T bond interest was a good strategy for a different world. Interest rates are effectively zero right now.
The rule of thumb with a diversified portfolio is that you can live of 4% of it a year forever basic on historical trends. That number assumes you spend exactly the same in good or bad years, so its safer than real life (you could skip the 3rd vacay during a 2008 like event).  
$200,000 pre-tax income is pretttttty good fuck you money.

People overestimate the change that will happen in 2 years, and underestimate the change that will happen in 5. A decade is forever in tech!

I think you too are in agreement. You should keep working, but that work could be developing hobby skills. Its just a very different type of work.

I feel the same. My job is fine,but it would be nice to have the freedom to decide "you know what, I want 2 months off. See you next year!" I want more freedom to pick and choose my responsibilities, not a complete lack of responsibility.
