I'm pretty sure they don't publish anything without proper prior research. At least, I hope so, coming from the agency that defines many of the cryptographic standards everyone uses.
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:00:48
Quite simple, really. No fully decentralized payment routing algorithm has been developed to date.
The Lightning Network white paper dedicates a single, brief section to payment routing where it states the following (section 8.4 "Payment Routing"):


To this date, every known architecture for a payment routing system includes a network backbone, or a subset of nodes through which most of the traffic is routed - much like the internet works today.
The decentralization properties for this design are strictly worse than those for the existing Bitcoin network. This is because the competitive and pseudo-anonymous nature of Bitcoin mining severely hinders the incentive for cooperation between competing miners, whereas central LN nodes have no deterrence for cooperation.
Edit: Also, there's the legal aspect. It is a no-brainer that LN nodes are amenable to being categorized as money services, in which case they would fall under strict regulations. For Bitcoin nodes, this would be a lot harder to argue.

Actually, she was pretty specific. She said that the point this post is making is inconsequential given that it rests upon the premise that people are gonna randomly start opening channels altruistically. It sounds like a quite reasonable thing to put into question.

Did he not suggest a 300kb block limit and ask that people not use SegWit until Lighting Network is operational?
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:03:23
Yeah like lately every post around here is about the Bitcoin fork that cannot be named. It's getting tiring. When is someone gonna post how I can use the Lightning Network? I'm not a programmer and have no clue how to start using it without some magic ninja coder moves.

Please, stop making sense. You putting into question the decentralization properties of LN is offensive.

I'm not sure she does mean that, but if she does, then it's a pretty silly statement. SegWit is opt-in.

There can be multiple special-purpose side-chains with different benefits and trade-offs. Anonymity, smart contracts, IoT.

I have low-level technical knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol, bidirectional payment channels, and payment routing. I also understand the legal implications of routing payments as opposed to mining Bitcoin blocks.
Are you sure that *you* understand LN?

Yes. Well informed, eloquent, capable of critical thinking. No way to be sure, but you're probably right.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:51:52
So you need to freeze the total amount of funds you want to use upfront.
You need to choose between giving access to your full economic activity to a single, random node in the network, or else splitting it up between 100 nodes but paying 2 on-chain transactions per channel (open &amp; close txs).
Why on earth would anyone want to use this?

You sound like a very reasonable person. If there were more people like you around here, this would be a much more civil place.
However, I think breaking the rules is morally permissible when the rules are oppressive and are made to benefit a small group of people at the expense of all others. I will continue to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:07:42
I think it's a valid concern. I don't think that "leave your money at Coinbase" is a valid, long-term solution. A 1-2 multisig wallet solution with a trusted third party would be a great compromise, but the fees won't allow that now since multisig transactions are significantly larger.

So Bob needs to prefund his channel with the coffee shop for both himself and Alice?
Blocking two-months worth of coffee every month at the beginning of the month? Who would want a chunk of their funds frozen for each shop they use, paying full Bitcoin fees for each channel opening?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:57:15
You cannot make "tens of thousands of off-chain transactions" over a payment channel like the video claims.
The number of transactions is capped when opening the channel by the number of blocks before the automatic refund. So there is a trade off: the more off-chain transactions you allow, the longer you will need to wait for the automatic refund if the other person stops participating in the channel.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:16:50

@_date: 2018-02-13 19:51:23
I'm not saying your conclusion is wrong, but your points are mostly misleading, inaccurate, or flat out wrong.
1. Is wrong because Segwit does not render Bitmain Antminers obsolete. Most Bitcoin (BTC) mining today takes place on Bitmain machines.
2. Is both false and misleading because BCH development takes place at Bitcoin Unlimited's [Github]( and Bitcoin ABC's [Phabricator]( Both are very active and have several commits over the last week.
3. Is plain wrong. BCH is already up to 32mb compatible; no hard-fork is needed. Miners simply need to change a configuration parameter when running their clients.
4. Is misleading because every coin based on Nakamoto Consensus, including Bitcoin, is technically open to a 51% attack. Moreover, today Litecoin is more vulnerable to a 51% attack than BCH.
5. Is debatable and mostly opinion-based.
