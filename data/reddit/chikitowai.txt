She is extremely talented! Good luck with her business.

True, just got me a little excited. Being able to order computer parts online via Bitcoins would be awesome.

So paper wallets are a no-no?
@_date: 2013-06-06 14:07:51
Thanks for the answer, sorry if I offended you with my stupidity.

It isn't, you don't download anything and I always have my anti-virus up.

I don't think Bitcoin requires someone to be too smart in the economic perspective to understand Bitcoin. Essentially its a crypto-currency that provides anonymity to the payer and payee with a fluctuating price.

Wow, thank you so much! My first bitcoin tip :)

The false accusation of anti-Semitism in this post is too damn high!
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:59:45
No problem!
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:46:43
Thanks. I think I will try a small portion at bitfinex.
@_date: 2013-06-06 14:08:07
Viva LA Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:09:12
Seriously? 'LeWeb"?
@_date: 2013-09-12 17:04:31
Ohhh I see, thanks a lot for the explanation!
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:56:45
What about faucets that give out 1 ubtc?
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:59:31
You and your opinions. Sorry it doesn't appeal to you.
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:51:58
My bad I edited it out. Fixed the link.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:01:25
Just the uncertainty of the acceptance is what got me to post this, sorry.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:08:10
Must be this, goob job.
@_date: 2013-06-06 13:57:04
I meant noob, sorry.
@_date: 2013-06-06 14:22:41
I meant noob, and why are you stealing that guys deserving karma?
@_date: 2013-09-12 16:00:36
Any way for this to get hacked just from the public address?
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:57:10
Sorry. I fixed the link, but at least check out the website from somewhere else than. They really need the publicity.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:24:51
Was just excited is all, I did mention that he either knows something or knows completely nothing.
