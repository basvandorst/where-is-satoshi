People just don't seem to understand that no matter what PoW you introduce, there will always be centralization pressure. 
The people willing to risk investment in mining will reap the rewards. The people that run their operations where electricity is cheap will be the most profitable and able to expand more quickly.
When bitcoin rises in price a hundred or thousand-fold a lot of this pressure will start to go away, because the cheap electricity will be all bought up. It's gonna hurt the low-income families in such areas because they will see their electric prices equalize with the rest of the world.
I moved thousands of miles for the opportunity to pay ten times less per kWh. 
If you truly want to help decentralize mining, do the same.

Mining is not homogeneous. Many miners are paying upwards of 6 cents per kWh, some even upwards of 10 cents per kWh. Others have access to electricity prices as low as 1.6 cents per kWh. 
There are also miners who continue to mine at a loss because they've become addicted to it or hope to make it up with a future BTC price rise.
Under no circumstances will 100% of miners shut off their equipment. This is pure FUD to try and push dangerous code into a hard-fork.

Everyone can act as a hub, and you can open a payment channel with anyone willing. Your payments will play a bit of "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" to find the cheap efficient route to the seller.
It's essentially the way the original Ripple worked (minus the debt-based network) before it was taken over and converted to the centralized monstrosity of today.

I'll confidently state what I please. Saving Visa level transactions across thousands of nodes worldwide in perpetuity would be idiotic. 
Guess what... you can pretty much do Lightning today manually. 
There is no reason a single payment channel couldn't handle Visa level TPS. See how much more efficient things become when only the interested participants have to save their transaction data?
Now imagine how many TPS a whole network of payment channels can achieve. 
Welcome to Lightning Network, the future bitcoin-secured backbone of instantaneous worldwide micro-auctions for every gram of matter, joule of energy, or second of service you pay for.
@_date: 2016-03-08 23:23:07
Meanwhile, Lightning network would be able to handle it no problem. The blocks can stay small, the financially participating parties can do thousands upon thousands of TPS between them, and they'd only use up a few on blockchain settlement transactions every once in a while.

The 'ideals of mining' were, and always have been: Those willing to take the risk and invest the most money have the chance to earn their share of the pie from their investments. 
That's the way it was designed to work. Greedy actors acting in their own best interests to form a distributed consensus network.

Next time set your fee to 0 and when it doesn't confirm, complain about how Bitcoin has been perverted from Satoshi's original idealistic socialist vision of a currency which anyone could mine for free, forever, on a computer from 1990. 
Make sure to throw in how worthless a decentralized, deflationary store of value is if you cant send 1/1,000,000th of a cent around the world for *free* and have that transaction stored on thousands of computers around the world.

Saying that miners in China are colluding with fabs. That Chinese are the kings of backroom deals. Something to the effect of American miners could be puppets of the Chinese (as if that were a worse situation than the other way around).
The whole thing came off as very "Us vs. Them" as if all Chinese people were a monolithic entity controlling the network.

It will be included in the core client and wallets will update to use it. The process will be essentially the same as using bitcoin now, except you get instant confirmations, micro(possibly nano)-transaction capabilities &amp; the bitcoin network becomes able to process a metric shitload more transactions due to the efficiency gains. Lightning transactions *are* bitcoin transactions, just handled in a more efficient and intelligent way. Leveraging the security of the bitcoin network to allow you to interact in a trustless &amp; instant fashion.

The halving it vital. It shakes up the mining landscape and allows nimble operators to jump in and help decentralize the network further.
There is a reason you see people like Marshall Long supporting this. His operations have grown large and slow to adapt. 
This does nothing but support centralization by allowing the largest operators to vote themselves security of profits &amp; peace of mind.

Just because you want something doesn't mean you get to force others to compromise on your technically unsound requests. 
There are ways to craft an 8mb block so that it takes more than 10 minutes to verify. That is a systemic risk we can't just unleash because a bunch of nearly illiterate crybabies want it and "WANT IT NOW!!!!"

People wanting to profit off it is what makes the network as secure as it is. If there wasn't financial incentive to expand mining operations, anyone with a few bucks and an axe to grind can come 51% your hippie commune currency.

A proof-of-work blockchain does not work without an economic incentive. Some people think the innovative part of blockchain technology is having a distributed database. It's not. We have had those for ages. Every large website uses a distributed database of some type on the backend.
The key breakthrough by Satoshi was figuring out a way for disparate parties acting in their own best interests to come together and create consensus as a side-effect of their greed. That would not happen unless the token was worth something to the miners.
If the token has no value the security aspect never kicks in and you have a useless distributed database that anyone can attack. You'd basically have wikipedia on thousands of nodes, never sure what the 'truth' was because anyone could change the blockchain (database) at will. 
Bootstrapping a currency is difficult, and I do think focusing on the lowest level of manufacturing would be a worthy project. Once base materials can be priced directly in BTC, the products built on top of them can begin to price directly in BTC and the whole currency network can trickle out to consumers from there.
We need to get miners (literal, break apart rock for elements, miners), food producers, &amp; energy providers on board with direct pricing in bitcoin. Once that happens the USD exchange price can be severed from the importance people currently place on it.
If I had been smart enough to hold on to more of my early coins, I would be a farmer pricing direct in BTC right now. As it stands, that won't be possible until we see another bubble, so I can push through the initial capital outlay to create a self-sustaining business.
TL;DR: Decentralized blockchains don't work unless the token they use has value.

There are almost always incentives for certain levels of centralization in just about everything we examine. The questions to be asking is "What does it take to become a hub?", "Is becoming a hub permissionless?"
You see, being a miner is permissionless, and you can become one for a few hundred dollars. The centralization pressures are external factors such as electricity prices, cooling capacity, taxes.
I'm not sure we need disincentives for LN hub creation. Hub &amp; spoke network models tend to be a more efficient network topology over completely distributed mesh networks, and mesh networks tend to revert to hub &amp; spoke once some type of link pruning is applied for efficiency.
As long as becoming a hub is permissionless &amp; the cost is not onerous I think we'll be ok. 
The main concern over hubs was that blockstream would be running LN like the modern version of Ripple where they controlled all the central hubs and would have censorship capability, or make the network subject to the whims of various nation-states.
From my understanding, every client will have the capacity to become a hub. The main limiting factors being bandwidth and the amount of bitcoin the user is willing to tie up in payment channels.
That means there will likely be less centralization pressure in LN than there is in mining.
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:08:14
I'm expecting similar. Looking at the last halving we stayed in a narrow price band for 5-6 months after the halving and then quickly went to ~26x the halving price. I think we'll see the price being  pushed down by saved btc for a while after, until the supply shock hits. It doesn't take much change in supply to drastically change a market once it is in an equilibrium state. 
I like the idea of halving the supply instead of gradually decreasing the block reward with each block. It shakes up the mining industry and offers opportunities for new risk takers to step in and help decentralize and optimize their processes.
@_date: 2016-02-22 10:21:52
Satoshi expected mining farms to come along. There are economies of scale and locations with 1/10th the average electric costs.
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:12:16
I hope so. Transaction fees need to cover the costs of enough mining to keep the network secure against even the largest of potential attackers. The amount of LN transactions that would be occurring to fill blocks just from channel opens &amp; closes would mean bitcoin had gone mainstream to some extent and the higher transaction fees will help ensure network security of an increasingly valuable target.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:03:42
The transactions do need to be stored by every fully validating node. The checkpoints are a kludge to work around this, but it's a type of centralization that most core devs want to move away from. IIRC the pruning covered in the whitepaper was for SPV nodes. Storage is ridiculously cheap and may be getting cheaper on a per node basis, but you need to take into account the thousands of times replication across all full nodes on the network. Then also take into account those nodes storing each transaction *forever*.
Expecting the same % returns from a deflationary currency that you see in fiat is a mistake IMHO. I too would like to see security issues Re: LN hubs addressed, as the fees will need to be higher if your btc is constantly at risk from the next heartbleed style exploit. 
I think we'll see LN fees bidded down nearly as low as they can go. You're talking about a marketplace where every network participant has the chance to let funds that may have just sat in a 'lukewarm' wallet earn a pittance instead. 
It will likely all play out in ways neither of us have foreseen, but I find it quite exciting to watch the security of bitcoin leveraged into a much more capable payment network for everyday transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:31:15
This is basically a different incarnation of multisig. One in which you don't need to bring out your second sig unless an unauthorized transaction occurs.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:39:07
Because an on chain transaction has real 'hard' costs associated with it that may not currently be reflected in the fees charged. A 5 cent fee to send an on chain transaction to thousands of nodes which will process &amp; store that data in perpetuity likely doesn't reflect the actual costs across the network. By opening that payment channel, you become a link and potential hub for many other transactions, possibly making the LN more efficient if there were other people having to make 10+ hops as well. 
Opportunity costs are frequently trotted out as an argument of last resort, as if to say "But if only I had chosen the correct numbers, I would have won the lottery!" If a good investment comes along, close the payment channel and use your funds. You may have processed hundreds of LN transactions in that short time and helped make many classes of transactions much more efficient, all while keeping on-chain fees high enough to secure the network, and LN fees low enough to support true micro-transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:28:09
It would be obvious it wasn't a normal transaction. Wallets would still need to be coded to handle these. You simply don't provide your service until the time limit is up and the transaction confirms.
A normal user of this isn't likely to spend directly from the vault due to the inherent delays involved. They would top up a hot wallet that they spend from.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:00:45
They won't need to be significant. The storage and processing of each transaction on LN isn't shared by thousands of nodes worldwide. You'll have hub competition from nearly everyone on the network driving the fee price down to miniscule levels, and if the fees are too much for you, you can just open a payment channel directly.
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:30:31
I'm fine with Bitcoin being the settlement layer since we'll have Lightning Network to be the instantaneous, micro-transaction capable, better than the original alternative.
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:23:43
They don't get 'spent' for the predetermined set of time, allowing you to change the spend using the recovery key until that time is up. Kinda like a time-based RBF.

TL;DW: "We ain't gonna tell you who Satoshi is."
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:45:03
Once those transactions offload onto LN the fee pressure will reduce. Each channel can process thousands of transactions without needing further on-chain transactions.

Last halving won't be too relevant as ASICs were coming online allowing massive hashing improvements over the FPGAs. We don't have that now. Improvements in ASICs will be slower and incremental.
