U wanna know what u should do ? If u r already holding bitcoin and can't buy more, just chill. Spend time with ur family, don't look at the rate every 2 min and think long-term. And long term doesn't mean 1 year, it means atleast 3 to 5 years. You are gonna be ok.

A 1000th post on the same topic. This subreddit is getting ridiculous.

6k "support"

Easier said than done !!
I have tried it multiple times and failed miserably. Seemed a pretty straight forward decision hitting that sell/buy button. It's not actually.

If u have spare fiat to invest for long time, put ur buy orders with a spread and wait for them to fill.
And then continue living ur life.
That's the best u could do.

Like the internet, this subreddit has been infiltrated by scammers now-a-days. If you know what i mean !!

Such deep thought provoking discussion by "redditor for a day". Lol.
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:46:46
Sincere Advice.. Don't FOMO buy now.. Wait for better prices than your sell price.. and don't listen to anyone who says that this may be the last time you see these prices.. Your patience will be rewarded.. 
Good Luck..

Don't forget that you grew on the shoulders of these same "old, confused and ignorant people". 
Be respectful. Even if they are wrong.

And your reason is ?
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:46:55
Agreed. I'm astonished to see how NEO is holding steadily at $ 39-40 Mark while all other coins are bloody red. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:24:17
I would recommend to do your research before buying any coin. Buy it ONLY if u like the idea of it and you can see long term gains with it. There are numerous coins btw. You can check into OMG and ICN as well. STRAT is also not a bad investment. 
But to diversify your portfolio I would suggest the following coins 
BTC (ofc), ETH,NEO, IOTA, OMG and throw in some ICN if you can.
Forgot LTC :)

WTF did I just read???
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:25:55
They are suckers. Held my verification for 4 weeks without replying to any tickets or emails and one fine morning they just rejected my verification because my Id was apparently not in the right format. Never went back to that site. Plus the rate is quite high there, to be honest.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:11:03
LTC and ETH are good bets too. But you asked for the most promising one right now. IOTA is the most promising one in my opinion as it uses the revolutionary tangle tech and ofc it's at a steal of a price :) I would stay away from doge.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:48:35
No doubt. IOTA.

If I have to absolutely use my credit card I use coinmama. I don't know there might be better possibilities like coinbase or gdax but I have never used them coz they don't entertain customers from my region. My only choice is coinmama or local bitcoins. Check and compare both coinmama and cex.io. 
@_date: 2019-09-04 05:48:02
Well. I have been in your shoes and after loosing a handsome stack, ultimately decided that I'm not a trader. So, now I just buy once it's red. And don't really care about supports and resistances bcoz you maybe right 99% of the time and you won't profit that much, but the loss of that 1% wrong will leave u gutted. Hope u learn from this experience. Look at the upside. By not worrying about S/R, your quality of life will improve significantly. Also, don't feel down, just put the buy orders at your break even and get your btc back. You never know, your orders might hit in the same month. Good Luck out there.
@_date: 2019-09-11 08:15:01
Bought everything I could utilizing these cheap prices. Deleting reddit now. See you people after the halving. Good luck out there.

It was a ledger bug acknowledged by ledger. Hopefully it has been resolved by now. Happened to alot of people.
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:00:48
Hahaha. Yeah I've been. It's 60% of my total portfolio. Alt coins included.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:38:04
Bitfinex claims to distribute BCC among settled bitcoin wallet balances (including BTC Lenders). Do you think it would be a good idea to keep btc at Bitfinex? According to their new announcement, they reassure that "your bitcoin is safe and this event will not effect your bitcoin balances-you will simply be receiving an additional token balance".

My brother, you are not Alone.
Hang in there.

Although no one knows the future but I dont agree at all with ur statement. Bitcoin is the future undoubtedly. It's the grandpa of crypto and it's gonna stay there leading the way. It's a storm we are facing these days and it's gonna pass. No point in panicking. Bitcoin is gonna get through this. Once it does, there is no way for bitcoin but UP. And once it goes up, the alt coins are gonna follow. P.S. It's not the first time for bitcoin to undergo a fork. So just chill.
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:41:45
There are people who have lost and are losing much much more  (percentage wise) than You. I'm a holder and my portfolio is down by 60 %. Just dont panic. If you can't afford to lose this money, you still have time to sell and get out of it (coz your loss percentage is low right now). But I would recommend that just sit back and relax. Leave your portfolio for a couple of months. Things will be fine.

I wish we get this much amount of time for accumulation because I can only put $100 a month maximum, maybe less. My target is 1 btc. I'm at 0.1 ��
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:21:34
Nothing bad is gonna happen on August 1st, let alone anything worse. Bitcoin is going nowhere but UP. Just wait and see.
