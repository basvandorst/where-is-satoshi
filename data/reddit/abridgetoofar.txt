without escrow it's hard knowing if your dealer is going to try to fuck you on the price (to his advantage).  I'd stick to escrow-only sellers and you should be fine.

All the way to 500 million!  that'll pay off the 1.1 trillion in US debt China owns.*

both mt.gox and bitstamp require residency documents that are rather difficult to obtain in vietnam, especially given my living situation.  Am I SOL until i get myself my name on one of these documents?

Relative to the bottom axis, marking the price.  The bottom corresponds to the latest sales, the top to what happened before (given the scope of the graph).  The left axis applies to the yellow bar, which shows the amount of bitcoins needed to be sold before the price (bottom axis) is reached, the left shows the amount of USD needed to be put into bitcoins before the price increases (again, bottom axis).

Had this trouble when I lived in Montreal, I say if you really want to buy in bite the $50 upcharge and go with localbitcoin.  Much easier than figuring out bank information that could take weeks.

I guess it depends.  If this is a bubble, it'll pop eventually.  If this is re-adjustment for demand that's skyrocketed in the last month or so...I'm not so sure.  Ultimately if you believe in it I don't see why you wouldn't be willing to accept a short term loss (if it is a bubble) for a long-term position.

I used them once before.  Everything worked well.  This is a big gain for bitcoin acceptance.

People are buying into the freedom it affords.  But incentives now based on readjustment (or bubblenomics) play into hoarding.  It won't always be like this.

Living in Vietnam, I see its possible use every day.  I've been here just a few months, but it was enough to convince me to buy at 600 when i was hesitant a year ago in canada at 50
