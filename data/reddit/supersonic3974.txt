Exactly. Once it happens a few times you get used to it and simply use it as a teaching tool. There's no way to predict the future to realize when to sell. But for Bitcoin my strategy is to just hodl.

No, not really. It's only a 5% drop from $7,600. In the traditional world that's big, but it's nothing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:13:51
That doesn't make sense. People would want to get in before the fork.

@_date: 2017-11-29 21:13:03
It will lock in the price when you place the order

I saw the price, but didn't realize until I got to that we were at a new ATH.

The way GBTC is structured they can't purchase more BTC. Yes it would be different with an ETF.

Yeah, it was "premined" but there was an initial crowdsale to distribute IOTA back in November 2015 ([link](
But yeah, it's totally fee-less and really fast. I think it will be huge once it matures some and adoption increases.
Here's some to try it out!

It became way overvalued when bitcoin first broke $5k. It shot up to over $1k per share. It's currently at $700 with Bitcoin at $6k, so it's still a bit overvalued, but not nearly as much.

All going long means is that you are holding the security in question and therefore will make money if the price goes up. So yes, going long without leverage is the same thing as buying with cash. Long/short just denote which side of the trade you're on. So you can go long with or without margin, but to short you're required to use margin. Also note that trading on margin and trading with leverage are two separate things. For example you can use leverage without using margin (like trading a 3x ETF).
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:28:23
What I'm saying is that if you're not leveraged or on margin, you can't get wiped out (unless the price drops to 0). I've been long for years now through all kinds of rises and drops and I'm doing just fine. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:28:47
Long don't get wiped out if they're not on margin.

I actually disagree. The bitcoin infrastructure and architecture is constantly being improved and expanded. You're betting on a system that is growing up and adapting. It is not as scarce as it's ever been and ever will be, in fact it will become more scarce over time as demand increases, the mining reward decreases and more coins get lost to the void.
