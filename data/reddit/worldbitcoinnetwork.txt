No. That's actually the cornerstone to the idea. It's much like folks on LinkedIn posting their resumes or Andreas giving a list of his upcoming talks. It shows that you are a verified citizen and you have a certain track record, VERY handy when it comes to citizens under brutal dictatorships or rebel uprisings. No financial data is readable from a photo. Its just a photo. And everyone is getting photographed all the time these days (by stores, surveillance cameras, governments, themselves, their friends, at parties, you name it) So what's the big whoop?

Okay. Dat's cool. And on your end just realize, its so hard to interpret typed words. I get SO SO SO many people coming at me, literally one rabid fool a day, that sometimes I respond too quickly, but man its like a hailstorm. And I fully believe in the tragedy of Godwin's Law. So I do try and take all my important conversations offline. Reddit does not have a history of improving human understanding.

Your analysis works if all the actors are rational in a world of perfect information, which is short for saying your analysis isn't worth much. You need to factor in political pressures (real need for chinese to push capital out of their country) cabals (the folks making the chips cutting insider deals with one or two of their mining pals), ignorance (i've got a hunch many miners imagine a world where they have monopolized mining and believe that they are now providing good service for bitcoin...ugh), political pressures and regulatory frameworks of the host country, and economy of scale (which i've spoken about endlessly). If you ignore all these factors, well then your analysis might just hold water.

No you are not missing something. Scaling vs decentralization is such a huge problem that most bitcoin insiders steer clear because it doesn't appear to have any software or hardware solutions. Frankly it's terrifying to see the scaling topic reframed in the way Andreas does.

Well what I'm suggesting is that its more than just finance at stake here. Its everything. And the only root cause that explains everything (including Gilens flatline) is congress voting openly. Even as a single issue, Gilens is very hard to explain by 'nixon shock'.

We do have the controlled experiment. Policy today reflects 100% the interest of the wealthy. Before no. We have the evidence in all the convictions, admissions, motivations etc. We even have the addition of secret voting during the gilded age which helped bring that under check. Never has the data and the solution lined up so cleanly.

Thanks to both of you for the great stuff.
@_date: 2014-07-12 15:47:44
Ugh. And I would love to say no. But there is a chance we will need some of these things. But yes, like we talk about in the video, signing up the masses in a way that is acceptable, even it me (and I'm not as afraid of centralization as others), seems very very difficult indeed. Clearly if you have any ideas on this send them along. I'm all ears. Thanks!

No arguments here. But I am talking about a practical solution, that can be done today that would eliminate a lot of control that wealthy have over our lives.

Thanks for noticing this. This is something that I have thought a lot about as well and I do think it is an important conclusion.
@_date: 2014-11-04 15:41:09
Well lets think about that. The 1970 bill that I talk about, makes Congress venal and susceptible to bribery a full year before your 'shock'. And while you claim Nixon took the country off gold, we know he doesn't have the power to do that without Congress. So, my bill not only precedes your 'shock' but it also appears likely that my bill caused the 'Nixon Shock'. And while going off of the gold standard is terrible and scary, it still doesn't explain all the other events as cleanly as vote buying does. What do you think?
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:56:25
Thanks!!!! Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:21:16
Surprisingly all my research suggested that congressmen would welcome this with open arms. Sitting inside the fishbowl ain't easy, and that's what they do 24/7 as congressmen. They really are left with no ability to think and make their own choices. They have to fundraise and apologize. They're ready for a change...and some rest.
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:15:50
all i found about Bittip was their github. Any sources you have for simply explaining what they are up to would help. With opentxs what did you see as the killer app in particular. It covers so much, that its not always even clear how to simply define them in a quick slide or two.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:52:43
Hope you weren't there when the moderator had to stop me at one conference because one speaker and I ended up in a heated discussion. Not good. Though, the speaker and I shared a few beers &amp; laughs later. 
Andreas BTW has a lot on his shoulders...and no one has given me more insights than him. I've also never seen anyone talk on as many subjects so well without one note in front of him. Great stuff. What few people realize is that Bitcoin as a subject matter has grown too big for any one person to know it all. Its reaching the depth, already, of much older sciences. There is so much innovation. Bitcoin reaches into so many fields (finance, econ, tech, crypto, hardware, sociology, politics), that it really requires that either you know everything or you will make a couple mis-steps here and there. I can't imagine anyone will fill Andreas' shoes any time soon. Go Andreas.

Perhaps you missed the section where we address this specifically in our video 27 minutes and 22 seconds it starts. We actually say what you say in your quote above and then we address this major difficulty. Most of our supporters feel that this is one of the major strengths of our proposal.

You must know that I was kicking myself when the video grew to over an hour long. But yes, I needed to put it all out there in one piece (all the evidence and all the history). Perhaps in the next couple months, myself or someone else will present it in a shorter way. 
But that said, let me address your great questions. 
As for other countries...we will find evidence (more on that later). But what's crazy is that we have real evidence in the US that addresses precisely the question you make at the end of your comment. The data I present is late in the video but research has shown that the secret ballot was one of the principal reforms that cleaned up the excesses of the first Gilded age. Amazing stuff. 
Further, keep in mind that my research was released yesterday. For the most part, the same mistake is being made everywhere (Brazil, Russia, Europe, etc). What I am claiming is that the studies never showed this because they never looked for it. But man, the second half of the video a summary of the endless and ultra-compelling evidence. Please check it out. And thanks for watching what you have so far.

Well actually lots of folks have shown and suggested that congress is broken. Nothing new there. Its just that now we have the data. But the data isn't mine. What I am suggesting is that I have both the cause (bill from October 26 1970) and the solution (a cardboard box).

OP's ridiculous parroting of Kashmir Hill's completely BS article is the only real problem here. Ronald continues to use Bitcoin. Is liquidity high in Uganda. No. Does he have daily problems. Yes. Does he still transact in Bitcoin. Yes. Almost daily. Kashmir didn't get this because Ronald's english is not good, and he clearly didn't understand her, and she didn't understand him. She did a crappy crappy job with that article and it is a shame to see her work rekindled here by people with nothing better to do but repeat lame and five minute press. Why didn't she interview me, like the film guys. I'm the one sending Bitcoin to Ronald? I'll tell you why. LAZY. She's done good work in the past, but on this piece she deserves to be shoveled into the same bin as Newsweek and their piece on Satoshi Nakamoto.

Exactly a model is just to help someone juggle all the assumptions. But assumptions are just that...guesswork based on limited data. So garbage in does equal garbage out. And models often fail. But that doesn't mean they don't have their place. Great tools to developing understanding, and should be used at least as much as the charts that everyone looks at every day.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:05:27
Stream unlikely. It's a somewhat informal event as HBS is just now embracing blockchain tech. I'm presenting some old stuff as well as the beginnings of a new talk tentatively titled "A Million Killer Apps" which attempts to foresee all the places where Bitcoin could disrupt or completely take over (and there are many), but I will definitely try to put out a video of this talk on my youtube channel in the next month.

@_date: 2014-11-04 15:36:45
I agree with your last line but only in theory (and in my heart). In reality (the terrifying data of Gilens paper) we see that this is not happening at all. If there was even a tiny amount of angle to Gilens flatline we'd know that congressmen were responding to this transparency and listening to the people. De facto, not happening. Therefore we need to assume that the people have no power to coerce their elected representatives. And the flip-side is also true - money not only coerces representatives, it buys policy.
EDIT - made the last sentence cleaner.

I come from a died-in-the-wool tradition of liberal-left, so it was a surprise to me to see this in the data. But it is true, the libertarians have been 100% correct. Because of Gilens work, we now have powerful evidence that all we lefties have been doing for years is wanking.

"Glass ceiling" is actually a pretty good description of the last few weeks since I posted my vid. Difficult to get attention in certain circles. But it's not the first time I've struggled with 'intelligentsia', both from the inside and the outside, and man they're cruel even to each other. Lots of pulling out the ladder and stepping on fingers. Gotta keep battling, though. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:21:58
THanks so much, glad your watching. As per the FOX bit,  unfortunately while the actual shoot was long and interesting, and we covered tipping and so much more, the edit was decidely anti-bitcoin and really just candy. But that's the way these things go. I've actually reached out the the BU professor who is Mr. Dark Cloud in the spot. I'm hoping we can chat and meet.
But to answer your question...I added a tip in a way similar to credit cards, by writing it on the receipt. But all that stuff (adding a tip, donating, etc) will be available soon. Square, btw, is great. But Bitcoin is so young. Watch it grow and grow. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:59:44
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:37:06
The trouble is your proposed solution is a bit like trying to control viruses. This is because it is so hard to define what a contribution actually is. And there’s lots of discussion online and in journals to support this.
What’s wild is that its hard to distinguish between a donation, bribery and just plain regular business. 
For example:
If I give money to a company in Guam, does that benefit you (I’m assuming you don’t live in Guam)? Well the trouble is here is that we don’t know if it benefits you, even if we do lots of research. It could benefit your fifth cousin, and that is what you were hoping for. It could benefit you in that the company competes directly with your enemy. So hard to tease this out.
Another example:
If I hire you after you leave congressional office, is that a kickback or were you merely the best person for the job.
Well again we don’t know.
So trying to stop financing is like trying to stop rain. Shutting down open voting in congress is as easy as walking across an empty street.
What do you think? Okham's razor grab you?
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:54:08
Sadly, I have to agree. Our spot was the lone bright spot in the piece and they chopped most of the interview. It is FOX however, so in some respects that's a pretty good piece for such a conservative network.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:09:19
Great. And this is in many ways the systems I was studying when I stumbled on this 1970s bill. Check out Chaum's work on voting. Very cool.
@_date: 2014-12-01 04:52:49
I'm a huge fan of transparency. And I'm a big fan of using blockchain tech inside government to provide transparency and eliminate corruption. In fact the topic is something I am actually actively working on developing with some folks at MIT (looking at funding etc). 
That said, transparency has only a couple places where more transparency is actually a bad thing. Voting is one of them. Secret Ballots trump transparency every time. But that's not to say all aspects of voting should be kept hidden. Instead, I also really admire David Chaum's work on how to provide better vote counts through cryptography. And I'd love for all vote counting to be made as transparent as possible.

Sadly that's not a language at all. Its called pseudocode because its just meant to look like a computer language and give the idea of how a protocol might work. Probably should have just written it in Python, but I didn't want to have to think too hard about it.

So cool to see all the positive response. BitcoinFilm rocked it (again, after Ronah and I told them our story, Jacob and gang FLEW to Uganda to film Ronald's part of the story). Editing it just in time for the conference. Great shots. Great production. Wow. And I agree with OP, it would be nice to see their work get a more play on some bigger media outlets.

i wish they covered that in the video, we spoke all about it. really a mix of random chance and just blabbing his mouth near FOREX offices. One place a guy walked out and said, you got bitcoin, i'll buy all you got. You can imagine what its like to be in Uganda if you want to buy bitcoin, its not easy easier. So the first guy was jumping all over Ronald. Very funny. We did a few transactions, then the excited guy disappeared, so it was slow for a few weeks. Its catch as catch can.

@_date: 2014-11-04 16:38:34
Well yeah, and as the video grew to over an hour, it hit the floor of the editing room. I was looking heavily into David Chaum's proposed solutions using Double Blinded Signatures. I found most of that stuff ultra-compelling. And combined with a ballot box could really change the game. But that aspect is for another video perhaps in the next couple of months. Thanks for asking.

Thanks. And yes, Europe is important as a case study, which is something I am looking into. I spent the better part of the last ten years in Italy. But all I can say is, it kicked my ass to get all the data I got for the US, and finding data on italy is a million times more difficult. So, my guess is with time, especially now that I've released my results we'll see other contributions to this work. Perhaps even someone who understands Europe better than me will chime in.

Yes. 100% provable in Congress. They can vote as Aristotle did, with two urns and two different colored balls. Then at the end of the vote they turn over the urns and count. You can leave the cameras rolling the whole time and no one would be able to tell how any individual voted, but you would still have a fraudless vote. Marbles aren't easily hacked.

remember shares don't have to correspond to a fixed amount of carbon. It can float based on numbers of users. We can add new people and hence lower the value of each share.

No argument. I'm not suggesting any solution brings us to utopia. 
Also, I agree 100% that monetary control by atoms is much more reliable (gold) that what we've been left with. But don't forget that I didn't suggest this all started in 1970. There were many public votes by congress before. The 1970 bill just multiplied it by a factor of 10-50. This means however that before 1970, one could still bribe congressmen on some bills and find measurable results via voting records, it was just much harder to do.

A) that photo is not verified. B) whatever country you are writing from has done its fair share of evil shit. C) the word 'usually', I would say is likely not based on anything but fear mongering for a reddit post. I live in Uganda often. I have never met a warmer, friendlier country. Do they have hangups about gays, yes. But if you do any minimal research you can find major articles (new york times, etc) pointing the finger straight back to the USA and funding for miseducation. Please stop spreading bullshit.
@_date: 2014-07-12 15:41:19
Wow. Great comments super insightful. And there’s no question you really get the idea. So thanks for digging in. Likewise, it took my slow mind a few days to digest the contents of your powerful write-up, but I feel I’m ready to respond.
Firstly, and most importantly, I agree, if we can build as system that relies entirely on market and social forces we can win. Any centralized auditing, oversight or control leads to failure and lack of trust, efficiency and transparency. Not good.
Your concept of auditing is actually something I have thought a lot about, and like a lot - a whole lot. We think it would be imperative with our system to have such a system in the form of a forum. And this forum would provide a public discussion (a back and forth) on how many shares companies are actually purchasing and what other users think they should be purchasing. While these numbers may never align exactly, we are lucky in the sense that carbon is actually very countable, even on an individual basis, so we do stand a chance of success here, in particular because third parties can enter into play here. Companies who measure carbon could do the auditing and provide their stamp of approval. Then as these companies build trust, they might provide technical expertise to these decisions. 
Again, because counting carbon is possible we stand a chance. I would hate to try and count trust or human rights abuses etc. Very difficult things to quantify and essentially why our system does not apply to every tragedy of the commons.
Finally one query. To me the term “pre-mined” has bad connotations. And what it really implies is that some users have far greater shares than others, especially because they were an early adopter. So in regular financial terms it is akin to insider trading or market manipulation or even monopoly. While (as you note) giving each person an equal share is a very very difficult challenge, the key difference here is that their ownership is for life. All shares will be lease only. So no one entity can manipulate the market or run a 51% attack or monopoly. So yes, our system is akin to pre-mining, but without all the bad stuff. And, though you make no reference to it, it should be clear that we do not intend to make an alt-coin of our own. We will have no coins in the system. Just contracts (so yes, perhaps premined contracts, if you will, but without all the premined downside crap).
Please write back for any reason (especially if my poor writing still leaves you with questions, or if you don’t like something I wrote)

No. Its a smaller point actually. Its just about Gilens data. His data suggests that Libertarians were right to bitch and scream about government. Everything that libertarians have been feeling since the 70s is confirmed by his work. I am not saying that Libertarians have considered cardboard boxes or were worried about the Legislative Reorganization act of the 70s.
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:35:33
nope. you missed the point. the spot price (i.e. today's price) is just another model. much simpler, but works in your favor 50% of the time. all it means is the spot price has less risk then many models. I wouldn't use that to predict tomorrows price either.

I wrote this to the OP and he deleted the whole thread. Thought I'd make sure others read it as well.
OP's ridiculous parroting of Kashmir Hill's completely BS article is the only real problem here. Ronald continues to use Bitcoin. Is liquidity high in Uganda. No. Does he have daily problems. Yes. Does he still transact in Bitcoin. Yes. Almost daily. Kashmir didn't get this because Ronald's english is not good, and he clearly didn't understand her, and she didn't understand him. She did a crappy crappy job with that article and it is a shame to see her work rekindled here by people with nothing better to do but repeat lame and five minute press. Why didn't she interview me, like the film guys. I'm the one sending Bitcoin to Ronald? I'll tell you why. LAZY. She's done good work in the past, but on this piece she deserves to be shoveled into the same bin as Newsweek and their piece on Satoshi Nakamoto.

That's not their job to respond to lame press. The filmmakers flew to uganda, spent over a week there, they came out and interviewed me. They spent weeks sending us follow up questions. They had us review the video before it was released. They understand Bitcoin really well. They did the right thing.

An unknown bill in 1970 opened the floodgates for corruption and massive campaign finance. I believe I'm the first person to ever reference this and these implications. As a scientist, I have never seen the data ([Gilens 2014]( align so cleanly with the results and the solution (a cardboard box).

Actually it's like saying you can see the future because you can predict a coin flip 50% of the time. What its really showing is that about 30% of all bills get passed, and so average citizens don't budge that.

@_date: 2014-11-05 01:15:02
education, like everything else started to tumble AFTER this 1970 bill, and it appears because of it. So yes, education is a problem, but it is not likely the causation. And while you are in the UK remember that these patterns (open voting) are basically a universal trend, all of which were made more open in the same era.

No arguments here. I think leaving the gold standard created big problems that even Seneca would acknowledge. But I don't think leaving the gold standard describes everything as cleanly as the change in voting (incarceration, bankruptcy laws, you name it). Further I think the change in voting is likely the reason we left the gold standard (as in my concept is the cause for Vibr8gKiwi's lion fish). Thanks!

Hmmm. I like carbon fee and dividend. But is it easier to administer? Its not clear that cap-and-trade (which I love) or your idea (which again, I like) will ever pass through our lovely government, and like all other cap-and-trades and your idea, there is a requirement for government approval. That is the big problem. And unfortunately means that your CCLs proposal is very very very very hard to administer, set up or provide. That is the essential problem. That is what I am trying to fix.

Clearly you're not willing to do any of your research but just parrot the lazy article done by a foolish reporter. Had she done any of her homework she would know that Ronald still deals actively with Bitcoin, almost daily. Is supporting his education with bitcoin related activities. She could have also reached out to me and Ronald's sister, we both speak English a Gajillion times better than Ronald does, because clearly that article was based on poor translation and misunderstanding.

Well actually I'm screaming louder than you think. It is my belief, and the data seems to suggest it, that this one tiny bill from the 1970s set off all of the massive explosion wrt to all the events you are talking about (all problematic before 1970 but shot up like rockets thereafter - the corporate culture, modern CEO, inequality, globalization, decline of unions...blah blah....). My view is that without an open congress you don't have the change in bankruptcy laws at all. And you have a much more responsive and much much less partisan form of politics. Did you see my chart at 51 minutes in. Its my favorite. Partisanship shoots up like a rocket the day the bill passes.

I wrote this on the YouTube video, but def worth a repeat here. Those guys (Jacob &amp; gang) did an AMAZING job. I've lived in Uganda and feel is really there. They didn't even hype up the story (Ronald transferred his first bitcoins in under an hour from when he opened his laptop! And he got a great rate to the local Ugandan currency.) But it should be mentioned that they flew to Uganda, stayed there for a week to get this story as well as bringing a crew to meet Ronah, Enrico (my son) and I in San Francisco when we were on vacation there. Huge. Great win for Bitcoin.

It's a good point. But I'm not as pessimistic about this as the OP on YouTube, and I will be doing a video on this concept as well.

But it's not clear that it will all be insurmountable or bad.

Did you see my talk? For someone to suggest that LN or SegWit are going to fix the main problem of mining centralization is just hopeful guesswork. And even if they were both working perfectly tomorrow, they would not reverse the problem one iota. Indeed, they don't solve anything outside of 1. kicking the can down the road a couple months and 2. making it cheaper for current large scale miners to centralize.
Finally, Satoshi's the one who mentioned voting first. In his white paper. When he defined proof of work. If voting doesn't imply democracy, I don't know what does. So blame him, not me. Trouble is, he was bright, but no polymath. He didn't understand one thing about the complexities of economies of scale or voting.
We either build a Conner Consensus (congress of miners) or we have something that is 1000 times worse than paypal. BTW all the same logic applies to Ethereum too.

Its a good point. But I think that it's fairly easy to explain. Both Represent and myself use Gilens' data (the flatline) in the same way, which is to show that current Congress is completely indifferent to what the people want. In short, Gilens data is just a problem statement.
From there we build our solutions, which are entirely different.
To be honest, though, Represent.Us' solution isn't that clear to me. They look at finances and bribery-based corruption, which I'm not convinced is the correct way to tackle the problem (and I suggest in my other video that if they succeed it could make matters worse). I mention them by name in the other video as well. But no, I have not been in discussion with them.

Here's a new twist on this whole conversation and it involves a massive oversight by scholars. (And it addresses your post above because you are focused on 'contributors' and 'legal bribery')
What if the political influence of intimidation is much much greater than that of bribery? In other words, what if campaign finance and cash injections aren’t nearly as powerful as the ability organizations have to scare legislators?
Let me highlight by way of example:
You’ll likely remember the NRA’s excessively harsh response to Senator Joe Manchin after the Sandy Hook tragedy. Troubled by the deaths of so many children, Manchin decided to work on gun legislation. But, when he did, the NRA went after him with a force that nearly crushed him. The attack ads were extreme. 
But, importantly, the commercials didn’t just influence Manchin.
Just months later dozens of senators or representatives were suddenly terrified to vote against the NRA on even no-brainer type legislation. With one Machiavelli-style hanging, the NRA managed to scare dozens or hundreds of legislators. They achieved massive political influence without a single penny switching hands, indeed without bribing or supporting anyone.
Intimidation is like a shotgun. It is cheap, messy and indiscriminate. Bribery is not. A secret ballot would, of course, eliminate this intimidation completely. 
Yet, while fearless legislators would likely produce substantially different legislation, there’s an even more important corollary. Would the NRA be as likely to attack a congressperson if they knew that Congress might band together and lash back at the evil NRA? Unlikely. The NRA’s ability to count coup (see the votes of individual congressmen) makes attack ads much more powerful, and Congress’ transparency neuters their defense.
Okay, this is fairly obvious right? We’ve all seen this intimidation stuff.
Well before we dismiss this as a minor realization, we have to look at how completely this concept has been left out of the high level policy discussions. In Zephyr Teachout’s 2014 book “Corruption in America”, she mentions the term ‘bribe’ or ‘bribery’ well over 200 times, while references to ‘intimidation’ appear on only two pages (both in the second half of the book). Lawrence Lessig’s “Republic Lost” is another enormously important book on the subject of congressional reform, and he makes 46 references to the word bribe and zero references to intimidation. That’s right he doesn’t address it at all. These are some of the most influential books on the subject. But it doesn’t end there. Similar percentages are seen in nearly every book that aims to fix Congress.
This is an egregious oversight, with powerful implications. I’d suggest that the influential attack ads have increased over the last few decades exponentially, and that these types of attacks are a form of voter intimidation. And they are just one of many ways congressmen have been intimidated since the passing of the 1970 LRA.
Secret ballots would scare wannabe bullies back into being nice. And man, that would change everything.

You want me to engage you...well, wake up. I already have...All my ideas are published. Hours of them. Interviews. Videos. Etc. Yours aren't. And if you have studied my work, I clearly think you are wrong. Does that make me right? No. It just means that I haven't seen a single thing that makes sense to me that confirms your POV. Sorry. 
You should know that I stomped on your dumb ass to see if you would produce evidence for your argument. You haven't. That wasn't to demean you, because I don't know you. You could still produce something legit. And if you post a well thought out video so I can see 1. who you are (i don't battle or engage random anonymous troll-like angry goofballs) 2 understand your POV. And then, if its any good at all you'll get the engagement that you are so thirsty for.

No Kyle, the Constitution is the worst of all possible analogies. All amending of a Constitution takes place inside of government under formal procedures with massive checks and balances and very high bars. While not perfect, a very high level of democracy is assured. And once voted on, the decision is enforced by a number of procedures and checks that prevent a reversal from happening ten minutes later. 
On the other hand you have Bitcoin. And Bitcoin has no formal procedures, it works as an anarchy powered by an enormous special interest (miners). Indeed Bitcoin can't even call for a date for a vote, it's got no deadlines, its got no checks and balances, no formal procedures, and no vote is final (so reversal can happen ten seconds later), and no one even knows how to provide a clear framework for the discussion.
Sure we've got the concept that half of the miners have to agree and then a policy is adopted. But what the hell does that mean when it seems very possible that 80% of the mining these days are controlled by one person or one cabal. That's the antithesis of a democracy. That's oligarchy or worse. Its bullshit. 
So my comparing Bitcoin to the global community trying to fight climate change is a much better analogy. Why? Because the countries of the world are bound together by little more than special interests and anarchy. There are no enforceable obligations. Just prayers, rhetoric and bullshit promises all funneled through special interests and conniving government officials.
So, for Corey and yourself to pretend that infighting is going to lead us to the promised land instead of to hell is based on no evidence whatsoever. Further, it is dangerous for him to say that bullshit, because it hides real problems with Proof of Work and Bitcoin governance. But it does play off very well with the Reddit mob, and I'm sure you'll get lots of love for saying what the crowd (and Andreas) really just want to hear so they can feel good about themselves.
The best things about Bitcoin right now is that its teaching a bunch of idiot libertarians the benefits of the governments they have been hoping to burn down for so long. And I know, I was there with them four years ago. Because of all the bullshit in Bitcoin, I have become fascinated by the charm and allure of a beautiful democracy.

Secret voting in the legislature is a concept everyone has struggled with, including me and my current supporters. 
And to answer your question, I don't think a delay helps at all. For one, transparency of voting at any time opens the door just as wide for both bribery and intimidation (I can still burn your house a year after you vote against my company, I can still give you the nice job a year after you helped me win a contract). So unless you kept the secret for 50-100 years (long enough for congressmen to all die), I see no benefit of a delayed release.
Further, as long as congressmen know that someone is recording the votes (even to be released 100 years later), they know that somehow the recording system could be hacked and their votes revealed. So they won't be as confident about the secrecy.

No arguments here. As I hinted in earlier vids, my upcoming "Million Killer Apps 3" will focus entirely on the concepts you talk about.

Hi Ryan. James from idchains here (its not even a company, but hey)
No two ways about it. I've always been impressed by you, onename and your work. Go onename.
Perhaps the most important thing that needs to be said here, is that in some ways idchains and onename offer very different solutions to even considerably different problems. The field of "identity" needs to be separated and defined better. There is a huge difference between storing funds and signing messages with that of what the TSA might require when you land at a border check. I'm mostly concerned with the latter, and still have to polish my solutions for the former.
Anyway thanks for the great comments and super-insightful critiques. I'm not fully in agreement with all of what you said, but that's because I'm slacking. It is my responsibility to clarify my ideas in the next vid.
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:06:00

Thanks. When someone comments on the intimidation stuff I get a warm feeling. I feel that the observation is so simple, yet so completely left out of public discussion.
And yes there are tons of problems. Ballot access. Two party dominance. So many. I do think, however, that the proportional representation (as opposed to winner-takes-all voting) [that I talk about]( addresses both of these issues (indeed may even solve them) in profound ways.

I don't think so.
Now lets take this to the next level. I could also have you verify yourself from a known location in your city, someplace where I might even already have a camera. Could you fake that?
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:02:31
Its a good point and there is some truth to what you say. But remember the Senate isn't as simple as the pizza stuff. Bills are written. Legislation is passed. Power can often land in the hands of the few. 
So, given that, I would say multiplying the number of minority voices by 1600% would help big time. There are numerous votes in the Senate which swing on the difference of a handful of votes. So having 17 senators (in the case of hispanics) would give minority groups enormous bargaining power. Further new bills would be proposed. And the actual latinos and blacks that win would no longer have to pander to majorities. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:11:04
I'm not a big conspiracy guy. I actually think the bill was proposed and passed by folks who just never considered the implications. But that said, Kennedy was aware of this bill before he died, it had been pushed and bounced around for ten years before Nixon finally signed it.

Hmmm. I disagree. Zero confirmations is probably fine in an identity system. But as always the more the merrier. And yes, I was intending for one to set up the identity system in advance.
And yes, given the system I presented, there would be a security concern. But that's why I kept stressing that I was doing the simplest of all schemes, and in the next videos we'll incorporate merkle trees &amp; branches to solve this problem.

Both of your points are reasonable given the current context (and I'm guessing that you don't shop much using credit). As I suggested this is just an example to put the basics of the idea in place. As you'll see, identity is a much bigger thing than just resolving purchases at Target.
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:01:13

@_date: 2015-07-14 11:03:21
Well said. And I agree. What's cool about the example in the video is that there is no name involved. That's already a form of anonymous identity. I kept thinking about this thought that I could walk into Target, and the clerk would say "Hey there" and I'd say "Hey", "Do you agree to these purchases" and I'd say "yup" and walk out. They never even knew my name.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:35:52
Exactly, TPP used the bad kind of secrecy (allowing lobbyists and businesses to write legislation...UGH). 
But its also interesting to think of it the other way, and say that TPP used the bad kind of transparency (allowing lobbyists and businesses to sit in on the legislation...UGH).
Either way, the Founding Fathers were rolling in their graves on that one.
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:52:04
Are there any implications you can think of that are negative? Given that they shoot video of you in the store, it's hard to imagine.
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:47:35
While I agree with you 100%, I have two points to make. One: I was just using Target as an easy to swallow colorful example, you'll see better in the next vids where this is all going. 
But that said, your main premise isn't correct - probably 1/3 of the purchases at Target involve credit in some fashion. Credit requires some form of ID. 
As you well know, I don't need to give anyone an ID today at Target if I pay with cash (so Bitcoin isn't quite as novel in this area as you suggest).
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:00:05
Well said. I agree, and thanks. Though I would add, with idchains, one could add all the biometrics, DNA, private keys and passwords that one might want, and do it in a way that is a tad more secure and provably you than many current systems.

Thank you for framing it so well.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:39:03
Thanks again for your thoughtful and well considered response. Now my response:
Unlike bitcoin, trust is likely going to be part of any identity scheme that aims to compete with passports. Even DNA does not by itself establish birth location, birth date or whether you were in southern Sudan when the rebels were there. 
So thinking about trust as an integral part of identity is important.
In my example Target clearly needs to trust themselves (and their employees who do the initial setup) and other companies will also have to decide whether to build their own identity schemes or trust someone else's (i.e. Target's) verification.
That said, trust has its problems. So my view is we just want to be able to decentralize that trust as much as possible. 
This is where these idcams come in. They are strictly volunteer things. You can walk up to them, mark the time and date and now use that to establish that you were where you said you were.
That's why I could see dozens of NGOs, individuals and others putting up these location based idcams that I mention. This decentralizes everything to do with id. And this decentralization of id allows us to ask questions like, do we trust the id established by the NGO or the one the government issued? In some cases we'll see the NGO's one is the valid one. Governments and many passports issued are corrupt.
So, assuming you are dead on correct (or better still, even with the world's best CGI working in real time in HD) a face based identity scheme still works marvelously, because we can use it via idcams and actual in-person encounters (i've not seen any robots that mimic humans perfectly yet).
Would love to hear what you think...
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:46:01
While mass production of identities isn't that easy. One person creating a few different ids is possible. I call them doppelganger ids, and yes, with this system you can weed those out / prevent them. In short you could ask both parties to be on a skype video call at the same time. Not so easy to do if you are just one person.

I never suggested that all miners needed to be identified. I do think we should have some combination of PoW (anonymous) and identity mining. 50-50 perhaps.

@_date: 2015-11-15 00:16:17
Are you serious? This is pretty simple. The Chinese government can take control of those miners in seconds. So if they have 51% or more, then we are already under a centralized authority, the chinese government. Right now the government just plain doesn't care about bitcoin, but what about tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:12:47
I'm not saying either/or. I'm suggesting a combination thereof.
And are you suggesting that China doesn't know where those big mining farms are? I'm not sure they will have to do any "finding" whatsoever.

@_date: 2015-11-11 22:17:35
I do not recommend CPU mining. I don't recommend ASICS. I recommend identity mining. If you don't have that you WILL get centralization which means Bitcoin is worthless.
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:08:39
That's true IF the miners aren't already centralizing themselves. And that is happening. Again China now controls &gt;51% of the mining. Which means that the leadership of China could run a full 51% attack tomorrow. So you are being irrational. Decentralization and anonymity are incompatible. You either have on or the other, and lets sure hope you chose decentralization because without it you don't have Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:30:36
In 2010 mining was decentralized. Now more than 50% of the mining hardware is under the thumb of the Chinese government.
@_date: 2015-11-14 15:01:57
"seems" scares me.
But even more scary is that more mining farms does not mean more decentralized. If they are all owned by one person then it is centralized.
Worse it is suggested that &gt;50% of the mining power is now in China, which makes the Chinese government a centralized actor in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:45:20
Don't be foolish. Are you trying to suggest that all 7,000 bitcoin nodes are controlled by 7,000 different people, and you can establish that? Stop.
@_date: 2015-11-14 15:54:04
Let's be honest, there's no way in hell either of could say where the mining is (strictly because almost all of it is under the radar!)...but if it is under the control of China...well we got something much worse and more scary than MasterCard
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:18:06

That's a good question. And that's information I had never heard before. I promise to ponder your question further. But just hearing it from you (albeit anonymously) it makes me feel better.
Note, however, I never suggested that miners reveal their identity. I see the protective value of having a decent percentage of miners anonymous. I simply suggested that we provide for a large number of identity based miners. This has three important benefits (provably decentralized, better bitcoin governance and near infinite scaling). And hopefully you feel the "wow" when you read these three major benefits, because they are all big deals.
Questions for you. 
Do you think mining is centralizing? Do you see it centralizing further? Do you think centralization could be a problem? Are you "known well"?

Commodification of asics doesn't change the game at all. It would be just as easy to centralize cheap hardware as it would be expensive. And asics aren't the only part of the equation. All aspects of mining have centralization incentives. None of them have decentralizing incentives. And as a result we get what we currently have...massive mining centralization.

The House of Representatives is an interesting example. It may be the most provably decentralized institution on earth. But I hear you...your question is valid and needs consideration.

Decentralization is **impossible** to measure or establish when the system is based on anonymity. Technically we might not even be able to use the word at all.
@_date: 2015-11-12 04:00:41
You asked three questions. I'll respond.
1. I guess in the same way the US elects members of Congress. Sounds horrible/impossible/stupid/old-school I know. But it might be the only way.
2. Well, that's interesting. I don't know. Rolling with your idea, I would sleep better if our current miners volunteered their identities so that we could count them and place them geographically.
3. We want numbers of people. Because individuals can be corrupted we can't rely on individuals. That's precisely why we decentralize. In fact that is the only reason we strive for decentralization. The more people involved the harder they are to capture and corrupt.

No it doesn't and there is no data or evidence that you can show that supports that, and there is no measurement available to suggest that it might be working when implemented. You are lying to yourself based on zero evidence.

And here I thought it might have come from the latest Bitcoin book on centralization...
@_date: 2015-11-12 14:05:18
Actually I do address that point in the video. And it is a problem. But we are juggling parameters and a minimum of identity appears to be a requirement. So is that "ridiculous" or necessary. I'd argue the latter.
Also, what would you prefer the "right to anonymity" or Bitcoin? You might not be able to have it both ways.
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:11:16
Bitcoin as we know it is not sustainable in its current form.
EDIT: Gotta love being downvoted for a big idea without a single critique on the matter. That smells distinctly like denial.
@_date: 2015-11-15 02:20:03
Censorship resistance is the ONLY thing protecting the fixed supply. Before censorship resistance was made possible no one even dreamed of being able to set a fixed supply of anything.
Further, censorship resistance is the ONLY thing protecting your transactions. It is the ONLY thing that allows for any of the blockchain 2.0 ideas we have seen. 
And censorship resistance is made possible by decentralization. Trouble is decentralization lately needs to be put in quotes. Bitcoin looks less decentralized every day. And boy does PoW look less compelling every day. [Something needs to change.](
@_date: 2015-11-14 15:05:06
That would be a step in the right direction. I would feel better about it. But lets not forget that a feedback loop is important. If the public "votes" on them, they will have some responsibility to the public. Right now they don't. And from what I understand centralization is happening big time.
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:26:20
This does not affect fungibility at all.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:44:27
Yeah right. That is the world's worst definition of decentralized. That's just relying on guesswork. I could be the one buying all the asics and setting them up in hundreds of different spots with different IPs.

I'll agree that bandwidth is an issue. But rejecting the storage problem is a tad provincial. Storage is a big issue. It has been discussed by core devs and was a concern for Satoshi himself. 
Take for example, cell phone users with SPVs ([see image]( which in my opinion are a real danger because of the ease with which they can be Sybil attacked. Imagine now, that every cell phone could easily store the entire block chain. Well that's a game changer. It improves security, it provides better network security, and brings a cell phone closer to being a full node. Way cool. 
As you know the percent of of users who maintain the full block chain has decreased over time, dramatically. This is not because bandwidth is an issue. This is because storage is a problem. Incredibly cheap, vast, portable storage would enormously benefit Bitcoin.
I'd welcome your feedback,
@_date: 2015-11-15 14:44:17


What?!?!!?! How!?!?!? Do you have any evidence to suggest that you stand even 1% chance of being correct here? It's not an issue in your book because you clearly have NO idea what you are talking about.


Again you are guessing and you are wrong. China is a strong government with no bill of rights which makes them especially powerful and likely to do takeovers. Despite what you think about the US, the US gov is nowhere near as powerful and centralized as China. So if China doesn't scare you just look at what they did to prepare for the Olympics. Their removal of houses, villages and even parts of cities by fiat was jaw dropping. No individual rights mattered.

Unfortunately the problems with Bitcoin scaling are almost entirely unrelated with that of Moore's Law. They have much more to do with the [problems of economies of scale and centralization]( are traditionally old and unsolved problems.

Sweet article as usual Erik.
Here's my two cents. I don't lose a second of sleep over this whole goofy discussion. Someone calls it "blockchain", fine with me, I know it means Bitcoin. They will eventually. It's all a positive. They are coming to the Bitcoin discussion in a way that works for them, around the backside.
And here is a goofy metaphor, but think of HP and the printer business. HP makes tons off of the printer business. But anyone who really knows what they are doing knows they make next to nothing off of the printers and they make buttloads off of the ink. Should HP start calling it the "printer ink" business. Well, really, who cares as long as the folks are buying.
I'll take the front page of The Economist any day. Sweet.

I agree with you. And I suspect that communism cannot work, but for sake of argument, let's think for a second... Was communism ever tried in a vacuum? Was it really given a fair chance? No. At all turns, the west was trying to subterfuge and thwart the efforts of communist regimes. There were embargoes, sanctions, CIA insurgents, paid coups, etc. Billions of dollars were invested to break down communist infrastructure. If communism in the 20th century was a scientific trial, we'd have to agree there was serious 'tampering with the evidence.' So to look at implementation and make broad and general conclusions...well...that's just not good data.
@_date: 2015-11-24 17:38:28

The beauty of an axioms/theories is that they are fragile. All you need to do to prove them wrong is find a single tiny fact or counter example. They only become more valid with time when no one appears to find the counter examples.

@_date: 2015-03-01 16:41:11
I agree with your first three lines. Indeed, there is data to support what you said. But as per your fourth line...Well...as implemented democracies mostly do suck. But just because a car doesn't run, or it's spewing smoke, doesn't mean that we can extrapolate and say "cars suck, they never work." Frankly, I think the same can be said for most discarded ideas. Communism didn't work, but does that mean it can't? That's not so clear. I'd like to think we're more analytical than this.

Same guy. Two different arguments. Not so subtle differences. 
Of note: I don't like the reality that identity is required to decentralize. It's just a reality.
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:53:40
A permissioned ledger is a LONG way away from 400-1000 independently elected miners mining half the blocks and then standard Proof of Work mining the other half. And yes permissioned ledgers are foolishly inept at censorship resistance.
So NO that is not what I am proposing. Please ponder harder.
Further, Acton's law doesn't apply to 1000 people all competing to be the celebrity miners who get to win the block rewards for just being cool. In Acton's world there is no feedback loop. In my world there are infinite feedback loops.

Basic economics? No you are wrong. Basic economics says that in all economies of scale (like asics) you will have centralization.
As a note, CPU mining and various mining using variable hashing algorithms were only an interesting aside at the end of the video. It was just a funny/yet interesting idea. The main idea of the video is quite different entirely.
I am suggesting that the ONLY way to assure decentralization is to actually identify a portion of the miners. We need to know who they are.
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:37:28
I actually see this whole argument quite differently. I believe we will see an explosion of low value, low worth contracts, which will self resolve, and really no one will notice or even really care. Say wifi usage as we move about town. This isn't currently the stuff we see settled by contracts because they are so petty. But because they are so petty we don't want to bother doing them. So yes, given that each individual will enter into, possibly, thousands of contracts a month, the vast majority will be smart contracts and require no lawyers. 
But I agree with you, the threshold of nuance for traditionaly stuff will be low.
@_date: 2015-03-11 14:31:35
Well...not really...but sort of. A little later in the video I present [this image that I photoshopped together]( which is the metaphor I was thinking of.

Just did a video on it. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:56:49
First, a warehouse does not prove decentralization. One person could control 100 warehouses in 100 different countries all with different names and IPs. So no, a warehouse is NO measure. 
Curve or L shape...I'm not so sure. Not sure I really care either way. As long as you agree that anonymity is incompatible with decentralization we are good.
I actually made no proposals yet. In the video I said I was tossing out a hypothetical just to get people's ideas flowing. The Andreas mining every tenth block is clearly a foolish idea for technical reasons...However, I'm hoping you understood where I was going with the concept.
Finally your last paragraph is just hopeful guesswork. There is no historical data of something that is profitable that decentralizes. No incentive structure will work. You know that. Bitcoin is proving that. Stop believing your own BS.

Given the way scaling has been contextualized, I hear you. 
But I think the way the Scaling Bitcoin folks are tackling the problem, they are asking all the wrong questions, and attempting to put bandaids on severed limbs. Identity mining allows for near infinite scaling.

The entire point of decentralization is that no one person is credible enough. Therefore we don't let any "one" person handle the problem. By counting noses, increasing the number of people, we decentralize, therefore we don't need to trust any single (corruptible) individuals.

Yes. You'd likely have to pay the transaction fee for every single one of those 948 transactions. Still, right now, many miners will pass transactions onto the blockchain for free, so you might be able to do it without cost. If you paid the current transactions fees, well that could be as high as 20-30 cents per transaction.

I can't argue with that. BUT... Switzerland is such a rare case in so many things, that its hard to extrapolate from their experiences. They are often brought up with respect to having zero resources and I think this is important. There are strong links between low resources and better democracies. It certainly allows them to be non-militaristic because who would want to invade them and take their resources...they have nothing. This in turn creates a situation where democracy can thrive because the only way for the government to raise money is through the people themselves, but if the people are paying then they will demand accountability and involvement. So yes, Switzerland is cool. But...

Again, I agree with you. And suspect you are right. But, still, I would love to be able to run a couple control experiments in laboratories with no tampering.

You're correct. And the increased transparency terrifies me. But the tradeoffs here are important. And I do believe that we should continue with at least 50% of the mining as proof of work.
Again, here are the important points which appear to negate what you wrote.
Bitcoin needs to be provably decentralized. If we are just crossing our fingers that it is decentralized (like we currently do), then we are just playing around and waiting for Bitcoin to be shot down.
There is no hardware/software solution that provides something that is decentralized. No algorithm for a mining pool works. No amount of nodes or cheap asics or collection of private keys and cryptography work. They all fail when it comes to proving decentralization. Indeed, we all have a growing suspicion that mining is being centralized...and fast.

If you can't establish, measure, demonstrate or prove Bitcoin's decentralization then PLEASE stop calling it "decentralized."  Just call it what it is, wishful thinking. 
All evidence suggests that Bitcoin is steadily centralizing. Massively centralizing. And these days when it appears that China might control over 50 percent of the mining what are you trying to create? Sucker coin? I'm a scientist and right now I would say that Bitcoin is starting to compare unfavorably with MasterCard.

Its a good thought. And I see where you're going here. But...It is a rare vote buy indeed when money is transferred right on the day of the vote. Usually the time lags can go up to years (job offers after one leaves congress, campaign finance, etc.), so delaying the publication days or months won't offer much change at all. Worse, if I  invest in a horse-shoe factory in Wyoming is that vote buying. Well it could be, perhaps the 8th cousin of a congressman benefitted off of that transaction. So buying a vote is very hard to link to actual money, we just mostly see the bribery in statistical analysis. So really the best thing is to close down the vote (never publish who voted for who) and then work hard to elect representatives who actually represent us. This is how it worked in the 1960s and amazingly it worked really well. It was a decade of great legislation and diminishing partisanship, corruption and inequality.

But each day that passes the 2nd million apps video grows and increases in complexity so much, that I really should do two more videos (at least).

Well...not really...and unfortunately this is a poorly understood concept. Some bills (indeed individual clauses) used to be voted on up to 50 times in private before they go before the entire house where MAYBE they will be voted on publicly. Type "Passed by voice vote" into Google and lots of very recent bills come up (many in the last couple months). These are bills that get passed with no names attached. The rise in roll-call voting is over 400% since 1970.
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:28:18
Your point makes a lot of sense. In fact that's how everyone has thought since 1970 when we passed the LRA1970. But recent data has shown that the opposite is likely true. And while this is counterintuitive as all getup, Martin Gilens data (Princeton 2014) and Michael Barber (BYU 2015) have both shown that since 1970 congressmen don't vote in favor of their constituency at all. But before then they did. If you get a chance watch the vid...but at least remain open to conversation on the idea...I'm not saying its right or wrong, I'm just saying the data supports my idea and not the opposite (our current system).

I'd love to visit. Our group spends a lot of time in Africa, South America and Southern Europe. Karl is from Austria.

thanks for watching. But no those images are not the mailed images, those aren't available, that's why we obscured them. we just took some torture graphics. but we needed images and we tried our best to produce ones that look like what he saw.

very true. Great use of media as well. So beautifully done.

Thanks. It is just a summary, as you said, for those looking for a quick breakdown. We'll post more tomorrow.

Thanks. Its true. We're working on it. Haven't unboxed the teleprompter yet.

Thank you, LB. Its a very important issue. And yes it was long overdue, on our end because it was a difficult piece to write and after all that we used the old version of our chart (approx 2 minutes in) already got two responses about the typos on that (ugh). But the end results were all the same. In any case, were proud of the report, and we're glad you enjoyed it.

We tried to research buttercoin for this piece, but there was almost nothing about them. How they managed to get the Bloomberg spot a month ago didn't make any sense to us.

Wow! What can I say. Karl, Alton and I went out around 4pm to play some really bad basketball and eat a little dinner...When we came back we saw all this great stuff here on this post – such warm comments and some very generous btc tips. They more than covered the price of our burritos. Thanks to everyone here - James

so true. if only you could edit youtube videos to put in the juicy new details in a beautiful way. why can't youtube behave like app stores, where they keep all the views and reviews, yet associate them with version numbers. so media developers could UPDATE!!

Thanks for watching. And yes, we think that's the right cafe, and the face is a photo of him, so we put them together. We aren't 100% sure, but the only cafe that fit all the descriptions is "Momi Toby's Revolution Cafe &amp; Art Bar - Hayes Valley - San Francisco, CA" - so yes we photoshopped that. Artistic liberties if you will.
