Only keep as much in fiat as you are willing to loose.

If he was the inventor of bitcoin, wouldn't he already be incredibly rich from the early mining of bitcoins? Why would he all of a sudden desperately want to sell it to "Google or Uber". Doesn't make much since to me... If he is the guy that made bitcoin, and his goal was to make money, but somehow managed to not be rich as F$^@ already.. Then this man is not smart enough to be the man or woman that invented bitcoin.

He doesn't know what an unbirthday is!

Supposedly...he was born in a mental institution.
And he sleeps only one hour a night.
He's a great man.

Are the Tritium vials for sale though?

"Never try to catch a falling knife" is also classic investment advice.

yeah, the "now" in this picture was back when I made the prediction for where it would go.

My newsletter does not say anything about trading. It gives top news stories, sentiment analysis, and so on, that are returned by machine learning when looking at news sites about crypto.
Edit: also, they said that crypto in general is against their policy, not that they were concerned that I was giving trading advice or something.

well, for one there is original content that I write in it, and for two how is setting up Machine Learning and putting it together into a rated report not making content. It's not like I'm just grabbing the top reddit links of the day or something here...
edit: typo

I know lots of people that don't even own crypto, but are interested in the tech and want to keep up to date about what is going on with it. I see what you are saying for sure, but I still think it is pretty weird and I personally was surprised - plus wasted a lot of time.

Thanks for the reply!
So far it looks like I have been getting some pretty useful data out of it, but I understand the concern.
Hopefully as I keep going I will be able to achieve more deep dive reports on the console.

Awesome thanks!
Maybe I can add a little info about machine learning at the bottom of the emails to help out :)

I am getting back relevant stories that are given a score that I find useful, and things such as other companies/people/topics that are being commonly mentioned together with bitcoin/other crypto. An obvious one for example is AMD being mentioned a lot alongside bitcoin. Could help when considering investments outside crypto directly as well.

I withdrew my bitcoins over 30 hours ago and have received nothing so far. I am starting to get nervous....
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:47:28
excellent, but how many blankets do you think that is all together? ^.^
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:30:00
I didn't know, my bad
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:53:33
