24 the answer to death, inexistence and nothing at all

ELI5 of quantum computer (overly overly simplified):
If a number is a product of 2 other unknown prime numbers, the only way to find them is trying every possible combination until you find the right one. If this number is long enough the process may take longer than the existence of the universe in a modern computer. Using really crazy physics properties it's theoretically possible to build a quantum machine that can overlap all this attempts to find the right one really fast.
But where's the problem? Most computational security systems rely on the fact that if anyone try to guess a solution it takes a long a time. When they finally build a quantum computer able to break this security, it will be WAAAAY more efficient than anything we have and will be able to brute Force into all of this kinds of systems, bitcoin included (it doesn't use exactly the same system but it's an ELI5).
Oh, my God there won't be anything safe on the world then? Well, we are not yet sure whether or not the machine google created have really broken the point in which all the previous security becomes obsolete (I personally don't think it did...) but it's coming closer every minute... But some quantum security systems have already been created so that quantum computers also take too long to solve. Whenever those computers really become viable bitcoin will have to adapt it's security just like every single other system in the planet...

Tonight I dreamed that bitcoin reached a million and went down to 100k in 20 minutes

OOOHH.. I haven't understood that was a raking system.. I'll go back and fill it again then
