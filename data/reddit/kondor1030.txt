There is no such think as country-specific Euro currency.

"Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money." - If my grandma reads this you can be pretty sure that you lost her. I'd prefer if the intro was a bit shorter. For example "A new kind of money"
The menu: 
Under "Introduction" you should put first "How it works" and not "Individuals"

You should talk to support. There is no such thing as free money, except Bitcoin forks.

Well, people deposit fiat in the machine, maybe not an idiot after all.

Is this the guy who invested in Tezos and Bancor ? Both crashed... not sure if I need his financial advise.

Great, leave it on Coinbase. You could also make Google Drive backup of your private keys. Then pray three years for your crypto.

Maybe Mimblewimble could be a future solution to the privacy problem.

Maybe Putin is trying to pump the price so he could sell and told all his trolls to spread the good news :D

Thanks! I have updated the infographic. Probably will define "softfork" underneath the picture to be more clear. I still need to discuss the other stuff you mentioned. As far as I understand segwid creates new style of blocks, with increased block size limit. Im referring to the Bitcoincore documentation: 
"Since old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data. New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. "(bitcoincore)
Scalability. Again referring to the documentation: 
"Moving witness data outside of the traditional block structure (but still inside a new-style block structure) means new-style blocks can hold more data than older-style blocks, allowing a modest increase to the amount of transaction data that can fit in a block."
About the mathematical problems(could have called them programming problems): after segwid the transaction identifier (txid) gets calculated without referencing the witness. Therefore wallet creators will have less problems programming their software, because this removes the third-party transaction malleability problem. (so I am referring to this as a mathematical problem, because it is difficult to describe it with 2 words). Smart contract programming should get easier as well. (i am not a programmer, but again referring to the documentation)
Yes, I agree that a bit bigger blocks don't solve the scalability problematic. It is just a minor upgrade to the network.

When I bought my Ledger Nano a few years back it didn't have any seals or plastic wrapping. They were pretty confident in their security model. Just always generate your own seed and follow Ledger's steps from their website.
