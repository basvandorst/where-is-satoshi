What's that, then? "Not replace the ability to send a physical item somewhere"

Agree. Either that or something else has gone on in the background that means they cannot honour withdrawals (not saying hacking or theft necessarily: could be the collapse of a partnership, or misinvested funds etc).
Either way, doubt you'll see anything. That being said, I HOPE you do!

This not the end of the volatility. 
As long as financial regulators, banks and other such places don't "get" it, it will still be subject to whale movement/manipulation, speculation, hacking, forking and all the other shit that - rightly or wrongly - causes instability.
As we build more tech, products and services around crypto that become \*actually useful\*, it'll stabilise...
Just not yet. $6400 is not the ceiling.

I just searched the AusPost site for 'bitcoin' and the only thing I got was an FAQ about "What can I do with my Digital iD?"
You can use that Digital iD to buy BTC on [Bitcoin.com.au]( Makes zero mention of buying via AusPost. 
So this actually all sounds like a load of schtick to get Aussies using Digital iD (at this stage, unless I missed something).

It's been said, but I'll add my vote: lawyer up &amp; sue. I'll be honest though, it's doubtful you'll see it again. Sounds to me like that place is running on air

Look, I am all for crypto (I work in this space). But this is BS, as  says:
* Card reader rental: £29/month
* Transaction fee: 1.69%
* Implied gross per week @ 1.69% = \~£7,000
* Use NFC instead of "spending a couple minutes typing in numbers"
