What the fuck do you care if people buy it or not
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:52:50
Don't pay the fucking ransom are you stupid
Edit: how can you be sure your data is actually encrypted? Have you tried booting from a live USB Linux distro?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:24:39
Are you fucking stupid?

Government shutdowns aren't uncommon.

Your method of scratching out names is ineffective

...you think I don't know that? And so I ask you again, what the fuck do you care if people buy it or not? And do you think you have to be the one to tell people what the price is as if they don't already fucking know?

*I'm a technician, actually.* And you'd be a fool to pay. You can't guarantee that you'd get your data back. And this dude has yet to exhaust his options, anyway. If he keeps trying, he might be successful. And if not, all he has to do is sit around and wait for a recovery tool to be developed. There's literally no point in pissing away $2500

Don't pay them.

did you just assume their gender?

Which wallet are you using
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:41:23
Have you tried this one yet 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:07:59
No. You never have to pay. Paying only illustrates a person's gullibility. There's no guarantee that once payment is sent you will ever get what you want. If a person was a dick enough to encrypt your data you'd be a fool to trust them.

Is this just an 'i told you so' post?
Praise be to you, purveyor of crypto knowledge...

Rofl I'm a bad technician for telling this dude not to piss away $2500? ***Fuck you.*** Resolving someone else's fuck up at your cost is called charity, not business. Report back to the client explaining that you've exhausted all options and then if the client wishes to throw $2500 in the trash then that's their stupid decision.

 I'm concerned that in time we will see vulnerabilities exploited or see a surge of Bitcoin stealing malware.

I once sent btc with a small fee using Bitcoin core. Was in limbo for weeks. Figured out that you could "abandon" the transaction. Coins "came back" to my wallet. Respent them on something else with higher fee. Tx in limbo got rejected.

@_date: 2018-02-03 07:13:32

@_date: 2018-02-03 07:08:04
..but i didnt sell. so no, you didnt.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:30:32


No. No you fucking can't. Not saying you're right or wrong in your *assumption.* But your assurances mean shit, pal.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:04:26
lol. why dont you *enlighten us?*
