My computer alone could manage probably 1.000.000 bank accounts without the need to switch on the van. There is literally no cost. It's a big database and a few admins.

What has regulation to do with that? Germany has much more regulation on this and I pay zero fees for my bank account.

What I really hate is that I had 300 litecoins back then. That's now 30k? And in a few years probably 300k and then it will be 3M! I don't want to check the prices. Makes me sad. ��

As a good investor he is following the rule, not to invest in things he does not understand. That is all.

You could get LTC for ~ $14 currently. Huobie a Chinese major exchange will add it the next time. It's officially confirmed.

That "real money" part is bullshit. The only reason gold was used as a currency is because it's hard to find. You can use everything else with these qualitys too. Bitcoin is amazing too, but only as long there is energy.

The Internet doesn't provide location info. This is done via GPS, Glonas and Galileo satellites. Every phone has an antenna and receiver for this data.
But because this method eats up a lot of the battery, Android offers different precision settings that don't need GPS. For the lowest they just check the ID of the internet access points from the mobile providers nearby (that's not Wi-Fi but these big towers/antennas were also classical phone calls go through). This consumes no extra energy but at best you can tell in what area of the city you are. Not very precise. Next best is checking for Wifi IDs and names from all these little plastic home router. Google collects this info over your phone so it's possible for your phone to know where it is when it sees the surrounding wifi networks. Most precise but also most battery draining is GPS itself. Your phone can calculate its position up to an square meter.
For all of these methods you don't really need Internet access when you downloaded the maps data before. Also your phone having no internet access, it still can read the names/ids of the access points.

He never said that honey. He said women put make up on and it is a sexual signal. He just stated the obvious. But there are a lot of bullshit artists out there who say otherwise and people are confused enough to believe them.

I bought a whole Bitcoin the other day for 147,-Euro. It felt so stupid that I didn't buy earlier. Well, only 21 million coins maximum (I read that somewhere) for the whole world will still make me rich man in a few years.
Does anyone know how many coins are already gone to /dev/null?
