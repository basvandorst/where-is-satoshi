Its called progress, its driven by optimizations, concurrency, evolution - Darwin :-)  
You may stop optimizations, be retired and out of competition any moment when you decide to quit. sorry everything are changes all the time.

You can buy hardware from Bitfury, and even from 2nd,3rd level distributors.

Do decentralization yourself, try to install 1000 miners in 1000 locations and try to efficiently support &amp; maintain them or ...build your asic's, its simple just require little bit of work like everything... sorry there is no chances to be pioneer or leader without work.

just use immersion... we did immersion cooling in 2015, already done.

Albrtarth - all in your hands.
:-) do decentralization with your own hands now. 
just build 20 individual data centers of no more than 5-10 miners per DC to avoid centralization, each DC in different parts of the world, service them independently 24/7 + maint &amp; Internet by yourself, I am sure you will be most efficient one ...
p.s. Building the chip &amp; miners also too easy task - you should know a math little bit, engineering, a bit of electronics &amp; bit of your time - I'm sure that you can assemble 10-20k for community at lower prices or for free. Everything for decentralization :-)

 *to better realize diff try to follow*... 
 * CPU ~ 1-50Mhash at  0.008-0.5 Mhash/J for Cell/MIPS/ARM/Xeon (15-325W)
 * GPU ~ 1-600Mhash at 0.7-3.4 Mhash/J Nvidia/AMD (50-550W)
 * FPGA ~ 100-900Mhash at 4-24 Mhash/J Xilinx/Alera (20-75W)
 * 1st/genASIC's ~ 1500-5000 Mhash at 500-2500 Mhash/J
 * 5th/genASIC's ~ 15 000 000 Mhash at 10 000 Mhash/J 
 Can you see evolution now per 1 Joule ? 
ASIC's generate 15 000 000 more hashes, consuming 200 000 times less electrical energy ...this all about the optimization, mathematical &amp; engineering optimizations, same as modern LED vs Edison Bulb... more light on less consumption.

Bitfury sell hashrate to outside ~400Phs sold &amp; DC upgrade.
