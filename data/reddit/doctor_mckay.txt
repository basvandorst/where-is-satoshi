Both  and  are working fine on my end.
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:36:13


Exactly. The only reason why Bitcoin can't be counterfeited is because it doesn't have a physical bill/coin. And that's a downside, not an upside.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:06:13
And then we have a ton of different bills issued by different companies, and some stores might only accept Company X's bills but not Company Y's bills.

It's basically a combination of email and online banking. You send money to an *address*.

Fraud is irrelevant. Credit card fraud most commonly happens when someone steals a credit card or a customer is dishonest about a chargeback.
Bitcoin fraud can happen via stolen wallet.dat files and dishonest merchants.

Passwords should always be *stored* hashed, but as long as the transmission is encrypted it doesn't particularly matter how they're sent.
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:37:14
An electronic fiat based system also prevents counterfeiting. Counterfeiting is a weakness of physical currency, that's all. Bitcoin doesn't have one, and that's a downside.

I absolutely love it. I got a VPS from [Backupsy]( and set it up with AjaXplorer and a cheap SSL certificate. It parallels Dropbox and works great! AjaXplorer even has an option to generate publicly-accessible download links, just like Dropbox.
There's even an AjaXplorer app ($0.99, but worth it). It's pretty much amazing. AjaXplorer also has an integrated text editor.
Here's a [non-affiliate link]( but I'd hugely appreciate it if you'd use my link in the first paragraph if you're interested! Use the coupon HOLYMOSES to get the 250 GB version for $5 monthly, or GOTMEADEAL to get the 500 GB version for $7 monthly.
Outside of Backupsy, Bittorrent Sync works just like Dropbox, but it also allows you to sync any number of folders on your computer, and their subfolders. So it's basically unlimited Dropboxes.
For privacy's sake, I disabled the tracker and relay options, opting to instead input my VPS' URL into the client.

This headline (and article) is highly sensationalized.
It's been known from the get-go that if any person or pool obtained 51% of the network's processing power, it would essentially control the network. This is why we encourage people to avoid joining the popular pools so that they don't make up too large a percentage of the network.
That being said, even at 51% I don't think someone could effectively "control" Bitcoin. The protocol would right itself after two weeks by increasing the difficulty, and as soon as the "big dog" starts breaking protocol and issuing themselves coins they don't deserve, the rest of the network would exclude them.

Nothing is hosted on Namecoin, as it is just an alternative DNS. You still connect to the server on the other end using plain old Internet. The only thing that's different is that nobody can seize the domain name.

No. Transactions are confirmed by miners, no action is required on your part to accept transactions. Anyone can see the balance of any Bitcoin address. You can add you address to a Blockchain.info wallet as "Listen Only" and you'll be able to see transactions as they come in, but you won't be able to send money until you get the private key.
