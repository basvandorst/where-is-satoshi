You could very well use that same argument for the dollar or any currency.
Stocks also don’t generate any value, it only acts as a vehicle for transferring it with an expectation of return. The generated value comes from the workers.

What even is this thread

Not to launch into a libertarian argument, but it isn't about whether roads would get built or not. It's the quality and consistency and accessibility everyone has to them.

The fluctuating price and initial fiat capital. Let's be real, BTC won't pay my bills any time soon. I need to convert it into fiat to live and when I get paid on Thursday at 2pm and the price sinks 5-10% on a normal day I have to wait or accept a pay cut. I have to work around traditional banking infrastructure to get my cash out, which makes timing... awkward.
This is mostly solved by having a solid amount of savings in fiat to start the whole process with. I didn't but now I do. This gives you freedom to choose when to convert BTC to fiat. Fun side note, I lived in Iceland and worked for a company that paid out EUR instead of the local ISK. The bank would convert by button press as well. The government did tax any gains from profiting off this exchange (as any country does) but they also correct for losses which was nice. This gave me exposure to this type of thing beforehand.
I don't really like dispensing speculative investment opinion to people I don't know. At the moment I hold BTC and ETH. Whether you see crypto as a store of value or a currency for the exchange of goods, you are still investing in one or the other. BTC is on a bit of shaky ground at the moment. The highly speculative price coupled with the drama related to BCH is hurting crypto as a whole short term. The sooner Lightning is enabled, proves its own claims, and the block size for BTC is increased (has to happen with Lightning anyway) the sooner we can move past this whole debacle and get to the real work. I'm taking a wait and see approach while holding a majority of my worth in crypto. 
Another thing to note is that we're a long way off from using it as currency. I'd love to see us get there and the company I work for is making strides in that area, but it's going to be a lot of work.

A bitcoin exchange
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:45:36
Yea it's actually pretty neat. The whole team is remote, and getting hired there was actually my reintroduction to bitcoin after a foray back in 2012. I've lived abroad before and have intentions of doing so again and the ease of which I can transport my currency and avoid the "Are you carrying $10,000 with you?" type stuff is pretty neat.

In before the "I don't use roads!" exclaimed on an internet connected to by a computer dependent on multinational infrastructure.

I also get paid in BTC, and also convert what I need for the month into fiat, and hold the rest. I live in the US, for now.

There are so many things... the ancap nature of crypto (or at least most crypto advocates), seemingly being for communism, how does bitcoin create communism? russia won the war, not the US, so thanks Stalin. I'm still unpacking your sentence in my mind.

I get ya, but everything is political.
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:38:46
But has it even done that yet?
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:23:42
Yep, was invented 1100 years ago but fire arrows and bombs were being crafted and used in warfare 1000 years ago by the Chinese. Pretty neat.
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:26:12
So basically purely because they want bitcoin. Is there a reason other than that?
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:19:19
You could, but given how bitcoin is behaving recently, they're going to need more incentive than that to offset the risk. There's a reason businesses have been dropping it (it's not ready)
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:54:09
It's not bullshit. As a vendor myself I'm skeptical of accepting payments in Bitcoin. I'm simply extrapolating that out. It might not be correct but it isn't bullshit.
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:28:30
Visa and Mastercard apparently limit chargebacks to 1% of your sales. This is not really a problem that bitcoin would solve for almost any business.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:38:07
Why would a merchant want to do that?
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:26:39
Given the volatility, that could change in an hour.
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:23:01
True story. I'm am confident it will happen though, I just don't think there's much reason as a merchant to accept it now unless you can afford to run your business on speculation.
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:50:37
That's a good point. A good reason then for a merchant to accept it, though I still wouldn't say enough of one given the risk. The flip side is the new risk for the customer, but if a merchant is accepting and someone chooses to purchase with bitcoin, they understand that risk. Or will.

What was something positive that came about in the development of Bitcoin as a result of that competition (Bcash existing)?
