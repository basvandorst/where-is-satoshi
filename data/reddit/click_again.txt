Assuming the majority BTC seller in the market now is the miners (yes trader do sell but they sell and buyback as trading goes on, trader profit over the spread). BTC miners had to constantly and continuously sell for fiat because they need to pay electricity, maintenance, wages, and rental. The selling price from miners dictates the floor. Taking into current difficulty, the cost to produce 1 BTC in a normal mine in China is approximately $9k. This is the lowest price the most efficient miners on earth will sell.
Remember miners have to sell constantly to pay in fiat. After the halvening, for every $9k spent, the miners only get 0.5BTC instead of 1BTC. This means the cost to make 1BTC is $18k assuming the difficulty and competition doesn't catch up. At that point do you think the miners will sell their BTC at $9k or $18k? The miners aren't stupid. In fact they are among the smartest to be able to make money in mining currently.
That's why I said the current price of BTC is still a good buy. The halvening will push the price to 18k minimum. And for now the halvening effect has not kicken in just yet. Normally it is few months before the halvening, depending on the financial state of the miners. A miner that is more cash rich will hodl the BTC mined until the price gain traction after halvening to profit more.
@_date: 2019-07-31 05:33:45
At this point I dont think it is pure luck anymore. Bitcoin is destined to moon after halving. 
Look at the chart 
The price after halving never return back to the price at the date of halving. The miners are not stupid to sell at the same price when the cost to mine one BTC is doubled. We only have 290 days to buy. OP is correct. I will see OP at the moon.
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:09:29
That article had me chuckled.  
Well, we have a Bitcoin quote for baseless fud like this, as in tradition.


@_date: 2019-07-10 13:57:49
That's because of the implementation of DDA in bch. Satoshi designed the halvening schedule and it is retained in bitcoin protocol, not bch protocol.
The clowns that forked bitcoin to create bch went against many of satoshi's implementations, one of them being the difficulty adjustment. Bch termed it as dynamic difficulty adjustment [DDA], where the difficulty is adjusted every 10 minutes. This is mainly intended by bcashers with the purpose to win the hash war back then during fork.
This is why bch implemented DDA to win hash back then (although we all know such attempt fail miserably):
1) immediately upon the fork, dump BTC for BCH temporarily to attract more hashrate to mine on the BCH fork, as mining bch is more profitable temporarily.
2) however as more miners are onboard and difficulty spike, bch become less profitable to mine unless the bch investor continue to prop up its price which is unsustainable. In order to retain the miners from switching back to btc, DDA will ensure miners get bch mining rewards every 10minutes.
3) however, majority users think bch fork does not work/ not the right scaling approach and continue to stay with btc. Most of the btc holders who get bch for free also proceed to dump bch. At one point mining on bch chain isn't even profitable enough although mining reward is guaranteed every 10minutes. Bch undergoes a massive dump as users compete to get rid of their bag.
The rest is history
@_date: 2019-07-21 11:52:11
not really. in fact, mining without the block reward is completely fine as the miners can still collect transaction fee.
if the transaction fee is too low for certain miners who have higher operating cost, such miners will shutdown. the network difficulty will adjust, so the miners who are efficient will run just fine.
@_date: 2019-07-21 12:06:17
similarly, I too was scammed into buying BCH thinking it is bitcoin when I'm new to crypto. it confused the hell out of me, but didn't take too long for me to realize. anyway damage was done resulting in me having less BTC than I should. From that point onwards I'm determined that BCH scam has to die.
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:19:11
Well the bcashers in rbtc are already doing so. The bad habits of scamming and lying are still prevalent in bch community. Anyway, I see they are slowly being exhausted.
- bch investors spend huge money promoting the bch wallet despite it comes with the highly insecure 0conf functionality. Loud marketing but adoption is not rising. Bch play the old trick of listing xxx numbers of merchant accepting bch but actually not even 1% of the listed merchant does.
- bch investors giving free money to citizens of Venezuela in hope for them to spread adoption. Ending up the free bch is exchanged for btc, further fueling the btc transaction in Venezuela localbitcoin. Out of no hope bch promoters have to grab innocent childrens holding dummy mobile phone for advertisement purpose.
Still an ever empty highway after all of the false advertising. Still an ever bleeding alt against btc value.
And now the bch dev is asking for community donation so the development can continue. :thinking:

Bitmain's BTC mining infrastructure consists of:
* **Hardware** \- Bitmain has the largest market share of ASIC mining machines at the moment, but that doesn't mean it will last. Innosilicon and canaan are now actually selling a faster ASIC at a higher price and they are always sold out. Bitmain will be eaten alive when the 10nm Samsung asic chip go into mass production and enter the mining market.
* **Pools** \- Most of the SHA-256 hashrate points to BTC. While a majority of big pools are affiliated with Bitmain, there is no way to prevent miners from hoping to another pools. Miners will definitely pool hop when a pool go offline/maliciously shut down by Bitmain.
* The BCH camp can only theoretically pull a 51% attack to BTC if and only if all of the below happens altogether, at once, at a synchronized fashion.
   * \- Bitmain shutdown all its affiliated pools, forcing the "honest miners" who mine on bitmain pools to be offline.
   * \- Bitmain then launch a hardware backdoor to the remaining online miners who are not in bitmain pools, forcing the "honest miners" in non-bitmain-control-pools to be offline as well.
   * \- Now with most of the "honest" SHA-256 hashing power is offline, Bitmain points all of its SHA-256 hash power to mine a specific curated "dishonest block", hard-forking an "dishonest chain", and broadcast to most of the nodes ASAP. Wuala! Then we have a fork.
   * \- There are a few ways to deal with this dishonest fork. One of them can be a "rolled-back" just like how ETH and ETC did it. Or the community can ditch the dishonest fork, etc. If this really happens in the future, I would like to prematurely call the forked coin as jihancash(JCH).
   * \- and yet, after all of this it does not benefit BCH/Bcash in any way because Bcash is just another hard fork from BTC. The difference is, BCH fork is not done by miners, but by scam artists.

Last Friday - US-China trade talks ended in a bad note. China had not followed through on a promise to buy more U.S. farm products in the previous deal. Trump announced 10% tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, in addition to the 25% already levied on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. Market responded. Sea of reds.
Weekends - Speculation of trade impacted sectors and reposition of longs/shorts. HongKong riots continue with intense clashes.
Sunday night - Nikkei opened in the red. BTC saw the green hourly candle. Then HangSeng and Shanghai opened red. Bitcoin started to challenge 11k but couldn't breach just yet. Then Yuan fucking broke 7 and followed by the sea of red in other Asia markets. At this point Bitcoin surged to 11.5k with massive capital flocking out of China. The capital is pouring into other assets and commodities, including Bitcoin. Gold +0.8%, BTC +5%. Shitcoins +1%. BTC dominance broke 70%.
Now - More capital exodus from China. BTC is 11.7k now. For people arguing Yuan breaking 7 is good to China because it helps with its export. You're fucking wrong. CCP can devalue their Yuan all day long. But Trump will just raise you more tariff until you're drown. Also, a weak Yuan will harm China more than its good because China still has to buy oil in USD. China still has to import many other commodities from the world, mostly in USD. Just look at the import volume in China. Now the citizens in China need to pay a higher cost to afford the same products because their buying power has dropped. Meanwhile the riches in China has already moved their wealth to other assets.

Forks such as BCH is not only centralized, it has little to no security. Current hash rate on BCH = 2EH. This is a fucking joke. Blockstream facility can go double of that easily.
Impending doom for BCH. It's inevitable for it to be 51%-ed.
For those who's not aware, BCH was 51%-ed on May 15, 2019. That day is yet another hardfork of BCH where the dev fucked up the code but no one spotted it before implementing the hardfork. During the hardfork, a smart miner exploit the dev mistake, which allows him to move coins from unspentable address (making the coin spentable again). BTC.com and BTC.top (same miner entity using different name) then colluded to 51% the network to take coins away from that miner. Bcashers argued that this colluded attack is good/morally right thing to do. I see it as authoritarian and centralized censorship. The event showed that BCH mining is so centralized it's the worst form of altcoins out there, one miner alone dictate whether you can move your coins, or not.

Bitcoin is the most distributed and decentralized blockchain out there. Just look at the number of full nodes on the network, it's growing constantly  at the pace which of all other altcoin cant keep up. The network effect is just going to be strengthened and reinforced as time passes.
You can imagine Google in search engine. As most of the people are using it, Google can improve constantly by harnessing its Big Data, something that other search engine does not have. The rate of improvement by Google is faster than other competitors, hence further reinforced its advantage. Bitcoin's advantage is similarly due to its network effect. I am confident with Bitcoin network security given its decentralization. It is my hard-earned money and I just couldn't put it on other networks that can be 51% or reorg easily. I also couldn't imagine a new altcoin suddenly emerge to replace it because this is an open source space. If an altcoin tech is so good, other coin will just follow suit and the field is even out

Nope you are the one claiming merchants are retarded. I'm saying merchants are being scammed by Bcashers because they are tricked to use BCH. They are suffering due to the double-spending on-going in BCH.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:13:00
BCH likelihood of being double-spent on is not worth to be a P2P money. That's the truth and is evidently proved to happen every so often in BCH.
Bitcoin transaction is many times more secure and no exploits is being reported for RBF, while BCH double-spending is a common problem. And while you talk about the poor merchant, the poor merchant will absolutely lose his funds because of the insecurities in BCH.
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:48:50
LOL paying a fudster to defame Bitcoin is always a false advertising done by Bcasher. Remember forcing children to take photo with BCH banner? Any coin can do the same thing.

Well no body prevent you to check your Bcash hashrate, price and 0conf vulnerabilities.


Too bad alts are at their ATL against BTC. When BTC rise, your scam coin BCH drops


I was leaving to go on to my trip buddy. When I'm back you deleted your comments in r/futurology and r/bitcoin like a pussy to avoid you from being seen as a sore loser. Please do not delete your comments again this time. Please do not be a pussy like the owner of your Twitter handle deleting Bitcoin comments. r/btc on the contrary, is a censored sub where the mod is a scammer/felony himself that a fair discussion is not possible. r/btc also rate-limited the honest commentators to create a fake impression that censorship does not exist in that sub, but the fact is rate-limiting one's discussion is the worst form of censorship because it's trying to fraud the public by pretending it's the censorship-free sub like rbitcoin. This is consistent with the true nature of your coin leaders: lies (roger ver scamming newcomers to buy BCH) and lies (Jihan Wu selling used miner to customer) and lies (CSW claiming himself as Satoshi)


Nope. I am talking about sidechains which are already being actively developed on Bitcoin and ETH. 2nd layer network are developed on Bitcoin and LTC. Bitcoin has the capacity in the main chain, side chains and 2nd layer network. While BCH and BSV are still stuck at 1st layer tech.

Re-org protection just prevents re-org, it does not prevent the coin from 51% attack or double-spending. An attacker is not interested to re-org and to rollback the chain. An attacker is interested in double-spending, which will be achieved with sufficient hash power to the network especially when the nethash is so low.

Too bad he didn't implemented them. On the other hand, Satoshi implemented 1MB which BCH go against and destroyed. Bitcoin implements what Satoshi implemented. BCH violates the implementation of Satoshi by introducing DDA, removal of his 1MB cap and tokenisation.


wrong. Bitcoin Cash hard forked the chain and deviates from the original direction, because Bitcoin Cash is centralised hence is no longer a peer-to-peer electronic cash. As outlined in the whitepaper, the chain with the highest accumulated POW is the honest chain. BCH and BSV does not have the highest accumulated POW, hence both BCH and BSV is not Bitcoin.


That's another way around dude. BTC is rising and BCH is falling. The last I checked, BCH is at its ATL to Bitcoin? What happen?

I know about the inflation bug introduced at version 0.15 which are patched out at version 0.16. BCH devs did not even have the capacity to pull off the attack because the number of nodes running 0.15 at that time is so abysmally low compared to 0.14 and below. Never really a threat, but I appreciate they reveal it in return to the flavour of Bitcoin Core developer publish about their bug at a much earlier time.
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:40:58
I hope Bitcoin miners stay away from using pools like BTC.com, BTC.top and pools controlled by roger ver. Those pools are pro BCH and will direct your hashrate to BCH when the pool operators deem fit. You can't be trusting them with your money if they just use your hashrate on whatever chain/purpose they like.
Entity like Blockstream can pull an 51% attack on BCH as they have so much hashpower, enabling them to double spend BCH.
For those curious how double spending on BCH is possible and can be executed, please google search what happen to Bitcoin Gold on May 2018. Basically one entity gotten so much hash power that it can split the network into two chains, while maintaining both chain with enough POW for an extended time. He then send the coins to exchanges dumping it for Bitcoin. After selling off the BTG on the chain he spent, he shut down the hashpower on that chain and maintain the hashpower on another chain which he didn't send BTG to the exchange. He earned 18million from such move alone. Needless to say BTG took a severe dump of price that day as he just sell it for BTC, free.
I can't wait for something similar happening to BCH. For those who still have stake in BCH or BSV, get out before it's too late!
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:05:09
Bitcoin did not work like the way BCH work.
BCH violated the 1MB implementation by Satoshi. Bitcoin maintains it.
BCH violated the difficulty adjustment by Satoshi via DDA. Bitcoin maintains it.
BCH violated the P2P aspect by Satoshi via 0conf. Bitcoin maintains the P2P aspect.
BCH is centralised and insecure which is not advocated by Satoshi. Bitcoin maintains the vision of Satoshi.

not to be worried too much. you can think Bitcoin similar to commodity like gold.
* When the economy is moving up, capital will move to stock/business that gives best return (albeit with higher risk).
* When the economy is slowing down, capital will move to bonds because it's relatively low risk.
* when the economy is in crisis, or when the investors feel too much uncertainty in the market, or during the war (cold war, trade war, currency war - not the actual "war" like WWII), etc, capital will flock to gold / rare metals.
Note that gold is not constantly the most desired compared to other investments. Its period of desirability depends on the state of the economy. Capital will not move towards gold when the economy is doing alright. Because gold itself does not give you interest. 1oz of gold is still 1oz of gold next 5 years. I'll rather put the money on something that gives me a higher return. Similar to BTC.
But gold is highly desired in the period of uncertainty. Although being a commodity that didn't generate interest/return, I rest assured that my portfolio is protected by gold during a crisis. Its price also goes up in long term perspective, despite slower than stock.  Similar to BTC, except BTC possess other traits that gold doesn't have - programmability, fungibility, and speed.
Remember, like gold, BTC is a long term investment. It's new and volatile now. But rest assured it will give a return no other tools can best in 5-10 years time.

Segwit and RBF is implemented via soft-fork which maintains Satoshi's consensus. Meanwhile Bcash hardforked by removing Satoshi's 1MB cap, DDA, and 0conf. Bcash is by definition a dishonest chain in Satoshi's Whitepaper because Bcash is a chain with minority POW.

Bitcoin mining algorithm is SHA-256. Some forks of Bitcoin (such as BCH, BSV) also based on the same mining algorithm. At the moment, the nethash of SHA-256 coins are:
|*Coin with SHA256 as mining algorithm*|*Nethash*|
|Bitcoin|75.9 EH/s|
|BSV|1.1 EH/s|
|BCH|1.7 EH/s|
What OP said is that Blockstream mining facility can generate up to 6EH/s, which leads to a potential security risk in alts such as BCH and BSV.
For an example, BCH only has 1.7 EH as its whole nethash at the moment. Mining entities (not necessarily has to be Blockstream) with hashpower greater than 0.85EH/s can 51% attack BCH. OP is warning about this risk and imply BCH and BSV holders should condiser that risk too. 51% attack is primarily known to do double-spending, hence damaging the credibility, confidence, and price of the coin. Bitcoin forks such as BCH and BTG was hit by 51% attack previously (51% attack on BCH at 15th May 2019, 51% attack on BTG at 29th May 2018).
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:49:26
Bitcoin rise on it's own just fine while scam coins such as BCH and BSV drop in value when Bitcoin is on the rising. Since the inception, BCH and BSV has been losing values to Bitcoin as the market realise your scams and lies.
BCH dev is too technical incompetent to scale BCH via other solutions. Also BCH leaders are too ego to move on to the 2nd layer solution because they have publicly spoken about how bad is 2nd layer and trashing the off-chain scaling approaches adopted by other competitors.
Anyway, I do not see BCH implementing the side-chain and off-chain scaling solutions any time soon because BCH has 0 adoption. Look at your empty highway. The market do not adopt your altcoin because it's insecure, illiquid and is centralized. Your BCH and BSV are laughable.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:53:19
Well I see that most merchants who're hurt by the insecurities and vulnerabilities in Bcash are leaving. BCH TX are going down by the day tho which proof this.

@_date: 2019-08-20 06:31:57
By the definition of Whitepaper, the fork with the minority POW is the dishonest fork, hence BCH.
While Segwit and RBF maintains the network consensus via softfork, BCH is a contentious hard fork from Bitcoin, hence it does not follow the consensus rule set by Satoshi.

I'm offering and opening more and more facade of our argument since you cant refute my points while resorting to churning foul words.
I'm comprehending well enough all your arguments while providing factual rebuttal but you keep ignoring them. Let's recap before your pussily delete your comments again:
1) I pointed out the vulnerabilities in BCH 0conf.
2) You commented BCH 0conf is "perfectly fine". (which I screenshotted)
3) I then provided a link showing the double-spending state in BCH.
4) You proceed to verify my link and cited it that BCH is secure. You also use it as your argument without looking into the details the link provided LOL. You call for non-deletion of our comments.
5) I agree and screenshot it in case your delete again. I then show you the proof of double-spending in the link which I have gave several records of vulnerabilities.
6) You then admitted the vulnerabilities and cried that 90% is "good enough" for merchant.
7) I mentioned the exploit rate of 1 out of 10 is not fit to be a P2P money, users being exploited one out of ten transaction is dangerous which makes BCH a shittier coin than most shitcoins out there.
8) You then unable to rebut it and continue to blur the lines with Blockstream conspiracy theory, going full strawman while unable to provide a counterargument.
9) You continue to accuse me by going personal and further diverting the attention away from the BCH scam.
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:53:36
It does not matter if the transaction is high value or low value. If the transaction is not secure in Bcash due to the high risk of being invalidated by double-spends, how can the public use it as a sound P2P money?
BCASH literally violated the Bitcoin whitepaper because it cease to become a true P2P money.
Thanks for foul-calling me as the troll while what I did is simply pointing out the fact that you have agreed on yourself. Even you yourself have acknowledged that double-spending is very happening in BCH. Please do not be a strawman when you cannot defend with facts and truth.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:44:27
That's the thing, the 0conf in BCH payment processors are being exploited to do double-spending.

Do not go full strawman, stay civil in the discussion of 0conf and payment processor shall we?
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:42:40
Thanks for promising not to delete it so everyone can see that how insecure is BCH.
10% failure in a P2P cash system is too freaking high. If I know I am not getting paid for every 1 out of 10 sales that I made I might as well switch to other coins which is more secure such as Bitcoin which is faster and way cheaper to transact with.
It doesn't matter how fast is your coin. If it is not secure and is always being double-spent on, the coin is worse that the shittest of shitcoins. Bitcoin 2nd layer solutions are even faster than the insecure BCH 0conf, while offering instant, feeless and secure transactions.

more like deleting comments to hide the fact that you are a Bcash bag holder. Luckily my comments help newbies to differentiate Bcash from Bitcoin.  
Bcash / BSV = The scam coins trying to market themselves as real bitcoin.  
Bitcoin = An open source P2P money which is fast, decentralized, supported by thousands and thousands of invidual nodes (the Bitcoin Core software client) hosted across the globe.


Bitcoin done many times more than that via sidechains and on the 2nd layer network. Meanwhile BCH and BSV are stuck on 1st layer network. Bitcoin is the global currency many times better than Bcash and BSV combined.


More like Bcash can't take the pressure by deleting comments over and over again. Not just with you, u/old63 oldman. It happens the same to your BCash twitter handle owner deleting tweets about Bitcoin LOLX

@_date: 2019-08-10 08:00:52
I am not saying it's a bad thing. Like I said, I appreciate that they reveal it. 0.16 was supripisingly being worked on immediately after 0.15 release and the rumours is that few Core dev discover it and decided to work on it before posting update. BCH dev look at the 0.16 commits and figured out something, hence making a big deal about it. 0.16 was rolled out less than 24 hours after that.
BCH dev revealing the issue is because
1) they could not exploit it before 0.16 is rolled out
2) they want to repay the BCH bug pointed out by Bitcoin dev Cory Field on Aug 2018

Yes. As far as coins in blockchain is concern, BTC cannot be replaced. This is because the blockchain space is open-source. If a coin tech is so good, everyone will just copy its source code and implement it, including BTC. BTC can only be replaced by a tech better than blockchain itself (which we all do not know yet).
Like Google search be replaced by another entity (not a search engine). This entity will not beat Google by creating a better search engine. It beat Google by predicting what user may ask Google and present the answer in advance, rendering google search useless (just an example). This however is most likely be implemented by Google first than anyone else, again due to its advantage in network effect.
Edit to include your question regarding banditcleaner's comment:
If a group of smart people with 180+ IQ managed to create a better coin that have better tech, and that tech is so so good, then all other coin will just copy the tech. This is an open-source space. Go to github and you can copy bitcoin sourcecode and create your own coin. That's how altcoins are born.

The highway will not have the sufficient capacity to compete with Bitcoin because Bitcoin transaction happens at all 3 levels while Bcash transaction happens at 1 level (on-chain) only. The problem with Bcash is, the on-chain transaction is so low in volume signifying low rate of adoption. Just compare your TX with Bitcoin TX. Bitcoin TX crushed BCH TX in all aspect.
BCH is also centralised due to low number of independent nodes, and BCH network is also susceptible to 51% attack due to your low network hashrate. Only a meager percentage of Bitcoin network hashrate. TSK.

You need to learn more about that exchange before buying and storing your bitcoin long-term in that exchange. Exchanges always have the risk of exit scam (read Mt.gox and  QuadrigaCX). If there is no viable way to buy Bitcoin in Philippines except Coins.ph then you should buy and transfer it to your personal wallet instead of leaving your Bitcoin on that exchange long term.

Bitcoin cash does not work because it's insecure, always being double-spent on and has high risk that the merchant will lose their fund during the transaction.

Agree with that. Except that centralization bites back. It's literally worsed than fiat if the centralized entity can decide which transaction can be allowed or censored.
Let say I own 100BCH. And one day I somehow pissed off Roger Ver. Roger Ver then collude with the miners to censor my transaction because the network is centralized in their hands. Suddenly my 100BCH is worth nothing because it cannot be transacted, making me a forever bag holder.

To me BTC should at least worth 60k in 8 years time. The cost to produce 1BTC is approximately 7.5k now. After the halvening next year, the cost to produce 1BTC is 15k. Another 4 years, the cost is 30k. Another 4 years later it be 60k.
I reckon BTC is an long term investment. BTC grow from 0 to 20k in 10 years. For me to dca and hodl another 8 years is not that hard anyway. After 8 years I will retired for good.

LTC mining algorithm is Scrypt (Bitcoin is SHA256). So the new miners have no jackshit to do with LTC.
LTC - BTC price ratio is still down compared to 1 week ago. More impressive than most alts out there but I can't relate how this got to do with BTC market dominance.
I'm not a hater of LTC. Of all coins out there I only hate the scam coins that pretend/market themselves as real Bitcoin.

BCH is cheap and fast at the moment because of empty highway and little-to-no adoption. Talking about speed, Lightning works way faster than BCH.


Bitcoin is digital cash and Bitcoin stay true to the whitepaper. Not only that, Bitcoin stay true to Satoshi's code implementation.
BCH violates the whitepaper and Satoshi design because of its DDA and tokenisation. Satoshi's whitepaper essentially said that the chain with highest accumulated POW is the true and honest chain. Hence, BCH is not Bitcoin although it copied Bitcoin original chain because BCH accumulated POW is lower than Bitcoin. Calling BCH as Bitcoin is essentially violation to the Whitepaper, or simply put it, scam.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:26:06
BCH development is being halted on-chain only because BCH has no adoption and even BCH want to go off-chain scaling, the Bcash leaders will not allow it due to ego and lack of dev competency. Bcash block size is not sustainable just look at how many full nodes your network have. Meanwhile BTC full node is decentralised because it adopt the implementation set by Satoshi himself.

I respect Monero devs and their level of diligence for always forking away from ASIC. I have mining rigs that mine XMR too but I always exchange it to Bitcoin. The upcoming RandomX is fine.
But to me privacy coin faces a major hurdle and risk ahead because KYC and AML is a requirement in most transparent businesses. Also, second layer built on Bitcoin can achieve high level of privacy as well. I think XMR and many privacy coin could not go far when LN is made user-friendly.

PoS leads to new, worse form of centralization.
POW can lead to centralization, yes, but it's a battle of computing tech, rate of electricity, real-world R&amp;D, geo-location, man-power and cost of the facility (warehouse rental, etc). Being rich alone will not guarantee your edge because there are many other aspects your competitor can overtake you. The complexity in POW competition helps decentralization.
POS is purely rich guy gets richer. The dev and early investors during ETH ico back in July 2014 (yes they do have an ICO for ETH, started in bitcointalk.org) will forever control the coin. Cmon they have a huge bag no common ETH holders have.
Also, just take a look at the all coin that gone POS from POW. They market it as mixed POS or masternode or mixed POW+POS, the results are the same -
1. centralisation and the one who has the most coin literally own the chain
2. those who own the most coin just earn new coins without any effort. They simply earn so so much more. The stake in small investors hand can never ever overtake the whales. Whales just got richer than ever every other day, they dump their coin -&gt; coin fall in price

With the number of supporters on Bitcoin (rbitcoin) vs the number of supporters on Bcash (rbtc), we can easily take over the rbtc sub. We simply don't do it atm because we're too busy irl earning more just to purchase more bitcoins.
Got a hour free time? Instead of stomping rbtc I suggest we use it for reading, exercising or anything to improve our earnings irl (eg working). This will make us richer than bcashers and when we decided to stomp rbtc in future, we will do it in a coordinated way and it will last for months and years. This is how we get back rbtc.
Bcash and bsv are the least of my concern now, I only trigger them for the lulz casually when I am on reddit. How to make sure I am able to dca in bitcoin more every month is my 1st priority.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:37:58
By your logic then is BSV is the real Bitcoin because it has all the Opcodes? Bitcoin maintains the Opcodes finalised by Satoshi. BCH and BSV put in all the Opcodes that's half-cooked and is not even implemented by Satoshi. The removal of 1MB cap set by Satoshi and DDA is a direct disrespect to him.

What if you sell at 11200 and it never dip below 11200? Then you only made 2x gains and the worst is in order to get back the BTC you sold now you have to pay more to buy back in.
No one can precisely time the Bitcoin price and execute "buy low, sell high" with ease. Hodl is much easier and less emotional than trade. Instead of spending time trading for more bitcoin, hodlers can just focus the time and energy irl to earn fiat and buy more bitcoin.
At this stage we are out of the bear market and the signs are pointing towards a steady bull. Halvening is imminent. I am just as greedy as you and I simply do not satisfied with a mere 2x gains.

Bitcoin did what Satoshi talked about and maintain the implementation done by Satoshi. BCH violates the implementation put in-place by Satoshi and go against it. The code by Satoshi is destroyed when BCH introduced DDA and tokenisation.
Segwit is user-activated soft fork which represent the consensus, as outlined by Satoshi in the Whitepaper. BCH is anti-consensus and hence is anti-whitepaper.


Huh? BCH is only 0.027 of Bitcoin? When can BCH rise vs. Bitcoin? When can flippening happen?


But the empty highway? I can't see adoption in BCH tbh.


Not interested to use a scam coin tho
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:00:49
Lightning does not work in BCH because BCH dev will cripple the development on the 1st layer only. Scaling via side-chain and off-chain is a direct slap-on-face for Roger Ver who publicly declare that BCH needs no off-chain solution.
Also, the side-chain and off-chain speed in BCH will be much lower than BTC because no normal individuals are able to run BCH full node as the blockcap is being increased to an unsustainable size. BCH is essentially a centralised coin controlled by a felony and a scammer.

Make your Bcash block size to be 1MB and the fees will still be the same, no need for the big block. Because nobody ever uses Bcash the scam coin. Bcash is very centralised and if anything I rather use nano which is also a centralised coin but without fee.

i7 in a **desktop** with proper air flow and good case design can mine some altcoin, although will not be profitable unless electricity is free (where you can make 0.03 - 0.05 $ per day depending on the altcoin you choose, then exchange the altcoin for BTC).  i7 in a **laptop** shall not mine anything because the generated heat will damage it in no time.
What you can do to earn BTC using that laptop is, to run a lightning node (assuming the laptop is always online, as in mining). Collecting routing fees will net you sats (as in mining) while minus the trouble of spoiling the laptop prematurely.

Look like you are the one who need education more.
Here is the crypto 101:
1. Bitcoin is BTC. BTC is Bitcoin.
2. BCH hard forked from Bitcoin on August 2017.
3. BCH hardforked from Bitcoin because CSW, Jihan Wu and Roger Ver 's preferred BIP can't get enough support from nodes and miners of the network. Instead of following the consensus, they forked off with their own chain so they can deploy their own set of rules. These rules deviated from Bitcoin whitepaper and that's why they were not supported by majority Bitcoin nodes and miners.
4. BCH implementation which includes 0conf, DDA and tokenisation violates Bitcoin Whitepaper so BCH is not Bitcoin.
5. The Bitcoin whitepaper stated that the website address is [ which make absolutely no mention on BCH. In fact, what the website mentioned is BTC. Because BTC is Bitcoin.
6. Calling BCH / BCHABC / BCHSV as Bitcoin is scam.
7. BCH has extremely low adoption that no one even trade it. The exchange of my country, OKEx even removed the BCH trading pairs because of insufficient liquidity.
8. BCH and BSV are scam coins pretending to be Bitcoin.

BCH claiming it is the real bitcoin while it's not = scam


BCH is worst in every way, because BCH is centralised, deviates from whitepaper, low hashrate, empty highway, low adoption, slow in transaction, high fee, subpar developer, illiquid, and most likely will crash to zero becoming worthless the second bitmain dump their bag to the market.

The thing with bcash is that it has an obnoxious community trying hard to fud bitcoin and shill their coin just to offload their heavy bags.

The funny thing about bcash is:
Bcashers claiming bcash being the real bitcoin because it has larger block size than btc and it use that to scale. Well, if bigger block is the real bitcoin, does it mean bsv is the real bitcoin? That joke has 128mb block size. Definitely not. Right?
Bcash claim to be the real bitcoin because it is more aligned to the whitepaper. False. Bcash no longer held true to the whitepaper with its implementation of DDA, 0conf, and tokenisation in the protocol. BTC not only held true to the whitepaper, it also follow Satoshi code and design of 1MB cap.
Bcasher say it is the real bitcoin because it has lower fee. Lmao. Wrong! Bsv has even lower fee. Is it the real bitcoin? Also, lightning transaction is feeless if you have direct channel between payer and payee. Lightning also leads to way lower fee if the number of transaction is huge. Also, if one cares about fee so much, he can use other alts that is way cheaper than bcash.
Lightning is dominated by few hubs, yes, but those cant do anything harmful to the network nor those big hubs can confiscate your coin in lightning. Bitcoin base layer is incredibly decentralised. Meanwhile, bcash base layer is extremely centralized, no one bother to run bcash full node and its development is essentially strangled by a scammer. Remember, some degree of centralization will always occur. Yet, centralization in layer 2 is essentially harmless because it is restricted by the protocol and is punishable by the system. Meanwhile, centralization in the base layer (as in bcash and many alts) can leads to bad acts such as double-spend, censorship, and fraud.
Bcash is extremely illiquid and lacks adoption as well as transaction. Even a meme coin, doge has more volume than bcash. It tells you how the market despise this coin in relative to other coin. Bcash is generally thought by public as a scam coin due to it muh propaganda of anti-bitcoin.
1million bcash is being hold by bitmain. What is going to happen if bitmain went insolvent and try to dump even 1 percent of it?

Tbh I got skeptical about eth although i am financially invested in it. The dev talking about rewriting the code from scratch (creating eth 2.0) really makes me think : wtf is so wrong on the original code that has so much eip already. And yet the dev need to rewrite the whole thing!?
@_date: 2019-04-20 03:15:54
The bear market we had is actually a bliss for the **true believers** to **accumulate**. I first bought BTC at 8k (somewhere in 2017), then at 10k, then at 12k. I watched it reach ATH at 20k, never sell, and then it crushed from there. Since then I consistently bought at 6k whenever I have spare money. 6k at that time was considered a floor price for BTC and it has large buy walls too. It was also lower than my entry cost.
Until the sale of BTC happened at 3k. Man I was worried it may fall further but I'm also so thrilled for my chance to "break even"! At that point, my average BTC cost is about 7k due to cost averaging, so a 3k BTC is a must-grab. I cut down on my expense at ways (no movie, taking public transport, no new sports shoes, no fancy lunch, etc) and live a frugal life. I buy at every chance I have the spare money until I really can't.
At this point my average BTC cost is 5k. Which I'm satisfied with. I still placed the buy orders because I really believe BTC will boom. Because the fundamentals are stronger than ever. Bitcoin full nodes are increasing. LN is working wonder for small transactions. Adoption expanding. Github commits are ever active from the developers. The community is proven to be tied-knitted and damn hard-core supportive (just look at the LN Trust Chain movement and the recent Holdonaut movement). On top of all of these, the next BTC Halvening is imminent (**less than 400 days**). We only have this much left time to accumulate more.

The main developer of Bch (Peter R.) was caught sock-puppeting on Twitter. Makes the community wonders why a developer needs to spend much time on Twitter fudding Bitcoin instead of spending the time to build/improve Bch. Main developer doing the job of a marketer, suggesting Bch is low on personnel? I don't know it could be this.
Or maybe some Bch holder decided to dump just a bit?
@_date: 2019-04-01 05:37:29
Well done buddy. 0.5btc is a great milestone and remember to move a majority of it to a wallet you control instead of leaving all your btc on an exchange. Think Mt.gox back in the day, it is the most popular and most transacted. Nobody think it will collapse within 1 day. Same sentiment to coinbase and binance now too, although it arguably conform to regulations. But when it happen, all btc we hodl on exchange is literally gone.
Good luck and we will see each other at the moon.

BCH is a centralized network, and BTC is on a decentralized network.
A centralized network censor, double-spend and fraud. A decentralized network doesn't.
It is that simple.
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:22:47
Also: bcash and ethereum is extremely centralized.
My decent laptop couldn't even constantly sync up with the eth main chain even with pruning. The ram is constantly full (16gb of ram), cpu always high usage, and very very intensive write to disk. No user can run an eth full node with an average computer. But meanwhile my old laptop run bitcoin core easy and look at how many people just run bitcoin full node on raspi. This is how bitcoin achieve decentralization.
For bch and bsv which adopt the big blocks approach. Nevermind. No one bothers to run a bch node anyway
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:50:19
Actually not too much new buyers. The existing bchers themselves are buying to get some sha256 hash power from bitcoin. Before the pump, 93% of the world sha256 is mining bitcoin and 7% mining bch. Now bch has about 9%.
So you may ask why bch need more hash power? well this is because one of their leaders (Csw) threatened to fuck up the opposing chain upon the fork. Csw allegedly control about 43% hash of bch. Without new hash power he will take over bch easy

Nope, the combined hashrate from jihan and jihan-friendly pool wouldn't even reach 51% of btc hash rate. Hashwar or not, no one is able to 51% btc as of yet.
Bch.abc and bch.sv on the other hand face the  hash rate conflict instead. Both have to defend their own chain after the fork for a prolong period of time until the chains stabilise.
Some sha256 miners (like bitmain), who is supportive of bch but ironically has been mining btc (due to higher profit) has dump btc for usd/fiat because btc transaction will take a longer time to process after the sha256 miners switch to help out bch.abc/bch.sv for awhile.
BTC difficulty adjust every two weeks, during the bch internal hashwar miners will need liquidity to sustain the war. Liquidity will be difficult to come by when the btc difficulty hasnt adjust yet. Therefore they sell prematurely, crashing the btc price to 5.5k
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:23:56

double-spending is extremely profitable when the 51% is easy to carry out and there is profit to be made (when there is sufficient buy volume on exchanges to absorb your maliciously minted coin). this was executed on bitcoin gold previously.
one can foresee the bch forks will very much be susceptible to such attack, especially the following conditions are met:
1) when the nethash of the forked bch is low (attacker spending less resource)
2) when there is market volume to absorb the coin dumped by attackers on exchange (most probably (bitmain/jihan/ver).

the already small bch community got split into 3 (abc, sv, bu) camps. with even thinner support in each camp, the attack from btc miners is way more easier to execute.
the first crack will be on 15th nov: split of bch miners &amp; communities
the eventual burst will be when 2% of current btc miners launch an 51% to all 3 bch forks, one at each time. double-spend, crash the price, rinse&amp; repeat until 0. then bch will be done for good.

I am really enjoying the moment now when bitcoin can be purchased at 3-4k.
Got scammed buying bcash at ath, lucky that I change all to BTC. Since then I am increasing my coin whenever there is spare money to spend, buying in at 9k, then 6k, and now 4k.
Up to this stage my average BTC price is 5.5k. And I would easy make a 200% return when BTC is 11k.
Still I am greedy and selfish and I wish BTC have another year of bear run, allowing strong hands like us to accumulate more. When my average BTC cost is 3.5k, a BTC bullrun towards a mere 7k is already yielding me a 200% return.
Can't wait for another paycheck to come in. Cheers.

check what is the adoption of btc vs bch 1 year from now. it can be price, market cap, hashrate, degree of decentralisation, adoption, tech development, consensus etc. if btc wins, then the sane decision is btc, not bcash.
you may give yourself any time. 2 years etc. but not too long in case bcash becomes zero

by bcasher definition crypto must have big block size in order to be sound money. but too bad bch and bsv has no adoption despite a 128mb block size.
by bcasher definition crypto must have big block size therefore centralisation is good.
sorry but the whitepaper of bitcoin literally state that bitcoin must be decentralised so bcash fundamentally violates Satoshi whitepaper.

What the bcasher don't understand is, the on-chain scaling by raising block size does not solve the problem long-term. As adoption increase, block size need to be raised over and over to keep up. This is fundamentally against the decentralized nature of bitcoin. 
The scaling approach that's sustainable and decentralized will be through the off-chain scaling using payment channels and sidechains.

contrary to what we think BCH's little pump in recent market price is due to people buying in to get free forked coins, the chineses believe the recent pump in BCH is artificially created by Jihan to make bitmain ipo look less terrible, and to get more newcomers to consider having bch in their portfolio.

Quantum computers can pose probable threats to all current cryptographic algorithms, being it SHA256, Keccak or SHA-3 by bruteforcing or by collision attack. The general expectation of quantum computer is it's expected to brute force a given encrypted hash with large number of trials done within a short period of time.
Bitcoin POW is based on SHA256, yes, but Bitcoin is a blockchain network as a whole by, far the most decentralized one, not just a single hash. The entire chain is stored on all bitcoin nodes across the world. All these nodes always follow a chain with most accumulated POW. A bad actor who privately own quantum computers could theoretically fork the network by secretly mine on his own chain to achieve higher accumulated POW, and then publish it to other nodes. This is technically a 51% attack. 51% attack can be dealt with by few measures, such as a blockchain roll back or, community support for the honest chain. A 51% attack on the network will tank the price too. And the attacker may not circumvent his cost by double spending.
Given the game theory, it's almost guarantee that  quantum computers if realised, will be used to mine bitcoin rather than 51% attack the network. This strengthen the network, much like the early emergence of asic mining machines. The first ever creator of bitcoin asic miners theoretically has the power to 51% but he use it to mine instead because it simply profits more. Nevertheless, it certainly leads to centralisation unless the quantum computers are popularised to public.
Another way quantum computer can "kill" bitcoin is by cracking the private key of the richest bitcoin wallet (aka satoshi's wallet). Assuming the attacker obtain satoshi's wallet.dat and proceed to crack his private keys, then millions of BTC will be sold on the market. This can lead to years long bear market. This cannot happen unless the attacker obtain satoshi's wallet.dat file from his computer.

We have less than a year to Bitcoin halvening. Currently the reward of mining a block is 12.5 BTC. Let say the cost (electricity, maintenance, tax, land) to profitably mine 1 BTC is 8k $ now and assuming most seller of BTC in the market is the miners.
After the halvening, only 6.25 BTC is rewarded per block mined. Assuming the cost running the mining operation remain the same, do you think miners will still sell 1 BTC at 8k $? Certainly not and  that will push the BTC price even higher. The 8k $ you spent accumulating BTC now will easily worth more in less than a year. Just have a little patience, accumulate while we can, and we will be rewarded within a year.

It's painful but nevertheless a good lesson as well.
There are mainly two resentful events:
a) buy at ATH, but price proceed to crash.
b) sell at ATL expecting to buy back lower, but price proceed to moon.
I kind of experienced event (a). I only buy but never sell. My friend experienced both. He always talked about how event (b) crushed him, and is always salty about it. Personally I think event (b) is so much more excruciating and punishing than event (a) because when the price is mooning, everyone rejoice and share their excitement, while the lonely one who sold their stack at the lower price range kind of "miss out". It's just too stressful to ride the emotions. Just hodl and it'll be very rewarding in a few years

You earn fee(s) by routing payment(s) in LN. You can set the fee to be high or low but the main objective of running LN is not for earning fee. It's for you to create/receive payments while minimizing on-chain transaction fees and wait time.
The fees that you set to charge is independent to the available balance of your channel. Although it's quite unlikely to make profit by routing payments in LN, it is not entirely impossible. If you have free electricty and free internet, then there will be profit, although a razor thin one (roughly 1-2 sat per payment routed)

Please do not confuse bitcoin (BTC) with many of its fork such as bitcoin cash (BCH) or bitcoin gold (BTG) or Bitcoin satoshi vision (BSV). Bitcoin is BTC and the rest of the forks simply isn't bitcoin. Siimple as that. Just in case you got wrongly manipulated or misled by the malicious BCH marketing, which like to falsely call their forked coin as real bitcoin.
Again, BCH is one of the many forks of BTC but BCH claim it's the real BTC. Which is factually wrong and scammy. As outlined in Whitepaper, the longest chain (chain with highest cumulative difficulty/POW) is the consensus (BTC). BCH is a failed contentious fork that only has 7% of BTC hashrate, illiquid and low adoption. Even doge coin has more transaction than BCH. Can you imagine a fucking meme coin has more transaction than the coin that you looking forward to buy..
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:39:21
Partially correct. Depends on if you view it in a individual basis, or from a consensus perspective.
On an individual basis, a non mining full node help yourself.
On a collective basis, non mining full nodes become consensus. They as a whole reject or accept miners decision. Eg during a fork, miner group A and miner group B mine different block. A non mining full node decides which fork to follow and proceed to validates and propagate. In a decentralized network, non mining full node is perhaps the most important part in determining what is consensus. Miners only follow profits and profits follow userbase (which s reflected by number of non mining nodes).
To put in the economical sense, miners who run full nodes will follow the consensus formed by a majority of non-mining users because those users are the one who buy the coin sold by miners.

This is because the bcashers fud on bitcoin about dying babies and high fees unable to buy a cup of coffee is so so much obsolete. People actually dump bcash after realising it is essentially a scam coin.
A Bcasher doesn't realise that transacting for a cup of coffee is most efficiently processed and done off-chain (lightning). On-chain scaling will and must eventually halt at a point because not many people will be able to run full node for decentralization. It's only via off chain scaling that bitcoin can be adopted by mass. Talking about buying coffee, we'll have off-chain settlement like bakkt/starbucks soon that would crush bcash empty highway by tons of magnitude fold. Lightning will crush bcash 128mb block by light years.
A Bcasher will always claim their coin is bitcoin by arguing their coin is more align to the whitepaper. But the truth is, bcash itself violate the fundamentals of the whitepaper with its Dda and tokenisation of the coin. Wormhole token pushed by jihan? Bcasher only call their coin as bitcoin because of marketing so they can dump their coins. No one would call bch as bitcoin outside of ver influence.
A bcasher is a scammer.
Don't be a bcasher.

Why would I use ETH if it's just another centralized form of money, which is no better than fiat. Decentralisation is achieved by nodes run by mass users who does not need to trust one another except himself. Now ask the cryptoverse who run a ETH full node. Basically none. I run it last time and it used all of the cpu and hdd resources that my computer jam and still finding a hard time to stay in sync.
Node decentralization wise, ETH is a failure. Same goes to development decentralization. Basically doesn't matter pow or pos because at the end it's pov.

He went to jail for frauding people and never change after he was discharged. Honesty and consistency are what he never had and will never have.
He illegally used the hashpower on bitcoin.com that's suppose to mine btc to mine bchabc during the hash war with bchsv. Is this honesty to you?
He claimed miners and hashrate doesn't matter before the hashwar happen with csw (bchsv), propagating that user adoption is more important to bchabc. As a result the paid shills in reddit sub controlled by him (r/btc) sing along. They and Ver inadvertently changed their stand after bchabc win the hashwar against SV, claiming hashrate is important and therefore bchabc is the real bch due to more culminating work was performed (more pow/more hashrate). Ver even tweeted that bchabc enjoyed an ath hashrate. This shows everyone how he change 180 degree before and after the hashwar. Is this consistency to you?

a daily reminder to not use a jihan/bitmain-controlled bitcoin explorer site ([btc.com]( Currently [btc.com]( is showing the latest block mined being 5 hours 08 minutes ago. This is definitely not true and is another scam by jihan, wanting to mislead people yet again.
At this moment the highest block mined is 7minutes ago, as shown in most bitcoin explorer sites (e.g. [ and [ )
It's either a scam by jihan or bitmain is on the brink of bankruptcy that couldn't even maintain a block explorer site as suggested by many chineses in 8btc.

are you one? Bcashers love their jihan, csw and ver trio so much and hail them during the 2017 fork. except to have a fallout after 1 year.
to me this trio is the biggest scammers in crypto sphere.
And you have yet to answer my questions. C'mon don't be a pussy avoiding them.

Just don't buy into any of the bch/bsv/bab shits. Then none of our money will be scammed by jihan ver csw.

You're exactly right on the propaganda aspect. Instead of focusing on tech and adoption, Bcash is all about marketing and propaganda, to the extreme of scamming people to buy their bag deliberately.
They attacked bitcoin (btc) because there's really no way to sell bch without branding it as "real bitcoin". There is no other alts that call themselves "real bitcoin", except these two alts. It's insidious.

Wrong. Staking does not enforce decentralization. In fact, staking encourages centralization and makes centralization even worst. This is proven in all masternode altcoins. 376 wallets in ETH holds as much as one-third of all ether in circulation. Staking and POS makes the already centralized environment even more central.
And, with staking or without, individual users can't run Ethereum full node. It's already wrong at the base layer. So plasma being the second layer can't be decentralized when your base layer itself is centralized.


Don't ball me with Plasma and POS. As I said in my original comment:  **why would I use ETH if it's just another centralized form of money, which is no better than fiat.** First, POS is centralisation. Second, Plasma is built on a centralised network.

Leaving coins on exchanges are only benefitting the shorters and exchanges.
Shorters lend your coins to short the market and the interrest they pay goes to exchanges.
Exchanges earn by transfer fee between fiat-coin or coin-altcoins.
I won't scream too loudly about "not your keys not your coin", but don't just leave all your coins on exchange. It's just advisable to keep a large junk of them in your wallet that's controlled by you, yourself. Rmb mt.gox? Everyone back then has very high confidence in mt.gox. but look what happened

exactly what roger ver and jihan wu wants. they hardforked the original bitcoin chain to create a new coin (BCH) and push so hard in propaganda to confuse people so their heavy bags can be off-loaded.
just be vigilant and dont not buy bch/bchabc/bab/bsv/bchsv.
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:29:05
good one buddy. it seems like bcashers have nothing else to fud that their repetitive lies are so recognizable by both of us.
bcashers screaming about blockstream controlling btc should do both of the following:
\- check out the bitcoin github commits
\- admit bcasher amaury being the sole dev of bchabc, the most centralised bitcoin fork on earth

So basically bch being a centralized coin are very much controlled and dictated by the coin's leaders: jihan, ver, csw.
Ver's camp want to push for a fork with opcodes that enables tokenization (creating wormhole token to earn more money). His coin is bchabc.
Csw disagree with that and push for a fork with different opcodes and large block size. His coin is bchsv.
Jihan verbally support ver but instead go ahead to mine BTC because BTC is more profitable.
On the hash war of ver vs csw, ver illegally divert the hash power on the pool he controlled that's suppose to mine BTC to mine bchabc. So bchabc temporarily won the hash war and won the ticker of bch/bab. Bchsv take the ticker of bsv. As of to date, bsv is closing the gap of pow towards bab, and the market cap of bsv has exceed bab. So it's difficult to say which wins. It's a mega cluster fuck.
No matter what happens, don't got scammed into buying bch/bab/bsv. Those coin owner desperately claiming their coin is the true bitcoin just to unload their bag. It's very centralized and illiquid. Beware and dyor.

Bcash propaganda is the most insidious among all. No one call bchabc and bsv as bitcoin outside of Ver's and CSW's sphere of influence.
