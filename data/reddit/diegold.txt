How you make a private wallet? I'm fairly new and have one linked to coinbase. How i can make one independent?

Someone is really happy today

Mtgox is not the only exchange. As far as money laundering that depends on your country's laws.

From the sidebar
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

don't use coinbase to do little payments.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:37:30
It seems like a scam tbh, makes me wonder if that counter is real then people are real stupid. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:18:21
fair enough
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:06:19
Still to early to tell where it will settle at. It may go up soon.

@_date: 2013-12-07 02:58:45
literally nothing, bitcoin not accepted. Save yourself 54 seconds of your life.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:08:30
Coinbase is $0.20 and i don't think that one is voluntary.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:52:28
Since you're top comment can you do a un-official gold count and edit it in your comment ?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:05:52
Good thing I only have $0.12 on my wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:34:00
It can be someone else, not coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:19:12
