I had problems on localbitcoins with RBC as well. I was only accepting direct deposit and a buyer decided to do a bank transfer from their RBC account to mine instead, insisted it was ok. Well, it wasn't ok because their account had been flagged for suspicious activity in the past which caused my account to be locked as well for a week, which caused me to miss a few pre-authorized bill payments.
RBC ended up refunding the buyer their money as the buyer claimed they did not authorize the transaction, which I feel is total BS and the person was gaming the system. Only after providing the bank with the name on the other RBC account did they unlock my account. I only lost about 0.14 BTC in the transaction, but it has made me realize that localbitcoins is not a trustworthy system.  
  
Just because you say you want one form of payment doesn't stop the buyer from using another, which could cause your account to get locked, whether you sent them bitcoins or not, if the buyers account was previously flagged.  
  
I since went to Vault of Satoshi and have had nothing but good experiences.

This right here is the kicker. You can only deduct that if you own a business, something most casual miners don't have.

Its an exchange, more like btc-e or CavirTex, cryptsy, etc. They have fiat to crypto exchange across multiple currencies including BTC, LTC, Doge, VTC, etc.

I received this email last night as well. Knew right away it wasn't legit as I haven't been dealing with any Bitcoins in years, nor with anyone named Alan!
