If traders stop trading and exchanges stop their working (nearly impossible) then still there will be price for bitcoin. There is some use case of bitcoin. People around the world are using bitcoin for their payments so practically it is impossible to go for something like Zero or 50 dollar. We need to get exact data of how many bitcoins are used daily for payment purposes as it will define rate of bitcoin. Lot of people are hodlere of bitcoin and they are long term investors like me. I m paying with bitcoin so i need to purchase them for making payments as well as holding few for long term. If there is another drastic collapse of price, there will be another massive bounce in price. Bitcoin is having low fees when you are getting paid or paying for something, making it a thing to stay for a longer period of time.

Bitcoin is useful and it can be proved with the amount of bitcoin used in daily transaction across web from dark web to clean web. It is cost effective and it is decentralised. It will be there and with the passage of time govt agencies will start accepting that it isn’t avoidable.

190k in value but still holding. Btc and several other alts purchased at 18k , 15k , 12k , 9k , 7k , 6k btc price ... assuming it is base price and will not go down after that ... still accumulating in a hope that it will go back covering all losses no matter in a year or two ....

Low transaction cost as compared to paypal and other gateways which is one of the reason for increased demand
Privacy is the second reason, you can send and receive payment anonymously.
Centralized , not a single controlling body which result in more confidence over systems run by organisations. Such as paypal &amp; skeill, they usually suspend account without giving access to funds. I personally lost hundreds of dollars in these gateways.

Correct answer with surety could only be.
1 BTC = 1  BTC 
If anyone else gives answer other than this , it could be a guess nothing else. I personally think it could be somewhere in between 1k to 100k , it can’t be more , it could be less....

Contact support of blockchain and they will give you way to unhide private keys and then recover funds

More than paypal, skrill , credit card etc .... I am talking about comparative study among online other usual payment gateways...

There is no solid reason behind this bull run so I m expecting a sharp downfall...

Rise without consolidation is dangerous. It is healthy for market. Chances of sudden crash reduce down when we see this type of market behavior as weak hands move out at every step and only strong hands make another floor for going higher.
