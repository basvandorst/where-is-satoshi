More like borrowed terms from video games.

I don't think Pham is competent enough to moderate that tho. He's just a social media guy.

Or, like, did they do something specific recently?

You get what I mean: for a specific price, there's more sellers than buyers.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:50:19

Different people have different limit prices set.
Fewer buyers than sellers for a specific limit price results in a liquidation of the order book for that specific limit price.
Then onto the next (lower) price.

yet if it's going down, there's more people selling than buying
@_date: 2018-06-27 23:33:01

Yeah, as far as I'm concerned, I want this thing to succeed, as it will bring a shit ton of new people into crypto.

Plus, Libra is a tradeable token, which means more money going into bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:24:08
Libra is pegged to USD, EUR, GBP, YEN.
