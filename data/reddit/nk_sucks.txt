Market manipulation by major investors. Be wary.
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:09:38
This is market manipulation in its purest form. The majority of small speculators will pay for the gains of a few whales. Suckers.
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:02:15
Same shit we heard in November.
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:13:38
Because it was all hype.

These are not the secrets to life at all. Just some bullshit. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:27:10
the measure you specified is meaningless. what matters is purchasing power back then.
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:32:22
your comment, that is.
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:02:27


@_date: 2015-01-31 18:45:51
fuck, you still don't get it. inflation is always factored into price changes that still happen due to changes in supply and demand. i'll explain it like this: yes, your dollars are less valuable now than back then but there are also way more of them today, so many more that you're still richer overall. maybe you'll get it now. i doubt it though.
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:05:19
it makes perfect sense, you're just really dumb, sorry to break it to you.
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:58:48
itt: clueless, stupid people. inflation is necessary for a healthy economy to work. cost of living is lower now than at any other time in human history. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:12:47
doesn't matter.
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:32:02
except the price of silver is not a constant. people like you need to stop obsessing about silver and gold and focus on what the actual living standard was back then.
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:21:12
30$ an hour is total bullshit, what matters is what you could actually buy with 1,50$ back then, not the silver price in 2012. sheesh... 
also, basic necessities like food were much, much more expensive. people used to spend around 50% of their income on food, today it's more like 10%.
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:28:19
lol, yeah. not surprised that so many clueless idiots hang out on r/bitcoin but still...
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:03:43
this has nothing to do with inflation and everything to do with a broken tax code (Tax rates for the 1% are obscenely low) and crony capitalism.
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:31:55


please stop. this is just embarrassing. ever heard of supply and demand? *this* is what leads to changes in price. shit, you're utterly clueless yet convinced you have a clue. lol...
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:54:38
simple psychology will do the trick. people get nervous after a while. you'll see.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:23:45
have you looked at the graph lately? there was a bubble forming in late october and it's not over yet. the price will come down substantially, question is when.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:04:16
yeah, but a crash is coming of course. that's for sure. so like i said, i'd like your best guess when it might happen and possible triggers.
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:14:24
The market is completely overheated. There is another crash coming, a big one.
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:19:43
Strong indication of a bubble/crash. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:15:17
very funny
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:00:16
brace for a crash.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:30:30
it will. human psychology makes it inevitable. people panic.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:59:52
the question is why not? bubbles always burst and this is one.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:29:43
ITT: A lot of delusional Bitcoin freaks who are about to get a dose of reality.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:24:35
we'll see.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:06:50
so, the price fell 14% today - has the crash started?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:02:51
it's the opposite. he is pretty bad at writing fiction but right on bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:20:31
it always amazes me how people think the current trendline will continue for much longer just because that's what they want to happen. a crash/significant correction is inevitable. atm this is pure speculation, i.e. a bubble. ofc the price will rise again but not that fast. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:54:36
it's not.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:20:34
the plan is to let spacex and other companies ferry astronauts to the station. there is no moon program anymore (and that's a good thing, constellation was a disaster, years behind schedule and way over budget).
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:23:32
But once you have deposited some money into your account you can buy and sell bitcoins almost instantaneously, no? Let's say i have 1000 dollars in my btc-e account. i buy a bitcoin, go over to mtgox and sell it there. what do i care if it takes weeks to get my money out from gox then?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:36:11
i still don't get what the problem is. what matters is that you can once you have funds of fiat currency available online you can trade bitcoins instantaneously. what does it matter if it takes half a year to cash out as long as you get the money in the end?
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:17:39

@_date: 2013-11-20 16:31:30
watching this bubble pop is fun.
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:04:21
Ofc it's a bubble. Simple psychology makes a crash inevitable.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:19:27
this is gonna crash so hard. it will be real ugly.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:39:12
so what you're saying is it's possible after all:)
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:36:24
And will lose almost all of it before long, again. This is a bubble if there ever was one.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:32:35
it basically works like this: people start anticipating the crash, get nervous and start to sell off their coins to cash in before they start losing in value. once there is a critical mass of people doing that and the price starts to drop significantly people get even more panicky and a lot more start to sell their coins which leads to ever steeper and faster price drops. it's self-reinforcing.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:35:52
i lol'd. but then i serious'd.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:31:03
well, it would be annoying for sure but still, like this you can make money in a relatively safe, predictable way it seems to me. like i said, what do i care if it takes months for the money to get into my bank account? the important thing is that you can trade bitcoins instantaneously if you already have funds of 'real money' available. is that correct?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:39:39
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:43:35
bitcoin rapidly approaching the end of the current bubble/another crash.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:03:34
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:14:58
because it always does.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:56:42
i'm thinking below $100...
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:58:39
in the short term you'll definitely lose money. in the long-term, not so much.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:36:36
what does it matter if it takes a long time until you get your money as long as you get it eventually?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:26:03
The opposite is correct: panic sell by all means, it's the only way to cut your losses.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:10:20
it's a bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:15:35
less than 100$
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:58:28
i have no doubt that the price will continue to rise in the longterm but a shortterm crash is almost certainly coming as a sufficient number of people get nervous and start to sell.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:21:32
no, it could not. reality is about to teach you a lesson.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:52:12
i want to buy some bitcoins after the next crash, then sit on it for years to come.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:44:17
i'm optimistic that it will go back up. just don't want to buy before the inevitable short-term crash. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:22:28
A correction is coming, a big one. In other words a crash. I pity the suckers who buy now..
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:57:30
very soon i think.
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:53:56
ofc it is. the price is rising way too fast. people will start to cash in before long. speculation is what's fueling this rally.
in the longterm though i agree with you.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:52:28
Too bad he is a horrible writer. Some interesting ideas in his books though.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:20:48
only for the next couple of years.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:15:58
ares v was cancelled.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:59:25
i'd rather wait than buy now and curse myself when the crash happens.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:42:44
you're not late. prices will come down soon, this is a bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:26:57
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:14:56
well, shit.
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:55:08
i'm hoping well below 200.
