Red is definitely BCH. BCH rose and dropped the hardest percentage-wise. Also, Coinbase and BCH basically started the drama that lead to  these dips.

It disappeared faster than I thought it would. What happened? Did people buy or did the whale cancel the sell order? I looked away for a few minutes and it was gone.

Nope. See that yellow wall that they crashed into? That's the buy wall. The cryptocurrencies will be back up. Just be patient.

Liked by Casey Neistat? Is no one gonna mention that? I didn't know he even knows about bitcoin. But then again, I haven't followed his content recently. It would be cool if he talks about bitcoin to his audience.

I'm very curious how much he's made in tips. 
He put his address in the video description. Some people that thought he was funny might have tipped what they thought was little amount. But that was 2015. A little amount in 2015 would be YUGE now.

I think only your biological age changes, which means only your body will revert or fast forward in age, not the world around you. In any case, I would gladly go back to being 10 years old.
