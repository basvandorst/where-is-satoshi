My first BTC purchase was a little over a month ago when it was at $500. It only took two weeks for me to see a 30% return. I wasn't locked in, there wasn't a a minimum purchase requirement, and I could get out (sell) at any time. 
Had I invested it in CDs though my bank, which is safe and federally insured, it would have taken me five years to earn 2%, with a $1,000 min deposit.
Some people are investing thinking they will become rich. I'm sure you can, but it's not going to happen investing $20-$100. Those days are gone. I do however t hink we'll continue to see 15% - 30% returns for the next couple of years. 
Buying right now makes perfect since if you believe the price will be back up within a few months (I'm betting it will be back up within a matter of weeks). If you don't think they will go back up within 3-6 months. Don't invest. And if you can't afford to lose everything. Don't invest.

My family and I like Coinbase. It's a US company based out of California and investors poured over 25 million into the company very recently. They have trust and they are pretty easy to use. You have to link you checking account, just like you would if you opened a PayPal account. It takes about five days to setup the account. Then once they buy coins, it takes another five days for the coins to become available to spend. That time delay is a real pain, but it's easy and safe.

I've been waiting for about a month. Actually I completely forgot until I read your post. I checked right now and I notice they updated the time frame from 5-10 days to 20 days. Even though I've been waiting longer then that, I assume they must be really backed up. Haven't bothered to contact their support, been buying low on Coinbase. I know it's not the same, but I'm not day trading.

I started buying like crazy when it dropped to $700 on Coinbase.

Anytime it hits $1,000 people sell off like crazy. At $700-$800 people buy as much as they can afford. The $900 mark seems to be where most people will hold or spend like cash. 
That's my 2 cents anyway.

I never heard of Fancy before. Looks like they sell a lot of chick stuff, which is interesting because the polls I've been reading indicate bitcoin owners tend to be males with above average income. Just more evidence bitcoin is going mainstream.

Until I can buy guns, drugs, and sex with Bitcoins locally, I will keep the majority of my money in US Dollars. My "investment" in Bitcoins is pretty low. I invest just because Bitcoins are interesting and I want to learn more about how it works. Anytime I see a 30% or higher return I cashed out.

This is great. I hope other dealers follow suite. Often times when I order firearms online through sites like Gun Broker, the only accepted form on payment is a money order. I've had to wait 2-3 weeks just to get my arms shipped to my local FLL, because the gun dealer has to wait for the funds to clear before shipping. 
In this case, paying in bitcoins is both cheaper and faster. Yeah I'd have to still pay DROS and dealer fees in person, but then I can pay cash.

I like the idea of the Pi Wallet, but the current version looks way to big and ugly. 
Reminds me of those cheap .99 cent ethernet jack testers you see on Amazon that ship direct from china. Again, very cool idea, but eeek, it's just so uuuuuugly. Sorry mang. Me no buy.
