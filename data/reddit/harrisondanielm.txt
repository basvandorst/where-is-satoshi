Just because something is being tested doesn't mean it's "having a hard time ... bear[ing] the weight of its ambitions". In fact, the more I consider this statement, the more stupid it sounds: of course when you "test" something you put it under strain - that is the entire POINT of testing. I reverse any previous goodwill I may have allowed this moron - it's hype and the guy is just fibbing to big his own product up. This is PR nonsense, disregard.
(Although one can infer from this the quality of Counterparty's technology is obviously not what it is made out to be if this sort of rep is even unclear about empirical testing methodologies!)

I think you missed the point. The issues people are taking up with this guy are way beyond the basics of counterparty risk ...
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:23:32
I don't really think the guy did say that Bitcoin "beats out competitors" - he just said that the market for new Blockchains, other than Ripple and Ethereum, was getting tougher and tougher to enter. Where on earth did this "bitcoin is all there is" line get read into this?

Can you post a link to the announcement that Second Market is listing its bitcoin ETF on OTCBB? Cheers!

I am really pleased to see that there is demand for this kind of content - stuff about crypto and bitcoin and tech etc. which is longer, more encompassing and much broader in scope. This makes me think I will do a few more pieces like this one. Any other areas of interest anyone has in tech for a piece like this, which is more socially-/financially-/politically- contextualized while still remaining focused on the tech subject ... if there's anything you would "definitely read anything about" (ie have that sort of enthusiasm for) I would love to hear from you guys on ideas ...

Thats like asking, is it a good idea to eat food just to stay alive - and so if that is the case then just to stick to anything that works, mayeb even junk food? It smacks of ulterior motive and doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense ... (but could make tremendous difference to the longevity of the lifetime involved ...)

Awesome - really glad it worked for you too, thanks!

A Simple Primer (Explanation) For MARKETS, MECHANISMS &amp; MEDIA.
You can read the paper here: 
In economies of industrial scale, a company traditionally does this:
It Brands Itself (Spreads) x It Scales (Serves incoming flood of customers) / Streamlines Ops
It has to Streamline its ops - i.e. cut back a little on the push-push-push of the sales dudes hawking the brand and cool stuff on offer - because of the flood of customers coming in via branding so Streamline is represented as a divide in the operating process (it might also be the other way round at some points, too). This is a Market Mechanism company. Any company works like this that is traditional - an automaker, a supermarket, you name it.
Now, recently companies such as Google, YouTube and others instead have does this instead:
They Streamline Ops (via their) x Branding (meaning they bang everything in one virtual place for you and serve it from one hub effficiently - as opposed to say, Coke, which has to get the mix of ingredients from supplier, get the bottle etc etc) 
This means that the process whereby a customer is served (scale) becomes a more or less functional non-interpersonal one (so it is the divider this time, cutting back the interpersonality of the service which is inherently efficiency-driven). This way it can learn lots about your habits and target you accordingly! THIS IS DISRUPTIVE TO MARKET MECHANISM. This is a "Market Divider" where the market is being affected in an unusual sense (ie not being treated to personal interaction as is traditionally the case etc.)
Other companies, such as the case of budget airlines for example:
Scale x Spread (meaning they go anywhere and everywhere in an untargeted fashion after the lowest common denominator of customer which no one wants - traditionally) 
They get the same customers as Google does and because  of the flurry of customers they, just like traditional companies, have to REALLY Streamline ops (ever seen how tightly run a budget airline is?! That's because of this!) THIS PROCESS IS DISRUPTIVE TO MARKET MECHANISM COMPANIES This is a "Medium Multiplier" where the medium is acting in an unusually aggressive fashion for such a company.
Now, here is the interesting part - the reason this disruption is happening is because the market mechanism is not very efficient so these disruptions are trying to address this inefficiency. But by addressing the inefficiency they create another inefficiency. Look, if I write:
(3x4)/2=6 this is equally as inefficient as writing (4/2)x3=6
Why not just write: 3x2=6?
Same deal for market mechanisms and all the disruptions - their math contains both multiplication and division (as defined above) no matter what. Except, in the last 5 years some exceptions to this:
Take BuzzFeed. This company:
Scale x Spread x Streamline
which is to say it goes to a market of readers - but not a market of customers; readers are their customers' customers - and broadcasts the messages of its customers (spread x streamline) via its unique independent voice.  From these customers (advertisers) it picks up the money it earns by sacrificing the former cultural independence a competitor of its own (such as any newspaper) maintains it has from its advertisers! Why is this different from advertising? Because it's independent - like a newspaper, and the independence translates as endorsement. Why does this work? Because the contemporary culture has shifted as a result of the technological integration of the marketing process into everyday life that is now a part of global media (i.e. everyone knows that nothing is TRULY INDEPENDENT any more inasmuch as it is impossible to be truly independent in a world where the message is part of an INTEGRATED platform). What is happening here is that because this is a holistically multiplier-integrated model is that BuzzFeed is using the independence of its medium as a news outlet to charge much higher fees to its customers while entertaining their customers with its - ostensibly independent (via the medium; publishing) - content. THIS IS A SELF-SUFFICIENT MODEL. We call these companies X companies (because they are multipliers of market mechanics and because when plotted on the chart in the paper they look like an X).
... or.... there is the Block Chain group of companies (think of Coinbase):
because their customer acquisition and service process (scale) is integrated so tightly into the medium (spread) that its operations are automatically dealt with (streamlined) via the fact that lots of the traditional customer files that are usually filled in, or phones that are have to be answered, and complaints about missing money etc redirected is simply unnecessary (streamlined already as part of the technology's service provision). THIS TOO IS A SELF-SUFFICIENT MODEL. We call these companies Y companies (because they look like a Y when plotted on the picture I put in the article).
The basic tenant of the theory is that by around 2050 there will ONLY be X or Y companies, not the other lot mentioned in this article, which means airlines will have to address their customers needs and the needs of other parties who they engage with (maybe for instance the needs of their suppliers by helping Starbucks with promotions etc on board flights with free coffees they pay for) or that banks will have to adopt an integrated technology such as the block chain.
I really appreciate you taking the time to follow and read this - many thanks!

You got it! Uber is indeed a Y company. This is why it's getting so much agro from people since it is addressing the most ancient of industries! Taxi driving is in essence the rawest kinda Market Mechanism job there is (a bit like prostitution except you have a vehicle). A logical extension of course of Y companies is one day one will indeed serve prostitutes, when the medium can be refined to look like Paris Hilton ... Thanks for engaging! I am glad this is getting clearer. And well spotted!
It's interesting to think about the evolution of Y companies: right now, if there were to be non-human drivers invented, Uber's biz model would be about the only one ready to harness this. That's where it's headed. Basically, if the business model looks like it can be only be enhanced by more of the medium (technology) that's a good sign of a Y company. If the business model looks like it can only be enhanced by more potential mechanisms (competitors, partners, players etc.) that's a good sign it's an X company.

Sure - right now companies provide a mix of the following:
1. Customized Service
2. Production Efficiency
which is fine, but not great. It means your iPhone costs a heck of a lot of money even though there are tons around and you get great service if you pay for it but even that service makes no time guarantees (only how tailored they can make the service to your liking - if that includes time efficiency then that will be an even more expensive component. Try getting everyone to be nice to you and quick! Think of McDonalds ...)
But with the evolution of companies as they are undergoing the service of their markets, the next era will have companies that are either:
1. Customized production (with the efficiency, obviously, since they have that today already) - these are "X" companies since they are multiplying the scale factor
2. Service efficiency - these are "Y" companies since they are slicing into the factors
Basically, you'll have customized production (X) and service efficiency (Y). BuzzFeed offers its advertisers X while Uber offers its customers Y.

It's funny because we had  a ton of traffic over at Medium today on Bitcoin, too, and it seems to have been increasing. The traffic was related to another Reddit:

A lot less weird that it sounds. I have written a long feature article about the history and evolution of Bitcoin here:  and also have a presentation in Bangkok and the Philippines the past month with a c. $2500 (conservative) price projection - the presentation can be obtained here:  There are many detailed calculations in it so if you need help just shoot me an e mail

Thanks - I really appreciate it! Yeah, it's a long piece as I didn't want to shrug off anything as some do when trying to understand and contextualise Bitcoin's place in the economy today and going forward. To do that right, I felt that it was important here to take in the whole scope of the political, social and historical context of money and value, and in turn, arrive at where Bitcoin fits into that jigsaw. Thanks again for reading!

I am the editor of CoinSpeaker. E-Mail me at dmh and I will be happy to talk to you about what can be done - with your permission I would like to talk to the bank and ask them why payment for journalism - free speech - is being restricted/prevented. This is a very serious issue and I would be more than happy to get on top of it with you/for you.
