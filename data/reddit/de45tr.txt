Gas is for contracts.  Entirely different thing than just exchanging Eth which is still cheap as dirt.  Apples to apples for honesty my friend.

Don't let the truth trigger you friend.  Learn to anticipate some people being honest.

Not if the transactions per second can't VASTLY be improved and rapidly.  No one wants a dead currency.

Explain a use case that's different from what I described.  You can't use Lightning for ordinary transactions.  You'd have to already have money in some payment channel and they aren't going to be left open indefinitely.  
If you make a single lightning transaction and close the payment channel, it's just as expensive as an on-chain transaction.

By 5189 Ethereum, will have about 103 million coins.  Don't spread falsehoods.

Risks are exactly the same for both chains.  Luke is not being honest here.  
Coinbase and other exchanges will have to call the new UASF chain "Bitcoin-UASF" and the unchanged chain Bitcoin.  It certainly wouldn't be correct to call the chain that changed "bitcoin" as it's a clear deviation from what bitcoin is right now.

Loss of market share tells us bitcoin is extremely unhealthy.  Ethereum is about to go over 50% of bitcoin market cap alone. 
The only people using Lightning will be businesses that transact frequently.  Individuals are left holding the bitcoin bag here paying high fees.  You won't be paying for your coffee with lightning--ever.  
The only hope is a sidechain that allows for a ton of scaling.

No business is going to open a channel just for you.   Look, if this worked the way you think it does, it would already be working for LiteCoin.

Keep telling folks that and in less than a month, bitcoin will no longer be king.  Ethereum can do sidechains too.

Hey, don't get me wrong.  I'm laughing all the way to the bank.  Ethereum is doing GREAT.  I think in about 10 days we'll be 75% market share of bitcoin.    
Hope you diversified or boohoo for you.  Oh, yeah...Ethereum can do sidechains too.

No, Ethereum has much more capacity to grow.  Bitcoin doesn't.  Ethereum also has momentum and momentum is far more important than who has been hanging around longer.

Bitcoin just had more volume per 24 hours that bitcoin.  You don't know what you're talkign about.

Businesses have to balance their budgets.  They can't hold them open for you forever.  In fact, they will never open one for you in the first place.


You won't be able to unless you're a business making a ton of transactions with other businesses.  
Notice no one is using it with LiteCoin now.
