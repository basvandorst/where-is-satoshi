The US dollar bill has been up and functional 100% of the time since 1792 with not even one single second of widespread downtime.

and the time someone sent themselves 184 billion bitcoin and they threw out 50 blocks.

Who cares? that is like saying bitcoin didn't have total uptime because coinbase went down.

Bitcoin really went the wrong path when 'miners" and "users" split into two groups. The original idea was a p2p system and that was a much more interesting system.

Isn't that a chance to show it's extrinsic value?

well wordpress and the humble bundle both removed it so it's also in good company of "things that drop bitcoin support"

What about the time someone hacked themselves 182 billion bitcoin and the blockchain was reversed an entire day?

It used to be 1235 a coin so to a lot of people 235 seems extremely dead. To people that got in in 2011 that bought at 2.35 it seems good, but very few bitcoin were sold at that price.

visa having downtime would effect the average bitcoin user more than bitcoin having downtime though, bitcoin just isn't that important.

None of this is bugs, bitfinex is run the way that it is run because the owners make money off this stuff. There is specific reasons why this stuff had to be made illegal: people don't just not do it because their hearts are so nice. Even when it's illegal it still happens, so an exchange where no one is even checking? Of course they are going to mess with customer's money in any way they can.

Buying assets when they are down over 99.2% is definitely a sure fire way to get rich for sure!!!!

This seems like a really serious and scary disaster scenario for bitcoin, why is this being treated like it's a good thing bitcoin would help with?

I mean that seems like a comically dumb loophole where every service could have 100% uptime by serving a broken page of a butt or something if you just count anything as uptime even if the thing is totally nonfunctional.

eating at any of those places will give you gas for sure

You have not sent bitcoin through SMS, you have told a centralized system that controls your keys to send some of the money they hold to someone else. That can be done without bitcoin.
