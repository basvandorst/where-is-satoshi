I have post that have broken the  positioning of this sub before. I know post like these will be downvoted initially, but I make them so 6 months from now when it's confirmed I can repost it then get to the top. Like bitcoin, I make my post for the long haul. And for every 10 doubters there's 1 person who listens and buys, which is good enough for me. Not everyone should be smart enough to buy early, after all we need more pizza guys to laugh at later. I'm an approved submitter of this sub for a reason.

I was saying buy from 3.3k all the way up to 10k, then I advised caution. Now I'm advising anytime before 16k. The sub 10k point 3 days ago though was a golden opportunity. But in the long run, every-time is buying while it's low
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:42:18
Guess that's why I had an order in for 11 more coins at sub 10k prices huh? Yeah definitely didn't see it coming hence why I had the orders in. Got another order for 20 at 7k and another order for 50 at 2.5k. Their always a possibility, I just said it was unlikely. Though after this confirmation it makes it more of a possibility

Post like the one I made here are just so people get their foot in the door. Best way to get someone to become an investor is to get them to put even a small amount at a good time.

Yup, this guy obviously hasn't been in long enough. Because I've been in this space for nearly 9 years, and bitcoin is always the first big mover, then it goes flat, then it's alt season. Rinse wash repeat. Don't get me wrong my bags are 80% bitcoin 20% alts, and I keep it that way anytime my alts run up and catch above that ratio. But alts, at least the good ones will always have their season after bitcoin runs flat. It's just how the markets go. So don't go selling all your alts just because this post makes you think they won't, because they will, and you'll just be kicking yourself for having moved your portfolio just out of the next alt wave season. Patience is a virtue.

So if Trump is involved should he pay? Because the evidence is pretty damning. Just because he paid off his accuser does not mean it didn't happen. He's a part of it and your denying all the evidence because you love Trump so much. The hypocrisy is outstanding. Your blaming the left when the left says take them all down, meanwhile you on the right ignore all the evidence and trust whatever Trump says, even though he has been proven to be lying time and time again. How can you not see this? How can one be so delusional?

I started off with a joke comment, then they attacked the joke with an attempt at a serious attack at it, I replied to their serious attack with legit point disproving it. Point is by first comment was a joke, the rest they brought on. I knew I'd get downvoted for it, but I do it anyway whenever the opportunity arises. Makes for fun comments to reply to later down the line when the price is past new highs. Just imagine having arguments from bitcoin back in the 10 or 100 dollar days with naysayers and replying to them now. It's the best experience to go back to these people and remind them about how blind they were.

@_date: 2019-08-27 22:03:59
It's the current rules they have for their mortgages. Hopefully it's written out that in the event of a default only what is owed is taken out of his collateral. Guess their trying to calculate for market fluctuation. Still big news though. If the contract was written out correctly I'd do the deal. Cause then worst case scenario I only lose half my stash and keep the other half and the house. Cause them only taking the owed amount out of what is put up is the only way I'd do the deal myself

Come the early 2020's well probably be aiming .01 btc, then .0028 btc by the mid 2020's. I love where this is going. Welcome to the new 1% club from an old 1%er my new friends! Hold tight!

Also tax reasons. cause u/Mark_Bear if he sold the coins for the house he'd have to pay capital gains on the sold coins and property taxes. This way he never sold the coins because they remain in a 3rd party crypto custody service holding them for the loaning party and him. Since they are not sold he doesn't have to pay capital gains taxes on the coins saving him huge amounts on whatever percentage capital gains are in the country he is in by selling 1.2 million worth of btc for who knows how much of a profit.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:27:18
8 years of profiting in this market. Even if we dip to 2k I'll continue to buy. I bought at 30$, and continued to buy at 2 dollars, I bough at 1000, and continued to buy all the way down to 200. I'll never stop buying. Yes I take profits every once in a blue moon, but that's only when certain benchmarks are hit. Like the first time I broke 1 mil, took 100k in profits and injected it back in on the dip. Same when I broke 5 mil. Next profit I'll take is when I break 10m. Which isn't too far away with the halving coming next year. Personally I'd love a huge dip like 2k, but it is very unlikely  with bakkt and fidelity coming in this summer
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:06:39
Actually, this deal creates a tax benefit because the coins are never sold but only held as collateral. So he saves himself from capital gains taxes he would've had to pay had he sold coins to make the purchase instead of having them kept unsold. Only taxes he'd have to pay is on the property but non on the crypto put up as collateral held by a 3rd party crypto custody service.
@_date: 2019-06-07 15:16:55
Idk if I believe it or not, but it's fun to imagine. It is weird though that they predicted every price accurately since 2014 though. We'll see if they're right again and we hit 100k this year.

All the fiat currency in the world in value that can flow behind bitcoin via fiat value. If you include derivatives then it's actually 2.5 quintillion in value. So it bitcoin or crypto ever becomes tradable for derivatives like stocks, ect, then the max price of 1 bitcoin could pass 100 million per coin in value. Google all the money in the world and you'll find the infographic of this shown in scale with a physical image representation

Yeah yeah, 3 million coins are forever lost, 17 million are only currently in existence, yada yada yada. Calculating it by 21 million just makes it easier for everyone to get. But yes, the prices would be much higher if the current supply were calculated instead of the max supply of bitcoins.

Because when the stock market begins to shake like it is now, those millionaires will be looking to move their wealth like what happened during the great depression when all the wealthy were selling stocks and buying gold.

Yeah, adoption is still early on though. Billions who have never experienced it, billions of people who if introduced at the right time, will become long term holders instead of short term haters because they played themselves. To those coming in, history will mean nothing if they burn themselves. I've been getting friends in for 8 years now, and only those who've listened and come in at the right time are still long term holders. The rest are still in, though they're fickle and scared panic selling all the time. Though they have profited, they could be 100* had they never panic sold losing their positions over and over again.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:14:21
It would because the current amount of coins in existence is 17 million. I just went with 21 million because it's easier for people to comprehend. If the price were calculated by the 3 million lost coins that are inaccessible too, the price would be much higher.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:10:36
The difference here is Bitcoin does bring significant competition. In just it's 10 years of life no other investment in history has come close to bringing in these kind of returns. Not even the internet boom that was the raining investment champion until bitcoin came along. Plus with the stock market failure happening for this whole year, crypto is looking more and more attractive to investors every day. Shit my richest buddy I know with 100 million in assets who I thought would never get in this space has started coming into it too. And if it can get that old farts attention, then it can get anyones at this point of it's track record.

It's very likely now thanks to backed and fidelity opening their own exchanges. Stocks are already traded for other stocks everyday, so with btc being embraced by the owners of these 260 trillion dollar markets, it's only a matter of time before they make btc directly tradable for stocks. Then we have everything in place for the 10 million dollar day. Though I suspect well have to get btc past a million till that's allowed to happen, but that's all only a matter of time now.

Because emojis are used more by young people. And currently for android users if you want to have ₿ you need to program a shortcut into your keyboard. Not something the wide market knows how to do. Making it easier to find makes it easier to use. Like credit cards. If it wasn't so easy for everyone to apply for and use then no one would be using them. Not a direct translation to this, but make it easier to use and the more prominent it's use will become. Otherwise only us who know how to use the keyboard programmable shortcut and the rare few who have the symbol ₿ will be using it.

Yeah, still better to get people in at the right time than to let them fomo in at the wrong time. Otherwise they just get burned and panic sell cementing their losses with a bad view at crypto. At least until years later when they see they would have still profited eventually had they just held.

Make you feel better there big guy? Hopefully your life gets better one day where you don't feel the need to try and tear others down to make yourself feel better.

NYSE are the asset managers. They can't manage the same stock as Fidelity. It would be the equivalent of saying you have the same bitcoin on binance and coinbase. So yeah, grow a brain or gtfo
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:10:00
Why does it show bitcoin core under the btc price chart? If I buy am I getting btcc, or btc? Because if it's btcc I'd be pissed as fuck for paying such a premium on a coin only worth 28 cents a coin.

They also have influence over emojis. Pushing them further could get us emojis too instead of just the emoticon of "₿" that we have now.
Here's  a link to the proposal submission page for emojis to further this Campaigns attempts:

That would explain me and friends seeing someone who looks like me stalking myself and them all my life. Can't even count how many times on 1 hand that a friend calls me or texting me asking what I'm doing watching them on the street while I'm at home having no clue what they're talking about.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:24:12
Exactly. I feel bad for the people that don't comprehend this today. They will be missing out on a huge opportunity because of their lack of understanding.
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:34:19
Not the same as an emoticon, that is a key stroke added that requires users to make shortcuts to use it and only a few who have phones with it built it. Very small market compared to emojis in use basis. ₿=Not Emoji
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:37:34
We need confirmation! If were able to ask for pay in bitcoin for contracts then this can be huge!

You on a computer or phone? If you on a computer the old site wont show it. The new redesign will but who even uses the redesign? Lol
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:32:30
Because emojis are used more by young people. And currently for android users if you want to have ₿ you need to program a shortcut into your keyboard. Not something the wide market knows how to do. Making it easier to find makes it easier to use. Like credit cards. If it wasn't so easy for everyone to apply for and use then no one would be using them. Not a direct translation to this, but make it easier to use and the more prominent it's use will become. Otherwise only us who know how to use the keyboard programmable shortcut and the rare few who have the symbol ₿ will be using it. And there are emojis for other currencies too as well as other emojis that aren't emotions like: ����⚾️����⚽️������������������������**����������**(should I continue?), so hence the excuse that they are just for emojis is incorrect

I never made a prediction, just explained the math behind a 1 million dollar coin, and a 10 million dollar coin, explaining why it's possible and why analyst are speaking of it. If you're to dimwitted to understand that [21 trillion in value/21 million bitcoins= a 1 million]( dollar bitcoin, or [that 260 trillion in value/ 21 million bitcoins = a 12 million dollar coin]( then that's on you. Maybe get a calculator and plug in the numbers so it can do the math for yourself.(I wen't ahead and linked the calculator with the numbers plugged in for you)
&amp; if you're quarrel is that it is very unlikely bitcoin gets used to buy the entirety of the global stock markets to absorb the current 260 trillion in stocks and derivatives, then you are not accounting for the fact that the 260 trillion will continue to grow, and by 2030 is projected to be over 800 trillion in value, making 260 trillion a little under 1/3rd of what the market will be at the time. An easy grab for something like bitcoin.  
So yes, please understand how the math works as you arguing against calculated results which you can simply plug into a calculator to verify yourself, that is making you look foolish. You're essentially arguing with me right now that 2+2 does not equal 4.

Don't worry, they all want to be your friend after your bitcoin buys you your first Yacht. Never seen them all want to go into bitcoin and stop calling me just lucky like during this downturn though
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:35:24
There is still very few who know about it and even fewer who understand it. The point here is those who aren't in yet are learning enough to not let the dips scare them from entry. This could mean more stabilization and less dramatic dips. Could mean nothing too, but people being not afraid to come in during dips is a good stabilization sign in terms of dramatic drops.
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:57:31
Yup. My credit union tried giving me shit in the biggening but I just kept threatening to pull out if they didn't allow me to spend my money how I wanted and they complied
@_date: 2019-09-25 21:27:25
This is why I don't give them money when they ask for it. Instead I tell them that I'll teach them how to grow that money they seek. Also, after you get wealthy you never know who's there to be your friend and who's there for you to be their bank. Boy are they disappointed when tell them I'll refer them to a loan business I bought instead of loaning it directly through myself
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:29:52
Probably, I've been in this game for 10 years and seen that countless times. I'm at least happy to see this new turn of event though
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:31:57
Any idea what sample sizes mean? Just dig through the comments. I'm not the only one having this same experience. Nocoiners are starting to not be fazed by the drops in consideration for entry
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:40:31
Nope, they even sent me screenshots of their first purchases following up with letting me know they've set up recurring buys.

@_date: 2019-09-25 02:15:44
That is true when it's weak hand investors. This however is nocoiners I'm talking about. Nocoiners tend to always have a negative perspective during down turns to reassure themselves that not investing was the right call. Never have I seen a nocoiner express interest during a dip, only during rises. Today I've seen every nocoiner contacting me asking how they can cone in. I've only seen this in the investing world for established brands like coke or microsoft. New people expressing interest in an asset they're not in during a downturn that is
@_date: 2019-09-30 21:22:38
That it replaces the banks that unfairly set up the economy in their favor in a way that perpetuates debt enslavement by making loans the only option for many in the inflation poor taxing economy they have built
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:08:46
Because you want those you know to grow their own funds so they can stop asking you for money and instead become investment partners

Yup, the biggest thing people are missing in the corporate system. The dept is fucked. Only a new currency that they can accept and accumulate that grows faster than this debt in the long run can save them. I wonder what that is/s

Already had several today within the top 3 comments on a thread of the front page lol. Not really that hard once you learn the reddit lingo we see everyday. I've had over 30 post on the front page before too with previous accounts, but that takes a lot more precise content and timing to do though.

Songs about bitcoin are the only songs I listen too. Found this one while curiously searching to see if there were any Spanish bitcoin songs. Shocked at how low the views are because it's actually good and a remake of the most viewed video on YT. I know of at least a dozen bitcoin songs in English not nearly half as good with over half a million views
@_date: 2019-05-30 08:14:14
Yeah cause that's what history shows. We'll probably break 10k and drop to 6k, then back past 20k at worst, but if you follow the history, percentage wise were more likely for break 50k, drop to 10k, then back to the next 1000% run up before an 80% drop. I've been doing this for 8 years. Everyone I get in I give historical data percentages for safety levels of investment. I've instructed him to stop past 15k with heavy amounts till it reaches the next peak. 
Teach investors wisely and they wont freak.
@_date: 2019-05-09 04:41:44
Why not do a 400 million hack and grow us 10k instead of 1k?
@_date: 2019-05-30 01:14:14
It's just the best way to buy. If you go all in at once you might scare yourself if there's a drop. Though I'm the type to buy all at once, but I've been doing this for a long time so I know not to freak in a drop. A new person would

This is what 5 dollars can teach people �� once they see the first one grow, they realize how much better here their expendable 5 dollars are than on a coffee.

Is that supposed to be offensive? Cool, you're so cool because you tried to bring someone down to your level. Hope you get happy enough one day to not feel the need to try and bring others down so you can make yourself feel better.

I think binances safu funds might've cause this bump by creating market confidence. All I've seen since the hack is people talking about how regulation should be in place requiring all exchanges to have this type of safety net. Which I agree with. But this hack might've been a market confidence blessing in disguise.
