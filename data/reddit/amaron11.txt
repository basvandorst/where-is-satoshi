But when the central bank gives out that money to them, then they can fractionally reserve that
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:32:40
Yeah but then they’re going to have issues with the dollar losing value if they do, it’s either bad situation or bad situation 
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:58:36
No not at all, they create more and give that out as a loan. With extra supply of dollars prices keep rising to equal the amount of dollars. 
That’s why prices keep rising, not because they’re more valuable but because dollars are becoming less valuable
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:13:30
Yes there is because you can’t create more bitcoins out of thin air because you feel like it unlike regular dollars

Bank... central bank... same kettle of fish
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:54:52
No so banks can use your savings to give out as a loan. 
But currently central banks can also create new dollars and give them out as a loan AS WELL. 
With bitcoin you can only use people’s savings, making it much fairer for us and banks profits to be significantly smaller

Okay then, well how do they work? 
Explain to me step by step how they work. Do some research, and come back to me and tell me what you find
@_date: 2019-04-18 02:06:22
Exactly, net gain from inflation is 0. 
But inflation works well for the big boys workers don’t like asking for pay rises, even though a pay rise only means to equate inflation we still don’t ask for it. So over time workers get paid less. 
Combine that with never ending currency means the value of assets keep going up. Which again the big boys love

Fractional reserve lending is not the issue. That is an efficient way to use money. The problem is the central bank being able to create more, and giving that out as a loan as well............. you walnut

So, the whole economy is controlled by the government. When they want a boom time we have a boom time. And when they want a recession we have a recession. 
This explains it really well 
So we only have a liquidity crisis when they create one, im hoping by then things will change

the banks can hand out as many IOUs as they want. It doesn't matter if these IOU are in bitcoin or in fiat... debt is still money. As long as people put their fiat or bitcoins in a bank or exchange account it can be loaned out even with only a fraction actually backing it.
No they can’t, so eventually they won’t have enough money in the bank for people who need to use it that they can’t hand out that money. Literally the point of limited supply is that it’s not unlimited, by definition they can’t give out endless amounts of money forever and bury us in debt. 
There’ll always be loans and debt with money that already is in circulation. But they can’t bury us in new money which they create out of thin air and give it out as a loan

Thank you my man 
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:20:20
Always been the case, since central banking existed
@_date: 2019-04-18 06:49:16
Sort of yes and no. For one it can depend which asset, if it’s also a company in growth stage then yes. 
But also still kinda yes because your assets are going up while everyone else’s money is going down 
Bridging you a gap between them
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:23:48
No it’s not to stop lending, but it’s so they can only lend out money that actually exists. Not just create more and lend out that too
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:00:44
Oh no it’s not conspiracy level. Oh they willingly tell you what they’re doing. They’re just lucky enough that most of us don’t bother to listen

Roy28282- wish I could upvote that comment more than once
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:40:33
Same system in every country
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:28:40
Yes but only to a certain degree, they will have to store some for when people want to use their crypto. And after that they can’t loan out more until they earn more back from interest. 
Currently you can just get a central bank to print more money. Loan out that as well
@_date: 2019-04-18 06:54:17
But people who hoard their money don’t store it in dollars, they store it in assets, which can bridge their gap faster
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:36:27
Yes but you can’t create NEW bitcoins and give them out as debt
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:24:49
Central bank creates money. They give out that money as a loan to our banks. Those banks give that out as a loan to us.

Debt being paid off doesn’t get deleted. If that was the case prices wouldn’t rise, we wouldn’t have inflation. When debts are being paid off they then use that money to give as new loans to new people. 
There is always enough money, if it’s fixed in supply and population increases then simply the value of each bitcoin will increase, making us have enough bitcoin to keep going. 
If that guy loses his job and can’t pay back the $5, that money hasn’t disappeared, it instead went to the people he payed. They put that money in their bank accounts. Which the bank then lent out to other people again. Exactly how it should be. Not being able to go to the printer at the back end and get money from them too. 
It’s like you were a farmer and some cows you had to feed and require grass and then need to be butchered for the meat. And then there’s other cows you can just create of thin air, already cut up and ready to go. I mean, you’d be fucking rich!
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:52:46
What are you talking about? Are you trying to say that I think it doesn’t exist? 
What I’m saying is with Bitcoin they can only lend out the money they have. They can’t just go to the back end and create more and give that out as a loan as well
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:28:58
Every country works with the same system
@_date: 2019-04-18 06:51:26
There’s a possibility people will wake up and demand that we change that. Just like how their isn’t for regular money
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:02:21

It is not contracting, it is staying the same, if it was contracting bitcoins would be getting destroyed
