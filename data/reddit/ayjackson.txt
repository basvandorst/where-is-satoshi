"Costs" are the legal fees you are awarded when you win at trial. And, as a lawyer, let me assure you that "costs" are based on government issued tables which *maybe* cover 50% of the average lawyer's bill, if not less. I hate clients who think they'll get their "costs" when they win. You never do. Sometimes you win and the judge won't give you costs anyway, they are discretionary.

Efficiency will get better, but that gain is slowing down fast. From 55nm to 28nm was about a 66% reduction in energy use per hash. 28nm to 20nm looks only to be 30%. The 14-16nm chips won't be out until 2015, and expect an even lower efficiency gain. Therefore the ability to move that kw usage per bitcoin down significantly is not there. Yes it will be less in a year, but if it's 30 kw per billion difficulty instead of 40, you're still using tons of power. Mines set up in low energy cost jurisdictions (Washington, Sweden, Quebec, Labrador) will eventually force the Belgian and Chinese miners out of the market. Watch that dividend collapsed over the next six months as the power cost per bitcoin mined rises.

@_date: 2014-04-26 16:23:50
All those things are good, but look at stats for kw of power per bitcoin mined as difficulty goes up. Very very roughly it's about 40 kw/1 billion difficulty/1 bitcoin mined. Throw in an estimate of future difficulty and watch their share of mining increase very quickly. (Being saved by a rise in bitcoin prices will only encourage more mining and erode your shares further.) The dividend is unsustainable. There's a reason the private mines are in much lower power cost jurisdictions.

Dividend was down 20% this week, hosing is under way. Operating costs also jump several percentage points. Can't run a mine in Belgium, way too expensive.

I can tell you Newfoundland's is a mess of overlapping deeds and no easy way to search the system easily. From what I'm told, Massachusetts has the same problem. In a registry system, as opposed to land titles, deeds don't reference the prior deeds in anyway. Both haven't switched due to cost of converting.

Break even now, excluding hardware, overhead and employee costs, and with a 0.6w/GH chip, is just about 9 cents/kWh. That's tight for China.
We get power cheaper in Oregon, Washington and parts of Canada. And our power rates have been flat for 10-20 years.

The business case never made sense. Why would someone rent mining space unless they were retarded? Surely, if it made money the business/hoster would just mine for themselves. The hoster would only ever rent if the customer was foolish enough to "lock-in" a loss by paying the hoster for the privilege of being paid a negative ROI over a long period of time. However, in my extensive research and exhaustive studies I found out that a significantly larger portion of the population was retarded than I originally thought.

The large exchanges had the securities commissions bring down the hammer. Most shut down. Some fled to friendlier jurisdictions, like Panama.
However, the main issue is no real company that needs to raise millions would bother listing on these exchanges. If you went to list on a fiat exchange or sell your business, those anonymous shareholders present a huge liability.
So the companies they got were largely scams or failed business models. Neo &amp;amp; Bee being a prime example of a scam. Raised millions. I don't think they ever caught the guy either.
And on the failed business models side a ton of "hey I'm 15 and if you guys lend me $10,000 I'll buy a bunch of BFL gear and make us all rich".
If you have a good business plan, you can find someone wealthy to privately lend you the money.

Russia did give away trillions of USD of fiat, so for your plan they have to unwind this first, by buying it back, then do a commodity peg, which is just as artificial as any other peg.
If they don't buy back their current currency, no one will trust the new one. (Or you wait until the current ruble is worthless, but at that point the economy is ruined.)
Pegged currencies don't work. Trading for things in oil and setting up debt obligations valued on oil sounds like a terrible plan.

In Canada they're all the same for trading, capital gains.

You also have to implement KYC and AML as part of it, whether MSB or not, but, yes, it doesn't cost that much.

Caymans has loose securities regulations. China has very tight securities regulations. "The West" has tolerated the Caymans. China cracks down on unregulated securities dealers. Running an anonymous exchange would piss off Chinese regulators. They don't allow stuff like that. I know, I know, "America bad!" But this isn't about "dollar hegemony", this is about "where is it currently legal to do this." If you think China is going to allow an anonymous securities exchange, I suggest you go try that out. (And breaking securities law in China can come with jail time.)
Edit: Also I did do a history undergraduate degree and the Opium Wars left Hong Kong with British style laws and security regulations. How's that for a history bomb.

Get an accountant. The tax rate varies depending on your country. In Canada a miner can call it inventory and/or capital property. (Usually splitting will result in the lowest price.) Likely the same elsewhere. If you're a trader it's capital gains. An accountant will sort it out for you, that's what they do.
Source: I am a lawyer and the answer to almost any tax question is "you should probably have an accountant".

You're right in that some people will get away with breaking the law, they always do. But if you convert your bitcoins to a fiat currency and use the money for a large purchase, expect some heat.

No but they'd ask when and at what price you bought that bitcoin... And capital gains! Don't try to fool the IRS. If you do, you're no smarter than Wesley Snipes. If you have a huge gain, get a tax lawyer.

It's only a matter of time that mining becomes purely a margins game. Equipment, electricity, air conditioning and space will be your key costs. With our subsidized electricity rates (outside of Ontario that is) it's hard to find a better place for this than Canada. I'm from TO but I practice law in Newfoundland. (Where you wouldn't even need air conditioning...) I'm just waiting for the ASIC field to level before I jump in.

Remember when the Facebook founder renounced his US citizenship? Tax purposes. It's easier as a Canadian, if you're not here more than 6 months ( I believe) in a year and you make your money overseas, Canada won't tax you. (Which applies to our soldiers in Afghanistan too) But good luck avoiding the IRS... US citizens have a hard time avoiding them. Don't be like Wesley Snipes!

Caymans is far better for this than HK.
Edit: Also, Chinese authorities scare me way more than Western. Singapore would be a good Asian jurisdiction, but incorporation and a securities license would cost a small fortune.

Not saying I agree with governments on anything, but Id rather pay taxes than go to jail. Tax law is complicated and prisons aren't fun. That is the real world. If you buy a big house with no income, the government will have some questions.

Don't forget, they can ask for records of specific accounts if you get audited, so even by staying under the limit you're not necessarily getting away with it.

Money laundering declarations, which the bank sends the tax man, kick in around $7500 to $10000 depending on jurisdiction. (7500 on Canada)

For US (or Canadian) tax purposes, it doesn't matter if you made money in dollars, bitcoins or ice cream. They'll tax you. The US in particular will tax your income from anywhere, even if you earned your bitcoins while sitting in orbit. (Whereas Canada won't tax income earned "overseas", so long as you don't live in Canada that year. US citizenship attracts tax liability by itself.)
@_date: 2013-05-28 00:34:04
Just in case anyone is confused, fintrac's letter doesn't cover the "securities law" aspect, only money laundering laws. Canadian bitcoin exchanges will still be caught by provincial securities law. (And be treated as securities in many cases: exchanges, hedge funds, escrow etc)

The IRS will assess gains you made in gold, yen or euros even if you don't convert to USD. If you can prove you're still holding it all as an investment, then you can avoid capital gains, since its an ongoing investment. But if you start to spend them, you'll be assessed capital gains, at least on those you spent.
@_date: 2013-09-09 00:03:47
It's already taxable. Everything is taxable. US citizens are required to pay tax on all income made inside or outside the US. How it's taxed works the same in most countries: You pay capital gains (or write off losses) on holding coins. Bitcoins earned through mining can be treated as capital, and taxed as a capital gain, or as inventory, and taxed as income, or most preferably, partially as a capital gain and partially as inventory. Bitcoins earned as income, are taxed as income.
@_date: 2013-02-28 09:57:59
When you make money by buying and selling a house, the IRS sends you a bill for capital gains. If you buy and sell Japanese Yen, same thing. If you trade moon rocks and make a profit doing it, the IRS can and will find a way to assess capital gains. Just because the IRS doesn't take bitcoins doesn't mean they won't tax them. If you are a US citizen you must account for ALL income you made, bitcoin, moon rock, ice cream or otherwise.
@_date: 2013-02-28 10:03:55
You make good points but be warned, the IRS writes the rules book for assessing capital gains. They'll tax you. This is just like any foreign currency to them. And your bill will be in USD. I am a (Canadian) lawyer. Trying to screw the IRS or CRA is like pulling a fast one on the mob... They'll get you eventually.
@_date: 2013-02-28 16:21:11
Sorry, i was imprecise. Of course, you must declare, no bill coming from the IRS. Unless you're audited, then you get charged, which is kind of like a bill.

I believe that's change in the download rate. So if it rose previously month over month, change of negative 100% would be nil growth, anything lower would indicate a fall in downloads.
