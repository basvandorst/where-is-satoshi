I don't care about upvotes. I saw this on and was answering the question. I think botvoin has potential but it's not great. If it doesn't get accepted at almost every regular, live chain stores in a few first world countries, imo it's more or less a failure and I don't want that risk. It's cool you guys do, and it's an interesting idea, but the only two consistent uses right now are money laundering and online drug deals.

I'll be honest. I don't care about btc. It's way to easy to go up and down a ton for no reason other than 'China', the only place I can use it at is overstock.com and steam, or exchange it and get a decent chuck taken away by the website. I'm not putting a thousand dollars down on some crappy bet I either win and have to cash out or lose and get depressed. Not worth it.

Well, your first claim is just wrong. I mint 10 Kevinbuxs and give each of my friends one. In 1 year 6 of my friends burned their Kevinbuxs. The supply decreased from 10 to 4. I just deflated a currency.

Or it could fizzle out, be replaced by another cryto and the community could decided that Bitcoin is only worth a few bucks to them now. With no ties to anything but processing power btc could drop to $0 or $100000000 tommorow for all we know.

Another cryto could easily replace Bitcoin and tank its value, or it could be a a hundred thousand a coin. Also, it's about $3 to send it currently iirc. If you want to be a currently, I should be able to buy a coffee without paying more for the transaction fees.

You also have to pay an insane amount to send it, but yeah. Also, cash works the same way, and the price isn't liable to change 10% by the time your friend has it in their wallet.

Currencies have their value tied to or backed by something. Bitcoin is literally just a stock market to gamble on.
