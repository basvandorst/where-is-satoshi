Need to subscribe to a bank to do that.  You think they don't make money from you?

Why wouldn't there be fees in the online system?  Do you think that the transmission of your money over a worldwide digital network is free by nature? There are no fees when exchanging paper wallets.

Fear is far more powerful.

I mean seriously, the "but muh roadz!" argument?

No one "pays" their taxes.  Taxes are SURRENDERED. ��

Yes, I do.  Some things, by definition, can not be voluntary.  Like rape, theft, and assault.  A violation of property rights is not a violation unless it is involuntary.

I'm in construction.  I've built probably a couple miles of concrete road.  None funded by taxation.  Try again.

Why don't you think Andreas made it to the show?

No such thing.  Can you voluntarily be raped?  You can not voluntarily be robbed.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:29:38
There practically are no places absent of wannabe warlords trying to rob people.  Essentially the same thing.  
Say there actually isn't a place, you have yet to refute an idea I'm promoting.

I thought LTC's development of the lighting network makes this step by BTC more or less unnecessary.  But, like, I'm kinda dumb sooo...
Give me answers Reddit.

You can not consent if coercion is used.
The government coerces(threatens the use of an initiation of force) you in order for you to comply and surrender to taxation.
If you consented, then you wouldn't call it "taxation".  You'd just call it a "payment".  You can opt out of a payment without physical violence being threatened against you.  You can not opt out of taxation without such repercussions.  That is the difference, and it's a big difference.
It's the same difference between sex and rape.  It's all about CONSENT.  If you believe that taxation is legitimate, then you must not care about consent.

Also, no one pays taxes.  In order for a 'payment' to occur, all parties must consent.  Once that consent has been violated (via theft(taxation)), then it is no longer consensual, ergo, no longer a payment.
Taxes are not paid.  They are surrendered.

Again, not possible.  That's no more possible than voluntarily being raped.

I am against the state, or centralized, coercive government.
The societies that tolerate violations of individual liberty (such as theft) the least, are the "better societies".

The government trying to enforce net neutrality.
