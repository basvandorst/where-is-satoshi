How is the device encrypted? If it is a software encryption you should make a raw copy of that stick first using something like dd
After that you should have a 1:1 copy of that stick and you do not risk losing any data while trying to recover the passwort from the copy.

Coinbase is holding your private keys, so don't consider your funds being secure as long as you are not holding your keys yourself in a wallet on your Desktop (electrum wallet) or mobile wallet (Samurai wallet - android)!!!
with your own wallet on your device you can select your fees by yourself. look at mempool statistic if you want to set fees really low but still having them mined in adequate times. Right now that would be 30-50b/sat but that can change quickly.
you could use fee estimation if that's to complex for you, but you will most likely pay to much or you will not be able to get into one of the next blocks.
once again: not your keys - not your bitcoin. not your keys - not your bitcoin....

1. Let me try to clear up one thing about "becoming part of the blockchain" by giving an analogy: Imagine a beach with a lot of sand. If you create a wallet on bitcoin it's like you choose exactly one grain of sand to be your specific grain of sand. With chosing it, you will get an exact location on that beach. That exact location is your private key. You can now pin transactions to that grain of sand by telling someone a kind of abstract location description (the address,  I will not go further in describingthis). The bitcoin is then transferred from her grain of sand to yours.
What I want so say is: There is no "becoming part of the blockchain" since it's already there, you just pick a valid point in the overall space (the sum of grains of sand).
When you generate an offline wallet you use a cryptographic algorithm to generate a private key which is a valid key in the system. 
There of course is a chance that anyone picks exactly the same private key as you but it's so unlikely like finding an exact grain of sand at a beach.
Hope that helps understanding how it works. Its oversimplified of course.

It's not a viable option anymore since the Bug has been fixed in 0.16.3. From this version blocks which contain malicious information are invalid (simplified). Publishing blocks including malicious information would lead to a chain split.

Think of your bitcoin as a digital copy of a file. You own that file because you redeemed it in some way. So it's your property. 
Think of the Blockchain as a data center where your file is stored (but in multiple instances). Assume that your file is encrypted with a password. You have the password so only you can access the file. If you give the password to someone else is still is your file but the other party can access the file and could remove it. If you don't allow the other party the removal but he removes it anyways it is considered thief (by law).

Blockchain is not a mysterious thing that revolutionizes the world by itself. It is a Ledger that has blocks which are filled with transactions. And the blocks are chained. 
The revolution lies in the decentralized system of storage of the blockchain.

I give my 2 cents but to say it clearly: I'm a Bitcoin maximalist so you won't get objective answers from me.
1. There was that hard fork in 2017 over the (ever lasting) scaling debate. A part of the community forked because they were not satisfied by the outcome of that debate. That is: Segwit over Segwit2x. Bitcoin is about consensus rules. In my opinion by far the largest amount of people chose to follow the Segwit way.
2. The BCH community consisted of several people that I am very skeptical about. Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright are just two of them even if they forked again with BSV. 
3. Compare the "hate" here against the "hate" in . Over the last two years that other sub was a shitshow orders of magnitudes larger than in this sub. People in tend to hate agains BCH from time to time but It's not that obvious as over at the other sub.
4. The BCH community brags about a lot of things. 18months here, segwit there, scalability, nodes, walla walla walla. And still they couldn't achieve what they are up to: the flippening. 
5. The BCH community is saying "BCH is Bitcoin" which I think is obviously false since the community, the consensus and the protocol decides what is bitcoin. Bitcoin is BTC, Bitcoin Cash is BCH. That's it. BCH is a fork and is not Bitcoin.
6. They are using which is the Ticker symbol of BTC. Why?
And countless other things. They have a more centralized development and the community follows their leaders blindly therefore they could advance the protocol faster than BTC. I understand that BCH might have a nice interface in the [Bitcoin.com]( wallet or they have 0conf and schnorr but hey... Bitcoin is improving too and there is a lot of development going on and there is a ton of discussion on other media than reddit.

@_date: 2019-11-15 09:41:24
That's actually the correct answer even if it sounds weird. 
As you can see on the mempool website fees basically rose from 1 to 2 sats/byte for transactions to clear. While this is in fact a 100 percent increase in this scenario in times when overall fees are higher it doesn't matter so much since you only need 1sat/byte more than these transactions.
It's looking worse than it really is when you consider the other graphs beside the mempool size.
It will show once again that the game theoretic approach of bitcoin works for events like this and that there is no incentive to "spam" a network like this, since it's just consuming money for little effect.
Therefore "this is good for bitcoin" is also a valid point.
@_date: 2019-11-15 09:30:13
To be fair, the mempool is around 100mb right now. That's indeed a lot and a rare event. Zooming out does not paint a clear picture here.
Look at this: 
Since it's all 1sat/byte it's not very concerning. And calling it "spam" isn't really correct since that are all valid transactions.
It will take some while to clear up, until then fees will rise slightly above normal.
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:56:03
There should be a field "Transaction Hash". You can click on it. Are there 3+ confirmations? What's the output address? Is it  "12HaVrpXxLr2UnkMf6X9bY11cuNrZUdUnV"?
Did you send it via coinbase pro?
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:22:12
So, it seems that the BTC landed on [eobot.com]( which is an Exchange. If you are not jhonatan and as you stated the transaction should go to binance then the address has most likely been forged on your computer.
Regarding that you said you double checked the address was correct when you entered it at coinbase it has been altered on the binance side.
Binance would have absolutely no reason to generate an incorrect address for you.
My conclusion is, that your computer is infected with a virus that waits for address generation in the html of binance and forges the value into another address.
What is a bit odd is that there is this public information of the address on [eobot.com]( I would assume that someone who puts effort in writing a virus would be so dumb to make public information visible. 
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:14:53
Thanks for your honest and grounded response. I think we both agree that arguing about this topic is very difficult.
On point 3: I know what you mean since the general response here is "ah, fuck bch". Sometimes posts even get redacted and removed because of "altcoin talk". What I meant is the overall amount of topics on the other sub that are directed to shine a bad light on BTC. You will not find a lot of those posts like this here in my opinion. For me it feels like an echo chamber (sure this sub is aswell but there is not that kind of comparison to another coin here).
Again, this is my humble opinion and I might well be brainwashed over the years...
For 5: The whitepaper is not a holy grail, in fact there are some things inside the whitepaper that are undoubtedly no longer holding true (something something CPU mining). I feel that this is also the case with Block sizes. 
Increasing the Block size leads to centralization because the increased size would instantly used by side- or spam chains like Veriblocks. Fees would adapt to what they are today and nothing is won. Instead there would be increased storage capacity needed which would further complicate Full Nodes to operate. There are also propagation problems for very large blocks.
Just increasing Blocksizes seems not to hold today even if satoshi himself spoke about that. Block sizes will eventually increase at some point but I guess it will be in small steps.
I am developing on lightning and I can see a future there. I made a lot of payments over lightning and it feels very usable. I had technical discussions with so many people about improvements of lightning that I come to the conclusion that it might be some kind of next generation of crypto.
We will see how it plays out. I hope we can have another discussion in a few month or years when things developed. I'll try to stay open minded and follow both or all sides.
Thanks again for your rational response :)

Nothing is bad with savings. If you save, you will get a reward because bitcoin is deflationary. So you say that you would rather keep it than spending it. That's a good thing, nothing wrong here. Wrong is the assumption that this is a problem, which is not. You might come to the point that saving more is not possible because you need to buy groceries. You automatically start spending even if it would be more efficient to save just because you are not able to save more. 
Two problems:
1. You divide between bitcoin as your "savings" and on the other side money for everyday living. This could change with one Application release or maybe for you on that one day when you decide to receive your wage in bitcoin and need to convert it to fiat. Then suddenly it's the complete other way around. But that might never happen...
2. The capitalist inflationary monetary system with zero interest rates fundamentally changed peoples minds into "Spending is better than saving". Remind yourself that a lot of people were saving money because it payed off in the 70s 80s and 90s and before. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:48:14
Seriously, I don't know how to handle that article
"Bitcoin’s market share is dropping across the market."
That simply is not true at the moment. And it's so easy to look up: [
Also: "Many altcoin supporters are anxiously awaiting the 'flippening'  – an event that happens when another coin manages to surpass Bitcoin in  market capitalization and other metrics.  Community members from other  popular coins like ETH and BCH have been expecting this for over a year."
Of cause BCH is awaiting the 'flippening'. That's what they are shouting since the hard fork. I don't support larger Blocks and I'm very happy with segwit (and lightning) but still BCH was at least an option for the 'flippening'. But it simply didn't happen. And there is only one way that it could still happen: A major flaw in BTC that reveals that segwit was bad in the first place. This is so highly unlikely.
"Each has their own project, company, team, utility, levels of funding,  traction, community, and business model. We believe these companies’  valuations should not be tied to Bitcoin and should be valued on their  individual merits, much like a traditional stock market."
I disagree here. In the crypto space bitcoin already achieved what a crypto-maximalist wants: The true value of an Asset or specialized coin is measured against a decentralized crypto currency. The Value should not be converted into USD, that makes no sense. The article tries to spin this around with "should be valued on their individual merits" which is nothing else than saying "should be valued in USD". If you compare your shitcoin against BTC you can see how it performs, that's your "individual merits".
I think the article is somewhat misleading.

yes. it's free of choice. Your old version will continue to work. Updating software is always a good idea.


A hard fork is a fundamentally different thing. A hard fork is simply the clone of your program but it's no longer compatible with your program (as in bitcoin cash vs bitcoin) or a different approach (like in LibreOffice and OpenOffice). Hard forks are usually a total different team splitting away from the original program towards a (in their eyes) "way better solution". A simple software update like this is in no way connected to a hard fork.


A lot of people are contributing to bitcoin. A lot of people are reading differences between this and the last version which is easy to do. Each piece of new code submitted to bitcoin is heavily reviewed and Acknowledged before it's merged into the master. Google "pull requests". One could not simply walk into master with his own code. Technically it could "crash everything" but that will not happen. It just won't.


We're talking about a simple software update here, not about a complete other system where someone with huge amounts of btc moves into. A software update happens from time to time and everyone is just updating software because it's a good thing.

To add some more detail here:
Mining is essentially finding a hash over some input data that qualifies against the current difficulty. 
The input is at least containing the coinbase transaction (the transaction to give you the reward), the previous block hash, block height (current block number), timestamp and some more metadata. It does not need to include any other transactions other than the coinbase transaction. 
The mining begins with creating a hash over this block data. The returned hash may result in a value with leading zeroes. If this leading zeroes are longer than the amount of zeroes specified by the current difficulty it qualifies as a valid block and will be propagated over the network. If not, a nonce is increnemented and the hashing of the block restarts with the incremented number until you find a nonce that leads to a block hash with more leading zeroes than specified in the current difficulty. 
Empty blocks have a very thin time advantage against blocks including transactions since including transactions into the block template before starting to create hashes takes an amount of time. This is why miners create empty blocks from time to time. But the advantage is really small.

Theoretically: yes they could seize the equipment and try that.
Would they be successful? Doubtful. The efforts to keep that private would need a shit ton of preparation to not disclose the plan to the mining pool members and the community. 
The sudden removal of 50% of hash power would likely raise concerns unless it's planned perfectly which increases the efforts a lot.
It's also unclear why there would be an incentive to do so. Bitcoin might come to a point where it's more likely but right now it seems that bitcoin is no threat to the Chinese government. Laws are enough to scare the shit out of people and prevents them from doing stuff, especially in more authorian countries.

Yes. I think the water bottles analogy is helpful here. When you open a channel to someone you and the channel opposite are each getting a bottle. Yours is full, the receiver's is empty. You could only receive if you pour water to the other side. 
So if a buyer opens a channel to the merchant the merchant gets an empty bottle as "can receive" amount. The size is obviously defined by the channel capacity the buyer uses

Difficulty is calculated by how hard it is to find a hash below a given target.

You can export your private key of bitcoin core and import it into a wallet like electrum. Never (!!!) put that private key into a website and make sure you are downloading electrum from the official page (electrum dot org).
Here is a detailed instruction on how to export your private key from bitcoin core:

That is not correct. The lightning wallet part of bluewallet is custodial. They do the channel management and store your lightning wallet balance.
If you need a noncustodial solution you should use another app, I think the lightning wallet from lnd or zap are available for iOS.

I have a c-lightning node up and running since the first nainnet beta. I chose it because of being in cpp like bitcoin core. 
Runs really well. If you have more questions feel free to ask.
Edit: I also have lightning-charge running that can be utilized with a JSON REST Webservice for checkouts from a Website.

What do you mean by "user friendly"? Bitcoin applications in general are not very "user friendly" because you need to get Bitcoin from somewhere in the first place. Registering for an exchange, get verification, buy some. That's not your average Joe's Internet experience.
So you got here into the daily discussion thread so I assume you are tech savvy enough to have completed all those steps I mentioned. And you want to tell me that it's hard to do the few extra steps to have lightning working? Come on. Install Bitcoin Lightning Wallet on android, transfer bitcoin to it, open a channel, buy something from Bitrefill and voila you now have a Channel with return balance and you can receive payments. 
It's in development for long, and it is continued to be developed for a long time. My node runs flawelessly since it's in beta last February. This stability is what counts for me. Don't let yourself be impressed by idiots shouting "It's coming in 18months" and "It's not user friendly". Try it yourself and judge afterwards.

yeah, I really like the current trend and I'm sure we will see 50% segwit in a short time. I would have expected a larger increase with coinbase going segwit, but it takes more than just them it seems.
My data is just an excel-plot of the data from segwit.party and I'm not sure if the folks are ready for another SegWit-Graph-PNG yet, so I will not make one ;)
But right now I'm reviewing the raw block data from my node so that I eventually build my own segwit graph as a webapplication.

I generally agree with your rant against RT but I would also tend to say that RT is publishing in a narrative that doesn't fit into mine (and yours). [insert whataboutism here]
In this particular case the article is just vague overall. The interviewer refers to a statement from the German federal bank regarding the denial of access to the gold. The article clearly misses to cite the source, which is bad. 
This is the main argument of the article, it creates a hot air balloon out of "the government is unaware" since the questioned ministry of finance is referring the question back to the federal bank.
One could call it "propaganda" but I would call it "clickbait".
Sorry for mistakes, am German..

In ancient times when Bitcoin was around 20k, people were saying: "Bitcoin will never cost 10k. Because I will buy all of it".

I think electrum is the most recommended software wallet. If you want to make the first step and get your coins off an exchange but keep the ability to get it back there quickly I would totally recommend it to you. But, as said before, keep in mind that it is just  as secure as your computer is (same with paper wallets generated on that device).
If you want to improve further consider a Trezor or Ledger Nano.

For me it seems that trading starts at 1am GMT on the London market. So 8 pm EST seems to be correct.

What's really odd is that Deutschlandfunk, a well known and balanced radio station aired a feature "Global Cash transfers - That's how the Euro goes to the family" about basically all the things that Bitcoin is about: "Bank the unbanked" "how could money be open and borderless and censorship resistant". They spoke about how bad Western Union is and how it charges a lot of fees to immigrants that want to transfer money to their families back home.
Bitcoin was mentioned exactly 0 times. It was so confusing.

ASICs are in no way directly tied to Cryptocurrencies. ASICs are widely used in electronics.
Please read the wikipedia page: [
eASIC is a company that produces structured ASIC chips that deliver a greater performance than FPGAs, but less than real ASICs.


So, reading the article you can clearly see, that this acquisition is mainly a step towards faster Time To Market for integrated circuits.
It might give a hint towards what Intel is planning but in general one must say: It has no connection to Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies at all.

Is your node available from outside your network? You might need to open ports (9735) on your network router to allow connections to your node. 
You can use lnbig.com to get incoming balance. It provides a single command line command that opens the channel for a lot of node implementations.

why is convenience a bad thing? I give you an example: If English is not my primary language I might mix up some letters while writing down the seed words. that auto complete may hint me to the correct spelling when recovering from a seed with that incorrect spellings. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 07:57:51
Faster input of seed words. It will just look up in the seed wordlist to give auto-complete, it will not auto-complete your personal seed. So it will just be a convenience functionality. which is good for newbie users

The mempool is relatively full right now. 
If you have an urgent need for confirmation within the next 1-5 blocks you should choose at least 50sat/byte
@_date: 2019-05-28 09:54:08
I would like to add that "sovereignty over private data" or "privacy" is also one of the main reason for the creation of Bitcoin. Bitcoin originates from the cypherpunk movement in the early 90s. Read the (relatively short) [cypherpunk manifesto]( from 1993 for a closer look to this topic.
Adam Back, Hal Finney, Eric Hughes, Nick Szabo and many others were part of this movement and developed Solutions like HashCash and Bitgold which were the predecessors of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:42:24
I would say you are not fucked at all. Your transaction will be confirmed once the mempool clears up. After 14 days it will be dropped from mempool.
You could increase fees using RBF or the other side could utilize CPFP if there is an urgent need for faster processing. 
I'm too lazy to calculate how many sats/byte you chose but 9cents seem fairly low. You can see the sats/byte on various block explorers, just enter your transaction ID. 
Compare your sats/byte to the current mempool situation and you'll get an impression on how long it could take based on previous developments.
Don't panic if you don't need to ;)

Look, just saying "everything is hackable" is not really helpful. It sounds like a quote from a movie or something you heard someone say in another context.
You might want to specify what "breaks Bitcoin" and "like NSA" means in the first place.
First of all you need an incentive. You could come up with a few ideas:
\- steal all bitcoins
\- shut down the network
\- use bitcoin that are not yours
\- double spend confirmed transactions
\- breaking private keys
For the first one: Stealing all Bitcoin means that you need Access to all instances of Bitcoin nodes worldwide to manipulate every single Block that has been published since the beginning of Bitcoin. That's impossible to do.
The second one: This means you need to find a serious DoS weakness in every bitcoin implementation that exists and you need to coordinate in a way that there is no possible fix for that problem. That's impossible to do.
Using Bitcoin that are not yours: This happens a lot but it's an individual attack and has nothing to do with "hacking bitcoin"
Double spending is one of the only ways to really attack bitcoin. It happened in the past to other less secured (hashpower) coins. But it's very unlikely to happen on bitcoin because of the upfront cost.
Breaking private keys is also very unlikely to happen. Bitcoin is (at this time) not fully quantum prove. Updates of the used weaker algorithms only require a soft fork and are likely to get implemented if there will be a threat. This only affects future transactions. UTXOs are safe.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:08:30


I partly disagree. Making a system more efficient indeed makes space for increased spam but it also comes at no cost regarding the whole blockchain size. Which is not the case for simple Block size increases. 


Usability is what brought us PayPal and Visa.


There is some small amount of data you can transmit on a standard bitcoin transaction. It's part of bitcoin because OP_RETURN is. Space is very limited nevertheless. Since OP_RETURN is also used for burning coins and has a long and controversial history (2013) it's unlikely to be wiped away anytime soon.
Interestingly enough Bicoin Cash raised the OP_RETURN limit from 40 to 220 bytes to make space for new kind of applications. 
I think it's good to follow a more conservative approach overall.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:29:53
Just increasing the block size would lead to more applications like Veriblocks "spamming" the increased size. 
Just stacking blocksize isn't helpful. We need more solid development like more efficient usage of signatures, segregated witnesses, batching and so on.
We've had this discussions forever now. Why don't people realize that they are not the first thinking about all this...
