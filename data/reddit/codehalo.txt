It is your line thinking that give the "powers that be" their power. So many people think like you - particularly voters and the church goers. You are the enabler. When you get the balls to buy bitcoin (with serious money) whether they say so or not or whether it goes to 1 million or zero dollars is when you will be free from the "powers that be".
Apparently, money is only "serious" if they print it and tell you it is.

@_date: 2015-12-22 02:47:37
Until the banks realize an open cryptocurrency makes sense, they will consider it a threat.
The euphemisms that the banks love to use, such as "cut costs, reduce expenses", really means firing people. Within 10 years, the banks will be half the size they are now in headcount, due to the encroachment of various technologies in which cryptocurrencies will play a major role. 
Now, imagine the average bank is reduced to an extremely low number employees, due to most financial activity being automated. Is it wise for the public to trust these handful of companies with their opaque "permissioned" ledgers, when there are open permissionless ones available?
How would that be different from an exchange like Mt. Gox? Do think that they wont be held to the same standards as current Bitcoin companies, who are being demanded to post proof of reserves? Will the banks do it? Can you trust a bank if you can't see the ledger?
What they are attempting to do now is a fruitless endeavour. They would be better off using bitcoin - mining, acting as exchanges, and paying developers to improve the code.
Either way, they are going to cut costs via tech, and a lot of bank employees are going to lose their jobs. Just embrace Bitcoin. No point in being afraid of inevitability.

The thing about bitcoin is that the clear distinction between "customer" and "merchant" breaks down completely. Anyone can be either, therefore there is actually no need for a "complex payments system(s)" .

Even a broken clock is right twice a day. For him to argue that a centralized entity would be better than a trustless, decentralized one (for almost any purpose I should add) is the PINNACLE of ignorance.
History will prove that blockchain based systems - removed of requirements self interest will bring FAR FAR more rewards than the cabals we are seeing now. 
People like him make their money by having ACCESS, with bitcoin everyone has (or had) that chance. EDIT:Most people can't jump on the phone and make a call to Google or Yahoo, but everyone can download the Bitcoin whitepaper, see the future and get in without wall streets advice.
The reason why most Wall Streeters really hate crypto, is because they came LATE (at least from their point of view). Of course, now that they have figured out how ignorant they were, they are busy spreading FUD while they scoop up cheap bitcoin. Watch his tune change by next year.
I'm SURE that dumbfuck never had an investment that returned 15,000%.

Anyone taking the time to think about Bitcoins structure would see that its parameters were finely tuned for situations like these. The thinking behind it is truly remarkable.

If humans are involved at any stage in terms of the supply of nodes, there will be centralization, that's just a flaw in humans and it won't be eliminated unless humans are removed from supplying nodes. It won't be long before a Drama and Panic queen start s complaining about Unknown having 51%.
As a hypothetical example,  what if somehow every person contributed a node to network (one person one device as per the original vision),  it would be inevitable that the Americans will start complaining that the Chinese and the Indians had too much of the network.
You guys really need to step back and think this through, because until independent machines/devices are responsible for securing the network, the will be some variation of 51% of humans owning it.

Bitcoin doesn't redistribute wealth in the sense that it takes from the rich and allocate to the poor. When/If it becomes mainstream, it's most likely that the rich people will still be rich with bitcoins. A lot of people who got into bitcoins early will be rich too (and deservedly so), but thats how life works.
The things that bitcoin will enable will be mind blowing. If the creator(s) get richer than anyone else, good for them. 
Every time a new wealth creating industry comes along (oil, cars, computers, internet), the pioneers get extremely rich. This is no different.
EDIT: And to your point, no one really knows who Satoshi is. I think the incentives to keep the network functioning is critical to the creator(s). The probability of them doing something that would destroy it is extremely low. Also, it will become apparent that this so called "51% attack" is actually a feature as the system grows.
@_date: 2014-07-21 02:28:27
You are using over hundreds of years hindsight for the printing press, about a hundred years of hindsight for the automobile. Saying bitcoin does not provide the same level of innovation is premature and astoundingly shortsighted. 
I don't think you are prepared to have this discussion. You need to invest a bit more time understanding the fundamental ideas behind bitcoin, and after some time thinking about it you will have a few "aha" moments. I wouldn't call this a "healthy" debate.

It's not so much that I speak in absolutes than you are trying to frame your arguments as one of reason and being unbiased when you are not. Notice the way you framed your Bitcoin the global currency statement in a concerned but negative light while speaking of the settlement/Lightning Network (even if it is vaporware) in a more hopeful/positive tone. 
I think it can be argued quite convincingly that a **synthetic, forced "fee market"** based on open source software **in an open network** will be extremely difficult to achieve. Just like water and information, pricing will take the route of least resistance, which is a version of the software without artificial limitations.

Actually, *the media* was one making the unverifiable statement regarding Bitcoin, Greece, Cyprus. Further, when bitcoin was running up, the Greek and Cyprus people were on ATM lines, not localbitcoin lines, or more ridiculously, sending money to Bitstamp or wiring money Mt. Gox in Japan.
Even more so, the future greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, couldn't *stand* bitcoin, and had nasty comments on the topic. His opinion was the common train of thought.

You speak of two groups with two visions. So lets get right to the point: The original selling point of bitcoin was a p2p cash network. Without debate, this implies that blocksize would have to up.

Or just because MtGox was the motivation, a name from Magic the Gathering (Axbane or something like that) . Haha.

Besides the periodic table, Gold has no special place in the universe of things. Everything you mentioned above, other materials can do as well and better. This great monetary value people give to gold is based on belief.

Its more likely that individual governments will start accumulating bitcoins to protect themselves. It would be astonishing to me if the United States and China haven't begun doing so or at least is exploring it.

This thing is going to set back decentralized crypto currencies by YEARS.
Centralized, and own by billionaires. This will do to crypto-currencies what Internet Explorer did to browsers..

Some of WORST remarks about Bitcoin came from people who are now late adopters, and soon, the dumb ones out there will also be late adopters. Lack of vision (and shunning research) always puts one at a disadvantage.

It's clear the OP is trying to give bitcoin a bad name. Can people PLEASE vote this shit off the page?

Your ginger beer issue can/will be easily addressed:
It is possible for bitcoin to be stored on a credit card like medium. The user can swipe and enter a passcode to have the transaction executed.

The banks already have "a network of trust". I go to the bank, wire my money to Mt. Gox or Coinbase and i'm done. Ripple's intent is for them and their associates to own the this new closed/nebulous "network of trust". Stop peddling your "network of trust". Open source it so that we can TRUST your "network of trust".
Apparently, bitcoin was set upon us without bullshitting us about trust. Now more and more are trusting it. Thats how it should be.

Half decent report. However, they are still treating the inability for them to control it as a flaw, when it is indeed Bitcoin's greatest feature. They will learn from experience that any future altcoin that allows for government/bank control is inherently flawed and will be stillborn.

This has been going on since the run ups early in the year. Bitcoin is a game changer. Nothing will stop it. What banks say or do wont stop it. It's like taking car engine advice from a horse breeder or a carriage maker in the early 1900's. Avoid making decisions based on the doomsayers that post the loud rumors. Understand the technical aspects of bitcoin instead, and let that guide you in any decisions you may make.

No. Please tell us how in the world you can bypass the man's heavy handed regulation when dealing with fiat.
The only way i am currently aware of is if you have the man in your pocket, a la the banks.

If people are BUYING btc on Mt. Gox, then that is the market price, like it or not. 
This has been going on for a considerable time, and a lot of wizards on this sub has been predicting the death of Mt. Gox for nearly as long as the guys doing it for FreeBSD.
The Mt. Gox flight stampede should of had its intended effect by now... clearly there is no such thing.
Finally, there is this crude assumption that only USD matters, and all the other currencies on Gox are Zimbabwe dollars with lipstick.

And what is the importance of gold if has minimal use value? You can list a whole lot of things that horse carriage can do, but it has minimal use value. Where are they now? Gold has minimal use value and its exchange value is based primarily on scarcity and faith. When nanobots start collecting gold particles in the future, only faith in gold will remain, and its value will be close to zero.
