Yes, but it might not be a good idea, wait for the pullback.

There is correlation, lots of traders are trading weed stocks, like WEED, APH, CRON, etc.
I put all my money into them at this moment, because the short and long term look much brighter then that of cryptocurrencies, at his moment atleast :)

Maybe i misspoke, but i have all my cryptocurrencies left, and i got into MJ before the big run up, so you are incorrect
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:54:11
The dump happened because there wasnt enough volume to support an actual run, just look at the previous bull run, the volume was signifigantly higher.

In sweden the tax on crypto is 30%, with the etn, the total cost is about 5%, its pretty worth it for people speculating in the price in sweden.
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:55:07
Yea sorry, the ETN i hold says 2,5% per year, and the tax on ISK is 1,25%, so even less then 5% then :p

Totally agree with you about the greed part, 90% of the people are here for that reason, i must say tho, so am i, i cant lie to myself about, i think about the wealth it can bring me, hope it changes the world tho!

Retail investors yes, the big fish that holds 99% of the worlds wealth havent entered bitcoin yet.

So you mine btc, while your parents pay the electrical bill? Wich is probably higher then 0.1 btc at gis time, and will be for some time.

Never heard of coinotron, and its not affiliated with gdax, coinbase is affliated with gdax.
Are you a troll? Or did you mean coinbase?

You are stupid and ignorant, do you consume SVT and aftonbladet like its your religion ?
Claiming that poverty, unemployment causes terrorism is fucking stupid, 450 of 452 terrorist atttacks were made by MUSLIMS, last time i checked there are 1,5 billion of them, and sweden have THOUSANDS of EXTREME JIHADIST, go read the reports from fucking SÄPO.
Do you live in rinkeby, do you live in tensta? do you live in malmö?
No? you probably live on södermalm.
REFUGEES? they are NOT refugees, you idiot they are here because they want to use sweden as their fucking ATM, 90% of "refugees" in sweden LIE ABOUT THERE AGE, the majority of them are  MEN, WHERE ARE THE WOMEN?
30/32 provinces in afgahnistan are SAFE, so why do SO MANY of them come here do you think?
Thinking that the the majority of people who come to sweden come here because they are fleeing from war is ignorant and those kind of people do not live in the reality, neither do they read other news then that of the MSM media.
Sweden have MAJOR problems with rape, just ask yourself why BRÅ dont even want to make statisticts related race? 
Because that statisticts will show you that immigrants are EXTREMLY more likey to commit these crimes, wich isnt that much of news to most people, if you arnt a cucked swede who lives with his cat.
The police can't handle all the rape that is being commited in sweden, this is also A FACT, everything i have said is FACTS, you can look them up yourself, and WAKE up from your politicly correct slumber.
More police officers then ever are quitting the force, this is also a FACT, this is related to migrant crime.
There are extreme gang violence in malmö, there are extreme gang violence in Gothenburg, stockholm is not even the worst part, Malmö is far more closer to chaos then stockholm, because in stockholm the rich people live :)
Sweden also have the HIGHEST amount of poor old people in the nordic countries, this is because they choose to give money to the rapefugees and bearded children.
Go read nyheteridag, or go watch angry foreigner on youtube.
Or even BETTER go to rinkeyby, tensta, i work with people who live in tensta and rinkeyby, they are themself immigrants, and they AGREE WITH ME, not cucked swedes who hides in there basements.

By accepting a ETF the market would be less prone to manipulation, but ALL assets, stocks, commodoties are manipulated.

Not all Muslims follow sharia, neither does all muslims have desposible income, most of the money is in the hand of the saudi kings, ignorant to think that there is 1.6 billion new potential investors when the majority of these people dont know what bitcoin is, or how to buy it, most of these people will be kept in the dark, the saudi kings want to keep their power

You still need to get money on the exchange, and if your bank those kind of transactions, we are pretty much fucked.
