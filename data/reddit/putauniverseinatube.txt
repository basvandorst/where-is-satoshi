Judging from the volume seen on many of the large exchanges, this could even be the majority.

If you get lucky enough to time the movement of BTC correctly. That is something which is notoriously difficult to do.

I don't disagree with you regarding holding crypto on exchanges in the slightest. You triggered liberal SJWs how? Do you even know what those buzzwords actually mean?

That being said, Japan is still very much a physical-cash oriented society.

I dunno about you guys, but where I grew up this is pretty standard advice for anything financially related.

Can it be read or has it smudged?
