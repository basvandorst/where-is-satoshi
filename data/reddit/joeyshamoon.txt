What makes u say this?
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:49:37
Maybe they’re just starting out building a prototype or something? Apparently they’re shipping start of February so we will see, only time can tell once people try these things. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:16:20
What time

So do you think bitcoin will bounce back? Has the FUD been the same since 2012?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:38:19
Crashed again
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:24:12
I feel it could hurt the economy instead of BTC

Interesting post. I’m not sure either how it will affect the price 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:58
True. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:07:44
Transaction fees are too high and taking days to confirm, how is this sustainable? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:41:03
Go with your gut feeling

Could LN take years? If so, will we have enough time to buy before a coin overthrows BTC?

I have a feeling Roger Ver only wants to use BCH as a dummy to pump his money back into BTC... how do we know that he doesn’t actually hold more BTC than BCH and this is just a game to him

If one went down 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:32
Just a guess?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:57:33
From being in the space since May, I’ve seen this happen, it bounces back up. Don’t feel too disheartened. No one knows when, but when a lot of bad pressure is put against bitcoin, it grows back stronger as people notice it can’t be destroyed. These dips will only cause it to slingshot in 2018
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:31:18
I also find it hard to believe that the bitcoin core developers will want to let another coin beat theirs... thoughts?

Is everyone ready to dump bcash or something 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:27:10
With the trillions and trillions of dollars in the world and other currencies, I believe some of it will go into crypto, even if it’s 1 percent. So I do think it will hit over 20k without scaling. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:12:24

Where Can I see the adjustment change date? Also, has it changed since the market has taken a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:17:29
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:42
So what do you think will happen now? Will people dump bcash for BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:33:46
Good news for BTC core then

It is ridiculous, but a lot of the most doesn’t need to come from the average joe, it might be big corporations investing

Is this regarding the CBoE?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:00:07
So... it’s slower and more expensive to use, does the consumer care about 300bn purchasing power or cheap transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:36:03
 under ‘difficulty retarget’ is it this? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:22:04
You can 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:19:42
So do you think the price will go back up to where it was?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:38
This pump and dump just shows the fraud people as they are. This raises more legitimacy in bitcoin

Great post
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:54:27
Do you reckon that will happen tomorrow when the difficulty changes? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:16:50
I have the same feeling 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:57:38
More like why did you take a mortgage out? Only invest what you’re willing to lose
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:17:52
Now you’re just assuming 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:39:03
Should I be looking under ‘difficulty retarget?’
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:01:26
Where is this?
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:55:58
or blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:10:15
Yes. It's not connected to the internet so less prone to getting hacked

I've read this but don't get the difference between Main and Split. Can you explain in simple terms please? Thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:53:43
So the best thing is to click the split button? Does that mean I'd need to send the BTH to another external wallet or to the same Ledger wallet I have? Thanks 
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:52:56

Yes you can work for them just the same way you work for Euros  or Pounds, you just need to find someone who will pay you in BTC - if you want to buy bitcoin I would recommend Coinbase as a start.

 *Edit* \- full disclosure: I’m in investment management. Not involved with crypto other than out of academic interest, and have followed bitcoin closely since 2013. 
I bet you wish you bought and held.. funny you say HODLing is a myth, I reckon if you bought when you were interested you would be saying something completely different.

@_date: 2017-11-07 17:28:09
Nice, thanks. Do you know what’s causing it to drop? If it stays below 80% does that mean s2x won’t go ahead? 
@_date: 2019-06-06 18:57:03
I can't state why you should or shouldn't, it's up to you but if you've written 62 articles it would be a waste of time to give up now. Crypto isn't mainstream and if it's your passion you should carry on
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:57:28
This will be the new low in a few years.

move your coins to another wallet to be safe, but make sure you copy the correct address, run an anti virus scan too

So do you reckon BCH is just going to keep going up? I think it will be used more for daily transactions whereas BTC will just be a store of value

What’s the link to access this
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:51:10
Research more into Bitcoin, don't invest all of your money in it, only invest what you're willing to lose. Maybe look into investing $500 maximum to begin with, once you're more confident in the space then you can look into investing more.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:10:05

So will b2x be accepted on coinbase straight away? Have they posted anything about it?

It most likely is. Go with your gut feeling

Try Ledger Nano S 
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:54:47
if what you say happens, then they will inflate the price of bitcoin to millions of dollars so that the average Joe won't be able to afford it, at that point i wont care

Congrats! Have you been following the space constantly for 3 years or just invested?

You don’t want to stress yourself out too much, play it like a game. If you lost all your money within bitcoin, would you be upset/Angry? If the answer is yes, you should only invest what you’re willing to lose. It’s much more fun when you don’t have an emotional attachment to the end result, because Bitcoin doesn’t have an emotional attachment to you or any of us, that’s why I say only invest what you’re willing to lose... or I might be wrong and Bitcoin could hit 10K by the end of the year and you’ll be minted. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:39:50

Yes 100%. You can contact Ledger and ask them yourself 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:47:04
Because USD and GBP is different. The price of BTC is the same but when transferring it to a fiat currency it will be different, this isn’t anything bitcoin can control

Exactly, turning off the internet would cause more problems like hospitals being unable to function, BTC will be the last of our worries by then.

They won't, and if they do - it's probably good news for BTC in the long term. They've been saying for years now, I remember in 2017 when they were banning it and un-banning it every week.... I assume to manipulate prices
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:31:37

Never more than what you're willing to lose
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:38:29
I think its impossible to tell if the price during October time will drop further than it has now. I do think it completely depends on what you're looking to do with your Bitcoin. If you're planning to hold for a number of years, will the price difference between now and October matter to you? You run the risk of it climbing way higher over a few hundred dollars, but it's completely up to you. No one knows truly where it will go.

I recommend maybe contacting the app company (I doubt they can do much like provide your 12-24 seed).
Try and delete the malware bytes app as it could be stopping you from opening it.

You can recover your wallet if you have the 12-24 word seed. Only delete your app if you have this to recover. I would recommend seeing if there is an update for that app on your phone (Google play store or App Store) That could be bugging it out.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:33:23
So did you manage to move your Bitcoin to another address? If so, why do you need to recover this wallet?
@_date: 2018-07-20 10:45:35
Set up the hardware wallet so you know the process, and show her the process as well. Give her the 12-24 word seed written on a piece of paper and store it somewhere very safe (do NOT put the 24 word seed on a computer). It is quite simple to use if you show her a simple way of doing it.

My bad, you're right. It's not the CBoE.
 "In the latest edition of the [Federal Register]( the SEC explains that it is postponing any decision over the possible approval of ETF proposals filed by Direxion Investments in January – one of which is directly related to bitcoin's price and four of which are based on the cryptocurrency's price movements. "  THIS IS FUD
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:43:00
So won’t this continue till they’ve all been mined seeing as bitcoin is scarce?
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:33:45
CBoE has a better chance of being approved, I think  VanEck and SolidX will be rejected next month and CBoE will be approved in Sept.

@_date: 2017-05-17 07:02:20
Yes correct, you can buy another trezor and recover the bitcoins from your old trezor using the 24 word seed. I would recommend to google more into hardware wallets and maybe watch some videos, it will help with understanding more. I'm still new into this too but that's all I know

@_date: 2017-05-12 19:24:23
I don't see how this is good for Bitcoin. Can someone explain? All I see is the price dipping?
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:49:07
Maybe it's a phishing email, check to see if the email address is authentic and don't click on any links. Report this to their company 
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:44:34
That's the answer I was hoping hear haha. So pretty much, the government can ban crypto, create their own version but people will still use Bitcoin anonymously because it's better and they pay less fees? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:12:36
Ledger support BIP148

What's the app called
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:32:40
I've used LBC twice and I'm only 2 months into my bitcoin journey, it's been great so far. 
Never used the ATM but it should be interesting to see.
I'd recommend to look into localbitcoins for your own peace of mind and just do your due diligence when choosing a seller. 
Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:14:10
Yes, if you don't. Tell him I will

I've had my BTC stored in a hardware wallet, I've got my seed secure as well as set up a pin code. I'm planning to hodl my BTC for the foreseeable future, is it best to leave them all in one hardware wallet? Thanks for your input 
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:56:41
So technically, if the ledger nano s isn't plugged into your machine, it's a cold storage wallet as it can't be powered on unless it has the USB to power it? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:34:58
How will it push the price up? The price is dipping? Can you explain more please why you think this is good for BTC?
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:57:11
Great! Thank you
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:38:54
This is won't be the last, but I believe Bitcoin will survive through all the bad press. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:46:05
Good thinking (splitting the seed up) thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:08:34
Go for it then. Only risk what you're willing to lose, if you believe in the vision, you should go for it
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:40:25
But if they create another currency, I'm assuming the tax will be higher and fees will be higher for that particular cryptocurrency.  Why would people adopt the crypto that the government have created when they can just use Bitcoin as they can't stop that anyway? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:25:56
I don't see how this is good for Bitcoin. Can someone explain? All I see is the price dipping?
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:06:14
To be honest, no one can tell the future. If Bitcoin rises to 10k next year, wouldn't you think that the price right now would be a good time to buy? I believe, if you're looking to buy to hold for the long term future, right now is a good time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:51:58
Thanks for your message. If I was to sell them in 10 years, would it cause issues selling them to an exchange like Coinbase? Thanks

Look into the vision of Bitcoin and I think that will help more in making decisions for the future 
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:20:25
Localbitcoins.com - make sure you choose the right seller based on feedback and how long they've been around on the site. 
There's a new ATM opened in Leicester Square tube station which is interesting 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:34:51
What do you mean
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:20:25
If you're planning to buy bitcoins and to hold for the long term future, just buy now.
No point getting into BTC if you want to buy to sell quickly, as it's very volatile and not worth the risk. Up to you at the end of the day 
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:45:07
Hardware wallet is the way to go

It can break like anything, but the 24 word seed is the key that will recover your bitcoins if you buy a replacement one

Ok, so how long does the BIP 141 need to stay at 100% for? August 1st? Thanks for your time.

Debit card
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:18:59
They only want bitcoin because they can't get caught, not because they love Bitcoin. It's bad press and doesn't look good on Bitcoin but I believe it will change and BTC will rise above it all
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:00:29
Buy a Ledger Nano S or Trezzor
You can buy from localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:44:44
Yes they've every good. I've had mine for a month, no regrets

The seed is the 24 random words

Will the price of my Bitcoin devalue if I hodl and don't upgrade firmware on my Nano S? 
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:03:24

Is the ledger nano s considered as cold storage or hardware storage?

Have you tried calling their customer service department?

A quick question,
I am a hodler and I intend to hold for a number of years, I am simply a user and not a miner. I hold my BTC on my Ledger Nano S. Do I need to run a full node as a user? What steps do I need to take in order to keep my BTC safe before August 1st?  Thanks
@_date: 2019-05-09 11:41:36
Moon boots!

ETH, LTC, XMR? All garbage? lol
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:14:08
[localbitcoins.com]( very good way to buy anonymously, bank transfer or meet someone who will sell for cash. 
just make sure you find a reputable seller
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:13:05
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:06:09
Bitcoin will be the last of our worries if there is no power, and if they cut off the internet just because of Bitcoin it will cause some sort of revolution against the governments because many people will die in hospitals without electricity monitoring their health.
@_date: 2019-05-21 09:32:32
I'm quite jealous I didn't have that dream
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:21:05
I intend to hold for 5 years and cash out after that. Do I still need to run a full node as a user? Can you send me a link on where to find more info on how to do this please?
Thank you 
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:26:29
Why don't you just write it down on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere safe in your home?
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:15:26
yes you can buy instantly from a seller who is online, you just need to do a few verification steps with the seller which can take 15 min

Buy a ledger nano S and write down the 24 word seed and transfer funds there - better than a paper wallet especially if the child is 6 years old, it will last longer than a piece of paper.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:08:57
Put them on a hardware wallet like Trezzor or Ledger Nano S. It will save you from stress if you get hacked (which is always likely if it's on a laptop) 
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:52:00
Yes, you will be able to recover your ledger wallet on another device. I haven't used GreenAddress before though FYI
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:08:36
Yes! 0.4 btc might not be worth a lot now, but it will be someday, 100 btc at one point was worth nothing, now look at the value of 100 btc. Only sell if you cannot afford to eat/live. Only invest what you're willing to lose
@_date: 2019-05-07 10:07:14
its blockchain.com , its one of the most used blockchain explorers - i don't get your point?
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:36:13
Yeah mate just give them a call, they won't take it seriously via email even though they should. They can't escape you when you get on the phone with them though as all calls are recorded

It depends how you look at it - if you're buying now when 73% of people aren't, then you'll be ahead of the game when they all jump in

Why not?

Ouch 
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:02:09
 
If you are thinking about buying bitcoin, ask yourself the following:
Do you think that the price of bitcoin right now is as high as it will ever go?  
Do you think this is the peak of bitcoin, and it will only ever go down from here? Do you think we will look back on May 2019 as the peak of bitcoin?
If you answer 'yes', then don't buy any.  
If you answer 'no', then I think you know what to do.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:10:51
I would probably sell a small amount depending on if you need the money badly, if you ever want to sell the majority of your coins at least have 10% kept or keep minimum 10btc.
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:38:37
Put your BTC on a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S

Thanks for your reply. What companies build blockchains? 
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:20:03
They most likely will reiterate what they've been saying on the email trail but if you refuse to hang up until they figure it out then I'm sure they will handle it over the phone, especially because you've been waiting for 2 months. I'd recommend calling them, you never know
