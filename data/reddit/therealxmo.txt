$3 fee, shoot! but still seems like a pretty good solution

Eh, lots of toms. Should be ok!!

I mean yeah his name is Tom and I’m 27 years old so that’s what he is saved as in my phone. I text him plenty but dragged the convo down to only include this part for privacy’s sake.

Fees or no?
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:35:46
I just have that in my phone for some reason. In person and in texts I would call him Dad!

Also to be clear my dad has always been supportive of my interest in bitcoin. He’s bought me a sweatshirt and asks me about it all the time.
He just didn’t want to invest his hard earned personal $$... until now!!

Lol dude I just dragged up so this was the only part of the conversation you saw. I text him all the time!!

Coinbase regular? Those fees are usually huge. Thanks though, I'll look further into it!

Some context - the book is Digital Gold. 
Gripping narrative about the origin of Bitcoin and always the first book I recommend to those looking to learn more!

Digital Gold

I've gotten that response multiple times.
"Uhhhh ever heard of the Tulip craze?! Bitcoin is like that - a made up bubble."
Dude, Bitcoins aren't flowers and this isn't the early 1600s. Get with the times and realize it could be digital gold we have on our hands here.
