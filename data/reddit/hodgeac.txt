I agree. The whole thing is really off-putting. Okay fine, you don't like that dwolla changed some policy without telling you. Then protect yourself. Change your policy as well. That's fine. But to make it retro active for 31 days (seems arbitrary to me) is bogus. 
I opened my account there because they seemed to take security seriously. They also seemed to take the Feds seriously and offer a KYC process before allowing large transactions. I took the time to go through the process. In fact I only created a dwolla account to fund my campbx account because they appear to be the preferred method (listed first option on campbx, lowest fees, etc.). Now this BS...Sigh.

CampBX doesn't require photo ID but they offer an optional KYC process that drastically ups your daily limits.
Link that explains KYC for people that don't know what that is:
Anyway, I was really high on CampBX until this announcement. We'll see how it all pans out but I thought people might be interested to know this was happening.

Thanks for the update Keyur. I'm looking forward to tomorrows statement.

Sure. In my opinion, its good that they're letting us know about these changes (hm, why didn't I get any notification from dwolla?), but the way they're delivering the information is lackluster at best. Bottom line is that this announcement isn't clear but has huge implications. That's a recipe for customer uncertainty. :(

You can fund your CampBX account via other methods than dwolla...Just sayin'.

We talked about this yesterday and I got a rep from CampBX to give us an update in thread.

It's ambiguous. But, it seems to imply that this is just for withdrawals to dwolla. The weird thing is, if you:  
1. opened your account in the last 31 days  
2. funded your account with funds via dwolla  
3. buy and trade some BTC  
4. attempt to transfer your funds (BTC or USD) out of your campbx account to ANYWHERE ELSE VIA ANY METHOD...  
It would appear you would still have to wait 31 days to get your funds (BTC/USD/Whatever).

Alright everybody. Looks like we'll have a rep from CampBX coming to chime in on this thread and give us some more information on the new policy soon.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:30:42
None of us are sure exactly what this announcement means. If taken at face value, it does indeed mean that you will not be allowed to withdraw your BTC until the 31st day.  
It's unclear again if that means 31st day after the request to withdraw or 31st day after your account was opened with CampBX.  
In all honesty, either way sucks. I don't want artificial limits on what I can do with MY BTC.

That's what I thought too. I'm not going to be recommending it anymore though after the news from their twitter feed yesterday. We're talking about it here:

Who benefits? I don't see CampBX or Dwolla benefiting from a devalued BTC.

Scant official details available but there is a bit more information on their facebook page.
"Dwolla have changed their security policy for the sole reason of reducing their helpdesk ticket volume, while increasing our risk ten-fold. And the worst part is that we were not notified of this change in advance. 
Working with Dwolla has been an exercise in patience for us, with undocumented API changes, feature removals, and two major bugs."
"New accounts that use Dwolla. New is defined as less than 31 days old."
So, if (like me) you signed up in the last couple of weeks and fund your account with dwolla, it appears you will be impacted by this "wait" period. Unclear exactly but that's how it appears.
