bitmex always wins....

This comment must get said multiple times a day on this sub, your tiring. 
Your wrong, not everyone DOES see Bitcoin as an investment. There are many many many people into BTC for the tech, so why not give us some hard facts about how many people are in BTC as an investment compared to for the tech. But in reality you can't give any figures because its impossible to know. 
Stop acting like an angry HODLer.

this GIF got ruined by this type of behaviour a long time ago!!!
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:39:53
Shame this same 1% runs the world. LMAO
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:20:38
I feel ya! It a very clear signal the near is now! I also remember when I had a British GF!
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:42:17
Relationship is clearly over the mother isn't sending an x back.

people sleeping on Tesla 1000% gain stock price SOON!
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:38:44
If you send me 1 full BTC over the amount you want your friend to receive I will send BTC anywhere for you!
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:37:54
I honestly can't see a flaw in this plan. YOU should definitely do this!
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:19:21
He can send me BTC. (doesn't mean I am gonna send any back :))

Germany is going into a long recession soon.
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:57:18
I read this as 1,140 Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:42:16
I feel these types of posts make people care, when they didn't before.
It sounds like you care quite a lot about the price drop, enough to write a post about it. Real OG's don't even notice a price drops like this.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:51:15
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:42:34
I'm more interested in the buyers who are sweeping up with these weak handed sellers. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:44:06
so true this
debt = system of control 
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:50:57
You can buy it in almost every convenience shop today, 'Thursday'. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:49:43
The new Gemini App is another choice for the 'average joe'
Its real nice looking and easy to use
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:49:31
They need a lot of organisation and support for this to be effective at all. Lets hope they find it! 
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:31:43
Because bank managers need to eat as well. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:47:25
That first sentence is very very confusing for newbies. Almost makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:43:01
Wow! "It’s amazing you still exist". I could say the same about your shitty newspaper the guardian. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:50:21
You are a complete idiot. Please DYOR better.
 Ashburn (Virgina) is home to a HUGE data centre which hosts millions of websites! 
These IP's you have 'looked up' are simply data centre IP's hosting millions of websites, content and data. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:48:23
Are they? Only in your country maybe. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:39:01
It a free market stop being so overwhelmed and surprised this market can move down.
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:23:45
1k Bitcoin incoming, very soon. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:41:04
or just dont look at the price!
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:42:31
this literally means nothing right now. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:45:45
130k USD seems a bit steep. Your turnover must be huge!
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:47:03
That comment about Oxford &amp; Cambridge is hilarious!
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:41:40
This is amazing. Had to go to the shop to buy my own! Its funny because most people just have no idea haha.
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:38:17
Facebook is a complete minefield for most advertisers these days. Facebook needs to be boycotted. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:36:21
Neither of those outcomes are remotely viable. In 10 years 1 Bitcoin will be worth $2,371.12
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:53:10
I believe the ad is being more of a meme. Of course 90% of readers will have no idea. To me it just makes it funnier. Since 99% of 'The Times' readers are all invested in paper worthless assets. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:06:37
Funny. But lacks the depth and meaning I like to see in a meme.
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:54:39
I also have respect for the editor for running both. Looking at the guardian today, their headline on BTC's b'day was "how does bitcoin still exist" lol.
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:38:46
The issue is you can get your ads denied or your account banned for vague reasons, even for legit businesses. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:41:47
It looks like someone just threw together this screen as an app and then are testing it on the phone.  I highly doubt this is even remotely legit. Just some spammy android dev. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:35:51
$2800 here we come, them $1000
Dreams are being made people.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:41:05
This price is action is what BTC needs but not what it deserves.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:36:28
also stop flapping over the price increases its cringey
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:14:07
that 0.018 looks like a huge payday
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:49:51
Do wallet addresses ever get destroyed though? Clearly the number is only going to go up. 
The same people could just create a second wallet address and double the number, yet adoption has remained stationary. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:52:44
These levels seem sensible
@_date: 2018-12-04 12:36:13
I've gotta screenshot some of these quotes for future reference, they are hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 13:53:01
Not complete shit, you can still buy BTC with zero fees. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:50:31
$2600 is an absolute given, it always has been. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:03:00
State oppression in the west is growing, taxes are growing. I choose to NOT participate in this broken financial system anymore. So I buy BTC. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:24:16
Exactly, they can pay me 0% interest on savings, yet take 20% interest on credit. haha what a scam. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:23:24
Yeah, this is a completely flawed measurement of adoption. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 09:32:04
You should take a stand to this outrageous practice. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:26:04
Awesome decision!
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:54:21
Another 'going to zero' prediction. Keep them coming. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:54:55
Maybe he pays a weekly fee for an actual card machine? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:22:38
You only pay no fee, if you bank transfer money and then buy your BTC as a limit order. Buying with CC has massive fees. But it still offers free buys if you know how. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:50:35
This post is absolutely undeniably pathetic. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:01:49
It can be argued, he deserves to be where he is right now, but the length of time given to him is simply unjust. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 13:00:33
"The likes of bitcoin may well be worthless". I'm pretty sure $3500 is far from worthless. What absolute garbage. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:28:51
$1500 floor, confirmed!
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:08:28
Two brothers from Chicago who ran drug trafficking operations in NYC netted $227 million for the drug cartels. They got 14 years each. 
Ross got two life sentences. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:57:23
Their affiliate web page clearly states 'You earn 20% commission on the LocalBitcoins.com trading fees '.
If their fee is 1% you earn 20% of that. They are not scamming or cheating anyone. 
Of course you dont get 20% of the purchase value, come on!
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:04:41
No privacy, ultimate control on how you spend YOUR own money. Its crazy!!! 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:28:33
$150 bucks? What you gonna buy with that? a chocolate bar?
Stick it out!!
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:00:05
People have been saying this since 2015. Of course were heading &amp; due for a crash whether it be in 1 month or 100 years nobody knows. 
You can follow, 'were heading for a crash' until you die. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:47:18
No one ever really knows anything
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:56:51
Pre-owned or second hand? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:12:23
Yep. You better push your numbers up to get into that exclusive club!
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:48:37
Revolut held thousands of my $$$ without explanation, shady as hell. Their support is also shocking. Stay away!
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:02:46
At $2500 will start to buy again. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:48:04
Depends how much your in it. I wouldn't mind if my $10 worth of Bitcoin dropped either. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:23:32
this is weak attempt at Paypal trying to stay relevant in this new world. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 09:31:05
How much debt did the commercial banks hand out today. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:59:18
Gemini just released a nice app aswell. Buy the real thing only!
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:49:39
Supply and demand, basic economics. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:30:12
There is alot of these posts? Is the bottom in? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:09:25
I removed my credit line at my bank, and they suddenly wanted to know absolutely every detail about me. They made it so hard to remove my credit. They just simply wanted me to use it, so they could make even more money!
Banks are horrific and people need to wake up. No privacy, no control and fees for days.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:21:52
We need those 2k prices for this to be complete. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:47:15
This is school ground  and pathetic. Inappropriate for this sub. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:24:38
You bought at like $150 a coin? Very well held. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:14:38
This answer is what this question deserves!
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:01:08
This is more like it, bring on the $2,500 BTC please.
