Metcalfe's law assumes that the value of each node is equal. That's not true for Bitcoin transactions. Some transactions are more important than others.
This paper ( discusses an interesting alternative scaling model for the value of networks. What do you think about that?

Metcalfe's law intuitively is the value of a network scales with the number of possible connections that you can make. There's no weighting put on different possible connections. All of the possible connections are counted, none are omitted or weighted differently than any other connection. So, it's not exactly that each node is equally valuable, it's that all of the possible connections are counted equally, and so you can think of each node as being no more valuable than any other node in terms of counting the possible connections that are made. Each node contributes the same number of possible connections. I hope that explains it.
Edit: Just added that "each node contributes the same number of possible connections"

I registered a Wells-Fargo visa card that I had laying around. I got a fraud alert on the card on the Wells-Fargo side... :(

He said they're based on open source software, not Linux. That's true. OS X is based on a fork of FreeBSD, which is an open source Unix. The fork is called Darwin and is also open source.
The point he was making was you're technically correct that Unix is not Linux and that OS X is not based on Linux. However, that's irrelevant because OS X is based on open source software, namely FreeBSD. Darwin is a triumph of open source software, just like Linux. Open source software is what matters. The analogy is that the biggest proprietary software vendors now run on open source software just like the biggest banks might run on bitcoin in the future.
Edit for clarification.

You're totally right. I'll edit my response.

A Bitcoin address using OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY is an example of a pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address, and using it actually changes the address. You can't just add a lock to a standard bitcoin payment.
Consider the NewEgg example. If you checkout from NewEgg, they give you a standard pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) address for payment. If you wanted to send bitcoins to that address, and lock them, you'd have to create a new P2SH address, which is just a hash of the lock script. See response below for an example script. The new P2SH address that you created is not the same as the P2PKH address that NewEgg sent you. NewEgg would not recognize that as payment.
It's not really possible to trick somebody into receiving locked bitcoins because the recipient creates the address, and thus the payment conditions, not the payee.
Edit: I was wrong about needing the recipient's public key to form a lock script.

Is this at the CME building?
