Did we already forget that one of bitcoin's main qualities is immutability? 
The fact that a core dev is suggesting this is concerning. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:15:06
This is a terrible idea. Please do not suggest this. Remember that bitcoin's immutability is one of its core benefits. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:39:58
That's a good point. But one thing I was thinking about is that Bitfinex may have made their users whole after Mt.Gox with their own funds, depleting their own storage possibly. The point is we don't know for sure, as these things typically aren't made public.

Wow, I haven't heard their name in ages. Last I heard was that they changed from an exchange to a finance company. But checking their site now it's completely shutdown and their Twitter hasn't been updated since 2014. So either they closed or have a new site/Twitter.

I'm sure they will. It's just a web interface into Coinbase. The buying and selling still happens on Coinbase and they will still use whatever internal tools to monitor transactions.

The problem is it's not a scam or phishing attempt. It's a legit email from Wirex, just terribly written. My guess would be they went into to create the template and sent it by mistake before it was ready.

Trouble? No, but it's possible that it will raise red flags with Coinbase causing you extra headaches and privacy questions.

Title: "United Kingdom Plans to Collect Identities of Bitcoin Wallet Owners"

I'm not familiar with their volume, but usually lower trade volume contributes to higher volatility. Even if their exchange rate is much different than other exchanges, the hard part of arbitrage would be getting your fiat dollars out quickly enough from ANX and sent to another exchange quickly also in order to sell for a profitable difference. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 11:09:18

Not sure yet, from all the info I have it's not clear either how wallets are backed up, but one would only assume that using the wallet seed one would be able to recover funds from a lost wallet using that seed probably through a web interface and reload a new card.

Besides Coinbase, there is Gemini, Circle, Celery, LocalBitcoins, to name a few. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:46:08
There are many honestly. It really depends what you want out of the exchange and where you live (what country). If you are using Coinbase I will assume you live in the US. There are other US based exchanges such as Gemini, Circle and Celery for example. They are all very similar to Coinbase. There are non-US based exchanges too, again, just depends what you are looking for, such as advanced trading features, margin trading, etc. 
You can find other US based exchanges here if you're interested 
@_date: 2015-12-07 00:35:19
I was going to comment the same. An ideal system wouldn't matter the origin language. It would auto detect the language based on geo location and auto translate to local language. Anyone could post in any language and read it in their local language. Obviously there would be settings to show original post language if the reader wanted. :)

We actually track Bitcoin exchanges and wallets. 
Wallets: the number of wallets isn't as high as exchanges surprisingly. There are over 50 Bitcoin wallets globally. There are probably more but since we've had more of a focus on our exchanges list, our wallets list is less. You can see a full list here  
Exchanges: the exchange count is unbelievably high. There are well over 100 exchanges globally. And there are more we have to review too. You can see the full list here 
Please use the search function, it will help you find whatever your looking for.
Example, exchanges just in the US: 
Or maybe wallets in the UK:  
Or a global catch all list by country 
If you have questions, please let me know.

Funny that you posted this. BitBays.com (not bitbay.net) is actually an exchange we have on our radar that we should be publishing a listing for in the next couple of days (it's been busy lately). I never say with full confidence any exchange or wallet service is 100% legit, because at anytime they can run off or exit or pull a Mt.Gox and nobody is really to blame but the service themselves for being deceptive.
In any case, just some preliminary research shows that they are in fact a real company, based in Hong Kong. You can actually read an interview they did with [Forbes last year]( if that helps you any. Also, you can see some of their trades via their [API]( 
Like any exchange or wallet, do your homework, and proceed with caution and eyes wide open. If you are in or around Hong Kong, maybe BitBays makes sense to you. If not, there are [other exchanges in other countries]( that may be closer to home for you.

You can buy them face to face in an in-person trade, or buy them online using an exchange. 
For in-person trades, you can use services such as LocalBitcoins, Paxful, or Mycelium Local Trader as platforms to connect you to people looking to sell bitcoins in your area. 
Or you can sign up for a bitcoin exchange, get verified by tying your bank account to it, and buy bitcoins on their site. The exchange will match your buy order to someone who wants to sell bitcoins. 
If you go with an exchange, you can find many here  or by country here

Hey there! This is why we built [BitcoinX]( to solve the reputation problem for bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin wallets. Far too many people have been duped by unscrupulous services, and we need a better way to warn or recommend others of these websites. 
So we created a service, that keeps track of all the bitcoin exchanges and wallets in the bitcoin landscape, there are literally hundreds. We then provide the tools and resources for the bitcoin community to rate and review them. Think of BitcoinX to be like Yelp, but for exchanges and wallets. 
The community can come together, rate them, so when others go to use *XYZ* service - they can read how others have rated their experience with them, giving them a heads up before they make a choice on if they want to use them or not. 
Check us out. We have already lots of ratings and some reviews, but we need the community to continue to make contributions.

Hey, BitcoinX here - I can tell you that Bitalo is in NO way affiliated with BitcoinX. To further the point, no Bitcoin exchange or wallet is hosting, managing, invested in, or participating in this. We are just a couple of Bitcoin enthusiasts that saw a hole in the market that we wanted to fill. We plan to add more exchanges, more wallets, and let the community rate and comment on these services. As more and more people use the site, it will become more useful to the entire community. Imagine if something like this was around for MtGox? It might have helped some people change their mind and use a more reputable service. If you see a service that you don't like, vote and comment on it. That is what it's for! :)

Edit: apparently Coindesk wrote an article about this over the weekend  
I'm surprised the **new** owner of Mercado Bitcoin kept the name, once the previous owner of the exchange was a scammer who tainted the name.

We've spoken to a few exchanges, and the overall consensus from our conversations have been that this is a security and privacy issue.
I don't know all the ins and outs of it, but some of the concerns we've heard is that it would reveal too much information on how their bitcoins are spent/handled.
The example you use to match the user to the address in the wallet already exists, and some exchanges use this method already cryptographically. As for another way to show total liquidity without publishing the entire cold storage address(es), I'm not sure, but there probably is a way.....

I would think a few cents would be sufficient, but if the service offers additional value, that can raise the price to whatever you think it's worth. I think starting at .0001 would work, as it's a very low value (.06 cents as of now). With the normal tx-fee of .0001, it will go through the network just fine.

If you hover over the rankings, you can see the number of votes there are for each exchange. You can also click into the record, and view the number there too.
As for MtGox, we left it up for historical reasons. Our logic is any exchange can come and go, but we aren't going to remove them, because what if they come back later? It's quite possible MtGox could come back based on the Sunlot proposal, or any other proposal (maybe under another name). The point being, this is where the community needs to come together and rank/comment the exchange/wallet to help others out from making the same mistakes they may have made. Or if the service is fantastic, people should state that as well, which will help sites that provide a good service, to be rewarded with good feedback in a neutral place for anyone to see.
We'll review coinex.pw too, thanks and keep the feedback coming! :)

Hey there, BitcoinX here. Thanks to OP for posting this. In regards to your questions...
1) There is some overlap right now as we build out the data. We need more people to vote! So please, vote away and
2) I thought the same thing, but that's how people are voting. I can't really speak to why, but it's legit. I can say that some other exchanges have been reaching out to us, and I'm pretty sure that they are voting too. That is why the entire community really needs to vote, and help even the keel. Lastly, Blockchain.info is not the *worst* wallet, the worst actually rises to the top of the Worst List; so MtGox is the worst. If you look at the numbers by clicking into the post, you will see the number of votes.

That's credit cards. That's a much different space, as we all know (and why we're here supporting bitcoin). There is no security issue, no info to enter, you send a micro payment and are done.

Well said. There are many "exchanges" as that is a broad word in Bitcoin. Many are actually brokers (that fall under the exchange umbrella), that do the buying and selling for you; they give you a way to enter into Bitcoin. This will be a good step forward for Bitcoin adoption in the US.

Bigger blocks --&gt; more transaction space --&gt; less need for central clearing houses to operate off-chain tx's 
Is 2mb enough to thwart this sort of thinking? Maybe not. There will always be a need for off-chain clearing (i.e. lightning) because it will be faster. But that doesn't mean we should cap max transaction load on the bitcoin blockchain to 1mb and cause unnecessary backlogs and capacity issues.  
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:39:14
Newer exchanges just don't have the market visibility that older (trusted)  and bigger exchanges have. You have to give them time (1-2yrs) to build a customer base and trust. For bigger buys/sells, the older exchanges always win out.

I'm sure they've done some marketing in the past, but it's clear (to me) that they just don't have the same publicity that Coinbase has. CoinXtrader isn't VC funded like Coinbase is ($75m latest round). When you get those kinds of funds, you get tons of marketing and connections that the VC's bring for big media attention.

AlphaPoint makes white label exchanges. Basically they create a framework for anyone to get into the exchange business fairly easily. Then they are part of their 'network'. 
Since the Bitcoin exchange ecosystem is already overly saturated, I don't think this is a good idea. AlphaPoint is creating white label exchanges just to build their network to make it look more appealing. There is no need for this.

Exactly. It's hard to classify every wallet or exchange into single groups, since so many overlap and do different things. Otherwise you end up with many different groups which is harder to understand and make sense of. 
That's why in the end, [at least with us]( we finally just decided on two groupings: Exchanges and Wallets
**Exchanges** are where users can buy, sell, trade bitcoins. Some exchanges could have wallets built into them. 
**Wallets** are where users can send, receive, and store bitcoins.

1) **The obvious**: market trading, which probably accounts for a lot of the bitcoin in exchanges like bitstamp.
2) **The lazy**: these are people that buy on bitstamp but just are too lazy to move their funds off of the site.
3) **The misinformed**: these are folks that think their bitcoins are safe in an exchange, thinking that places like Coinbase and Circle who act as an exchange AND a wallet, are the same as places like Bitstamp.

Swapping crypto is the easy part, and exchanges that are p2p can do this already. The almost impossible thing is to create a p2p exchange that deals in-and-out of fiat. Once you introduce fiat currency, there is a lot of govt regulation in the financial sector. You have to go through third-party banks, etc, which are a point of centralization/failure. 
The best method of staying within the realms of fiat right now is dealing with cash locally with in-person trades.

20 Bitcoin exchanges?
Powers most of the Bitcoin exchanges?
There are over [150 Bitcoin exchanges]( in the world. From localized and very low liquidity exchanges to the big ones we all know about. 
I'm not sure where this article got their talking points (well, I'm pretty sure, it's obvious), but it's all wrong. 
In regards to AlphaPoint, I don't see how creating many exchanges under their single umbrella is advantageous to Bitcoin. Having separate exchanges globally adds to the diversity and decentralization of bitcoin and not a single point of failure. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 01:31:06
When dealing with government money (fiat) there is no true decentralized exchange because fiat is heavily regulated. Only when dealing in crypto-to-crypto can people have true decentralization. 
In-person trading is the only way. Platforms like LocalBitcoins which connect people with each other that can trade with cash is the best P2P exchange.

However we know already what this leads to. Governments do take notice of these situations. Take for example the NYDFS, which you know well about, and how they took examples of MtGox which was an exchange based in Japan (with US users) and took that and used it for regulation in the US. 
There is no doubt that these types of scenarios will cause governments to meddle where they shouldn't be. It's unfortunate because exchanges such as Cryptsy (and a couple others) are giving Bitcoin a terrible name. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:46:07
I'm going to go out on a limb and say if the exchange doesn't specify they have a money transmitters license in xyz-states, that they actually don't have one. It would be pretty advantageous for them to say that they do, plus they could have paid thousands of dollars for it (per state), which gives them explicit permission to be a money transmitter.

You do realize that there are several online wallets that let the users control their funds and have access to their private key. Online wallets aren't inherently bad, they just have less secure environments.

I meant wallets that don't have access to your private key. Multisig where the company holds one key is a different story. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 20:40:02
Any wallet software using BIP44 standard will run into the same 'gap' problem. In summary, if you create over 20 accounts (addresses) and don't use the 20 before it, everything after is ~~lost~~ *unseen* until one of the those 20 addresses get a transaction. 
Example: 
Addresses 1-20, are unused. If you send money to address 21, your wallet software won't see it until addresses 1-20 get a transaction. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:31:54
Check out BitOasis although I'm not sure if they have corporate accounts. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:29:22
Anytime you sell btc for something other than cash, there is a risk. Just imagine you meet someone at the mall to sell them btc. You do the transaction and they give you a gift card for it. You go home, check the gift card and find out it's empty. It's the same thing except Paxful matches buyers to sellers online instead of in person.

@_date: 2016-11-17 13:39:39
For the record I do not support vote abuse. The post you linked to was a rebuttal to the claim that downvoting is censorship. Censorship is when mods [remove] posts because they don't conform to mod opinions and the posts are never seen by the community. This type of shameful behavior happens in this sub every day. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:29:17
I do it every day kind sir! :) 
@_date: 2016-11-17 13:24:54
Thanks for providing zero evidence that mods promote vote abuse, I appreciate that. The linked to post clearly says that downvoting != censorship, which many trolls like to proselytize. 
I find it extremely interesting that you say has terrible moderation and poor behavior when it's been consistently proven over and over that moderators continue to censor and influence discussion based on your own opinions. I'd like to add that all the behavior you state is poor on is seen every day in this sub (typically the opposite opinion but poor nonetheless).

I can confirm that Chinese exchanges have really exploded, but some say their volumes on their books are faked [to an extent]. I can't confirm that though, nobody really knows for sure. But the U.S. exchange market in the same token has grown a lot as well, so it is becoming just as easy to buy in the U.S., however with the over-regulation in the U.S. [fear], even with an abundance of exchanges, it's still harder to buy here vs. other countries due to KYC/AML.

That's correct. Brain Wallet was a generator to take phrases and generate pub/priv Bitcoin keys, that the user could remember the phrases using their brains only - nothing online to access. But apparently at DefCon they may have presented some damning evidence of how to crack these wallets(?). Won't know until the slides are released. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 11:56:50
Part of the argument is that web wallet maintainers are susceptible to attack, and so is your wallet. But the same logic applies to wallet clients. If my machine gets infected with malware, then my wallet could be attacked too. So with that said, wallet clients aren't that safe either without the right security. The most secure wallet is actually an offline/cold storage wallet.

The point is for faster transactions. Services such as Coinbase use off blockchain transactions. All of their transactions happen on their internal ledger, then they broadcast the transactions later (not sure how often) to the Bitcoin blockchain. This enables them to validate transactions on their end without having to wait for miners to verify them. However, this method is less secure.

Also depends on where you live, in case you want to use local currency, etc. But for PayPal, not many exchanges allow it due to risk ([here are some that do]( Doing person-to-person is more likely payment with PayPal. You can use sites like LocalBitcoins or Paxful if you want to go that route.
Credit Cards are more widely accepted, where many exchanges accept it. It's your choice.

You can try purchasing in smaller amounts using local traders on LocalBitcoins, Mycelium, or Paxful. But it would be harder and take longer, and be more risky. The other option is to contact an exchange directly, and ask to buy in bulk. The problem with that would be your bank account (unless they are local and you can do a cash deposit). Another alternative would be to find a trusted member in the community to buy bulk from -- possibly reaching out to Roger Ver or Erik Voorhees might be an option.

To address your comments below.
1) On Alan's post, in his signature it says "Founder and CEO of Armory Technologies, Inc." In addition, I checked your website, news section, Twitter, Facebook, etc, and there haven't been updates for many months (even almost a year in your news section). 
2) Alan also said  “Armory may be revived in the future, but in the short-term the rest of team has to move on without it.” This implies that it's not being developed at this time, and will be revived in the future. His overall statement frankly was kind of confusing, and not very clear on the future of Armory.
3) I saw your update, and glad to see it! I updated the article to include it.
4) Again, I based the article on Alan's original post, which wasn't that clear and frankly wasn't that communicative to the future of Armory. I have updated the article to include your statement. 
5) Again, I did check all available online communication channels for Armory which none have been updated in some time. So all there really is to go off of is Alan's statement. I would really suggest you have your website and Twitter updated too. Best of luck!

The problem [for exchanges] is that the market is flooded with them. We have tracked ~150 Bitcoin exchanges, and there are more popping up every day. White Label exchanges certainly don't help with that. With so much saturation, all these low volume guys are starting to fail.

Right, so that is what was being mentioned, a warrant canary. The exchange would have to maybe post a monthly log of warrants received. So each month in order it would say, no warrant issued. Then if any month is missing and the next month picks back up, you know a warrant was issued.

bits are just small units of computer data (1's and 0's). I guess nobody can difinitively say, but Satoshi talked both about bits and coins in his [whitepaper]( 
Since Bitcoin is the electronic transfer of value (bits) which also solves the double-spend problem, and money (coins) cannot be duplicated, I surmise that Satoshi was able to take all of this into context with the name Bitcoin. 
Satoshi may have also been influenced by Adam Back's Hashcash, where he talked about bits a lot too.

Current KYC/AML laws already exist and Bitcoin exchanges don't need additional regulation on top of that.

Only the top 15 show on the main ranking list. The rest won't show unless it's found through search, filters, etc. I thought about what you said earlier with igot. The conundrum is we are judging them without any proof. A perfect example in my opinion is CampBX. They are another bitcoin exchange with a history of very poor customer service and long withdrawal delays. But are they a scam? Are they not a bitcoin exchange? They are, they just aren't very good at it. The same thing applies to igot. They shouldn't be in this business, but they are.
And actually, this is why our service BitcoinX exists. It's to add some reputational profiles to bitcoin exchanges, and wallets, for users who don't know any better. We provide tools for the community to rate and review them, for others to see. I always say, we're kind of like Yelp, but for Bitcoin. If people don't rate them and review them, well then, it's not helpful. If people see an exchange like igot with very poor ratings and reviews, hopefully they will stay away.

Just one of the advantages of not using a credit card is the risk of fraud. If I give my credit card number to the newspaper, and they are hacked, my credit card data can be stolen and used fraudulently.

Its about 3-5 days, but if they say 7 you shouldn't be surprised if it takes that long. They are very similar to Coinbase in how they operate. You may get it in 4, but there's no guarantee.

It's on a country by country basis, depending on how Bitcoin is treated/accepted. You can start here for example just to get a taste of what countries formally recognize Bitcoin 
Then you would need to check each country's financial authority to see if you need a MSB license (or something like that for that country) or not. 
For the U.S. you have to register with FinCEN, in the UK you have to register with the FCA. In Hong Kong I think it's also FCA. In Australia it's with ASIC, and so on. Probably all major countries have some sort of financial services authority. You may be better off checking out smaller lesser known countries.

Hmm, interesting approach although this could possibly be faked/manipulated as well. The problem is that using a single metric to *rank* a bitcoin exchange (or wallet) won't always work, although that is always the most sought out way to do things as it's easier programmatically. I recently commented in BitcoinMarkets on a post [that was similar to this]( but basically saying that there are too many subjective indicators to actually rank an exchange accurately, overall.

One of the peculiar things about igot is how their company is setup, and when people complain about them it really makes their company structure oddities come to light. 
As far as I know, igot recently moved to Hong Kong, not the UK. Rick Day does live in the US (NY), but igot is in HK with an office in Australia. They still operate banking accounts in AUS so they are still mandated under Australian banking laws. At the very least, if OP complained legally the bank accounts for igot in AUS could be shut down.

Seems to be legit. When CoinMkt was [acquired]( which I wouldn't really call it that, ANX didn't take over operations. They only took over [brand control]( which included the domain.
ANX was probably fully aware of CARL MARK FORCE IV though, as he was clearly a big part of CoinMkt acting as the CCO and was in CoinMkt's pitch decks, which was probably shared with ANX before they "acquired" them. 


employed as a DEA agent, even allowing himself to be featured in CoinMKT's "pitch
decks" to venture capital investors and allowing himself to be listed as CoinMKT's antimoney
laundering and/or compliance officer in order to benefit CoinMKT (a company in
which FORCE had invested)
It seems to be a bit unfortunate publicity for ANX, as they probably had no idea about this (as nobody did) when they decided to work with CoinMkt. ANX also previously acquired [JustCoin]( exchange. 
Edit: after reading [this thread]( and the overall glaring abuse by FORCE at CoinMkt, it's almost inexcusable that CoinMkt wouldn't have measures in place to identify issues like this within their own business. It's an eye opening look into their internal operations, which should bring pause to anyone that is thinking about using CoinMkt.

You can spread your bitcoins across multiple  exchanges and sell them in batches separately. This might lessen your risk a little, provided you trust the exchange(s) you are working with. You can also sell them in smaller batches at a time, instead all at once.

To buy bitcoin, would be on an exchange. LocalBitcoins is great but you pay a premium because it's person to person trading, so it's more private and costs more. Depending on where you live and what country, and what currency you want to buy with, might help determine what exchange to use. If you're in the US, some well known reputable ones are Coinbase, Gemini, and Circle.

This is a terrible precedent to set. I take issue with this statement in particular:


This is not true. One of bitcoin's selling points has never been the guarantee of lost coins thus making other coins more valuable. It's always been something said to happen but not on the basis on why people use bitcoin as a store of value. In addition, what is more concerning is that many people have purchased bitcoin in the early days with the sole intent to *hodl* them, and not use them until much later when they are worth more. The proposition to essentially steal these people's coins because of the fear that someone else could steal them before you is not what anyone wants and should never happen in my opinion.

The bitcoin wallet uses the Glidera API to access the buy/sell functionality of the exchange, and tx's are run through a connected bank account with ACH transfers. Basically, Glidera is running a white label sort of speak, giving wallets the infrastructure to run exchanges directly within their applications with all the benefits of a real exchange (KYC/AML/compliance, etc).

It's the only way unfortunately because of exactly what you said, nobody is publishing MAU's so there is no other metrics to go off of.

There is no confirmation that HitBTC had any breach at all. The problem is that everyone seems to be regurgitating news published by a few news outlets like NewsBTC when the bter.com hack happened.

Not a problem for Bit Trade I guess, because on their FB page a few weeks ago they posted that they are working with a whole bunch of new banks:
* ANZ
* BOQ
* Bendigo Bank
* IMB Building Society
* ING Direct
* ME Bank
* Newcastle Permanent
* People's Choice Credit Union
And don't forget our current suite of banks that you can currently make transfers from:
* Commonwealth Bank
* NAB
* Westpac
* St. George Bank
* SA Bank
* Bank of Melbourne
* Citibank
* Suncorp

You really want your mind to be blown? There are a whole lot more exchanges in the entire bitcoin landscape than you think, just look here  or  
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:03:22
Just use LocalBitcoins and buy with cash. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 23:08:23
Probably. They have one of the lowest ratings in our entire exchange database too

Hi Adam, thanks for responding. A few questions.
* Did you see Mike's response? He [responded]( just do a keyword search on the page for "Re: Adam Back" to find it. :)
* Regarding his response, Mike said he won't attend the workshop. His point is well taken when he says *"If everyone except me ends up agreeing on a way to increase the block size, then I wouldn't have to collaborate on that."* This is true, if everyone (who is everyone?) agrees on X-proposal, it doesn't really matter what he has to say. Given this, and his non-commitment to the workshop, are you going to be reaching out to "everyone" else to make sure they attend and work with others to come to some consensus? Mike spoke for Gavin, but I'd rather you and Gavin speak directly instead of through Mike regarding the workshop. 
* Do you plan on doing an AMA on the bitcoin.com forum or if not on there if you are against it, will you do one on the reddit official AMA? If you did one, sorry if I missed it and this question is irrelevant! :)

A common misconception is that Coinbase is the only US based exchange. There are actually many. You can see a full list here: 
The problem is most will have delays in sending you bitcoins, not because of Bitcoin, but because of fiat currency limitations.

I wouldn't worry too much about it. There are only about [150 more]( :)

For those that don't know, Lin Han aka Freeworm is a dev for the BTER exchange. I don't know much more than that, or if he is actually the "thief" of the BTER bitcoin exchange hack, but, hopefully more news will come soon.

+1 My interpretation is the same as yours. Replacing the existing link referenced all over the Internet with a new "updated" version (written by Satoshi) isn't the right thing to do. Starting a new paper with a new link as an updated version to whatever author they want to attribute it to (that is not Satoshi) is fine.

You neglected to mention that Matonis is a big supporter of Core, is pro-small blocks, etc. so that right there throws a wrench into the theory this is a big vs. small blocks conspiracy. 
Also you left out Joseph Vaughn Perling, an early adopter and cryptographer. 
Also you mentioned MIT but neglected to mention Wladimir also works for them (with Gavin). 
So although all of this plays into the big vs. small blocks, I don't believe it is about that.

They stopped operating in March 
But they never gave any reasons. Something strange happened and they kept it very quite.

Dang, sorry for your loss! There has been some warnings lately, check this post here 
Kraken has been targeted by hackers. If you don't have 2FA on, consider your funds lost. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:09:35


I just read your top comment, I hadn't seen that. So you had 2FA on for funding but not login. That's a strange setup by Kraken in my opinion, not sure why they do it that way. Its so easy to bypass provided that a hacker can login with your credentials.

The list will be longer. There are many exchanges. Some fly under the radar because their volume is smaller.

Something fishy is certainly happening. The issue has been going on since March of this year, read these two articles if you wish:

I find it a bit hard to believe that the issues have been happening since March and SurBitcoin didn't even know their bank account has been "frozen" for five months now?

It would be trivial for the government to get the abnormally high electricity records from the power companies (who primarily are state owned anyways) and seek them out to see what they are using the power for.

It's possible that it's already priced in and right before the halving you may see people begin to dump to maximize results. So it's possible the price could drop, but there are really so many variables to consider that it's nearly impossible to predict with any certainty.
