*Rumor mongering or legit?*
It is no secret that Bitcoin and "alternative currencies " , the criptomonete alternatives based parallel to the official currency , nel'ultimo five years, are now the focus of numerous conversations between lovers and those who toe the Web , in general, on the technology.
After a series of scandals reached the apex of international news , including the relentless pursuit of the mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto mathematician , whose identity has not yet been given certain; and the end of Mt Gox , Bitcoin exchange platform of the Japanese who held more than seventy percent of transactions before the final collapse , finally the time has come for a completely positive news .
**The criptovaluta will in fact be built in the near future , the center of the famous PayPal service . Although until a few weeks ago he had been denied the adoption because of the numerous scandals and instability of their criptovaluta , the giant of the transactions over the Web has announced that soon you will be able to easily take advantage of an option to send / receive that involves the use of Bitcoin .**
Have not yet been given official confirmation, but the environment is saturated with rumors and the actual implementation of the agreement is seen as the final turning point of Bitcoin , to that popularity, especially in Europe, that the criptomoneta goes looking for so time .
The Bitcoin project , therefore , is likely to be favorably accepted by PayPal is that other institutions "big" in the U.S., including the Federal Electoral Commission and the growing number of start-ups are open to donations of criptovalute , accepted with great pleasure.
Of course , we expect that such a solution can put its roots everywhere in the world, with personalized and initiatives designed to achieve a success that will strengthen the local climbing Bitcoin around the planet for the benefit of everyone.
With this move, then very soon there may be a further expansion of this phenomenon that has completely reversed the web. Stay tuned for more updates !

But it turns out the support team for Armory is flat out amazing.
The forethought and thoroughness that has gone into Armory's design is amazing.
I can't express how grateful I am for their help, though I did send a donation their way. :)

Might as well when you consider them gone anyway.

I find it difficult to trust a business that says everything it does is free of charge...even giving away $10 to each new user.
I think they plan on stealing market share from Coinbase and then start adding fees. Or they'll just add fees from the start via a slightly skewed exchange rate, while pretending to be free.

Wow such community.

As far as I'm concerned circle is incredibly sketchy as it stands right now.
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:50:35
Yep, it worked. :)

Forever alone?

Going to have to disagree strongly.
Please see 
Notice "For security purposes, I am considering the online machine untrusted, and I don't want to necessarily trust that the addresses it displays actually belong to me." (e.g. an attacker could manipulate the generated addresses on your online watching-only copy)
I think best practice would be to generate the addresses on both the offline and online machines and make sure they match, even if it is not very convenient.

Thank goodness for Penischopper78.

A different set of addresses from the ones originally generated. If I restore the wallet from the backup again, it will generate the *same* different set.
I've opened a support ticket with Armory support and have sent them all my log files.
Hopefully they can work this out. For now I can say their response time is excellent and I am very appreciative for that.
I perused through my log files a bit and I see something about public and private keys not matching, and a file offset associated with them. I think this may have something to do with it, but the developers would know better than me.

Have you created a watching-only copy to transfer to an online machine? If not, maybe it displays that message by default.
Maybe there's more to it that I'm missing.
Could just be a bug, the developers are quite active on [bitcointalk.org]( if you want to bring it up with them.

The developers make it super easy to use Ubuntu if you choose to do so.
Head to  and click on the Ubuntu symbol and then on "0.91.1 (Offline Bundles)".
There you will see the exact version of Ubuntu to install, along with either the 32 bit or 64 bit version (base this choice on the processor of your offline machine) of the Armory offline bundle.
Don't worry about the tar.gz extension, Ubuntu knows how to handle them for you.
Install Ubuntu on your offline machine, then transfer the tar.gz bundle to the offline Ubuntu machine using a USB and you're all set.

So you HAVE to store your bitcoin on their site? It's not possible to withdraw bitcoin to your own address?
If that's the case this sounds incredibly sketchy, I don't care how much *free* insurance they offer.
