What's the price
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:03:38
30k how much is that
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:13:23
Should I report the losses aswell
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:50:04
Let's say I acutally  lost money that I started with should I even bother reporting
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:23:47
"Manage this item" How many did you sell
@_date: 2019-08-10 06:10:55
So money is shit?
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:03:02
I expected for them not to lock my account and for me to have more bitcoin than i started with
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:43:27
I deposited .44 btc from coinbase. Then I  activated 2fa and soon after that my account was logged out.
@_date: 2019-08-09 20:59:27
I wouldve had .90 bitcoin if it wasn't  for  krakens  shitty support and them locking my account till i contact them for a call.
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:55:10
Wouldve been 2k richer with the shitcoin and bought .2 more btc if it wasnt for kraken ��‍♀️
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:00:02
Not when the shitcoin was going to be listed on cbp and cb
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:56:11
Not my fault that Kraken decided to temporarily disable my account. I could've had .66 if they didnt disable it.
@_date: 2019-08-09 20:49:48
Ask your mom
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:08:34
Dude i used google passwords. 
I tried to reset the password in hope google password was wrong. I did this 3 times it was googles password fault
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:42:35
Dude i had google passwords on it wasnt the password because i logged in earlier
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:55:49
Couldve been .2 more richer
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:24:36
Only did it to buy more btc and it was bound to  pump due to the cbp listing. But Kraken fucked me over
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:41:16
Well it did went up %25 which I was planning to sell at.
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:13:02
Get locked out for no reason and trying to log back in with GOOGLE PASSWORDS= my fault ��
@_date: 2019-08-09 20:55:56
I dont have to worry about taxes because i lost about the same i wouldve got. 
2. Kraken is a shitty exchange with poor securties measures. Fuck them 
3. I wouldve made 5k 
4. It wasnt a shitty play. I wouldve made money if it wasnt for kraken temporarily disable my account and having me contact them to fix.
