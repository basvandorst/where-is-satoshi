Sure. I have a Digital Bitbox, Trezor and Keepkey also. I suppose if I had to only have one, it would be the Keepkey, but I believe in having my stuff on multiple devices and stored in various secure places.  The Nano S is fine if you want to use just that.

Doesnt' really matter, sooner or later.....

I just wish Jimmy Song did the audio version.

Thanks for sharing, that was very brave of you to put yourself out like that.  I have been in the hurt locker and came out okay by myself but next time I will not be to proud to ask for help.

I used to think a passphrase was too much trouble to understand and use correctly.  I see now it is worth the effort.

How about a YouTube video for people like me who need to have this dumbed down a little.  Maybe I a just a little tired right now, but I am having a problem understanding the method to use this.  I supose it comes with instructions that compliment the web instructions?

I have thought about the same thing, I have no idea.  (Please no trolls, this was just for fun.)

No one in 26 minutes? Okay, I will take a stab.  I would like to think that GDAX would not let them do it.  However, if GDAX could do this, and I am sure they have allready reasearched the ramifications of doing so, that business is business, and they would do it. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:08:50
That said, it is anybody's guess what the ramifications would be if GDAX figured it would not affect their business.

Not a bad theory, but a theory, nontheless without evidence.

I have all three.  They all have features I like and dislike.  Why limit yourself?  Just buy one of each.

If you are a Bitcoin maximalist, (Which I am slowly becoming) KeepKey cannot be beat for ease of use purposes.  Digitalbitbox is great if you want Ultra security.  The others are okay as well, I have not used a Nano Blue.

I believe if you never pay it back, then you could only call it a scam after the person responsible for paying for the loan dies, at which point his or her estate is left holding the bag.  Which is fine with me, if he or she is single with no kids.
