I just tried it again two minutes ago to give you a definite answer and everything works fine for me. Maybe it's a different EQI?

Very cool, I still believe that ATMs are one of the biggest ways to bring about true adoption. People who may not even be involved with crypto see them and get curious.

Lol, that's always the case. Most articles just rehash the same points in different words. Nobody knows for sure, just don't buy into the FUD and either hold or sell.

The only real crypto bank that has an actual banking license today is EQI ( They are launching December 1st and people are already lining up to get accounts. I have seen a lot of other supposed attempts at a legitimate bank for crypto but nothing close to EQI.

Excellent point. Down the line there will still be people that keep all of their coin on an exchange, just like there are and still will be people who still keep money under there mattress. I'm looking forward to a legitimate institution.

There's a huge difference between a bank built on the principles of fiat and government regulation and an institution that can hold crypto.

This is definitely an issue. I hope that as we progress with tech like lightning, Bitcoin becomes more "useful" to everyday people and they will be able to set aside some of their prejudices.
