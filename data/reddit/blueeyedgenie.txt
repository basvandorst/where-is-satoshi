Thanks everyone who answered. Gives me peace of mind to know that there is no reason to go looking around for a better way. That said I may try Llowrey's suggestion to see if I get any bites.

I cannot log into Cryptsy right now. When I go there I get a message that says "500 - Internal Server Error"

If you have your private keys, whether in digital form or written on paper or whatever, you can still access your bitcoins - it does not matter that you have deleted your wallet unless that is the only place you have your private keys stored.

OK. So I intended to buy about 30k worth of Bitcoin over the next few days from Coinbase but I live in Hawaii. Now where do I buy that much coin from?

Thanks. I am currently traveling and did not want to sign in to Coinbase over possibly insecure wifi while traveling.

Oh no, I forgot about that. Now I feel like a whore. Well at least I am a comfortable whore who can get access to the value of my cryptos when I need it. Motivates me to look into Xapo and others even more.

My bit pay card has a $3000 a day withdrawal limit.

I got 10 Bitcoins from that site in the early days. Don't remember what I did with them.

I have not researched this much but I love my Bitpay Visa debit card. $25,000 load limit. $3000 a day cash advance limit. Few fees, and the fees it does have are pretty low. I will be looking into the other cards suggested here, my card is great but it could be better.

Back in 2010 I got 10 BTC at 3 for a penny. I stored them in some online wallet or someplace like that. When Bitcoin hit a thousand I desperately searched for those 10 Bitcoin. Never could find them. That $0.03 worth of bitcoin is now worth $35,000.

I don't care what they call it, if the IRS asks me it's not a sale and I haven't sold any Bitcoin unless I've sold it in reality. You can call my kitty cat a dog but that doesn't mean she's going to start barking and chasing cars.

Sage advice. I will continue this approach.

Liquidate $500,000. Invest in diversified real estate loans, @ 8% to 10% interest. That will provide you with a modest income if bitcoin crashes.

Sorry, forgive this old man for being slow understanding how this works, I read the article, but still I am wondering, how do I use BTCPay to replace BitPay?
The way BitPay works for me right now is if I need cash I send bitcoin from a wallet to my BitPay card, then a few seconds later (sometimes it takes a minute or two) I have cash on my bitpay card that I can either spend or go to my bank and get cash (or I can go to an atm if I need money right away and don't mind paying the high fees). So how do I translate bitcoin to cash using BTCPay?

I am in Hawaii, island of Kauai. No bitcoin 
ATMs here.

True enough but getting back to the original post, my point was that they were fungible when they were minted and still retain significant value due to their metal content regardless of numismatic value. They were real money, precious metal with intrinsic value, as well as being fungible the time of minting, a far cry from being merely fiat.

No, I wanted to buy a product that sells out quickly and needed to do either a bitcoin transaction or a bank transfer. The bank transfer takes days, and it is the fourth of July weekend here in the US so we did not have the ability to initiate an international wire until Tuesday, so the best option was bitcoin. Circle saved the day, we were able to get the bitcoin with a debit card.

Gold is the gold standard of fungibility, and silver's not far behind.

Tell her Bitcoin is cheap now.

Great, that's awesome. Circle was quick easy safe and cheap. One problem, it thought my debit card was a credit card and the Circle system wanted to charge me extra fees and would not raise my limit high enough to purchase the Bitcoin I needed, but my wife was able to make a Circle account that recognized that her debit card was indeed a debit card so she did not incur the extra fees and her limit was increased sufficiently to buy the 3 bitcoins we needed.
