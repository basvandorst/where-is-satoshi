Hey, maybe the guy heard of Bigcoin
Much invest, Many bigcoin
@_date: 2014-01-06 05:53:15
That is a great way to respond to someone who takes expressions literally
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:17:01
Ubiq fits the bill as well. Good coin. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:24:26
The US govt. Could start arresting people who hold BTC and this sub would somehow make a case for it being bullish for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:36:04
Hodl'd it!
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:56:25
No proof of that and he was not charged with the offense 
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:31:56
They can be automatically sold via an exchange. There is plenty of liquidity as long as you are selling &lt;~100 coins
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:51:53
thats very true
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:47:50
If they cant figure out how to do it, and Jihan has, then he SHOULD be rewarded for finding the best solution. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:45:13
I get that people dont like asicboost. And it looks like Jihan is trying to preserve it, but why does that seriously matter to people? If there is an economic incentive to having your miners solve a problem more efficiently, then why NOT use it? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:19:51
Thanks for the discussion guys :)
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:52:54
There wont be two parallel chains if most people just accept the deal and go with the forked chain. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:06:11
Yes, and it has a twitter account that posts when ppl get margin called. There were like 50 margin calls today alone. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:16:13
And im just saying if you are selling more than ~100 bitcoins, it will likely effect the price a bit. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:27:13
Thats a very good point. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:51:52
There are some alts that filfil niche use-cases. Anonymous coins, and smart contracts to name a few.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:54:45
China patent? Something tells me that wont hold up very well internationally. You cant patent a solution to a math problem :/ isnt that essentially what asicboost is?
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:46:26
Since there is incentive to solving PoW as efficiently as possible, why dont other asic manufacturers implement something similar?
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:15:20
Its seriously not hard to sell at all. Some exchanges require identity verification, thats the only had part. Fees are super low ~.1% or so as well depending on who you give your business to. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:43:33
I honestly dont understand what is wrong wih the deal they made during consensus. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:16:57
Why wasnt he charged then though 
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:21:50
Lol, have you seen the most recent ico's lately? You cant buy those with cash...
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:00:14
I agree. Sometimes I feel like people don't want to accept a compromise. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:35:46
Terrible waste of electricity
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:05:00
Yeah what a shithole. Hurr durr what if emp
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:26:11
Is it still there?
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:12:40
Forgive my ignorance, but imagine for a moment I figured out the riddle, which I'm assuming the answer to which is a private key, how exactly would I get the funds from the brain wallet to my wallet...  
If you don't mind me asking.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:25:42
Because the chip is too inefficient. Better to pay money to buy bitcoins instead of paying for the electricity to mine them with a phone. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:01:47
This would be an amazing scam. I wish I had thought of it first.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:39:04
It seems like brain wallets would be very susceptible to that. Thanks for the answer!
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:13:55
What bitcoin really needs is an easy way to introduce new people to the currency that can also keep coins safe for the user. Hopefully this is along those lines. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:31:08
And why would any corporation want to wipe out bitcoin, I would think that it would be more worth it to control bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:51:12
But wiping out Bitcoins only COSTS money, no profit to be made there.
