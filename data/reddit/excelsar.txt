It depends if you want actual analysts who think critically or analysts who will agree with your stance that Bitcoin is a solid investment.
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:04:30
Yes, because it will be much better to have a currency that can be destroyed by a 51% attack than something backed by the most stable government in the world.

Because this subreddit is endlessly entertaining. Every day you can read posts that contain one or more of the following:
* inane ramblings that come straight from a thesaurus
* libertarian rants about how taxes=theft
* logical fallacies and rationalization methods
* a complete misunderstanding of the investment banking industry and/or the US Justice Deptartment
* crazy conspiracy theories
* people defending hitmen
* drama

What a dumb question. Maybe they want to hold on to their bitcoins as an investment or an emergency fund. This is the exact mindset that leaves people penniless after losing their job. "Well I have money now, there will be no time in the future that I do not have money, so I might as well spend my money!"
@_date: 2014-09-04 11:56:49

This is irrelevant. Just because someone else didn't get charged for a crime does not give you the right to break the law without being prosecuted.

No, he removed the threads because they were not relevant to that subreddit:

Just like any gift you are taxed at the fair market value if it was over $14,000. Ignore the people who are saying it isn't taxable, they are 15 year-olds who have never paid tax. I would also recommend ignoring libertarians taking a moral stand against tax as they are idealists with no real world experience.
You will need to fill out IRS form 709 to determine what you owe.

Except fraudulent charges due to credit card numbers being stolen are charged back. People who lost thousands of bitcoins to MTG will never see them again.

The crazy thing is this arrest isn't even anti-Bitcoin in the slightest. If anything it shows that Bitcoin is accepted as a currency from the US government's perspective. People here refuse to acknowledge their own insane biases. It probably doesn't help that a majority of posters are libertarian/an-cap and thus cannot help but think any governmental action is a very bad thing.

@_date: 2014-02-25 21:00:46
Well think about it this way:
Let's say you want to walk 10 feet. Every 5 seconds you walk half the distance you have left to travel. This means that at 5s you will have walked 5ft, at 10s you will have walked 7.5ft, at 15s you will have walked 8.75ft, etc. You will never actually reach your destination.
What OP is describing is the exact same scenario and should work just as well.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:15:56
Of all the conspiracy theories to come out of this one is the strangest.

Well then they wouldn't be "coordinating" a sell off. Just face it, the guy made a dubious claim of a conspiracy  with no evidence in order to rationalize a price decrease.

Seriously, these people seem to think it's the consumer's fault if the vendor does not fulfill their side of the transaction. I've used my credit card's chargeback before a few times. Once when I got double charged and the vendor would not refund me and again when a vendor would not let me return an electronic item that simply did not work.
Am I just supposed to suck it up when this happens?

Yes, theft is possible in either option. The difference is in one of the situations you lose all your money and in the other you have the minor inconvenience of notifying your credit card company that there is a fraudulent charge.

Yes, you are taxed on it. You're taxed on any gift, whether it's gold, bitcoins, jewelry, a dog, art, etc. that is worth over $14,000 fair market value.
