Using traders with history is safer. However many traders on mycelium are also on localbitcoins, so you could try looking for them on LBC to see if they have a history there. Mycelium local trader doesn't seem as popular as LBC.

I always thought the electro-chemical etching kit that coinsquare.co sold seemed very simple, cheap and effective (but appears their shop is no longer available). It was just a few sheets of toner transfer paper, some squares of aluminum, and a 9 volt battery with alligator clips and wires. 
You print your QR code or mnemonic onto the transfer paper with a laser printer (it HAS to be a laser printer) using high toner setting or something. Then transfer the toner image to the aluminum by heating it with an iron. You're left with a toner stencil of your QR code on the aluminum. Then you hook the aluminum square up to one lead of the battery (I forgot which one) and put both ends in a saltwater solution (or maybe it was bicarbonate, idk). The electro-chemical reaction etches the expose areas of the aluminum and leaves the areas with toner on them. 
I've done the same thing with regular stamps and ink/embossing powder, but haven't tried their kit yet (I did get one before they closed shop). Toner transfer paper is available online so the method is still viable without their kits.

They weren't SWATed, they just had a search warrant executed. SWATed implies more than that. It only happened once and Purse reimbursed them for their troubles (they have a $10,000 customer guarantee). So yea there is some risk of getting a huge PITA, but the chance is small and it's somewhat managed.

Looks pretty cool. For some reason I like the look of Bitkees (bitkee.com) QR code keychains and dogtags better. 
Coinsquares version (coinsquare.co) is cool because similar to Cryptosteel, you put the QR code on yourself so you never have to share it. I can't justify buying either until my bitcoin savings are at least equal to the value of the wallet... Plus, it turns out that electrochemical etching metal is really easy with some saltwater/vinegar and a cell phone charger, I just need to work on toner transfer stencils. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:16:29
Bitkee has a couple neat products: a little square keychain, a dogtag, and the regular card version. They have steel, aluminum and titanium versions, which is cool because titanium has a REALLY high melting point. 
A company called Lasershark also has their own version. 
One that really caught my eye was the one from 
It's a kit: you print out your own QR code, transfer the stencil using a clothing iron, then connect the electrodes and submerge it in the solution they provide. That way you never have to share your QR code and hope nobody tries to bruteforce your BIP38 someday in the future.
I'm planning to make my own since I've already been messing around with electrochemical etching, I just need to figure out how their printable stencils work... I might try out toner transfer stencils with a copy machine. If you're a DIY'er you may be interested in trying it out too.
There is also this thing, which seems kinda cool:

@_date: 2015-06-15 18:31:09
Indeed. Or, if you've got craft stuff laying around, use alphabet stamps to spell out the mnemonic, stamp it on to some aluminum with some clear ink, dust some embossing powder on it and hit it with a heat gun to form a stencil, then wire it up to an old cell phone charger and submerge it in a salt/vinegar solution. That's kinda how I made [this thing](
I'm gonna try this today actually.

You're missing my point. Do you think they just let people off on conspiracy to commit murder just because nobody actually died? Wrong, there are plenty of cases where cops posed as hitmen and busted people for trying to get someone killed, even if nobody died. My point is if they had any real evidence, they would have brought it to court. They didn't. They probably made it all up to defame him and disrupt the idea that internet drug dealing actually saves lives. That's all speculation, though.

I spent hours on the phone (mostly on hold, eating up my precious cell phone minutes) trying to get them to even recognize my problem. They were just like "yea that's how it works", even though that's not what the wording on their website implies. My fees aren't even overdue yet so hopefully I can hold them off until I can make sure my car makes it to my moms place. Then I'll deal with it. For now I'm writing a letter to the state attorney general regarding ebays deceiving business practices. They at least need to clarify how it works on their site. It appears to be set up to help people like me with no initial money sell and ship things. But then they go and fuck it up like they did and blame me for not understanding how it was going to work when there is no way I could have.

This is how it worked for me basically, different situation though:
I called my bank because ebay charged my account (and overdrew it) for shipping labels even though they said the postage cost will "be taken out of the amount the buyer pays you". Despite what I thought this meant, what it actually means is they charge you for the postage a few days later at any random time they want, several hours after I received the buyers payment and transferred it out of my paypal (but not directly into my bank since wire transfers take several days), or even before the buyers payment has even been released. Both happened to me, one after the other.
I described this deceiving business practice to my bank and they gave less than zero shits. They said since I bought the postage, the charge was justified, even though I had been deceived about the terms. They said I had to take it up with ebay. But I had already spent hours on hold with both paypal and ebay and gotten nowhere.
I have yet to find any information on ebay clarifying why the charges happened differently than they described they would. I thought they had set it up for my convenience, so I could sell things without having any initial money to cover shipping, but I ended up with $160 in overdraft fees. And that's how I learned not to trust ebay, paypal, or key bank (who I thought had turned off my overdrafting "service", but it turns out that doesn't apply to paypals transactions).
I can't wait until push transactions are the standard.

I see USB BlockErupters on ebay for around 7 bucks sometimes. If you end up going through with this you should take off the heatsink and engrave your bitcoin address or keys on the back.

I wondered the same thing and couldn't find much by googling. I asked circle in their chatbox and they said it took 1 business day. It did.
My funds arrived in my bank account the very next business day. Withdrew on a friday, got it on monday. Withdrew on a tuesday, got it wednesday. I didn't even know I could recieve payments TO my debit card, I figured they'd have to do a wire transfer.
I wish paypal would do the same, wire transfers fucking suck. I got majorly screwed recently by overdrawing my bank account when I thought a transfer had already gone through but didn't. In 2014 I shouldn't have to wait 4 days to use my own money.

Not only that, but they have misleading terms. When I sold some items they said the cost of shipping would be taken out of the buyers payment. What they really meant was that I would be charged a couple days later, several hours after I had already withdrawn the buyers funds from paypal to my bank. So they overdrafted my account. How the fuck was I supposed to know I had to leave my funds in paypal and wait to be charged for shipping, I thought the cost had already been taken out of what I received (I didn't check the numbers). 
They went on to charge me for shipping several more times before the buyers payment had even gone through. Between all 3 overdrafts I lost almost $200 bucks. I spent hours on hold with them, and all I did was waste all my cell phone minutes.
NEVER AGAIN. FUCK EBAY, FUCK PAYPAL, and FUCK KEY BANK (who told me I couldn't overdraw my account but didn't mention that auto-deductions and wire transfers still could).

There was a thread about this issue a while back and someone posted a conversation they had with an amazon rep, stating that the wishlist holder could not be held liable if their wishlist item is bought by fraudulent means. I can't verify that but I don't see why he would make it up. It makes sense too.
Amazon supposedly has a very effective fraud detection system, any little red flag will make them call the cardholder to verify the purchase, pretty sure they check the phone number with the cards bank too. So it kinda makes sense that purse.io doesn't have their own fraud detection/verification system, they probably feel it would be redundant, and still not as accurate as Amazons system.

Circle does next day deposits if you use your debit card instead of a wire transfer. Works for me.
@_date: 2014-12-27 07:28:18
Yea but I wonder what it is that takes them so long to check, or is it just because the quota is so big? I figured mine got verified quickly because I messaged them the same day I added it. They didn't even ask me for additional information or a copy of an ID or anything like I've heard from others. So how did they further verify the card? I'd also like to know what their fraud rate is, must be hard to keep it low without the extensive verification some sites have (video call holding your ID, utility bills, etc). 
It sucks that selling bitcoin conveniently (by accepting cards) is so risky. I'd like to think that widespread bitcoin ATM placement will help fill this need eventually, at least for purchasing of small amounts.

Now you're just being a assumptious dick, and you're wrong. They charge me $5 a month "maintenance" fee if I have fewer than 5 transactions a month, something they actually added to the contract a year after I opened the account. Me being too broke to use my card at least 5 times a month isn't because I'm bad at managing money. Not to mention plenty of people pay an ATM fee not only to the 3rd party ATM they're using, but to their own bank for using a 3rd party ATM. I simply do not believe you when you say you "haven't paid a dime", and my assumption is actually based on something.

Maybe I'll pay once they reimburse me $200 for overdrafting my bank account instead of "taking the funds out of the buyers payment" like they said they would (they also charged me before I even received the buyers payment), then I might pay. I literally cannot afford to do otherwise right now, I'm very poor and having enough gas money to get home is more important than my credit score right now.

Using Circle with a debit card you can receive bitcoin and withdraw it as USD, which arrives in your bank the next business day. For me the verification was relatively minimal, no ID or proof of residence, although I know some people get treated differently. And I know some people can't use Circle at all.

You're wrong. When you click the "pay later" button when paying for postage, a prompt appears on the next page saying the cost of postage will "be taken out of the buyers payment when it clears". That's misleading, and there is nothing present clarifying it. What actually happens is, the buyers payment clears on paypal, at which point I (as a newbie seller) was like, cool I'll withdraw it to my bank account. Several hours later on that night, they then charged my paypal account for the postage, but since I already withdrew the paypal funds and of course the wire transfer hadn't been completed yet, there was no money in my bank account and they overdrafted me. Twice. Then a day later they charged me for another shipping label, before that buyers funds had even cleared on paypal at all (I wouldn't have withdrawn them that time), overdrawing me further. There's nothing I can find on the site clarifying what they actually mean when they say it will be taken from the buyers payment. Which it did in fact say.
Edit: Also I asked them why they don't just take the cost of postage out of the payment before (or right after even?) it's released like they imply it will, instead of giving me that period in between to make such a horrible mistake. They didn't have an answer.

Not really. I have been served malicious ads on certain faucets before, but it wasn't the faucet owners fault, just a malvertiser who got a spot in an ad network. Most faucets run off ad revenue. Some claim to struggle to get enough donations to remain functioning, but others probably make a profit. You make half a cent filling out a captcha, they make a few cents off all the ads you see. I initially assumed the captchas users solve were serving some malicious purpose (as 1blockologist said) but it seems most "faucets" or pay-to-click bitcoin sites simply use the captchas to prove to their advertisers that their traffic is legit and not just bots.

Paypal still does the same thing to me on certain sites, flagging my transaction and not letting it through. But circle is taking a much bigger risk by accepting cc's, they've probably already been hit by a decent amount of fraudsters and have had to tighten up their security. I got flagged too but luckily they approved mine after a day, and didn't even ask for ID. Little things like your network not being in the same zip as your card can set them off. 
Sure it sucks for you, but I think in the grander scheme they are trying their best and doing a decent job. Although I really don't see how there are no more options to verify your account, that is kinda lame.

Oh god, he probably did use the same password for his new accounts online banking and stuff. I'll ask him in the morning. Nothing I can find about the case specifically states the hackers got any passwords, but maybe they did and it's not mentioned, or they retrieved his passwords using the other information somehow. I'd be surprised that they didn't change his password to lock him out. I still don't get how they found out about the new account in the first place, unless they're reading his email as well...

But the dispensaries would still want to put the money in a bank account after converting it to fiat, that's the whole point of this problem. And the banks won't let dispensaries hold bank accounts for weed sales. So even if the mycelium or localbitcoin traders were doing bank deposits or whatever, the dispensary would still have a problem. They can't just open an account under one of their names and pretend the huge amounts of money going into it aren't from weed, and they can't lie about it. Legally. I wish I could find a way to make this appealing to dispensaries but I can't find it.

You can "instant" buy on Circle with just a debit card, Coinbase requires a credit card. Also, when you sell on circle (again, with a debit card), you can get your dollar deposit the next business day. Coinbase does wire transfers that take several days. There may be additional fees for using a debit card on circle though, I don't recall. If you only have a debit card, Coinbase is quite slow.

My Circle account (my debit card rather) took a day to get verified. My mothers took several days. Do some people get their cards verified the same day? I'm pretty sure even with Circle, you cannot get bitcoins the same day you sign up, as you have implied.

You think it makes sense to me? That's why I posted it. I don't know how they fuck they did that. 
But he has no idea where these charges came from on his new account, and just last month they discovered the charges on his old account that he closed. I knew it was connected when I found the letter from the DOJ about his identity being stolen. He's having trouble keeping track of this stuff, he didn't even notice the charges on his old account until he got that letter.
And now I recall that we got a call about a payday loan someone tried to take out in his name. He just told them they must have made a mistake but that may have been connected to this too.
I mean, they do have ALL his information (SS, "Assets", drivers license, birth date, etc) I don't see it to be outside the realm of possibilities that they somehow found out about his new account and somehow gained the account and routing number or something. I certainly hope his computer doesn't have spyware on it or something.

Has anyone claimed to actually have proof of coinbase looking past the address they actually send to/receive from to see where the coins came from/went to beyond that?

I'm going to assume that's sarcasm. However at the very least in this case the broker getting hacked and losing his info wouldn't have resulted in losing personally held private keys. However reusing passwords is some scenarios could lead to losing private keys and is in general a terrible idea.

It's nice to have a Circle account because if I have an emergency and need to liquidate some bitcoin, I can have dollars in my bank account the next day. It makes holding bitcoin just a little bit less stressful.

My fathers mortgage broker got hacked and his identity was stolen. Somehow the hackers got caught and sentenced and the DHS notified my father about the case and told him to get new bank accounts, freeze his credit, etc. He didn't, and a year later his bank account got emptied (~$1,500) and someone tried to take out loans in his name. When he disputed the charges the bank argued that the charges were all legitimate and refused to give us any information about the transactions in question (they were all the same check number on his statement??) He never got that money back.

What's the fee on your transaction? There are lots of unconfirmed transactions right now because of a spam attack probably. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:48:57
Yep, the BCH(or BCC, whatever) that you deposit for the trade has to receive 20 confirmations before they will release the BTC from the trade, which is understandable because the hashpower of the Bcash chain is so low that many small BTC miners could 51% attack the bcash chain and reverse transactions. Right at the beginning of the fork, one miner in hong kong began mining 75% of Bcash blocks JUST to advertise his hostel in the coinbase header. 
And what photos? For crypto trades they only require a passport number for US citizens.

Researchers were able to brute force card info without getting them blocked by testing once across many different websites and card processors. It takes 6 seconds to brute force the code on the back of the card. It hasn't actually been seen in the wild, outside of the research these guys did though.

Looks pretty nifty. I like the idea of holding multiple cryptocurrencies on one device, along with other types of private keys. I want an app for this that lets me decrypt PGP messages and read them on the device, so that not only do my keys never leave the offline device but sensitive messages don't either. It'd be more convenient than using a whole laptop as an offline device. Might even be able to hook up my handheld micro-usb keyboard to it.

True quantum computing is likely still a while away. The people with the most money researching it are public companies focusing on legitimate problems to solve. They probably wouldn't be inclined to use it to hack bitcoin, if they had malicious intent they could use it for things that are arguably much worse. Also, if they hacked bitcoin they could really only do so much damage before the problem was noticed and the price crashes. At that point it would probably be obvious someone with a quantum computer was dicking around and people would start pointing fingers, so the reward relative to the risk doesn't seem to weigh out. Also I'm not sure quantum computers can even be used in the way you describe (making a longer chain), from what I've read the main quantum threat vector is in from cracking private keys of addresses that have been spent; bitcoin is actually quantum attack persistent as long as people don't re-use addresses. I can't cite any sources and am just rambling off things I think I've read, so anyone, please correct me if I'm wrong.

GoCelery.com has never given me any problems, ~~but there are no instant purchases~~. Hasn't been to invasive, but they ask basic questions on sign up. They do $10 off your first purchase if you get a referral code. EDIT: They do instant buys after you build a history of transactions with them.

You should be able to regain access to your Coinbase account. When you go to enter the verification code, click "code not working" underneath and you should be able to start the process to reset your two factor verification (it should be as simple as clicking a link in an email they send you). Their support chat could have told you that (although I hear they're slow sometimes). 
Or you could try GoCelery.com, they've been around a while and have always been reliable for me. $3k weekly limit once verified, and I think it goes higher once you have made a few transactions with them. It appears they no longer support adding cards as a payment method (they once did). But if you have a debit card, you should have a bank account number and routing number to go along with it right? They instantly verify your bank account by using your banks website login details (Paypal has the same option through the same service provider) so you don't have to wait for micro-deposits verification. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 08:23:11
They shouldn't have ordered them like that to imply that. Having an offline, dedicated hardware wallet like the Trezor is superior to having Armory on an online computer because the private keys cannot be stolen by malware on the online computer. This article is outdated, Armory isn't included with Tails anymore, Electrum is. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:22:38
I use GoCelery.com, they've been around a while and have never let me down. Like the other guy said, if you have a significant amount, you should invest in a Trezor or Ledger to store them on. You can keep the back-up seed in multiple locations in case you lose it. It's much safer than storing it on a website. I'm not even sure if Circle will let you send bitcoin anymore, since they pivoted away from a bitcoin based business. When I login I don't see any ability to send BTC, but maybe if you still have some left in your account you can (I don't). If you can't figure out how I'd suggest messaging their support, they're usually quick to reply. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:38:00
I recommend anyone considering using this service to do some due diligence first, because it is highly suspect. It seems very similar to other fake scam exchanges that get posted here nonstop, just with other cryptocurrencies added. It doesnt even look like a well made website. The user posting it also appears to be a bought shill account, decent karma but only 6 posts on his account.
@_date: 2016-11-29 08:43:54
Not totally out of the question. I bet you could still make a profit with some kind of equipment at some scale in some location in the US. Find the data and use a mining calculator. Someone on here once posted about their solar powered indoor farm that was designed with 10% extra solar capacity in case some panels fail. Meanwhile they use the extra power for mining because at that point the solar panels are a sunk cost. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:24:02
It doesn't look legit to me. It looks like a rehash of the same scam exchanges that get posted here daily: price always above market rate, marketed on anonymity/no ID verification. And look at the shill comment replying to you, he's got lots of karma but only a few posts showing (it's likely an account that was farmed for karma then sold after the comments were deleted).
Stay clear until you see reputable reviews (not paid articles). 
@_date: 2016-12-16 00:19:56
I don't mean to be rude either, but karma with no comments is an indicator of sketchyness. And you're defending them as if you have a stake in it. 
I don't give out my bank account number to random websites with no real testimonials, and I don't use paypal or skrill, so I won't be testing them out.

Mining doesn't use up nearly as much bandwidth as those other examples though, right?
Interesting though, I was wondering if they'd ever crack down on people who hide tethering from providers. Besides the sheer volume of data, they must be able to check if it is mobile traffic or not. Maybe somehow forcing all of a phones connections through an encrypted VPN so that it couldn't be differentiated would help hide casual over-use...
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:36:45
Even after I convince people to link their bank account, Celery verifies bank accounts using your bank website login info (using the same verification service Paypal uses, sadly they don't have microdeposit verification yet) and the idea of giving a third party their login info stops some people dead in their tracks. Doesn't matter that they probably did the same thing when they made their Paypal account...

I used to have a USB hub full of those heating my dorm room! (along with an 8970M) Even with free electricity, it was a poor investment. I made more profit selling the actual miners on ebay after their value went up (due to BTC going up). 
If you just want it as an educational conversation piece, then go for it! For me the coolest part of mining was being able to demonstrate to others the decentralization of bitcoin. Also I think those Block Erupter heat sinks with the B on them are cool memorabilia, I have one left that I'm going to engrave with a QR code as a cold storage backup.

Well in the situation I was describing, I already had someone convinced of the use cases for bitcoin (...they weren't planning on going shopping with it immediately). What turned them away wasn't that there was no pressing reason to use it, it was that the perceived risk of giving out their bank login info outweighed whatever excitement I managed to generate about bitcoin.
As a side note, you can get some pretty good deals on purse.io using bitcoin. That is, if you trust their $10,000 fraud-free guarantee. So far only one person has had any trouble... but they did get raided :(

Most of the people I've gotten to listen to me about bitcoin were people I gave some bitcoin to. "Free money!" seems to get peoples attention. It's usually just a dollar or two, but sometimes I convince people to spend $5 at GoCelery.com (a bitcoin broker) so they can get $10 for free with my referral link. Nobody hates tripling their money! 
It also helps that the blockchain app is so easy to set up, people seem to initially think it will take time and require personal information like a traditional financial service. Go figure!

Holy shit. I've read about this happening to employees at a business, but I didn't think people would spend time on this sort of attack for a random Mycelium trader. Is it really that easy to social engineer a phone company into switching your number over? The phone companies should own up to this vulnerability and make it harder to dupe their customer service reps. Also, more websites need to utilize U2F for 2FA, or at least G-auth (which has a different but seemingly less usable vulnerability). I use an OnlyKey from crp.to for U2F, G-auth, and username and password filling and always feel way safer than using SMS.

I never bothered trying again after that.
I did read a story on here once from someone who had this same problem, spoke with superiors at paypal and showed them the blockchain proof of the bitcoin going to the users address they sent in the email, and they claimed to have gotten their money back.

Use Qubes OS.

As a matter of fact logging onto your bank through Tor wouldn't just not be useful, it could substantially increase your risks, as the exit node could feed you a fake bank login page if you accept the fake SSL cert or don't realize there isn't any SSL at all.

Apparently somebody has them listed at $35 a piece on ebay. You may as well list them, someone clueless or a collector might want them.

Neat! What kind of Odroid?

Also, see that piece of blue aluminum with a bitcoin logo on it in my book? It's a heatsink from a USB ASICminer. I'm going to electro-etch my BIP38 key into the back of it :)

I got a Coinsquare kit! I haven't tried it yet though because I don't have a laser printer, yet. Inkjet won't work for toner transfer stencils.

An Odroid and a Lapdock might be useful for this. I used to use my U3 with a Motorola Lapdock as a little netbook running Debian Wheezy and I'd use Tor browser on it a lot. [You can see more about that here.]( I don't use Tor on windows machines, and I don't keep bitcoin on windows machines either.

Most people who feel this way don't actually understand anything about bitcoin. It's obvious this guy does't.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:35:00
Don't they claim to still use bitcoin "as a settlement token on the back-end"? So they should still be profiting from their holdings, if that's true. Still pretty lame that they had to change their business model.

My brother makes these studded jackets and stuff. I convinced him to start accepting bitcoin for payment! It's too bad etsy hasn't integrated bitcoin payments yet. The customer just clicks "other" payment method at checkout then he send them his address. At least it's that easy to use even without integration.

Hopefully the fire won't melt my aluminum back up :)

I know it sounds unbelievable but apparently it happens somehow.

That's kinda like what I did!

For how shitty my bank (Key bank) has been in other aspects, I'm surprised they've never done this to me. However I wonder if it varies from branch to branch.

You can make an Altoids tin more water resistant by running a thin bead of silicone around the inside edge of the lid and putting silicone over the inside of the hinge holes. I did this with my Altoid tin survival kit.

It would be cool if some damascus maker could somehow make a network related or circuit looking pattern. I know that stuff is hard to make though.
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:26:56
Source please?
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:42:17
Yea I know it would be impossible the traditional way but I've seen some pretty crazy detailed "damascus" before, I never knew how they made it but thanks to the link you provided now I do! That's pretty cool. Also probably really expensive.
@_date: 2015-02-24 12:49:03
cool source bro.

I used to think banks actually protected people from things like this. But I also learned the hard way that this is just not the case. Recently my fathers bank account was also emptied by hackers after his mortgage broker was hacked and lost his identity information. We also got a call about someone trying to take out a payday loan in his name. We filed a bunch of reports and froze his credit but he has yet to get his ~$1,500 back. Our water almost got shut off because of it. Identity theft sucks.

By using the silk road to buy that watch, can't he be charged with supporting a criminal enterprise? It was my understanding that using the website at all was considered illegal. I remember reading about a silk road vendor in the UK (I think) who was arrested even though he was only selling legal items. I know that US and UK laws differ but I can't imagine us being much more lenient.

I tried selling a bit of coin on ebay once, and first buyer had an unverified paypal, and their only purchase being 5 years old from a womens clothing store. Seemed sketchy to me. I figured it was just trouble and pulled the listing. As soon as I saw the profit margin I knew it was too good to be true.

For weeks? What the hell are the talking with you about? The weather? Just yesterday my friend had a similar problem, they kept telling him that the picture of his ID he was sending them wasn't sharp enough, but no matter how many times he tried they wouldn't accept it.  
I can't think of any instant buy options, but another good site I can recommend is GoCelery. They do wire transfers like Coinbase though, so it takes 5 days to get it. Sadly, the same friend I mentioned before had problems with Celery's verification as well.
@_date: 2015-02-24 13:01:43
There was an ex-FBI agent there with him when he "made the purchase" (if he actually did it at all), but that doesn't mean what he did was *allowed* by law enforcement. I think technically what he did could be considered supporting a criminal enterprise. Also this reminds me of when some guy brought a 30rd AR magazine on TV (in DC) to talk about gun control and people called the cops on him for breaking the very laws he was discussing, hopefully that doesn't happen here.

Just 1 MH/s?... That sounds wrong. Even my last laptops graphics card (8970M) got 400 MH/s.

A fellow in the UK was jailed for selling legal items on the first silk road.

Some people with certain cards have claimed that it works, but most say it does not. You can use Circle with just a debit card (no account and routing number) but their initial verification seem to to usually take a couple days (mine took one day, but that was a while ago, everyone I know who has made one more recently has had to wait a bit longer).
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:17:47
I've learned to be careful about clicking "place purchase" buttons multiple times after receiving an error, on any site. Years ago Net10 wireless overdrew my account $140 because their prompt said "error, please try again" and so I did, again and again.

It adds no credibility in my mind. Funny though, cointelegraph also did an article on this scam (there have been many of these scam sites) but they are perpetuating it.
@_date: 2016-07-21 15:11:56
It is a scam. These sites get posted here regularly, always offering above market price for no reason and "total anonymity". This one actually looks a little more convincing than older ones, with that video of the smiling lady and what not. They usually have shills in here leaving obvious shill comments about how great it is too.

PYC runs a bitcoin ATM in Vermont. Looks like they may be facing some trouble from regulators. I figured it was a matter of time before this happened to ATM operators. Hopefully they'll just do what Texas did and make an MSB licensing exception for this type of bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:55:59
That's disappointing about localbitcoins not taking it seriously. Google still hasn't removed the video yet, so maybe some more people should report it. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:36:36
All of this can happen, just by doing what seems to an average person to be bookmarking a page? Pretty damn clever if you ask me. Thanks for warning others. I just reported their youtube video/channel as a scam and linked to a google search for "safetrader.io scam" as evidence, which brings up reports on multiple websites.
