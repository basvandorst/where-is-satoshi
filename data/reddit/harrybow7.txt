Great news! Thank you

Why would you set up a channel with a hub for micro transactions? When setting up a channel with a hub that has plenty of liquidity would work perfectly fine for large and micro transactions. No need to have a separate hub for both tasks.
But hey, don’t let that stop you from believing in yourself brother.

No, if you have low liquidity then you are just a hurdle for most people moving transactions through, why pointlessly send your money through a low liquidity hub to a large liquidity hub? When you can just go directly through the large liquidity hub. Which will be way more likely to have an open Channel with the person you’re sending the funds to.
Setting up a channel with a hub that has plenty of liquidity would work perfectly fine for large and micro transactions so why use two separate hubs for both individual tasks?
But hey, don’t let that stop you from believing in yourself brother.

To be a hub you need enough liquidity to allow hundreds or potentially thousands of people to channel through you... nobody is gonna stop me, however nobody is going to give me a rather large sum of bitcoin either. 
You have to be rich to act as a large Hub, similar to how you have to be rich to open your own bank. But hey, don’t let that stop you from believing in yourself brother, this isn’t investment advice.

It is slightly concerning that so many people are supporting and investing in an idea that they don’t actually understand. 
I would love to get some more educational posts about the Lightning Network pinned up on this subreddit.

Yeah but since the whole network is counting on low transaction fees, it may not prove to be a great business unless you are a holder of a lot of bitcoin.

It banned exchanges that did not comply and Bitcoin isn’t an ICO

Can someone ELI5 index fund

So you’re talking a load of balls then 
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:57:02
Do you realise why though? 
Bitcoin hasn’t been fixed, it’s just got less transactions 
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:06:42
Robinhood isn’t an exchange though, they can store coins more securely. They also have a lot more to loose because they aren’t fully dependent on cryptocurrencies to make money. 
Believe it or not, most people don’t have a fucking clue about seeds and how to store coins. This will make it very simple for new people to come into crypto.
I’m sorry mate but you’re just wrong, most people haven’t bought crypto yet because they don’t understand how to. Robinhood makes it easy that’s it.

What do I need money for?
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:23:48
I agree

I wonder why such an interesting experience hasn’t made it to the top of r/bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:56:50
Why? Most people claim they’re here for the future and can’t wait to use cryptocurrencies but then at the same time refuse to spend them. Robinhood just forces you to be honest with yourself.
 As long as robin hood stores them in multiple secure wallets then what’s the problem, you have the same chance of losing them as storing them yourself.  In fact most people are retarded so storing them on Robinhood might actually be more secure.

This is just a magnet for idiots, post like this are what caused people to buy in at 19k

Why is it? It’s great for “hodlers”
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:49:27
Why are they been forced to sell bitcoin and where did you get this from?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:43:04
You’re a dickhead
