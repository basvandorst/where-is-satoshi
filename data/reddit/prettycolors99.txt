Man how fun would that be to just start giving away BTC to people
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:58:22
Yeah I have thought about asking my Facebook friends who else is into bitcoin, but I truly doubt anyone is, maybe like 2

Yeah I would probably try and give away a lot to people who live in my town because I live in a poor community, and maybe they could take it and learn more about bitcoin and improve their futures for generations... or at least that would be a good, if it all pans out lol

Ugh, you make me feel old, I think it's more surprising that I'm so old I use the post office all the time and also know how to buy, sell, store, and HODL bitcoin

I literally just put in $130, I'm not tech savvy, at all... but live in a rural town and would be shocked if anyone in my town has even researched bitcoin yet

Congrats!! Im kicking myself now for not investing earlier, for a few years I have put it off because I just didn't have extra money and still don't really, so I need advice.. should I start investing now? Am I too late? I can probably buy $200 a month of some type of cryptocurrency, is that even enough to pay off in the long run? I see you have done well and would love advice! I'm about to have my first child so now I feel like I need to be making some good financial decisions

This is exactly what I did! Wish I would have got in earlier, of course, but thinking I will start adding a $100 every paycheck or so
