So, how does one join such a class action law suit? ;-D

I guess what I am really asking is:
1. Has anyone successfully sued BFL in small claims court for a refund and or damages for lost mining and BTC appreciation?
2. What legal arguments did you use in your suit to win. So that other may sue without re-inventing the wheel.
3. How did you actually collect? Winning is one thing, collecting from a deadbeat company is another.

Unfortunately I was not aware of any criminal histories at the time of my pre-order. Can you post specific information about company founders/employees felonies? I would like to use that in my case.

So what happens when all the coins are gone? 21M seem small since there are over 1Billion people in the world.

I actually did not pay BFL directly. I paid using bitpay payment service, but they have also refused me a refund. I already asked them. Here is their response to my request:

Hi &lt;redacted&gt;,
We require explicit authorization from a merchant prior to releasing funds. You'll need to get in contact with Butterfly Labs (referencing your order number), and if they determine a refund is in order they will then log a refund request with us.
This process is in place to ensure security for both merchants and purchasers.

Fat chance of BFL ever authorizing a refund! I guess you should also avoid using bitpay!

I meant more in terms of mining compensation. Transaction fees? Instead of block rewards?

Could you post a copy of your complaint? That would be useful.

Let try this one more time, since my fist attempt seems to have gone into lala land.
Two questions:
How many bitcoins have been issued so far?
How many bitcoins of the so many millions of coins to ever be issued are left to be mined?
Can anyone give me a an answer or point me where to look?
