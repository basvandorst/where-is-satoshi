That's the dumbest thing I've heard all week
@_date: 2019-08-08 10:10:02
Is that the same feeling i get when i buy a lottery ticket?

It's my birthday today so I bought a bitcoin.  Expect an imminent spike in the price due to this highly significant event

Price action

Not sure if anyone has posted this before, but its gold

Disagree.  The 4hr BTC chart appears to support a reverse head and shoulders formation
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:09:09
Classic bull trap IMHO.....look for 50% retrace to early 9000’s
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:45:14

You are the kind of buyer that bears feed off 
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:07:07
Anyone else see a reverse head and shoulders pattern on the 4hr BTC charts?  Very bullish IMO
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:17:21
Too the moo......oh wait.  Fuck
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:03:58
That ain’t the trend line bro.  Look for a retrace to 8200-8300 and buy some more
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:06:41
Those lookng to buy at the 'bottom'; Never try to buy at the bottom or sell at the top.....this is not the bottom.  The PA needs to gain at least 10% from here before breaking the current trend 
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:09:36
Current prediction - Fibb. retracement of 38.2% (9545) holds and PA continues upwards, breaks short term downtrend.  Buy/Sell at your own risk

That should read 'visability' not viability 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:57:34
I'm not sure the platform would release this information.  I use futures to take long and short positions and I have some viability on the setiment amongst clients, but no hard numbers or stats 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:33:07
Hi all, I've been waiting on the sidelines until this morning.  Purchased at just over 9300.  I see a broader trading range between 9000-12000 that could last for a couple more repetitions before it breaks either way.  
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:31:33
There is definitely many ppl selling the ST downtrend.  Unfortunately, I think you may be correct down to 9k....
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:10:35
Good to know!  Are there any crypto based platforms that allows you to hedge the major coins against fiat?  I know there are platforms that allow you to trade crypto VS crypto, but unfortunately this doesn't help when all coins are being sold off accross the board.
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:27:59
I trade in futures whilst also holding actual coins.  What would you like to know?
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:48:05
haha, yeah I figured in this age of advertising this could sound like a marketing ploy.  I've got no interest in making any money out of it this just thought it could be helpful to other people

Generally speaking, anyone who makes money in a bull market is labeled a genious.  Anyone who loses money in a bear market is labeled an idiot

One thing I have not seen much of here, is discussion about BTC derivatives.  The turning point for BTC, as I see it, was when the authorities approved BTC for derivative trading in December 2017 (link below).  Unfortunately, and fortunately for some, this gave speculators the ability to sell BTC without holding a single coin (also known as short selling).  This happens in stock markets all the time where the price is driven down not by the lack of buyers, but due to the sheer volume of derivative sellers.  You can easily find those stocks that are heavily shorted and it ultimately puts pressure on the sell side driving the price down further.
We are now in April 2018 and BTC is trading at 40% of its all time high.  This is not due to lack of buyers IMHO but simply due to the volume of sellers, specifically on the derivative platform.  Think about it, what better way to make money other than sell an asset that is trading at an all time high as there is large potential for a massive sell off.  This is why we have seen massive sell offs with BTC after periods of large gains such as, $19.5k, $17k and $11k. 
So the price of BTC is largely driven by the volume of short sellers, not the volume of long term buyers (eg; Hodlers).  Now my thoughts are that sellers are running out of steam and there is largely more upside at current prices than there is downside, this could mark a significant change in sentiment.  Not to disregard that prices have also somewhat plateaued around the 6000-6500 mark.
This is either a turning point where those derivative sellers become buyers, or continue to sell knowing that the lower the price goes the more risk there is of potential upside and that short trade being stopped out.  Sideways trading is always a good signal that sentiment may be shifting and yes we had some sideways trading recently (31 March to 11 April) which was followed by a large swing upwards. Long, boring periods of sideways trading is what BTC needs people, the more this occurs the greater the potential for upside and the greater the potential for a return of the bull market that we all are eagerly awaiting. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:37:22
I concur....now is a great time to buy as sentiment has shifted in favour of the buyers.  IMHO of course
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:39:14
I've said it once ill say it again....sentiment has changed people, sentiment has changed.  There is inherently more risk in taking shorts as opposed to longs right now
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:37:03
Woke up feeling bullish, bought 1BTC this morning.....next stop, Lambo dealership.
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:44:04
lol.....obviously not enough words like 'lambo' and 'moon' and 'moon-lambo'
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:49:41
Aww shucks I feel special now
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:18:26
On the 6th April I posted this when BTC was 6700  
I'm now back to claim my gratitude and thanks from you all.  You're welcome 
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:32:52
Of course there is that possibility.....I guess my point was more about derivatives and short sellers and how i beleive the sentiment is shifting.  Anyway thanks for reading i get a bit tired of the same old crap on here 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:02:24
What timescale? 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:11:11
Yes.  Bearish 
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:08:09
Already did@ 8000
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:50:45
Agreed.  I get that Hodlers are excited, but it's waaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy to soon to be planning a trip to the moon
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:29:00
If there is a pump I'm totally claiming it to my 1BTC buy!! 
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:52:45
How many of you here are buying the dips, in the hope of catching the 'bottom'?
