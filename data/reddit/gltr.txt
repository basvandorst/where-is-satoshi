Pro tip:  To add an extra layer of verification in the wake of recent scam attempts (not just TREZOR-based scams), may be a good rule of thumb to cross-check for domains linked from official Twitter pages.

I stopped 20 seconds into the video from the point OP started at, when he said that McKinsey was a law firm.  I can extrapolate the rest from there...

I've thought about this and one of the best things about Laszlo's offer is that over time the price of 2 large Pizza's will basically be Bitcoin's equivalent of the [Big Mac Index](  It works well because Pizza probably won't change way too much over time.  Nice way to measure Bitcoin's progress without having to reference fiat.

Technically I said official, not verified, haha.  Verified accounts still trust a centralized intermediary (Twitter).
I guess what I meant by "official" was accounts that have social proof from other members of your trusted social graph.  It's not full-proof, but the level of complexity rises dramatically if part of your "scam" involves getting Andreas, Roger, a bunch of other Bitcoin executives/companies, and the CEO of TREZOR herself to follow your "fake" account.  Social proofing is one of the values of these mass networks and, though you having lemming effects sometimes, it's a nice heuristic that provides multiple factors (N trusted users you follow validate the account, the account validates the links).

That's not how that works.  Having nearly 30% of your economy's employment come from the public sector means your government is too big.

Hey We actually already have the ball rolling in Thailand with coins.co.th, which offers many of the same core products as our .ph property (we're all the same dev/product team).
We have definitely have grand ambitions in Thailand, but have a lot of work to do.  If you've got any ideas or are looking for ways to collaborate, shoot me a DM or hit me up on Twitter ( we're always looking for ways to make the product better!
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:30:27


Thanks so much for saying that, it works well because Bitcoin is not just a marketing ploy, but the right tool for the job here, which is really what has made us successful thus far.
Can't really discuss relative volume numbers at this point, unfortunately.  Many spies have many eyes.

Nothing in the works (and/or nothing I would discuss publicly on Reddit), though we're partnered with some great companies in Taiwan that allow you to send payments from TW to our local partners in the Philippines.  Tons of collaboration in the Asian Bitcoin ecosystem!

Awesome to see Bitcoin in Amsterdam.
For more context though, we're not a Bitcoin ATM. The integration OP is talking about is actually using Coins.ph to integrate with a local fiat ATM and exchange Bitcoin for local Philippine Pesos directly!

Pretty simple: Alexa, Siri, Cortana, AlphaGo, Watson, et. al can't own bank accounts, but they can own Bitcoin wallets.

No, it's about implying Bitcoin will follow the same curve on faith.  Even though we might believe it will, it's a semi-misleading infographic that takes for granted all the potentially "world-changing" technologies that have failed.  Statistically illiterate homer-ism isn't good for our community.

I mostly ignore news outlets altogether. Primary sources allow you to get your news faster and decide things for yourself, **do two things to stay informed:**
* Follow (and interact with) relevant/credible people on Twitter
* Join the Slack channels of your favorite crypto projects and participate in their communities
