The exchange is live, and has very limited volume. We have signed up some anchor clients, both on the liquidity side and those with existing transactions that are being onboarded at present. These are significant clients for us, so if our exchange does not show any volume at present, that is okay, it will be pretty active in the days to come. Proof of which will be self evident once we do our press release/announcements of our new signups and needless to say, the exchange order book itself.

Thank you for pointing this out. As VP Opts for CoinX, we've been bombarded with requests by people asking us to prove we were the first. Its all there with the regulators and license copies. FYI, Coinsetter is NOT licensed in the US, they are Canadian. no one else has it.

In all fairness, the money transmitter licensing policy in the US, is very, for lack of a better word, skewed. Smallest states are easier to get, 4-6 months. Mid level states like GA, FL, PA, MD, NJ, IL, MA, etc. take 6-12 months. The Big 3, TX, Ny, CA can easily take 1-2 years. So it is a long drawn process getting the licenses. You do with what you have.

tl;dr: Yes.
CoinX is the parent company. CoinXtrader and CoinHub are our two products, so they reside under the umbrella of CoinX.

Regulated implies regulated to do money transmission. As FinCEN has classified bitcoin exchanges as MSB, you need to get a Money Transmitter License from the Regulators (i.e. State Financial Regulator) to operate as an exchange in CA.

You're right. Saying "Hello" here! (Faisal Khan, VP Ops, CoinX).

Hi, our exchange (coinxtrader.com) went live (in beta) on 31st August 2014. It remained in beta till end of December, and now with our new API rolling out, amongst other features, we expect a new release in about a week's time.  We do have ACH, and are adding credit/debit card transactions (that would have to be 3D secure), in addition to this, other alternative funding mechanisms for funding your account, think prepaid value cards, etc.

When you introduce currency, you create another "currency pair". For example if I want to move US Dollars from one city to another, using Bitcoin, I have a USD/BTC currency pair.
However on the flip side, if I have a protocol, within which I can just "encapsulate" a currency (like the USD, Dollar, etc.) then no additional currency pair is created. However, the problem with the latter approach is the uS Dollar is tied to the ledger, the detachment is necessary for it to be able to move as an encapsulated packet anywhere else in the world, else it is always tied down to the ledger (which is what Ripple for example trying to do). 
Hence the dilemma. If you want an agnostic protocol, then the only currency that can ride on it, is one that is "detached" from the banking ledgers. If that cannot be done with the current fiat currencies, then you need to make a new currency (like Bitcoin), which is born detached from the banking ledger system, but has its own ledger system (the Blockchain). Any currency (be it fiat or digital) will have its own ledger. 
Having said this, my article was looking at problems in the cross-border money transfer service. Whether we jump directly on to crypto currencies to solve that or make a protocol that can some how use fiat currencies and move the money about freely, yet at the same time also interact with the banking ledger.

I love bitcoin, more so the protocol value transfer aspect of it, rather than the currency. You're right, I do know bitcoin, but the intent of the article was not to inadvertently reference Bitcoin, but rather, show the problems money has right now, in the existing payment networks.

Not an issue. :)
