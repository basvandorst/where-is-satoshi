I haven't read it cover to cover but it's clear from the first several pages it's about how **incongruous** the IRS's enforcement is with the rest of the Bill of Rights and **how dangerous and antithetical to freedom the IRS's rules are for tax payers**.

Wow, the conspiracy crowd really like to waste time worrying about things that make no sense. Keep in mind that a simple software change can make those ASIC miners instantly obsolete. They would find themselves chasing a moving target. So the government spends this money, over and over again, flooding the network with noise indefinitely just to make repeated, temporary disruptions in crypto-currencies? Why not just take the Internet down or criminalize crypto-coin transactions?
I think you overestimate how much they'll bother with the technology itself. It's cheaper and more effective to go after the flesh and blood human beings than it is to try and play a Sisyphean cryptography game against an amorphous global network.
The most likely scenario is they try to co-opt it for surveillance purposes, but even that will be a limited victory since we can surveil them right back if they do anything on the blockchain.

I think you're conflating forced wealth redistribution with "help". This isn't going to be a constructive discussion if you keep doing that.
People help other people all the time without the state ordering them to. If you can attempt a justification for why it is not only morally legitimate, but economically superior for the government to deploy force (as opposed to *not* doing so) to attack those who have earned something and give it to someone who hasn't, maybe this conversation can go someplace.
I can't guarantee I'll find it persuasive, but at least you'd be arguing honestly instead of leaning on warm fuzzy words to describe such a violent program.
My alternative program is to simply not initiate violence, and look for ways government is initiating other violence and stop it. Knock out enough institutionalized violence and the poor are helped immensely.

A free society *does* choose the rational, net-gain-for-everyone option. That's what free trade *is*. It's just that a free society is not always composed entirely of people who agree with your personal, subjective, value judgments.
Voluntary mutual aid organizations have historically been effective at providing numerous services people look to government for (and frequently get terrible versions of) today. People do like to help each other, and pooling resources to make sure that happens has occurred organically again and again.
Government apologists engage in a terrible conceit when they say that a forced program that only offers a counterfeit version of mutual aid is the best and only way to help your fellow man, and anyone who doesn't want to participate must be a calloused misanthrope who doesn't like "helping people."

You're right about that, it's just that an LP congressperson isn't going to be able to do anything like that, so citing Ron Paul doesn't help persuade me to give money to such a candidate.
Ron Paul had to spend about 40 years giving well-written speeches in front of Congress, which were usually forgotten immediately, before any visible results manifested. In order to be in office that long, he needed the resources of an incumbent party, and satisfy his constituents consistently. A successful LP candidate, even if elected, will get positively destroyed in the next election when the Megaparty takes him seriously as an opponent.
Besides, since we are beginning to be able to afford more capital-intensive strategies, I'd rather those be in the realm of entrepreneurship and technological pioneering. We'll get more bang for our buck designing ways to route around Leviathan than trying to strap a saddle to the beast.

All the major value propositions of bitcoin only make sense if you're trying to operate outside of the traditional banking system, which means only black market customers, black market merchants, the technologically curious and the ideologically inclined are going to get any value out of it.
But that's okay, because that's exactly why bitcoin was invented in the first place. As long as it's good for the above, it's doing its job. World domination can come later when more mature applications and infrastructure are built out. Trying to force it into center stage too early only puts the Eye of Sauron on it while it's still vulnerable. You don't want that.

I'm not sure how this is comparable in any way to the Orwellian renaming of a bureaucracy that **kills people**. I have no doubt the gold market is being "manipulated." But market manipulation is extremely costly. If you keep doing it, you eventually run out of resources. I seriously doubt this is something they were doing on a daily basis, but rather only in scenarios where the prospect of paying out a certain futures contract was even worse than the losses it takes to shove the gold price downward.
If you have gold and wish to sell it, what business is it of anyone else how you spread or compact those orders across time? If this is regarded as an evil thing to do, maybe the exchange they're trading on needs to lay some ground rules for participation.
The gold market manipulation I'm concerned about is the process by which a handful of London banks get together every day and literally price fix the metal every morning. It creates a situation where the "spot price" has very little to do with the real-world price of physical gold.

Stop getting so worked up over what others might think. You can't control this situation.

The press and the general public will understand it or they won't. I honestly don't care and neither should you.
**The honest truth everyone can see but wants to ignore** is that we have no idea whether anyone will ever get their funny money out of Gox. That "exchange" has been detached from reality for months.

You need to understand that Greece getting into "financial trouble" wasn't just something that mysteriously happened. It had a cause. The European Central Bank was a big part of that cause.
The whole point of the Euro in the first place was to let less credit-worthy economies free ride on the credit worthiness of stronger economies. The ECB blessed the Greeks with interest rates lower than they otherwise would have been in a natural market situation. Artificially suppressed interest rates leads to the overconsumption of capital on large-scale projects with dubious likelihood of success. Things look great for a while, until the projects start failing. Then everyone realizes they spent the last 10 years making themselves poor by burning through capital that they should not have. The available capital per worker plunges and then you get riots.
Since problems like this are caused by central bank manipulation in the first place, it cannot be solved by more central bank manipulation.

Gox should be wiped from the bitcoin consciousness not because there's bad news happening right now, but because Gox has been a funhouse/roach motel for far too long. Its usefulness as an exchange has been nil for months. Its place in the list of "exchanges" has been honorary at best. Gox isn't bitcoin and the sooner it dies the better off everyone will be.
You're forgetting that bitcoin represents the dawn of a crypto-anarchic economy, something no one has any experience with. Sorting out the infrastructure needed to maintain a stable long-term trustless, distributed, pseudonymous economy is going to be a contact sport full of risks, losses, and hard lessons learned.
I have great optimism for the future, because in spite of the bleating pro-regulation derps that have climbed aboard the bandwagon this past year, the bleeding-edge developers in this space look for solutions that don't involve trusting central authorities. That's the whole point. Every consumer protection debacle this new world faces presents a new puzzle for these visionaries to solve. And they *are* solving them.

Aye, so there's a need for protective force. Nobody's denying that. If all government was up to was defensive force, there'd probably be no reason for radical libertarians to exist.
Cooperative solutions to social problems come in the form of entrepreneurs building new institutions or tools that bring down costs and raise availability. Or charitable folk spending what they have on the solution because they want the intangible benefits of giving. People follow a leader in the marketplace because it benefits them to do so, and they can opt out at any time.
Government solutions come in the form of prohibitions or forceful redistribution of resources, always needing the threat of violent enforcement. People follow government rulers because harm will come if they don't. You can never opt out.
Do you believe that these two approaches to solving social problems are currently being used in their optimum proportion?

You don't have to be a clairvoyant to read the signals that prices send. The price on Gox being consistently and significantly higher than on competing exchanges was a sign that something was wrong.

It's true though. The United States economy is massive. What happens here affects the whole world. Not that I care out of some sort of 'murican team spirit, it's just the inevitable result of two factors:

I think people forget how the story would be different if Gox was a big banking institution -- which is what it would have to be if we were dealing with Dollars and not bitcoins. First, fractional reserve practices would allow them to give the appearance of solvency for much longer. When that finally reached its limit, backroom deals with government "leaders" would end up sticking the rest of us with the losses so Gox could stay in business.
While I wish it was happening faster, I much prefer what's happening now. The market, after numerous second chances, has convicted Gox of terminal incompetence and is carrying out a brutal sentence.
This nightmare might take a few more months to play out, but I am reasonably sure Gox will disappear by the end. This will be good for everyone.

Probably because the first areas where bitcoin is/will be useful are capital-intensive. It is in international money transfers where bitcoin outperforms the banking establishment by a mile. Whether it's for capital flight or just large international purchases or foreign investment, bitcoin will get your money safely to its destination at a fraction of the cost of traditional banks, and with zero risk of nefarious states intervening to take their pound of flesh. It's literally like being able to teleport gold.
A consistently higher price will make more of those transactions possible.
Once bitcoin can become a general purpose safe-haven asset and a first-class citizen of international trade, its utility for all those other things bitcoiners envision will become more popular.

Don't flatter yourself, you've threatened nothing. I've seen this speculation that bitcoin is a globalist plot to put us all in cages written about before. The people who proffer this theory are always ones who understand maybe half of what they need to know before writing intelligently about it. They also usually have extremely ugly websites full of other bullshit about how the only way to not be a government pawn is to live in a bunker drinking filtered rainwater growing all your own food.
Assuming every single step forward in technology is some plot hatched by rich evil supergeniuses in smoke-filled rooms is a habit Alex Jones has made very popular, but it accomplishes nothing. Not only is it boring as hell, it's inaccurate most of the time and counterproductive to the pursuit of a better future. 
So unless you can point me to something substantial that links bitcoin to the "bad guys" that can also explain the coding style, Satoshi's documented behavior before disappearing, and the rest of the technology's history more logically than the commonly-believed narratives, I'm all ears. Until then you're just a very annoying troll.

The ideology informs the decisions on how the mechanistic process is designed. The design of the process creates an institution that behaves along certain ideological lines.

The Leftists and Neocons alike would be screaming for her head. Only the libertarians would be happy.
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:15:51
Here's my ELI5 version:
Every bitcoin "wallet" is defined by two special numbers. One of them is a "public" key, and the other is a "private" key. **A bitcoin address is a special coded version of that public key.**
Usually hidden from view by your bitcoin app is the private key that goes with that address. Those private keys let you spend any bitcoins sent to the public address.
When you spend, you are using that private key to "sign" a message that goes out to the bitcoin network. Because of that signature, the network knows that the transaction was created by you, the owner of the address, and not an impostor. When the network hears about your transaction, that transaction gets added to the blockchain (stored in duplicate on thousands of computers across the network) and becomes one more entry in the giant public ledger. The blockchain also lets you include a small message with your transaction.
Anything beyond that, such as callback URLs, etc. are extra features unique to Coinbase that merchants sometimes find helpful.

I think lots of us have gotten into it because of the trustless/decentralized nature of bitcoin itself because the corrupt financial system requires trust in un-trustworthy people. But that alone isn't good enough for the general public. It requires too much attention and care.
On the day when everyone's using this as their money, people still won't know the first thing about decentralization, hashing, public/private keys, or even blockchains. Like email it will just be this thing in the ether everyone takes for granted. In the future, the general user probably won't even see addresses, at least not like we see them now.
There will be more hosted wallets using multi-signature addresses, and more use of off-chain transactions.

Saving is not a problem. Wasting capital spending it on the wrong things is. There is a place for institutions that invest on behalf of the saver, but government manipulation of the money supply makes that task like driving on the highway blind. You can go fast all right, but invariably you crash.
Government manipulation of interest rates causes the misallocation of capital into projects that cannot possibly be completed successfully, in which case the banking system only *looks* like it's serving the "allocation of capital" function. In reality it's just destroying capital. That's why people suddenly woke up in 2008 and realized they were building houses nobody would buy.

The fact that so many people seem OK with them scrutinizing and questioning every little thing about us "just in case" is extremely disturbing.
I wager you don't see the injustice either in an income tax system that demands you do the legwork to determine your own tax "obligation", and then forces you to prove your innocence if they decide they disagree.

It does not, but the existence of an off-the-traditional-banking-grid exchange system does open up a competitive market in capital allocation.

History disagrees with you. When people have been free to choose their form of money, without any particular alternative subsidized or enforced by a government, they have overwhelmingly chosen silver, gold, or some combination of both.

Being the biggest miner cannot possibly pay for losing all the advantages that come with a government license to counterfeit.
There are many powerful organizations in the world, and most of them do not sit down together and conspire to conquer the world. Even if mining went entirely into the hands of such entities, there would still be large competing pools of mining power spread across the globe. Even if the worst-case fantasy scenario occurred and a single interest group controlled block mining and managed to exert control over people with it somehow, we just fork the code and create a new coin for the black market to use. Presto, Litecoin now has a purpose.
What purpose is served by controlling the Bitcoin Foundation board? The software does what it does no matter who they are. They're only useful as convenient figureheads for the media to point at.


Sure, a network protocol that *deliberately* short-circuits the traditional sources of power in finance and allows total free trade without borders or permission was invented by a secret government program, and that secret government program left some clueless Japanese-American as its patsy.

I think you underestimate the influence of an unstable currency. It makes division of labor and economic calculation difficult or impossible, which makes everyone poorer *very quickly.* Having multiple currencies available to soften this chaos is a good thing. Even if bitcoin is only there as a slightly-less-unstable alternative it's going to help people. If it isn't advantageous to use, people won't use it. If it is, they will. Time will tell.

It "guarantees" success on the assumption the rest of the network trusts you. The attack provides only a limited benefit of being able to reverse a very recent transaction or get in the way of new blocks being accepted. Altering historical blocks would require exponentially more power. Access to other people's coins remains impossible.
Best case scenario would be maybe if the FBI had a billion dollars to blow on ASICs and wanted to rip somebody off with a single double-spend of the confiscated SilkRoad coins or something. Once they try it, maybe they successfully defraud someone, but the network now has a pretty good idea who the miner is poisoning the chain. Everyone starts ignoring new blocks from that source.
The only reason to sustain attacks like this would be to break the network completely. But then, if that's the goal, there are much cheaper ways to do it. Outlaw the points of contact with the fiat system. Persecute high-profile members of the crypto economy. The only way a government or group of governments might attack the network on its own terms is if they thought they were in an all-out war with it. I'm not ruling out the possibility, but think about how likely that is if the general public is in love with it. Right now they barely understand what it is, but once customers and business owners start realizing how many financial middlemen it cuts out, it's game over for the state.

I still haven't had time to investigate this piece of history (life outside Reddit: it exists!), but since collusion in a market scenario has a high incentive to break from the cartel and win customers, I would expect that in this case, some other form of state interference was preventing competitors from entering the market, or rewarding cartelization. Finding this in the documents of the era is only a matter of time.

Of course it's a social science, human beings are at stake here, which means the ethics of your actions are important, the incentives your actions create are important, so you should stop pretending this is some sterile laboratory where your levers of "policy" are the only determinants of the outcome.
It sounds as if you're insisting that government has powers that can un-destroy wealth, and that's just magical thinking. You should get rid of this superstition.
The boom and the bust of the boom-bust cycle are directly related. If people spend years wasting capital on projects that cannot succeed (this happens readily when interest rates are artificially suppressed by government intervention), the resulting "crash" is just what happens when all that waste becomes impossible to ignore. There is no "policy response" that could possibly undo that damage.

I take it from your silence on the matter that you *do not* see the incongruity the IRS's enforcement tactics have with Western legal tradition.


Here we agree. The Constitution has not stopped government from doing whatever it wants. But interrogation is a form of search. Saying it isn't doesn't stop it from being so.


Certainly it could be. But may I point you to the [Fifth Amendment]( in which no one can be compelled to incriminate themselves or deprived of property without a fair trial. In other words, the person who might be guilty of "laundering" can simply shut their mouth. Where are the enforcers then? A crime needs a complaining party, or at least someone who was hurt. Moving money on its own is not a crime and should not be illegal.
I won't expect you to see the common thread between not having to surrender information, property or privacy to government inquisitors without thorough justification in both the fourth and fifth amendments. Nor will I expect you to see the same principles at work in the rest of the Bill of Rights, for example in the [Third Amendment]( You have made it abundantly clear that you believe -- against the evidence to the contrary -- that your government has the right to do all the things it does do. Furthermore, you are willing to engage in circular reasoning, appeals to authority, and appeals to popularity, to justify that erroneous belief.
As for drama and hyperbole, I was not exaggerating. If people come to believe as you do, that the presumption of innocence isn't actually important, Western civilization would be turning back the clock by almost a thousand years. I don't think you really want to live in a country where you have to prove your innocence, the crimes are arbitrary, and you have no rights against government scrutiny.

It's hard for the consumer to get their needs met when the conflict resolution services (usually monopolized by government) are either non-existent or in cahoots with the misbehaving service providers.
To convict the process of market competition for these crimes, when there are abundant suspects with more violent histories of their own, who you haven't even questioned, sounds pretty biased to me.
* [In the US, there are still hundreds of private firefighting companies.](
* [In Austria, nearly all fire departments are volunteers. Some are even professional organizations or owned by private companies.](
* [In Australia, emergencies are responded to by a wide variety of entirely volunteer organizations.](
* [In Chile, the *Bomberos* are the volunteer firefighters, who are more trusted than the police or the Catholic Church](
"Private" fire teams acting abusively in one extreme example rife with organized violence, does not exactly rule out the notion that peacefully-funded emergency services are preferable.

Bitcoin is trustless, but that doesn't mean you have to be. Those who can scrutinize this thing already are, and the non-technical users will just have to trust their opinion. This isn't going to be a very useful currency if it requires everyone to become a crypto specialist.
As adoption spreads, it won't be just the protocol that prevents theft, but pressure from the market to please users and customers over the long term. Nobody worries that the next release of Debian will contain catastrophic malware.

You tell me. You're the one suggesting this technology is a secret plot to subjugate everyone. So who are they? What do they want? Why have they chosen this method in particular?


No, I've been very specific. You kept suggesting that bitcoin is some sort of economic Trojan horse. I'm insisting on some form of evidence. Anything. One hyperlink. Humor me. Point me to the best case anyone has made for that conclusion, because I've looked and haven't found anything persuasive.
I'm not making an argument. Just looking for a reason to entertain the possibility that bitcoin is something other than what it has looked like the whole time: The first popular solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem. To me the most plausible story about "Satoshi" is that he was simply very paranoid and might have died in the tsunami that hit Japan. I'll confess to not dwelling too much on "Satoshi" himself because the invention can speak for itself. If there is nefarious intent, surely there might be something you can point to in the code that suggests this. Everything I know about the bitcoin protocol can be explained by the intention to mimic gold's scarcity over time and achieve trustless coordination of information. Please tell me what it is about this thing that requires a crack team of patient tyrants at DARPA to explain? You seem so convinced that this is the case that it doesn't need explaining. So explain it like I'm 5.

Constant inflation means your buying power is best leveraged by spending it in the present and discounting the future -- the money will be worth less then anyway. That creates a strong incentive to use debt.

Cool. One thing the IMF and I can agree on. Nation-states have to go. Commerce without borders is a spectacular advancement for humanity.
The Internet and every other technology that originated in government started serving purposes neither the state nor anyone else ever envisioned once escaping into the wild. In every case the pros for human liberty have outweighed the cons once the technology reached the hands of the masses. This is true for guns and printing presses just as much as it is for networking protocols and cryptography. I'd kind of like Satoshi to be Dorian, partially to put this whole phase of mysticism behind us, and partially because I like that it's not the stereotypical young IT nerd everyone imagines.
At the end of the day, the world now knows how to build a trustless and unkillable information coordination system. Whether we're using bitcoin or something else 25 years from now, humanity is going to benefit from this new device more than it will be hurt, no matter who invented it.

One does not need to assume those things to believe bitcoin to have come from minds outside the government, with intentions external to the state. It was constructed out of existing tools and protocols. It is entirely possible -- even likely -- that the inventor had connections to those institutions we normally expect cryptographic research to come out of. But the design of bitcoin and the writings of the author strongly suggest anti-state intentions. Unless that was a carefully crafted psyop too.
This week "Satoshi" posted for the first time in years. I don't know how you interpret that, but it looks to me like an individual or a dishonest sysadmin at the P2P Foundation. If the software was the result of some government team I don't see them giving a damn one way or the other what Newsweek does to some unlucky sod carrying the team's pseudonym.
Since the code is what it is no matter what you believe about the originator, I'm not sure why this is important. There is no benefit in speculating about things you cannot possibly know until someone comes out and proves they are "Satoshi." If you believe something about the protocol to be a huge vulnerability, talk about that. This obsessing over mysterious creators is a waste of energy. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

No, but you could insure customers against loss and theft of bitcoins. I'm surprised there haven't been higher-profile efforts to do this yet.
However, the premiums for covering coins the customer is putting in the hands of a disreputable exchange would be very high.
If I was the insurer, my rates for covering Goxcoins would have been in excess of the nominal amount covered, because loss was virtually guaranteed, and then there's the administrative cost of satisfying the claim.

Some people refuse to believe cryptography can do what cryptography does. I've tried explaining public/private keys before and people seem to dismiss it out of hand. They believe the government has omniscient supercomputers that can crack anything within a day. I'd also wait for questions before getting into bitcoin's monetary policy.
I don't think we should fret too much about the uninitiated not understanding it. People write email without ever hearing about SMTP. When they see it being used for things, it will fall into the same mental category people reserve for Dollars and Euros, and that is "tokens I need in order to buy stuff." They'll exchange for them the same way they do other currencies, and spend them with a smartphone or a card that looks just like their credit card. The inner workings will be completely obfuscated.

I am convinced that if and when bitcoin gets broader acceptance, it will not be because holders of bitcoin begged and pleaded with merchants to take it. Instead, it will be because merchants have seen the success of the hoarders, and want some bitcoin themselves.
Instead of mining/buying and then begging people to take your BTC, start finding ways to produce things people will pay you BTC for. That's how the bitcoin economy grows.

Independently, the concepts are devoid of ideological weight. A blockchain to store transaction data. A distributed network. Proof of work. SHA256. But the way they are combined in bitcoin is inseparable from certain ideological goals.
Why a hard cap of 21M bitcoins? Why halve the block reward every 4 years? Why put the decision on the rate of money production out of human reach at all? Ideology.
There's no point in inventing a leaderless, unforgeable property ledger in the first place unless you don't trust third parties to respect the property rights of individuals. Public-key cryptography has no purpose unless you believe it is important that individual actors are able to solve certain problems alone or one-on-one without involving third party authorities.
There is a direct link between ideology and institutions. Bitcoin is an institution built out of technologies.

In fact, since it's so hard to get one's mind around that "bitcoin could be money" corner, perhaps avoid that altogether and call it a payment network. Payment processors that leverage bitcoin just transform it back to fiat for the client anyway, so it's being used like a digital Western Union.

Funding follows the duoploy. They have their political walled garden and outsiders are simply not admitted. As it was with Ron Paul, the only way someone not already vetted by the Bilderberg/CFR/globalist class is going to get any traction at all towards a major office is with a colossal upswelling of grassroots funding.
A small-government candidate is *never* going to be a "likely winner" from the point of view of the big establishment donors or mainstream political opinion makers. A small-government candidate would be working exactly against the interests of those big establishment donors anyway, so likely winner or not, you're never getting much money from them.
At least one, probably more, of the following would have to happen for an LP candidate to stand more than a snowball's chance in hell of getting elected to a major US office. The list is not exhaustive.
* The candidate waters down the platform so much that establishment money and the greedy pricks who vote find him palatable.
* The candidate runs the best PR campaign since Ronald Reagan, and manages to narrow the debate down to a single issue, to blind the aforementioned greedy pricks from the parts of his platform they would hate.
* Lie to special interest groups to get their money. This will only work once.
* Small-government proponents, many of whom don't even vote anymore, get so rich we can replace the establishment money entirely, and fund that monster marketing campaign mentioned above.
* Some kind of public opinion miracle occurs where the LP is no longer considered a cheap knockoff party for non-serious candidates.

Certainly there are other priorities that come first in Africa.

The biggest problem we have right now regarding theft and fraud is that the government monopoly criminal justice system still doesn't know what the heck to do with bitcoin. I bet most of them still suspect it's some kind of computer game.
It also doesn't help that people make decisions about the government policies they think they want based on emotional reactions to what they see happening in the news. Gox collapses and they think it is some disaster brought on by a lack of government-provided guard rails to the market.
Gox going down so fast is a *benefit* of an unfettered market and a fixed inflation rate. It prevented Gox from continuing the con for years or decades on the taxpayer dime, which is what we see happening in mixed economies all the time. Interventions like that give the impression of stability, when in reality it just makes the instability harder to perceive and the negative effects hurt more people for longer.

It doesn't have to be a conspiracy. The structure of our government is ideal for the results it produces.
Every government agency has a vested interest in growing its power, authority and influence. It means bigger paychecks, bigger staff, and more important-sounding titles. Unfair and inconsistent treatment toward something like bitcoin is "by design" of a sort because the nexus of individual interests composing the state work out to that result and always will.
Since the federal government is in charge of determining what the limits of its own power are, we shouldn't be surprised when they keep discovering more power.

To all the people saying "we" should lobby too, keep in mind that no matter how lobbyists change the government's perception of bitcoin, **there isn't a damn thing they can do to stop it**. Even if they try to outlaw it entirely, bitcoin is creating freedom where there once was none. And it will continue to. This is the bittorrent of free trade.
Expect the bureaucrats to pass laws against it. Expect the bureaucrats to badmouth it in the press. This is not an ideologically neutral technology. Bitcoin only solves a problem if you do not trust the fascist financial system we have today. Broader adoption of bitcoin necessarily means less reliance and less trust in these powerful institutions, who draw their power from your trust, and can only do so due to a lack of alternatives.
Spending money wooing the psychopaths in Washington is a fool's errand. Eventually they will *know* crypto is out to get them, and they will respond to this existential threat the way they respond to any existential threat: with crushing violence.

I'd like to spend some time reading up on that example. But just on the details you've provided here... Isn't it obvious that an extremely, urgently, motivated buyer of a dangerous service is going to end up paying an extremely high price? There is a price at which it's more costly to employ the firefighter than it is to just let it burn down. Of course, if they bid that high, both sides lose.
Catastrophic emergencies are the sort of thing you should be buying insurance for. That way the price negotiation and service agreements happen far away from the emergency situation, and the clout of an insurance broker can amplify the customer's bargaining power. I would venture to guess that in this case you're citing, either insurance of that sort was available and these victims chose not to buy it, or government was getting in the way of that kind of insurance emerging in the marketplace.
Having government subsidized firefighters only guarantees the firefighters are always free. It can't guarantee they will be available or effective, or that the service will ever improve.
The thing with counter-examples like this is virtually every time I go looking for more details, I end up finding state interference that encouraged antisocial behavior. Incentives matter, and government routinely warps incentives.

The almost magical process of savings appreciation under a hard money regime's moderate price deflation is something sound-money advocates need to hammer on every time the subject comes up.

The fundamental principle at play has been a known factor in economics at least since Mises, and the US government chose to tread those waters anyway in 1971. A minority has been sounding the warning bell for 43 years. Unbacked fiat currencies historically never last past their fourth decade but this is a unique situation because the Dollar *is* a first-class currency across the globe. There are a lot of dupes overseas who will absorb some of the damage before it comes home to roost in American households.
Gradually you will see foreigners buy less US debt. But the US gov't can't stop spending. The process is already happening.
The powers that be know this is an inevitability so I expect something other than hyperinflation. There will be plenty of legislative and banking gymnastics to stick the poorest Americans with the bill, but hyperinflation? Probably not.

I wouldn't call them "paymasters" in this case. It's more like the group of people who can scuttle him politically if they want to, ruining his reputation and rendering his office impotent for the rest of his term.
You don't get to be President without paying your respects to the people who actually run the world (google terms like "Bilderberg Group", "Trilateral Commission", "Council on Foreign Relations"). It is these people who select the candidates in the first place. They seem to think of themselves as an untouchable class of humanity; a superior species, even. It is unlikely they promote into political power anyone they can't control. Whether they're motivating him with a carrot (money) or a stick (blackmail), you can count on the POTUS doing whatever this cabal wants.

That's why it's called a risk, silly. Investing is just as much a risk now with fiat. The only difference is that fiat chases capital into investments in spite of most investments not deserving that much buy-in. To be precise, you "have no motivation" until the investment risk has a high enough return and a high enough likelihood of success. All the level of inflation/deflation does is move that threshold. Keep in mind that until 2140 BTC *will* be moderately inflationary. I suspect the economy will grow faster than the money supply though, and that's just fine with me.

I deny that saved money is "stuck." It is being put to use as the holder's insulation against the uncertain future.


Indeed, economies don't even *exist* unless there are transactions. But moderate deflation encourages those transactions to be more carefully considered.
All that said, even if the top cryptocurrency was an inflationary one I would be happy. The deadliest tax we endure is that of government-driven inflation. Just the fact that the currency is not controlled by a cartel is a huge leap forward.

I'd rather say that bitcoin's backing is cryptography and the momentum of the collective humanity running the network.
One of the essential elements of a money is that it is stable -- not in price *per se* -- but stable in its properties. People chose gold once upon a time because if you made a gold coin, it would still be a gold coin centuries later if nobody destroyed it.
What's a bitcoin? It's one out of 21 million units of measure in a cryptographically secured, peer-to-peer supercomputer network with built-in incentives for people to keep the security high and the network fast. I've got no idea what the price will be ten years from now, but unless something catastrophic happens to the idea of bitcoin, I know that a bitcoin then will be exactly what a bitcoin is now. This isn't as good a guarantee as gold, but it's sure as heck better than fiat.
@_date: 2013-04-29 12:48:03
One of the most significant ways modern welfare/warfare nation-states extract wealth from their host populations is through the control of the money supply. Through central banks they are able to profit from being the first ones in line when new money is created. By this mechanism, inflation itself turns out to be a tax. This enriches the government immensely and allows it to do things the people would never be willing to pay for directly.
In a world where bitcoin is the predominant currency, even if taxation and nation-states persist, their power will be severely limited to whatever they can pay for through direct taxation.
Also, the people would have no real need to use the national currency in their day-to-day lives. As a result, the nation-state will find that abusing their own monetary system is less and less rewarding.
@_date: 2013-10-08 02:50:12
Right now there's still not a whole lot of reason for everyday folk to bother with Bitcoin. I tell people about it because it's interesting from a technology point of view but in terms of utility, most people won't get anything out of it right now.
In addition to better techniques for purchasing BTC, I'd like to see the creation of a distributed, trustless marketplace that can go toe-to-toe with eBay by costing less and being as safe (or safer) for buyers and sellers alike. Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door. When entrepreneurs are able to say "I used this BTC-only marketplace and my profits were 50% better than what they would have been on eBay," I think the problem of getting people to use it will solve itself.

Congratulations! I am so happy for everyone who has made so much money off this amazing new technology.
This is one of my favorite aspects of the popularizing of bitcoin. The transfer of wealth into the hands of crypto-geeks, people who distrust concentrated power and are passionate about -- or at least interested in -- decentralization. You are going to make choices with your riches that will be far better for society than those pigs at Goldman Sachs. I wish you the best of luck.

Do those things, and money will never be a worry for you ever again.

In the coming years it will be entertaining to watch the convulsions of the naysayers, who subscribe to terrifically flawed (though popular) economic theories.

Sure, but when considering the price you set, consider how the consumer is going to look at it. The consumer certainly has *both* BTC and USD, and if the price roughly equivalent for both, and BTC is rising, that's actually a *disincentive* to spend the BTC.
If you offer it "at a discount" in BTC, then the consumer is asking themselves: Do I want this product now, or a bitcoin worth an extra $10 later? Some may feel the price is about to go down, or don't want to wait that long.

It's weird to see someone say that, since Linux does hardware detection better than any OS out there.

What really gets in the way is when a given manufacturer refuses to cooperate when it comes to publishing drivers.

Again, absolutely correct. A week ago I was giving Berwick all the credit for this thing because I thought he was the sole investor behind it. This blog post undermines that, so now I'm not sure what the story is.
There are two possible narratives I'm seeing in this thread. One is that Berwick is 100% responsible for puppetmastering the rise and fall of BitcoinATM, purposefully scuttling the business with some mysterious ulterior motive.
The other is that Berwick isn't lying in this blog post, and was hired as a spokesman for a business run by people who were just as foolish or nefarious, and he should have looked more closely before signing on.
Whatever the case may be, his next move regarding Bitcoin is absolutely correct. The ATMs are vulnerabilities. They can be physically attacked by governments. He is smart to target something entirely new and decentralized. Given Berwick's history and other successes, and his accurate analysis of Bitcoin's future, I'm inclined to believe his side of the story.

Sorry, but for success we need to keep bitcoin off the politicos' radar as long as possible. It is a threat to every system they feed on. The banking cartel, the tax grid, all of it depends on forced universal acceptance of the US Dollar. There's a reason the last guy to offer a competing currency in the United States [is in jail right now]( after having committed no crime.
There is no way you are going to be able to control the multi-billion-dollar PR campaign that will be unleashed against BTC the moment the banksters and tax eaters realize what it means. There will come a day when they start arresting careless Bitcoiners for ridiculous things like "tax evasion," "counterfeiting," or "wire fraud." These animals *are not your friends*.

A lot of the recent drive upward seems to have come from Chinese adoption, and those folks don't have a lot of places to put their money. Some financial deregulation in China could drive some money out of BTC but with that I wouldn't expect a price lower than $100.
I think it's more likely we will see an improvement (like more transactions-per-second) sooner than some debilitating software bug.

Price controls on interest rates deceives the market into thinking there's more stored capital than there really is. People take risks, buy things, and take on debts they never would if interest rates were at their more correct, natural market levels. As a result, capital gets consumed or otherwise wasted on projects which have no chance of succeeding.

If you're using BitPay you'd get exactly the USD you wanted.
Right now, the best benefit is drastically lower fees than processing a credit card, and zero risk of fraud or chargebacks. For the customer, perhaps you can offer a discount because of those lower fees.
In the not too distant future, other benefits will include simpler accounting and an escape from a crumbling US Dollar (it's going to happen, it's just a matter of when).
edit: I'd also like to add that from your customer's point of view, this might be the single most convenient payment method they have. Have you ever tried using bitcoin before?

I think this is an instructive reminder. There are many new developments -- either past, current, or coming soon -- that look like they legitimize or promote bitcoin, but in reality open it up to government attack.
Have you ever seen the documentary film *The Corporation*? In it, they analyze the behavior of large corporations as if they were analyzing the behavior of an individual. The conclusion they come to is that if corporations were people, they would be sociopaths.
The same is doubly true for the state. Look at its actions as a whole. Its set of motivations. How it prospers and what it fears. Governments are sociopaths -- entities free of inhibition or conscience -- that want to preserve their monopolies, and they don't care who they have to kill to do it. Bitcoin threatens many of those monopolies. Expect violent resistance.

Because I think without that power, government spending will be limited to a degree much lower than what we put up with today. Growing government would mean more direct taxation, and that's a much harder sell than "raising the debt ceiling".

Very high quality video.
It would be good to mention during the description of "mining" that mining itself is what keeps the bitcoin economy moving. Without mining, transactions are not processed. The system is designed to reward people for keeping it fast and secure.

Free trade does not worsen the gap between rich and poor. Criminal exploitation of the poor does. Things like forcing the poor to use a currency that gradually erodes in order to enrich a banking cartel.
If Bitcoin became the currency of the common man, you'd see the return of a strong middle class in no time flat.

I'm not saying it's more convenient than PayPal for everyone everywhere right now. I'm saying that it is for *some* people, and it costs you very little to accommodate them. A BitPay account is cheaper for you than PayPal and the bitcoin-spending customer doesn't have to do anything extra. Personally, I'd rather use bitcoin than PayPal or credit cards for my online transactions. As someone who already has some bitcoin and the apps to use it, paying with bitcoin is much, much more convenient for me than PayPal. It's also safer for my personally-identifiable information.
Bitcoin escrow services exist already, and are used in cases where the customer wants it. In my opinion PayPal's approach to dispute resolution can be very unfair to sellers.

So what? They'll have lots of bitcoins. They can either buy things with them or trade them back into the marketplace. They're not supervillain wizards. Market manipulation is a process of deliberately taking losses in order to make the market *appear* different for a finite period of time.

The truly remarkable thing is that nobody has stepped forward to take credit. There has to be a reason for this. Is it because it adds mystique to the software? Did "Satoshi" fear persecution from the elites? It's impossible to say, but if it were me it would be the latter.
Without exaggeration, the success of bitcoin represents a mortal threat to the nation-state. State power comes from the ability to stand between the agents of a financial transaction and demand a tribute. Bitcoin circumvents this with stunning thoroughness. We are lucky they have not really noticed yet. If Kim Dotcom or Julian Assange are any indication, constructing a subversive platform gets you in huge trouble with governments all over the world. And there is nothing more subversive than this.

A tip I've learned from life and the economists I admire: You can discover the likelihood of a crash by thinking from the point of view of someone who is buying the asset without the intention to just resell it for cash at a higher price later.
Over the past week, I'd been seeing more and more press about Bitcoin, but when I actually looked around to try and spend it, I only had a few options, and most of them were drying up fast.
The technology promises to be absolutely revolutionary so I wanted to believe it would just keep going, but honestly nothing new has been built with it (except that black market for stocks) since the price started climbing two months ago. The bitcoin network is chugging along just as it always has, but the institutions people have built to facilitate it are amateurish and prone to compromise.
The price will climb again whenever bitcoin's contract enforcement features are implemented in a way average people can use them.

I agree it will be difficult to get people to spend their BTC if it keeps appreciating 10% per day. Nevertheless, I still spent some at $60 because I saw something I really wanted (a rare coin).
I'm not an economist but I think a currency appreciation rate around 2-8 percent per year would be ideal.
We are entering an age in which currencies will be the creations not of central planners but of inventors, who will compete with each other to come up with the most preferable monetary system.

Thing is, Taco Bell will still be there tomorrow. My faith doesn't change reality. Same goes for bitcoins. The network will most likely be around long after I'm dead. Gold? Even better. The laws of physics say that those gold atoms in my coins will be there for the next quadrillion years or whatever.
The US Dollar? The government might transform it into SchruteBucks next year for all I know. Maybe confiscate all of them overnight and pay us all back with half-priced Euros. The like has happened before and it will happen again.

Of course. Bitcoin right now is practically nothing. If PayPal starts taking it, in the vast majority of cases people aren't going to care if bitcoin features in their transactions or not.
The biggest benefit I see from PayPal getting on board would be that two people could conduct business "in bitcoin" even if only one of them has ever heard of it. The other party wouldn't have to know anything about it or change their routine in any way.
My original point is this: Even in the rose-colored future where bitcoin is on the mind of every online shopper, bitcoin isn't the sort of system any private firm like PayPal could monopolize. Remember this is a decentralized, peer-to-peer system. There is literally no such thing as an institutional threat.
edit: I realize now that what I see as a cool new feature that opens up new markets is to you horrible news, because it doesn't compel customers to enter the bitcoin milieu. We'll just have to agree to disagree.

If you "owe" them for your prosperity then it should be a measurable debt, not just the guesses of a Congressional committee that thought 23% sounded like a nice round number. In other words, if taxes are a legitimate debt, then why don't you get an itemized bill for the services you received? Every other service provider and creditor I pay can demonstrate exactly what I owe and why. Not so with the IRS. Just a blanket demand every year that *I* figure it out. Does that seem right to you?

Look at how history has unfolded in the past. Name one case where an empire was in the midst of a totalitarian shift, and the tide was turned by vociferous defenders of sanity speaking up and changing the public's minds. It just doesn't happen.
What does happen? **Brain drains.** When a government is leading its people to ruin, it begins preying more and more ravenously on society's most productive people. These citizens, the country's best and brightest, flee to another country before the implosion.
In all likelihood the transformation of the US into a second-rate dictatorship is inevitable.

The vast majority of people will *never* actually understand how Bitcoin works, but it doesn't matter. If it's a superior technology and money system to the status quo (I'm sure it is) then the features will win out and people will use it not knowing what all happens under the hood.

PayPal can't monopolize Bitcoin. If they start taking Bitcoin they will ramp up adoption in a big way.

It is a hobby of conspiracy theorists to imagine ways that every single ray of hope is actually a plot by the bad guys to come get you. The redditor quoted in the article keeps saying "OPENLY" which makes me think he heard this from Alex Jones. Jones is fond of guilt by association and reciting the word "OPENLY" in order to suggest that the subject at hand reprehensible and these bad guys aren't ashamed of it. I guarantee that if the IMF wants a global digital currency, they were imagining one they controlled, not a distributed network built on bottom-up consensus.
For people like this, the only way to be happy and free is to live in the woods on a pile of freeze-dried food, ammo and gold. They can't be just a little bit happy that a monetary system is on the rise that places control of the production of money into the hands of people who are neither the state nor central bankers. They can't have even a little bit of optimism that the features offered by bitcoin might be good for the world, whether it's surveilled or not.
The surveillance capabilities of bitcoin run both ways anyway. If bitcoin becomes the "global currency" we'll be paying our taxes with it, which means we can follow the money trail of taxation as far as it goes. If government spends its money somewhere, and people leak the addresses they paid taxes to, the recipient of the funds could analyze just whose tax money they are getting.
The inability to conjure new monetary units out of thin air places a strict limit on the ways the state can extract wealth from people. The modern warfare state cannot exist without currency debasement.

There is no such thing as "intrinsic value," there is only exchange value. There might not be a whole lot that's special about a bitcoin in itself, but the bitcoin network provides a unique service. If you believe that service still has a future, bitcoin still has a future.
Bitcoin currently has some surmountable technical barriers keeping it from having an even better value proposition, but those will be solved over time by programmers. More serious problems are those of infrastructure. In the US it can be quite difficult to find a place that will sell you BTC. I've basically given up on the thought of ever converting back into Dollars.
As a product, bitcoin has demonstrated that it can do the same thing credit cards do for online purchases, but more easily and without steep card fees, or risks of fraud or identity theft. It's a superior product. Now customers need to be convinced of that fact.
Even if bitcoin ends up only as a pass-through currency for e-commerce (ala BitPay) we're looking at an ultimate price that's multiples of what we see today.
Interference from government will only temporarily get in the way.
