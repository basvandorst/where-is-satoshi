You don't have to be an expert to see that bitcoin has become such a scamshow with all the forks and miner drama plus it really can't deal with the tasks bitcoin was meant for...

Idk about as much as a rock which is basically more useful than Bitcoin.

Its time for BTC to die and let alot more advanced (and actually useful) projects get their fair share of the crypto marketcap. Only thing going for BTC is it's long history and name. How can you defend the fact it takes like 5$ to send 1$ worth of bitcoin plus the whole transaction takes like a day to complete.

These posts are so stupid, btc would be dead for long if it weren't first. It is literally a dinosaur technology compared to other cryptos.

It can't and it never will, bitcoin is just for buying and forgetting it to somewhere for years

Yes, ofcourse people are going to pay transfer fees larger than the item itself and also wait atleast an hour... Bitcoin may be good investment profit wise but it will never go wide adoption because there are so much better alternatives.
