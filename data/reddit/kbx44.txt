You are right! That was a major mistake on my side, ouch :/
I don't really know how many bits in the blockchain there are so I can't count it now but what you came up with is the right way I guess.

I'll be using metric, mostly. 
1 ounce = 28.3495 grams according to google.
According to wikipedia 1 mole of gold (Au) weighs 196.966569 grams.
Therefore 1 ounce of Au is 0.1439305165 mole.
Number of atoms per mole is 6.022140857x10^23 (Avogadro constant).
Now, by multiplying the Avogadro constant by the amount of moles in 1 ounce of Au we get 8.66769844x10^22 atoms per 1 ounce of Au.
One Au atom comprises 79 electrons, so it's 6.847481768x10^24 electrons per 1 ounce of Au.
1 Ounce of Au is worth $1,239.20 at the time of writing this. Therefore 1 Au electron is worth $1.809716392x10^-22.
~~Now on to BTC.
One electron weighs 9.10938356x10^-28 grams.
We know that 1 ounce = 28.3495 grams, so it gives us 3.112120575x10^28 electrons per 1 ounce of, well, electrons.
At the time of writing this, 1 BTC is worth $1275.12. Therefore 1 BTC electron is worth $4.097270556x10^-26.~~
~~$1.809716392x10^-22 &gt; $4.097270556x10^-26
Therefore the electrons in Au are worth more than the electrons in BTC.~~
I might've very well messed something up but it looks like everything's all right, correct me if I'm wrong.
Thanks u/pdubl for pointing out the error. What I got is basically the price of an electron if an ounce of electrons was worth the same money as one BTC. The actual price of an electron in a Bitcoin is much higher than what I got.
