There are several burn addresses from the old days. There are coins involved in illegal activity or hacks that are being monitored (I would think). 
Theres some docunented cases of wallets lost forever. 
But the honest answer is about as hard as keeping track of all gold in the world. We will never know how many people lost their private keys. 
I am sure that many people who own bitcoin have died or lost their keys. But tracking that is beyond difficult.

@_date: 2018-01-08 05:57:00
They split off (hard forked) from the original Bitcoin to try to increase transaction speed by increasing the blockchain size.
It works in the short term. Admittedly Btrash is faster and cheaper than BTC at this moment (I actually did a test transaction yesterday). But they also have a fraction of the userbase. 
If they had as many users as BTC does it wouldn't work for long. They'd need to keep adding larger blocks. 
The Core developers for Bitcoin saw a different way forward and the big blockers couldn't get over the idea that Satoshi's word wasn't being followed to the letter. 
Segwit + LN + Schnorr + MAST combined are going to have a massive affect on how we transact with BTC. 
A blocksize increase may happen someday. But not before all other options to maximize transaction capacity are exhausted. 
There are also certain advantages for the miners to having big blocks and no Segwit and they decided they wanted to keep those advantages.
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:53:11
Did you really have $188k in Bitcoin and you didn't secure it right?
Edit and $130k in litecoin..

My only complaint about purse is the difficulty of returns or problems with an order. I bought some headphones that failed within a month of use. I spent $150 or so on them.

[Confidential transactions are in the pipeline.]( 
There are also certain altcoins that are building themselves around privacy (monero, Zcash). 
Privacy is nice and very necessary, but if you ever want to buy a lambo or a house you're going to need to demonstrate a paper trail and the IRS takes notice if you have a lambo but an on paper record of making 40k a year. 


They might be able to identify certain points along a transaction chain that occurs but if authorities don't know who a wallet belongs to it's fairly difficult to pin down. That's part of why more end users of dark net markets haven't been arrested. You have to be using pretty lax security to get pinched.
If the DEA could identify every bitcoin transaction from 2010 until now and what it was for a lot more people would have been charged.

[More than likely he had seen what the US government had done to people who had tried to create alternative currencies.]( 
If my BTC history is correct (someone correct me if I'm wrong) Satoshi disappeared after [Gavin went to brief the CIA on Bitcoin.]( 
Pandora's box was opened and Satoshi was no longer needed to let Bitcoin continue doing what it does today. 
I hope he/she/they are living well somewhere or died peacefully (Hal Finney theory). 
Good ideas outlast their creators and Satoshi in the span of a very short period of time created the financial revolution that spawned this sub and the economy surrounding crypto at large. 
Was he in danger? Probably not physical harm at the time, but if the governments of the world found out who he was they probably would have locked him up. 
If he resurfaced again today there would be a bounty on him in the sum total of the original genesis blocks and their value today along with all of their other known wallets which are quite valuable today. 
Satoshi likely took great care with his internet access and was, "behind 10 proxies" to use an old stereotype and probably knew how to stay as anonymous as possible for the period he was involved. The longer he stayed involved the more opportunities TPTB and other online communities would have to dox him.
I'm glad he's gone. He earned his place in history and gave the human race a wonderful gift. 
Code speaks louder than individuals and the community will continue to build on his creation.

They are privacy zealots. Their team has impressed me time and time again with their over the top dedication to privacy and long term vision with Bitcoin. 
I still use Mycellium as a spending wallet but my relationship with them will come to an end once Sam. gets a little better. They only have 2 devs working iirc so changes are slow but steady. 
Their wallet is still technically in development/beta last I checked, but they are making strong headway every month. They are one of the only mobile wallets that supports segwit. 
I wouldn't use them to store anything more than a portion of a coin for now. 
Mycellium used to be king of mobile wallets, but they've completely dropped off the face of customer engagement and keep adding ads or weird alt coin pre-sales to their app after taking customer token sales which should have funded them for some time.

LN channels can only support a portion of a Bitcoin. 
Big purchases will still be done on chain, but with most "coffee" purchases occurring on LN combined with other scaling improvements (MAST,Schnorr etc) fees and confirmation time issues should be mitigated for on chain transactions.
LN isn't an altcoin it's simply a second layer of settlement that works faster than on chain transactions.

Hey I know it's easy to blame Bitcoin as we are the biggest Crypto. 
No one is mining Bitcoin with GPU's. 
Altcoins are being mined using GPUs. 
Zcash, Ethereum, etc. 
As a gamer, and a GPU miner myself I sympathize. I love playing games too and if I was in the market to build a brand new PC I'd be heated too. 
You should really be directing your outrage towards the companies that make these cards. They've had the data that the GPU market was heating up for months now and they need to scale their production up. 
Nvidia and AMD can mitigate this problem. 
1. Scale up production. Obviously needs to happen. 
2.  They need to make GPU units specifically geared for miners. No video out. 
3.  Tell Newegg, Amazon, and other retailers to limit sales of normal graphics cards to a certain limit per account every few months. Or offer steep discounts when purchasing bundle deals that are obviously intended for a PC gaming setup and not mining. 
But let the mining cards have a free for all. Bulk orders, whatever. 
Crypto isn't going anywhere any time soon and this community is growing every day. 
I know it's frustrating for you in the short term, but there's an entire community of people mining crypto and securing their financial futures. As a gamer, securing financial security takes a front seat to playing PUBG. 
The GPU miners would really rather have cheaper cards again. So they're not happy with the price situation either. 
I hope this makes sense.

You will need to send it to a legacy wallet first of some form first since Coinbase doesn't seem to recognize Segwit wallets.
I suggest withdrawing via gdax (no fees) to a wallet that does support Segwit (Samourai, Trezor) and you can then send it to your main segwit wallet from there. 
Fees are dirt cheap at the moment so you can use 5-10 sat/b and get it pretty quickly.

Problem is if there's a $600 threshold for no taxes, people might just buy $599.99 worth of gold repeatedly to get around the law.

1. It isn't true. It may solve them in the short term, but even if Bcash had the transaction volume and attacks Bitcoin has those 8 MB blocks probably wouldn't be enough. They would have to increase the blocksize again, and again, and again.

This is other people's money and if your exchange messes up it can cost a lot of money with a bug/glitch. We've been making noise on here and Social Media. Companies are slowly hopping on board.

Don't fall for this nonsense. Mixing is no longer an effective way of hiding your coin activity and it's very expensive to do so. It also paints a huge target on your back from a legal perspective if you're an operator.

These days you gotta check on how backed up the mempool is. 
If it's over 70,000 and you need that money fast, I suggest using a slightly higher fee.

I'm really not sure. I probably should have qualified it with for now. 
I'm trusting core to do this right. 
I've seen more shenanigans from the other camp than I have from Core. 
If you're a SE you can run circles on me from a technical standpoint. So I'm not going to try. 


My understanding is that users own their payments channels and can close their channels. LN would be used for small payments (coffee!). While the main chain would still be used for settling big purchases. 
I can also see a future where Litecoin works in synchronicity with Bitcoin. 
In terms of Bcash vs. SW + LN I'm far more convinced on the latter.

Bitcoin is shrugging off all of the attacks on it. The shitty forks are dying.

Coinbase started as an access portal with fees and just made the process of making bitcoin stupid easy. 
As time went on they introduced a full/real exchange. Improving liquidity on the exchange likely is influenced by fees, and if they wanted a thriving exchange they needed their fees to be competitive. 
The only real difference is UX and fees.

We actually have a flair (removal tag) for "financial advice" that we use from time to time. We use this particularly if someone is advising high risk options.
"Go 100x on Bitmex."
"Sell all your stocks for Bitcoin."
etc etc. 
If we weren't removing crappy ICO posts and random altcoin pumps a lot of our newer less seasoned users would have explored investing in less stable/scammy cryptocurrencies with 90% or more in losses.
Regardless with any asset Bitcoin, Gold, or Amazon stock, it's not wise to buy near the top of an irrational bull market. If you hypothetically failed to do your own research then that is ultimately on you. 
Trust me when I say that if we weren't actively removing scam/spam posts this sub would be littered with ICO scams, youtube trader crystal ball videos, and other altcoins.
Can you point me to where disinformation has caught your attention? If something is clearly disinformation/fud it will often be removed. But if you mean news events around an ETF or the such, then every social media platform is going to be discussing that. If we remove active and current news then people get mad. 
So if we tighten down on what makes it to the front page, then people complain about censorship! 
If we loosen up then the quality of the front page goes downhill fast and we get mod mail messages asking why a certain post is on the front page.
It's a delicate balance and we're human just like you.

Courtesy of whom has a better technical understanding of this than I. 
With 51% the miners can essentially censor or block transactions and successfully doublespend their transactions going back a certain number of blocks.
They cannot steal coins.
But the cost is immense
If they do attack, they will be destroying the value of bitcoin while still incurring the expense of mining it.
And censoring an individual’s transaction(s) may be too expensive to keep up because they risk damaging their reward terribly
I’ve glanced at that article and it’s just plain nonsense really. He’s what I would call an idealist, rationalist.  For him, unless everyone has egalitarian or equal power then you can’t call a system decentralized.
But we saw this year that nobody has total power over bitcoin, as the miners and even the miners plus the most powerful corporations tried to hard fork it and had to surrender at the 11th hour.
A lot of people are butthurt about not getting into bitcoin earlier and now they are writing bs like this or talking about tulips or whatever.
TLDR: We've seen worse than a 51% attack and we are still here.

Coinbase is the consumer site for people who don't want to mess with more advanced trading platforms.

What the...uh...normies don't understand is that banking isn't something you should be able to turn off. Even for the worst people in society. Everyone needs to transact. Everyone needs to buy food, homes, power, etc. 
My personal philosophy is that if you can't force people out of the ~~banking~~ monetary transactional system you will have to actually....
***confront the root causes of the groups like the alt-right, drug dealers, terrorists, etc from a socio-pollitical angle.*** 
Maybe if these blue collar folks weren't losing their jobs to China the alt-right wouldn't be forming to blame immigrants for their jobs losses.
Maybe if the US hadn't bombed the middle east for 60 years and backed coups ISIS and other militant groups wouldn't exist. 
Fun fact: The US government armed and trained Al Qaeda in the 80's, including Osama
These groups don't just wake up and decide "hey let's cleanse the country of people that are different than us" a series of economic and social events took place that led them to develop as they are now. Often funded and guided by a monolithic government. 
Bitcoin and crypto don't require permission to use. We will have to find other ways to stop the madness of our world besides authoritarian banking policies.

The pound? Not particularly. 
Inflation on big fiat currencies is slow and insidious creeping over generations. 
But go talk to some of the South American countries and see how they feel about inflation. 
Bitcoin on the other hand is the most stable payment system/currency on the face of the planet. 
Supply is capped and issuance is predictable. 
Can't be controlled by any single party. 
No third parties can stop it from moving.
The price is just something humans make up, but the functionality of Bitcoin is stable.
Just because the price goes down doesn't mean Bitcoin is less stable.

I have my critiques of Coinbase.
Security isn't one of them. 
I am quite sure they are aware of the weight of their brand in the space and have gone above and beyond the norms of security for their cold storage wallets. I see a large hack being very unlikely for them.
What I could see is their hotwallet getting compromised at some point but they keep such a small percentage of their funds in there that it would be a minor inconvenience from a business perspective. 
Their insurance company I'm sure is also forcing them to take some pretty lengthy security measures to satisfy their policy.
But at the end of the day, don't keep your Bitcoin on Coinbase and this will never be an issue for you.
Edit: it's also a likely assumption that all of the large companies involved with big hacks (bitfinex, etc) have had closed door discussions on how to improve exchange security for the greater good of the eco system.

I'm a mod here and obviously very bullish on Bitcoin, but even I haven't cashed out my 401k and ROTH IRA. I still contribute to both. Even thought I would have made far more this year if I hadn't.

Libertarians aren't about no regulation, they're about as little regulation as possible. That's why they aren't anarchists. 


Sure, but how did your fraud problem even start? Credit cards are incredibly insecure and easy to steal/use. There are entire darknet markets dedicated to stolen card numbers. 
"It's taken care of" by the ridiculous interest rates they charge on people. A privatized form of socialism. 
Bitcoin is pretty easy to secure with some basic steps, so having your Bitcoin stolen has become less common as knowledge on security has spread. It will only get better.
With credit cards scammers just need to know a few things about you and they can spend your money. 
With Bitcoin you have a closely guarded seed which is vastly superior IMO than trusting companies to not leak your private info.

There are a few minor underlying tech issues, specifically the "block size" debate that limits it to 7 transactions per second. Visa can process thousands per second. An improvement is in the works and some proposals are being hashed out and hopefully deployed soon.
The next piece of the puzzle is usability. It's still takes days or weeks to explain how bitcoin works and how to do stuff with it, especially to non tech savvy people. 
The biggest piece of the puzzle is being able to use it on food, gas, and rent. I'm the biggest Bitcoin zealot out there, but I can't go 100% bitcoin when I still have to pay my day-to-day expenses in fiat. 
The day I can scan a QR code at Costco and pay for my goods is the day Bitcoin has won. 
Speaking from my professional life, I know the thing holding it back is that institutions like GAAP are not Bitcoin friendly yet. Most people in the legacy financial world are still skeptical (who can blame them, most people are skeptical of all new things). 
The most important Bitcoin needs at this point is time to mature and spread. People are less trusting of a 7 year old currency than other methods and more coins need to be distributed. 
I'm not sure if you're aware, but the issuance rate is about to be cut in half next July (or so) and the last time this happened the value of coins went up shortly after. 
People like Bitcoin because from now until the end of time, we know how many coins will exist at any given time and no one can print more. There's no quantitative easing for Bitcoin. No bail outs. Most importantly the feds can't steal your coins against your will if you take proper precautions (like stealing pensions to pay government debts).
I could go on but this is the world the internet has created for Bitcoin and this community disagrees on a lot of things, but there's one thing we like that most other humans like.
 Financial sovereignty.

We were taken off guard by the bull run it happened really fast. A lot of people were in the Bitcoin space. I think I can speak for all of other the moderators on that point but they are welcome to chime in otherwise. 
[even stickied this post 9 months ago.]( 
We didn't have time to think about where we would be today. We were having multiple posts per minute and subsequent spam/scams popping up that needed moderating. Our focus was on trying to maintain some type of quality to the front page and purge scams. 
People all over this sub shared the advice of "[Don't invest more than you can afford to lose]( was shared over the last year that many should have taken to heart. 
Unfortunately newer users only focused on the lambos and euphoria. 
So while we can post helpful things like theymos did, Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. No hardcore Bitcoiner thinks it is. 
Bitcoin is radical self reliance for finance and people took a risk buying. As they do with any stock or asset. 
You could buy a house today and we have another financial recession the next day. 
I bought some Bitcoin at the pump to $1000 in 2013 and subsequently ran through the multi year bear market, I wasn't a moderator back then but I didn't blame the mods of this sub for my own mistake even though "To the moon!!!!" was the catch phrase of the time.

"The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."

My dad is also 65 and he now owns a few bitcoin. He understands it has value, but still doesn't see some of the larger blocktech implications. 
He reads most of what I send him and he is starting to understand the collectible nature and the rarity. 
He's a heady skeptic being a business masters. But he's seeing the changes and the need for it.
Not all people 65+ get it or are too old to care about changing the world since they haven't got much time left. It's hard to convince them into something that they won't be around to see blossom.

Don't take a loan out for anything Bitcoin related. Reality is that it could go to 0 tomorrow, or next week, or next year.
If you were even going to take a loan, it would be better to just buy the coins. 
Mining profitably requires a lot of tech, experience with networking, and most importantly electricity. Cooling your space will get expensive fast and if there's any delay whatsoever in getting your equipment you could lose a lot of money. 
Just use your savings on some Bitcoin and don't invest more than you could afford to lose.
If your mining company went belly up and you had 200k in debt you'd be a sad panda.

Okay so let's remove it from this specific example and get hypothetical. 
I buy something legal from someone via CL or another medium.
 The person I'm buying from is a high level vendor that is selling something illegal.
I have no knowledge of their private activities, I just want my legal goods I bought.
They give me their payment address that's "flagged" by coinbase and I send them money.
Even though I didn't buy anything illegal and it's not my fault if I send bitcoin to the provided address, my account gets shut down. 
I know there are KYC laws and everything that Coinbase *has* to follow. I'm not knocking that. But can you see how this might affect consumers who simply engage in a normal and legal transaction with someone with a flagged wallet? 
My point is there needs to be an inquiry and an appeal process for things like this and a higher standard of proof. 
I've been a long time Coinbase customer, I'm not buying large quantities of Meth from the Darknets or anything, but if I haphazardly make one transaction to a wallet that's flagged....my long time coinbase relationship ends due to this approach and policy....
Is there a way Coinbase can add a notification of some sort, "Warning: You are about to send funds to an address that is flagged in our system. Do you still want to send it?"
From that point you can provide a chance to provide supplementary data (CL emails, pictures of the goods purchased, etc) to show you're not making an illegal transaction?
Might be more work, but your customers deserve the benefit of the doubt if they can prove they aren't being shady.......?

Because the very thing that fuels Bitcoin interest is distrust of the banks. (and the financial system at large)
I doubt the banks are going to release competitive crypto currencies called BankCoin, but the same way they trust gold over a check...bitcoin is impartial, easy to verify.
Right now the tools are a little harder to use for the end user and scary for some. But they will improve, coin security will improve, and more vendors will accept it. 
Let's face it people don't trust the banks. Especially after the last recession. Millennials especially. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:45:13
If you have 10k in cash saved (or anything that's not used for day to day survival) you can convert it to BTC. At this point it seems plausible that Greece is in for a major crash in their markets and currency. 
Keep your greek money for essential expenses like food. But your nest egg could lose a large portion if the value of the currency it's stored in lost value.
If they chose to use gold over Bitcoin that would be a great option too.
It doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin, gold, or something else. But having a store of value that is not going to fail seems pretty important.

Because it may very well have been Variety Jones that ordered the hits if they were real. Further, two corrupt DEA agents were involved in the whole situation which is a massive conflict of interest. 
Ross was never charged with the murders. They have yet to announce a trial date for them and as far as I know they were dropped. Suppressed data that have still not been disclosed to the public. 
Shithead or not, he still put Bitcoin on the map years before it would have been normally by creating the first bitcoin accepting open free market.

They're designed that way. Separation of private keys from anything with an internet connection.
You can create cold wallets on your own with multiple applications such as Samourai or Electrum. 
If you're going to go the electrum route I suggest using a computer with a fresh OS install to ensure that no keyloggers are on it. 
You don't need to keep your wallet on the tablet, just store your 12 word seed somewhere safe and non-digital. 
The general preference is not to keep your main stash on a device with an active internet connection.
People also generate word seeds and store them on phyiscal implements like this: 
You could generate as many seeds as you want and have multiple hard copies of your wallet that never need to touch a internet connected device until you are ready.
Tablets can be broken into, or physically broken without a backup your coins are lost forever. Many Bitcoiners keep multiple copies of their seeds in secure locations. 
Hardware wallets seem very expensive until your private keys get intercepted and your coins stolen. 
Look at it this way, you can buy a Trezor, create multiple wallets with unique seeds on it, and store your 12 word seeds on multiple platforms (paper, steel, whatever). 
Then put your Trezor away somewhere safe and only break it out when you want to spend your coin.
I remember struggling with the thought of buying a hardware wallet years ago, but it simplifies a lot of the harder security in Bitcoin. It seemed like too much money to spend. 
But financial peace of mind is worth it.

From the paragraph before:
"If all Bitcoin transactions were on the blockchain, to enable 7 billion people to make two
transactions per day, it would require 24GB blocks every ten minutes at best (presuming 250
bytes per transaction and 144 blocks per day). Conducting all global payment transactions on
the blockchain today implies miners will need to do an incredible amount of computation,
severely limiting bitcoin scalability and full nodes to a few centralized processors."
I'm not a dev/engineer. So whatever my opinion is isn't particularly important in the grand scheme. 
I don't buy the "LN is here to centralize and make it into Visa" argument that I've heard parroted in the other sub.
I trust core/LN to do this right. They have a lot riding on it being done right. They want Bitcoin to succeed. They know there's an angry horde out there if they do something truly malicious. 
My understanding is that blocks can be bigger on a second layer where the transaction parameters/restrictions are different and can flow faster. 
I don't like the idea of mining becoming more centralized than it already is into data centers where massive industrial hard drives are the only option. Decentralization is key.
Right now the entire blockchain fits on a thumbdrive. 
Larger blocks on a secondary layer that operates trustlessly seems like a good idea to me. 
Bigger blocks seem like the crypto-caveman equivalent of hitting it with a club until it works. 
When I said beating a dead horse, I meant that the core development team has collectively decided bigger blocks were not the answer. 
BCH is free to do their own thing now. 
Notice how I haven't removed your comments or banned you. There is a succinct difference between discussion and coming in with the overt assumption that the other option is better. Not to mention outright trolling and yelling about Satoshi's vision. 
Satoshi isn't a god. He's not some force immune from being wrong. He/she/they are human like all of us. 
After 4 years of watching Bitcoin, bigger blocks at this time doesn't seem like the answer.
I think it's a possibility we'll see a small increase in block size in the coming years after Segwit and LN are fully deployed. But we will have to wait and see.

Coinbase has a lot of haters, but for newbies getting onboarded they have proven to mostly be a safe bet. 
Coinbase is not going to hack your bank account. 
They have a reputation to maintain and compromising your bank details would hurt that reputation, especially if they did it en masse. 
Samourai and Mycellium will give you a 12 word seed. As long as no one finds your 12 word seed there's more chance of the sun exploding tomorrow than someone guessing your 12 word seed. So write it down and put it somewhere safe, make duplicates in case of a disaster.
If you're truly worried about security then grab yourself a Trezor. 
I suggest starting with Samourai if you're on Android.

I was a big blocker too.
Not because I had thought it through, but simply because Satoshi said we'd need to increase the blocksize eventually.
But I knew enough that I didn't have the technical knowledge to comprehend the challenges and goals core was aiming for.
Even when Bcash was surging less than a year ago. I was having some doubts. LN hadn't been proven to work yet, and I was genuinely concerned if I had "picked the wrong side".
I did more research and was patient.

Your post makes several assumptions
- Block size will remain at 1 MB forever (we already have bigger than 1 MB blocks being mined) and someday Core may deem it time to raise the block size after other scaling methods are fully utilized. A block of 100% segwit transactions can fit ~4 MB of data in it iirc. 
- 7 billion people will need a payment channel open
- No other scaling changes are made to the base Bitcoin protocol to allow for faster channel opens. 
So even *if* your math is 100% spot on and correct here it ignores so much other context that is subject to change over the coming decades.
You're essentially saying that we will need 10,000,000,000 litres of rocket fuel to escape the milky way galaxy but someone invents warp drive anyway.

I have some questions as a former Mycelium user. I now use Samourai because they offer Segwit and good privacy/security options. They're not directed at you, but as Mycelium as a organization. 
* Why has Mycelium been so out of contact with the community compared to other wallet developers? The last tweet on the Mycellium twitter handle is January 22nd. 
* What happened to the Mycelium ICO? Mycelium raised a lot of capital and gave nothing to those token holders afaik. Or even provided some kind of update. 
* Why is Segwit such a low priority for Mycellium but sketchy altcoin buy options are perpetually added to the wallet? I think there's been 4-5 added in the last year. 
I *really* loved Mycellium and used it for years. Then it suddenly went downhill. Your developer page on Google Play has an email that only bounces back the few times I've messaged in. 
Mycelium has been pretty much absent from the scene for the last year and pushing out small updates and little communication on what's going on internally at Mycellium after taking a large amount of community money.
Now you're asking for Beta Testers after seemingly ignoring us, delaying segwit, and working on other projects. 
I'm not trying to be hostile here, but my personal patience for Mycelium ran out and I migrated to another wallet.

1. The FOMC first approves the purchase of US government bonds on the 'open market'. [When the government is short of funds, the Treasury issues bonds and delivers them to independent bond dealers, which auction them off.}
2. When the FED wants to "expand the money supply'"i.e. create money the New York Fed bank buys these government bonds from the independent securities dealers (financial markets always have an equal number of buyers and sellers).
    
3. The Fed pays for its purchases with electronic credits to the sellers' banks, which, in turn, credit the sellers' bank accounts. These credits are literally created out of nothing.
    
4. The banks receiving the credits use them as reserves and loan out several times the amount of the money held in reserve due to the magic of fractional reserve banking. If their reserve requirement is 10% then 10 times the money put into reserve can be loaned out. The banks can create new loans because of these increased reserves. As the money is loaned the money supply in the U.S. increases.

Fungibility is undoubtedly a big issue. 
IMO scaling needs to be handled first.
When we start dealing with fungibility governments and other bank-friendly state associated actors are going to come out of the woodworks against anonymous digital cash. 
The Bitcoin virus needs more time to spread before it can become anonymous. That's just my opinion. But the sooner it's anonymous is the sooner that exchanges and businesses will have more trouble accepting it as currency. 
I'm of the belief the feds don't want us to have such a currency and the moment Bitcoin starts flirting with serious anonymity the feds are going to start trying to apply leverage. 
Right now they love Bitcoin because from a financial analysis perspective it's pretty easy to trace Bitcoin.

The problem is not Coinbase. The problem is the people who are watching Coinbase. 
Either don't use coinbase as your normal wallet, or lobby the politicans involved with the rules for them. 
The other option is to use a tumbler like Helix and move all your coins to a fresh anonymous wallet that you haven't connected to your identity. 
  
Your money's anonymity is your freedom. Regardless if you're buying drugs, paying off a credit card bill, or something else. We as humans deserve privacy when we want it.

Inflation is something of an invisible tax. The purchasing power of a dollar has been steadily decreasing over the last 100 years. Average wages have not risen to meet that inflation. Companies don't want to pay more. The problem isn't the companies so much. It's the medium with which they have to pay employees. 
The money is fundamentally broken.
Leaving 100k in a checking account or hidden away over the last 100 years would have left you comparatively broke.
By default you're forced to trust third parties to invest your money or pick stocks. At any time the stock market can crash again as it has done many times before. 
Bitcoin you only have to trust yourself and know that over time these digitally scarce tokens get harder and harder to come by.
If your money over time loses a large chunk of it's value every generation then it's not sound money.

Necessity is the mother of all innovation. If consumers aren't easily spending then companies will adapt or die. Free market. 


Products that aren't designed to break in two years. Products and services that actually solve problems. Products and services that provide real quantifiable value or perceived value to consumers.

Bitcoin is an experiment. Most of our community is aware that Bitcoin may be the precursor to the future currency. 
The car is a protocol. The car is always a car. 4 wheels self steered. As a concept it completely changed the game.
A car manufacturer would be like looking at Dodge vs Ford. 
It's like comparing google to webcrawler.
Bitcoin is like search engines as a whole to the individual companies (google/webcrawler/askjeeves)
The core idea still remains. But a corporation facilitating it came out on top (google).

There is a limited supply of Bitcoins. Currently there are only about 12.5 million last I checked. The limit of 21 million will be hit in 2140 ish.
The value is based on the prices that others are buying and selling theirs for. You are welcome to buy a bitcoin for 1400 when the market says 600. But why would anyone do that? Someone did sell 3000 for 100 a piece the other day on Bitstamp. They took quite a hit...

As more money enters the money supply for Bitcoin, the value will increase and the usefulness and likeliness of hoarding for each coin will increase. 
Bitcoin is deflationary since by the time we get to the next halving, things will be very different, when the supply of coins is restricted, price rises.

unregulated doesn't necessarily mean unsafe. If there's 10 reviews saying driver xyz is a scammer, creeper, or otherwise unsavory person that's huge.
If another drive has 1000 rides completed with an average of 4.89/5 stars that says a lot. 
Also, someone will eventually provide the *SERVICE* of verifying paperwork/insurance/etc of the driver in question. Some drivers might even spring for nicer insurance that covers all occupants.

Nothing concrete. I'm just saying that during the real gold rush, there were probably a few pick axes hastily made. If you understand the analogy. 
Worst case scenario is some identities get stolen.

Case: Put up an ATM that's actually an identity harvesting machine. Leave no traces. Send to local laptop stashed near the ATM. Pick it up later. Steal identites,btc using the information you've gathered.

I'm sorry that's not true. A large portion of Bitstamp's merchants hold their coins. I'm sure there's a large portion with coinbase and other providers as well. There's plenty of money/value in the system and the overall value of the bitcoin network is invaluable. 
Eventually coins will become very expensive to generate and their issuance rate will slow down. 
The reality is Bitcoin wasn't supposed to be worth 1200 in 2013. It really wasn't ready and no one understood it. Mt.Gox did that to the market and now the market has been slowly correcting for the last few months.

If time isn't an issue Just take a cold storage wallet with you (maybe only take the passkey with you) and send the wallet via encryped email.
Once there you can start piecing it out slowly in person to person transactions.
You can also buy high value goods and resell them slowly on ebay or the European equivalent.
This would be much slower but you would potentially make money and reduce the number of fees.

As long as Canucks have the right to semi-private mail and PGP, there's not much they can do until the bitcoin are converted to fiat. 
Also, a burner phone with mycellium makes it even simpler to cash out.

Each note that is printed is a theft from future generations as our debt balloons.
With bitcoin, counterfeiting and money printing is eliminated until someone cracks SHA and then we can upgrade to a better encryption set.

If we only have 10% of the USD transactions and we are at the year 2140 then I would consider Bitcoin a failed experiment at that point. 
The transaction fee will remain small but it's still optional if you're using an actual client...you can set a fee of zero, but it might take a while for the network to confirm.

One Weird Way to Get Rich
How does it feel to be one of the smartest people on the Internet? Pretty good, right? Yeah, we thought so. Since you're a genius, we know you haven't wasted your time with all these cryptocurrencies everyone is talking about like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or Coinye West. Nope. Not you. You're waiting for something better. Allow us to introduce you to the most valuable altcoin on the market. It's called Egg Rolls.
Why should I invest in Egg Rolls, you're probably asking. The appetizer market is booming right now, and Egg Rolls are delicious. OK, but what do I do with them? Simple. Just order them with Eat24, then eat them. Or trade them with a friend for something else, like Onion Rings. The possibilities are endless.
The best part about Egg Rolls is that they're accepted everywhere. Because who doesn't love Egg Rolls? So invest in some Egg Rolls from Eat24 this weekend, and we'll give you your first one for free*.

There will be 21 million bitcoins eventually. Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places. The goxcoins may or may not end up back in circulation. It's not fair for you to say they are lost yet. They are definitely inaccessible for now.
Your point is that because gox happened bitcoin is doomed. I think the opposite. I feel that is galvanizes better security practices. Gox became  by sheer luck and opportunity. They had a chance to be wonderful and the squandered it. 
Gox is the equivalent of a Bernie madoff. You can argue with some irrelevant numbers and percentages if you want but it doesn't make you right.

I hope Ross and his lawyer drag every piece of information regarding the failure of the drug war into public record. 
The drug war is an abhorrent failure and drugs are not inherently bad. Bad habits, lack of education, and a desire to party more and harder than anyone else is killing people. Not to mention raids, jail time, and wasted judicial processing time. 
End the stupid war so we can buy Legal LSD and Cocaine with warning labels and packaging that provides education. 
Ideally, I wish they would allow sales of controlled substances *after* taking an hour long class on the drug and the effects.  Education works better than prohibition. 
Imagine the tax dollars and employment opportunities. Watch the gangs vanish as employment becomes a reality for more people.

Every wall can be climbed over. The desire to produce new mining machines will force innovation. That's how it's always gone. Things are progressing even if the price has gone down.

They are not part of the government sir. But they would really like you to think so.
The twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by Congress as the operating arms of the nation's central banking system, are organized much like private corporations--possibly leading to some confusion about "ownership." For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan; dividends are, by law, 6 percent per year.

The War on computer piracy is only 5-10 years old. It's also hard to gauge since the money they spent is private and the government's is public.
I simply don't think it's a matter of how much money is thrown at the problem. It's two different beasts. Men on the ground aren't needed as much for piracy. Just some techs and some lawyers with subpeonas. 
Keep in mind that the collective amount that the MPAA and RIAA have sued for is greater than the amount of money in circulation. The Riaa wanted 70 trillion dollars or something for lime wire...

Most places like coinbase or bitpay will provide transactions with only 1-2 confirmations instead of the usual 6.  (If I'm incorrect, please let me know)
They take the risk of someone trying to cheating the system, but this is rare and it's typically on purchases that are small. But in all honesty, it's a fair thing to have to wait an hour or so to transfer 10k as an example. That is still LESS and CHEAPER than traditional banking methods.

someone can buy an alt coin and exchange it for btc and then sell the alt right back. Like doge. 
Lose a little in the process maybe.
Now if LEO's identify the owners positively of an address, they can watch some money move but they have no way to determine where something has moved and why without context and other info. 
Honeypots are possible. But if mixers didn't work there would be a lot of people on right now complaining about their accounts being shut down for using darknets.

I just started using Purse recently. I have 2 orders done and saved 15-20% on each one. I'm not shilling for them or anything. I really think they stumbled upon a really excellent concept.
Not everyone has easy access to Bitcoins and most people use amazon. Using your credit card in exchange for Bitcoin access is genius the way they set it up here...

I look forward to someone linking me to a comprehensive easy to read list that lists the inputs and outputs offchain and on chain from Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, etc. It would be a must to have a list of transfers or proof of transfers of fiat currencies to the miners personal registered bank account.  Since Coinbase and others have offchain transfers, it's hard to even monitor that side of things.
Until then, "extemely easy" doesn't quite cut it. 
I don't care that much. I'm just saying, are the miners really selling every single coin they get? Obviously the mining companies take bitcoin so why not keep it in bitcoin to buy more miners.

Sorry guy I've been watching piracy for 10+ years. I've been through suprnova, oink, usenet, Limewire, Kazaa, etc. 
[The estimated damages from piracy are quite high.]( Of course the estimates are provided by the copyright lobby so take this with a grain of salt.
The costs are private and we have no way to determine how much money has been spent on  the war on piracy.
The war on Piracy didn't ramp up until Napster. It really didn't. 
We're arguing an irrelevant point. The point is that the MPAA/copyright lobby spends a fat chunk of change on anti-piracy measures. Regardless if it's 1 billion or 100 billion. 
The war on drugs is a physical product, not a digital one therefore less resources need to be directed to it's interdiction. But it's still in the billions, just like the drug war.

-Found Bitcoin in 2011. Really interested. Could not figure out how to buy any. Mining was complicated and the blockchain took forever to download.
-Graduated college and was given an immediate job offer working 40 hours a week with lots of overtime. Forgot about Bitcoin until May 2013 but did not jump in until November 2013.
-Started jumping in. First failed attempt on Coinbase was at $70. I regret not putting more time into it. 
-Saw the light towards the end of november and began purchasing with each paycheck. Accrued 6 BTC or so.
-Fell for a scam on Xmas Eve and lost 5 BTC. One of the dumbest things I've ever done with my time. But it taught me the important lessons of how fluid Bitcoin is and to trust no one. It had not really occurred to me how much 5 Bitcoin was and it just seemed like simple number on a screen until it happened. Best learning experience financially I've ever had. 
-Started writing privately about it. Sharing with my friends. Tipping from time to time. 
-Almost every chance I get I donate bits to various charities to show them the sharing community is possible.

Bitcoin can't be regulated. But as long as people want FIAT they will be forced to go to some point (ATM or Exchange). The mechanisms that allow it to relate to FIAT in the current system is easy to regulate.
So. As usual. The exchanges are the weakpoint. 
Taxes could also be levied unfairly on Bitcoin transactions.

Voting is a sacred task for some people. Especially the old folks who grew up during the 50's and 60's. Any changes to "the normal flow and tradition of things" will be met with heavy resistance. 
It took a lot of old ignorant voters dying to get marijuana passed in Seattle, and that was a major non-constitutional issue to do relatively speaking.. It will take more to change the voting status quo on a meaningful scale. Not including the federal government ceding voting power to a block chain technology.

Marc Andreessen, a major venture capitalist that has invested in Bitcoin, stated, “Bitcoin is a classic network effect, a positive feedback loop. The more people who use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin is for everyone who uses it, and the higher the incentive for the next user to start using the technology.”
Bitcoin is moving forward in an upward spiral. The more people there are using the currency, the more stable the value becomes, and the more stable the value is, the more people there are willing to use the currency. While this is currently very positive, the opposite can also happen.
this hurts my head.

The Federal Reserve at it's root is the cause and solution to all of the US's problems. Every war. Every program. Every conflict. Created by the massive credit line the Fed provides us.

The purchasing power of a dollar has undoubtedly fallen. What could a nickel buy in 1900? What can it buy today?
90-97% is a fair guess, it was a quick google search. I'm not going to argue that point. The point is that *most* money is digital. 
The fed enables the government to borrow endlessly on the futures of our young and stick them with the bill. Fiat as a system is hopelessly broken and our ballooning debt is going to become a problem sooner or later. The Fed is also a private entity subject to it's own whims and has almost no oversight or transparency. Which simply is no good at this point. 
Bitcoin is volatile. So are stocks. Doesn't mean they aren't useful. Long term Bitcoin has been an excellent store of value and most early adopters have made a few thousand percent in profit. Depends on your perspective. But the one thing that is stable is the issuance of currency and the consistency of the system. We know how Bitcoin will behave for the most part for decades out or longer unlike our current banking system which is managed behind closed doors. 
The wars of our time (WWI. WWII. Every Police action since including Iraq and Afghanistan) have all been funded by the ease at which the US government can continually print money and always find more and more money. Isn't it funny how last year they were ready to shut the government down for lack of funds and this year we have enough to go bomb some more third world countries? 
Before central banking garnering funds for a war was a tricky process involving fundraising and networking. Now they can just print the money. Need more? Print it! 
In regards to war and money, I suggest you review history where all treasure and booty is otherwise plundered to feed soldiers and pay them.
 All wars are for the wealthy as they are the only whom benefit. A bottomless money supply must end and Bitcoin can enter the scene. Watch our governments spend their money on war when they cannot print more.

This is speculation but the reason that Amazon doesn't ship to as many countries internationally is both for legal, and financial reasons. Some places simply are either too risky to ship to, or are countries with significant numbers of Credit Card Fraud.
With bitcoin there is no fraud. OS has their money confirmed and they ship the goods. The rest is on the shipper.

I just keep in mind that within a decade or less most coins will be mined.
Just imagine what happens to the market when there's coins needed and a very finite supply. 
Keep in mind that many coins have been lost, stolen, burned, or are being watched by various entities for movement. Some would probably consider them as "hot coins" that aren't as easy to spend. 
So I would wager that at least a million coins or more will be lost by the time they are all mined.

Firstly. Good on you. I'm glad you made some serious progress under the broken system we have now. Not many have the mental aptitude to do it. So kudos. 
My self and my family has also taken similar steps. Prudent investments with lots of information. 
I've made many mistakes (I just took a $3000 loss on some stocks I bought 5 years ago).
But. What happens when your government liquidates your cash to pay for a bailout?
What happens when your government borrows money from your great grand children to pay for a war?
What happens when your government says you can only take out $100 a day?
"That won't happen." It has happened. Many times through history. 
See. The paradigm as a whole has worked for you. You followed the rules, were patient, and thought stuff through. Good work. 
But it's 2014. The internet needs it's own currency. Even if it isn't bitcoin we need options because we have a broken system with unethical tyrants grandfathered in.

"The Federal Reserve uses open-market operations to either increase or decrease reserves. To increase reserves, the Federal Reserve buys U.S. Treasury securities by writing a check drawn on itself. The seller of the Treasury security deposits the check in a bank, increasing the seller's deposit. The bank, in turn, deposits the Federal Reserve check at its district Federal Reserve bank, thus increasing its reserves" [ 1 ] When a bnak increases it's reserves it can loan more money due to the magic of fracional reserve banking.
"When the Federal Reserve writes a check for a government bond it does exactly what any bank does, it creates money, it created money purely and simply by writing a check." [ 2 ]

There's a lot of great videos on Youtube but let me explain it best I can.
Fractional reserve banking means you only need to have a fraction of actual cash on hand. But it provides the ability to print money endlessly. In theory, your money is backed by the Us government. It used to be backed by gold.
As time went on, we essentially handed corporations a blank check. They provide us needed services (such as weapons for war, subsidies, etc etc) but it also means we can spend beyond our means.
It's a credit card for our government that never has to be paid off in any of our life times. 
Printing more money that's backed by nothing but the government's word eventually leads to inflation. A loss of value. $1 is still $1. But ask anyone from 1914 what $1 used to buy and you will see the problem.
If we were spending the money on our citizens, it would be different. But we essentially use this system to prop up a broken system and provide corporate handouts. 
"Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws."

The cost of mining pales in comparison to the cost of the central banking system. 
To boot, it will generate new chipsets and computer technologies, sustainability projects, recycling of electronics, and create jobs. 
Electronics will get faster. The recycling process will become simpler. 
It's easy to look at a number and be like "oh wow thats a big number".
You have no idea of the scale of the implications involved here if Bitcoin is ever applied on a larger scale. 
If someone comes up with a better model for it. Hell yeah.

-Any of his writing shows he doesn't have the same level of english comprehension and doesn't match his previous writing styles
-Source for libertarian views? Not relevant regardless. 
-Lots of people are secretive. Especially when their entire life has been dragged into the limelight. 
-an unknown stranger knocking on his door. some people don't like talking to strange people. especially in california.
Also, you don't think SN might have planned for this contingency that someone might come looking for him? You really think you would be able to find him in the phone book?!
Satoshi was a long term planner and he knew people would come looking for him. 
Need more evidence.

A good start would be using the method discussed on the front page of Bitcoin.
I also think it would be good to provide more information in regards to "how" you came to your deductions and an appeals process or a strike system. Coinbase is an amazing service all around but it's unfortunate that it has to bend to the whims of a legacy system. Both of finance, and personal use of funds. 
In regards to your Multi-Sig I remember reading some critiques about it. 
I'm not moving quantities of methamphetamines or selling kiddy porn by any regard. But if I buy a $20 bag of weed from a friend can my account be shut down if Coinbase somehow finds out? Does this mean that if Coinbase gets a notice they can freeze and hold funds? 
I think Coinbase, and other Bitcoin companies are in a unique position to demand change to KYC laws because of the amazing changes Bitcoin allows for. I like Coinbase. A lot. I really don't want you guys to turn into a Bitcoin Bank, but a pioneer of decentralized systems. 
I would really like to see stealth addresses put into place. If not, people will just use tumblers or (eventually) dark wallet. Coinbase is still supplying the darknet whether your company cares to admit it. Just go over to and you will see the posts suggesting Coinbase &gt; DNM wallets. 
The reality is that the money laws of the past century...some of them are going to be made useless due to the realities of technology. The same way piracy has torn apart the understanding of content value. 
I see great things for Coinbase but at the same time, it makes me nervous to see stories of losing access and extensive transaction monitoring. If you're really trying to, "[make] bitcoin simple to use for mainstream consumers and businesses." then don't give them the impression that their transactions are being watched and scrutinized on a regular basis. 
I think the reality is that you need to design a system that makes it impossible for Coinbase to see where transactions are going. Just eliminate the problem of KYC by making your platform privacy based. Track the bitcoin going into an account from a Bank. No problem. But no further.
Maybe what I speak of is illegal and/or impossible. But I'm utopian like that.

The money laundering potential for it is extra-ordinary. 
Make money illegally. Tumble coins. Deposit bits on purse, send Amazon swag to someone else's address. Buy medium-large items like Ipads and TV's. Things that can be resold on craigslist easily. 
 No one is going to question Amazon's supply chain so your packages aren't likely to get busted for being sent to anon addresses. Fraudulent goods likely aren't as easily found like drugs are. Keep using different accounts. Keep it going.
Hell you pay people by offering them half the cost of selling it on CL. People can get organized and do this easily if they decided to.
There's no KYC laws with Purse yet. But there will be.
The credit card fraud potential is massive as well. I think that's partially why they are using the ratings system on their users.

I wish people would stop asking for more women in Bitcoin. All you're going to do is try to hit on them at a conference. 
If there are PEOPLE regardless of their sex they will make themselves known through their skills. Don't give them more attention and impact based on their gender.

No greed. I'm not here for money. As I posted earlier today.

Bitcoin is the currency of the internet. Decentralized. Controlled by no one. Influenced by many.
Edit: Starting a conversation with "you're not going to convince me" is equal to saying to "no matter what the evidence you show me is I won't change my mind." You are no different than a creationist if you take this road in terms of information assimilation. 
Long story short. The federal reserve and fractional reserve system has done more damage than mining will ever could hope to.

You have to realize that as bitcoin transitions from a niche market of tech enthusiasts to a the mainstream our demographic and the IQ level will drop a few points.

This is going to be a long term project. But I think it's a reality. 
Society has gotten too big to be managed effectively by a centralized government.
We have too many old people to make it viable. But over the next 20 years as the tech generation starts to come into more of a voting age we will see crypto being hoisted. We must wait for the old to die.
The first battle is getting "permission" to decentralize the functions of government because at the end of the day, they are the gate keepers for now. From there we must teach all peoples how to use it. If we can teach a world how to use cell phones, we can teach decentralization. Good ideas spread and become easier to use with time. See: Car, internet, Facebook, texting, online banking.

Right. Lazy. 
-Dollars do not hold value. The value of the dollar has fallen drastically in the last 50 years. Look up Purchasing Power. 
-You're right. 97% of all money is digital and is subject to the control and power of the gate keepers. 
-Rich people aren't bad people. Maybe out of touch, but many of them are good people. 
The fed creates credit by creating more money when they run out. We bail out negligent banks. We make the value of money irrelevant by generating money in situations where it would not otherwise be available. With Bitcoin we would actually have to budget and keep track of funds instead of bottomless spending. 
The wars of our times would not be possible with out the massive credit bubble and money supply that the fed enables and creates. Without central banking we could not afford to be at war every other year. Period. Not to mention that the Fed controls the issuance of the currency and the amount of interest on it to lenders. 
I'm a very open minded person and I know when to admit I'm wrong when presented with evidence, but you're an idiot if you think that the Fed is being honest and not the root cause of our financial issues.

If mining bitcoins creates the money that funds that cancer research you might sing a different tune. 
So what do you think about Seti @ Home? 
Your position is incredibly unfounded. Mining may seem on the surface somewhat wasteful. But it's literally creating a digitial arms race for the fastest computing. It is changing our currency system. 
So let's look at this semi mathematically.
(All of the pain and suffering of our current financial system. Including the entitlements and mounting debt percentage. + a shitty method of money transfer + an entire economy surrounding it + a lot of people who hate their shitty banking jobs.)
This when added up in dollars, cents, man hours, and emotional pain is un measurable. It's huge. It's a massive pain. 
The cost of mining relative to the carnage caused by our current system is much less. Look at miners as the processor the transactions. They are the tellers and bankers making everything happen. Except we know exactly how the mining happens. We can't predict bankers behavior. Bailouts. Or corporate handouts. 
Mining is not inherently bad, it's just in it's early stages. 
It needs to be more sustainable and efficient. I agree. But your position of "I don't like it and it makes me angry" would likely change if you were holding mining equipment or a large amount of BTC.
I would do some more research on mining and get back to us.
@_date: 2014-02-11 09:06:11

Why would I want to buy a car when there are no roads built, or car insurance to cover me in case of a collapse?
You need to stop seeing problems as problems, but instead as opportunities for innovation.
A lot of these issues are starting to be worked out and already on some of the Darknet I see customer service experiences that rival major retailers. 
Over time there will be bitcoin based credit cards, chargebacks already exist via merchant processers. 
The value? A deflationary currency that is able to be sent across the globe instantly and when appropriate steps are taken, cannot be seized or taken by any government. Similar to burying a bar of gold in your back yard, but more portable. 
It also provides a means of identification and verification. 
If Henry Ford invented the car today he would be facing similar hurdles and problems and it's incredibly short sighted for you or anyone else to take this position. The things you compare it to have decades of practice and experience not to mention funding...
Fiat currency as a whole is flawed and dangerous and an alternative is needed. Bitcoin is impartial. It's formula will remain pretty much the same for the next 200 years with some minor tweaks here and there to the network. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:06:31
Exactly. If they were using bitcoin, we would know where all taxpayer funds are and where they go. All transactions are tracked and logged. 
If there's a US operation and no coverage of where the funds come from, we get to ask questions and have evidence :-)
currently, the CIA sells cocaine (biggest open secret in washington) to fund it's black ops.

I upvoted this, but I don't think that Andreas is culpable in most regards here.
Holding someone responsible for the reckless and unpredictable behavior of another person 5000 miles away from him is a bit of a stretch IMO.
Definitely want to hear more about Andreas' role here but I don't think he is a suitable person to point a finger at.
I think Andreas' should specialize and start his own Bitcoin security auditing company. That's my two cents. His name in and of itself is becoming a brand image and he could easily secure funding for his own private company to audit and secure bitcoin related entities. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 01:40:29
That was due to Ross's own stupidity most likely. Not Bitcoin. They found his private keys.

I'm fairly certain that Edward Snowden is part of a limited hangout operation. I'd love to be wrong. But he never leaks anything important. Just things most of us already knew.

It's simple. Each department of government would have their own wallet address publicly identifiable. They would annually receive their budget and from there each department would be responsible for identifying the subsequent transactions from that point onward.
Some items could still remain classified for national security purposes it's a matter of identifying and tracking the funds though.

@_date: 2014-08-27 16:40:16
LOL. Right. How much value has the US dollar lost in the last 100 years? 
The USD is only seemingly stable because of the establishments in place to keep order and keep stacking the house of cards. 
BTC has been volatile in the past, but for the most part we enjoy great stability now. Depending when you bought in, you're still several hundred percent up.
Going back to OP though, the price isn't that important. The thing is that just like gold, providing a specific amount of weight doesn't tell you much. But comparing it to a currency gives a user a more "local" impression of the value.
In the future that could change, but we will see.

I should clarify. My bad. They had central/national banks. But they were not under the same management of the Rothschild family. I apologize for not framing this correctly. 
So yes. You are right. They had central banks longer than I mentioned. Not what I was intending to communicate. 
But now they pay interest to the "right people". 
I do fact check and when presented with evidence I change my mind. I have no problem with changing my pre-conceived notions when new information is presented. 
But the world is a big fucking private financial club and we are not in it. I do not trust central bankers. I do not think they have given us a reason to trust them. I don't know why anyone would go along with central banking when Andrew Jackson exhausted his political capital fighting them. 
I am against systems that can endlessly print worthless money based on the premise of faith in a country. We fund terrorists and the money supply created by the Fed enables this to occur. It's happened over and over and over in history and everyone turns a blind eye.

I had this thought a long time ago. There should be a disclaimer that any violent means not initiated by the bounty seeker will disqualify you.

This is a huge step in providing advanced level options alongside newbie tools for all skill levels.
I wonder what the Federal Government response will be if any. Because now they can't seize Coinbase coins that use this service.
My question is will Coinbase be *able* to stop a transaction per KYC regluations? Or is this a legit multi-sig situation? For example, if I choose to buy drugs on the darknet or launder money and Coinbase identifies my account as flagged for illegal uses.....will they be able to stop the transaction?

The other pools are centralized points. There are people in the community worried about 51% attacks (where 1 pool gets 51% of the mining power).

Still unproven with little evidence. Further, it seems the the DEA was in charge of SR at large during this "fake murder" they set up. 
They haven't proven how they know it was Ross and not someone else and the defense has had almost all of their arguments quashed.
If the murders were provable they would have tried him for murder instead of running the market IMO. 
Further, why would ross use a non-bitcoin money transfer using normal money when he had a pile of Bitcoin to pay with easily?

Doubtful. The US sees Bitcoin as a positive. Anything they do to BTC is going to be a very very light touch because otherwise we will simply do business on other exchanges via a VPN. 
What will probably eventually happen is a system where there are no exchanges just exchange pools that all owners benefit from. 
Personally, I don't like having BTC exchanged only by a handful of exchanges. There needs to be more points of entry to the market.
All of these things are issues that need to be solved long term, and they will be.
Bitcoin is pretty sweet though man. I've spent 3 years watching it.

There are normal users and some idiots need help. See: Walmart Greeters. 
The grand majority of us that care enough to do so know how to function without the intermediary third parties (Coinbase, Gox, etc) unless we need to pay with them. We will buy our coins and sell them using our own tools.
The government is going to realize quickly that this currency is designed by the internet. Not by them. People will figure ways around every instance of their impediments to make the system harder and already have begun doing so.
See: Bitcoin Tumblers, VPNs, Craigslist, and other tools that haven't even been invented yet.
Bitcoin is a raw store of value. I wish I had more and I will be buying more. It works. It's simple. It has the power to at bare minimum provide us with a new starting point for a new financial paradigm for the people, by the people.

I am on the side of the people. Corporations are made up of people. But they are not people. It is completely possible for corporations to be good honest and human entities. 
Consider please that coinbase is still a startup and not full blown corp yet. they simply don't have the resources to do what they need to do right now. they need more hiring asap.

Or it forces miners to adapt. I look forward to seeing some of the ingenuity that they use for solving the problems facing them. Sustainable energy for starters would be fun. Some miners have already moved to areas with geo-thermal energy to cut costs.
Not to mention the direct financial motivation for miners created by Bitcoin *someone* *somewhere* is innovating a new design for miners and will share it with the world, *probably* 
At some point, the transaction fee might be increased. I'm a fan of this thought. I have no qualms about using larger transaction fees.

I'll do something similar until my holdings hit over $100k. That's when you get a lawyer involved. 
The thing about safes is, it's a great way of telling anyone in your home where your valuables are. 
All it takes is one wrong person to get a look at it and tell their 10 friends, and wait till you go on vacation.
A trustless deadman switch would be amazing though. 
Enter a password every 365 days or sign a transaction or the coins automatically move  to a pre-determined address. Say the wallet of your lawyer to inform your family. 
Your family can decide to keep or sell.

It takes about an hour for each transaction. That's normal. Often times if you go through a merchant processer it takes about 5 seconds though since they use 0 confirmation.

Back in 2014 (I think) someone dumped 30,000 coins  on the market when the price was on it's way down from it's previous ATH in 2013/early 2014. Someone thought the party was over and decided to cash out. 
Gotta wonder what happened to them or if they bought back in.
When you dump such a bulk of coins on the market you dominate the price a short time and many traders ate up all the cheap coins. 
I like this video of the market action.
If someone dumped 30k coins on the market today at $800 a piece the price would probably crash for a short time.

Impaired drivers? Drugs didn't do that. People made those choices. Lack of community resources for ride sharing, or public transit options so that driving intoxicated can be avoided.

I don't think you're understanding me at all. 
If he did it. I want him brought to justice. 100%. Murder for hire, even for a project as illustrious as the Silk Road is not cool. It's against all the values I feel many of it's users believe in. 
That having been said, I've seen the hundreds of articles and court documents. I still don't understand how they are proving he tried to have someone killed. Please. Link me. Show me what you're talking about. I'd love to see it and read it. 
In regards to the Green's death thing. I hadn't heard of it till now. I'm gonna do some reading on it tonight. 
At the end of the day my opinion is worthless and just words on a screen. I'm here speculating like the rest of us. 
My personal belief is that Ross is guilty of doing Silk Road, but innocent in murder for hire. I'll need to see more evidence but I appreciate the reading for tonight. But if the evidence shows otherwise I'll change my tune. That's a promise. 
Maybe I haven't gone into it as much depth as required and you're 100% right. 
I don't hate justice. I hate when justice is applied where it is unneeded or for political gain of others. 
Even *if* Ross is guilty of orchestrating murder he still started the first Bitcoin Drug market. That's a major life accomplishment and in and of itself is quite a feat. Many of us will continue to respect that aspect of his life. But Ross also potentially chose to end someone's life to protect his own interests. Not the first time it's happened. If that's how it played out, I can understand the pressure, intensity, and panic that must have driven that decision. 
I can empathize with his situation, but don't think for a moment I accept it. If he orchestrated murder, throw the book at him. But I'm still unsure on the evidence of the situation. 
Edit: do you have any good sources to read on Green?
Edit: I would actually compare Ross to OJ Simpson. The defendant everyone thinks *might* be guilty but publicly cheers on until something confirms it in a visceral fashion.

Go to your local precious metals shop. Buy some silver or gold that's easy to offload.
Head over to and sell the metals for bitcoin. there are people there that will trade if you ask.
You can get BTC without giving anyone an ID or Bank account and semi-anonymously.
You may get some price slippage due to shipping times/market changes but that could go in your favor or against.

You can do Coinbase. Hook up a debit card/bank account and they will pull the money and send you Bitcoin.

A fat man named Mark K with a latte addiction, a fat cat, and a habit of being vague to his users made off with a lot of Bitcoin. 
He was the first exchange for Bitcoin, but he also had no regulation on his whole operation, no security experience, refused all external help, and then suddenly people wanted their coins and he blamed a hack. Recent news seems to indicate it was an inside operation and Mark has been fairly quiet, and free. It doesn't look like he will be facing any consequences.

Bitstamp has gone out of their way to be legit this whole time. They've made the announcements they need to. They have guaranteed all deposits.

This is kind of how I view it. A lot of people bought in and held anticipating $10,000 a coin by the end of the year. No one stopped to say, "oh hey, the price might be inflated." Now the bottom half of the speculators who were hodling are cashing out. 
That's fine and dandy. I bought in large. I'll buy in small. BTC is still going to be useful and valuable for some time to come.
Bitcoin is still going to the moon, I have no doubts. But the price has to come down and equalize. We'll see what the price does when the next halving comes and the availability of coins diminishes.

Independant vendors. SR was a platform. You don't blame the Manhattan Project for someone else's decision to drop the bomb. That's the price of true freedom.
The hitman listings were unverified and not one case of their use has surfaced, nor do I recall seeing CP on SR at any point in time.
Identity theft stuff and carding equipment? Yeah Okay. I will acknowledge I'm not a fan of that, but freedom is freedom. Ross's platform was about liberty through capitalism. Besides in this sub we should be acknowledging that CC's are insecure and easily faked, hence why we use Bitcoin.

Ross is a hero. I am hoping that his story regarding the framing is true. I don't ~~think~~ **feel** he's a murderer. 
In regards to drugs. Drugs should be legal. Regulated. Clean. Locally produced when possible. Prohibition is an abject failure unless you are an authoritarian or benefit from the prison industrial process.
Silk Road was the first of it's kind allowing for consistent drug delivery with minimal issues. It was genius. No more waiting for kids to play video games while you get a sack of weed. More reliability and vendor reviews for other harder drugs like LSD, Heroin, Cocaine, etc. 
Not to mention no involvement of Gangs or Cartels (other than potentially as the original source).
SR has reduced drug related violence extensively and provided safe access to drugs that people would seek out anyway. 
The hypocrisy is astounding because the US government used to sell cocaine to Freeway Ricky Ross via Danilo Blandon to fund the iran-contra affair.
If ross is a murderer, I want him to rot in jail. If he was actually framed, he deserves to be free and should be funded for future projects. He's a smart kid and I don't think he's a bad guy.

Agreed. But the content was still on their website. Even temporarily. If Facebook or Reddit didn't exist then that content would never have been posted.


The US Government facilitates illegal/quasi-legal transactions and actions all the time. Let's lock them up too. 


Why not? The sidewalks are being used for street level drug dealing. They are hosting the content. 


My recollection was that IRS didn't even have tax laws on Bitcoin until this time last year. I won't doubt that Ross may have participated in some laundering but we will see. I'll concede that point.

Which is retarded. Silk Road is a name. It doesn't mean that the entities running it are the same ones as before. 
We have no guarantees that any other DNM isn't a FBI/DEA honeypot. 
SRR, I'm not going to use it personally, but the name wouldn't deter me from using it.
IF anything I think it's a testament to the perseverance of the idea. 
With the right features...multi-sig, enforced PGP, no mandatory FE, and all around excellent OPSEC SRR can be awesome. Good ideas will stand the test of any and all scrutiny. 
I don't think that SRR's admin should be posting. We've seen that they are very willing to use writing analysis to tie people to identities.   
Now that posting you shared with me makes me think he's a little less stable, but I'm not intent on using SRR any time soon, so I will just continue observing.

The non-short sighted way is reading the news.

A CP site is essentially a site that generates harmful abuse. I would very much like child molesters to see treatment and "face the music".
Drugs are very different from CP. When done responsibly drugs don't hurt anyone. Child Porn hurts so many families and children. I would never support a Ross Ulbricht of CP. I don't think many would.
Ross's site didn't offer CP. That needs to be clear. Ross's platform was about personal non-violent freedom. 
That's why they eventually removed guns and why CP was banned.

SR was not a platform for CP. It was a platform for anything the site deemed worthy of it's time. Most users were there for drugs imo. CP and murder for hire are not found on the recent DNM sites.

Ross had a marketplace. An impartial marketplace that sold anything and everything. He never trafficked any drugs. He just provided the sandbox for others to play in.
Do we hold the people that make sidewalks responsible for street level drug deals? They clearly facilitated the ability of it.

Fuck the OP. This post is garbage. He loves posting it everywhere. 
-How the "undercover" agent was hired for SK for an admin job. We don't have this information, we know only that he was chatting with DPR. To be admin for a web like this is not easy to be accepted. Or maybe that "admin" is the creator of the SK.
*simple* The Undercover agent spent "1000's" of hours on Silk Road Forums and built trust. In those early days before paranoia set in. this is entirely plausible. 
- If that agent has access to see the location of DPR just chatting, why they didn't localize also all the clients that used SK to sell/buy drogs. So all those users are not prosecuted... So this is the War on drogs guys, a fakery.
The agent didn't have access to the location of DPR chatting, just the time stamps.
- Do you really think that DPR will use a normal unprotected WiFi connection without any VPN protection when he was chatting or connecting to SK?
What is SK? Also, people have accessed wifi under dumber conditions. Ross probably figured that he was safe (if his story about being set up is true) for a quick visit to SR. 99% of the time he signed in, he didn't get arrested. 
- Who benefits from this?
Too many groups and entities to count. 
OP please stop smoking meth.

What a terrible article. I doubt Lyn is feeling contempt for her son, I think she's just processing the sheer volume of information being fed to her. 
The writer of this article should be shot. Lyn loves Ross through everything and this article was intended to tug at the heart strings.
My heart goes out to Ross's mother, I can't imagine what she is going through. It's not easy to hear that her son grew 10 lbs of mushrooms obviously but what a terrible thing to latch on to. Kicking a family while they are down is just a terrible thing to do to boost your own ratings and hook readers.

If every play of someone's song on a pay service costs 50-1000 bits per play then royalties could easily be collected and divided from there. 
The musicians would have a record of every bit of money they collect via bitcoin.
I envision something like soundcloud but you dump in $10 a month or something and every time you play a song it subtracts from your balance. 
On a global scale that adds up quickly. The more plays you get the more paid you get. All verifiable.

Worst case scenario? Identity theft. 
Is it likely? Probably not. 
Been in Bitcoin for years now and never heard of an exchange leaking/losing their ID database. I would imagine that the ID's are only used during the opening of accounts and then put into a form of offline storage. 
If there is a major leak of ID's I think it's likely you will be notified immediately by the company that has the leak and/or they will contact authorities involved. This gives you ample time to get a new ID with fresh numbers. 
An ID is one of many keys used to open accounts/use them for nefarious purposes.

It goes back to 2010, in which Ulbricht describes "his early plans to create Silk Road and seed it by growing psychedelic mushrooms, and selling them for cheap.

There will be a payroll tax increase, but after the savings from not paying for healthcare, you come out slightly ahead. I know there's other information online if you want to do your own research.
Basically. Your net income will stay the same if you make less than 250k a year.
Your company already offers healthcare for free? That may change with universal healthcare for all. 
Maybe providing for higher wages if your company is gangster enough.
Regardless, Sanders tax plan makes a lot of sense when you look at the big picture. 
Funding education and healthcare will do more for this country than most legislation has in the past 50 years. Less homeless people, less lives destroyed by a drug war, less lives bankrupted by medical and educational debt.
Will you see a little more off your check? Yeah you will. But you won't have to spend any of it on healthcare and at the end of the year you will come out ahead. 
Anyone paying more than $2000 a year for medical supplies or care should be thrilled with this.

1 troy ounce is 31.1035 grams.
1 Bitcoin divided by 31.1035 is 0.032150722
0.032150722 Bitcoin equals 38.32 US Dollar
Pretty close to $40. If you're going to compare it to gold grams then at least get proportional.
Why do I think it's important? Because Bitcoin is better than gold. Easier to move globally and more resistant to seizure. 
The amount of available gold is not really relevant because Bitcoin becomes more scarce over time and harder to produce.

Ask Coinbase.  We are not Coinbase. 
More than likely there's some data connected to your identity that makes you higher risk and that's why your limit is so low.
Meanwhile I have an amazing credit score, no major debt, and a clean record. I have a huge daily buying limit and and larger ACH daily limit.

It's not a bias. There was a serious hijacking of "justice" with the whole trial to make an example of him. When I see actual evidence that Ross ordered hits I will absolutely throw him under the bus. Right now, that evidence isn't really solid. The agents who supposedly arranged the murder for hire were stealing from SR and trying to cover their tracks. We still don't know if there was more than one DPR. 
But we've had this discussion before and I don't expect you to have the level of cognition to understand reasonable doubt.

It's profitable if you get the machines as soon as they roll off the line.
It's profitable if you have very dirt cheap power and low costs for operation.
It's profitable if you have a cooling advantage like mineral oil or highly efficient A/C.
Basically, it's really only worth doing if you know exactly what you're doing and how to scale your costs correctly. Or don't have a hard timeline and have to sell immediately to pay costs. 
There are at least 2 large BTC mines in WA state alone.

The mafia isn't publicly accountable. Sanders is trying to create a government that is. He understands the power of the internet and has been nothing but honest so far in his platform. He has 30 years of action to examine in his past. 
In regards to my tax money jailing people, Bernie wants to end the drug war and the prisons for profit system. 
In regards to dropping bombs all around the world, I can't see Bernie giving the clear to drone strike a wedding. Bernie is not a fan of warrantless wiretapping either. 
Taxation is not a bad thing if the tax money is not wasted on war and stupid shit. Bernie understands what a growing number of people considers waste and what is a burden worth undertaking. 
Bernie has raised no corporate money and his only obligations are to the people themselves. He's shown more empathy than any of the other candidates we have. Our other options are a Xenophobe who wants to bankrupt us like he did all of his other companies or a Wall Street insider with a pending indictment. 
Corporations are dominating us, our consciousness, and our way of life through media and banking control. Bernie is the only one saying break up the big banks.

Ultimately the process of securing these wallets takes time. Time and people breaking them. Trezor is putting up a strong face but whatever their next wallet is, it's likely going to deal with some of the vectors mentioned in the disclosures.
All of this still revolves around people finding your Trezor and then finding someone who is willing to break into your Trezor with the equipment. You don't even know if that wallet has enough in it to justify the equipment or paying the specialist to make the attack. 
Trezors/HW wallets are very small in general. Hiding them really well is pretty easy with a little thought. 
What I do worry about though is as this information spreads, people will make small simple devices to take advantage of known exploits to take the need of an expert out of the equation.

Senators Charles Schumer appointed Judge Forrest if I remember correctly.
Charles was the one who put a price on DPR's head.
That means the person that put her into her office and job had a tangible motivation and relationship with the judge to potentially pressure her into certain actions.
There was that one weekend where the alternate DPR theory was valid, and a few days later, it wasn't. The judge did a complete 360 on her position. Almost as if someone told her to void the line of questioning.
's comment is also incredibly true. There was crucial evidence involving the credibility of the agents involved with the collection of evidence against Ross. They could have EASILY delayed the trial a few weeks. The Judge chose not to.

You can sell on Bitfinex, Bitstamp, or other exchanges. If you intend to have them wire the money to you, a bank must be involved.
If you'd like to keep it simple and cash only you can do a few things. 
Mycellium local trader (android only) you can meet up somewhere safe (like a police station) and do it there. I suggest not doing more than one coin at a time with someone you've never met before. 
Local Bitcoins, either cash into your bank account or cash in person. 
Third option which would allow more volume is to go to JM Bullion or Provident metals and trade your Bitcoin for gold/silver. Once you have precious metals you can take them to your local precious metals dealer and get cash.
This option would have some price slippage due to spot price differences and your local metal shop taking a cut, but it would allow you to liquidate your coins.
Good luck.

Reposting this from another comment I made.
Armored trucks, uniforms for guards, gas for the cars, food and water for the guards. Bankers food/water, resources for their offices and large server farms. Resources burned transporting bank workers to their place of work. Resources used printing fiat, making credit/debit cards. Printing checks. Printing bank statements. Printing bank promotional materials. Managing the waste products, food, garbage, toilet waste, etc of the banking industry as a whole also takes considerable resources.
Not to mention the time, energy, and emotional cost when they fuck up and lose everyone's money and need a bailout.

If you can't keep track of 12 words in a safe deposit box or bother with a hardware wallet you have other life issues. Sorry. 
1) There are resources all over the internet. The same way with bittorrent there are multiple ways to use it. Some are safer than others. Some clients have different features than others. Some torrent sites serve different users in different ways. You simply have to decide to do the research.
2) 


That's your own damn fault. I have no sympathy for you. A few pages of reading and writing down your recovery seed would have solved that. 


It's quite simple actually. There a public key and a private key. If you lose the private key, you lose your money. 


I have a bachelors degree in something outside of tech and safely manage my coins. 
I'm going to agree with You didn't put any thought in, refused to do any research. Your last bitcoin related post on this account was 2 years ago. There were no posts to this subreddit asking how to properly and safely secure your coins or anything of the nature. 
I'm honestly not that smart. I'm pretty smart, but I'm not PHD smart and Bitcoin is second nature to me at this point. 
Even my 85 year old tecnhologically illiterate grandmother has a stronger idea of what/how Bitcoin works than you do.
If you had come to the subreddit with questions prior to buying maybe you would be singing a different tune instead of lamenting to the internet for your own laziness.

Sorry. I should have been more specific. 
I have dozens of transactions big and small to my cold storage wallets and others I have used. I've kept most of my Bitcoin. But I'd have to manually sort through hundreds of addresses to report capital gain losses. 
I just don't see a feasible way to do this considering I don't know which transactions are cold storage, which I gave away, and which I actually used to buy stuff.

It's instant if you verify your account and add a credit card. Do that stuff and it would have been instant.
You wouldn't be here complaining if you had made money instead of losing $150.
There's nothing absurd here. ACH bank transfers take a few days. 
I have coinbase instant buy. I get my coins in 5-10 seconds after submitting the buy. The ACH transaction takes 3-5 days to show up.
If you do a chargeback with your bank Coinbase will blacklist you and possibly come after you through other means for the money.

They bought in early when coins were cheap. They got investments from various sources on their about us page.

Armored trucks, uniforms for guards, gas for the cars, food and water for the guards. Bankers food/water, resources for their offices and large server farms. Resources burned transporting bank workers to their place of work. Resources used printing fiat, making credit/debit cards. Printing checks. Printing bank statements. Printing bank promotional materials. Managing the waste products, food, garbage, toilet waste, etc of the banking industry as a whole also takes considerable resources.
Not to mention the time, energy, and emotional cost when they fuck up and lose everyone's money and need a bailout.

1. Where did you buy it? 
2. Where did you send it? 
If you bought it on Coinbase then you have to wait a few days for the transaction to clear (this is fiat's slowness). Once the transaction clears the Bitcoin will be available in your account. 
Otherwise you need to contact the person who sold you the Bitcoin and ask.
If you sent it to your own wallet, assuming you copied and pasted it correctly, you should see it pending within moments.

Use CoinbasePro and you will save a ton on fees over time. Use post limit orders and you will pay 0 fees. 
If you're going to keep your funds on Coinbase (not recommended) we suggest using 2FA.

It's worth the money for peace of mind.

They bought in when it was cheap. I tried buying my first coin around 60 from them.
Back in the day you could mine them yourself easily on a CPU or GPU and get plenty. The first Bitcoin transaction was for a pizza. 25,000 bitcoins. Imagine what you could have bought straight cash from someone. Even $1000 would get you a large chunk of coins during the early days.
If they got even 10000 coins when they were starting up and some investor money they had a position to begin doing what they do now.
They definitely buy from the exchange and mark up. no doubts there.

This chart gets posted regularly without taking in a few things into account.
- Exchanges are holding a ton of Bitcoin either temporarily or long term for users that are not wise enough to get their own storage solution going. 
- HD wallets allow for large volumes of Bitcoin to be spread out amongst a lot of wallets as a security measure. 
- There's a lot of lost Bitcoin or Bitcoin that hasn't moved in years that we're not sure is still controlled or not. 
So this chart really tells us nothing other than users need to stop keeping their Bitcoin on exchanges.

Negative interest rates are the epitome of what is wrong with our financial system. 
Pay interest just to hold your cash (not even going to touch on custodianship).
This isn't a big deal if you have $10k or less in the bank. But it starts adding up, especially when you get into larger numbers. 
Your options are to invest or take the hit.
Inflation + Negative interest rates give you no choice but to invest your money.
Every year...3-5% inflation + negative interest guaranteed or take a risk on in the stock market? 
Treasury notes won't let you beat inflation but they will let you beat negative interest rates. 
People wonder why Bitcoin is a good idea when it doesn't pay dividends.

If you are putting Bitcoin into an IRA you are betting that it will be worth something in 40 years when you retire. Which means all of the gains on what you put in are taxable. 
With a ROTH you pay no more taxes on the gains when you withdraw the money. 
With a normal IRA you will pay a lot of taxes if Bitcoin goes to the moon.

Because when you generate that paperwallet there are places your private key can be intercepted. Unless you are decent with computers and REALLY know how to ensure complete security with your private keys it can result in a theft. 
Hardware wallets are completely offline and generate their keys offline. That makes them far safer for generating new wallets.
Hardware wallets are industry standard for many large firms and companies.

The best way to secure your Bitcoin is not to leave it on hot wallets with simple passwords and emails. Even with 2FA you're still trusting the third party to not be compromised. 
Storing your own keys on a hardware wallet or other secure implementation using the actual security bitcoin provides is far safer. 
No one on this planet currently has the tech to brute force your wallet open unless you give up some key pieces of information.
Emails and passwords are terrible mechanisms of security. 2FA helps obviously.
The moral of the story is not your keys, not your coin.
Don't keep huge amounts on exchanges. Even with strong passwords and 2FA you're still taking a risk.

Each dollar you get in lending has the potential to double or quadruple.
Or if the price falls, it provides you a bit of cushioning. 
Relatively safe investment.
Start with 1 BTC and try it. See how much you make. Scale up if you like it.

and sometimes it's fraud prevention or something else. Their fraud prevention triggers are impartial and your account or payment methods may have tripped something. It might be your bank, your card, or some of the information you provided. Happens all the time in my place of work and we handle a lot of payments every day. You really don't understand the scale of fraud going on in this global world. 
Most users don't have any issues and don't report them, but people who have one thing go wrong come and yell "facism" like coinbase is the third reich of Bitcoin.
It's ridiculous. 
Go use Circle, eventually you may run into the same issue there. Or use LocalBitcoins and pay a premium above the price.

Spending $60-$100 for financial security on a good hardware wallet isn't a waste of money. 
A trezor with a cryptosteel backup would be the best way to secure it. 
If you have access to a solid steel milling machine you can make your own cold storage wallet but unless you own it and know how to run it it's not worth it. 
If you want to go cheap with it, you can print a paper wallet out but unless you know how to guarantee that no one intercepts your private key, a hardware wallet is the best choice.
If you have over $1000 in BTC i suggest owning a hardware wallet.

If the devs of your wallet took crowd funding and ran off with it with no form of return for investors then they are not "one of the best wallets". Not even an update on what's happening for the investors. (No, I didn't invest.)
I was a diehard Mycelium fan for a long time. 
Their continual silence and limited PR. Prioritizing a Bcash module. The crowdfund snafu. Over a year late adding Segwit. Their continual addition of scammy coin advertisements in the app.
These are not the hallmarks of a "best wallet". Currently. But maybe they will change some day. 
Admittedly, I like their GUI and the Trezor connectivity. 
If Mycelium went transparent and explained everything that's happened in detail for the last 2 years with complete honesty I'd be open to giving them another shot. 
Right now the only way to find out what's happening with Mycelium is to look at their Github which is admittedly active. Giszmo posts updates here too once in a while as well as he did in this thread. 
I'd very much prefer Samourai has competition. But Mycelium doesn't even come close right now.
The privacy features and Bitcoin maximalist mindset that Samourai is bringing by comparison is way ahead of the competition.

No I wasn't I just kind of assumed that the city government would have tapped into some of the talent that's in san fran for tech. 
Even passively. It would honestly be such good PR for some of the larger, local, and trusted IT security firms to proactively reach out to public places like this and provide basic help with restructuring their plans in case of a hacking incident. 
Public services like hospitals and transit should have regular and very public security audits for this kind of thing. Hacking will always happen, but we can ensure better footing for public services in handling these threats ahead of time.

Interesting question.
Followed by mine, how do you determine how much BTC to give to someone? By USD (or your local currency).
The IRS is about to open an entire can of worms I feel and when they see the utter clusterfuck of a situation Bitcoin taxes are about to be...I am hopeful for change. 
If I sell 10k worth of BTC for USD, sure. I should pay taxes on my gains. I can get that. But when you use btc like a currency, especially locally, you already pay taxes. Now you have to pay an additional tax because you used BTC as a currency.

There's 21 million coins programmed into the algorithim. If someone were to increase that number the price of BTC would crash overnight. It is not in the interests of the devs to do this. You can read the code and know what protocol of bitcoin someone is running on the mining network. In order to make any fundamental changes to the BTC network you would need miner consensus and that is VERY hard to do. 
The network will only issue 21 million. There's currently 16 million.

It used to be easier to sell your bitcoin for cash as an underground means of value transfer. Now it can land you in jail.. it didn't use to be like that. 
Bitcoin's primary pull is its efficacy as a store of value over time. Which does attract "money people". But it does also attract people who want to make money legally. 
So the echo chamber begins to echo things that fit with legal money vibe.  
The people who were interested in criminal banking/government are still here. They've either been silenced by fear, financial gain, or have generally gone quiet.

They can treat it like drugs. If they really want to. 
If buying BTC can land you 10 years in jail (unlikely) it will increase the price 10 fold. Just like drugs. 
A kilo of blow costs about ~ $500 to create and transport if you're a coca farmer in Colombia. That's just a ballpark number, but it does not cost very much. What gives cocaine or other drugs their value is the fact that every part of the supply line takes on risk and each hop those drugs make, someone takes a cut. By the time it gets to the end user the price is 40,000 a kilo (depending on where you live). 
The same will happen to Bitcoin if this ban happens. The market in the US will go underground, some people will sell, and some will continue holding in secret. In the mean time anyone outside the country can send BTC into the country, but how will you get money out if we live in a cashless society or gold/silver exports are restricted? 
Banning Bitcoin could possibly be one of the best things to happen to it in the US because it would only show how powerful it can be.

Agree. That's why should make them white markets. Legalize and regulate.


We're in the middle of the biggest opiate epidemic in history. People of all races are dying from the consequences of the drug war. 
We have 60 years of data showing that prohibition doesn't work. 
"your people" have unfortunately been pushed into the consequences that the drug war started. 
There's a profit motive to sell bad dirty drugs, there's a profit motive to kill anyone that gets in the way of that process.

Highly libertarian. Privacy minded. Avid mix of people looking to save money, make money, and code tech for the blockchain. People who want to try a new way of organizing public goods. Separate from government, fair playing field, and consistency. 
Politics and money go hand in hand. We just spent 1.3 billion on our shitty election in the states. Policy changes in government affect how people work with Bitcoin. For example the IRS is looking to scrape Coinbase's user transaction files and that unfortunately affects 40% of this sub. Many people here have used Coinbase, at least in the early days of Bitcoin. Many people have spent bits on illegal sites, or gambled, lost/scammed out of their coins. It means that a potential tax headache may hit a large portion of Bitcoin buyers. Stories like this are why we tend to be politically active. Because our self interest in wealth preservation can vary based on our attention span to government.
Some people are traders. Some people are evading taxes/excercising their right to privacy and buying/selling underground. Some people are "Hodlers" who hold their coins for long term gain. Some people are vendors who can't accept credit cards. Some people are third world folks who can't get a bank account. 
The big players are the medium-large size companies that help develop the ecosystem. 
Coinbase, 21co, purse, OKCoin, Bitstamp, trezor, bitfinex, all of the mining pools, the core developers,  Wallet devs too. The large exchanges as well are big players since they are caretakers for some of the largest amounts of BTC in the world. 
Every bank is investigating Bitcoin and trying to figure out how to work with it or something similar. 
The grand bulk of the community I think it is fair to say, wants a decentralized uncensorable protocol method that benefits the world for commerece and encourages saving.

Yep. It's a horrible system. Prohibition created the profit motivation for that blood to be spilled to traffic those drugs to different parts of the world. Sucks. But it would have existed on any market place. It's not the fault of the market, but the fault of the people disabling a free legal market from operating. 


It's not really relevant to the overall point. Link if you want. But there were victimless vendors selling acid pot and shrooms and there were the less than savory people selling stolen identities and the such. That's what libertarian marketplaces bring. 


Prohibition doesn't work.
Cartels have power because prohibition does.

The work the miners do to create each coin, and the limited issuance of the coin. 
There's never going to be more than 21 million bitcoin. We know exactly how many bitcoin exist at any given time and where they all are. 
We have no idea how much USD exists and how much will be printed/created/destroyed in the future. But the total amount of fiat tends to always goes up. 
Purchasing power with fiat currency tends to go down as the money supply is inflated.
People sell for fiat because that's what people use to buy stuff and Bitcoin is a store of value. If you need to buy something from someone who doesn't take BTC then you need to swap. Otherwise it's proven to be a good store of value.
People still buy/sell gold for fiat, that doesn't make gold less useful for what it is.

My concern is that someday if/when BTC is worth an obscene amount of money the IRS is going to come knocking since I spent those coins and they are likely actively mixing back into the Bitcoin economy. They will want to know in theory where that money went.  
Maybe paranoia, but with complete visibility on where your purchased bitcoin went, Bitcoin may prove to be an ironically useful tool for tracking down tax evasion.

We're not against paying taxes, but expecting me to pay capital gains on top of any local taxes, for portions of portions of bitcoin spent is fucking ridiculous and a giant tax clusterfuck.

Put it all on a blockchain. A publicly verifiable open source blockchain project. Every government transaction will be tied to an end user and every person as money flows out will need to sign with their government issued private key. If money moves somewhere it shouldn't be moving to, you have a chain of signatures to investigate.
Even if it's still USD use a blockchain system to track all large transactions. Something the tax payers can follow and investigate.

Not to mention most of the tax money funds the education system in my state. I do wish I could smoke outside at a bar, or blaze up inside in a private club that sanctions it. I do also wish I had access to some of the amazing outdoor california cannabis I used to get.

Firstly, it proves it's worth as a store of value against hyper inflationary governments. Bitcoin losing 60% of it's value from all time highs is a cake walk compared to Venezeula's devaluation. 
Venezuelans can use BTC to guard their value and swap to local currency when they need to buy goods. 
How does it help Bitcoin?
More transactions. More HODLers. More testing and knowledge spreading in Venezuela.
Venezuelans are fleeing their country and taking the knowledge of Bitcoin with them. It's a tool for fighting bad monetary policy.

SR is a symptom of prohibition. 
The volume of business SR did pales in comparison to the "real world" trafficking. 
Drugs didn't start or stop trafficking after SR went down. They will continue to be produced because they're profitable.


Of course it doesn't. The black market needs to burn and go away. SR served to make a dangerous process a little safer for those choosing to engage. 


Yes it is. If we had legal markets, no bloody supply chain. You're blaming SR for adding a safer extension to a system that was bloody when SR showed up, and is still bloody afterwards. 
I'm not arguing that SR didn't fund dirty money cartels. It definitely did. Because that's where drugs come from in a system with prohibition. 
I'm saying they made a dirty process slightly cleaner and the blood you keep referencing is created by our bad drug policy.

It will mitigate corruption if properly applied. Imagine if every tax dollar was noted and stored on the blockchain. Private keys would be tightly controlled. All monies would have a known source and supply chain. Colored coins for the government. 
If some Bitcoin that the government provided ends up on an illegal site, like some pedofile site as an example. There is a chain of people who had to sign with their private key for those bits to end up there. Makes it easy to keep our government accountable if all of their money is tagged and labeled.
Not to mention they can't just print more money for any war they feel like pulling the United States into. 
Debt and money are the only pull the federal government has on the rest of the state. Why do you think our drinking age is 21? Because if the states didn't make it 21 the Fed was going to pull money for highways and roads. 
When you diminish the power of the state to control your debt and money you become more economically empowered. Both you as a person and your local governments.

We have had many bull markets. 3-4. Look at the BLX chart of all time price history. 
[Moonmath]( is a great example.  But there is too much momentum and everyone knows Bitcoin can go vertical at any time. ETF incoming. Bakkt. 
Any dump/dip down below 8k is going to be brief and reverse quickly. IMO. 
Golden cross is a big signal. But we've typically had a huge drop shortly after the bear market exit and the expansion we just had. 
But now more people are paying attention and want some Corn. :-) 
The fundamental analysis is what is important here. Especially with the current backdrop of economic troubles looming.
Nothing about this run is the same as it was the last 2-3 times except for the expansion which came much sooner than I thought it would.

The media consensus is he did.
The internet thinks it's plausible that either the corrupt agents manipulated some of the data, or there were multiple people on the DPR account controlling everything. 
The important thing is that he was never taken to trial for it, but it was still used to justify a life sentence for him. 
IMO he deserves a fresh trial because his trial was a joke. By his own admission he created Silk Road, the rest of the prosecution's case is super shady.

Bitcoin gets a bad rap because it's one of the only systems in the world that has real time data on it's energy expenditure.
How much energy do you think is consumed making/using/recycling holiday decorations on a global scale? We don't know. But it's worldwide and uses a lot of energy to put on. For a lot less value.  
Comparatively, Bitcoin is a drop in the bucket of our global energy use when you factor in external costs, water use, time, etc.

My advice was don't keep it on the trezor, but don't move it off the exchange until you (OP) comprehend how wallets work.
The OP stated in no clear terms that he is a noob. Keeping his coins on Coinbase for a week is unlikely to lose him his money. Even you can acknowledge that Coinbase **probably** won't go bankrupt and steal his coins in the next week.  I'd say there's less than a 0.01% chance of that happening this week. 
I'm agreeing with you, don't trust the exchange to keep your coins. I'm just saying, ".....but if you have no idea what you're doing learn how coin storage works first"
Leaving his coins on there extremely short term is not dangerous. I kept my coins on there for a year before I got a Trezor.

The MSM didn't predict it. It was one of Saxo Bank's "outrageous predictions".
Here is the PDF.


The Trump regime pulls out all the stops and jumps on a fiscal spending binge, further increasing the circa $20 trillion of US national debt and in the process, potentially tripling 
the current US budget deficit from approximately $600 billion to $1.2-1.8trn, or some 6-10% of the US’s current $18.6trn economy. 
This causes US growth and inflation to sky rocket, forcing the Federal Reserve to accelerate its hikes and the USD dollar to hit the moon. 
This creates a domino effect in emerging markets and China in particular, leading people globally to look for alternative forms of currencies and payment systems not tied to central 
banks that have exhausted monetary policies or crony governments that are in full financial repression mode nor transaction systems that are long overdue for a revolution. 
Cryptocurrencies are here to stay given the history of booms and busts in fiat money and debt excesses. Bitcoin as the face of cryptocurrencies benefits from this chaos. 
Emerging market powers eager to move away from being tied to the monetary policy of the US and the banking system as well as to adopt the block chain as a payment system 
prove willing adherents as they adjust to zero interest rates and the decrease in systematic risk.
If the banking system as well as sovereigns such as Russia and China move to accept Bitcoin as a partial alternative to the USD and the traditional banking and payment system, 
then we could see Bitcoin easily triple over the next year going from the current $700 level to +$2,100 as the block-chains decentralised system, an inability to dilute the finite 
supply of bitcoins as well as low to no transaction costs gains more traction and acceptance globally.

Assuming you're in the US. Sorry I don't have the news you want. 
Here are your options:
Trade in cash. highly risky and inconvenient, kind of illegal in the US for large amounts. Easy to get ripped off/robbed if proper steps aren't taken. 
Trade on regulated exchanges. Pay your taxes on short term gains. Just like the stock market.
Trade on shady unregulated exchanges (if there's any left). Risk them running off with your funds or locking up your funds due to new KYC rules. 
There's no tax on HODLing until you sell. If you keep your Bitcoin for a year or longer you pay far less in taxes. 
You pay 0% tax on the first $38,700 once your Bitcoin reaches one year in your possession. 
Otherwise, have fun paying short term capital gains. 
Keep in mind that all of the other options have the risk of losing FAR MORE money than you would lose just by paying your taxes.
Taxes suck. Most of us here hate paying them. 
So many of us don't. By HODLing.

I own a Casa and I'll say that it is pretty easy for even the most basic person to set up. The hardest part is forwarding ports. 
There's a lot of features missing from it that I know Casa will integrate in eventually. It's still early. 
But it is nice having a full all-in-one bitcoin node and LND node in one box. 
The new extension is pretty cool for making payments. But at this time it really only works if I'm at home. Look forward to them building this out so you can pay using your home node on the go. 
No RPC support yet for the full node, so I can't use my Casa for Samourai payment using my own node. 
There's a new update almost every week. So I see good things for Casa in the future.
The value of having the GUI is really excellent. If you're a command line warrior then you would be better off setting it up on your own and it would be cheaper. 
Before anyone asks, Casa did not give me a free unit because I'm a mod here and I'm not shilling them, I just wanted a consumer grade unit to try out and give feedback on.

If you blasted 10-20% into the sun, dropped them down the trench, or otherwise destroyed/removed them from the market, publicly. There would be a price boom short term or long term is up to the market, but that price would still go up with supply and demand laws as we know them.
With Bitcoin yes, Bitcoins get "destroyed" by sending them to burner addresses or lost forever by forgetting the keys. 
Events like this constrict the available circulating supply even more. 
What I think you're missing here is that Bitcoin is expandable. 1 Satoshi could in theory represent $1 USD.

If you create a new seed/delete all copies of your wallet then create a new wallet, yes your Bitcoin will be locked up forever, never to move again.
For example if you have a Bitcoin wallet that's not backed up on your phone and your phone dies tomorrow, your Bitcoin is never moving again. 
If you back it up and create a new wallet, you can restore it at any time.

The scaling wars have shown us that it's better to be efficient with blockspace rather than have lots of space that goes unused. 
~~BCH's blockchain is also going to see severe bloat over time. It's already 130 gigs despite only being 1.5 years old. Meanwhile Bitcoin is ~200 gigabytes while passing it's first decade.~~ Edit got my forking history wrong.
Being able to let every person run their own node with minimal bandwidth requirements is important for decentralization. 
To boot, having all that extra space is wasteful. Learning how to make the most out of each block is an important endeavor.

Against my better judgement I'm going to jump in here. 
I'll start out by saying that Ross definitely deserves some jail time. Under the laws of the jurisdiction he resided in, he broke some laws. He had chances to plea out he and they threw the book at him. 
Drug laws as they are written today are really silly, counter productive, and ultimately hurt communities more than they help. The drug laws and prohibition create the black market that allowed DPR to flourish. The same way Al Capone flourished during the prohibition. 
Darknet market trading has not stopped with his incarceration. It has only expanded and diversified. Granted that users and sellers need to be much more careful now. 
DPR ran a criminal organization of sorts. There is no denying that. Ross admitted to starting SR in court. There is no denying that. 
Using laws designed for a violent mafia boss on a young kid from the bay area is overkill to say the least. We're going to spend millions keeping him under lock and key for the rest of his life. It's an absolute waste of a life and taxpayer resources. 
That having been said. 


DPR (because I'm not convinced there was only one site leader) allegedly ordered hits on 4/5 people, after the agents involved (now in jail for being bad apples) setup a series of events that led to that hit being orchestrated. 
They did indeed find a diary detailing those hits on Ross's computer.
But playing devil's advocate:
Was the diary the only copy or was it downloaded from elsewhere? Was it accessed and modified before his arrest? Were more than one person sharing the DPR account and subsequent chat logs connected to it? 
We don't know. We probably never will know. Various parties connected to SR and unconnected to SR dispute that there was only one DPR. [Given that someone logged into his account](  while he was in jail. This could arguably be LEO's poking around and isn't proof that the real DPR is on a beach somewhere. 
I can't find the link at the moment but there was also a SR employee who had a codeword to verify with DPR that he was speaking with the real DPR (some basic opsec) and DPR failed at one point to verify that codeword (this was before Ross's arrest). 
This is all still circumstantial and obviously not grounds to spring him out of jail. 
From what we've gleaned from the court records, Ross's attorney and his mother there is a great deal of non-public information that was not allowed to be disseminated in court.   Including the testimony about DPR possibly being Mark Karpeles (lol?) being stricken from the record over the weekend. This says to me that the court wanted to quash any notion of there being another person under the DPR monniker, which is not really fair if you ask me. 
There is much that is still not public relating to Silk Road I'm guessing and we will never get the whole story. 
IIRC They have not accurately explained how they even found the SR server in the first place either. The accounts provided have been disputed.
One odd thing that really stands out to me however is the judge.
Katherine Forest. 
Per Wikipedia "Forrest was nominated by Obama to the bench in May 2011 on the recommendation of U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York."[who made Silk Road a public vendetta in 2011.]( 
Somehow she gets assigned the Silk Road case. Coincidence maybe. 


The Bitcoin community in general is very distrustful of governmental bodies. With good reason. There's a lot of libertarians here who saw Silk Road as a step towards progress in regards to making drug user safer in a climate that would not tolerate talk of legalizing or harm reduction. The judge dismissed the harm reduction aspects of Silk Road as well during sentencing. 
When Ross was arrested all we heard about was the murder for hire. It dominated every headline. It was the only thing anyone knew about the case. Internet drugs and murder for hire. Yet as has already been discussed these charges eventually went nowhere. IMO it was a smear job to taint the narrative and to paint Ross as a REALLY BAD DUDE. 
He might be a really bad dude. We don't know for certain, he certainly seems to have started the site with good intentions. 
His sentencing was pretty painful from outside observers too. He was treated as if he gunned down 30 people and was on trial for mass murder. 
They had no problem parading several unverified overdose victims and their families into the court room during sentencing. But from the libertarian standpoint choosing to do drugs come with risks, and SR did arguably provide the tools to be as safe as possible with them and subsidized them. 
Forrest is inherently wrong when she said "Silk Road brought drugs to communities that didn't have access to  them, in "staggering quantities." Drugs find their way to wherever there is demand, Silk Road ultimately just reduced the friction of demand and distribution by allowing buyers and seller to be more easily connected. No one was even at that point talking about pharma companies pumping opioids into every community in America. 
Drug users will find drugs if they truly want them. They're on every street corner in America, they're in every prison. Years later it's easier than ever to find fentanyl, heroin, and other drugs on the streets or online. 
Chapo has been sentenced but the feds are still seizing fentanyl and meth at the border. Someone else is running the cartel. 


Agree. Chapo actually killed people. Probably lots of other horrible stuff we will never hear of. DPR typed words on a screen, allegedly. 


Again, DPR did assuming no foul play or tampering. Not even Curtis Green the guy who DPR ordered a hit on actually thinks Ross did it last I checked. 
Do we have definitive proof that it was Ross sitting behind the keyboard typing those words? Not really.
If I logged into your reddit account and made online threats would that justify imprisoning you? Not really. 
In any event, I would have preferred to see Ross in jail for a few years and go on to use his talents elsewhere. He does not deserve to lose his life as so many others have to the tragedy that is the war on drugs. 
DPR put Bitcoin on the map and gave Bitcoin it's first marketplace usecase. He will forever have a place in Bitcoin history, for better or for worse. 
I hope this came across as intended not as a FREE ROSS NOW HES INNOCENT but as a "this entire thing was kind of shady/political that lacked a nuanced and fair sentence".

Monero arguably has the (edit: **perceived**) privacy game on lock. For now. 
That may change if/when someone figures out a cheap easy way to make Bitcoins fully fungible. Coinjoin/wasabi is a great start. 
Litecoin is a nice testbed for a lot of Bitcoin stuff. They played with Segwit first, and LTC seems to be working towards confidential transactions next. Which may or may lead to Bitcoin getting their own CT's (who knows?).
The trifecta of digital money as I see it is **speed**, **security**, and **privacy**. 
You could write books on each of those points. 
If Bitcoin achieves what we all hope it will with all three most alts become irrelevant. Bitcoin already has security, the industry standard. 
Speed of transactions is coming fast with Lightning. For large payments, waiting an hour still is much better than waiting for a wire transfer.
Privacy is the next big task in my mind. 
Now unless someone figures out a new aspect of cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin cannot be upgraded to fulfill (or doesn't need to) alts are going to fade IMO. 
Alts are a product seeking a purpose, and a market of people to buy their token. 
Very few of them add any value to the greater ecosystem in the context of understanding what Bitcoin's value proposition should be. 
Bcash has shown us the folly of big blocks. 
ETH has shown us the folly of having too many bells and whistles on a blockchain. 
90%+ of the alts at this point are dead or represent nothing but traders pumping and dumping. 
The point of all this is that any altcoin project is free to come for the king. But they have their work cut out for them. 
Not only does there need to be a value proposition to whatever  **could** replace Bitcoin but there needs to be a network of support that is lasting.
Most alts (not all) don't have real communities around them. Just hype so traders pump them and in turn sell them for more Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin's origin story is pretty unique and seems to be clean of baggage. Anything that comes after Bitcoin ultimately enriches the people who created the new contender.

Good question. 
If the entire sub has 7 active posts about the same subject with no notable difference in information that's just a little repetitive. 
As stories evolve they are told and retold and facts get twisted across threads too. Like playing telephone on Reddit. But that's not my point at all. 
Simply put, the sub doesn't need more than a few Quadrgida threads on the front page unless some truly new and pertinent information has been provided. 
The basics of this situation have already been aired out extensively. 
We try to use a light touch as much as we can but my comments here were only to make clear that the subject is not being "censored".

In a few different veins. 
Scaling: Making the fees cheaper and moving as many of Bitcoin's small transactions as possible off chain. There is a limited amount of blockspace (cyber wars have been fought over this). See Lightning Network and the scam Bcash (the coin that took a different scaling approach while trying to steal Bitcoin's name).
Merchant acceptance: Due to the massive fee event run up in 2017 many of the big merchants stopped taking it (eg steam). There have been some coming in now that the dust has cleared and Lightning network is starting to make gains. 
Consumer understanding: People don't understand the deeper meaning of Bitcoin. Deeply. They only see the media headlines and the price booms and busts, and not for the fundamental transformation in value transfer/sovereignty that it is. 
Security: There are always new exploits with hardware wallets (most of which are not realistically exploitable by the average consumer). 
You don't hear about the bad things during run ups. When everyone stops getting rich the critiques come.

There's nothing *wrong* with using a safe deposit box as long as you take some extra steps to prevent anyone from accessing your coins. Like encrypting the seed, or storing the other half of the seed elsewhere.

Yes but migrating 170k users without an outright subreddit ban is not likely to happen. It also provides an easy divisive wedge we don't need in our community. 
The bulk of people that care enough to migrate will move and herp derr in the subreddit(s), meanwhile new users will pour in here and we will all forget about the theymos issues when something else happens. The attention span for most internet users is not long. 
Theymos can look at this from a much longer timeline than us. From his perspective some rebel rousing happens every other week for him, if not daily. He still controls the subreddit and it's higher dialogue to an extent. 
He just keeps moving forward with whatever he's doing in the background. Collecting donations and bits.

Each of these areas have large time differences. So as the east coast is getting ready for bed Japan is waking up if my rough estimate is right..
Point is. Time zones.
Other factors go into it. But different locales wake up, read the charts, and make their plays based on the positions they took before bed on what the chart is doing at the time.

On one hand he's not wrong. The projects can co-exist. 
The problem the other tweets are bringing up are legitimate in my mind. Ethereum never masqueraded as Bitcoin. tricked users, used artificial pumps of this magnitude, etc.
If BCH is *truly* the superior coin then it will see organic natural adoption as they build its ecosystem.
What I'm seeing now is an attempt to grab the users in a rush for riches and worry about building the ecosystem later. 
If it (or Bitcoin) isn't the superior coin then the market has spoken. 
I wish their team well, but I don't see BCH being powerful for long unless they drastically change their tactics and their approach. I hope they decide to figure out how to co-exist instead of devolving into what we're seeing now. 
Call it Crypto Cash. Call it Roger Dollars. Call it whatever. 
Don't put lipstick on a pig, and say it's a better blockchain while building the foundation of your currency on lies and artificial pump and dumps. 
There are obviously issues to be addressed with fees and how bits get moved around. 
But with a 100 billion dollar market cap change needs to be slow and conservative. We've got a good ride going here, not financially, but what Bitcoin has taught all of us about banking and financial governance. 
We don't have to be enemies. Co-existing is possible. I agree with Andreas.

-Keyloggers/viruses for both desktops and mobile devices
-exploits for hardware wallets.
As bitcoin grows in value, the bounties for exploits will increase.
Bitcoin is solid, but access points that handle private data change things.
The masses are on average not great with technology and privacy. People are going to get hacked/phished. It is inevitable.

My personal opinion is that there is something that needs to be investigated with Tether, their issuance, and how they are backed.
Is it the complete reason for our recent bull run? No. But it probably does help.
The Tether issue can be solved quite easily. Let these exchanges have normal banking operations. Tether was created because of lack of banking services iirc.

1. Segwit2x cancelled. [It was always going to be cancelled according to some leaked emails \(assuming they are legit\).]( With the NYA agreement dead the big blockers migrate en masse to the next best thing, BCH. 
2. BCH spikes. hard. On zero fee volume mostly from Korea with Korean currency. Followed by FOMO traders trying to buy into what they think is the next bitcoin spiking it even more.
3. Massive social media campaign both on Reddit and Twitter, probably others. 
4. 100k+ unconfirmed transactions. Possibly another spam attack, but I haven't seen any confirmation of this so take it with a grain of rice. 
It does seem like a coordinated attack. This is just what I've observed in the last week. But I could very well be wrong.

I see great possibilities for LN and privacy. We're not there yet. But having a series of arbitrary hops all over the network and consolidating in a new channel and closing in a fresh Bitcoin wallet of your choosing could be a great privacy boon. 
I don't own or use Monero. But my understanding of their privacy approach is that it's still more effective than Bitcoin/LN. 
I was just saying at this time Monero is (at least perceived to be) the king of privacy crypto.
I don't think that title will be held onto forever. I obviously want to see Bitcoin become the fungible crypto currency it deserves to be.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��

The IRS would have a record of you purchasing coins assuming they win their court case against Coinbase which seems increasingly likely. 
If their value skyrockets someday they may come asking where they went.
They would see you sent coins from your account, to another account.
If your coins end up back on Coinbase at some point in the future or some other KYC exchange that may raise questions. Especially if their value is over 10k.
Just pay your taxes.

This is something has written up. 
In 2015 a debate gained steam about increasing transaction capacity. The "easiest" way was to increase the max block size by causing a hard fork of the network. A couple former developers abandoned the consensus process and turned to populist tactics instead through a series of blog posts. At the time, most users were unaware that hard forking will almost always result in multiple block chains (Ethereum Classic, Bcash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Clashic). The blog posts stirred up a lot of panic within portions of the community who were not so technically inclined, or refused to believe many prominent Bitcoin developers.
The two former developers deployed code which would trigger a hard fork for anyone running the BitcoinXT client. At the same time, instituted a policy against promoting clients which would cause a hard fork without broad consensus. This caused a substantial uproar. A number of users left for and began attacking this subreddit on a daily basis. Since then, has needed to employ rather strict moderation policies in order to keep the sub readable and free of disruptive players. There have been periods of over-moderation, but we have always tried to keep an even keel while also maintaining the subreddit's policies.
Eventually it was widely determined that BitcoinXT was a pretty horrible idea. But the debate had shifted from "how to increase transaction capacity" to "how to cause the network to hard fork regardless of consensus", which is exactly what this sub wanted to prevent. After all, Bitcoin is only as strong as the people who believe in it, all of whom agree about the network's consensus rules. Attempting the subvert those rules without broad agreement by network participants is viewed as a malicious act.
Over time, it didn't make any sense for those detractors to continue hanging around in Roger Ver acquired the sub and started promoting his website as alternative forums where promoting hard forks without consensus would be permitted. Roger used this subreddit's strict moderation policies as a marketing tactic by making broad accusations of censorship which continue to this day. Later came Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and btc1, all of which had very substandard developer teams and scoffed at any kind of peer review or technical criticism.
Each and every attempt to fork the Bitcoin network without broad consensus has been a miserable failure. Each attempt has seen more and more deceptive tactics by those trying to force the network to fork. And each attempt has also taught the community about how crucial broad consensus is, which is why many people appear so defensive against entities who try to fork the network without any technical necessity. The fact that Bitcoin is very difficult to change is a good thing.
Bitcoin developers were able to roughly double the max block size with the Segwit soft fork which activated a few months ago after almost a year of delays. Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and several other high profile people tried very hard to prevent Segwit from activating, which is ironic given that Segwit provides up to 2x increase in transaction capacity (the original foundation of this debate), as well as fixes various other protocol weaknesses, and also lays the groundwork for Layer 2 payment networks such as Lightening Network. Segwit adoption must continue to increase in order to see these effects. Users, wallets and companies need to evolve alongside the protocol, rather than trying to force changes to the protocol which only serve their particular business models.
On August 1st, Segwit became locked in and activated two weeks later. But Jihan and Roger decided to clone the Bitcoin block chain to a new altcoin they called "Bitcoin Cash". Naturally they've received heavy criticism due to misleading branding, and Roger has even gone so far as to publish articles claiming that "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin". This is why I personally refer to the altcoin as Bcash. It's less confusing for new users. Unfortunately this new altcoin has caused some instability in hashrate on the Bitcoin network since they did not change the PoW algorithm, and has also experienced substantial pump-and-dump behavior. We don't know how many people traded their Bitcoins for Bcash, but it appears there are a number of people who are financially invested in causing Bcash to surpass Bitcoin in hopes of taking the Bitcoin brand recognition for themselves.
When Segwit2x/btc1/B2X/NYA/Garzik failed to gain consensus a couple weeks ago, we all expected that the road would be clear to continue focusing on Bitcoin without distractions, but the opposite was true. We've seen paid astroturfing, compromised accounts and botnet voting like never before. Of course, given history of deceptive behavior, their most recent attempt to defame this subreddit's mods and a premier Bitcoin developer was to accuse us of carrying out an attack against this very subreddit, then blaming them for the attack. You know all that stuff about paid Russian trolls influencing social media? I was very skeptical myself, but it turns out the clickfarm attacking us was in Brazil.
Thankfully, most people saw through this propaganda, but many saw a wall of text and assumed it must be hard evidence of wrongdoing. So now we're being witch-hunted when we would rather be focusing on learning more about the protocol itself.
It's my position that since Bcash exists, Roger Ver and his followers have their own block chain, their own forums, their own website. Many of them have attacked this subreddit's moderation and userbase constantly for two years. They're no longer welcome to participate in this forum if they cannot do so in good faith. Bitcoin will continue to grow and evolve without them. I'm confident of that.
So yeah, I probably skipped about 98% of the drama, but hope that helps. Maybe I'll actually use this as a starting point for a wiki page. If you have any feedback or followup questions, shoot them over and I'll get back to you as time allows.

I work for a company that does a lot of billing and credit card processing. There's millions of users on our site weekly and we cannot manually approve and inspect every account for fraud. So we have to rely on an automatic system to flag most of it.
Getting fake billing info and credit cards is not hard for some. There are people all.over the Web whose sole journey in life is credit card fraud. Coin base has to deal with that fraud with an automated system. So the personal touch you're hoping for is impossible unless they move to China and hire a bunch of cheap labor.

Tax avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is not.

Most fiat is digital these days anyway. Why is USD a viable option if the SHTF?

Yeah but my point is that Gold has limitless values and uses to the world. It's not just a shiny brick. There are reasons it's worth cash. 
It has lots of industrial and medical uses for equipment and I'm sure it's necessary for some chemical reactions. I'm sure there's some gold on the ISS and in the hubble telescope. 
If not for gold and its special properties we might not be in the digital golden age.
I'm as big a bitcoin bug as they come but saying that gold has "no potential to improve the world" is downright incorrect.
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:44:06
I've been working with BTC for 4 years and I've never even heard of this wallet. you might've been scammed sir.

Not really. Loss of trust in the banks means people will search for other mediums to store their wealth watch what happens when the US sees negative interest rates. Gold, Silver, and Platinum are perking up. Bitcoin will go back up in the coming months/after the issuance rate cut.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:50:10
Get 250 oz of silver. 2 oz of gold. Store them away somewhere safe. 
Rest in Bitcoin. Maybe pay cash and get them anonymously.

Update: Chatted with their support.
Maruska B: Hello my name is Maruska, can you explain in detail how I can help you today?
You: Hi. 
You: Why don't you allow Bitcoin on your site?
You: Just curious.
Maruska B: Good evening
Maruska B: Thank you for remaining patient. I’m sorry the chat was a little delayed in starting.
Maruska B: I am just checking about this for you and will be with you as soon as possible.
You: It's okay, take your time.
You: Someone is posting on Reddit that you don't allow Bitcoin payments. Even though it's safer and more secure than a credit card.
You: So I wanted to know, why not and offer to provide more information to your company if you want it,.
Maruska B: I have checked for you and we do not allow the sale of Bit coins on the site, but if you have an item for sale on the site you can state on your ad that you would like to be paid with Bit coins, that would be fine.
You: Ok so then why was the guy's ad removed?
Maruska B: Which guys ad ?
Maruska B: An ad did not come up on the link you had provided me.
You: 
You: It's in the reddit link I provided.
Maruska B: From what I can see this ad is live on the site now and was removed earlier for this reason.
Maruska B: The ad can be edited now and it will be able to stay live on the site.
You: For what reason?
You: He was accepting bitcoin for payment, not selling bitcoin.
You: Sorry I'm not trying to be difficult.
Maruska B: Yes, and I am saying that it is allowed, and if his ad was removed as such it was done in error.

@_date: 2016-02-12 02:18:47
Why don't you ask ? 
I've used purse a few dozen times and never had an issue. 
Amazon is not Purse. when Purse says your account is under investigation it means that your Purse account is under investigation it literally has nothing to do with Amazon.
My guess is that there was something that flagged your account and they are looking into it. 
Was this your first time buying from them? Did you have previous transactions? Was it a high price item? Was it shipped internationally? 
The shopper likely won't see any penalties, but they won't be able to withdraw the held funds until the issue is resolved is my guess.

I wouldn't call it damage control. I'd call it providing the information we have. There are lots of newbies here who have no idea what's going on and it's better to provide some kind of summary of what we know so far. 
We have nothing to do with BFX or Tether.
[In other comments]( I've made it clear I'm personally keeping an open mind about Tether's situation and I'd like to see more audits/transparency from them. 
At the end of the day the fact that Tether exists is the fault of banking regulations.

She bought Bitcoins. She just invested. Get them into cold storage and forget about them for 5-10 years. 
That is the method that is the most likely method to make her money/preserve her purchasing capital.
Also, tell her not to buy things she doesn't understand in the future.

This is a problem of A. regulation of banks regarding "drug money" and B. customers not using bits to purchase. 
B could be solved by offering a discount A can be solved by a brave merchant processor standing up to the regulators.

Oh you're so fucked I bet. 
Escrow is where LBC holds the money until YOU verify that he sends the cash.
If you send him BTC directly, he can just run off with your money and not pay you. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:10:32
When the world is ready we will never have to trade for fiat. 
There's a limited issuance and it's faster and cheaper for international payments than wire transfers or Western Union. 
This is a revolution.
Getting in early is like buying a share of a public utility that's going to be around for a long time.
The price is rising because it's a good idea and BTC has proven to hold value for many people. Especially those in countries with bad monetary policy.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:00:18
Tether has been created in place of selling to USD for exchanges that can't get a banking arrangement. 
There's some disagreement floating around about how these are issued and the ability to cash out.

You're saying that anonymity implies bad information in a sub for a cryptocurrency that was founded by an anonymous person.
I'm not saying he's right, but there's some very wealthy people who would like to know who he is. He's right to be cautious.

That's what I'm saying.

Do you really want to cheap out on something that might potentially be holding a lot of money?
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:23:12
If that was true then people would never of had their accounts shutdown by coinbase.
@_date: 2016-02-12 03:16:53
If you dispute the charge amazon will never do business with you again.
It sounds like you need to be patient and ask Purse for more info, and a timeline.

A 32-year-old woman was found in captivity in São Paulo on Saturday (29), three days after being kidnapped in Florianópolis. One man, guarding the place, was arrested in the act.
The woman was surrendered on Wednesday (26) after leaving her daughter in school, in Lagoa da Conceição, for criminals who were in three cars. She was taken to Sao Paulo. On the trip, the hijackers sent a photo and audio as evidence to her husband.
Her husband is the owner of CoinBR , and a ransom has been asked for a millionaire value in Zcash and Monero, probably because they are coins with a greater degree of anonymity today.
The rescue
The contacts were all made via Facebook and WhatsApp calls to make it difficult to track calls. Still, the police were able to get enough information to locate the house where the victim was being held. Details of the methods used were not disclosed so as not to jeopardize the investigations that are still going on, but authorities have mentioned that both Facebook and WhatsApp collaborated a lot with the investigation. The victim was rescued and has no injuries.
In the house where the captivity was being made, a person was arrested. Investigations go on to locate the other suspects; it is estimated that 7 to 10 people are involved in the crime.
This is the first record in Brazil of a kidnapping case involving a cryptomaniac as payment for the ransom.

Well yeah. But that wouldn't affect your wallet/holdings. The distributed ledger running in the rest of the world would still be active and your coins would still be in place. 
People would find ways through the black out (and already are with darknet/meshnet plans). 
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:19:59
Same. They need to improve drastically.
@_date: 2017-04-08 04:12:58

the only place to get BTC now is coinbase LBC and paxful.

There are multiple mods with multiple view points. Keep in mind I'm only giving mine. 
But let's say we're in some strange bizzaro world where BCH's market cap passed Bitcoin one day. That is objectively huge news. It's contextual and relatable to Bitcoin as a whole. I wouldn't remove that story. Denying it happened would be ridiculous. 
My test for removal of altcoin stories is 1. Relation to Bitcoin/Grander ecosystem. 2. Is there substance to this or is it objectively spam/low quality. 3. Is there an argument that this is related to Bitcoin and topics Bitcoiners would care about?


I disagree. The core devs had a smarter scaling plan for Bitcoin IMO that was more elegant than simply raising the block size. Satoshi was not an all knowing god and he didn't think of everything. The block size debate was debated endlessly in this sub and eventually it turned into beating a dead horse. Bigger blocks were not the path forward as we now especially see. Discussion of scaling practices in good faith, I never banned people or removed comments for. But there were hundreds, probably thousands of trolls/sock accounts coming in and stating as an unequivocal fact that bigger blocks were the only rational way forward. There is a strong difference between discussion and blind shilling. 


My current thinking is that this fork mania purged a lot of the people from the Bitcoin ecosystem that did not fully understand the weight of what Bitcoin needs to be to survive. While remaining secure and decentralized. 
They were free to pursue their own projects and build out their own iteration of "Satoshi's Vision". 
The markets choose winners. Not the Core Devs, not the Mod team of If Bitcoin loses to BCH/BSV, it deserves to be beaten. But right now neither are close at all to doing so. 


No one is stopping debate about fees or the shortcomings of Lightning. Lightning is going to be great IMO but it's still a ways from being the full liquid network it needs to be. We'd be lying to ourselves right now if we didn't acknowledge that LN has some issues currently. Comparative to where we were a year ago as "vaporware" we are doing much better. 
I spend a lot of time in the "new" section and plenty of people come in with questions about scaling/fees/LN. They just don't get many upvotes often and make it to the front page but the comments usually get into answering their questions. 
I'm pretty happy with Bitcoin at the moment. # of transactions are pretty much at 2017 bull market levels, yet 1 sat/b transactions confirm in under 12 hours currently. Usually less. Sometimes more (thanks Veriblock). 


What good ideas? 
Building bitcoin is a process, a slow one. As it should be.

Personally. I don't remove contextual comments regarding Alts. 
If you're discussing Monero's economic theory comparative to Bitcoin. I'm not going to remove that comment. Or BSV's block propogation method contextualized with Bitcoin, I'm not going to remove it.
But if you're just saying Buy this bag, or shilling some random company's altcoin product that would be very off topic. 
There are some stories/comments that encompass the greater ecosystem. Bitcoin included. 
But consider the perspectives of moderating a million subscriber community. 
You don't see even a quarter of the spam comments and genuine shitcoin shilling. 
If your comment/post gets removed or filtered by automod feel free to drop us a message. 90% of the time we will push it through. 
That having been said. This is Not &gt;What I'm objecting to is the inconsistent application of the rules

Some stories are too big to ignore.

 Via Joshua Dratel.
I don't feel that the evidence they've released so far indicates Ross was the one who did it. Especially if the corrupt agents had access to the DPR/Mastermind account.  Ross is also smart enough to know that murder for hire would bring insane heat down on SR and it wouldn't be in his best interests. Further, I have trouble believing that he would write it down in a journal. Ross isn't the smartest guy, but he had to be "pretty smart" to even run Silk Road from a technical standpoint.
I don't know why you dwell on charges that haven't even been brought to trial yet or why the plausibility of a government smear job for a "drug kingpin" would not exist. Especially given the corruption.
We still don't know if DPR was the only DPR, it seems increasingly likely that he was not the only one using the DPR monniker. 
This and other things combined give more than enough reasonable doubt.

I fell for a Bitcoin doubler back in the early days and lost 3,800. 5 BTC at the time. 
Guy was professional. He earned that money. I'm not even sweating it today. 
It had not fully dawned on me that this small number of 5 was actually a huge amount of money represented on the screen.
It had also not fully dawned on me that there is no free money in life usually. 
I also did not realize how easy it was to simply run off with people's bitcoin after receiving them.
Worst Christmas Ever.
The hacker made off with 60k at the time according to blockchain.info. I know of one other person that fell for it lost 20k themselves. 
I sent a bunch of smaller test amounts and the guy kept sending them back with interest promptly. 
The wild west of Bitcoin was filled with scams and people were not as aware of them as they used to be. 
Never got the bits back, but learned a relatively cheap lesson in coin security and i've never done anything that dumb ever since.

Hacking notice
 
Hello, member, this is a bit coin exchange.
I am very sorry to inform you of the bad news.
 
On Saturday, April 22, 2017, a hacker attack between 02:00 and 03:00, four hot-wallets on the exchange
There has been a case of being hijacked.
The total damage amount is 3831 btc, which is about 5.5 billion won when converted into Hanhwa,
This is equivalent to 37.08% of the total assets of Yahoo! 'S holdings.
This is the situation that we have filed a complaint with the investigating agency.
After many discussions, legal and accounting consultations and reviews,
We have come to the conclusion that it should be applied fairly to all members.
It is also the most common way to go through the liquidation process.
The loss of 37.08% will have the same effect on all members' assets.
As for the KRW, BTC, ETH, LTC, and Fei of the members of the company, the deduction of 37.08% based on the balance held at 03:00 on April 22 immediately after the incident
. In the case of credit and 10x transactions, deductions are made against the final balance after the reversal has been made.
('Safe deposit box service' is just a 'system offering service' at the warehouse, just like a bank's 'safe deposit box'.
Because it is not an object under the management of the night poverty, it is excluded from 'deduction'.)
In this accounting asset re-balancing work, all deposit and withdrawal transactions and transactions between two or three days
The front is limited.
We are also concerned about how we can minimize the loss of these members.
Many discussions have been repeated. As a result, we come to two assumptions:
1. Member losses should be minimized and eventually zero.
2. In order to do so, companies and executives must maximize the loss of their members.
Based on these two great antagonisms, I deeply considered the methodology.
Management and directors, including the CEO, decided to abandon the property right to their company as much as possible to resolve the case, and decided to pay Fei, the company's beneficial interest, as free of loss for the members.
The details are described separately in the Q &amp; A below.
We apologize for any inconvenience to the smooth use of our members.
We will reopen the service within 2 ~ 3 days after finishing accounting work and strengthening security as soon as possible.
Q &amp; A
 
Q 1. How much damage do the members have?
A 1. Re-balancing assets of 37.08%, which is uniformly accounted for,
On an asset basis, a loss of 37.08% will occur first in your account.
Q 2. Is this loss not recoverable?
A 1. No. We are trying out all the measures to attract the loss of the members from the company and the management. We are going to pay the members 'Fei' sequentially by the defined process and reduce the loss of the priority members. The goal is to be.
Q 3. What is 'Fei'?
A 3. 'Fei' is a service product that has been issued by YafiZone and has been traded in YafiZone since 2014.
The content is 'I pay 1% of the commission income generated from Yahoo !, to the person who holds' 1% Fei 'every day.' Assuming that a member has 1% Fei and a daily transaction fee of 3 million Yuan, a bit coin equivalent to 30,000 won is called 'Jambu' It is distributed once a day.
Q 4. How much of the actual profit has been made to the members who already have 'Fei'?
A 4. 'Jambu' revenues for those who have one 'Fei' from January 1 to March 3 this year are 0.00177768 btc and 0.01493159 ltc. If you apply the quotation of Light Coin of 1,451,000 won and 17,000 respectively, it is 2831.6 won, which is equivalent to 12.44% annual rate considering the price of 'Fei' which is 91,000. 'Fei' was up to 170,000 won this year because of the high rate of return.
(The current price of 91,000 is also up more than 1,000% compared to the initial issue price of 8,900 won in July 2014, which shows the growth potential and growth rate of the virtual money industry.)
Q 5. Does 'Fei' pay immediately for the full amount of the damage?
A 5. In order for the 'Jambu', the profit of 'Fei', to be paid to the members, there must be a transaction fee income on the exchange.
If an emergency situation such as the IMF is triggered, a bank will be forced to withdraw assets from the bank, such as a bank that has many lenders lent to others, As the survival base becomes weaker, there will be problems in the payment of the long-term 'Jambu', which will not have a positive effect on the members, so sequential payments are made according to the plan.
Q 6. How will 'Fei' be paid?
A 6. The payment of 'Fei' will be converted to one per member's loss of 91,000 won, and the plan will be as follows. (We will take additional measures for losses of members who are under 91,000 won)
1. Fei will be paid to the members immediately for 10% of the loss of 37.08%.
2. After the resumption of the operation of the night pizzone,
Fei ', which is equivalent to 20% of the loss of 37.08%, is paid to the members whose average annual balance is reduced to within 10%.
3. After one month of resumption of operation,
Fei, which account for 20% of the loss for 37.08%, will be paid to third-party members who have decreased their average balance within 20%.
3. After three months of resumption of operation,
Fei ', which accounts for 20% of the loss of 37.08%, will be paid to the members whose average balance has been reduced to within 30%.
4. After six months of resumption of operation,
Fei ', which is equivalent to 30% of the loss for 37.08%, will be paid to those who have reduced their average balance within 50%.
For those who believe in Yahoo Japan and help normalize the exchange, the total amount of Fei for your damages will be paid within six months.
Q 7. Can night shift be normalized again?
A 7. Yes. There is precedent.
In the case of DAI, which is an investment fund, 3.6 million Indium was hacked,
The largest Bitcoin trading company in the world, known as Bitfinex in Hong Kong, was hacked in August 2016 and suffered 120,000 bits of coins (about 22 billion won), but its assets were down by about 36% After temporarily issuing coupons equivalent to the amount of the damage to the members, it becomes a bigger company now, and it is removing the loss by repurchasing the coupon to the members every month.
Q 8. How much profit do you have in the future?
A 7. In the first three months of this year, Yaizo generated about KRW 3.7 billion in profits and expects to generate revenue of around KRW 15 to 2 billion this year. If you trust me, I think you will be able to get rid of all your losses due to this incident in the longest time.
Q 9. What is the schedule for eliminating loss of members through repurchase of 'Fei'?
A 9. We will continue to repurchase 'Fei' with revenues from the exchange. We will first invest 200 million in May in the re-purchase of 'Fei' to reduce the loss of our members, and then we will continue to invest the proceeds from the company and announce the repurchase status of 'Fei' every month .
Q 10. Are there any additional growth potentials?
A 10. Artificial intelligence and virtual reality (VR) projects are growing rapidly all over the world
As a result, business related to virtual money is also growing rapidly.
At present, the company is in the forefront of new apps, including Ethernet trading, and the opening of a web-based trading platform that makes it easier for you to access the Internet.
In addition, we are expanding additional business areas such as Etherium and Monero, Zcash, which currently have a commission of 0%
We are investing in various fields such as proof of data integrity through blockchain chain technology.
We are doing our best to improve the growth of the company.
Q 11. Is there any personal information leaked?
A 11. All of your personal data such as your ID, login password, contact information, e-mail address, transaction password, and security card number are encrypted and stored separately.
There are no signs of leakage until now.
Q 12. Is there any possibility of another hack?
A 12. I can not assure you that there will be no 100% hacking in any field. However, we are in the midst of rebuilding all of our systems in the wake of this incident. In the future, we will be able to allocate assets connected to the Internet so that the company can cover all losses within 1-2 months of the company's operating profit We are building a system that can be operated in a minimized manner.
I am really sorry to have caused temporary or even economic loss to our members.
We will do our utmost to raise the company so that the loss of these members will be minimized and finally, the 'Fei' price will rise and profit will be returned to our members.
I am so much loved by all the members who have loved me so far, so I will be a puffer.
I'm sorry.

[Went looking to read up on this.](
"So far, Rico claims, the project has generated over 3,000 trillion private keys and checked them against existing bitcoin addresses to see if they work, and has found three that do and contain bitcoin. **They've found over 30 private keys in total, some of which are for so-called "puzzle" addresses that are suspected to have been generated as easy bait for crackers.** "
If bitcoin's encryption fails it can be upgraded and it would likely be a much easier thing to do than raising the block size.
" Castellucci also urged caution when it comes to getting all riled up about the LBC's search for a cryptographic collision in bitcoin.
"To effectively find [a collision], you would have to find some way to generate [keys] much, much faster than is currently known to be possible," he said. "Unless they find some sort of breakthrough in cracking techniques, the brute force strategy they're using poses no threat to anybody's bitcoin." "

Paxful stepped in to bridge the knowledge gap and help escorts learn to use it, and honestly it was really cool of them to do. 
In regards to waiting, most transactions at least show up on my mycellium wallet within a few seconds. They confirm later, but the transaction appearing would be good enough for most I think.

As long as we have VPN's, private torrent sites, and seedboxes piracy will continue to reign. 
Piracy is a symptom of a customer service issue.
People want to be able to download and access content without DRM for cheap.
In order to keep up with all of today's media, I need a netflix subscription, a amazon prime subscription, a TV subscription, HBO, and others. Over $100 a month. People have a free option to get anything on demand with no commercials. Why would they spend $100 or more to get their content? 
In reality it's worth about $20 a month. If I could get streaming content in HD for $20 a month from all channels I would pay for it and stop torrenting. 
Or even better, let me select ALL of the channels I want and be charged for each one individually instead of forcing people into package deals.

You need to find his keypairs. 
It's on a paper wallet, a wallet file, or stored on a hardware wallet. 
If he had any documents for his passing he hopefully mentioned them in there.
His estate should also get access to his email and search for "Bitcoin" in his emails and see if you can figure out if he used a popular exchange service.
His coins may be sitting on Coinbase for all you know. 
You need to go through his existing documents and emails and find out if he might have hidden some clues somewhere.
checking his computer for Bitcoin wallets as well would be wise. He might have stored them in a desktop wallet called Electrum. Run searches on his pc for "bitcoin" "wallet" "seed" and see if anything comes up.

I know these rules probably aren't your fault but the fault of the regulatory scrutiny you're under. You need to find capital to hire a larger more responsive customer support team, and you need to figure a way to make your ToS easier to follow.

Proof of Stake. Where the rich get richer, and people sell/stop staking if the price falls too much. 
It's interesting that it seems to you that PoS is the only effective solution yet it hasn't been implemented anywhere effectively from an economic standpoint. 


Agree. It will likely plateau someday in the future. But we're still a few decades from that time. 


At that point the fees for processing transaction around the network will ideally be large enough volume to sustain miners and motivate them to keep mining. If not, Bitcoin is a failure and it will faceplant. Seems unlikely to me. 
The 51% attack vector is incredibly difficult and unlikely. It is very expensive to maintain. It's also shooting your investment in the foot so unless there is a government who wants to burn a significant percentage of their GDP just to create some chaos I don't foresee it as a problem. 
 If Bitcoin gets to a point where it is the de-facto settlement instrument it will take exponentially more than $10 billion in hashing equipment to attack. There will be major companies globally hashing as they would now have a vested interest in assisting the Bitcoin network. 
As Bitcoin's price plateaus and the issuance slows down/goes to 0 the only way to get "fresh" bitcoin will be from mining fees. 
If people are settling multi billion dollar payments on the chain and paying the miners enough to cover their costs, the miners will keep mining. 
As far as I'm concerned PoS is a dead idea. Nice on paper to an extent, but PoW is superior and fairer.

Bitcoin has no main goal. It's just a ledger. It trustlessly moves tokens on a digital ledger between parties that don't trust each other. 


Bitcoin is deflationary. There will only ever be 21 million coins. A certain number are mined every 10 minutes. Every ~4 years the distribution amount halves (we call this the halvening). 


Limit orders on a professional exchange like Coinbase Pro or Gemini often have low/no fees. This is the best way to go about it. 


World governments are very differing in their positions on Bitcoin. Iran for example isn't a big fan. Venezuela's government isn't either, but their citizens are. The G5 countries are tolerating (and taxing) crypto earnings. The SEC is regulating some of the projects in the space. Merchants do accept it for payment, but the tax structure makes it harder to spend as a day-to-day currency currently. Calculating capital gains on every purchase of coffee is a PITA.


Right now? No. But Bitcoin is scaling up slowly. Other crypto currencies are mostly pump/dump scams that serve no real purpose. They would have issues scaling up to a large payment network without compromising decentralization. Check out the lightning network, segwit, schnorr signatures a bit technical, but you can find some great summaries. 


Here's a great book.

I'm very skeptical that this takes into account a lot of the external costs of mining gold. Assuming that money is a vehicle of stored labor/energy. 
- natural habitat destroyed
- moving all that earth
- processing the gold
- transport of the gold
- employment of all those involved
- cost of all the very large expensive equipment. 
- danger/risk factor
Many other things in this life use ridiculous amounts of power. Bitcoin is just far more predictable and open to scrutiny since we can see the global hash rate.
Bitcoin also allows us to use power sources in remote places that would otherwise go unused. Miners can move anywhere to maximize energy efficiency.

Right. That's called being agnostic. None of us know what's going to happen to Bitcoin and Crypto.
He called out specific scammy altcoins (EOS, Bitconnect).
He gave blockchain tech a lot of credit. Which does have some value.

Not Bitcoin. It would have to be it's own currency that's not relying on external transactions to confirm. Everything would have to be internal to your country in theory. 
You can't update a global ledger if your ledger can't update the balances from the rest of the world's transactions. 
So if you lived on a remote island with no access to the external internet, you wouldn't be able to use Bitcoin. 
Your miners wouldn't work. 
You wouldn't be able to send or receive. 
Bitcoin only works because it's global. 


Your copy of the blockchain would take some time to update, but your coins would still be in place.

Software wallets can easily be hacked or exploited if you download one wrong file. Or a key logger can get a password for your online wallets. Your coins can be sent elsewhere to a hacker. Most likely, it's not an issue if you're careful with your online browsing. If you're working with a small amount of coin it's not a priority.
Hardware wallets sign transactions offline and off your computer. So even if a computer was teeming with viruses it would be safe to use a hardware wallet on the computer. You have to manually confirm a transaction on the actual device to make it send. The circuitry intentionally only allows certain actions to be done and certain inputs. 
Trezors, Ledger Wallets, Keep keys are industry standard now for even the big players in Bitcoin. 
There was an event once where they passed around a ledger wallet with 50k or something on it. That's how confident they are with the security. Even if someone stole it they have a backup. Intruders also can't guess your password because the system will lock you out or erase your wallet. 
If you plan to own more than $1000 worth of BTC I suggest a hardware wallet.
Otherwise, Mycellium is my favorite mobile wallet.

No. He's in jail for other charges. He's never been convicted of hiring hitmen because the state does not have the evidence to prove it. 
The prosecutors knew he created Silk Road. That's all Ross ever admitted to. His continued level of involvement in SR is questionable. I'm of the opinion that there were multiple DPR's and he was the fall guy. But I will change my opinion if new evidence is presented otherwise. 
The government's own witness had to be silenced when they brought up the multiple DPR theory in court. 


I know he created Silk Road and had admin access when he was arrested. I don't know anything beyond that. 
Fun fact: Chuck Schumer made SR his personal vendetta and recommended the judge for the bench a few years earlier. He called in a favor. *tinfoil hat*
Any evidence presented that showed a chink in the prosecutions armor was shut down. Quickly. 


I'm sure the corrupt agents with admin access to SR and computer forensics specialties didn't tamper with it. Especially with what we now know about Ross's less than exemplary OPSEC.
Ross's case was a PR hit job. He was guilty before he was arrested. 
My absolute favorite part of the trial was when they paraded victims of drug overdoses out in front of the jury with no verification of the sourcing of their drugs or any personal responsibility for the victims. If you're going to shoot heroin, there's a risk of overdose. If I stab 10 people with a knife I bought on Amazon, does Jeff Bezos go to jail?
Ross isn't innocent. But nothing about his case was legit from the gathering of evidence, to the quashing of evidence, to the selection of the judge, to the sentencing. He does not deserve double life in prison without the possibility of parole. He was made an example of. The authenticity of those chat logs were never scrutinized and we may never know the truth. 
We know how dirty cops and feds can be in the US today especially for such a high profile case. I am generally distrustful of the government because they lied to us for decades about drugs (and still are). Ulbricht's trial is just another part of that.

Still missing the point. You're also assuming you're living in America and there isn't some kind of major currency crisis (ex. Venezuela). My point is that if your currency loses the grand majority of it's purchasing power in 100 years, in my mind, that's not good. 
I am aware that putting your money in the stock market would fight inflation. Duh. 
Forcing people into a casino style stock market where they have no sovereignty over their funds is not an ideal economy.
Removing the backing from currency as Nixon did only flung gas onto the fires of inflation. 


Bitcoin is less than a decade old and only been taken seriously for a few years. If even that.  It's a digital asset that deflates over time instead of inflating. None of us are sure how that will play out over the next 50 years but many of us here are obviously bullish.

I got a Bitseed for Xmas in 2014. Loved how simple it was to run a node as I didn't have a system to run a "Real" node on it at the time and wanted a low power option.
It worked. But required regular resets and it was troublesome to update compared to just downloaded the newest version of Core.
The device has bricked itself now and turns on, but no longer syncs. They seem to have stopped supporting it generally speaking. There hasn't been any updates to the UI in a long time.

How many times has this happened to Bitcoin? My point to you was to look at the bigger picture and you kept ignoring it. "zoom out" as they say. 


Bitcoin is scaling. Lightning network is getting closer to being ready for large scale off-chain instant payments. Other improvements to transaction capacity are coming. 
You're looking at numbers assuming they will stay static forever.

You're ignoring other scaling improvements.

* Steal card
* Spend it on something that can be sold
* Sell it for half the cost to make it sell faster
* Pocket the cash/wash it through services that give the frauder legitimate income. 
* Repeat 
This is what carders do with stolen card info all day long 24/7/365. Getting stolen money is relatively easy, but making it look clean is harder. Requires more steps.
There's multiple steps to the whole process but it's just meaningless ledger entries moving from one company to another until it eventually turns into cash that the frauders can withdraw.
It's money laundering in that a lot of carding operations can be tied to organized crime and it provides them with income that eventually gets cleaned. I'm making some assumptions here, but it's more common than you think.
It's credit card fraud on a micro level between a card holder and their card company.
But on a macro scale with hundreds or thousands of transactions it becomes money laundering when that money pools and ends up somewhere clean and un-tainted.
The tools and expertise to pull this off on a large scale don't come cheap and don't come without risk.

$300 is how much the casa node costs.
The parts for a RBP is ~$100-$175 depending on where you source the pieces. 
The other half of that cost comes from the GUI they've developed and the support they give their customers. 
Keep that in mind. 
The parts are cheap and it still requires some setup and knowhow to do. 
Casa and NODL are both $300-$400.
You simply have to decide how much work you're willing to do and time you're willing to burn to have a fully functioning lightning node.

You need to have some Bitcoin in a Bitcoin wallet that you control. 
You will need to buy some from an exchange. If you're in the US I suggest Square, Gemini, or Coinbase. Square particularly if you're using a small amount. 
You will withdraw to your own wallet. Samourai/Mycelium on Android or BRD/Mycelium on iOS and then pay on the merchant's website using your app.
It's a few steps to get setup and will probably take you an hour or so. But once you have all the moving parts together Bitcoin transactions are very easy.

You stored 10k on a hot wallet without doing any kind of research about a solid way to store it?
Blockchain probably isn't going to be able to help you. I'm sorry. But there are a dozen other solutions that would have been better than blockchain.info. 
Good luck.
Edit: in case my comment came off harsher than it sounded in my head when I typed it out,  blockchain.info has a really bad rap around here as a storage solution. We have seen it time and time again. It's not necessarily their fault but passwords and private keys get intercepted on such hot wallets.

If anyone is feeling overwhelmed by this and doesn't fully understand what it means I will simplify it a bit.
It's nice to have someone watching over your coins. ~~We were all~~  Most of us were raised in a way with banks keeping an eye on our capital and safe guarding/insuring it for us. That is no longer necessary with Bitcoin. If you have coins on an exchange and want to participate in the Proof of Keys event follow these steps: 
1. Download a good wallet. Samourai. Electrum.  Mycelium. Breadwallet. Bitcoin Core. Options across multiple platforms. Hardware wallets such as Trezor/Ledger are ideal.
2. Generate a wallet. Back up your private keys on paper or other medium that you feel secure with. Usually in the form of a 12-24 word seed. 
3. Withdraw your coins from any exchange to that wallet. 
4. Kick back and feel satisfied with a job well done. 
Congratulations. You now hold sovereignty over your coins as long as you keep your seed hidden.

Coinbase is just an access portal. 
Due to fraud risk (their stated reason) they make you wait a certain number of days before you can withdraw your Bitcoin to your own cold storage wallet. 
You're probably new to Bitcoin and don't know what that means.  
Your Bitcoin won't move off coinbase until you move them. 
They're not going to send Bitcoin or USD to your bank. 
I highly recommend looking into cold storage options for your safety once you are more comfortable with Bitcoin.

It's pretty simple. 
All LN channels are Bitcoin smart contracts. When both parties agree to open/close them they settle on the bitcoin network on chain
Lightning just organizes those smart contracts effectively and quickly to transfer value around. 
Lightning cannot exist without the underlying protocol of Bitcoin. While they are separate networks LN cannot exist without Bitcoin (unless someone builds it for another altcoin) 


 I assume you mean an on-chain transaction vs LN. 
LN payments usually settle in under 10 seconds. No clearing period it's just done. The fee is also a fraction of an on chain transaction. A fraction of a fraction of a penny.
Bitcoin on the other hand you have to wait for 10-60+ minutes depending on the network congestion.
Right now, network conditions are ideal. Fees are low. 1 sat/b confirms reasonably fast. 
Each method has their own advantages and limitations. Lightning is still very early. 
The general idea is moving all of the small "coffee" payments off chain so micro payments can settle up taking a large amount of traffic of the main chain while still relying on the main chain to settle all your payments ultimately.

You can make 100,000 transactions with a lightning network channel before you close it. You can do more. But it's effectively limitless as long as you have funds. 
The point is to move all of the small transactions off chain so they don't clog up the main Bitcoin mempool.
Every coffee purchase does not need to be on the Bitcoin blockchain.
There's only fees when you open the channel and close the channel. 
I lied slightly, you pay usually ~1 satoshi in routing fees between the lightning nodes as an incentive. 
Which is much cheaper than 1 sat/b.

Go check Veneuzeula's inflation rate. People can use various tools. But if people's two options are Bitcoin and the Bolivar, even with a 80% decline that's still a better store of value with the Bolivar's inflation. 


That's a strange habit if you don't live in a third world country. 


I mean for when you hand it to other people. Seems impractical. 


1 BTC = 1 BTC
You can keep quoting the 80% drop and ignore the gains from $0 over the last 10 years. Don't buy assets in the middle of irrational climbs. Same with gold or stocks. 


Yep. If a bank wants to freeze your assets, they can. If police want to extract a bribe out of you. They can. Bitcoin doesn't move without your private keys/permission. 


Because spending an ounce of gold is difficult when you can't get change back. The point is Bitcoin is easily divisible. Gold, you need flame, tools, and some basic know how. 


What are you talking about? The system of transferring value from A to B is trust-less. Merchant relations is a whole other ball game. 


You have been grossly misinformed. Bitcoin has been scaling. 


Less are printed every 4 years. Bitcoin's distribution period is temporary and more consistent than any central bank policy which can inject billions into an economy on a whim. Bitcoin's supply is increased slower and slower over time. 
On the other side of the coin we have a guaranteed 2-3% inflation every year (or more) with fiat currencies that compounds over time. 


This is not true and you know it. 


I'm familiar. Bitcoin is the first of it's kind. Previous iterations didn't have all the features and connectivity that Bitcoin does. All of the previous iterations had their own issues. 


You're really hung up on that 80% number and the volatility. Go read the book. Bitcoin crashed 80% and it's still 3x higher than it was in early 2017. 


I can use Bitcoin anywhere that takes a debit/credit card if I want to. I can buy phone credit. Amazon gift cards. Pre paid cards. Whatever. 


You can do whatever you want with your own money. "not using it" some would call this **saving**. Bitcoin encourages saving because it appreciates in value over long periods of time. HODL it or use it. The choice is yours. 


Go visit Venezuela and find out. They've been raiding buried bodies for gold teeth, empty super markets, people are fleeing the country en masse. It's easier to carry Bitcoin out of the country than gold, and easier to conceal. 
You've clearly read a lot of headlines about Bitcoin but haven't actually pondered the economic context. Again, suggest reading the book above.

Coinbase isn't Bitcoin. 
Coinbase is a centralized access point for acquiring Bitcoin (and more recently an array of shitcoins) that has to follow KYC/AML rules along with any regulations that come down from their partners/banking arrangements. 
Bitcoin itself does not need permission to move from A-B-C. 
Coinbase has it's uses as an access point for normal users, but if you deal in any kind of business that might trigger a flag it is likely to shutter your account. It's best to treat them as PayPal at this point. 
So now these organizations are seeing that they no longer can trust a centralized third party to process their transactions and have to go through some extra steps such as Bisq or find an exchange that is more tolerant of their activities. 
The problem isn't Bitcoin, the problem is Bitcoin interacting with an archaic legacy system that thrives on control. 
This system in the internet age has taken a keen liking to censoring people by shutting down their monetary portals. 
Regardless how you feel about Gab/Peterson/etc it may one day be you.
    First they came for the drug dealers, and I did not speak out—
         Because I was not a drug dealer.
    Then they came for the sex workers, and I did not speak out—
         Because I was not a sex worker.
    Then they came for the alt right, and I did not speak out—
         Because I was not a alt righter .
    Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
This pattern of increasing control will continue from the legacy market until either a breaking point is reached or a extraordinary leap in Bitcoin DEX options comes into play.

The community sentiment is that at some point a bitcoin will be worth $1000, or even $10,000. It might go up and down between that point, but it's generally agreed upon that it will happen at some point. 
With that in mind. People buy and hold their bits. Most of us are here until Bitcoin succeeds or fails. If it succeeds our coins will be rather valuable in the digital economy. Especially as more functions of day-to-day life get mixed with crypto functions.

So none of that has happened? 


Why? 
Arpaio violated a court order. He was profiling people based on race. That is highly illegal. 
Chelsea Manning wasn't pardoned, her sentence was commuted. That's not a pardon. 
Also Chelsea exposed crimes that Obama's NSA was committing. Crimes against your freedom and every american's freedom at the cost of her own liberty and freedom. That's patriotism. 
If your government was committing crimes and you expose them and face the music then that is true patriotism. 


You might want to read up on which party was in power when Iran-Contra went down. We literally sold cocaine to the inner city to fund the Contras, now we do the same thing but with Heroin. 
Cocaine dealers in any event shouldn't be serving life in prison unless they were murdering people too. He pardoned people serving stupid long sentences from an era when we were punishing people without thinking about the long term consequences of doing so. 18 year old kids shouldn't lose their lives for selling some blow.

I suspect that curtailing central banking would eliminate many of the core issues that Trump's platform set out to solve.
Trump is the big brother now. Don't forget that. He's owned. Someone owns him. Someone owns his debt. Someone owns his agenda. 
His AG just gave the police grenade launchers and tanks last week. Yet the right isn't calling police state.
Trump has done jack shit about central banks. Trump has not dismantled the NSA spying apparatus. Trump has not curtailed the wasteful war on drugs or the prison industrial complex.

Yet we don't care about inflation robbing us of our purchasing power, government bailouts, or major market corrections. 
Fiat is not stable. Its volatility is just hidden through various mechanisms and spread out over longer periods of time.
If you had 1 million USD sitting in cash in a bank account for the last 100 years a large portion of your purchasing power would be wiped out. Even with interest from the bank savings. 
That having been said, I think when G20 countries start hodling Bitcoin in their reserves along with their gold/oil/etc we may see some more stability comparative to fiat.

There's only 21 million bitcoin issued at an ever slowing rate. Currently only 12.5 BTC are issued by the network caused by miners doing hash functions every 10 minutes. 
In 4 years it will be 6.25 BTC. 
In 2140(ish) the last of the last BTC will be mined and the miners will run off the transaction fees the network provides. 
Currently over 75% of all Bitcoin have already been mined. 10-30% of them are burned/lost forever.

If you can connect to a node you can still make transactions.
That's part of why the satellite exists. 


No. The ledger is global and it needs to update. If it can't verify the rest of the transactions on the global network you're out of luck.
If you can get some kind of other signal out such as a SMS message to send a transaction your transaction can move forward.
If your country had it's own internal network and it's own currency that's only intended to be used inside that country...then you could use that currency.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. The Blockchain architecture is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the nuances will go over a typical users’s head. There’s also Satoshi’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The HODLers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these memes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Bitcoin’s existential catchphrase “HODL,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Satoshi Nakomoto’s genius unfolds itself on their news feeds. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, I DO have a Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid.

If the only thing you're looking at is the price, then yes. She's right. If you're looking at what's under the hood and what it can do, you will see other things. 


When the SEC/CFTC is meeting to discuss crypto this statement doesn't real hold value.
When people in countries with weak currencies hodl BTC they see their wealth get stored against currencies that buy less and less. 
When I can send money to my friends abroad with no friction and no gatekeepers for low fees, Bitcoin changes the world. 
Bitcoin has already changed the world drastically. New banking regulations have had to come to pass, companies have had to change policies, people are thinking about value and money differently, people are educating themselves on what exactly money is. 
7 years ago central bankers wouldn't even give Bitcoin a second thought and now it's got their attention. 


Did the car really change anything when it was 7 years old? The internet? The lightbulb? Technologies need time to spread, scale, and marinate in the public consciousness. 


A global recession requiring more quantitative easing from central banks thus devaluing fiat currencies even more. 


Faith is for chumps. Bitcoin is backed by guaranteed scarcity that can't be broken. It's counterfeit proof, consistent, and seizure resistant. 


Many here HODL because we see where this is going long term. The price is cool. It's not the primary motivation for us doing stuff. I would have made a lot of money if I sold at 19k and quit Bitcoin. But this tech is important on a greater level than personal wealth. Crypto at large is teaching an entire generation about markets, scams, patience, and long term outlook. 


Mainstream media doesn't like to cover how the global economy is built on a house of worthless fiat. They aren't tech savvy and neither is their audience for the most part. This is a capitalist society and people want to make money.

If there are literally no external connections to the outside world from the US (very hard to do and unlikely to happen) I don't think the blockchain would be able to be fully verified. Bitcoin is a distributed web and the propagation of transactions has to go global. People in the US would not be able to do transactions unless they had access to the global ledger.
If that ledger can't get updated from the rest of the world then the ledger becomes inaccurate and useless. 
When access was restored the blockchains and wallets in the US would need to update for a while and catch up with the rest of the world's transactions. 
What I think you're missing here is that if the US copies of the blockchain can't verify the rest of the transactions happening globally the ledger becomes inaccurate. 
This is of course assuming that the US government is able to shut down all external internet access with no exceptions. 
If there's a few people that are able to get their connections out somehow and they share their nodes with others things can still function. 
I may be wrong on a few points here but the bottom line is if your government cuts external access completely, Bitcoin could stop working. 
People would find a way however. 
If the US Government blocked everything they would have far bigger problems than bitcoin.

How much energy is used securing, transporting, providing the infrastructure of banking at large? Bank tellers, execs, all the people that have to commute to work every day, armored cars, water to make the paper/cotton that goes into the bills, destruction of bills, time money and energy managing the movement of that money. How much time and energy is spent on dealing with counterfeits and fraud? Etc etc.

So the 12 words you have are picked from a large amount of other dictionary words. It is impossibly hard to guess those words via a brute force attack.
It is now yours to secure and keep safe.
A few things to keep in mind:
* where is it stored?
* how many backups do you have? 
* How might you protect yourself in case someone finds your seed. Encrypting or splitting the words up are some high and low tech options. 
Those twelve words are now in your possession and the mechanisms that keep it away from prying eyes and online access are your new best friend. 
If the wrong person intercepts your raw 12 word seed, your BTC is gone. 
With that in mind, I suggest you start thinking of safe places you trust with something valuable and an acceptable backup system with your risk tolerances in mind. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:17:22
A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.
Bitcoin seems to fit that.

Pardoning people who were given sentences that were far too long. Selling cocaine on its own is not something you should be doing 20+ years for. Especially if you were a kid when you made that mistake.  Especially when our own government did it and no one went to jail. I hope you see the connection now. 
Arpaio was only facing a 6 month sentence. He was given a warning and he chose to ignore it. Something those dealers did not get the luxury of. 


Yes. That's one of the scandals I was not a fan of. But I doubt Obama personally signed off on it.

Congrats on making it out of rehab. 
Using Bitcoin for drugs is not as easy as it used to be. The chances of getting caught are much higher now. Especially for harder drugs. So if your sponsor is worried about you buying Darknet drugs just tell him it's not that easy anymore and the risk of getting caught is much higher.
Converting to USD or even a CD would only make it easier to spend with your local drug dealers. 
If you're really worried encrypt a word seed or buy a trezor and have your parents put it in a safe deposit box (make sure they mention that its yours in their will in case they should suddenly pass away) until you reach a certain period of time of sobriety.
IMO you should back up your keys, put them on a hardware wallet and back that shit up and forget about it. Even putting it in your own safe deposit box keeps it out of sight and out of mind.

The point is that in order to guard your personal wealth on a long term time frame BTC does it much better so far. Granted we only have ~9 years of data. But it has done that very well. It guards that invested value without having to trust a third party to safe guard it. 
I personally prefer the currency that buys more food over time than less. 


When the alternative is losing 17k every 10 years from your 100k yeah of course it is.

Speculation. Not worth the price of having Donald in office. He's an insane senile old man. I'm not a liberal cuck and I didn't vote for Hillary. But I'm not a single issue voter. 
I'm not against republicans being in office. The responsibility of power must be shared. If they're reasonable people who don't piss the entire world off day after day....great. Trump is unreasonable and we wake up every day wondering what he did next.
GW was a buffoon but he wasn't HATED WITH A PASSION.
Clinton got a blowjob in the whitehouse and probably did some other weird stuff, but he was a pleasant person to display to the world.
Appearances matter. Trump sucks at appearances, words, and accountability. Along with a few dozen other things needed in a president.

trump is either stupid, senile, or malicious. or all three. we will see where the cards fall when things move forward in the next year or three. 
Obama had a few scandals. I was not a fan of the Yemen bombing or the whistleblower stuff. But in fairness it was not week after week of this nonsense. The international community didn't hate us as much as they do now. 
Trump has already eclipsed Obama's scandals in a few months. Drained the SS budget, and spent more time on vacation than any other sitting president in the same amount of time. His conflicts of interests are astounding and we're heading for a constitutional crisis like we've never seen.
Pardoning Arpaio was the last straw for me. That man is pure evil and it was extreme executive overreach. 
Not to mention the sheer amount of lies he's been caught in.
Obama was at least good at lying. 
I really did give him a chance. I really tried. I hate Hillary, it should have been Bernie.

Coinbase still has very high fees for transferring. It's one of my biggest issues with using them at the moment. I usually wait until i have $500 or more before I transfer out to my cold storage.

My understanding is that the goal right now of the core devs is to make each block as efficient as possible so we can squeeze as much data into each and every block. 
Make those blocks carry more transactions and move small transactions off chain onto lightning. 
In the short term with the mass amount of people buying into Bitcoin and using it..... transaction fees skyrocketed last year. 
Since then transaction fees are lower than they were before due to batching of transactions by exchanges. That has been a huge boon.
Other changes are coming to cram more data into each block.
Eventually the block size may be increased, but only once it's absolutely necessary and after the existing blockspace has been maximized to include as many transactions as possible. 
Roger tries to paint it as a conspiracy to feed blockstream money and intentionally break the system to sell a product. 
Roger is fanatically tied to the original whitepaper that Satoshi put out and unwilling to entertain any new ideas. 
Satoshi gave us a great idea, and core built on top of it to improve it. 
But Satoshi's word is not law and changes had to come to preserve decentralization and scaling. 
If we stuck to original whitepapers in all things in life, we'd still be driving a bootstrapped model T and using iPhone 1 to entertain Ford and Job's original vision.

At the heart of it all is the most basic thought. The most basic instinct of a mother wishing to see her son doing okay.
This is where the story strikes home for me. If I was Ross or anything remotely as important as this and in trouble one of the biggest pains in my very being would to see my mother suffer. 
Ross probably didn't order those murders and was a striking visionary for the future of commerce and subverting stupid laws.

Sorry I'm on mobile I missed that. 


I get what you're saying here.  But loans don't increase the total supply. You're thinking of fiat.  
Fiat isn't needed to make Bitcoin work, but we would be fools to say that Bitcoin is going to be the only currency. Fiat may fail and something else may replace it. 
You would owe more and more btc if the interest accrued in btc. They may need to find an adjustable interest rate that changes with the price of btc. Mechanisms to prevent interest from getting too big may be needed.
Maybe also more scrutiny with who you loan money now that money can't be endlessly printed. 
It's up to people far more qualified than us but I think you're not looking at this right.

Before everyone jumps on the Alex Jones is an insane fear monger train...
Lyn is trying to spread word of her son's situation using all means at her disposal. Her story taps into deep anti-government sentiment and as such makes it ripe for Alex Jones ' audience. I am 100% fine with Ross's story reaching as many ears as possible to expose what appears to be corruption and stonewalling. Along with a corrupt DEA agent tainting the overall trial this is exactly the kind of *good* story that belongs on InfoWars.
I personally think Alex Jones is a crazy person that sells "feargear" via ads all over his website. But this story is bigger than him and quite frankly Lyn is using him for his platform which is fine. But at the same time I would suggest Lyn gets time on CNN for the same reasons. CNN is garbage but it is still a valuable platform if you have a message that needs to get out.

The same reason my Bitcoin cold storage hasn't been hacked.
Lightning is just a network of smart contracts connected to settled Bitcoin transactions. 
Now, I can't say without 100% certainty that there isn't some unknown glitch or bug that would allow someone to spoof their channel moving funds in their favor. I don't have the development credentials for that. But given the sheer volume of testing being done if such an exploit was out there it likely would have been found already due to the size of the bounty. 
Exchange hot wallets have massive honey pots, usually stored in one place, connected to a series of exploitable security mechanisms that exchanges have to use in order to withdraw from constantly. 
Exchange security is proprietary and not shared with the public. Lightning on the other hand is a distributed open source tested network which gives it a major advantage. Security through transparency instead of obscurity. 
In order for funds to move you have to sign transactions on your end just like a Bitcoin transaction. You're in control of your own funds and channel. 
LN is still obviously highly experimental but it's starting to take off and if you're concerned about keeping your funds in a hot wallet then don't until we've seen a long period of heavy use with no major issues.
If I got something wrong someone please add/correct me. :-)

Not nearly as childish as this bully government over reacting about a person who became rich off their prohibition policies. Also incredibly hypocritical of them since the government has been caught selling drugs repeatedly. Their foreign policies caused the recent rise in heroin use via Afghanistan. 
And they want to put the guy who made drug use and delivery safer into jail. 
Fuck that.

Especially when there are groups and entities actively running more volume and causing more death and destruction in the world. 
SR volume pales in comparison to the thousands of kilos of drugs that make it into our country yearly not to mention pounds of LSD that get broken down quickly into blotters. 
America loves drugs but if we continue allowing governments to dominate what spectrums of thought we have then we will never advance as a society.
Drugs are absolutely amazing. They taught me so much in my younger years and made me into a better person overall. 
Some people just eat them and party. Some people think and learn. Some people make money off them. 
They are here to stay and never going anywhere. This war can't be won and there's just a small cloister of people keeping them illegal. Law enforcement wants better options and the feds won't give in.

Anyone who has held bitcoin longer than 4 years at this point without selling is sitting in profit. 
Even 3 years it'd be hard to find someone who hasn't made money. 
Store of value means somewhere you can park your money for multiple years or decades and it either goes up or doesn't go down long term. 
If you're looking at short term price events then you're not looking at it right. 
 
It's not a loss until you sell, and this is a long game.
If someone is going to call store of value as bullshit with BTC then I ask "over what time period?"

Right. It takes almost no time for Bitcoin to show up as pending. 
Confirmations these days can a few minutes.
During our last bull run (pre-batching) fees were ugly. At the height of it all consolidating all of my coins would have cost $500 (HD wallet) to confirm in the next block. That's ludicrous obviously. The network responded accordingly and new scaling features are coming eventually.

You didn't answer the question. 
One of the main sources of fraud is carders and chargebacks. I deal with them every day in my line of work. 
Now if someone doesn't ship your goods then you should be using an escrow service or multi sig solution ideally. Bitcoin allows for that option.
But the point is that PayPal has people spending money, ditching accounts, changing IP's and doing it all over again. That's why this entire post exists. It costs money to deal with fraud.
With bitcoin a transaction is done and sent. You can't initiate a chargeback. There's no credit card company to call.

The other part of the equation is that reputation is king and the best wallets get the best reputations. Trezor for example is very popular and open source.

If you're here to "make money" it is my honest suggestion you leave.
Don't gamble with your life savings. If $100 is more than you can bare to lose then don't do it. Bitcoin goes up and down in value but it's true value is not the price.

Still unproven. No evidence was presented.

The burden is on the state to prove it, and they never did. 


If there was a smoking gun that proved without a doubt Ross was the person sitting behind the keyboard and ordered those hits I'd throw him under the bus in an instant. 
He was railroaded to send a message. He's not a mob boss but they treated him like one and quashed any evidence that painted a different story than the narrative provided by the prosecution.

Pure speculation but gold did very well during the last major recession Bitcoin may mirror it as an exit from the stock market. Bitcoin hasn't been battle tested against a recession yet. So we're not sure what the market will decide during that time. 


People are starting to flee the system that can cause those job losses and recession.  A recession means more quantitative easing which means devaluing a currency by printing a ton of money. 
Escape to the system where money can't be printed.
Bitcoin can't return to $1 a coin. It will fade into irrelevance long before it hits $1.
But that would require a lot of really bad events together to put the genie back in the bottle and I'm not sure it's going to happen. It would also mean a lot of investors, companies, and other interested parties would lose massive amounts of capital. 
I'm very confident in Bitcoin's future. Good things are coming. There will be more pain, but the struggle is worth it.

Firstly, being a drug user doesn't discredit the impact of your life. Otherwise you would have to discount all people you meet and all of the music on your computer that was made by people *on drugs*....
Secondly, he was the first one to create a successful darknet market. He created something never before seen in the world and he did it pretty well for the first time around. His OPSEC sucked, but Christopher Columbus was aiming for India, right? 
 He is being repressed and jailed by a government that is unwilling to examine their own policies and mistakes.

Bad news first. Your money is probably gone forever. Sorry. 
That's the legit Ledger site. 
You need to contact Ledger right now and tell them what happened. I would also move your anything else on the Ledger to another wallet and back it up immediately. 
You should also file a police report. Police are quickly catching up to the reality of digital theft.
If you're being 100% honest with us and you bought it from a legit reseller, and no one else has any access to your private keys/seed that wallet should not have been able to be emptied.
The Hamachi thing shouldn't of been an issue. I don't own a Ledger, but if it's anything like a Trezor it requires manual confirmation on the device to send your coins. 
So my only thought here is that someone intercepted your raw private keys somehow. Hardware wallets are *pretty good* at keeping your funds safe.

Agree. But gold can be used *as* money if you value it against the local currency you work in. 


Fiat currencies. Yes. They're good choices for investing because your choice is to lose 3% of your purchasing power yearly (USD) to inflation. 


How much energy does it take to transport, create, secure, insure, manage, etc USD and other fiat? I'm talking data centers, bank employees, bailout, fraud, counterfeiting. USD has plenty of "energy" costs that are spread out into other places. Bitcoin seems larger because you can see it all in one place. It's far more predictable.


They have plenty of intrinsic value. That's why people keep buying them and developing for the protocol. Just because you can't wrap your head around that value doesn't mean the value isn't there.
I would contend that you have some research to do. Because it sounds like you've been listening to Peter Schiff and Paul Krugman.

Depends where you live, what your needs are, and what your time horizon is. 
The "fees" of buying Bitcoin vary exchange to exchange. If you use a real exchange you're going to pay a fraction of a percent. If you're using an ATM or LBC you might be seeing higher fees. 
That "fee" also becomes irrelevant if the prices goes up.
Buying $50 worth of BTC on Coinbase costs 1.99 or so. If Bitcoin goes up ~3.98% that fee is wiped out in terms of purchasing power. 
If you use Coinbase's exchange, GDAX you will pay considerably less in fees. 
Bitcoin is seizure resistant and cannot be frozen as long as you control your own keys. PayPal for example will close your account or freeze your funds if they flag your account. This is not ideal as a merchant especially. 
If you live in a country where your currency is regularly devalued, has negative interest rates, or otherwise confiscated (Greece, Venezuela, Japan) Bitcoin has been invaluable.

So let me get this straight You view fanatical devotion to consumer privacy as personal issues? Because I view that as a damn good selling point for using their wallet. 
From your own link.


Bitpay has certain investors and leadership that stand juxtapose to privacy in Bitcoin.
Samourai's devs have made it clear that when it comes to privacy they will not compromise. 
If privacy isn't your priority then use a different wallet.
Don't call it "personal issues". 
Call it radical adherence to their core values. 
The issue here is Bitpay, not Samourai.

Making the wallet once it's done being:
* Designed

* Supported
* Upgraded
* Marketed
An iPhone is just a hunk of $600 metal at cost if it wasn't for the support behind it and the coding that goes into it. 
Same for Trezor. The cost of producing one unit does not equate to the fair price when you factor in all of the work that goes into it from the human side of things.

Why does the price of gold matter if mattered in USD? 
Part of this is a hedge against inflation. If your money is trapped in cash it will lose 2-3% annually to inflation. 
If it's in stocks you risk a down market and most people aim to get 7-10% gains per year. 
Bitcoin has value as a store of...value. USD may or may not exist in 50 years. Bitcoin and gold probably still will. In the interim you can change it to whatever currency you need to materialize goods and services in your life.

I'm not a pure socialist by any means. I think there are some ideas that can be frankensteined into capitalism. But I lean more towards free markets.
Distribution and collection of funds on a public ledger has some appeal because being able to track how those funds are being spent and where is one of the big fears of a large socialist government. 
If anyone can watch the flow of funds and spot a government spending funds incorrectly, or Basic Income funds being given to dead people (just an example) it provides a level of oversight for programs such as that. 
Real time transparency is something that *could* help socialism become a more tolerable idea, but it still involves taxing you heavily which is unacceptable to many.

1. Invest. Mining will take you weeks to get setup and you may not even break even unless your electricity is DIRT cheap. 
2. Bitcoin goes up and down. It may go back down to $1800 next week. Or it may go up to $2800. Only buy Bitcoin if you're willing to hold it for more than a year. Look at the long term price chart and you will see that anyone that bought in November 2013 lost money between 2014 and 2016 but now are sitting at more than 100% profit. Long term, Bitcoin is very likely to go up. 
3. If you fancy yourself smart enough to day trade (chances are, you are not) go check out poloniex. you can trade alt coins 24/7 there.

No one deserves to be in jail for drug trafficking in a non-violent capacity. Especially when the CIA did it (and probably still does), the ATF provided cartels with weapons, and no one at HSBC went to jail for laundering drug money.

I predicted this would happen. Darknet users will circumvent USPS and have representatives of different organizations legal or otherwise to do geocache drops for drugs/legal items . You request a drop within a certain geographical area. Within 24 hours you get coordinates and a photo of the drop site with instructions.
Cops cant stop it unless they find the delivery people by luck. As long as they keep rotating their delivery spots the cops will never catch them. As long as the users keep good OPSEC and encrypt their messages I don't see any way that the police will ever be able to intercept anything. No more fear of USPS love letters.
The issue of course is international deliveries or remote areas where people won't be available to do this kind of thing. But maybe that's where drones and other methods come into play.

So ask yourself. 
You have a bozo heroin user in front of you. You don't want to lock them up. They're going to keep using no matter what you think about them. No matter what laws you put in place. No matter how much you spend on police and jails. 
We've wasted billions globally on the drug war.
What if it was cheaper and less painful to all parties involved to allow the drug use, legalize it, allow it to be done indoors in safe spaces, with controlled doses and clean access.
Do you think that the harms associated with it would go up or down?
In this particular case...we're seeing decriminalization. Not legalization. So the cartels moving product still own the market. They control the drugs and the flow of product. The portugese government doesn't get tax money from the sales.
Imagine if they did though. Imagine if every heroin sale was taxed at 100% and each user had clean access and needles. 
Yeah. They're making dumb choices with their life. That's their choice to make. But when they fuck up and overdose no one is scared to call the cops to save them, and they will have access to rehab at no charge.

Legalize and regulate.
People have access to clean heroin. Places to shoot up safely. With clean needles. 
Tax the heroin. It can fund rehab. Since it's legal, the heroin will be much cheaper and people won't go broke paying for it. 
The cartels won't be able to sell it to people anymore so their power and income will decrease. Their membership will shrink. 
I'll see if I can find some studies for you tonight after work.

You're probably not going to catch them. Proxies, VPNS, and cash exchanges means these guys just made off with a fortune.
Contact your local police too. They may have a digital crimes division and can get in touch with the exchanges to blacklist the funds. I'm honestly not sure. But 100 BTC is enough that they're going to investigate seriously.

Ross isn't innocent. But do you think he deserves a double life sentence for running a website? Nah. I don't. Give him 10 years and community service. Put him to work. he has talents that shouldn't go to waste. 


The original legend of DPR is a title that's passed among people to carry on a mission. DPR did several interviews and talked with many people and the type style and persona of the person speaking in those interviews changed over time drastically. His character and methods changed. One of the site admins had a method for verifying with a previously agreed upon word which DPR was not able to verify at one point. The feds were also looking at Mark Karpeles as a possible DPR suspect. But the moment that their witness said that, it was stricken from the record. 


The illegal steps taken to locate the Silk Road server. But the reality is we don't know. Only the feds and maybe Ross's lawyer know what the feds haven't told the world yet. 


They were removed from the transcripts. But there's plenty of chatter about them. Go read the news stories from the days surrounding it. Go watch Deep Web by Alex Winters they went over it I believe. 


I think that there is a strong chance the DPR that was running the show at the time of Ross's arrest is on an island in Fiji. Just a gut feeling.
I don't think his involvement was limited to one line of code, but my feeling is that the US gov wouldn't care if it was. They wanted someone to go down for cutting in on their action.

I used to until my state shut down access to the exchanges. 
It's a great way to earn money if you're comfy trusting your coins to the exchange. It may not seem like much in earnings, but the annual interest rate is pretty good. Sometimes you get insanely good interest rates that makes it almost seem too good to be true. 
Consider also that if the price doubles those fractions of a Bitcoin add up quickly to a serious profit. If the price goes down then you get a little extra cushioning for your losses. 
I suggest using Poloniex lending bot with it. 
It's not really worth doing unless you have 10+ BTC IMO unless the interest rates happen to be good.
Make sure you declare it as income. Because it is.

I have probably read more about the trial than you have. If there was anything that actually tied him to the murders for hire I'd be calling to lock ross up and throw away the key.
The murders for hire were just a publicity stunt to put him away for life without actually trying him for them.

No, I'm saying that he likely wasn't involved in the murder for hire that was setup by corrupt agents.
The moment the evidence says otherwise I'll throw him under the bus. But the trial stunk to high hell.
Further he still hasn't been tried for the murders. The charges were just laid to wreck his credibility and it's proven an effective tool. People believe what you tell them.

Not to start a random thread or anything about CC but why are you a skeptic?
Scenario A: Global warming is fake. We keep polluting our oceans and killing of species worldwide with environmental damage and just choose that we don't need to worry about carbon or other gas emissions. Businesses prosper and continue making money endlessly.
Scenario B: Global warming is real and we buy the human race time to get off this planet and colonize other worlds. In the mean time we boost our economy with new efficient technologies and research. We get cleaner air, water, and more preserved natural environments, and hopefully slow down this temperature rise we've seen in the past years. 
Scenario C: Global warming is false but we invest in it and get all the best technology and innovation we get out of Option B. 
Choosing to act like CC is a possibility seems far sillier than assuming that we're not starting to have an affect on the world climate especially when we get all the benefits of new clean technology and jobs creating them. 
Will CC cause some businesses to fail? Yes. But horse carriages had to go too at some point when the car came along. We won't be around to even worry about those companies IF CC turns out to be true. 
I'd rather hedge my bets on CC being true and not trashing the environment. It's not that hard once the right tech is made, it's just a matter of subsidizing it and getting it into the public.

There is a semi-safe way to do it.
The only risk is the exchange being hacked. Which becomes less likely as time goes on as the exchanges get better at protecting themselves.
Poloniex and Bitfinex offer margin funding lending. You give traders liquidity for margin funding. 
You get a percentage per day of the interest. If you have enough coin in there you can get a few bucks a day. Some days the interest rates are ridiculously high and you can earn $20 a day, sometimes they are low and you earn almost nothing. But you can keep stacking bits.
I was doing it for close to a year until recently when my state shut down the exchanges.

She also knows the trial inside and out. 
Acknowledge the bias on both sides. Compile the information available from both sides.
Form a conclusion.
Don't just listen to one side of the debate.
Lyn has her bias but she's very honest about the points where she had bias. We all know what she wants. She wants her son out of jail. That makes her bias very easy to see.

Bitcoin and crypto at large allows for a far more transparent and fair issuance of money. Not sure if it's 100% the next financial system to replace fiat yet. But it's arguably better than a centralized censorship control structure that slowly eliminates your wealth over time. 
Bad actors in a market will always seek to corrupt any assets to acquire more for themselves. But the issuance and distribution of Bitcoin and arguably some other cryptos is much fairer than fiat currencies. This does help to even the playing field.
I trust Bitcoin because I don't have to trust Bitcoin. I know how much exists today tomorrow and 10 years from now. 
The issuance of fiat is at the whim of governments and central banks. I think that consistency in BTC is very appealing.

Bitcoin is valuable because it's a token of value exchange that will definitely become less available as time goes on. It's value comes from it's planned scarcity over time and the available coins in the market at this current time.
Combined with the cryptographic proofs showing that there are only certain amounts of coins in the Bitcoin system we know exactly how much exists and is moving at any time of day.

Newegg would know what you bought. Their merchant processor could probably find out if they needed to. Not sure if Newegg would pass the detailed invoice to Bitpay or whomever. 
The NSA/FBI/DEA could subpoena them at any time for the shipping address if you used an address connected to a darknet market for example to pay.
Coinbase also has your ID.
If your coins go to an address connected to a flagged wallet that violates Coinbase TOS and it's enough money coinbase might tip off the feds.

If you convert it to a Traditional IRA it is tax deferred. So you don't pay taxes on it until you withdraw (but keep track of your buy price). 
If you put it in as a ROTH you pay taxes now, but no taxes on withdrawal.

They might use facebook or social media, even though none of that is real.

No. 
You pay taxes when you put it in. 
When you withdraw it you pay no taxes on the withdrawals. 
You're thinking of a traditional IRA. 
If you make 1000% in gains on a ROTH IRA and wait until the appropriate age to withdraw you can pull that money out with no taxes on it.

Firstly, this is not a make money guaranteed type of thing.
Bitcoin could fail tomorrow. Unlikely. But it seems to be solidifying it's place in the world. 
There are no dividends from Bitcoin. The closest thing were the hard forks that happened in 2017 but the most profitable of those (BCH and BTG) have come and gone and the rest have not been as profitable.
Buying Bitcoin in some ways is like buying a bar of gold. It sits wherever you store your private keys for it until you're ready to use it. 
So the possibilities? Being realistic, it could be worth one million in 50 years, or it could be worth zero.
You can buy and sell Bitcoin very quickly 24/7/365 once you are setup on an exchange. Many people just buy and hold.

No one wise leaves large amounts of coins in their purse wallet. If they do they're either in the process of making a purchase or haven't found a buyer for their item yet. 
This hack went as smoothly as could be for the users and purse was fast to act. 
It will take a month or three for a full investigation to be posted like bitstamp. 
There have to be mechanisms of trust or better trust less systems. If you're not using 2fa for your hot wallets then you deserve to be robbed as far as I am concerned. If I ever have more than $100 wrapped up I always do. 
I applaud purses' fast action and security here. Hacks happen. It all depends on the response from the company.

Someone asked him to login to look at something. Doesn't mean he was still the main and active administrator of Silk Road. 
This also fits the narrative they provided that he sold off Silk Road in the early days. 
He definitely shouldn't of logged in. But I find it hard to believe that he kept logs on his personal computer of ordering hitmen to take out Curtis Green. That is an OPSEC failure of monumental proportions.

I smoke weed. That's all. It's legal where I live. I've tried everything under the sun when I was younger, but those days are behind me for the most part.
 Just because I'm anti-drug war doesn't make me a junkie. You use drugs every day. Alcohol. Aspirin. Tobacco. Sugar. Etc. 
The drug war is my area of study for school and it's my largest passion.
It destroys lives. Ruins families. Bankrupts the state paying for enforcement.
I am very pro drugs. Because drugs are awesome. They teach us so much about the earth, our chemistry, and our reality. They help heal us from PTSD and depression. Combat addiction (ibogaine) and even aid with alcoholism. I can provide you links to information if you want them.

I think Ross created Silk Road. That's what he admitted to. He sold it off early on to the DPR who I think got away. Whoever that is.
I think he consulted and helped and different junctures and was eventually made into the fall guy. 
I am alleging that either Ross wasn't the one who made the hits  (multiple DPR theory) or that the corrupt agents tampered with the transcripts. 
Both are plausible. 
What do I think the government did? They hid information from the jury and the world about the corrupt agents. The judge herself did a complete 180 about relevant testimony over a weekend when it came to the multiple DPR theory.
There is still a lot that hasn't been released and not all of the Silk Road staff has been captured last I checked.
The government didn't care if ross only wrote one line of code or was the full master mind. They needed someone to go down so they could show the world that they will fuck up your world if you continue to try to fuck with their profitable drug scheme known as the American Drug War.

They're buying it anyway even though it is illegal. It's better to acknowledge that they will do this. It's normal human behavior and has been since the dawn of time.
It's better to do harm reduction and mitigate the harms than to lock them up and burn money punishing them. Keeping drugs illegal empowers the cartels and the prison system. 


Legalize, and you can give the drug dealers jobs producing, packaging, distributing, regulating, marketing, etc that industry. Legalizing Cannabis here in Washington has produced thousands of jobs directly and indirectly in the industry. 


Not all drugs deteriorate your health. Drugs affect different people in different ways. But I promise that the dirty drugs that people are getting off the street are far worse than what we could be giving them in a controlled regulated setting. They're going to go seek the drugs anyway. If they can't find them...they go find...bad things. Ever heard of [Krokodil]( 
Krokodil exists because opiates are expensive and hard to come by. It's dirt cheap. But it will destroy your body. It will literally cause your limbs to rot off your body. If opiates were cheaper and readily available...people wouldn't use this crap. There are other bad drug variants out there that are similar with horrible affects that addicts use when they can't find their normal stash.
So that is why I support regulated control of heroin and other hard drugs. Because if people have access to the good shit, they don't go looking for the low quality crap.
Let me put this another way.
If I can go buy Patron at the market, I'm not going to go to the unregulated moonshiner with shady untested spirits. 


Kids can get heroin easier today than they can beer or pot in my state. If you regulate it, the black market supply dries up because there is no demand for it. This means there's less unregulated sources selling to kids. People who buy heroin would have to show ID and can't take more than a certain amount with them. Selling to minors would carry stiff punishments and even jail time. 
Speaking of jail time, 
our prisons would be empty. clearing out all the low level drug dealers leaves police resources free to work on REAL CRIMES like murder and arson. It also frees up prison resources along with court resources to reduce wait times and judicial backlog. 


there are plenty of things in life that are addictive and legal that we all have to deal with as human beings. plenty of people are shitty people without drugs. McDonalds and diet coke were engineered in a lab to trigger dopamine sensors in our head the same way drugs do. That's why McDonalds and Coca Cola are multi billion dollar drug pushers disguised as food.
some people are addicted to sex and will contract a fatal std.
some people are sugar fiends and will die of clogged arteries. 
some people are adrenaline junkies and will basejump into building.
addictions are part of life and you have to just accept that. we all make dumb choices as humans. every single one of us.
let people be addicted to what they want to be, but let's fund the resources and exposure needed to let everyone know "hey there's help out there and you can have it for free any time you want." 


One pill of oxycontin costs about $2 whole sale (from a quick google search). Industrial grade heroin/morphine is dirt cheap. It is so cheap. It's also pure so a little goes a long way. 
Heroin is ONLY expensive because of the prohibition on it making it illegal (and expensive to import).


Addiction sucks. But people are going to be addicted. see my above notes. Just gotta be there to help them when they decide they're ready for change. Many heroin addicts are ready to quit. But doing so is expensive and you need help from someone while you detox. Taxing the drugs would be easily done.

Most likely they put the bulk of their coins in some kind of time locked environment that requires certain amounts of time to pass before keys can move. 
The private keys to move tens of millions of dollars don't move quickly. This is probably required as a condition of their insurance. Same can be true for large banks. Coinbase is a bank.
Think like a time locked safe for bits of data or for all we know their private keys are held in underground vaults in multiple parts of the country.

Well it's kind of like digital gold you can keep in your pocket and send anywhere. The price fluctuates like gold, but because everything is digital is can go up and down with a little more regularity. What makes it like gold is that there is a limited amount of coins that will ever be created (21 million) and many a few million of those 21 million are lost/seized/stolen already. Gold is valuable because there's demand and it's seen to retain value. People have that same trust in Bitcoin.
It's both B2C and C2C because both companies and consumers can use this to pay for goods, or companies can use it to move their funds around with verifiable proofs that the transaction was done. If I refund a customer I can point to a transaction on the blockchain and tell them it was done and prove it was done. If I'm a company and I need to send money to a contractor overseas, I can send a bitcoin transaction and it will cost pennies and take an hour or two instead of days and losing 25% in the process, or paying wire fees. 
In regards to stability, we're still in the unknown. Most people think the price is going to go up as the coins become harder and more expensive to mine. The "halvening" is also coming in the next year and the issuance rate of bitcoin will drop from 25 every 10 minutes to 12.5 per ten minutes. 70% of all coins that will EVER exist have been mined this week and 90% of them will be mined by the 2030's. Bitcoin is an experiment and unless some of the underlying tech issues (see: blocksize debate) it could easily fail and go to zero. On the other hand there's millions invested from some big names in tech into the Blockchain technology and bitcoin at large. If bitcoin failed it would be like an sector of the economy going belly up. I'm optimitic (as are many others) that this will not happen. 
The cost of creating a bitcoin changes over time. The "difficulty" of the neverending bitcoin equation that the mining network is trying to solve gets harder. ( the difficulty gets higher as more miners connect and work on solving the hashes that the network generates. I'd ask a miner, but I think it costs around $180-$200 to create each coin depending on your mining setup and electricity costs. I'm not an expert in that field. 
In regards to the consumer base development we've had VC's generate over 600 million (source:  and more to come. Some weeks we see another 50 million raised. We see banks and companies looking into the blockchain separately or Bitcoin as a whole. Various companies large and small accept it. Of course, you can also buy drugs with it. 
There are people holding (or hodling as the saying goes) and some people spend. I feel that some people do a bit of both like I do. I spend a few bits a week, but a save anything I can in my long term storage. People have used bitcoin to buy and sell homes, tesla cars, normal cars, and other properties. I'd look through "top posts" through the years and see what pops up. But people feel just as safe taking Bitcoin as they do taking cash, if not safer. Long term most people think it's going to yield a boon for them and it's safer than cash if you take the proper security precautions. 
Frauds, that's a longgggggg answer. Especially after the 2013 boom we saw a variety of companies come out of the woodworks trying to get people to send them bitcoin. I'm sure you can google a lot of them under "bitcoin fraud" or "bitcoin scam". Some of them are services promising to double your coins, others were cloud mining firms, and others were alt coins, which were simple pump and dump bitcoin clones trying to cash in on the optimism from the $1200 per coin Bitcoin run of 2013. To prevent fraud a lot of companies have come up with their own private methods of preventing it. I'd ask Coinbase, Purse, or Bitstamp to see what they do but I doubt they will tell you. Most of these companies build relationships with you and only let you do a certain amount of business with them until your prove you're a good spender and play by the rules.
Bitcoin is both fraud proof and fraud friendly. No one can steal your coins unless they have your private key. But once the coins are gone....they're gone. There's no take backsies. There's no chargebacks. For merchants it's a great deal, for customers it can be difficult. 
In regards to the liquidity, there's only going to be 21 million ever created. That's your liquidity. I think we're at 14 million or so right now and more created every ten minutes. The general community belief is that when the coins stop flowing heavily like they are now, the price will rise. But that is all speculation.Bitcoin is an experiment.
It's worth noting that the Silk Road bitcoin auction is coming up and the 44,000 coins are going to sell for a few million dollars. There will be bidders paying above market price for them and if there was no belief in bitcoin, no one would be buying them. 
The short answer is no one knows what is going to happen over the next 50 years. But we're all in the ride to the moon and we're optimistic for the most part. 
I hope this answers some of your questions. Welcome to Bitcoin. 
I invite others to critique this reply, I'm sure there's examples I've missed and things I didn't explain fully. I banged this entire summary out while I was at work and rushed :p

I majored in drug war policy. I'm aware where the drugs come from.
Soft drugs don't have any negative impact. (Weed and psychedelics) 
Harder drugs that have to come from outside of the country cause the symptoms you speak of. But again. Not the fault of the darknets. 
The cartels cause the violence and the solution is to legalize. Until then the supply chain will continue and people will continue buying drugs. 
Hold your government accountable for their actions. Not the darknets trying to work within the reality of a situation.

I don't really consider the $1200 ATH that relevant. It was caused by external circumstances and an ecosystem that had not fully developed. Specifically gox and their delayed withdrawals, combined with uninformed "investors" buying in on the this "get rich quick scheme."

You can't wire money to anyone with relative anonymity the way you can with Bitcoin. If somehow theoretically one were in possession of an ISIS payment address and you sent money to this address, there's nothing that could be done to stop you.

Offline wallets are pretty simple. It's a password and a username in some ways.
The private key and the wallet address. 
If you generate those offline then there's a very very very very *very* small risk of someone intercepting your private key.
Once the private key is generated offline you save it somewhere (safe deposit box, bury it in the ground, lawyer/estate manager) and forget about it.
Without that private key, your coins don't move.

In the context of the full statement it makes more sense.
"As detailed below, the attempted “murder for hire” allegations should not be considered
because (1) they were not charged conduct, and were not encompassed within the jury’s verdict
in any respect; (2) they do not constitute elements of Counts One, Three, or any of the other
counts in the Indictment; and (3) as the Stipulation embodied in Government Exhibit 805
establishes beyond dispute, there is no evidence – despite the government’s comprehensive
investigation – that anyone was murdered or even harmed in relation to any of the alleged
“murder for hire” plots – indeed, all of the evidence, and lack of evidence, establish that the
persons purportedly targeted, as well as any related activity, were fictitious and the alleged plots
were not manifested in any manner, but were limited to cyberspace discussions.9
In that context – cyberspace – there was abundant evidence at trial establishing that the
Silk Road web site (and the internet as a whole) contains ample components of masquerade,
code, disguise, deception, and role-playing. That lack of transparency with respect to meaning,
intent, and even identity deprives those discussions, included within Government Exhibit 936, of
any firm meaning, much less that sufficient to justify enhancement of a defendant’s sentence."
It's a fair point given the full context. They aren't saying that this is roleplay, just that there is roleplay and other things on the site.

The war on drugs is an abject failure that dominates humans. Often times the drugs don't do as much as prohibition.
It's become clear that the government and police work in tandem to put people in jail, extract money from them, and remove their liberties over some biological concotions. 
We are literally saying "you can't do these drugs because...we don't know why...but pay us foo."
Even if you only get caught with an ounce of weed in some states that's still going to go on your record, bankrupt you, and ruin your life.
God forbid if you decide to try some cocaine or smoke some opium.
Not all drug users are addicts the same way that not all alcohol lovers are alcoholics.
Legalize. Regulate. Tax. 
-Drug Cartels/Gangs would die out in America because their primary money maker is now legal.
-Jobs would be created packaging, regulating, transporting, marketing, and distributing the drugs safely. 
-Overdoses would go down due to proper safety labeling, consistent doses, and purity of product. 
-Police expenditures would be cut in half.
-Court would be free to work on REAL crimes instead of bothering with tracking drug users and dealers. 
-Society as a whole would advance their emotional understanding of each other through some of these drugs. 
I see a world where the gangbangers would drop out of Cartels, they would be offered amnesty to come produce drugs and use their knowledge. 
I see a world where the CIA cannot sell cocaine to fund black ops like they have done in the past.
I see a world where licensed establishments will be created to provide safe enviroments to use drugs of all types.  
We cannot win the war on drugs, but we can mitigate it and recognize that drugs are part of our world, our evolution, and our development.

There's only 21 million coins. We've identified a lot of accounts that are burn accounts, stolen, lost, or seized coins. I know there are groups trying to track coins that are lost/burned. The price is based on what people are willing to pay vs. what they are willing to sell for. 
At some point in the coming 10 years the number of coins being held onto, not used, or lost are going to outpace the demand for coins to use for normal transactions. That's when the price rises.

Also Agora Evo and other markets have continued functioning. Anonymity is an art and they are the professionals. 
"Those sources do very bad things to protect their enterprises"
While these stories are rare, they do happen. They can be prevented by legalizing. 
Darknet markets are a symptom of a problem, not a solution. 
Dark markets reduce violence from people having to go to sketchy places to get drugs, no more dangerous cuts (if researched properly) and significantly less risk when ordering personal amounts. 
Drugs don't cause death. Ignorance of drugs cause death.

Bitcoin allows complete publicity with transactions and complete anonymity when the right steps are taken. 
Governments can use it to track expenditures with public verification. Imagine if every salary, expense, and transaction with the government was public record that could be confirmed at any time. If money goes somewhere and the people don't recognize it or condone it.......

If you have to ask this question you bought Bitcoin without even an inkling of understanding how it works.
Not a big deal. Lots of people do that. That's why we're here to help.
The dumbed down version is that as time goes on, bitcoin will become harder to mine and create. The cost of producing each coin increased over and time there is a hard limit of 21 million coins. 
Assuming that more people begin using Bitcoin, that means more demand on the 21 million coins. There's way more than 21 million people on earth, so if that demand is stretched far enough the price will rise.
Will it go down? Yes. It always does, but long term it will go up.
It's like an index fund for the internet.

He's not correct. They improperly brought it up at the trial briefly. despite him never being charged for it.
He was never charged with the hitmen for hire. 
He was never found guilty.
If he's guilty then how come they never took him to trial for the hitmen for hire?

This question gets asked a lot and I give the same answer each time.
Bitcoin has never been around and popular during a major financial global recession. 
We don't know what will happen. People may flock to bitcoin for capital preservation. Or they may sell their bitcoin to offset their losses in other areas. 
What we do know is that Bitcoin has proven to be a good hedge against financial problems in India, Japan, Venezuela, and other countries. These are minor economic issues in the grand scheme of the world.
I think it's a solid bet. But we don't have any data on a global recession event.

Multiple people involved with the Silk Road cited a change in writing style and attitude at various points in the Silk Road.

Okay. That's a fair reason. 
So in a world where heroin is legal..
-it's cheap. no more stealing from your friends to pay for your habit.
-you can afford rehab, because taxing it can fund rehab clinics for anyone that use it. there are plenty of heroin users today who know how to use it properly without becoming a drain of resources.
-injection clinics give a chance for doctors/medical professionals to evaluate and check in on users for mental health/iv illnesses. 
Right now. The way we treat heroin. You're 100% right. You become a strain. You become a problem. 
What I'm asking you to do, is to envision a world where we treat heroin like a SICKNESS and TREAT PEOPLE like they're sick if they need it. 
Locking them up and throwing away the key doesn't do shit. 
Keeping their drugs from them doesn't do anything. They just go buy it from the streets and get dirty drugs. Or worse, they go buy fentanyl.
If we can provide people with clean heroin, give them rehab at no cost to tax payers, leave the responsible users alone, and get the junkies off the street, would that kind of solution interest you? 
Dude I'm not a heroin fan. But I studied drug policy in college. This is my major interest.
When we change the way we handle drugs, we will change our entire world.

Yeah slavery. We should have just let that remain law. That's what you're saying. 
Bad laws get changed with civil disobedience. 
Drugs don't kill people nearly as often as ignorance and drug laws. 
See Al Capone. He was in favor of prohibition, they made him filthy rich.
The cartels love prohibition. It means their drugs are worth 5000% more than they are actually worth.
Instead of blindly following laws you should ask why a law exists in the first place.

You realize that the fortune he amassed was more from the price of bitcoin fluctuating and not his own greed? He never anticipated it getting as big as it did. 
Read up on ross, he had hackers and other OPSEC related costs to pay. The operation he was running was expensive and the funds were needed.
He took a percentage of each transaction. The same way EVERYONE IN EVERY INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD DOES.
That's not greed. That's just capitalism.

Brian thanks for coming.
How much money has Coinbase spent lobbying policy makers to change the requirements for this? We're all anti terrorism and anti-meth dealers for the most part. But the laws are ridiculous and were likely designed in the aftermath of 9/11. 
If the rules don't change Coinbase is only ever going to be an access point and merchant processor.
I like using your services. I really do. I feel safe using your vault and comfortable with your security and insurance. Moreso than I am with my own skills in the matter given the state of the tech.
Your users hate the rules and regulation. We're not opposed to you knowing who we are. But what I spend my money on is my business. Any coins that leave my coinbase wallet I tend to tumble unless it's for something I don't care about.

Don't use a "wallet site". 
If you're planning to have $1000 or more in BTC, get a Trezor, or Ledger hardware wallet. 
NONE of the reputable sites are going to skip on KYC. That's why they are reputable. Because the government keeps an eye on them so they can't run off with your money. 
You can also just download a mycellium wallet or breadwallet and use them for your payments.

That having been said, there are massive improvements Coinbase needs to make. But they're not a "scam" company. 
They make their money at times and that's fine. But I get what I pay for and the access they provide has made me a tidy profit over the years.

Text for non subscribers:
On Jan. 26, a New York Stock Exchange-backed startup, Coinbase, launched the United States' first regulated bitcoin exchange. The new exchange lends credibility to the cryptocurrency, which has lost about 60 percent of its value since the beginning of last June amid fraud, hacking and theft cases that plagued the currency's stability.
The exchange's launch is noteworthy, but so is the distinction between bitcoin's value and its regulatory and business acceptance. Though bitcoin might fail should its users lose faith in it, the concept of cryptocurrencies is here to stay. The endorsement of these digital currencies by financial regulators and merchants is a move toward the broader recognition and legitimacy of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, once favored by those who wanted a currency unregulated by any government. 
Cryptocurrencies can be thought of as a technology with the power to have far-reaching effects on the global economy. In some ways the individual bitcoin is similar to gold in that it is hard-wired to appreciate in value. However, unlike gold or any other currency, it can be divided almost endlessly into small parts. Bitcoin was among the first cryptocurrencies to gain serious interest and backing, largely due to the efforts of Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for the person or group responsible for the "bitcoin protocol." Prior to bitcoin, electronic currencies required a third party, such as PayPal, to determine if one party still owned the money or had previously spent it, thus transferring ownership to someone else. The bitcoin protocol solved this problem by creating a publicly viewable global ledger, known as the "blockchain," that shows the sequential transactions of all accounts using the cryptocurrency.
Bitcoins are bought and sold online and are generally stored in a digital wallet. The currency is not controlled by a central bank but is instead managed by an online community. Members with powerful computers are encouraged to maintain the transactional register by "verifying the blockchain" — solving complex mathematical equations and adding another block of transactions to the existing chain. This process is known as mining, because the verifier is rewarded with new bitcoins. New bitcoins will not be created after there are 21 million in circulation, which is projected to happen in 2140.
Cryptocurrencies are still far from becoming a powerful financial tool. Yet, cryptocurrencies and the overarching bitcoin protocol will remain in some shape and fashion. The movement on the regulatory front is an important precedent that is being set for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen if these currencies can grow out of their niche market, but much like the Internet or file sharing, governments cannot exercise complete control. The United States and United Kingdom appear to recognize this fact and are trying to do as much as possible to bring bitcoin and other similar currencies into the traditional financial market.

The point is that people know drugs are bad for them. It's up to them to let them make those harmful choices for themselves. 
Educate them. Give them the tools to do those drugs as safely as possible. Clean needles. Clean condoms. Clean snorting tubes. Clean crack pipes. Whatever. 
Give them warning labels and dosage instructions and standardized pure dosages.
I guarantee you will see overdoses fall and more people enter rehab if they have access to it for free.
Regular heroin/opium use isn't going to kill you by itself. He's right. If you know something I don't please let me know. But heroin and opium doesn't kill byitself.

You generate a 12-24 word seed when you set it up. 
It's up to you to back it up safely. If that means writing on paper and putting it in a safe deposit box, or engraving it on steel plate (see cryptosteel) and burying it in the yard...that's up to you.
If anyone ever got access to that 12-24 word seed your money is gone. So guard it carefully and put it away.
If you fuck your trezor up you restore it using the 12-24 word seed and a new trezor.

All of the evidence that would have been favorable to Ross's defense was shut down without cause.
When one of the government's own witnesses even alluded to the fact that DPR might have been someone else the Judge at first allowed it and then over the weekend struck it from the record.
They wouldn't even allow Andreas to testify, so the jury had no idea what bitcoin was or how it worked.

[PSA: Mycelium scammed the community out of 5131 BTC](
They refuse to address it, acknowledge it, or at least apologize. AFAIK. 
While Mycellium's simple GUI and place in Bitcoin history will always hold a special place in my heart this kind of back hand to the people that use your product and gave you fundraising isn't acceptable. I don't use it anymore, I don't suggest using it to other people anymore unless there's no other option for that person.
They can choose to begin to repair their reputation but have not done so for some reason. 
Some people don't care, but some of us have been around long enough to know that long term integrity matters.
I'd like to see a long "Here's what happened to the money" post from Mycellium's official channels and what, if anything, their investors can expect in the future. Because the silence is fairly loud.

Coinbase is for Bitcoiners. I disagree with the sentiment that it's not.
Coinbase is stupid simple to use once you have an established account. I use them as an access point. I don't gamble or make darknet purchases. So I haven't been shut down yet. 
So far I haven't run afoul of their policies, but I've also proven myself a good customer. But I know that won't stop them from shutting me down if they find a reason. 
At the end of the day, I buy coins and transfer them to cold storage immediately. I don't trust Coinbase to not freeze my funds someday for some reason or another.
The problems we hear about are not coinbase's full fault. It's a desire on their end to not run afoul of the KYC laws. If they fuck up, they are gone and done and they can't provide Bitcoin to anyone. 
I'd like to see them improve their customer support network because they need to have more active support like Vanguard of Fidelity.
I'd also like them to be more upfront about the main reasons for account termination. Most users don't realize they can get their accounts shut down for buying weed on the darknet or gambling online. 
It needs to be in clear lettering at the top of their TOS or on another page.
If you're a legit person who's not doing the things we know are against the law, Coinbase is fine.
If you have good banking credentials and credit and that makes you stay in their good graces, fine. 
They look at each account and look for risk indicators. I'm sure they track your public social media to the greatest extent they can.
I'm grateful for the easy access to Bitcoin and 3 years of consistency. I buy little bits and average up over time and each time the system works. I buy and the coins show up in under 10 seconds most of the time, I send them to my Trezor and that's done. 
Coinbase is an access point that is highly scrutinized. They are facing endless fraud from the net and hawklike regulators just waiting to bust them for a screwup.
I'm not a shill for them, just a satisfied customer. We see the end results of account shutdowns and get mad, but forget that some people have bad banks, bad credit, or are attached to some illegitimate behavior on their social media. It's about evaluating risk and maintaining government satisfaction. That's reality, they have to work under the system we're trying to overhaul with BTC. 
If you don't like them, go buy your coins somewhere else. You're either going to have to give ID, be limited in your buy amounts, or pay a premium for coins without KYC. 
Coinbase provides consistent access. That is their core product right now.

You would simply need to declare your Bitcoin earnings as income if you want to be legit. 
Being a findom or even a cam-model isn't illegal and as long as you don't meet with him for sex/etc there's no legal issues. 
You simply need to be an indie contractor is my understanding. 
 has more info I believe. 
Just keep meticulous records of your earnings and their value at the time of receipt. 
I assume you're over 18. As long as you are not a dependent of theirs you can do your own taxes and their own tax rate won't go up.
If you're unable to support yourself without using the "dirty" money then you may want to just keep it in Bitcoin.
Talk to a tax person who can help. You need to be independent or be honest with your parents about your new income source.
Being paid in Bitcoin doesn't mean it's tax free. It's still income. But if you try to save that money and it ends up being worth something someday, you may need to identify it's source unless you plan to spend it like cash. But you won't be able to use it for a house or other major life investments. 
Sorry for the convoluted answer, but Bitcoin is not tax proof without some steps and they aren't fully legal in most places.

The moment that the encryption/math nerds of the world encounter a SHA256 "collision" bitcoin would likely upgrade promptly IMO.
It's something very easy to see a problem with and changing the encryption algorithm *should* be easy. This should not be a contentious issue like the block size debate as it wouldn't change any of Bitcoin's other architecture. 
I am curious if it would brick existing ASIC's.

Let me explain to you why credit cards payments work the way they do and have limits. I work in payments dealing with credit cards on a popular site. 
-It's very easy to spoof the information attached to the card with a VPN or proxy. Users with stolen cards can make the system think they are legit by having their connection appear from the home state of the user. 
-Chargebacks. People can run up a large bill and then simply do a chargeback with the company involved. Especially if it's a stolen card. They're not going to contact Coinbase first, they're going to dispute the charges immediately and get their money back ASAP. 
-Limits are in place to limit the potential losses from carders. That's why Coinbase makes you verify to an extent (part of it is KYC) to have an identity attached to the card in case you are shady. Fake ID's are getting harder and harder to make and there is tech that can detect fakes from images already. This means the best way to increase limits is with TIME. 
Start buying $40 worth of Bits daily. It won't kill you set a daily buy if you want.
Your limit should rise quickly. 
In short. When you are starting out with these companies you will have limits, especially when using CC's. As you build a relationship with them and they make a profit on you via the fees they increase the limit over time. Most carders want to hit hard and get out as quickly as possible and repeat. 
If you want a higher limit with Coinbase, verify and allow more time for their anti-fraud system to get to know you.
I've been using them for 3 years and have a 10,000 daily limit and $3000 instantly weekly limit. 
I didn't even ask for a limit increase at any point. I'm just a trusted user at this point.

Regarding profit, when SR was started Bitcoin was worth far less. He needed to hire talent to help run the site and manage disputes. He didn't plan on Bitcoin getting so valuable. If Bitcoin had stayed under $10 his wallet value would still have been pretty small and we wouldn't be having this conversation. 
Ross,as far as we know, didn't spend much of his earnings and lived frugally.
Ross didn't sell drugs (except for the mushrooms on the first listing of SR which he can be faulted for here), Ross provided a platform for people to sell things. They drew the line at items that could harm others (kiddy porn etc). 
Ross goes to jail for trafficking hard drugs, meanwhile no one went to jail when the CIA imported blow to the ghettos, and US soldiers guard the poppy fields in Afghanistan. 
Ross admitted to making the site, but that he passed it off and he wasn't the primary administrator if my memory is correct.

I'm really hoping that the rumors that the election will be cancelled and martial law will be instated are just that.

Here's your order of spending prioritites if you're being wise about your finances.
1. 6 months living expenses in a high yield money market fund where you can access it easily for emergencies.
2. Paid off all debt.
3. Max out IRA or 401k
4. Other legacy investments.
5. Bitcoin and other fun money.
Never spend more on bits than you can afford to lose.

I doubt it's them wanting to be like this.
I'm guessing Uncle Sam is breathing down their necks and they're trying to spin up as many customer response reps as they can safely and effectively. None of them have probably had a full night's sleep in 3 months since the price crossed $1000.
I cannot fathom in reality what Coinbase is actually doing behind closed doors but we have to recognize this is some heavy stuff they are working on. 
I really do feel for this guy's story. But we may not know the whole story here.

I've found that a lot of them struggle with the concept of not being able to touch/hold Bitcoin. As someone who has a little gold and silver I understand the satisfaction of holding the physical value medium. It is quite nice and feels real. 
But the concept of scarcity in a digital medium is foreign to many of the older folks.

If you stay on Coinbase for a while they will increase your limit over time. Contact them and ask.

Their referral fee is also not worth it anymore. $10 collectively for hundreds in potential fees they get.
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:56:46
I do love the ease of their GUI. 
Hate the scammy ICO tokens they've included on the app over the last year. 
Still, I'm not alone in wanting an explanation for the crowdfunding snafu. 
Mycelium on it's own as a wallet is above average quality compared to others on the market. I can admit that. 
They prioritized Bcash over Segwit (I'm sure Giszmo has a technical reason for why this happened, but it still happened). 
My point is that Mycelium has strayed from the path of being the best wallet in our scene to being one that's used because Samourai isn't on iOS yet/doesn't provide fiat conversion. 
I would *love* to see Mycelium ascend to greatness and do good things for this community but all I've seen so far this year doesn't make me bullish on that possibility. Their silence on the crowdfunding issue bothers myself and others.
I'd love to be wrong. I know I'm just an armchair spectator in this contributing no code or development to their hard work and achievements. But that's my perspective on where they are. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:25:47

@_date: 2013-12-13 03:03:08
I think you'd have to scale it out for the amount you're covering. $50 a year for accounts with less than 10 bitcoins more for larger amounts. 
Maybe a tenth of a percent of the money you are holding with them annually? 
I think insurance is one of the few things keeping bitcoin from going mainstream so I'm really excited to see what you do.
I think some people would also pay simply for paper wallets under armed guard.

Coinbase still gets my win. Everything they do is stored off site. They support paper wallets. They fix every security issue they find and offer heavy bounties for people who find them. 
I'm also looking into CampBX, they seem like a contender for Coinbase in a few weeks. 
Dont use coinbase if you are trying to buy low and sell high.
