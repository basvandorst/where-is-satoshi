Yeah. People from different backgrounds have different angles, or psychologically speaking, *schemas* that we have built over our lifetimes. Schemas are mental blueprints that guides our attention to what is important for each individual.
For me, I see Bitcoin as anything it can possibly function as. People say it is digital gold, neo-world-reserve-currency, a paradigm of money, p2p cash, internet money, whatever you know? I think it can be all those things. Funny thing is, it is something so new, we haven't had a such invention in our history. It is kind of scary, so experimental it is actually yet to be defined concretely. Only time will tell.

Gradually let people know what Bitcoin is, how to use it. Later they will understand why to hold it yourself (and when it is easier).
Note that they are Even insuring it to 6000 euros! I think this good for beginners to have some understanding of Bitcoin. :)

Mental disorder is not brain damage per say. Brain damage would imply a lesion or a hit to the brain, whereas mental disorder has an imbalance of neurotransmitters. 
But yeah, I agree with you: he most definitely has a mental disorder that is fueling his malicious actions.
