Bitcoin gained more that 100% in a short time. How else you will call it if not bullrun?
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:40:16
See you in 2021 on next bullrun.
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:01:36
They have LTC, BTH, Etherum and many others. Will be enough for everybody.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:51:07
Will start in 1 hour.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:02:59
So at the end you are saying that whales do not do any pump and dump? Or they do this randomly not using any algorithms which could decide when to but and when to sell? And even if they do the algorithms are totally different because no best practices are known?
Please watch the video I posted. nowadays it is purely 'Game of speed".
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:37:11
Fuck this, now I just want my money back and peace of mind. No lambos and moons anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:50:59
Sell and enjoy your live.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:17:51
On it's way to zero.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:43:47
Those pump and dump periods became shorter and shorter.
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:23:39
It means that many people keep saying that this crash is nothing bad because btc is still much higher than year ago.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:24:33
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:33:13
This "last year" price argument will be gone in few months.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:40:52
Just cash out the enjoy the rest of your life in peace.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:32:29
Seeing all the posts here I think that more time you are here the less you know. So how long are you?
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:38:32
There are celebrating their coins' gains:
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:15:01
Bitcoin is officialy dead now.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:21:57
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:06:50
Almost 6000 now.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:12:02
"It's Just a little Crush"
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:41:27
I think that we can have some paid trolls here who was spreadding all those „to the moon”, „hodl” and „lambo” nonsense.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:07:10
Relax, just joking here. You guys are too stress out!
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:44:53
Bitcoin do it for the very last time - 10.5k and I’m out.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:54:46
Those times are gone. You need to find other way to buy it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:50:12
Yes I understand that but how can you compete with someone that have several milions of $ to invest?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:44:50
Wan't able to resist myself... but of course I hope it will be &gt; 20k.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:05:44
We are bouncing back!
@_date: 2018-02-25 08:44:40
Sold yesterday hoping for big drop. Hopefully it is on the way.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:33:34
Market changes. Hodling was great only few months ago. Now you can see for yourself how situation looks like...
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:02:11
Pure speculation. We should prepare for big dump soon.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:10:25
Yes to make a profit you have to wait till price of your asset rice and then sell with interest. Isn't this for everybody do? Please explain me what I don't understand?
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:06:24
Couting hours untill dump....
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:18:48
Who and why want to move from coinbase?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:43:49
No it's cold outside brrrrr. You cannot just throw me away like this...
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:25:08
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:27:34
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:12:53
I though that they have much more serious problems to deal with now.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:29:19
No they changed their mind:
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:13:43
now with the cash latter with loan.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:24:03
I was always wondering, couldn't we decrease mining fees? In litecoin it is done by one commit.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:28:37
Do you think that day trading is the only chance now with all this manipulation?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:51:48
Will you follow mcafee idea if not?
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:17:47
I think it's wise decision. The days of just waiting bot bitcoin price to rise are gone. If you are beginner I would recommend to use some tool for that:
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:09:44
It was too good to be true for past  several days...
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:35:08
What news?
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:23:42
How can  something decrease 300%?
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:15:19
Yes I think that banks may kill cryptos and highly profit on the same time.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:26:49
What HODLing will give you? The price will rise 1k or 2k and bots will take profit. They won’t stop as long as they have profit.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:46:33
Those who sold at 6k waiting for dip may soon celebrate.
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:16:55
Not for long.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:40:08
Today bcash really rocks:
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:48:01
Shouldn’t we just give up here? This manipulation will last forever. Sorry for all guys that bought on December...
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:06:24
To the moon!
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:12:47
Do you remember from yesterday?
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:51:51
Many guys has learned to sell on Friday on buy on Monday so can be down.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:20:24
So is hodling and hoping for some ATH the realm of past?
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:00:19
The days of simpleness are gone... But the advantages of LN are worth it ;)
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:25:08
Take off time for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:19:30
Could you send me his name?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:53:51
Do we have his wallet address to be able to monitor?
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:58:24
How many those futures are left?
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:55:38
Drop, drop, drop I want to rebuy.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:35:52
Are whales paid troll?
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:03:45
Man, you made my day :):) 
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:51:23
So many chances to sell high and buy low :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:38:33
They can be still in dip if they bought ATH.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:42:55
Ok guys it starts looking as something more than just correction...
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:54:44
Curretly we cannot beat bots. If we had much more buyers then maybe.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:47:17
One of these days we will find you whales and stick this red dildo where it belongs!
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:54:21
You can install one easily. There is zenbot or gekko or others.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:06:55
20k by end of the week
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:29:47
If the price starts rising bots will take care to take their profit drop it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:46:28
Nowadays it's whales' computers that talk to exchanges and yes millions of them do that. Strategies for buying and selling are not the same of course but similar.
The difference bit normal markets and cryptos are regulations. Whales cannot do many of those think they can do in crypto in real markets.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:04:55
Yes sir!
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:37:37
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:28:07
Maybe those trolls from G20 do something.
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:34:41
Feels like Sunday...
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:43:03
Just sold, will buy the dip. Thanks for your advice.
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:28:52
Because whales controle it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:50:44
If you are considering the few cents then yes.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:13:55
Better donate to some good purpose.
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:15:22
The war on the way?
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:49:41
In the best case.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:55:11
Rather „let’s go bots”
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:08:51
Doesn't work for me.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:53:14
Mabe we should send a letter to the Pope and ask him to pray for bitcoin tomorow?
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:42:54
Why do you still think that some single people can change anything? The market belong to whales now.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:57:51
Pump and dump - day trades paradise.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:33:42
For me the most exiting feature this year will be direct swaps. Not sure if they will work also with fiat or only between cryptos.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:17:17
We have 11k!!!! Don't let it go now.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:22:02
10k we are coming! Prepare memes.
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:05:56
We need more FUD!!!
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:22:35
Waiting for his reaction to new ATH!
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:35:05
Most probably bot.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:09:10
Stock market strategies are quite well known for years.
Quick example.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:07:47
It was so good recently that I think it's time to sell as something bad is coming...
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:00:02
Yes it is manipulation now. But this is how unregulated market works.
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:18:21
Some fortuneteller told you that?
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:30:11
Only few days ago this was a tragedy... 
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:19:46
and sell highs. I know and I'm affraid that this can be the only way right now. Hodling and hoping for some ATH are realm of past.
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:44:47
Bitcoin can stabilize at this point and this will be good news for it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:13:18
It's going for new ATH from now on.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:19:01
And the pump and dump era will really begin :)
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:49:11
I joined the whales and created custom bot. I’m using zenbot and can reccomend so far :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:36:00
It tells you to keep away from crypto!!
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:24:34
You’ve probably just sold and want the price to go down.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:34:47
Not for long keep the 10k memes ready to be fired :)
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:33:08
Whales pumped a lot so they have all rights to dump now and take the profit.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:58:07
I think one hour is one hour no matter where are you located. It will be 11:00 at my local time.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:06:55
Don't worry guys about those green candles. Bots will return in a minute and everything will be back to normal.
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:25:15
Could you buy again I’m waiting for a drop?
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:54:30
We are quite back on track, 12k till the end of the week is doable ;)
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:00:37
No because they use exchange API keys and you don’t have to give it withdraw privileges.
And it is opensourced so you can always check what it will do.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:35:17
As long as whales will have any profit from pump and dump they will continue it. Why should they stop?
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:54:28
Just buy and pump this shit.
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:50:56
Just facts and logical thinking.
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:37:36
Celebration time for SODLers
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:46:40
Your father plays dirty with your mother.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:29:34
I'm not 16 yesar old. I'm C++ developer and I was developing low latency system for automated trading bit big players so I'm somehow know what I'm saying... if you have some brain for that I would recommend to watch:
I you want your own platform then:
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:25:35
"you change your mind like a girl changes clothes"
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:26:27
Bring some food and drinks and get ready for take off.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:17:10
Isn't interest the same: to make the profit? Even strategies can be similar.
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:52:32
I also would like to know.
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:55:07
Good old days of waking up in the morning just to see red everywhere.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:27:18
Make Bitcoin Great Again!
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:34:09
No this is more like experiment ;)
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:31:45
Sell till you can and wait for a new dip!
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:04:37
I think that blockchain is ultimate solution for everything. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:35:32
I’m going to join whales and use software for high frequence trading. Will let you know the results.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:17:23
Not only yesterday...
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:48:52
Fuck I sold on Sunday...
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:25:04
I hope that you sold already as dump is coming.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:32:13
Accually I made profit. Maybe I will buy some tomorow after bigger dip.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:28:03
I will be 5k.
