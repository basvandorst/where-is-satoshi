Can you elaborate on you thoughts on why.... besides everyone thinking there is a correction coming ( since 6k ) ...
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:43:26
That's not for a while though... in bitcoin world :) big moves can happen 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:44:01
Very true. Do you think this has been consistent for all weekends 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:52:05
True, but in terms of total % there has been a few

Here's my 2c and mind you i have 0 and let me repeat 0 professional experience in short term or long term trading in any capacity. So please don't act on anything i say. its just my opinion. 
TLDR; Poor decision you should start small and understand what your doing first but what do i know...
I too have been on the fence about dropping a significant amount of money into the market and seeing what the result is.  But everyone seems to think there will be a market correction but they have though that for the past 5K and still nothing major... So is there a chance as soon as you click that purchase order the price drops and you loose all your money ? YUP. but that's just what the market is, a risk. 
It seems like you don't have a ton of experience in trading based off of your questions. None the less you should start small if investing is something your considering. Coinbase is 10 days out on processing all new account transfers. Familiarize yourself on the WHOLE process of putting money in and taking money out. Making sure you have all the necessary accounts and settings in place (read the post from earlier about the guy who just sold his last 22BTC and ran into an photo id issue). Once you feel safe buying and selling and getting your money back you will feel better about dropping serious money. 
The price is always changing if you could predict the market you would already be a millionaire.  
The big question to ask you self is are you comfortable loosing ALL of the money, because that its a possibility. ETC crashed from $300+ to .10c because of one trade. there are obviously safeguards you can put in place but the risk is still present. 
If this is some get rich quick plan... Don't... Just don't. 
Personally, saving money until you have enough you can spare for some investing is the way to go especially at such a young age.  
The fees small if done right so its not a huge factor to worry about.  
I think there is a lot of hype to get to 10k and if and when it does there will be a large amount of publicity around it and it will bring more new combers to crypto where it goes from there is anyone's guess.
Hope i helped

But you can’t own the a coin that will execute that contract or trust?

Ya I guess all I have to do is wait and hope that it comes through. It wasent a large sum of money just a test to make sure it went through properly

I have now received a total of 7 conformation emails about this 1 deposit attempt.  As long as I keep seeing action I will be hopefull, once they stop and still no coin I will be concerned I will keep it updated in case anyone else encounters similar situations 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:36:01
Ya it took about an hour to get the first conformation but now I have received 5 additional ones over the past 12 hours
