If the USA had zero debt it would be negligence

50 demonstrated the best quality of crypto : hiding assets.

Hey everyone there's a messenger! Let's shoot him

Even if you found them there are guys who can't get into their physical wallets. Or people who make dumb transfers and end up with their money in an inaccessible wallet. There's a thousand ways to screw up.    
There is this persistent idea that the big banks are predatory and the institutions are corrupt and maybe that's true to an extent. But the primary reason for the bank is that I know that I can't be trusted to look after my own personal money pile. Either I'll lose it or spill tomato sauce on it or who knows what. If it gets robbed, the fdic will make me whole. Crypto doesn't offer anything on that front. Some people believe they are perfect but I'm not ashamed of my limitations. I would screw it up for sure

This is my biggest concern about crypto. That I will forget where in the backyard I buried that coffee can

It's true that gold has no intrinsic value  neither does paper or code. These things assume the value that society places upon it.

The amount of money isn't primarily what pushes usd inflation. It's wage growth. The m3 amount of currency (Google it) is huge and there's tons of slack. Hundreds of Billions of dollars leave us borders and never come back. the govt can print a ton and no one would notice.   
And side note a currency can do 1 of 2 things: inflate or deflate. Inflation can be controlled far more easily than deflation. You actually want a little inflation every year. It's the least evil of all the outcomes

That was hugely semantic but also helpful.

Or be able to go to a hotel 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:24:34
Yes. We are at that point. Check the fine print on the last jobs numbers, wage growth has finally arrived.

Issuing debt is not the same as inflation. If it were there would have been rampant usd inflation since 2008. And that didn't happen.

Btc was also created out of thin air. The difference is that no one is creating more of it.

Chinese debt is a shadier investment than bitcoin

Be thankful that you didn't lose everything like the rest of these jackals are about to do

Oh no? Did they dig it up from a mine somewhere. Face the facts all currency, whether it is gold, paper or crypto, is only worth what people believe it to be worth. None of these things have intrinsic value. At least not as much as we pretend they do. It's all a confidence game. Gold has a 10000 year head start is all.

China was bluffing. They buy American debt every day 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:21:43
America is far from bankrupt. Think about all the assets. The National parks, the nukes, the 11 super carriers when no other country has 1. Fort knox, the robots on Mars. It's like $200-300 trillion in assets. $18 trillion in dept against 300 trillion in assets is like a home equity loan to build a new roof, even though you could pay cash. And btw the US government can always pay cash, they own the printers.

If crypto was as transformative as this sub claims, no government could stop it
