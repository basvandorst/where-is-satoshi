What kind of generator did you use out from `bitaddress.org`? If you used a brain wallet, chances are that your brain entropy was not high enough and that your phrase was cracked.

People don't upgrade their wallets overnight if they don't have a compelling reason to do so. However, every service I interacted with recently used a SegWit address (3 or bc).

Nice student project, refurbishing a machine to distribute bitcoins wallets for 1€.

Indeed. I'm considering a switch from gnucash after playing with imported data. Thanks!

One of the main research axis of the newly recruited associate professor could be smart contracts security, certification, etc.

That would require a lot of energy to steal ~2.8€.

I even wondered if it could be Craig himself writing this :-)

I don't know why you got downvoted for this, this would make sense.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:27:05
Great news!

You don't get it: is saying that no matter where the donation comes from, it should appear on the target address as announced.

It is pretty and could be a good demo, but it looks deceptive at the end. No transaction appears to be done to the charities, and you cannot do anything with the µBTC you get since you don't get the private key.

I fail to see how this forum project, which is interesting per se, is any bitcoin specific.

If they were actually able to verify that the recipient of the shared send never received the bitcoins, does that mean that they are keeping mixer logs for months? Isn't untraceability the whole point of this mixing service?

They claim they allow you to claim the BTC to a coinbase wallet. With my setup at least, this prove impossible as I couldn't reach the last steps (Firefox/Linux). Could anyone?

This is where bitcoin can help you as no other proof will ever be required other than the bitcoin payment itself.
Oh, wait…
