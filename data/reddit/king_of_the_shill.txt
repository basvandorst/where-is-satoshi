That's pretty cool. It'd be neat to add some kind of indication of inputs and outputs too - like a link between spheres that involved the same coins.

Incorrect. You can run bitcoind - or any other piece of server software for that matter - on any port you want. Bitcoin has no claim to this port.

Obviously, bitcoin would need to support more than the current 2.7 confirmed transactions per second - which is often not enough even today.
LN (vaporware), Sidechains (vaporware), and off-chain solutions - whatever that means - and bigger blocks would increase performance but COULD mean a hard fork - and good luck getting the bitcoin community to support that.
If you ask me, going forward, bitcoin needs a way to evolve - any way. Rather than wallowing in argument about how to procede. 
Edit: Bring on the downvotes. Doesn't change the facts.

Dropbox is probably a BAD place for wallet storage. Any of your devices with dropbox installed and your account logged in is a potential breach point. In addition to the dropbox servers themselves, but I think this is much less likely.
Don't bother wasting your time &amp; money with Sytech or whoever. Maybe you can find how the wallet was accessed, but probably not. Either way, it won't bring the coins back.
It sounds like your wallet did not have a password, that probably would have helped. Look into printing your private keys on paper, that's probably the most secure way.

You should probably read the terms of service you agreed to when signing up with your internet provider.
TOS aside, literally any competent systems administrator will agree that email servers on residential ISPs equate to spammers, specifically, spamming malware.
That point aside as well, I bet your email server is improperly configured. I bet you don't have DKIM and I guarantee you don't have proper reverse DNS.


If you're only sending mail to close individuals, why do you care what AT&amp;T thinks of your email?

Perhaps you don't understand bitcoin at all but the the total number of bitcoins in no way shape or form limits the number of assets that can be "authenticated" via bitcoin's blockchain.
Or perhaps you're referring to coin ownership. Coins can be divided infinitely, FYI.

DVD/CD is a bad idea too. Burnable disks work by using a special "ink" that the burner laser interacts with. However, this ink expires over time and data is corrupted. On the other hand, professionally made CDs the data is physically embedded, and will last much longer. But this technique is beyond the reach of an average joe.
More info: 
Hard disks are a bad idea as well. They contain moving parts and these can seize over time if left idle too long. SSDs are no better, they store a small electrical charge that keeps your data in the memory cells "alive". Go too long without an external power source, and your data is gone.
Paper is probably the safest.

How is this achieved? I assume the device supports firmware updates in some manner, how could a host machine be prevented from pushing and update that simply gives away all your coinz?
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:01:45






Apparently you didn't read, CD/DVDs don't degrade because of quality issues, they degrade for the same reason that makes it possible to write to them in a home computer.
Hard drives don't only go bad through use and abuse, they go bad because like any mechanical device they have components that are only meant to last so long. Lubricant that keeps the platters spinning dries out. Seals keeping contaminants out dry and crack.
Why would you leave your money up to chance? Digital solutions are "cooler" and easier but would you want to worry about your money for yet another reason? Every post you see here about lost coinz, the OP had shitty or no backups. Bitcoin is supposed to be better than banks (who go absolutely insane for data retention), yet you're throwing around your money like it's some save files to game you play.
Paper (stored in different banks deposit boxes, ironically enough) or those metal things from the front page the other day is probably your best idea yet, in terms of data longevity.

Why would multiple copies of a flawed medium for long term storage matter? Now you have **multiple** slowly-corrupting lumps of plastic. This is not a question of IF the media degrades, it's a question of WHEN. You are not ready to be your own bank.

So... Technical question.
Having a copy of the blockchain and whatever fraction of a bitcoin, how do I track where the coins I hold have been and came from? Or is it only downstream, but still how?
@_date: 2015-05-10 06:22:42
Why? Code is code. "Science" would be calculating the ideal parameters you want the blockchain to obey, then modifying or writing code to deliver exactly that.
If the protocol is messing with how the market operates like you're suggesting... Then the entire system has a major problem.

Total misunderstanding - when the floppy disk was first invented, it's usage took off. This is the first half, the upward part of the hyperbolic curve.
Obviously floppy disks are rarely used today, so its usage clearly has decreased after it's peak. This is the second half, the downward part of the hyperbolic curve.

No. Driving the slowest you can go in your top gear saves the most gas. For the average consumer car, that's designed to be somewhere in the 60-70 mph range, for maximum efficiency on highways.

On What, it varies with how much you've downloaded and what percent of torrents you've downloaded in the past you're still seeding. In any case, the highest minimum you'll need to maintain is 0.6. I've had absolutely no problem maintaining this myself, even on a home internet connection, no fancy vpn, no seedbox, etc. It's about setting up your client *correctly* and patience.

Wouldn't going back to basics and printing a QR code be much simpler? The iPhone adds too much complexity... The flash storage could die at any moment, ditto for the battery burning up the phone. Not to mention the iPhone is an electronic device, thus is fundamentally less secure. If you backup the phone your backups are just as vulnerable as the device itself. Ditto for what the backups are stored on.

Uhh, this is exactly what he did. When a convict fails to cooperate with authorities, they are generally given a stricter sentence than a person. Whereas, what Ross did is save the authorities some work, and this will be reflected in his sentencing. I'm not saying he'll get a free pass for helping a tiny bit, the difference would be maybe a few years shorter sentence, or better parol options. It's really up to how the judge is feeling. What Ross did was in his on best interest.
