Well then maybe I misunderstood what u were trying to say &amp; I apologize. Indians &amp; Pakistanis are always together. It's the media which destroys &amp; corrupts the image of relationships between people from different countries. I have many close Indian friends &amp; we keep in touch regularly. And no it's not an incendiary topic :)

Why ? Why wud u b a dick on a thread where no one is hating anyone ? There's always one idiot who starts it &amp; then others follow. Please stop &amp; delete ur silly comment ! Typical desi mentality bcoz of which we're so far behind !
