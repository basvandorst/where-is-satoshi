I guess rich is subjective.


I know people that bought at 200usd who have millions now, so that's not true, but I guess it depends how much you invest.
I'd say 10x is a conservative estimate next rally / after the halving.
I've been in since 2012 and I've heard untold people talk about how it's too late, and they've always been wrong.
Btc isn't going anywhere,  I understand people's frustration at feeling they've missed the boat, but they haven't.
I'd never touch shitcoins personally,  it's straight up gambling. You might as well just head to the roulette table.

@_date: 2018-08-29 16:43:00
Say you have ten states that are roughly equal in wealth.
9 of these embrace BTC and steadily accumulate.
One state decides to ban BTC and spends years fighting it.
BTC becomes world currency. The price is now 1000x.
The other 9 countries have 1000x the wealth of the one that decided to fight BTC. Not even taking into account how much money it burned trying to fight BTC.
How did that country not cripple itself?
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:24:56
It's different with BTC because of the limited number of coins.
If one state tries to fight it for any length of time, while all the rest load up, they have totally just crippled themselves in the new global financial hierarchy.

I've had multiple bans from r/btc.  I can't believe anyone actually believes the "uncensored" bs.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:41:11


If you say there is a wealth transfer going on that causes significant harm to some group of people (original assertion; some countries will be "crippled"), then there are discussions at every level if it should be allowed to continue unchecked, if different policy should be enacted, etc.
Again, if you understood bitcoin, you'd understand that it doesn't matter who thinks what.  Bitcoin is against the interest of every government that prints its own fiat currency. They'd all love to destroy it (If they aren't the one that secretly created it)  but they can't, they just can't. Sure, they could attempt to ban it within their own state, but that wouldn't work, but for the most part it's because they're scared of being the state that cripples itself.  You can tell China and Russia are terrified of the possibility its a USA creation, but then they can't take the risk of a ban potentially crippling them.
Bitcoin is something totally new, it can't be controlled, they'll either get on board, or they'll get rekt. They aren't stupid, they worked this out already.
The legacy financial system is rapidly becoming irrelevant.
I strongly suggest some in-depth research on bitcoin.
In a few years time the world is going to look very different, most people seemingly have no idea it's happening right now, but it doesn't have to be a surprise.
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:12:22
If you could buy it with half an apple then I expect it's value would be roughly half an apple.
You could get lucky though I guess, maybe some guy was given a pineapple, yet he doesn't like pineapples, so he might be up for trading it for half an apple.

@_date: 2018-08-29 17:35:01
So when all my friends bought BTC at 12USD other than me, I'm not fucked relative to them?
Yes, I still have my job and my standard of living is the same, but it's effectively much lower relative to theirs.
Whether its a person or a state that gets in early, the result is the same.
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:20:19
I wonder why the not insignificant discrepancy.
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:01:54
Oh wow, yes the country isn't actually losing anything (other than the money it wastes trying to fight btc).
However, it is losing wealth relative to all other countries.
Wealth is relative.
BTC is the equivalent of gold nuggets littering the floor.  If everyone else collects them and you don't, you just financially crippled yourself compared to everyone else. Regardless of the fact you can still go to work and get paid the same amount or sell your car for the same amount.
As countries accumulate the price will rise continually, obviously the later you start to buy, the less you get for the same amount of wealth.

*Extremely* early has nothing to do with it.
There is a clear sliding scale between early and late adopters.
Yes, early adopters benefit, at the expense of who? Drum roll... the later adopters.
Who loses the most wealth on this sliding scale?  You guessed it, the last adopters.
Yes it will scale up, with the effect steadily diminishing, that's exactly what the bitcoin algorithm is programmed to ensure.  


Moral or ethical has/will have nothing to do with it.  Something we should allow? You do understand what decentralised means right? 


As I stated earlier:
"Obviously, all states would not adopt at the same time and same rate, but this doesn't change the fact that the wealth will be distributed in proportion to how early a state adopts."  
So fuck off with your strawman bullshit.
You obviously have very little knowledge or understanding of bitcoin, so unsurprisingly you seem oblivious as to the way bitcoin actively punishes those that try and oppose it.  Bitmain for example. The irony being that bitcoin is a topic clearly outside your grasp.
If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.

Think about it, the Gov with the most to lose (current reserve currency, petrodollar etc) if BTC succeeds (assuming they didn't create it themselves) is the USA... Yet they have objectively been among the most relaxed Gov's.
Their traditional opponents however, Russia, China etc, have all made moves and noises about banning. Perhaps they suspect, or know, the US is (likely to be) behind it.
There's a couple of links below that expand on the idea.
However, in around 2013 I remember reading something, it was a white paper/proposal, whatever you want to call it, actually released by the US gov (CIA, NSA, I forget, but it was the alphabet boys) long before bitcoin came to be. It basically describes bitcoin almost perfectly... They even went so far as to write about using a name as the supposed creator.  The name was laughably similar to Satoshi Nakamoto, something like Suzuki Yamamoto.  I kid you not.  I just did a quick search (no time ATM) and don't seem to be able to find anything about it at all now... Which I find a little suspicious in itself...

Obviously, all states would not adopt at the same time and same rate, but this doesn't change the fact that the wealth will be distributed in proportion to how early a state adopts.
It's reasonable to assume that a state which actively fights adoption will be a very late adopter, effectively losing wealth to the majority of states who adopted earlier.

Yes, it does mean that you fucking moron.
    People with IQ's of 80-90 are a little on the slow side but may be found in fast-food restaurants, day-care centers, etc. They may also be found in unskilled jobs. About 16% of the population has IQ's in this range.  
    People with IQ's of 90-110 generally occupy semi-skilled positions, including typists, receptionists, assembly line workers, and checkout clerks. They are able to keep up with the world, and comprise about 46% of the public.  
    People with IQ's in the 110 to 120 range fill the skilled trades and include some tool and die makers, teachers, and Ph. D.'s among their ranks. They also make up 16% of the population. 
    People with IQ's of 120 and above tend to staff the professions as doctors, dentists, lawyers, teachers, and college professors. They fall in the upper 10% of the population. 
    Note that there are lots of exceptions...  many, many people working in jobs for which they are overqualified. For example, there are waiters and waitresses who are working their way through college.

Oh, I see what you mean. Obviously it's not a backup.  Though thinking "Nor would there be any reason to move coins if a hardware wallet fails..." makes no sense to me, if I need to transact,  a hardware failure doesn't negate that need. Indeed, the time I'm most likely to encounter/discover a device failure is while I'm trying to transact.  Aside from the obvious inability to send btc, If someone is to send me coin I need the ledger to generate receiving address.

It's useful to have redundancy, the device isn't going to last forever. You can bet that if you just have one and it bites the dust, something will happen to necessitate moving your coins.  If you have "real" money in BTC the 90usd, or how much they cost these days is nothing for peace of mind.

Of course, though for the small cost I just keep at least two with the same seed. Personally I'd rather not potentially compromise my seed using software wallet, or wait for a new device to be delivered.
If people baulk at the cost of a spare Ledger/Trezor, they don't have "real" money in BTC.

I don't think you understand. I keep two hardware wallets, incase I lose or break one. If I just had one, and it got broken or was lost I'd have to wait for another to be delivered to transact.
I never said anything about "backups" or seed backups.
I keep both my wallets configured with my seed... because it's my seed. 
For the amount of btc I own the cost of a second hardware wallet is totally inconsequential. I bought the second last year when there was was a waiting time in months for delivery.
It's called being prepared.

Ideally you should be using a passphrase anyway, this acts as a 25th word and creates a different seed.  Use something you won't forget for passphrase and don't write down. That way if anyone ever sees your seed you're still good. On Ledger you can bind the passphrase to a pin so you don't have to enter it every time.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:40:30
The USD price is irrelevant.
You need to value coins against BTC


Etherum priced in BTC:
24 Hours	-0.6%
7 Days	-4.1%
14 Days	-21.5%
30 Days	-21.0%
60 Days	-27.3%
1 Year	-21.3%
I expect mostly its the same across the rest of the shitcoins.


Wrong,  it's bitcoin thats showing the gains, it's just that the rising bitcoin tide lifts all shitcoin ships.


Wrong, biticon dominance is higher now than it was last July... despite the how many hundreds more shitcoins trying to take a bite?

Weren't they ones based on ridiculous decisions by the ref? Wasn't the ref an Argie? Who the Croats punished 3-0?  I think there should probably be a rule against that situation.
Also, I can't escape the feeling that the governing body and mainstream media etc would have done anything in their power to try and produce a multicultural winning team rather than an evil homogeneous white team.
I honestly feel the legit score was/should have been 2-2 and have gone to penalty shootout like Croatia's other previous games. The handball decision, in particular, was suspect as fuck IMO.
Honestly, I think Croatia would *probably* still have lost, but it would have been fair. The way it went down just stinks.

In my experience, anyone under 30 ish is usually pretty fluent in English.
You're right, it's an awful language to try and learn. I mean the basics like learning words is easy, but then it becomes an incredibly steep learning curve.
Zagreb is my second home, yet I'm still at a basic level, despite being married to a Croatian for years.  The problem is there's just not enough motivation to learn more, as nearly everyone you're likely to *need* to talk to speaks English.
