I love when people cite the USA’s debt like it matters and like they know anything about its implications.

So many of these posts hint at the fact BTC is the first investment for a lot of people.

You most definitely can see swings like this with stocks - especially if you’re speculating with penny stocks, small caps, emerging markets, etc.  
Why would dips and swings scare you if you’re holding a long position? If you’re trying to day trade/swing trade these cryptos then you’re playing a fool’s game.

Timing the market is a fools game. Time in the market is your greatest advantage.

Not surprising. In Canada I know they have very strict rules that govern the banks and credit unions that fall under “Anti Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Policy”. Given the nature of cryptos, the banks don’t want to be involved in case the individuals you’re trading crypto with are criminals or terrorists.

You shouldn’t be touching cryptos if you’re so financially unstable that losing your crypto ruins your Christmas. 
* You setup an emergency fund that is risk free and liquid. 
* You setup medium term savings for property purchases or education for your kids
* You setup long term savings for your retirement. 
* Then you can start fucking around with BTC and cryptos.

Spicy headline. A 1.00 donation will take $30 and 6 hours to process.

Lol. You’re assuming no person or institution is going to take profit? There could likely be the beginning of a cascade of profit taking at any moment. Please show the evidence of which other assets are currently being sold to buy BTC.

Are you even covering your electricity usage?

It’s almost as if it’s a bubble.

Lol. Hopefully in the next 8 years it isn’t regulated out of existence or eclipsed by a superior coin. Hilarious that anyone thinks they can predict this shit. You all subscribe to read some tech blogs, watch some videos on Facebook, and suddenly everyone’s an expert.
