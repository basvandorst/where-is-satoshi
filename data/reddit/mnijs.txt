Original 21mln btc supply is believed to have envisioned a market cap at USD 21 trillion, which was the value of global cash at that time, and that implied 1 satoshi to be the equivalent of 1 cent.

None of the above is a peer to peer system... 
Once again, this is not blind maximalism, just a mere observation that your bitcoin is actually on the blockchain and not on any device or in any wallet. All you need is a private key to move them from any device or any wallet.
Learning this is more important than being able to trade bitcoin "like a pro". I know this because I studied bitcoin for 3 years before obtaining my first bitcoin. And no, I have never paid a penny for bitcoin.

I believe everyone should start by interacting with Bitcoin Core first. Not because I am a maximalist or shit like that, but to understand the basics of bitcoin protocol. That's how I started. Bitcoin Core, dumpprivkey etc and then mobile Electrum for transactional purposes. 
Many years after "mastering bitcoin" did I order Trezor and Ledger only to realize it is too superficial, much like having sex in thick gloves and condom.
If you never saw a private key in your life I say you failed or will eventually fail. Guaranteed.

You are all missing the point. True that bitcoin custody must be with the owner, but this way at least banks will recognize bitcoin as an asset class and will not block your account when you try to wire funds to an exchange. Up to this date banks look at bitcoin like toxic waste. This should open up more opportunities.

What difference does it make whether you trade real bitcoin or paper bitcoin. As a day trader you don't need bitcoins to spend them, you want to make money on the ups and downs, with your ultimate profits shown in fiat. 
Even gold/oil traders do not move gold/oil around, just speculate on price.

This isn't related to blockchain or bitcoin. It is the trading platform and lack of liquidity. If you want to buy bitcoin but there are no sellers the price can go to infiniti. Diligent traders use limit orders to avoid these things.
What happened, someone had to buy urgently and placed a market order. To fill the order fully, he had to buy some at 41K because there were not enough sellers near the market price. The price was recorded because an actual trade happened at that price.
You do not see this but in all markets there are bids and asks at extreme levels from the market price. Someone for example has a buy limit order now to buy bitcoin at $1. Who would sell at this price? Nobody, except if you are not careful and place a market order (not a limit order) at a time of low volume and liquidity, and you trigger all bid orders down to the $1 as well...

Thank you. So the answer is no. No unique and single solution, but multiple. There can be two hashes with 20 leading zeros, but otherwise different from each other as far as remaining bits are concerned. This makes sense because there are infinite numbers, and many other nonces could give you 20 leading zeros.

The beauty of censorship resistance... A miner can pretend to blacklist the address and produce the block withhout that transaction. It will be validated by all nodes. Next honest miner may include this transaction, and every node will still validate. Only this poor miner will have a dilemma-confirm this new block and proceed to next or reject all blocks with this transaction and carry out its own forked chain? Consensus is a powerful fuckin thing. One miner with its prejudiced approach is helpless and orphaned.

A mobile wallet is not actually a trade off between convenience and security. A mobile wallet can be the safest wallet out there, provided you have a seed backup.

It is more like a high school final exam, not too difficult. Depends how much you know about bitcoin though. Funny thing is, the exam requires payment in bitcoin only, and that is a test on its own. If you used bitcoin wallets to transact you are probably half way through. 
Here is the study guide
 [ 
You can just use this to research the internet to clarify those aspects you don't know. The generic questions such as what is money etc are easy. Concentrate on cryptography, mining and wallets, i.e. the technical stuff specific to bitcoin. 
The exam is mostly true/false choices, but pace is very fast. You have to answer questions within 16 seconds on average (20 minutes for 75 questions).
If you use bitcoin on a regular basis you are probably a bitcoin professional without the exam.
Andreas Antonopoulos, who is on board of this exam, can answer almost all your questions. Just google topics, and if you see one of his videos definitely watch it. Last but not least, if you read through his book Mastering Bitcoin you are good to go.

Here is the truth if you can read blockchain.
170BTC was transferred 2 days ago, then a chain reaction of laundering was started leading to 98 "stolen". My opinion? The bastard was the scam itself.
There isn't a single change address involved in the transactions. A well orchestrated coin control scam to avoid any proof of wallet ownership?
@_date: 2019-10-22 14:48:49
Which wallets you using for a start? Make a written note on the seed backup with reference to that wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:26:33
I suggest use this:
Proxy for stocks, use S&amp;P 500
(no need for NASDAQ or DJIA since they represent specific industry stocks, while SP500 is for all sectors)
Proxy for bonds, use an ETF that tracks bonds in one way or another, for example
ETFs and Mutual funds ignore. ETFs usually track indices anyway, and mutual funds are simply too varied to put them in one basket.
For commodities perhaps
For REITS and property related perhaps
For cryptos use any resource that provides easy price data export, for example  [  or CoinGecko as mentioned, but it will get complicated with API tools etc.
If you need to analyse them once as of today then you can use CSV files and work on Excel. If you need dynamicly updated prices you need developer level knowledge (either Excel Macros or Python etc).
Good luck.

@_date: 2019-12-13 09:14:04
Here is a solution.
1. Open a pro account at bequant.io
They are more responsible account managers and bequant is basically the owner of hitbtc or some kind of partners. You will see interface is same.
2. Do your KYC with them. Once verified tell them you wanna transfer your crypto to bequant from hitbtc, so please instruct hitbtc to unblock funds since you did kyc with bequant successfully. 
3. Keep this post updated.

You got it all wrong. You don't need many wallets. Use one wallet, send to multiple addresses within, make a copy of the private keys in paper. Nothing can go wrong with private keys. Things can possibly go wrong with .dat backups, or wallets seeds or whatever.

OK I am not saying stop using a computer, but if you dig deeper you will realize you can generate a private key by flipping a coin 256 times, and use the resulting binary. Once again, this isn't my vision of bitcoin use, but the more you shake it to pieces the better you understand the moving parts so you know what can go wrong and why. I heard the other day someone purchased a Trezor because he is excited about buying BTC for first time. Now if you use a Trezor with zero clue what it does and why, is not very safe in my opinion.

You can't physically short bitcoin, or leverage it by borrowing actual bitcoin. Whenever exchanges offer these means it is all paper bitcoin and to settle positions they don't even need physical delivery of bitcoin. So margin calls should not affect bitcoin spot rates.

Let me put it this way, I have more than your mentioned amount, and all saved in Core wallet addresses, priv keys printed. I tested importing a key into Electrum, works like a charm. That's why I am sure a private key is the best backup, for it is a permanent thing, while other protocols may undergo updates and you need to keep track. 
I never used Trezor etc and never will.
Obviously there is no harm in spreading over multiple wallets, but make sure you export priv keys from each one. At the end of the day, a wallets are a collection of private keys. And any private keys is as good as the other.
If toy trust too much the technology it may backfire. Learning to work with priv keys you force yourself to speak the developer language, and shake all wallets into pieces.

@_date: 2019-09-24 21:34:46
True. It is not like when you order sell the whole community sells like sheep. What I meant is that bitcoin has no intrinsic value to offer a concrete floor on price. If you meant everyone sell and lets see how many offline wallets there are, fair enough. To be honest, most serious people have no time to lurk in these forums anyway...

Higher hash rate means more mining equipment, meaning higher costs. In fact, this could be a bearish indicator, because what do the miners do with their bitcoins? That's right, sell them hard after 100 blocks.

I am sure your private keys are fine. You just need a correct importing format depending on the wallet. I suggest use Electrum, and find out what is the correct migrating prefix. Can you give the first characters of the address?
Basically there are three address types, starting with 1, 3 or bc1. Depending on your address you can use Electrum to sweep private keys using the below prefixes
p2pkh:KxZcY47uGp9a...       	-&gt; 1DckmggQM...
p2wpkh-p2sh:KxZcY47uGp9a... 	-&gt; 3NhNeZQXF...
p2wpkh:KxZcY47uGp9a...      	-&gt; bc1q3fjfk...
Your private key starts with L instead of K, which is fine.
Use this website for reference
Needless to say, most private key related errors are typing errors so make sure not a single character is misspelled

Zero dependence on any gadgets actually helps understand the core protocol to the point that one day you may not even need a wallet, just have a script and your private key as a variable to spend from anywhere without even a proper interface. This kind of thing is impossible to make mainstream, but this way you become an elite bitcoiner as far as knowledge is concerned.

Ehm, not sure your last paragraph is accurate. You extrapolate current conditions to the future. I mean, 100 years ago finding the square root of 48995028777495038261190 was prob impossible or required weeks of effort and energy. But a small calculator can do it in seconds and doesn't exactly consume same energy. So if algorithm changes so does efficiency. Think 500 actual horses vs a 500 horse power engine.

I find it hard to believe. When you demonstrate such a thing try to actually break an actual encryption.

i had 12 btc locked in hitbtc, went through same shit, eventually approved and withdrew forever.
I actually hacked their system. Apparently they have a twin website, called bequant. More like their mother website. Check it to see almost identical interface. So opened an account as a pro trader, looks like they have more competent team, asked them to tell hitbtc to quickly verify account so as to move funds to bequant and trade with them. Literally took me 5 minutes to withdraw all btc... Left a thank you note too, some worthless-airdropped shitcoins in the account.
