If that's a normal Bitcoin transaction, anywhere from 10 mins to a few hours. Probably hours given the volume being traded.

Um, what is this rubbish? It's nothing to do with fractional lending or cash requirements at all, it's just that the banks who are stopping some transfers are the ones already getting investigated for money laundering and other shady stuff, and don't want to involve themselves in something that they claim is risky so that they can say 'look we were good guys' when they front the royal commission. Same reason that ATM fees suddenly vanished overnight. 'Look we changed and we're doing nice things now, please don't fine us $10 trillion'.
If I buy some bitcoin does it magically make that money completely vanish from the economy, starting a chain reaction which will lead to Australians lining up to eat at soup kitchens because there is no dollerz left? No, the money gets shuffled into a different bank account, maybe even at the same bank. No money is created or destroyed during the crypto buying or selling process.
Pretend you buy some bitcoin from me with cash. It goes from your leather wallet into my leather wallet, the same handful of notes continues to exist.

Seems obvious, yes. But if we chant a meme repeatedly then it beats all market psychology, right?

Not a very convincing piece of fluff, mate. Sure you fixed this guy's account as a token gesture but it looks like most other people's entire lives are basically on hold while you fuck them over with huge amounts in limbo for no reason whatsoever.
Hire more staff than you're currently hiring, and you only need to give them access to read tickets to see which ones you need to fix right now. Surely any uni grad can do that, and the measly amount you pay them will surely help you unlock / fix / otherwise sort out accounts which would pay for themselves in 1 single transaction if the person ever wants to deal with you again.

He knows how to pump and dump to his minions and their bots. Give him that much.
