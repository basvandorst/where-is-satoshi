It REALLY just isn’t that simple..
You just can’t assume that all of those people will hodl until $1m bitcoin, it’s such a bad assumption.
Just because 25% are active in bitcoin investment, you can’t assume they will all hold BTC without 1. Taking profit, 2. Cycling in and out of their investment only when BTC is needed, etc.

He has publicly said he would only do 1 more term max. So 4-5 years as Treasury Secretary maximum.
His statement is technically correct and you have just been trolled.

So you’re telling me 25% of the population will hold Bitcoin WITHOUT SELLING UP before $1m in your hypothetical world?
Do you realise how much of the population lives paycheck to paycheck, how much of the population actually invests money at all?
Sorry to say, your calculations are wildly unrealistic, as unfortunate as it is - I’d love a $1m BTC.

UX isn’t the issue IMO, if you were to read my comment above.. it IS there for airline sites, yet they aren’t used by a huge proportion of people in these countries. Whether right or wrong, a huge number of people won’t use BTC as they can’t see and feel it, even though I AGREE it would make their lives easier/better. That’s reality. The UX makes a marginal difference to people’s ingrained perceptions of how to manage their finances, what’s safe and what’s not.
You’re welcome for the downvote. Are you somehow entitled not to be downvoted if I don’t agree with your comment? Honestly, I’m just giving my opinion, upvoting comments I find useful and downvoting those I think are bad information. That’s how this works...

This assumes global or at least widespread adoption in parallel with traditional fiat.
Yeah, agreed. But that’s one hell of an assumption. May as well say ‘Assuming BTC hits 1 million, I think it’ll hit 1 million.
In many parts of the world, the majority of people would rather go to an airport to buy a physical ticket just because it’s tangible, than pay half the price by buying online. 
This is a very, VERY common attitude among the 2.7 billion unbanked you’re relying on.

Yeah you definitely got that last part right, you do fucking suck!
