Consolidated list of reource. I was searching for this kind since a while. Thanks buddy!

It's an epic movie, worth watching it with English subtitles, as the actual dialogues are in Hindi.

Sorry!! I am new to crypto world. Curiosity made me to start studying crypto market by analysing the charts. Not a miner or a investor. Maybe in future I will buy some crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:23:04

That's cool dude��

Only for negative news. I feel until next HF, it keeps increasing towards 7k, who knows it might cross it too. After HF, it may stagnate or might ride towards 10k. New year Bonanza for the holders.

I feel buy on bifinex OR BITTREX, transfer it to bithumb or gdax and convert it to USD
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:31:49
Hmm. Currency pair is btc/krw, but price displayed in dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:47:34
Can someone tell me what's the difference between anonymous transaction and confidential transaction?

@_date: 2017-11-28 09:37:22

I don't think they can ban overnight as the majority of BTC is mined by Chinese companies. It might be something similar to recent ico ban news. They will come again with some regulations in a day or two, until then there will be blood bath in crypto markets
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:53:01
This is so good. Nice poster buddy��
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:49:26

@_date: 2017-09-13 14:03:13
Are you serious? Do they have a pumping group on telegram? This surprises me a lot!! All these days I thought it was bittrex with a group of traders who were doing these pumping and dumping to make profits out it.
