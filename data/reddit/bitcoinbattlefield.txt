That should be easy! After all, it's just a series of tubes! A banana could shut down the internet.

I thought that was it, but it looks just like live updates. If you see something I don't, please let me know.

Thanks dude.

Good job boys, and a great weekend.  I managed to fanboy my way into having a beer with him at the Loose Moose after party.  Genuine, humble dude.

I've drunk the bitcoin coolaid, and I'm a strong defender of the technology, but I don't know enough about american tax law to counter his arguments. Is it just an opinion piece that panders to bitcoin bears? I've read many of those and almost all of them are written by missinformed or ignorant people with a platform. With this one, I just wanted to get a rebuttle from someone (or the community as a whole), as to why this guy's full of shit. Bitcoin to the moon, all day, I'd just like some combative ammo to shoot back against this type of argument.

Inigo Montoya couldn't have said it better. It seems like 90% of the perception (assumptions) about bitcoin aren't based in fact. Inconceivable!

Nevermind, got it.

If I have $1000 of bitcoin, and hypothetically bitcoin goes up 1000X,I make $1,000,000 after I cash out, I will end up paying 15% long term gain taxes. So I have made $850,000.
If I store $1000 in my bank, I'm guaranteed to lose 2-3% every year to the monetary inflation, and so I end up with even less.
You make an excellent point. That's precisely the tax trouble I'm looking to have lol. See! Fighting perceived logic with actual logic! Thanks dude!

That's also a great point I didn't consider. I may use any tax incured tax savings to buy 'Tax Law for Dummies'...or weed and Doritos. Either way.
