It might be because those people aren't real Keynesians, but only like some parts like QE while they probably would object to having the state run a surplus during a boom.

Do America have an economics blog like the Swedish blog "[Ekonomistas]( where economists discuss actual econ research?

Now don't get me wrong, crypto currencies and block chains will and already are transforming economics as we speak, but the full value of that transformation is neither yet visible nor is certain to mirror itself into the valuation of a Bitcoin.
Let's call it Economics 101, because that's what everyone talks about when they want to criticize arguments based upon basic economic theories. However, due to crypto currencies being as unregulated as they are, those basic theories tend to be pretty... accurate.
Look at the current chart for Bitcoin, and compare it with the [four phases of a bubble](( And I know, a lot of people will get mad now...
Do you spot the similarities? The take-off? The first small dip? The bear trap? When media began writing about it passing 8000 USD? The greed and delusion that we've seen everywhere since then? The new paradigm as the coin closed in on 20000 USD? The drop to 12500 before people started to buying because it was cheap? Yupp, that's a bubble.
I'm not saying that Bitcoin will be doomed to stay at ~3000 USD. Or that it might drop to 1000 USD before returning to some mean growth. But I'm saying that the underlying value of a Bitcoin, given the uncertain time frame for when the coins upsides will start to push it's mean growth as well as the uncertainty of if Bitcoin is going to be the gold standard in the future, isn't anywhere close to the 20000 USD that we were seeing a week before Christmas but rather somewhere around 2-4000 USD where the mean growth would have put it.
But yeah, that's Economics 101 and I'll probably be flamed for it. Even though the basics of crypto currencies is just this... that you leave regulation which perverts markets.

When even the taxi driver talks stocks, it’s time to get out.

People are dumb, and that's why they tend to treat bitcoin and block chain technology in the same way... and this is regardless if you're pro or anti bitcoin.

Or this new currency, Bitcoin Plastic.
