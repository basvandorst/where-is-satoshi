I'm glad you're laughing, but [this]( really is something to be concerned about and we need to come together and help push segwit and LN as fast as we can in 2018 or this is going to end up being one of those "posts that didn't age well" moments

sadly every company has a list like this. fiat is a bitch. coinbase being the most popular is obviously going to have the longest list.

lightning requires segwit adoption, that's what scares me a bit. If we're sitting steady at 10% adoption for segwit, will lighning take as long for adoption?

Lol this seems weird. Circumcision is not nearly as big a concern as many other things going on right now. Sure you can argue about the sensitivity, but overall it's not ruining people's lives to be circumcised besides the incredibly small amount that are botched.
Just seems like something that can be shelved until we've taken care of some more serious and actually impending health issues
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:25:48

If they follow through, it will be confirmation that it truly is a manpower issue with Coinbase/ GDAX, and should be very encouraging to all with funds transfer problems. I will update this post when/if funds are actually received back.
Good thing you spread a fuck load of FUD in the meantime though! They get over 100k new users a day, and you fucking cancelled a wire of 40k. That's not exactly something that shouldn't be reviewed in the first place. 
Seriously, I blame no one but yourself. and considering how much info you put on your post, you're obviously a huge fucking idiot in the first place

His point is that 100 dollars can only be used for a purchase with that one business though. So you actually proved his point that fiat is still way more convenient and just makes more sense

Gemini doesn't have segwit or batching either, so please stop suggesting them. they are no better than coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:04:33
the majority of the front page was about buying the dip and holding through previous crashes though.
The people who were saying the bubble burst were few, far between, and downvoted
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:33:59
is that 5 dollars not worth you getting your transaction completed and not sent back to a wallet you can't access anymore? seems strange to have that mindset

denial and delusion
Apparently I'm a Roger Ver shill because I want bitcoin to actually have a scaling solution that works TODAY. Not 6 months from now. 
I honestly think the fees are why we hit the ceiling of 20k in december. Fees were like 45-50 dollars at the time. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it had nothing to do with it. But to act like the fees aren't a problem seems like you're an apple fanboy defending the audio jack being taken away.

@_date: 2018-01-07 23:39:07
i'm not championing for bch. I didn't even say it's a good thing. I just said the devs inability to even try to temporarily fix the problem is what caused gavin, roger and the other schmucks to run off. Obviously there's more to it than just that (they wanted to make money off the fork), i'm just saying there's a select handful that make the final decisions for btc, not the hundreds and hundreds working on the open source project

if you don't know then don't treat it like he did, it's that simple

Exactly, can you imagine Visa praising their system to be hard to use because it helps people find better ways?
That's not how it works, you make it easy or they go somewhere else. Fuck this community is so delusional at times it hurts, bitcoin can be great - but you have to help make it great, not hope others find a better way, that's how you get left behind

so does ari shaffir, joe rogan makes sure to tell me about it every time it gets brought up
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:06:43
their fees are still cheaper though. so the fees you consider low, are high to them
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:32:25
they are literally no better then coinbase though. No segwit, no batching
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:32:04
that doesn't get you clicks though. welcome to reddit, where OP sucks
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:15:18
They aren't spamming the blockchain though. Sure there are more efficient ways, but it's not spam - they are legitimate paid-for transactions
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:26:58
Yea but then we'd look like fools after making fun of bch for doing it and saying that's not the solution.
The devs are literally making blogs saying high fees are a good thing. It's making me uneasy

so what's the point, you're too retarded?

@_date: 2018-01-15 00:59:01
yea we're trying so hard to make them look bad, we're only making ourselves look like idiots. We have to stop upvoting shit just because we like the sound of it. Does it really make sense bigger blocks would handle less transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:12:27
yea i don't think people know what a bubble is.
Actually, I feel like most people here don't know shit about most of this stuff. I've seen a lot of facepalming comments about fiat

@_date: 2018-01-07 23:22:25
yes but many easy-to-use mainstream exchanges don't, so you're going to run into a non-segwit address along the way sadly. We REALLY need to push these places to make the switch
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:46:19
that's the how-to page, if you try and follow those instructions you'll see you can't

i'm sure there's some, don't get me wrong, but if you don't think people who actually care about bitcoin aren't upset about the high fees and long confirmations i don't know what to tell you. Even OPs segwit fee is higher than other top 10 coin fees
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:29:50
Why would lightning change that? If they already weren't using an easy option, why would they start using a more difficult one out of nowhere?
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:56:44
Problem is people suggest them to switch to places like Gemini... who don't use segwit either.
Also the amount of people in this subreddit is minuscule compared to the overall amount of people who use it. 90% of the sub could stop using them and it wouldn't make enough of a difference for them to care
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:14:27
which is still on average 500% more than every other alt coin. Your point?

To be fair he's right, the one stars are an organized brigade and it's a tad childish. We shouldn't have to brigade to convince people we are the better option
i mean the title "wank bags like this &lt;3" in itself is childish and not part of a community i want to be in

Sadly, they're no better
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:32:57
Gemini doesn't use segwit or batching though, so you're not switching to a company that is helping alleviate the issue at hand
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:26:36


that has NOTHING to do with it being a success or not. BCH has been around since August and is at a price that bitcoin took YEARS to reach. The only thing helping btc right now is it being the original, well known coin - not because it's the best coin
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:03:58
one of the most popular websites to buy btc had an outage. as a result, less transactions occured.

who touched you?
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:23:32

Meanwhile bch is fast and cheap NOW. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:09:02

I just sent ether for 14 cents. There. Now i'm not a roger ver shill and I'm still proving to you 2 bucks is too much. People don't like to lose their money, they CAN AND WILL transfer to other means to do so. That opinion shouldn't make me Roger Ver to you
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:14:53
I mean obviously only segwit comments will come up if you search segwit.
You scrolled through what, maybe 10 tweets right there? You really think they don't get many more tweets than that?
I'm all for segwit adoption and want coinbase to get it ASAP, but you have to understand, most of their users probably don't even know segwit is a thing. Plus they have no reason to adopt it yet, there are other things they can focus on that would be more profitable for them. Totally sucks, but crying about it to us doesn't do any good, we all want it too!

@_date: 2018-01-14 00:19:03
Coinbase is spamming the network with legit transactions and bitcoin can't handle it so it's apparently not the technologies fault
don't get me wrong, they can absolutely be more efficient about it (and hopefully they will), but if people are paying the fees for the transactions then they're legitimate transactions and not spam
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:59:24
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:28:04
I think you're unclear on how it works. Coinbase doesn't take on the fees, the user does
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:15:43
this is a great way to make bitcoin a peer-to-peer currency!
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:25:06
yea, people are dumb. Gemini is no different than coinbase, and if they had as many users as coinbase there would be the exact same complaints and nonsense. They also don't batch or use segwit. They are coinbase2.0, yet this sub thinks it's their golden boy 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:24:17
but it's optional. welcome to decentralization my friend
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:13:14
only because it shot up yesterday while the rest of the market was falling. Definitely fishy that they were one of the few going up yesterday
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:12:25
why? they don't need a second layer to be fast and cheap
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:54:59
Binance doesn't use segwit either. Sure we shouldn't use them, but the fact of the matter is we are a TINY percent of the people using these sites, to the point where us switching wouldn't effect them in the slightest. If anything coinbase would probably prefer less usage at the moment as they're so bogged down.
Anyway, my point is, these places need to switch to make a difference, as they are the popular, heavily used exchanges and would make a large difference.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:28:26
how so?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:14:04


yes. the coffee isn't real
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:01:05
why would they do that when they can just point a finger at coinbase and call them the baddies
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:45:08
welcome to decentralization. this is the world you chose my friend
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:05:23
yea believe it or not there's a lot of ins and outs to transferring fiat. and you'll notice a lot of people who have the issues did the same thing, cancelled a wire
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:26:28
pivot to a system that isn't production ready? seems like a shit plan
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:23:33
not to mention intel sat on advancements until AMD came along. And AMD is really starting to give them a run for their money so the next decade will be exciting to see as there's real competition now
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:04:43
You dropped that. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:04:35
that's one of the biggest problems at the moment sadly, it's not exactly the easiest thing for your average joe to do. It's going to have to be streamlined big time
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:55:38
Why? Dude knows what he's talking about, he was one of the few who saw the mortgage collapse coming, and even fewer who saw it coming way in advance

unless lightning gets mass adopted this year, btc won't be able to break new ATHs. Nobody wants to buy something they'll receive in a week for a massive fee, and the mempool will fill if price starts going near the ATH
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:17:48
the point is NOBODY KNOWS. The end of 2018 is a long ways away, lots of shit can happen. Just because the last 3 years went up, doesn't mean the same will happen
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:02:35
You can do it with literally any exchange though, that's kinda the problem when it comes to fiat conversion, it's a bitch
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:00:16
so only if you're important enough to matter? ;)
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:37:36
that doesn't mean it's ready
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:00:51
He didn't present any arguments, he presented pure speculation from numbers moving up and down - something that happens 20 times a day
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:38:12
This kind of behavior is childish and I'm ashamed this shit even reaches the front page. Scam website? Misleading at the most, but scam? Just like all those coinbase transactions are "spam"
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:53:42
this is such a shitty analogy
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:39:55
You wanted a decentralized coin, you got one. There's postive's and negatives to both my friend. You just discovered a negative.
Also, why not accept both? There's no reason not to
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:30:39
This is far from rubber hitting the road. Torguard tweeted they will be eating all losses that occur as it "is not production ready"
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:14:44
Sadly, Gemini is no better than cb
Not sure about Bitflyer though, do they use segwit and batches?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:59:55
Surprise! The people who make these stupid posts don't know shit about shit
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:22:52
Coinbase is by far the most popular place for americans to buy and sell btc. They had an outage, so they fees dropped because the most popular place to transact was no longer transacting.
They can certainly be more efficient with batching and segwit, but saying they are "spamming" the network is absurd, it's not spam - it's actual transactions that have been paid for
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:13:15
holy shit a logical response, didn't know these were possible when talking about coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:11:43
They are no better than coinbase sadly. They also don't use segwit and in the other thread someone said they don't batch either
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:52:26
Signed. Also can we get one for binance? They're even larger than coinbase aren't they?
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:32:26
unreasonable, and by the time you receive that bitcoin, it could be drastically less than the amount you were supposed to receive
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:15:06
Mainnet isn't production ready yet, even Elizabeth Stark is against transferring to mainnet for now.
So no, it's not production ready yet, but people like OP using the testnet are helping to get it there
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:06:06
average joe isn't going to use Lightning Network. It costs money to open and close the channel. I'd imagine your average joe isn't buying stuff with bitcoin, sending it to their wallets, and then cashing it out later
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:51:00
i think it's the same code. so the difficulty would scale just like bitcoin would if they lost all chinese miners. Don't quote me on that though
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:37:04
everything i'm seeing bases it off of 24hours, and since they were down for a few hours wouldn't this skew the numbers?
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:47:16
I thought binance was based out of china as well? Why does just kucoin get the designation? Or am I wrong
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:55:00
ah yes, mythbusters, the kings of doing everything correctly and totally not a tv production made to entertain
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:14:41


Nobody fell for anything. Microsoft DID remove btc payment. Hence this article saying it's back up

This is currently  on @_date: 2018-01-19 20:13:09
but here's the thing, there's not 50% adoption, so it's literally only a pipe dream at the moment. That's the problem with bitcoin right now, too many people focused on the possibilities and not the actual situation
