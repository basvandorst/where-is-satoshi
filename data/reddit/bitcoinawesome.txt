I'm just saying that adding replay protection automatically makes you an Altcoin and not Bitcoin.  Not adding replay protection let's the "best" one win.

Funny how authoritarian Bitcoin users are becoming.

Blockstream says high fees are a good thing. They control core

Yep too bad not enough space for everyone or they would have had my business..  Now waffle house gets it.

High on chain fees makes people move to blockstream products.  This is why they are most vocal about small blocks 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:39:14
They do want fees to be high so people move off chain  to their products.  They have not hidden their thoughts about fees.  Try to keep up

What is the problem with Bitcoin NG.  I see Waves just created its own version of it and and does 1000 tps on chain.  Does core have reasons?

Adding replay protection would be giving up and conceding defeat.  It's actuslly up to the minority chain to protect itself if they think they will lose.

There will never be full "consensus" on anything..
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:40:38
You are upset that you were given a coin worth about $1000 against your will? I'll take it if you dont want it.

As if most Bitcoiners don't

I've walked out of many restaurants because there was a long wait.  This is a dumb argument.

Threating lawsuits if a company doesn't run your version of bitcoin, calling up the SEC, and being buddies with Blankfein now.  lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:45:12
Begging for replay protection from another chain insinuates that you will have the losing chain.   Its up to the minority chain to install replay protection.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:18:51
Lol the market isn't quite done speaking

"why I'm against replay protection" 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:15:14
The jury is still out on whether 2x is the minority or not.  But just giving in and giving replay protection is admitting defeat before the "fight" has even started.  Should you expect every bitcoin hardfork to act in good faith and install replay protection?

Dude Peter is one of the biggest committers and he is the cofounder of blockstream.  A for profit company who needs small blocks to turn a profit.

Apparently all the people that have been in BTC the longest seem to be the most evil and all these newer people seem to have the best intentions in mind?  Maybe tell Tom how bad Eric Vorhees is too since Eric was also on his show.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:18:11
But you are for basing the future of Bitcoin around tech that hasn't been proven or even invented yet.
