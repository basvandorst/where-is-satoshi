This is why the tip bot has so much potential. Reddit already plays such a huge role in the culture. A few well-placed tips (in response to deserving comments or even celebrity AMAs) could go a long way. I would recommend tipping in slightly higher amounts outside of this subreddit, so it doesn't come across as spammy.

I think it's more about the juxtaposition of someone who would both 1. graffiti something like that (in poor English, even), and 2. know about Bitcoin. It becomes kind of funny when you start imagining what kind of person would fit this description, and you start wondering if it's a real person at all, or some kind of creative performance artist. I give it 3 stars.

It could backfire if Reddit starts getting spammed with a bunch of 10 cent tips.

Android game developers: this is your cue.

I have no plans to delete or edit it. My hope is that I can point back to it and say, "I called it!" Either that or look back and see how fantastically wrong I was, and learn from that. **EDIT** and my prediction isn't about Valve per se, but about some company (or group of companies) establishing a universal in-game currency.

I personally like the one on the right, but I would ask a design-oriented subreddit. I don't know anything about aesthetics.

+tip ALL verify
**edit** because Satoshi Forest is one of the coolest ideas I've ever seen.

After I talked to my dad about Bitcoin, his response was "Maybe I should buy some." I quickly said, "No, you probably shouldn't." It's an extremely high-risk, high-reward investment. No one should invest so much that they would regret it if Bitcoin drops to zero.

If Bitcoin's chances of success were considered inevitable, or even 50%, or even 10%, its price would be way, way higher. Ask yourself what the market cap of Bitcoin would be if it became a major world currency. Let's conservatively call it $500B. Its current market cap is ~$1.3B, so that is a 384x return (well, 256x if you take off 1/3 for inflation over the next 5-6 years). I think most people here consider Bitcoin's chances better than 1/256, which means most people here believe now is a good time to buy. But I don't think anyone here believes Bitcoin is a low-risk investment. There is risk in every direction: technological risk (51% attacks, the block size problem mentioned in the video, etc), government risk (Bitcoin can only become so big if it is forced underground), and public perception risk (early adopters getting rich combined with a frequent boom/bust cycle will be sure to turn a lot of people off) are probably the big ones. His role wasn't to inspire confidence, but to express the reality of the situation. He's not a politician. :-)

This post started a train of thought for me, so apologies if I end up rambling. But I think Bitcoin is going to win. There are just too many possible paths leading to mass adoption:
  * This post illustrates one: the fact that you can already buy anything with Bitcoin, because wherever it is not accepted directly, there will be an incentive for middlemen to step in.
  * With a bit of infrastructure (or even well-established patterns), Bitcoin could quickly become the de-facto in-game currency choice for indy developers and, eventually, more well-established developers. If Bitcoin were to become seen as the universal in-game currency, it would be backed by something real: power in the metaverse. Making Bitcoin a universal game currency might be a stepping stone to making it a universal currency. Alternatively, if another crypto-currency beats Bitcoin, it may very well do so by taking this path. Such an alternative might come from Valve, if they have aspirations to rule the world.
  * There are a few large companies out there that could implement the following strategy: collect a large number of BTC, and then announce the acceptance of Bitcoins. Such a company would have to be large enough so that such an announcement would significantly increase BTC's value.

This made me smile, because it's actually not a bad description. But to answer your question: I would start by pointing out that all major world currencies are largely electronic now (there is not a printed paper bill for every dollar in the system; not even close). And then describe Bitcoin as a currency that was "born electronic", but that has no central authority, and no threat of inflation, lower processing costs, and the backing of Silicon Valley. If you want to get into some "next level shit", talk about how it is a peer-to-peer system, and that such systems have historically been a force of nature: capable of changing the world virtually overnight, and tenacious against organizations wishing to stamp them out. Bitcoin is one of the latest in a series of such systems that has included the Internet, Napster, and BitTorrent, all of which have changed the world dramatically.
