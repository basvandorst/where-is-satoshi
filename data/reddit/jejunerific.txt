In the USA, be in the 0% long term capital gains bracket. I.e. retire and have no ordinary income and live off of your long term Bitcoin gains.
Single: $38,600
Married: $77,200
Lots of "retire early" sites go over this plan. Take the hit to pay off any debt (or use existing savings) and live frugally.

The idea is to protect the private key from malware. Also, hw wallets have a pin code and are tamper resistant, so a thief will not be able to steal your bitcoin if they find your hw wallet.
The key thing is that the transaction signing must be done from a secure computer. The private key must not be exposed. This means either a hw wallet or a permanently-offline computer. How can you be _sure_ you don't have malware on your computer? It's a little scary when you are sending a lot of money!
The steps to use a secure device to send a transaction:
* transaction copied to secure device
* user double-checks transaction on secure device
* transaction is signed (requires private key)
* signed transaction is transferred back to potentially-insecure device
* signed transaction is broadcast to the bitcoin network

Existing payment processors are subject to mediation, i.e. censorship, transaction reversals, etc...
I think lightning hubs will be run by payment providers if they can legally get away with it.
Maybe it will be similar to email (a peer-to-peer protocol). If your email server isn't running, you can't receive email! Most people don't run their own email servers, but you can if you want to.

Also possible to use radio links to bridge borders. Miners would have incentive to bodge something together ASAP (they really don't want to be on a losing branch). Relaying Bitcoin transactions doesn't take that much bandwidth.

I meant to say that Nvidia does not have any advantage in making Bitcoin mining ASICs, so they won't do it. They missed the boat and can probably never catch up.
Nvidia doesn't have access to better semiconductor processes than other chip companies. Now, Intel, on the other hand...
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:24:18
Did you know ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit? Nvidia already makes ASICs! Making chips = Making ASICs.
I know you meant "Bitcoin mining ASICs", but I thought I'd point this out just in case you or others don't know the terminology.
Nvidia is all about making hardware to do efficient massively parallel computations, so I am certain they could design an excellent SHA256 miner.
Did you know Nvidia doesn't actually manufacture their own chips? Nvidia contracts with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) to actually manufacture them. There are very few semiconductor fabricating companies ("fabs") in the world, so this arrangement is very common. For example, even AMD does not manufacture its own chips (they spun that part of their business off in 2009). Intel, however, is the world's most advanced production semiconductor fab company.
The SHA256 hash function is simple and other bitcoin ASIC companies have probably already reached almost optimal designs so the biggest competitive advantage in bitcoin ASICs is the semiconductor *process* that it is made with. Nvidia makes very complicated chips that require complex hardware and software designs. Bitcoin mining is not really like that.
Whew... that was quite a diversion.
Have a nice day!

Thanks for clarifying.


That honestly sounds pretty good to me. I thought you might have been making a distinction between private keys and seeds.


I disagree; I've seen wallets tell you to write down seed words and put them somewhere safe. They even make the user confirm back what the seed was. Not so crazy to think a lot of noobs actually do have paper wallets! It doesn't really take any technical skills.


Maybe, but I doubt it. It's just so much more practical and efficient for for hackers to get data electronically. I think this holds true even for offline wallets, where users can be tricked into sharing their seed/key.
Sure some people might be targeted physically, but I doubt many. We should definitely still heed your advice and think hard about the safety of offline wallets. Don't want to become a statistic, as they say :)

I do think it's awesome and we are truly getting updates from space (no quotes needed). But there is no node running in space, just data being beamed up from earth and back down. Space full nodes (or miners!) would be beyond awesome!
I just wanted to clarify just in case some crazy people want to get all worked up (oops I guess I was the only one that got worked up).
And I promise the "LIES" part was supposed to be sarcasm. I'm seeing all these crazy toxic replies (mainly in "the other" sub) where people love to accuse everyone of LYING. It's just so stupid and petty, not leaving room for really complex ideas being hard to describe or the possibility that someone could be genuinely mistaken.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:20:20
LIES! Ahem, oh... sorry got carried away.
Blockstream rented bandwidth on some satellites to send out bitcoin network updates. They did NOT put a node up in a space. In my opinion, a very important distinction.

From 




This is roughly two weeks if hash power doesn't change drastically.
So the proposal outlined by the poster is certainly possible if a large majority of miners stopped at once. Not that I think it is likely.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:07:10
Yes it helps the network to run a full node (pruning or non-pruning). Full nodes validate and relay transactions and blocks (both to and from miners) in a peer-to-peer manner. More full nodes means the network has more capacity and that it is harder to cheat.
The "network capacity" doesn't really help transaction throughput, though; it's more about sharing the current state of the Bitcoin blockchain and raising the confidence that you have the correct up-to-date state. In this way it helps to run a full node if you want to accept low-confirmation transactions or run a Lightning Network node.

It still takes a lot of thought and coordination and you need to get enough people to agree to do it.


And it grows at roughly 144 megabytes per day (when blocks are full). One block every 10 minutes, 1MB max size (non-segwit).
Some scenarios:
* no segwit: 144 MB per day
* no segwit + 2x: 288 MB per day
* segwit enabled but not used: 144 MB per day
* segwit enabled and 100% used: ~288 MB per day
* segwit enabled and 100% used + 2x: ~576 MB per day
With segwit more passengers are let in **and the bus is bigger**. But importantly, for *full nodes with pruning enabled*, some of the passengers can be thrown off the bus when they get to their destination.
Full nodes secure and validate all the consensus rules of Bitcoin transactions; mainly they need to keep track of the Unspect Transaction Output (UTXO) set. The signature data in segwit transactions does not add to the UTXO size and can be discarded.
A straight-up block size increase requires all full nodes to use more storage. With segwit, only archival nodes use more storage. Some subset of nodes need to be archival nodes (so new nodes can get synced and know the entire history of bitcoin is valid), but for securing the network they are not that important.
The important things to remember about segwit:
* If most transactions become segwit transactions, transactions per block can roughly double
* Incentive to minimize UTXO growth (full nodes with pruning do not need more storage even with more transactions per block)
* Fixes bugs in old transaction format
* Backwards compatible with old Bitcoin nodes (unlike a "simple" block size increase). An old wallet will think segwit transactions are "anyone can spend" transactions (but you will not be able to spend it). It will otherwise work perfectly fine.

Better to use dd_rescue, which can skip/retry bad blocks and resume. Otherwise good advice!

You've got the right idea, but I have to nitpick - DNS generally runs on UDP or TCP.
DNS was pretty much the original distributed (but not decentralized) service on the internet. Bitcoin and DNS are definitely bros. Yay!
The other common protocol built on top of IP (other than TCP and UDP) is ICMP, but there are still quite a few other lesser known protocols in use.

Bitcoin is a trust-less currency. It inherently "subverts" the notion of controlling a currency.
Bitcoin solves the problem of completely non-reversible transactions performed over a communications channel. See paragraph 1 of 
The motivation for solving this problem is ultimately to make transactions cheaper (in other words, allow micro-payments). The transactions can be cheaper because there is no mediation overhead.
It doesn't really allow anyone to "subvert the government" other than the value is not controlled by a government, but that is not a property unique to Bitcoin. Think about precious metals, art, etc...
