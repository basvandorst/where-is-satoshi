Yup with the Coinbase app on a tablet they're also using for the Square app.

We're having our third monthly meeting this Monday (Jan 6) at a new location: Sabor Y Cultura Cafe, 5625 Hollywood Boulevard
The manager at Sabor Y Cultura was very friendly and looking forward to hosting us. 
Everyone welcome, come on out and meet your fellow Bitcoiners.

Hi! I'm the guy who helped get Sabor y Cultura setup to accept Bitcoin :-). More info here:

Good question.  Do you know a better app that makes tipping easier?  When I paid with my Android Wallet app I was able to add more than the bill requested but that doesn't necessarily make it easy for them to determine which part is for the bill and which is for tips.

I just dropped off this sticker at the cafe and the manager said she'd be happy to put it up.  If anyone sees it please let me know!

Sabor is using the Coinbase point-of-sale app.  So you'll need a phone wallet that can scan a bar code.  I use the Android Bitcoin Wallet app (from Google Play store) and it works great.

Our fourth monthly meeting is next Monday.  The cafe we've having it at is very close to being setup to accept bitcoin!

Thanks for the suggestion. done!

The arbiters are free to design arbitration agreements with traders as needed to best resolve disputes for the payment methods they are arbitrating. For instance a US wire transfer arbiter could require each traders to join the arbiter in a 3 way conference call with their respective banks (initiated by the arbiter to verify the right number is called), where the participants must get their banks to verbally verify a transfer was sent or received or not.  So in other words to go call up the banks and verity the transfer.  This of course exposes the traders bank information to the arbiter so they must be trusted, but is only needed in case of potential fraud and never exposes private information between traders.

I sent the manager the link and let her know. Thanks

I made a small contribution to the XT linux RPM installer and Mike was nothing but supportive and the feedback I got from him and the rest of the XT team was nothing but constructive.  Bottom line a pleasure to work with and a big loss to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

:-) We like all non-custodial btc exchange projects, but yes you have correctly identified some of our key goals. In particular for point 3 we are building our app to support Android 5 devices, which we've been told are common in poorer countries like Venezuela. According to Google Android 5 and above will get us \~90% of Android phone users. [
In other news, I just finished adding message signing, and should have the p2p encryption for trade data ready to roll out to our beta users next week. Not only are we making it so that the trade data is unreadable on our servers, but we're also obfuscating which trade messages go with which offer to make it harder to infer an offer makers trade volume.

Hi, I'm on the Bytabit team and yes the Hodlhodl project is great, especially that they are a non-KYC exchange. We like everything they are doing and wish more exchanges would follow their direction. But we also think there's room for improvement and by offering our service via a full mobile app we can improve usability and privacy.
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:12:20
That's a good suggestion. We will do a video walk through showing the trade process for buyers and sellers and the arbitration process. Keep in mind that the app is currently testnet only beta but all primary use cases are ready to use on testnet.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:42:52
Some more info on the Bytabit app here:

Thanks for the feedback! 
For 1-3 I'll make sure we have some place-holder stories on our backlog for these. We're currently focusing on the core features we need to be ready for mainnet and less on UI improvements right now. In particular we need to 1) finish adding end-to-end message signing and encryption, and 2) replacing our current SPV wallet with something better (probably will switch to Samurai dojo full node API) . The key is we as the intermediary don't want to have access to any trade or bitcoin transaction details.
For 4 before we go to mainnet we will  put together some proper user documentation including some video tutorials and we'll link to that from the app.  Right now the 'help' menu in the app only links you to our telegram channel so we can directly talk to potential users and see what they don't like or isn't working.
Regarding the badges, we plan to use that as a way for users to buy a "offer maker" subscription that allows them to post as many offers in a particular currency as they want for a  fixed amount of time, currently we're thinking a year, but could also be less. We won't (and can't) charge a per-transaction fee because we can not see any trade details (traded amount, counter party id, etc.) unless we have to arbitrate.  We intend for badges as a way to pay for our service, and also as a form of reputation, since it will be visible to everyone who has payed for a badge and for how long they've been a "member in good standing", meaning no fraud identified during any arbitration.
For 6, do you mean he payment reference? this is meant to be a place for the person sending fiat to record what ever transaction id is associated with the payment method they use.  This is meant to help btc sellers to help correlate payments to the right trade.  But I do see your point and will think about if there's some better way to do this.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:45:11
Thanks, and yes this is on our priority list prior to going to mainnet.
@_date: 2013-10-15 05:44:54
haha, I didn't see that skit.  But the route is really a reasonable way to go.

Took me over an hour to get to Santa Monica for the LA Bitcoin meetup last week.. so ya LA is a big place..

We're on for our first meeting tomorrow night at Caffe Vita at Sunset and Hollywood Blvd. More info here:

Great idea and implementation goshakkk! For those having trouble getting their heads around multisig transactions and how to use them for escrows here is a little presentation I gave at the Bitcoin conference last month in Amsterdam, I hope it helps:

Finding some local venues willing to accept Bitcoins is high on my to-do list.  I recently met the bar owner of Room 77 in Berlin who started the Bitcoin Kiez there and he was very inspiring.
@_date: 2013-10-21 02:08:01
It looks like he is using a multisig output address for the TX that funds the escrow:

I think you'll need to get Satoshi to host his own TV show or appear in a major motion picture first ;-)

Just saw this from June.  I hope Garcetti has more in mind than the typical crony capitalism usually touted.

Darn! I was looking for a meetup sub-group but didn't see it listed under the related communities.. hopefully it's OK to repost there too. Thanks

Just a reminder we're having our first Hollywood Bitcoin meetup next Monday @ 7 at Caffe Vita on Sunset.  Everyone welcome!

I was actually coming from Burbank last week.. but even from Hollywood and on surface streets I don't expect it would have been an easy drive.
