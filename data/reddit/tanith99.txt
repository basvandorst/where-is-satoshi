Current price is largely supported by speculation on future use of Bitcoin. But hearing today that the adoption will be cut off at current levels, I don't see how speculation will increase.

Not raising the block size results in even more unsafe conditions than raising it. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 20:57:58
It sure isn't, and anyone pretending like they can use it as an excuse for not raising the blocksize is being dishonest.

I know how to read, and a year is a long time.
Maybe you should try reading this, he's been around a little longer than I have.
Edit: I went to my history to check wtf you were referring to. I wonder how many people here could answer that question today. But working to educate myself on technical terms to further a low-level understanding of Bitcoin somehow disqualifies me in your eyes? Seriously?

Big paradigm shifts take time. Bitcoin is taking off, you just need a little perspective.

Break more windows, problem solved, amirite?

If you truly think most people have a average buyin of over 600,you are delusional. But I suspect you are being less than honest. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:14:10
You can, at Newegg! 
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:54:36
No, but I keep seeing people recommending libertyx.com as a way to buy with cash. You may want to check that out if you are out of other options. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 06:22:33
Come at me, sirs. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:06:04
I can't believe it. Newegg was big, this is mind-blowing. I am stunned. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:05:55
I've seen people pull money out of their underwear at the checkout line like it's no big deal. Ugh.
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:19:37
This is actually good news. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:13:15
You are incredibly naive. Read deepcapture.com some time.

Hemp oil soap.  So great!

But Porsche only sells to dealers,  right? So they would accept Bitcoin from dealers?
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:40:46
I thought you could? Wasn't it bitwage? One of those companies lets you use direct deposit, which can specify a portion of for bitcoin. Sorry for my bad memory, I am sure someone else here remembers.

Wait, since when does gambling with cryptocurrency break any laws? 
@_date: 2014-12-11 06:39:26
Suck it, haters! 
@_date: 2014-12-11 07:26:11
They didn't sound very smart, but maybe they will wise the fuck up when they realize how foolish they look. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:37:54
Sorry if this is a newb question, what do you mean by "certain chainstates?"
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:48:03
Boom,  excellent point. 
@_date: 2015-09-28 04:35:05
Doubtful.  Details on the entries and  information  made it likely  this already ridiculous sounding part if the "evidence" was fabricated. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:54:21
Yep,  and in there because xt was already attacked.

China is leading the pack and has been for a month or so. Gemini just lacks liquidity.
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:42:37
Lol well. They don't verify it, so... 
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:33:12
They also  judge laws.
