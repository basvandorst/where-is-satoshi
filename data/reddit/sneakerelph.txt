I think at some point it's going to start to be an automatic feature of wallets and exchanges. With [Channel Factories]( being handled behind the scenes as well in the further future, we'll be in a world where on-chain transactions don't really need to happen, except in cases of dispute. Otherwise, as long as people aren't being bad actors (and there's plenty of incentive to play by the rules), on-chain transactions won't even be necessary. All the while requiring no trust from any parties. It's awesome, even if it's complex behind the scenes.

Starbucks doesn't need to have a channel with every customer. They'd be more likely to use a payment processor like Bitpay, which would be well connected on the lightning network. As long as the customer has a channel open with someone who's connected to that payment processor (either directly or through multiple hops on the network), they can buy coffee for as long as they have money in the channel. They can use the channel for more than just coffee. They can use it to buy stuff at any other merchant who is somehow connected through them.
You won't be prepaying for your coffee for the year, you'll be prepaying your LN transactions in that channel for a year. A channel can be used with more than one merchant, as long as they're connected on the network.

There’s no way for amazon to abuse it, but there is some centralization risk. If amazon goes down, you’ll have to unilaterally close your channel with them, but they can’t steal your money. Only cause a disruption in connectivity on the network. They can’t go down and take all the money with them. 
Similar to the internet. If a large backbone ISP goes down, it makes connecting difficult, but the protocol is designed to route around areas of failure. 
Hopefully the network will be robust enough to withstand attacks on larger hubs, but at the start there will probably be growing pains around this.

If an older transaction is broadcast and there's a newer one to replace it (either because your node was keeping an eye on it or other nodes were keeping an eye on it for a cut of the penalty) then the channel closes and you get all the funds that were in the channel as a penalty.
So there's pretty strong incentive for folks to _not_ try to cheat the system, since there's a very low likelihood of success and the penalties for doing so are very high.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:57:19
Yeah, you basically just need to send your coins to the sidechain to be able to use them there.
My question about side chains: Don't they eventually run into the scaling problems bitcoin does, if they get big enough? Or is the idea to be able to implement on-chain scaling solutions on these sidechains in a way that doesn't affect the main network? Then many sidechains can compete for the most efficient/usable solution, while not competing against bitcoin directly.
I need to look into sidechains a bit more I think.

You probably wouldn’t open a channel with steam. You’d open a channel with a well connected node on the network and pay for all lightning purchases that way. You “lock up” funds you want to use on the lightning network, similar to how you “lock up” funds in a checking account to use on a debit/checking network. 
So if you did open a channel directly with steam, you’d most likely be using it for more than just purchases from steam.

I think this solution addresses this - I haven’t had a chance to think to deeply about it yet so I’m not sure how scalable it is.
It’s also possible that we just accept that paychecks are going to be on-chain transactions, but all the other stuff doesn’t have to be. I have faith this kind of stuff will be well-automated as this tech matures. Lots of stuff can be done off chain, but some things will still have to be done on-chain and that’s okay. We’ll still need a blocksize increase if that’s the case, but we can substantially reduce the amount of transactions that need to be on-chain. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:11:34
Here’s a look at how this could potentially be solved: 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:17:07
You won't open channels for single transactions, that would be very inefficient. You'll open a channel with a well-connected nodes, and the store will also have a channel open with a well-connected node (maybe the same one, probably a different one). As long as there's a path of channels connecting you to the store, you'll be able to buy stuff.
You won't need to close the channel unless there's some dispute or you need those funds freed up for a blockchain transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:16:07
It's not in the whitepaper (not 100% sure why, maybe it's lower level than the whitepaper covers?)
This is the code they use to route transactions. Nodes only know the node that sent them the transaction, and the node they're supposed to send the transaction to. It works the same way The Onion Router (TOR) works. I'm not sure if this is currently implemented in the alphas you can run on testnet.
EDIT: according to their github, LND currently does implement onion routing.

However much you commit to the channel. At first, people will probably only put small amounts, but as the network gains traction and (hopefully) proves itself to be stable and useful, there won't be much reason to keep funds on-chain. It's important to remember that you aren't risking the funds in a channel - you can close the channel at any time and get those funds back, even if the person you have the channel open with doesn't agree to closing the channel (closing in this way takes time, if you both agree to close a channel then you need only wait until it's in the blockchain). You don't have to trust them to hold your funds.

@_date: 2017-12-27 21:26:54
Yeah, this is probably an actual worry. Hopefully Lightning will be widespread enough that on-chain transactions aren't so clogged (and a blocksize increase would probably help here), but there is a potential world where bad actors watch for clogged times and pull their shenanigans then.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:45:00
The funds in the channel are the funds available for you to use within that channel. If you and I both put up 1 btc in a channel, then both of us can send any amount to the other up to that amount. Back and forth, as many times as we want. The only transactions that hit the blockchain is the one where we open the channel, and when we close the channel.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:19:00
It’s not up to them, it’s up to users and service providers to implement it. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:12:25
Good point, I hadn’t thought that if the block congestion is a problem for you, it’s an even riskier problem for the attacker. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:37:48
I guess that’s one way to look at it!
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:42:49
I think in the future where everyone is using bitcoin, almost all bitcoin is committed to channels. End users won't be making these channels (unless they're a power user and want the control and lack of required trust), they'll just keep their coin with some service provider like they do with a bank now.
If that doesn't sound good to you, you can run your own lightning node and commit all your funds to a channel with a well-connected node, and trust only yourself with the upkeep of your node. Assuming you can reach any other node through your well connected node, there's no real benefit to having your coin outside of a channel, except security concerns around having your private keys on an internet-connected device. So, you commit any funds you think you may want to use in the near future, and maybe keep your deep savings outside of a channel. The blockchain will probably be used less and less as Lightning becomes ubiquitous. Transactions never need to hit the blockchain unless there's a dispute over channel states, and at that point they'll be the aggregate of many, many transactions between you and the node you have a channel open with.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:47:43
Actually, as long as the channel you open has some sort of connection to the node that tshirt guy runs (doesn't have to be direct, it can go through any number of other nodes), the node that denied you a channel actually can't tell that a payment is coming from you, and thus they can't block it. Unless they're blocking all payments to tshirt guy, in which case he'd probably be better off closing his channel and opening with someone who won't deny him payments.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:23:18
You’ll likely have an open channel with a well connected hub, like an exchange or other provider (whomever you like) and they’ll also have a channel open with another well connected hub. As long as there’s a path from your hub to their hub you’ll be good (and it doesn’t have to be directly from your hub to their hub, just as long as there’s a path of hubs between).
You could argue that this leads to centralization, but it is trustless, since you don’t have to trust the hubs you interact with. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:24:49
This is true.
In reality, I think people will centralize around known trusted nodes. Exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and Bitstamp will probably be well connected nodes (at least at the start, more will arrive as the need arises), and if you want an easier experience you'll have to trust them to hold your funds and deal with all the lightning stuff for you. If you don't trust them, you can create your own channel with them using your own node, but that comes with the upkeep of keeping your node running and accessible.
But if you control your own channel to them and accept the extra work running a node is (i'm not sure if it is much - can you receive payments while your node is offline?), you don't have to trust anybody.
Honestly, for this stuff to really work in the real world, most people will just trust a service provider like Coinbase to handle this stuff for them, the same way folks trust banks today. I know the whole point of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust anybody, but for regular folks they won't mind having the option to give up some trust and control in exchange for ease-of-use.
The risk in centralization comes from if only a few large nodes crop up, and then one of them is taken offline through DDOS or government intervention or something like that. The Internet is constructed similarly and if that situation arises, it would definitely be a disruption of service, but no funds would be lost. I think lots of nodes will crop up to fill the place of a behemoth being taken down, similar to when MT Gox went down and we got a whole slew of great exchanges in its place. Only starting a lightning node is much easier than starting a whole exchange!
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:21:33
The only way someone would be able to take funds in a channel is if they published an older state of the channel than what you have - if your lightning node is watching for this, you can publish the newer version of the transaction with the actual channel state (cryptographically proven to be a newer, agreed-upon state) and then close the channel. Doing it this way also grants all funds in the channel to the person providing the newer transaction, creating a pretty big incentive for a potential fraudster to just be honest.

If you have armory set up as an offline wallet, what you'll do in Armory on that computer is make a "watching only" wallet that you'll use with Armory on your online machine. That wallet can't spend money, but it will create a file that you take to your offline machine to get signed. Then you take the signed file back to your online machine and it broadcasts the transaction. So basically you have to get permission from the offline computer before you can spend your money. Also makes it harder to panic sell during a price fall because of all the steps required just to spend your coins.

1. There are more possible addresses than there are atoms in the universe, so the odds of this are near impossible.
2. The address becomes part of the blockchain when money is sent to it. So addresses that have never been used are not part of the blockchain. If they've ever had money in them (even if they don't anymore), then they are part of the blockchain.

1 confirmation means it's in the blockchain, more than that is just further entrenching it in the blockchain.
As long as you're not nefarious and trying to double spend your coins, you can be certain your transaction will be recorded in the blockchain, unless it doesn't include a miner's fee. Then you might have to wait longer.
It's the merchant who may want to wait for confirmations, but honestly, for such small amounts like a sandwich, a double spend would be more trouble than it's worth. As long as the merchant doesn't detect a double spend within a few minutes (probably seconds, somebody else may be able to back me up here), then the transaction has made its way around the network enough that you wouldn't be able to get a double spend done, since the network will ignore a double spend.

The actual problem is a hashing algorithm. SHA-256, in bitcoin's case.
What's a hashing algorithm? A hashing algorithm takes some kind of input. Anything, really. A sentence, a word, or an entire bitcoin block. It generates a fixed-length outcome (called a hash) on the other end. For example, the hash word "bitcoin" is 6b88c087247aa2f07ee1c5956b8e1a9f4c7f892a70e324f1bb3d161e05ca107b
What's great about hashes is that changing even one bit of the input completely changes the hash that comes out on the other end. so the hash for "Bitcoin" (note the capital B) is b4056df6691f8dc72e56302ddad345d65fead3ead9299609a826e2344eb63aa4
The other great thing about hashes is that, given an output, there is absolutely no way to know what the input was to generate that output. Whether the input is 1 bit or 1TB, you'll get a hash of the same length 256 bits long, the case of SHA-256.
So with bitcoin, what miners do is they bundle up the transactions in the block, and add the header information the previous poster was talking about. The date, the hash of the previous block, and some other stuff. There's actually a section for random data in there, called a nonce. Then the miner looks at what the current difficulty level is (which is adjusted about every two weeks, give or take, based on how fast blocks are mined), and then hashes the block it just built over and over, changing only the nonce in order to find a hash that meets the difficulty requirements. The hash has to be below a certain number, so you'll see hashes on recent blocks with a bunch of 0's in front of them (the current block at the time of this writing has a hash of 0000000000000000018f82e14eba6711154c16fc259a0e2861f9bdcfb7d03b30)
The genius part that ensures that every block builds on top of each other, is the fact that the miner includes the previous block's hash in the header information in the block it just created. And since changing even a single bit in a block results in a hash that's completely different, you can't forge older blocks, since changing anything in an older block changes the hash, which in turn changes the hash of EVERY block that comes after it.
The other important thing to know about hashes is that they're actually very easy to calculate. So given a block's information and the hash it's supposed to have, you can very easily verify that block's hash yourself without having to do ALL the work of finding that hash yourself. This is what happens when you first download the bitcoin application and download the entire blockchain. Most people don't do that these days, I think the blockchain itself is over 100GB at this point.
I think that about covers it. I dont' know the specifics of the math behind hashing or anything like that, but I think I have a decent grasp on how the system works from a conceptual level. If you have any other questions feel free to ask!

I imagine a future where wallet files aren't actually kept on everyone's computer or USB drive, much like how people don't keep their life savings inside their mattress. There will be banking corporations that will build banks off of bitcoins, much like how banks are built off of dollars today. Banks won't be held accountable by governments, but by their reputation.
Tech companies like Google will offer their wallet services, and when you want to receive a payment you just request an address from them, and they keep track of everything while you send and receive like cash. Like a debit card for bitcoins.
So, yes, malware will be written to steal wallet files, just like people get their houses broken into (depending on how they secure it of course) and get their cash stolen. Not much will be in wallet files on individual computers, though. It'll all be stored in BitBanks.

But if you decided to spend $10 on that pizza instead you've lost that purchasing power as well, because you could have put it into bitcoin instead. It doesn't make a difference whether you buy the pizza in bitcoin or in USD. If you have USD that you for some reason absolutely cannot convert to bitcoin but you can spend on pizza, it's probably a better idea to spend the cash. But putting all your money into bitcoin and then spending it isn't a bad idea (as long as the value continues rising, of course) because then all of your money is appreciating in value instead of just some of it.

I imagine eventually the price would be somewhat stable enough that goods can be priced statically, without needing to be changed all the time depending on the whims of the market. At that point, if adoption is widespread, you'll just "know" how much 1btc is worth, similar to how you "know" roughly what you can get for a dollar now. At that point, people don't need to convert to fiat, they can just do the same mental math that they do now for current currencies.

Transactions usually show up on the network instantly. I feel like "confirmations" is a little bit of a misnomer, as it implies that until something has been "confirmed" then it's completely up in the air. The reality is that a double spend attack isn't something that's easy to do. As long as Subway has decent connections to nodes (and as a merchant they should) then any double spend attempts will be detected even without a confirmation, and rejected by the network, leaving only the original transaction being valid.
For a 5 dollar footlong, there's a lot of work involved to double spend your coins. I think Subway is safe accepting the transaction once it's out on the network.

If I had to take a guess, I'd say it's a firmware update (maybe with an extra heatsink attached). But if you get a 5gh miner and just upgrade to 7, it may not work correctly. I'm assuming their ASICS have different yields, just like a CPU or GPU, and the ones that don't perform get limited so that they don't fail. If you're lucky, you may get a miner that's rated at 5gh but can run 7 no problem, but I imagine that a lot of the 5gh units simply won't be able to hash at 7gh, especially in these early runs. Like a software unlock that you can get for some graphics cards. Sure, you might be able to squeeze more out of it, but nothing can be guaranteed, unless you get a unit rated at 7gh by BFL.

I tend to agree with you there, but there's significant risk involved with ASICMiner compared to a traditional stock. Still, I think even with the risk involved it's still undervalued.

When it first launched the amount of BTC you could earn just by CPU mining overnight for a few nights would be enough to make you rich now.
Gotta remember that those bitcoins could also have been worthless by now too. It's always a gamble. Still is.

It's less like printing money and more like distributing the money slowly in proportion to how much you help the network. If you've got more power helping process transactions, you get paid more bitcoins. This provides incentive to keep the network going without needing a central authority to hand out coins. 
@_date: 2013-03-10 20:17:28
If you mined a block offline (leaving out that every new block is based on the ones before it, so you can't really do it offline) you'd have your very own block, with as many coins given to yourself as you so desire. But if that block never gets into the network, nobody else will recognize it. You'd have your own fork of the block chain and your new coins would be about as valuable as Schrutebucks or Stanley Nickels. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 08:13:05
It is arbitrary, in that it slows down block generation. Otherwise every single client on the network would be broadcasting its own block as being the next valid block, and nobody would have any reason to use anybody else's block.
So a system has been agreed upon that only blocks with a hash below a certain value are accepted as part of the blockchain. That's why the difficulty adjusts every so often, so that as more computing power gets added to the network, we can roughly assume that a block will only get solved every 10 minutes or so. It's why getting into the mining game now is not nearly as profitable as it was a year or two ago, unless you've got some serious hashing power.
It's arbitrary, but since we all agree upon it, it works.

Most people's deposits are available within half an hour, so if that's instant enough for you the 4% fee may not be so bad.

This is currently more profitable than mining BTC straight up, according to coinotron.com.

Could be retired and living the good life if I'd invested my graduation money in ASICminer a year ago. 
Or, you know, I could have nothing.

Then you should definitely wait before using it. It's a full on gamble right now with a large payout if successful. Nobody is saying "use bitcoin and only bitcoin from now on," they're just highlighting how the reasons you're not getting into it potentially have solutions. The bitcoin community and economy is always evolving and early adopters may be rewarded for their risk. 
If you're not willing to take the risk then don't.

It's not about getting accepted as a merchant, anybody can do that with a Square reader and an iPhone. The problem with buying bitcoins is that doing one large transaction and then charging back is really easy. Yes, it happens at supermarkets too, but given the monetary nature of bitcoin and it's untraceability, nobody can really prove that you got your coins. So it'd be easy to do $500 into an exchange, buy coins, withdraw coins, chargeback the merchant, and nobody can do much about it. Credit card companies almost always side with the consumer in this instance. Meanwhile, you've got your coins AND your money, and you can just open a new account on the same exchange or take those coins to another exchange very very easily. Rinse, repeat. Or just pocket your free $500.

My worry is that Steam will bring the banhammer down on this site. If I'm not mistaken, this violates the TOS of Steam. I'd be worried about my account if Steam were to do something about this site, when they ban things like this they tend to ban the accounts involved too, and it's a huge mess to get sorted out with their support.

Hopefully there's something to be learned from this and it can be kept from happening in the future. But yeah, happening right now is probably good thing.

You'll need to give the address to whichever exchange you buy your bitcoins from so that the coins can be deposited to that address. There isn't a way to get coins into an address that isn't made public somewhere, but nobody will know it's your address except for the person/exchange you buy from.

They run about $275 on BFLs website. This person pre-ordered last year and probably got in when they were still $150. Great deal, but if you order one now you probably won't see it for several months. They've really only just begun shipping items from a year ago, when they were supposed to ship late last summer.
Just some things to consider before placing an order.

As far as I know, just from what I've read online, it really does seem like ASICMiner can keep up their hashing power. They've already sold a lot of older hardware that they have no use for anymore (which also gets factored into the dividends), and they've got a lot that's sitting ready to be deployed. They're pretty far ahead of the game vs other companies. I think I read that their goal is to maintain 30% of the network hashing rate, and it really doesn't look like they'll have much trouble doing that for the foreseeable future.

Is the Cydia one more up to date than the Appstore one? I'd imagine they're trying to limit their updates to the appstore version to keep flying under Apple's radar, but the cydia one could be updated with no issues.

But ebay knows how much the listing ended up selling for, and sends you a bill for their percentage. You won't pay the percentage in bitcoin, but you will pay ebay or they'll cut you off.

The nice thing is, if you dislike that, nothing keeps you from storing your btc on paper wallets in your mattress. The beauty is that you have the freedom from centralization, not the lack of it. Those who'd rather have the extra security won't mind paying  the fees that go along with it.

You can use the test network.
Will get you some coins to use on the testnet. It's an entirely separate network, so what happens there doesn't affect the regular bitcoin network. That way you can test and not actually lose any bitcoin that you're transferring.

Dogecoin is just as great as bitcoin, technologically speaking. The reason bitcoin is worth more is because there are fewer of them, and (most importantly) there's a much larger network of people using and accepting bitcoin. If dogecoin's mining network and merchant network were to grow as large as bitcoin's, it would be just as useful.
Defend dollars vs Stanley Nickels in a way that doesn't invalidate both. Have fun. 
Dollars are better because people use them more than Stanley Nickels, same as bitcoin being more useful than dogecoin because more people use them.

Why would Bitcoin be treated any differently than Paypal? I suppose putting the option in to purchase bitcoin might go against their TOS, but I can already send money to people using the Paypal app on my iPhone, and I don't believe Apple takes a cut of that.

Legitimate users would still need to keep their books for the government. The same thing in place that keeps all employers from just paying their employees cash to avoid taxes. Employers need to keep track of how much they pay their workers for tax purposes. Plus sales tax on other sales. The government could still very much tax bitcoin.

Not for paper wallets. You don't want those keys to have ever come near a network, ideally. That makes it ~~hard~~ impossible for someone to steal your money unless they physically have access to these printings.

I invested in ASICMiner, getting dividends weekly. If the share price skyrockets, awesome, I can sell mine at a profit (they're already well above what I paid for them). If BTC price skyrockets, even better, since I'll be getting more spending power every week with the dividends.

$1.97 may not sound like a lot now, but remember, this is $1.97 in BTC. In a year, how much will that 1.97 be worth? double? triple? half? Who knows. 
Remember to take into account the future when pricing out the profits of mining.
I mean, I did Coinworker a year ago thinking I wasnt' getting anything at around .01BTC per thing of work. It wasn't much then, but I have 5.44 BTC now that I mostly earned from that, and it's not doing so bad!

At this time, a share is ~2.5btc on btct.co.
It costs more, but you don't have to maintain a mining rig, and share prices have the ability to go up, while you'll never be able to recoup the cost of the graphics cards simply by selling them.
It's riskier than a mining rig, but it's less work and has a much higher potential payout, seeing as ASICMiner is keeping up their hashrate, hopefully meaning they can crank out dividends like this (or even a bit lower would be okay) years down the line, while your graphics cards will not mine .026/day forever. That and selling the shares at a profit.
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:50:19
You are correct. I was speaking as if bitcoin were the defacto currency (everyone gets paid in bitcoin, everything is priced in bitcoin) if that were the case, then you'd be buying food in btc.

I don't think we should redefine what we refer to a bitcoin as. That could create the illusion of a crash perhaps. But I am in favor of having things denominated in mBTC. I don't want my 9 bitcoins to turn into 9000, but I wouldn't mind if blockchain.info started displaying my balance as 9000 mBTC, because, lets face it, I don't want to buy a cheeseburger for .001 bitcoins, but I might buy one for 1 mBTC. Lots of 0's can get confusing to the average person, and I'm all in favor of making things less confusing.
Edit because I confused myself with decimals.  
@_date: 2013-06-17 07:19:22
Is there a system built into the protocol for paying transaction fees from another address, maybe? I'm thinking that maybe merchant could pay the transaction fee. They could set what kind of fee they're willing to pay (the incentive for higher fees would be faster inclusion in the blockchain). I'm not familiar enough with the structure of a bitcoin transaction to know if that's possible, but that would be an interesting way to do it. If the merchant doesn't want to pay transaction fees then they'd just have to be willing to take the risk that it won't confirm for awhile.
@_date: 2013-04-28 07:05:55
I think you've got the wrong impression here, right now. Mining bitcoin isn't free money. You can invest in mining hardware that will easily run you a few hundred (or thousand) bucks, but it only gets harder and harder as more people enter. Mining for profit now is really something best left to those with the ability to get gigahashes going.
The best thing to do if you're in this to make money (which is the wrong reason to be in it) is to buy some bitcoin and hold until the price goes up and sell it, if you think the price is going to go up.
If this were a money printing system then we'd all be printing money and none of it would be worth anything.

It's something that's unique to the client, not a problem with bitcoin itself. Hopefully the standard client will quit doing this. Is there an advantage to sending to change addresses instead of just back to the original address? I can't think of any and all it seems to do is cause confusion.
