I would say the beginning of stage 3. We will get to see the new peak in time.
As the price decline once again, stage 4 begins.

All in Bitcoin is an exaggeration IMO. But those without a portion of BTC in their portfolio is about to get straight up cucked.

Not even one hodler got a single reason for concern. There’s ebb and flow, but this cruise ships clear destination is not in any way affected. 
Slow and steady, patience is key. It’s in moments like this people actually lose money. Don’t be that one.

1. There is a shitload of other cryptocurrencies in existence and new ones created every day.
2. Bitcoin is split into Satoshis. One BTC = 100 000 000 Satoshis. Today that would be 0.0001 USD for one Satoshi. 
If Satoshis gets very expensive one day, nothing stops people from using another not as valuable cryptocurrency for their smaller transactions.
How could a ”new” Bitcoin arrive? Why Bitcoin stands out is cause it’s the first crypto, that’s why people have adopted it en masse. It rides on that advantage still.

Its not like there is a test for race and gender when it comes to setting up a wallet and buy crypto. 
People that want to buy crypto will buy crypt and vice versa. You are wasting your time trying to impose this.

I think adding a crypto part to a portfolio is not a stupid thing to do.
