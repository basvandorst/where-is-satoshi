I would have to wager that the percentage of criminals that use the US Dollar far outweighs the percentage that use Bitcoin, or have even heard of Bitcoin.

From the press release I think they are based in Denver Colorado, USA. I wonder if they have a physical location there where you can trade fiat for crypto.

Virtual Wallet is a free Checking/Interest Bearing Checking/Savings account (actually three accounts linked together) that PNC provides it's customers, not a virtual currency or even a virtual currency storage.

This sounds like a pretty nice setup. Who do you bank with?

I'm pointing out that your answer implies my answer is irrelevant.

That's not what I said. "the percentage of criminals that use the US Dollar", i.e. take all the criminals and find out what currency they use, my bet would be that the percentage that use the US Dollar is larger than the percentage that use Bitcoin. I never said anything about the number of criminals who use US Dollars vs the number of criminals who use Bitcoin.

Why would my thoughts be irrelevant? You have no actual statistics in your reply to my comment, you simply rephrase my statement into a question- presenting no new information to the argument, while attempting to twist my words. I say 'percentage of people' and you read 'number of people'. 
I'll try to see your side, rephrasing your question so I can better understand what it is you are asking: What percentage of all Bitcoin transactions are done by criminals? and What percentage of all US Dollar transactions are done by criminals?
What I was saying originally (in the form of a rhetorical) is this: What is the percentage of all criminals that use the US Dollar? and What is the percentage of all criminals that use Bitcoin? Obviously, US Dollar would be a higher percentage and my reply was aimed at "bitcoin is the preferred currency of actual criminals".

From what I'm gathering from around, if you can even get money to a Mt. Gox account, you can't get your BTC out.
