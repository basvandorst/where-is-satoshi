Insider trading only exists in equities kiddo. It doesn't even make sense to use that word outside of stocks. Too many noobs just repeat the same buzzwords without even knowing what they mean, it's like they can't even think for themselves anymore. This sub has deteriorated so much in the last five years its shocking.

Investing in funds or individual stocks or crypto isn't trading, investing isn't necessarily zero sum. Futures is trading, it's pure speculation unless your hedging. If someone is trading futures then they best be a professional speculator because trading is a zero sum game. Same applies for Forex and options.

Just ask yourself what works better as a currency. BCH has the same network and pow as BTC, but I get instant 0.01$ transactions because of the change in blocksize. Bitcoin, if your lucky, has $30 fee plus you have to wait up to days for a transaction.
Ask yourself why would the core devs let the network get congested like this, why not fix the problem today, even if temporarily to let the network breath, instead of "promising" a lightning network solution in 18 months. It makes a lot more sense when you realize that the core devs literally work for blockstream, the company developing lightning, this is an obvious conflict of interest as blockstream stands to make a lot of money for them selves from lightning network.
This is the case of poison the village and then profit from selling them the antidote. I will probably get banned for sharing this as blockstream also owns this subreddit, it's why the discussions stay one-sided, anyone that trys to talk about the obvious conflict of interest gets banned.

Explain how insider trading makes sense in the context of what happened with bch. I know what insider trading is , but your saying coinbase? was trading on inside information so please explain. In your op you said the price squeeze was obvious "insider trading", I'm not trying to pick on you but if your going to claim that then explain how it even makes sense here. 
I'm telling you that those kinds of squeezes can happen in illiquid markets. If you've ever watched small cap stocks, very thin liquidity because of a lack of institutional money, trade when some news comes out then you would know how common these price squeezes are.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:53:50
Bitcoin isn't a regulated commodity with regulated trading like other commodities. Why do so many newbies fail to understand this fact. 
Also the concept of insider trading doesn't even make sense in this context, and if you think it does explain how.
Crazy price moves like we saw are normal in seriously illiquid markets, its why you should never use market orders in this market, not everything is an evil conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:31:42
I asked for an explanation of why you think insider trading applies in the context of what happened yesterday. I know what insider trading is. 


Right... You ever learn about something called liquidity and price squeezes kiddo. You realize that this sort of price behavior is common in small cap stocks with zero institutional money and thin liquidity. The bch order book was very thin when trading opened, when a large amount of market orders came in they chewed through the available offers seeking liquidity and none was found until prices were sky high. Insider trading doesn't create price squeezes like this, insider trading would imply employees bought bch silently days before the release and distributed it to the public on opening.

Who was trading with privileged information, pls explain your conspiracy theory
Bch trading was introduced and the order book had very low liquidity at the time, especially on the offer side. A lot of market orders came in for bch which chewed through the offer side liquidity, remember market orders will seek out any liquidity and because the offers were so thin most market orders got filled at really high prices when they eventually hit some offers. 
The only thing you can blame Coinbase for is that they probably should have disabled market orders until sufficient liquidity had built up on the book. But then they would have to assume most buyers are idiots and don't know when to use a market order.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:22:38
Welcome to the show kid. The price on the exchange is the price of the last sale, so if it goes up really high it means someone was willing to pay that price and if it comes down quick well then no one else was left to buy at fhe high price. Not everything is a conspiracy kiddo.

Have you ever tried to buy anything with bitcoin. No one buys anything with bitcoin because they don't want to be hit with a $30+ fee and wait forever for a confirmation. BCH has the same proof of work as bitcoin and it only costs me $0.01 to send any amount of money instantly. Bitcoin was supposed to be a peer to peer internet currency, let's not kid ourselves bitcoin is not a currency anymore, it's become just a unusable commodity at this point.

Don't listen to this guy he has absolutely no idea what he's talking about. You can sell your futures contracts whenever you want just like you can sell your bitcoin whenever you want. Cboe Futures are a very liquid market so there is always a taker for your contract, unless you get locked limit down in which case you will have to wait for the next days open. I can literally buy a contract for next month and dump it tomorrow if I wanted to.

Yes. There is no central agency for any crypto exchange that disallow insider trading. The closest thing is for a derivative product on a Swedish exchange, XBT/USD, an exchange traded note. The CBOE also carries a regulated derivative of bitcoin, a futures product, but insider trading is normal in futures markets. Most exchanges don't have a regulating agency and the rare ones that do allow insider trading. Once again this isn't a stock kiddo.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:15:46
That doesn't make sense, if your invested and following the price it means you plan on selling in the future. Which means you didn't really adopt bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:59:34
Wow your a special kind of retard. Hyper inflation doesn't change the fact that's there is only 150 trillion USD worth of wealth in the world today, so if everyone in the world decided to sell all their belongings house, car, clothes, food just to buy bitcoin it would have a maximum buying power equivalent of 7 million USD today. The future value of the dollar doesn't change anything, if a hamburger is worth 150 trillion usd than 150 trillion USD in btc still only buys you a hamburger. It's just a number buying power is what matters.
It's all good kiddo, I understand you just got a little too excited by the price movements.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:51:21
Doesn't change anything. 150 trillion in total value today, if dollar hyperinflates that value flows somewhere else. So at 7 million USD buying power all wealth would have to flow into bitcoin.


@_date: 2017-11-02 00:33:37
I hate to break it you kiddo, but your a retard.
You realize theirs only about 150 trillion USD worth of total wealth in the world this includes all currencies, stocks, debt assets, and material assets like real estate. If all the worlds money were to go into bitcoin including all real estate, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, cars, yachts, if everyone in the world sold the clothes off their backs and their homes for internet money then bitcoin could max out at 7 million USD. Lololol.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:32:45


 
That's not a intangible asset. Come on guy, bitcoin doesn't own that property every single altcoin/shit coin can do that. That ability doesn't belong to bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't an entity that owns anything so no instrinsic value.

1) anyone can invest in the s&amp;p500, just sign up for a broker and buy an etf that tracks it. 
2) USA is still the world's biggest economy and the entire world is still investing in us debt and equities
3) and MOST big cap stocks have doubled or almost doubled in value over the last two years (tsla,ko,aaple,etc). The point is that  you need a well balanced portfolio because there's no such thing as safest stock.
4) Capital gains tax is very genourous, lowest tax in America. Inflation in America has been 1-1.5% the last eight years. Most online brokers cost just 5$ for an order no matter the size of the order.
5) You could make an argument that the market could be due for a correction after the last eight years, but that just provides an opportunity to get in. Also you can plan around this. The last crash in 2008 was just a little blip on the chart.
6) Once bitcoin stabilizes in value it won't be a great investment anymore, it's zero yield (think gold). Only reason for investors to hold it would be for hedging purposes. As of now btc is going up and is a good investment as long as it remains undervalued.


Because btc is a zero yield currency and once it stabilizes there's no money to be made, the same reason investors don't keep all their money in gold or a deflationary currency like the Japanese Yen. Inflationary currencies have a higher yield while btc and gold is good for hedging risk. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:03:23
WRONG stop spreading your misinformation OP. There are 5,820,203,717 ounces of gold in the world and 21 million bitcoin so it's actually 277 times rarer and with the price of an ounce of gold at 1300$ btc would need to be worth $360,000 to have the same market cap as gold.

I do some range trading, but with smaller size. Like if you check my post history I said I would take a smaller short position at 4200 and I'm currently up on that one. I'm gonna keep buying in the low 3000s and plan on dumping near the highs.

Ah yes the I can't do it so nobody else can either mentality. Look we are on the same side long term Bitcoin is going up, but until then there is going to be a lot of peaks and valleys, I've been trading this thing since 2015 using very simple tools ( Fibbonacci tools, trendlines, volume analysis) and its been one of the easiest markets to predict the peaks and valleys because 
they all fall in line. 
I'll show you how I do my analysis here take a look:
Notice how the peaks and valleys all fall in line when you look at the big picture, every single pump and dump in the last two years. If you chart it right it becomes very predictable. As you can see i'm predicting a move up to 7000 by February of next year we just need a healthy pullback first.

Dotcom bubble crashed because it was a bubble. When 90% plus of people begin buying something for speculation only you have a bubble that can burst. I'm willing to bet 99% of people holding btc only do it for the dollar gains, which is evident because price exploded this year as it got more media attention and that causes even more people to buy and bid it up. Bitcoin may be around long-term but it can crash anytime and a lot of people will get fucked, I trade in and out buy low sell high so I'm the one that's going to do the fucking as I sell at the top to some unsuspecting guy once again.

Only the clueless public keeps money in a savings account all my money is hedged in forex futures plus stored in etfs.
Inflation in the US is at all time lows for the last 8 years (1.4%) even though the government has printed trillions of us dollars in that time, most of that inflation is probably hiding in the stock market right now because I doubt any of that new money made its way down to the general public, wages have been stagnant for years now so somethings not adding up. I'm willing to bet those offshore accounts have something to do with it as well. The thing is inflation isn't a bad thing at all, inflation equals growth. Deficit spending is the reason why the US along with other first world countries are developed as they are, the world runs in debt. If we had a deflationary currency like btc as the only currency then how do you get a loan in fact why would anyone ever loan their btcs, no mortgage, car loans,student loans etc. The economy would stagnate. Don't try to give me a lesson on economics you don't know my background. Bitcoin is a speculative bubble and I'm going to keep on exploiting it, there's a reason why everyone clinches their asshole when btc/USD goes down cuz they all in it for profit and when 90%+ transactions are speculative you got yourself a bubble. So you can go shove your cryptocurrency pipe dream up your ass. Call me a sadist but the best feeling is selling near the peak and knowing the guy on the other side fucked up.

I have more trust in the US dollar than gold even though one is inflationary and gold is a relatively fixed supply, because gold is just a shiny metal wear as the dollar is backed by US treasury bonds.

If the dollar were to say crash and become worthless then bitcoin would also lose its value because 90%+ of people holding it are speculating on its USD value.

I got into trading futures while studying finance at UCLA, slowly learned the industry and currently trade contracts for everything from oil to coffee beans. Once you get over the initial learning curve it becomes very lucrative. 
All the talk of btc being so unpredictable is just a load of crap, it's one of the softest markets I've seen very emotionally driven. I'm able to trade in between ranges using nothing but price action, volume profile, and Fibonacci lines. I trade on up to 10% margin no stop loss, but my eyes never leave the screen when using leverage, average trade is usually just a couple hours. I have another account where I just dip buy, but the big money I've made is through trading between the ranges. If you know what your doing it's highly lucrative, I don't really care about bitcoin the tech I just live how volatile and exploitable this market is.

The first real advanced economy was created with the adoption of fiat currency, read up about the Roman and Greek empires. Gold was replaced with a minted metal alloy instead and their economies had the freedom to grow. Unless your talking about barter economies in which case you would be delusional to think that's better. A limited currency can't fund our current economy, if a deflationary currency was adopted the entire western world would have to severely limit it's spending causing a loss of jobs, deflation of real estate, and halt to economic growth as everyone decides to hoard their "gold."

Transaction flexibility like 10 minute transaction times plus a fee, no thanks I'll stick to my debit card. And I would love to hear about these multifunctional abilities that btc has.
Here's my prediction, as blockchain tech matures over the coming years with big tech firms like Amazon Google etc investing more money into new applications that can better utilise this new tech we will see bitcoin become obsolete with a new generation of "coins." Simply put if blockchain is the internet then bitcoin is pets.com
A "20 year stock trading vet" like you should know all about how that ended. Who knows you may have traded pets.com back when it was the future. Lol

Not insider trading and not illegal. In fact the big institutions use news and analysts to herd the public all the time. Gotta be able to discern the fake from real.
Dimon was being overly dramatic with his comments of fraud and people dieing, but you have to consider that bitcoin can't keep going up indefinitely so there will be a top ( no one can tell you when it's gonna happen). And some of us will inevitably buy that top.       
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:10:03
Lol some of the biggest companies by market cap collapsed because it was a speculative bubble. The ones that everyone invested in because they were the biggest and the future. The big players like Google and Amazon didn't emerge until much later.
Reality is bitcoin can be wiped out as soon as something better comes along so don't get too comfortable.

Yes they do read up on interest rate swaps, and stocks bonds will always be priced in USD.
Your obviously a financial retard and have no clue of what your talking about. Bitcoin will die when the next generation coin comes out and miners migrate. Make your money while you can before the bubble pops, I've already made 6 figures from crypto.

Target inflation is healthy it's a sign of healthy growth. Inflation encourages those with the money to reinvest it back I to the economy which further induces growth. There's a reason why big corporations and billionaires don't hold on to cash but instead invest their money back into the economy creating more jobs and income for everyone else. Everyone should have their money in some sort of investment, inflation only hurts those trying to hoard their cash which is also bad for an economy. Could you imagine if all the wealthy people were to just hoard all their money and never spend it that's what a fixed money supply would be like. Those with money would never let anyone else have it and everything would stagnate.

Extremely difficult to learn, especially on your own without a teacher. I would not recommend someone who already doesn't have an extensive background in trading to attempt trading bitcoin, most people would be better of holding because they would just get exploited. When I first started it was in spot forex and I would still recommend anyone that wants to begin learning how to trade start with forex. There's a r/forex sub that's pretty good, but a lot of beginners on there.

I've been trading btc since May 2017 when price had dipped down to just over 2k since than btc has doubled in value, but I have more than tripled my starting capital trading the ranges.


Everyone knows btc has been going up that doesn't mean you have to just hold it. This is one of the softest markets I've seen in a long time and is a lot easier to exploit than any other financial instrument out there right now, granted you know what your doing. As a "20 year stock vet" I'm sure you'be noticed.


Stock lolololol, and now I know you ain't got a clue as to what your talking about. There's nothing of intrinsic value behind btc nor does it generate cash flow this isn't a stock lol. It isn't a currency either, it has the potential for that one but not until it's value stabilizes and even then it would be as much of a currency as gold. Virtual commodity you can make a case for, but even that's a stretch because no one wants btc they only want USD, the dollar amount attached to it is the only thing that matters everyone is in it to make a profit. A pure speculation bubble that's ripe for traders to pick apart.
 
       
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:34:33
Yea I'm ready to fuck all you crypto dickriders. In the end I'm gonna take all your dollars and you let you keep the shitcoins.  
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:41:36
Lol maybe for financial illiterates like you bitcoin will be a good way to avoid inflation, you must be one of those guys that hoards all his money under the mattress. But most people that have a clue what their doing can passively make 10-20% a year, learn to make your money work for you. The current system rewards those who invest back into their economy and hurts those who want to hoard their capital. By your logic everyone must be holding all their money gold right now, once btcs value stabilizes it won't be a good investment anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:25:51
1) wrong you can open an account with an international broker and buy spy just as easily as an American. I used to work for the front desk for IB Group, trust me you don't know shit.
Buying and selling high on margin. I actually got back in on the dip to 3k so will see how much more I can make.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:03:10
Well I do this for a living, I trade commodities and fx futures contracts so the added work of micromanaging my positions isn't anything new. Also I don't see a future for btc so I would never invest in it, but I'm sure many would disagree. I'm attracted to how exploitable it is compared to what I usually trade, very emotionally driven market.  
And I think you need to brush up on your understanding of intrinsic value, anyways good luck in your btc investment venture.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:57:48
Learn the mechanics behind why price goes up and down and you'll understand why it can't. It can only go as high as someone is willing to pay for it would you pay 100k for a bitcoin, who knows maybe you would. 
The only reason anyone would pay that much and the reason why it's even got to 5k already is because people feel it will continue to go up and it might, but the important part is that what really matters is the USD amount attached to btc. We are all competing with each other I want to buy and have others buy after me. I will pay as long as I think I can make a profit , but now what happens when everyone is looking for a profit and the buying has exhausted. Hint it's gonna be real bad for some people.

Last week was one of the best things that could happen to bitcoin. We pulled back to a very nice technical level to make a higher low. That just makes the bullish trend stronger, but this sub is full of idiots that think if it wasn't for Dimon or China btc would just be surging higher. Going straight up without a retracement is just unhealthy. That pullback helped relieve some pressure and gives btc a chance to break 5k.

Speak for your self bud. I trade contracts for metals, oil, forex for a living and this bitcoin market is one of the softest I've seen in a long time.

May not be the most popular idea amongst the "hodlers" but you will benefit from a lower entry
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:40:17

Smart contracts only work alongside a fiat currency. The guy I'm replying to thinks it would be better to replace USD with a zero yield currency altogether. 
I can see crypto tech with smart contracts working alongside fiat currency in the future, but to think the world would ever get rid of inflationary currency for a non-yielding currency is stupidity. As long as there is an inflationary economy somewhere big business and investors are going to flock to it.

Wrong. Price consolidated under the top of the monthly range and broke out to 4k after the split, I traded that 500$ range for almost three weeks. 
The point is that demand was muffled before the split. Anyone with any charting experience can look at daily chart of Btc and see that it's due for a price correction (which we've got right now - I've been saying for almost a week that I would be buying at 3000) and that we need some consolidation in that range to build a floor.

Inflation in the US has been less than 2% per year for the last decade.

Like I said I double my money every year trading futures contracts. I've been trading crypto currency when it was dirt cheap before regular people even knew about it, and I've already made enough to buy a house and then some. I'm actually going to buy a new Benz soon with some of the coins I sold a couple weeks ago, so I have no problem enjoying the gains. I don't care about bitcoin at all, I just like living large and I'm going to keep selling my bitcoins at the top and reloading and doing it again. Trust me you don't want to buy from me, lol. This crypto bull market doesn't even compare to the '08 oil short or the '12 gold short, its just another opportunity to make real money for me.

Because once bitcoins value stabilizes there won't be any reason to hold on to a zero yield asset anymore except for hedging against potential risk. The smart money keep getting richer because they invest in the economy, but the majority of people are unfortunately financial illiterates and choose to hoard their money in savings accounts and buy gold. In the last eight years the equity markets have quadrupled in value while gold has lost almost half its value. Equity markets will endure through the big corrections and continue to grow with the economy while assets like gold and bitcoin will produce zero value and stagnate. 
We don't know where bitcoins stable price point will be in the future so it's a good long term investment for now.
