Once can only hope but I think the way things are going they would be stupid not to
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:33:51
I hope you are correct but btc has been on such a run it's is way over bought. I think we will see a pull back. I hope I'm wrong
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:27:00
No it doesn't but it shows how much mainstream attention we will get.

Mainstream is waking up
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:36:54
Bitcoin especially

I'm curious to see if enterprise will build their own block chains or utilize existing platforms like ethereum, stratis etc etc 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:24:56
Yes they are just look at the ethereum alliance

Aha i can't argue that. These old companies are trying their best not to be left behind.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:03:35
I think the last 2 weeks would agree with you.
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:14:23
We  both know they will fuck it up.

Do we really want wall street here ??
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:03:38
BCoin is that the next btc fork? ��
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:27:55
No intrinsic value in bitcoin or in gold ? 
I would argue there is intrinsic value in gold as it is widely used outside of a value store.

It very well may or it may reward them. For all we know they are just hedging their long positons in this time of uncertainty. One things is for sure, volatility is where the whales make their money.

I agree that more choices is always better. I really see Ether giving bitcoin a run for its money in the long term but many other crypto's have a long way to go. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:31:06






Agreed, for all we know Satoshi is a government 
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:29:21
I don't have enough comment karma to post there yet.
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:43:01
I will agree with this but do you think not having a centralized technical lead will hurt bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:20:13


If it is not very useful why is there gold in the computer or smartphone you are using right now?
I realize the total value of gold is not because it is that useful but for other reasons but can you tell me what makes bitcoin digital currency over any other crypto? is it just the history of the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:26:47






Good question
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:56:53
Sad but true. 
I'm surprised that Ethers dev team hasn't been attacked more
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:29:18


Honestly the more I think and analyze the market place, I agree with you. Ether is much more like gold then bitcoin. Not saying Bitcoin doesn't have a place or is going away.
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:25:44
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:56:15
ZERO Chance..They would have already done this if they could
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:27:50
That's what scares me about bitcoin, the first mover never survives. Maybe bitcoin can change this pattern?
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:17:46


I agree it will be interesting to see how it all plays out. I don't think Ether or Bitcoin will be used for daily transactions by the mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:14:13
this could very well be the case 
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:42:30
Thank you for those links and descriptions.
Do you think there might be conflicts within bitcoin when it is trying to decide what it actually is? currency or a value store like gold. Realistically I cant see it acting as both because hoarders would drastically cut the supply of bitcoin in circulation if it was used as a value store. To function as currency it needs to have high volume to simulate demand.
Just my two cents  
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:31:10


From my understanding Ethereum inflation will actually be below bitcoins for the next 100 years after POS comes around. I do agree having a set limit does benefit bitcoin but in the white papers of ether it is stated Inflation will be just to replace lost of destroyed coins. All of this is ways off any ways. I do agree that ether wont be used a currency for the mainstream.

The only thing that is for sure is the price is going to move one way or the other but volatility is very real traders make their $$$. So the more volatility the better but if you are a long term holder I think August 1st will be a non event looking back after a week or 2
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:32:03
Makes sense, look how ether reacted when rumours of V's death started.
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:41:47
Yes the market has chosen it to be the leader at this point but I was curious why the market has chosen it. Is it the historical trust that as it is the first and oldest?
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:03:34
I believe you are referring to your public wallet address and your private key.
Your public address is the address of the location of your wallet on the public blockchain. This is used for people to send money to your wallet.
Your private key is used for you to access funds on your wallet. Do not share this with anyone. This key allows you to control fund on your wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:58:38
ahah this statement couldn't be closer to the truth. I suspect the hacker interest is just paid FUD.
