It makes sense, considering that you already factored in the busiest day as you said. Thanks for answering, as always.

Who wouldn’t want some of BRD token? It’s killing it.
Also, it still doesn’t allow choosing the fee.
The UI is awesome, though.

I wish I could help you... but price seems like it will stay there for a while, and it isn't likely to reach 10k.
Just sell as little as possible, it's very difficult to time the market, you never know which way it's going.

What a beautiful day to wake up, walk outside and don't look at bloody price in all day...
Dammit, back in red.

Just pointing out that Breadwallet was rebranded a while back, now it's called [BRD](
Maybe u/castorfromtheva wants to take notice.

TL;DR: Bitcoin is not anonymous, but if you are buying something legal (or ilegal of little value) chances are no one is ever going to care.
Longer story. The bitcoin blockchain is an open and public ledger, tracking coins is trivial for anyone interested in doing so. Transactions from the exchange to your address, and from your address to the recipients, are in the open. If you got your coins in an exchange that enforces KYC-AML, then the police can ask (with a warrant) them about the owner of that address. However, that is highly unlikely unless you get yourself into something you really shouldn't be doing.
Some [very basic reading](

Also, that’s the way it works, no matter the wallet being used. It can be BRD on iOS, or any other.
However, there are developments being made towards more privacy... until then, assume things can be tracked.
Of course; there are ways to “mix things up”, but I’ve never used them and can’t comment on them.

Anyone had access to your device? Does it enforce a PIN or input pattern for unlocking? Anyone close to you knows it? Sometimes it's roommates, not hackers!
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:24:37
Yeah, clearly the comic got the math wrong.
But I'd add one thing: if you want fees to remain very low and predictable, then the blockchain must never reach capacity, not even at peak times, so that people don't engage in a fee market (*users upping their fees so as to make sure they get into the next block, which rapidly snowballs into higher fees for everyone*).
There is indeed a multiplying factor to be taken into account somewhere, I don't have the empirical data, maybe it's 2x, maybe it's 10x. Let's say it's 3x for the sake of having some numbers.
So, if Alipay handled 1 billion transactions as per your link, if that traffic was to be absorbed by bitcoin, then the network should be able to absorb at least 3 times as many transactions in a day so that fees don't go crazy. That'd be around **3e9 transactions requiring 8 GB blocks average**, wouldn't it?
No, it doesn't fix the comic book calculations, but I thought it was something worth considering.

Flawless, I also believe the satoshi is better suited for everyday use than a whole BTC.
However, don't forget that using billion as "a thousand million" (10\^9) is not global. A billion in Europe is  "a million million" (10\^12).
It's usually not an issue becase most units are big enough that billions are not that common, but in the case of Satoshi... it will be common unless BTC price skyrockets...
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:37:35
Absolutely, 8GB peak, not average.
Also, what do you make about this multiplying factor? From your experience, any educated guess? Or, better still, data?
@_date: 2018-08-30 09:59:17
12 is 21 turned around. 21 as in 21 million bitcoin.
PS: 1+2=3, Half Life 3 confirmed.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:39:44
Just buy it. A sensible amount, don't get crazy or you may regret it (you can always buy more when you're 18).
Remember: Don't leave it in the exchange, put it on a wallet on a trusted device (mobile is better than laptop) and keep a handwritten copy of the seed somewhere it can't get easily found/destroyed.
@_date: 2018-08-26 12:20:53
No problem, I had the same doubts back in the day!
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:43:18
Tears of joy... nice!

I don't know why people are so eager to see Bitmain (and BCH, by extension) burn.
BCH is a Top 5 crypto by market cap, a very bad metric, but the one most people follow. If BCH dies, BTC takes an huge arrow to the knee. The general public doesn't know or care about the difference, and the media will feast on the news "**bitcoin** **^(cash)** **is done**". The whole crypto place could collapse for weeks or months. Confidence will fall like a stone.
So Bitmain, if you're gonna die, die slowly. And don't dump.
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:57:36
Bonus point: it could be at a slightly lower cost :)
Also, happy to see I'm not the only one that loves nice round numbers. It gets worse when you transfer some BTC and the fees spoil the decimals all over the place...
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:55:14
It works very well, indeed. I used SEPA, but the same dynamic.
Many hate Coinbase, but they really are the beginner's place to buy and trade crypto. The UI is clean, everything is nice and seamless. Easy as pie, and cheap as long as you make a transfer and don't use a credit card.
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:47:32
First of all, unless you need to use their credit card o something like that, it doesn't seem you *need permission*. Asking for it shows respect and class, kudos.
My advise would be to forego all wording around "investment", it's not investing, you are young and bitcoin is the future, **you are educating yourself in the blockchain tech, which is going to be huge**. That angle is likely to be much better understood. 
Also, **start small**. Tell them it's only a small amount, like $10. Then wait for a few days and tell them about the experiment. Set up a wallet for them on their smartphone and send them a few dollars' worth of BTC. They may end up investing themselves once they see it actually work :D
In any case, my advise is **don't trade**, you will likely lose money. And invest a small amount, bitcoin could be huge or could collapse tomorrow if a critical bug is found on the code, nobody knows. Invest something that you can afford to lose.
Good luck!

If you're asking about the technical side, it comes from the miners (it's a long story), I'd advise watching any of the dozen "what is Bitcoin" videos on Youtube, and then reading the whitepaper, and then watching [Andreas M. Antonopoulos]( channel on Youtube. It takes a while, but it's worth it.
If you're asking about the economy, or the trade value... it comes from us, people buying and selling. Some for profit, some for ideals, some because it's a geek's dream, some because it might be the global currency of the future... choose your side! The market value changes a lot because the above groups also change a lot, they have their ups and downs.
In any case, whatever you do, if you buy... **don't daytrade**. We all tried that. Most learned the hard way that being a trader is a full-time job, it's steep learning, it's expensive learning in such a volatile and manipulated market.
Buy. Hodl. Spend if you like, then buy some more. And keep learning!
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:29:02
Yep. Count me in.
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:21:33
So, let me have this clear, you believe that if any of the big alts collapse (eth, ltc, xrp o bch...)  the result will be "meh"? I'm talking about a big sudden collapse, not "losing ground for years until irrelevance". I stand that if any big alts gets smashed big time, it can't be good for BTC or the cypto space as a whole.
But we can disagree, of course.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:38:54
It's been almost a year since I first bought. It's been kinda fun. I suffered at the beginning, but now I'm battle hardened.
I hodl!
