You've got to be kidding me.  Read the post! You've literally sent:
* Have you logged your issue with our main support channel?
THREE separate times without reading the rest of the post.  In the main post, I have stated that I've logged this issue already and have PMed you SEVERAL times and all I get is:
* Have you logged your issue with our main support channel?
It's appalling.

I went cash direct to my BTC wallet through zip-zap

this proves my point.  You are responding to me in two separate threads and yet have no knowledge of it.  You've copy/pasted the same response in both threads.  You've told me to log my issue 4 times in the past 15 minutes, even though I've already told you (4 times) that I HAVE logged my issue.  17 days and all you say is that you've given it a manual push? Gee thanks for the stellar support.
My order was given to zipzap, and i got a confirmation that it went through, but I have yet to see my BTC in my blockchain wallet.
The ZipZap account is: 103749099
Total amount spent was $423.95 on April 8th, 2013.

thanks, but I've still not heard anything from them.  Gonna make yet another thread

I already have! How many different ways is there to tell you guys this?! I've logged it, PMed you, PMed the Mandrik guy, written in your forums, EVERYTHING.  There is NO excuse for your terrible service.

The exact same thing happened to me as well.  They didn't fund my account with the amount they should have.  Then I sent them my order multiple times and kept getting the runaround.  Absolutely ridiculous how poor this service is.

Yes, please.  That is why I gave you the account info and date/amount of the transaction.  I also have the wallet address if you need that.

Yesterday, I spent $425 in cash via money gram at a local grocery store. Through bitinstant, it was supposed to be deposited into my blockchain account. After fees and everything, I was supposed to have the equivalent of $405 and some change. Instead, I ended up with $380. No idea where the other $25 went, and they say they don't either.

Albertsons -&gt; bitcoin wallet.  Just because it worked fine for you doesn't mean that things are working fine for other users.  Like i said, I have had smooth transactions with them before, BUT when/if a problem arises, they are extremely difficult to get ahold of and generally have very poor service.  Address was accurate, I have a zipzap verification code that I have given them, I've given them the transaction ID 3 separate times, and I have also given them my bitcoin wallet address twice.
My issue isn't with their lag time, it's with the horrible customer service.

I've been trying EVERY avenue since April 8th to get my transaction resolved, but I keep getting the same canned PM from them: 
"Have you used bitinstant.com/contact? You will be helped as soon as possible! :)"
What the fuck? Like, c'mon.  He even copy/pasted the SAME reply twice in the same message thread.  It's obvious they don't care about people with small transactions (mine was only 3BTC).  Super frustrating.  11 days and I've lost like $425.

SO basically you're saying that logging it doesn't do anything since I'm now going to also give you all my info on here? Sigh...if it helps get this fixed then I'll do whatever.

I've PMed them twice in the last 24 hours and haven't gotten a respose! I swear it's like they only respond if you post publicly!
Cmon guys!

22 days for me, and still nothing.  So, it's still pretty fucking shady.
