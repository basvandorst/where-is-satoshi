Well the tech has always been flawed
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:10:00
Its litterally impossible to make that kind of change on the Bitcoin network, you would need to fork it and essentially rewrite just about everything
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:09:36
? That makes no sense, in order for it to no longer be a blockchain it would need changing, you can't change the blockchain itself tf?
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:44:03
Okay but its impossible to disagree, you cant make changes like that, thats the whole reason forks exist

Whats your opinion on IOTA/NANO
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:01:22
Of course you could always play on the side of "unprooven tech" but IOTA specifically seems to be hitting every note on point
Becoming the industry standard by ecl and Object Management Group
Constant testing by huge security companies
Hell their main wallet has been audited 3 times by said companies, what can you say for Bitcoin besides "so far its worked" IOTA has also been doing stress tests revealing just how strong their tech can get when under a bunch of pressure, combine this with the support of some of the biggest company partnerships and you have a pretty solid coin

You'll lose it all, sorry kiddo
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:03:48
My point is that bitcoin wont succeed under its current structure
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:14:01
But the tech isn't solid, its massively outdated
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:21:21
I'm not actually richard lol
I'm actually "shilling" DAG's
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:29:22
The foundation was rather solid, meanwhile everything about Bitcoin is flawed and its decentralized it would take a whole fork just to change anything so Bitcoin is dead
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:58:30
I don't believe cryptos should utalize blockchains, what a stupid concept to have it slow down with more usage, DAG's completly skip over this scalability problem and many others, it was a mistake for satoshi to use it
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:47:47
I dont understand what you arent getting
YOU CANT BUILD THIS TYPE OF THING ONTOP OF  BITCOIN AS ITS DECENTRALIZED
Its not that hard to understand, you need to start from scratch
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:22:50
Not at all
Microsoft made corrections, Bitcoin can't, earlier Microsoft computers had mistakes, so did Bitcoin
I don't see whats wrong with saying its a mistake
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:54:35
After your tech is fully proven to work well, bitcoin does not work well under stress at all
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:43:42
We were litterally just talking about it, the change from blockchain to something more stable, you said the internet was flawed originally however the internet is a different case as changes would be much easier
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:17:33
That was when people thought the idea of blockchain in currency was a good idea
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:10:55
Since when has it been making 600% gains? Back when Bitcoin was considered "Inovative tech"?
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:25:58
Makes sense, he's a scam artist
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:24:43
Pretty much
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:40:02
No but like, actual scammer
His name isn't even richard heart, he publicly admitted it after someone found ties to crimes under another name, his crypto hex is also a huge get rich quick scam that's only purpose is to make himself rich
