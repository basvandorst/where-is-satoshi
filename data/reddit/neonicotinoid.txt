That is stupid. You know when the bubble bursts, a lot of people will lose their bitcoins and feel cheated. They will say "I was ripped in that bitcoin ponzi scheme", giving bitcoin bad press. Ponzi schemes are illegal for a reason. It's a scam and it's unethical.

Mark Karpeles is having a party on let's say the 15th of Februari. Don't miss it!

@_date: 2014-02-24 18:43:15
A very negative article, but regulation is welcome. It is not an investigation "against" bitcoin, but an investigation "of" bitcoin.
 "protecting consumers and addressing lawbreakers without hindering innovation" is a noble cause, and as we are seeing in California, regulation does not have to mean "clamping down on digital currencies".
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:47:21
Can you put some stats on your site? Like the number of downloads, pdf/epub, bitcoins received?

It looks to me as if Zhou Tong was framed by Mark Karpeles. All the incriminating evidence came from one source.

I think it's clear they are (he is) splitting it up into inconspicuous chuncks, to then send them to a mixing pool, and get away with the whole 180K undetected.
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:38:17
The answer is, of course that this is not the right perspective. We don't want to have our wealth in $ and then, when it's time to buy something, convert to bitcoin. The point is that if you have your wealth in bitcoin, and you can get goods and services in exchange for bitcoin, there are no exchange fees. But he illustrates nicely that indeed the price for goods and services are determined relative to fiat currency. If that ever shifts to bitcoin, it will be $ that seem highly volatile and risky to hold.
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:18:06
lol No

Simple indeed, but is it the simple future or the simple past?
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:16:31
The only thing we know for sure, is what's on the website: he's working on a solution.
I mean we can't know if he is indeed working on a solution, but we can be sure this information comes from Karpeles himself and wasn't manufactured by someone else.
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:54:46
This is the lamest protest I have ever seen in my entire life. You're not even at the right address, since they moved on the 19th. Find out where Karpeles lives and follow him to work. And don't just stand there, break out the goddamned molotov cocktails!
@_date: 2014-03-13 10:58:06
9 . On February 7, 2014, all bitcoin withdrawals were halted by MtGox due to the theft or disaappearance of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins owned by MtGox customers as well as MtGox itself.
Karpeles declares before the court that he knew the extent of the problem on the 7th. This realisation shouldn't have prompted him to just halt withdrawal, but also to stop trading. Not doing so was a crime he should be hanged for.
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:16:47
Shame on um... Can't get fooled again!
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:35:35
Not mentioning that their fiat withdrawals are still going through (albeit at the ever slow pace or even slower now) is just intentional misinformation. They intentionally quoted the announcement around the fact that only bitcoin withdrawals are affected. I expect nothing less from this source.
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:36:53
So why then, do we see the GOXcoins moving on the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:04:25
Beer: on it.
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:49:57
That is false. How much money they should have against the total of cash deposits has nothing to do with the trading value of bitcoins. Every bitcoin that was traded, at whatever price, just moved fiat from one of their accounts to the other (minus fees of course). They should still have all the money. They're not in the business of handing out loans.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:15:47
Good call! I hope you manage your own wallet.
@_date: 2014-09-16 09:26:54
Nope, We can't. Tried it.
Only visa and paypal. Sorry Assange, no deal.
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:22:36
I'm not smart enough to see what the consequences would be of the exchange rate of different fiat currencies fluctuating relative to each other. I assume someone buying coins with dollars from someone accepting euro involves converting the currency, which I imagine they will do at a rate to their advantage. I have no idea.
As for what's going on with gox I have no inside information, but I think they should have suspended trading all together until their withdrawal problems are solved. I don't know for sure if they're taking advantage of the situation by trading on their own exchange, but I'm sure they could if they wanted to. Also I'm not sure if they are using technical issues as an excuse to be able to do this, or if they even planned it that way themselves. I think all that is within the possibilities. I guess it will be up to the prosecutors to prove it all, if it turns out to be illegal at all.
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:24:26

Let A be the alcohol space to draw from and n the number of people drinking, of which f be the fraction of females, then I propose there exists an f that for any n in A will be optimal for sexytimes. Call it neonicotinoid's theorem.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:05:56
Yet that is exactly what he declares under oath. 
I don't know if his lying to the public on the internet is illegal, but I'm pretty sure his declaration contains a few flat-out lies too.


This is clearly all lies. There was no bug in the bitcoin software algorithm, the bitcoin network wasn't hacked. There was a bug in *his* software and *he* was hacked, but he already knew at that point that this did not cause all the bitcoins to disappear. There would be no large wallets that were proven to be under the control of gox left if this were the case, because that mechanism would have been through small transactions at a time. 
He also didn't lose any private keys in the sense that they became inaccessible, because those wallets have shown activity recently: they have split up into small chuncks. 
I conclude that Marie is full of shit and is trying to get away with all the BTC himself.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:27:54
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:48:35
There can only be bought as much as there is sold in a single time interval though, so no this answer is incorrect. They are selling as fast as they are buying.
The correct answer is they *want* to sell more than they want to buy, so they are offering to sell more than they are offering to buy, causing lower priced sell offers to lead to actual trades.
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:41:57
That's right. And also, merchants should try to keep their prices fixed in bitcoin. "It's one BTC today, it will be one BTC tomorrow. No sorry, $500 was yesterday, today you pay $1000."
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:26:43
Ok that's who he is, now the more important part of the question, please!

That businessplan probably took a few hours of work to make. For a multimillion dollar operation, it is pretty feeble and slim. It misses some main content that would be absolutely necessary for a document like that.
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:03:01
Never in my life have I seen a more lame protest. Find out where Karpeles lives and follow him to work, then you'll at least be at the right address. And throw stuff!

That's right, you tell'em Joe!
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:53:30


Not due to a bug in the withdrawal procedure! Due to the fucking DISSAPPEARANCE of HUNDERDS OF THOUSANDS of bitcoins.
So he decides "well we don't have bitcoins so withdrawal will have to halt, but they can keep spending their money on all the phony bitcoin balances for two more weeks"
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:09:05
Where does this come from?
@_date: 2014-05-07 11:23:30
I disagree. The exchange fees buying and selling BTC will be a lot less than what your bank will charge for the currencyA&gt;currencyB exchange and the international transactions. Also, the odds in a casino are against you.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:01:35
I think it's a good thing they suspend trading. They should have done this from the start, the moment BTC withdraws were stopped.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:15:03
But I have a copy of the blockchain, so yeah, I do have all the coins.
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:19:51
If he would have bought the coins he has as high as they have been and sold them right now, then yes you are right.
So: no, you are wrong.
@_date: 2014-07-14 11:55:46
I like the colors! 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:55:43
This is my explanation: gravity.
Clearly bitcoin has gained a lot of weight this last year in only Taiwon. Therefore it is being pulled down.
I call it my Pull Down Syndwome.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:52:43
Yes, I'm hacker too. I hacked bitcoin similarly. Its nice hack too. Velly reet hacking skills! 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:16:29
I think you copy-pasted some big words there.
It is obvious that a trader's positions are subject to fluctuations. That is beside the point. Mtgox is not a trader, mtgox is the exchange.
The total amount of fiat money in all the user accounts only changes when users deposit or withdraw funds and when fees are charged. The trading value or fluctuations thereof do not in any way influence this.
The same goes for the bitcoins. The sum of all bitcoins in all the user accounts (=the total bitcoins in the exchange) equals the sum of all bitcoin deposits minus all bitcoin withdrawls (and fees).
I hope this helps. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.
@_date: 2015-08-03 12:05:42
lol it's Marie.
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:26:08
The only way I can see this promoting bitcoin is that maybe more vendors will be interested in offering to sell for bitcoin straight up, knowing they can now use them anywhere.
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:18:48
In the end, it's just the same as selling your bitcoins for fiat and stepping out of the game. I really don't see the benefit for bitcoin in this. For bitcoin to mature, the merchants need to accept and keep bitcoins, and pay their suppliers with it, who should do the same.
@_date: 2015-02-23 07:58:00
This scandal is still happening right now! Karpeles is still not in jail, the money is being spent right under our noses by the perpetrators and corrupt officials. Japan should be very ashamed.
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:23:49
I think he looks just dandy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:08:33
I don't need banks to get my bitcoins. I'm happy to be productive and get payed bitcoins, which actually is the whole point. Fuck banks.
@_date: 2013-11-08 07:30:30
The point of BTC is not having to buy back the evil currencies anymore. Traders kind of miss that point.
I would rather see the price of a loaf of bread in a chart like that.
