To decrease the stress of those failing banks is simple. Decrease the barrier of entry for new banks. As bank numbers grow, so will jobs, and you will eventually eliminate the single point of failure phenomenon.

That is the obvious solution. But how do we educate the public to these facts with enough scale and speed that would make positive changes? The right thing to do is always unpopular it seems.

So, does that mean the 600K bitcoins are now basically gone from circulation if theoretically nobody is able to retrieve the coins even the owner?
If this is the case, then the value of bitcoins should go up right? Since there are less coins for everyone.

Gotcha. Thanks for the explanation. Do you agree with moving all BTC out of 3rd party by Aug 1st? Is it safe to leave them at Coinbase?

Guys, what about using multiple online wallets, 1 BTC per wallet. Wouldn't take diversify your risk? If you don't want to go through the paper wallet route.

Ok so let's say no one will ever get to them... that means these coins are lost forever right?

Anyone know of any good youtube vids on this?
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:32:36
No no, it's for science and research purposes.
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:11:52
Can someone please explain how this works? For someone who has an online wallet already... QR code+ipad jams me up

Nobody is perfect. Even Gandhi was racist during his time in Africa and he wasn't faithful but the good things he has done can be highlighted and learned from just like Jackson.

Well I learned about it from this post. I had no idea there was such a thing.
