A prediction like this is worthless without a quantitative error estimator (read: error bars).
I know these are hard to do, but without an error estimate, how can I rely on your prediction in any way?

The miners decide what values of transaction fees they accept. It the miners decide to require a certain amount, only transactions with fees above that amount will go into the blocks these miners create.
As long as *some* miners accept feeless transactions, they will end up in the block chain eventually, but it may take a very long time.

You can just walk there, put in some money, and recieve bitcoins. Instantly.
No hassle of transferring funds first, no delays, and (if you pay cash): it's anonymous.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:45:18
No, there is no separate reciept. The ATM in Helsinki's asematunneli has the nice feature that a nearby fast-food chain provides free wifi coverage there, so transferring bitcoins to a wallet on a mobile phone allows you to immediately verify the transaction.
This works extremely well, it typically arrives within 3 seconds of pressing the "confirm" button.
As for your second question: no, most bitcoin ATMs are simple bitcoin vending machines, that only work one way (money in, bitcoins out).

You are correct that bitcoin, as a store of value, is working just fine.
However, there was a time, about 3 years ago, where it also operated marvellously as a day-to-day currency. You could go to a store and buy a coffee with it, you could buy groceries and send small tips to reddit comments you liked. (Yes, I did all this).
High fees due to full blocks made these applications impractical, so they have mostly disappeared. Some people want them back, and do not want to wait for promised (but nebulous) second-layer solutions. These are the people that want to increase the block size.

Indeed. And since large amounts of money are involved, people are easily afraid of losing their investments. Hence extremist positions (on both sides) are so common.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:04:28
There is a fundamental split in the community about the values that drive bitcoin.
There are the decentralization extremists, for whom *the* most important feature of bitcoin is its decentralized structure, and the fact that everybody can run a node on a raspberry pi. Any change that removes this ability, and that would cause an increased use of storage or memory is rejected by them, even if it means that bitcoin is more clumsy to use. This group uses They have stayed true to their values, and created a currency that has proven to be a unsubvertible, highliy priced store of value with very interesting opportunities for investment and trade of large amounts of money. This is the bitcoin we all know and value.
On the other side, there are people for whom decentralization is less important. They have experienced how bitcoin was useable as a day-to-day currency with which you can buy coffee and tip cent-values to reddit comments that you like. For them, it is more important that bitcoin remains effortlessly useable, that fees remain low and confirmations remain fast, even if it means giving up decentralization and leaving control in the hands of a less decentralized network of datacenters. These people have been scared away from and formed Eventually, they forked off Bitcoin Cash.
Both of these are extremist positions, and both camps are certain that the other side is an attack by paid shills. Communication between the two is not possible.
I suggest you read both subreddits, downvote the trolls that scream bloody murder on both sides, and engage in constructive discourse. Eventually, you will be banned on one side, and downvoted to oblivion on the other, but at least you did your part.

It looks more and more we'll be stuck with 4mio weight (1MB base block size) blocks for the forseeable future, and availability of second layer solutions is not anywhere around the corner yet, either, so bitcoin will most likely become impractical for buying sandwiches (in favour of being a globally traded, extremely valuable commodity that is used in investment).
Do you have a good idea what you as a merchant can do about it? Besides accepting other cryptocurrencies? 
Edit: 1MB blocks → 4 Mio weight blocks

However, few people had the cryptologic skills to thoroughly verify the cryptographic soundness of the bitcoin system themselves. Most of us are basically blindly trusting that the system doesn't have any big blatant flaws (and in hindsight, it seems to turn out correct).
What could just as well have happened is that somebody had found a fundamental protocol bug, stolen vast amounts of btc, the value would have collapsed and cryptocurrencies as a whole would have probably been reduced to a fringe market niche.
The assumption that this could have happened (and in theory, could still happen) is the only thing that holds me back from going all-in with my live savings.

TIL the last bitcoins I sold last week have subsequently been part of a 14000 BTC transaction. What are these people doing? I guess I'll never know.

Also remember that at that point, there was no block size limit, and the 1MB that we are running with now was only an arbitrary afterthought.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:56:37
The deadline is the fork. If the transaction giving you the coins is in the block before, you are good. If it is in a block after, you might not.
This is a bit tricky, since both forked chains will continue to process unconfirmed transactions. But there is no guarantee that the minority chain will be able to put them into a block afterwards. Thus, you should make sure your transaction is included in a block before.

@_date: 2017-10-04 10:35:35
But that is beside the point here.
For now, and until the split day in november, btc1 nodes are perfectly well-conforming nodes that do nothing shady at all. There is no need to disconnect them beforehand, it only hurts the network as a whole.
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:00:22
This might be. But as you say, the date is known. Why block them beforehand?
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:42:15
Where did you get the idea that the segwit2x chain must start with a 1MB block? It certainly isn't in the [specification]( and also doesn't make any real sense. Of course, the first &gt;1MB block after the activation date will cause the hardfork to happen, but enforcing it is unneccessary imho.
Segwit2x wants to be the majority chain, and certainly has the hashpower behind it to be that. If the majority of hashpower were to abandon it, and it were overtaken by a &lt;=1MB chain in terms of proof of work, it would be right and legitimate for the chains to reorganize. This is how nakamoto consensus works.
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:28:58
But what prevents people from just running core with changed consensus rules? It's really just two lines of code in consensus.h that you need to change, and your node will follow 2X when it forks off.
All of this banning and preferential connecting to certain node types seems really silly.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:56:58
It is. Two numbers in consensus/consensus.h. I have done it myself and run such a node.
They do not need to run btc1, so why would they? The core codebase is just fine for running 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:45:22
By that definition, the US Dollar would be bitcoin. (Yes, I'm trolling.)
Everybody is of course entitled to their own opinion about what "proper" bitcoin is. The great thing here is that we do not *need* to agree: the network and it's incentives are balanced out in such a way that nakamoto consensus is found automatically. The market controls the financial incentive for the miners, and the miners control the security of the blockchain, which is an incentive for the market. Even if their consensus diverges, it won't do so for long, otherwise both of them lose.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:11:04
Market capitalization is not money. Even though it is measured in USD, it does not have a direct relation to the amount of value stored in the asset. It is a measurable quantity of the market size, but it is *not* money.
You are doing the same mistake here that Donald Trump did earlier this week, where he compared the rise of stock market capitalization with the US national debt: even though both are measured in Dollars, one is money while the other isn't.
Thus, this comparison doesn't really mean anything.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:33:09
Modifying core to run along with the 2X fork is a trivial two-line change though. So that doesn't mean anything.
The btc1 codebase is just a separate playground.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:43:44
I'm running 0.15.0.1 with some changes I made myself, so it will follow the 2X chain when it forks off (basically just a couple of numbers in consensus.h changed and the service bits disconnection logic removed).
This means when the hard fork happens, I will continue to follow the chain with most proof of work in it, and I will continue to broadcast transactions between 2X and NO2X nodes. Disconnecting btc1 nodes basically doesn't help at all, since there will be plenty nodes like mine that bridge between both sides of the network. It's silly and counterproductive.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:11:05
You can totally follow the 2X chain with a core node though. A simple change of the values in src/consensus/consensus.h is all that is required. There's really no reason to use btc1's implementation.

Sorry if this came accross as trying to advocate for bigger blocks specifically. That was not the point I was trying to make.
Rather, and I believe I'm agreeing with you perfectly in this, I tried to point out that there are things about bitcoin that seem to be desinged in an ingenious manner. The incentives of mining and fees are extremely well balanced and cause bitcoin to function despite being extremely inefficient as a datastructure per se.
The value for the block size limit however does not appear to be a product of intensive analysis, but, as you said "fortunately gotten right". The scaling discussion we are having whether this arbitrary number should be scaled by an arbitrary factor of two, and I actually don't like either of them. It feels like an afterthought either way, and not to be an organic part of the well-balanced setup of bitcoin.
So, to come back to your highway analogy: neither the two-lane highway is the solution here, nor the general four-lane upgrade to it. The correct approach would be one that takes amount of traffic and speed limits, topography and number of weels into account. However, this analysis has not been done by satoshi, and in the discussion climate that is prevalent nowadays, is also not being taken into consideration by anybody else. (The bitpay scaling proposal would have been one such option, bitcoin unlimited another one. But both are being swept under the rug using the "big blocker" catchphrase).
And that's why I will not stop being a shitty complainer.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:21:43
In this context: a directly spendable amount of value. If you have, say, a billion dollars of cash lying around, you can take that with you and spend it on goods and services until it runs out. Given that the amount of value that you yourself own is small compared to the complete size of the market, its value will not strongly fluctuate when you do this.
If, on the other hand, you held the majority stake in a company with a market valuation of 1 billion dollars, or you were holding a vast majority of bitcoins, with a total capitalization of 1 billion dolars, things would be different. If you were to go around and spend all of those, you'd suddenly liquify most of the market. The value would drop significantly with every purchase at you make such that at the end, the total amount of value that you were able to buy is much much lower than 1 billion USD.
Value of an asset (any asset, really) becomes a really nonlinear number as soon as you approach the total amount of that asset in circulation, as opposet to the tangential value of that asset if you only perform miniscule transactions. Hence, comparing the value of one asset's *total* capitalization to some other assets *subset* is comparing apples to oranges.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:05:25
I too will support bitcoin. The chain with the most proof of work determines what bitcoin is, that's the cryptographic truth of the matter.
All other chains I'll actually just ignore.

I'm afraid that second-layer solutions might not pan out to be working, and we'll be stuck with the blockchain as-is.
While it is certainly *working* as a payment system, it is hilariously inefficient (somebody called it "the world's worst datastructure") and scales very very badly.
In this case, Bitcoin won't be going away, but it will also not transform the world in the way we'd all wish it to. And then something else, probably centralized and under commercial control, will continue to provide for the world's financial needs.

I'm already using Bitcoin when shopping for groceries (yay for 2 K-Markets in Helsinki accepting bitcoin), and about 50% of the time it already *is* so friendly that my mother would be able to use it. They key in the amount on their tablet, I scan the QR-Code, it gets confirmed in 2 seconds, all is good.
The other 50% of the time, confirmations take &gt;10 minutes, my phones' bitcoin client doesn't manage to verify the store's signature and refuses to send, or similar mishaps occur.
So, I'd say we are halfway there.
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:40:51
I have the feeling that people in these comments are conflating Segwit2X and btc1 here.
The vast majority of 2X supporters are running a slightly modified core node, with a two-line fix to consensus.h that gives them 8M block weight limit. The number of btc1 nodes on the other hand is really small.
Which means that btc1 behaviour doesn't dictate how the segwit2x fork will behave. So please keep the two apart.
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:33:06
It only requires changing two numbers in src/consensus/consensus.h really. Also reverting commits 5e35cd94c18d81cbcc7fdece484822841ded402c and 1de73f4e19fe789abb636afdb48a165a6fd31009, which do the explicit btc1 abandonment, but I suppose that is no longer neccessary if btc1 doesn't set these bits anymore.

I don't agree with you, but I still upvoted you because I think that is an important discussion that needs to happen.
The nation-state is currently being held in high regard as the supreme formative structure that enforces both stability and civilatiory structure, as well as cultural and moral unity of it's citizens. Nationalists, especially, argue that without the nation state, anarchism and downfall is the inevitable alternative.
At the same time, the actual power wielded by nation states progressively decreases. This is happening both on a political level, where trade agreements and international contracts are increasingly taking legeslative maneuvering space away from the governments, as well as a cultural one. If you look at the European Union for example, it's member states are nowadays primarily administrational entities, simply enacting the european union regulations, while the actual european culture increasingly disregards the map borders, going both more towards regionalism as well as european harmonization.
The same is happening with cultural trends on a global scale, an example being the entire esports and streaming community for which a country is nothing more than a little flag that you put next to your username, typically.
Cryptocurrencies are enacting the same process on the financial world. While news about country X banning bitcoin while country Y praises and supports it are still big headlines for us, the majority of processes that we worry about here are not affected by states at all. The question of block size and transaction format appears to be of bigger impact than the question whether a single country has recently banned bitcoin.
This future outlook of structural reorganization that disregards the borders of nation-states may look scary, since it is uncertain what the regulatory and moral authorities in such a system will turn out to be. But seen from the other direction, the re-nationalization of electronic payments appears much scarier to me.

There's a number of supermarkets in the Helsinki area that allow direct payment with bitcoin already (they have a tablet at the checkouts which is running the bitpay app, seems like they just made up their solution themselves).
In my experience, it works flawlessly about 60% of the time, and leads to confusion and delays the other 40% still, mostly involving the store manager coming by, frowning, double-checking everything an then confirming that everything is ok afterall. So it's good to have a properly coordinated larger-scale setup for this, so that typical problems can be dealt with more professionally.

Pro: if you buy now, and a split occurs, you'll have coins in both chains. So whatever happens, you'll be part of it.

You are barking up the wrong tree here. The problem is not the Emergent Consensus fraction (BU, Bitmain, etc), they are at least trying to push for *some* sort of scaling, be it one you don't approve of.
The actual problem are the miners that are signaling for neither SegWit, *nor* EC. They are basically signalling for "we do not want bitcoin to scale either way".
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:30:26
How is it a binary choice? There's always the third option to follow the "normal" (non-UASF, non-bigblock) chain, as long as the UASF doesn't have a miner majority.
And actually, as long as that is the case, the bigblock hard fork chain won't even be visible.
