TL;DR: you don't want your money supply to cause deflation.

First of all, the PDF on the page you linked to does not seem in any way to reflect mainstream economic thought on currency. Which is fine, everybody is happy to learn about heterodox viewpoints, but you'll have to show how his particular train of though is applicable here. Simply stating "Learning some economics would help", because most of the time they would get some other idea than the one you just linked to.
Anyway, started reading the PDF, and came across this: 


the free market has found gold and silver to be the most efficient


of exchange on the free market—is the only way money can
become established. Money cannot originate in any other
way, neither by everyone suddenly deciding to create money
out of useless material, nor by government calling bits of
paper “money.” For embedded in the demand for money is
knowledge of the money-prices of the immediate past; in
contrast to directly-used consumers’ or producers’ goods,
money must have preexisting prices on which to ground a
demand. But the only way this can happen is by beginning
with a useful commodity under barter, and then adding
demand for a medium for exchange to the previous demand
for direct use (e.g., for ornaments, in the case of gold).1 Thus,
government is powerless to create money for the economy; it
can only be developed by the processes of the free market.
A most important truth about money now emerges from
our discussion: money is a commodity.
To me it seems this guy would never ever dream of calling bitcoin a currency. What am I missing here?
