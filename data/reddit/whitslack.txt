You were correct up until your last sentence. Even after Bitcoin implements a quantum-resistant signature algorithm, any "lost" coins at addresses using the present algorithm (ECDSA) will still be vulnerable to quantum attack.
I like to use the metaphor of shipwrecked gold: it may be a mile under the sea and thus inaccessible to present-day technology, but it's not exactly lost, and some day there will exist the technology to economically bring it back up from the depths. Bitcoins controlled by known keys will be moved to new, quantum-safe addresses before quantum computing advances enough to efficiently crack the old keys, but the bitcoins controlled by lost keys can't be moved before this quantum flag day and thus will be reclaimed through quantum attack.

"Free" was a bit of an overstatement, I'll admit, but the actual fees would *only just* cover the marginal cost of including a transaction in a block — i.e., the fees would only cover the incremental bandwidth and storage requirements and offset the incremental risk of the block being orphaned due to its increased size — with no money left over to actually support the mining operation, which is a fixed cost (not dependent on which transactions are mined).


Transaction fees have never been sufficient to actually support Bitcoin in perpetuity. We are still living on borrowed time, being financed through monetary inflation. If fees don't increase tremendously (on the order of 100× what they are now), Bitcoin will wither on the vine.


I would too, but clearly you see that there is a trade-off here, and so there is an economic "sweet spot" that maximizes the product: price per unit times number of units. If blocks consistently have empty space in them, then this means that users will pay lower and lower fees, until they are only just covering the miners' marginal (per unit) costs but none of the miners' fixed costs. Bitcoin dies at that point because mining power dwindles to nothing.

Looking only at the era of deposit insurance, I'm not joking. You deposit some USD at a financial institution, and you're going to be able to get it back (assuming the government doesn't seize it, but that's a regulatory risk, not a counterparty risk). By contrast, if you deposit some BTC at a financial institution, you very well might not get it back. In short, bitcoiners have a lot more counterparty risk than fiaters.

I suspect that you don't *really* want to know the details of how this would work. Your question is rhetorical because you think I don't have a sensible answer, and you think you're being clever and flippant by cornering me. Well, you aren't; I do have an answer. I know I'm wasting my time, but here goes…
Courts are not statist constructs. What *is* a statist construct is having *only one* court system. The State is a monopoly service provider, the biggest (and most abusive) monopoly ever. Imagine if it weren't a monopoly. Imagine if there were competing service providers, providing the services that most people assume only The State can provide.
Now, maybe you already started down this mental avenue, but then you balked when you got to the part where big companies have more money than you have. That is true, but the conflict isn't between BigCo and you; it's between BigCo's private defense firm and your private defense firm. Do the customers of BigCo's defense firm collectively have more money than the customers of your defense firm? Individuals outnumber corporations by a huge factor.
David Friedman goes into great detail about exactly this scenario. Here's a tiny except addressing your objection:


On the off-chance that you were actually being genuine in asking for more information about how this would work, [here]( you can read the whole chapter about how a society with competing private defense firms and competing courts would function (without violence!).

Based on this description, I would have to conclude that the Core devs are "decent." They don't want to fuck up Bitcoin by centralizing it into the hands of a few.

(That would be a temporary workaround, not a solution, and it would come with risks.)

A parallel question: Is 128-bit AES safe, given that we also have 256-bit AES? The answer is an unqualified yes. The only reason we have 192- and 256-bit AES is that the government wanted multiple tiers of perceived security to apply to its multiple tiers of secret classifications. (Confidential information can be encrypted with any AES key, but Top Secret can only be encrypted with 256-bit.) It's security theater, like much of what the government does. In reality, 128 bits of entropy is more than enough.
Now apply this to Bitcoin. A 12-word seed provides 128 bits of entropy to an EC private key, which is 256 bits wide. Yes, you can use 24 words to get a full 256 bits of entropy, but there is no practical reason to prefer that. (Do you want it to take a million years to guess your private key or a trillion years? The difference is irrelevant in practice.)

Bitcoin *is* cheaper than credit cards unless you're doing very small transactions. You can send a million dollars worth of bitcoins for less than 10 cents.

Corporations couldn't exist in a free market. The very notion of a corporation (an artificial entity constructed to protect certain individuals from the legal consequences of their actions) is contrary to the notion of a free market. Corporate limitations on executives' liability are a grant of the state. In a free market, a company's executives would be *personally liable* for the actions of the company. As a result, companies could not grow so large that the chief executives and directors couldn't keep a watchful eye on everything going on, so as to watch out for their own hides. This legal fiction of the "corporation" is purely a result of crony capitalism (a.k.a. "corporatism") and would not exist under free-market capitalism. (Would you sign a waiver to indemnify and hold harmless the executives of each and every company whose products and services you purchase?

Blocks have to be nearly full in order for the economics of Bitcoin to work. If blocks aren't full, then it means space in a block is not under contention, meaning anyone can take it for free.

Good points. Even still, considering exchange fees, Bitcoin is cheaper than credit cards. At a million-dollar transaction volume, exchanges are going to be granting their lowest fee tiers. Overall fees on both sides are going to total less than 1%. That's less than half what a credit-card costs. And, of course, if you can keep your business entirely in Bitcoin without falling back on the fiat monetary system, you can avoid that cost. This does, as you rightly point out, expose you to exchange-rate risk, which can go in your favor or against you.

"The" mempool? There is no such animal. The buyer can observe a transaction in his/her own mempool, but this does not imply anything about whether the same transaction is also present in the mempools of any miners or which ones.

The reason your credit cards get declined when you're traveling is that your bank thinks your card information has been stolen and duped onto a different card and is being used by a thief in a different part of the world. PINs make it impossible to steal credit-card information and use it elsewhere in this way. If you input your PIN at the point of sale, your bank can be quite confident that it's really you making the transaction and not a thief.
In countries that use chip and PIN, your server brings a terminal to the table, you insert your card, enter a tip amount or choose from a few precalculated tip amounts (if you wish), enter your PIN, and take your card. End of transaction. You can leave. The server never disappears out of sight with your card.

This is a common misconception. Banks don't lend out deposits (well, except maybe certificates of deposit). Rather, deposits are what enable banks to create entirely new money out of thin air that they then loan out at interest. If banks were really lending out the money you deposit with them, then you wouldn't still have that money in your account, and the borrower would have to repay their loan before you could get your deposit back. What actually happens is that your money stays in your account, and the bank conjures into existence brand new money to place into the borrower's account. They can do this because, on the books, this money creation act is zero-sum: the new loan is an asset for the bank, and the new deposit is a liability of the same amount. The only thing that limits how much money the banks can create this way are the regulators whose job it is to keep the whole house of cards from crashing down. But when the regulators become subservient to the banks they're supposed to be regulating, the system is doomed. That's where we are now.

Redeeming a native P2WPKH output doesn't require anything in `scriptSig`. (This fact is what gives rise to the cashtards' misunderstanding/misrepresentation that SegWit outputs are "anyone can spend.") In contrast, redeeming a P2WPKH-in-P2SH output requires embedding in the `scriptSig` a script that pushes the witness version and public key hash. (This is the `redeemScript`, as all P2SH redemptions require.) In a native P2WPKH output, the witness version and public key hash go in the `scriptPubKey` of the *output* rather than in the `redeemScript` of the *input*, whereas a P2WPKH-in-P2SH output's `scriptPubKey` looks like that of any other P2SH output: it contains `OP_HASH160`, the Hash160 of the `redeemScript`, `OP_EQUAL`. The witness of the input is the same in either case.

The first layer of the general Internet (e.g., Ethernet) is also "unusable" for any network larger than a few dozen computers. To scale to global proportions, routing is required. Lightning Network is a routing layer for Bitcoin. The raw blockchain is like Ethernet.

The problem with your conception of this is that an image is a computer file that can exist on computers and be copied around. A bitcoin is not this at all. A bitcoin is an abstract concept, an imaginary piece of property; it doesn't exist as a string of bits that can be copied; it's an immaterial quantity. You couldn't turn an image into that. The closest analog might be something like the *fact* that the Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci. You can't duplicate a fact; it just is.

This more describes Confidential Transactions ("CT").
Schnorr allows multiple inputs to be signed using only one signature, thereby saving space. The inputs and outputs are all still discrete. You could combine Schnorr with CT to achieve a fairly compact way of mixing coins from multiple parties and paying them out in such a manner that the inputs can't be strongly correlated with the outputs.

It's not entirely disingenuous. The block chain has the same capacity limits regardless of the monetary value of a bitcoin. The supply of bitcoins also is unaffected by the monetary value of a bitcoin. If we assume that the velocity of bitcoins too is independent of their monetary value (which is a big assumption that is probably wrong), then moving 0.01 BTC represents the same relative load on the block chain regardless of the monetary value of 0.01 BTC. So if we want to define "spam" as any transaction that "probably shouldn't occur directly on the block chain," then we could set a threshold for transaction value in bitcoins below which a transaction could reasonably be considered spam, and this threshold would be independent of the monetary value of a bitcoin.
As an example, suppose that the block chain can only hold 1000 transactions per day, and assume that all 21M bitcoins are accessible and that each and every bitcoin moves exactly once per day. Then, in order to move all bitcoins exactly once per day, within 1000 transactions, the average transaction value must be 21,000 BTC. If we assume transaction values are normally distributed (they aren't, but for sake of discussion let's say they are) and if we know the standard deviation, then we could reasonably say, "any transaction whose value is less than 6 standard deviations below the mean of 21,000 BTC is spam." If we were to use more realistic numbers, it's entirely reasonable that a statement of this form could boil down to "any transaction of less than 0.01 BTC is spam."

"Forever" may not be entirely correct. Lost bitcoins are more like shipwrecked gold at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. It's presently uneconomical to recover it — recovery would cost more than the treasure is worth — but this may not always be so. Eventually quantum computers will be ubiquitous and powerful, and Bitcoin will have long moved on to quantum-resistant crypto algorithms, but the lost bitcoins will be stuck at plain old ECDSA addresses, which a sufficiently advanced computer might some day be able to crack. And unlike shipwrecked gold, we know exactly where all the lost bitcoins are.

For me it was preservation of wealth. Bitcoin's fixed supply (versus fiat's unlimited supply inflation) was my primary reason for getting involved. The whole fiat monetary system is mathematically unsound, as all fiat currency exists in the form of debt that must be repaid with interest, but the money to pay the interest doesn't exist except as further new debt, so literally the fiat monetary system *requires* perpetual inflation just to stay afloat. No thanks. I choose Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has never been suitable for retail POS transactions. It has always been possible to publish one transaction and then mine a conflicting transaction that invalidates the first.

This strategy has drastically reduced security. Imagine an adversary has 8 of your 12 seed words. Now they only have to brute force 4 words. They'll be able to do that 2048^8 times faster than brute forcing all 12 words. In other words, they could practically and affordably do it.
The safer way to split up your seed words into fractional "shares" is to use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Then an adversary in possession of only some of the shares won't have any information that would speed up a brute force attack. Cryptography is magic sometimes.

Transaction malleability doesn't preclude atomic swaps; it only slows them down. You have to wait for each step of the process to get sufficient confirmations before proceeding to the next step, whereas with SegWit you can blast out the whole protocol without waiting.

You don't have to wait. I've been using SegWit in Bitcoin Core for months. True, it is a little cumbersome, as you have to send all transactions using `sendmany` and manually specify SegWit addresses to receive your change. It's doable, though, and well worthwhile (IMO) for the reduction in fees.

Schnorr signatures will let you efficiently add more funds to an open channel.

The problem with the idea of a "drop" transaction is that no one is obligated to remember or relay your transactions, so they might only relay your original transaction but not your "drop" transaction.

"Consensus-compatible" only means that the software has to enforce the same minimal set of validity rules. It doesn't say anything about what language the software is written in.

If you're using the original Bitcoin wallet (i.e., "Core"), you can use the `abandontransaction` command to immediately make your coins spendable again. Just take care that you then subsequently spend at least one of the previously "used" unspent outputs, so as to invalidate your abandoned transaction.

Lightning is fine for large transactions; you just might have to open a new channel directly to the payee. Doesn't cost any more than an ordinary on-chain transaction, but then the payee can spend the funds back through your new channel to pay others on the Lightning Network, so your paying by opening a new channel has more utility than a plain old on-chain transaction.

Bitcoin Core supports this.

You might want to consult a tax advisor. You absolutely are taxed on the "gains" if your EUR is worth more in USD terms when you spent it than it was when you bought it. There is an exception for small transactions to make things not quite so cumbersome for casual purchases — this is what Bitcoin lacks by not being treated as a foreign currency — but if you were buying a car, then that would not be covered under the exception.

This is a great description of signing using a reversible asymmetric scheme like RSA, but it's not true of DSA (or the elliptic-curve version, ECDSA). ECDSA can't recover (decipher) the original message (digest) from the signature. This is because there is no way to calculate a multiplicative inverse in a group defined over an elliptic curve in a finite field. Instead, the original message (digest) must be known, and the signature can be verified mathematically to have been computed using the private key corresponding to the known public key, without needing to know the private key.

I'm talking about the electricity. An idle CPU consumes significantly less power than a CPU working at full tilt. I don't have the actual numbers, but I would very conservatively bet that $1000 spent on electricity to power a CPU miner might generate $1 worth of bitcoin. It would be more reasonable for a supporter to simply donate $1000 worth of bitcoins than to spend $1000 on electricity to donate $1 worth of bitcoins.

But the problem with that line of reasoning is that a smartphone isn't purpose-built to mine bitcoins. Your argument is like "You might well use your garden trowel to mine gold because you'll get a least a little bit." It's true that you could dig up a few micrograms of gold with a day's worth of digging with your trowel, but it's not an effective use of your labor. Likewise, mining bitcoins on a mobile device is just not going to be an effective use of energy. You'd pay orders of magnitude more for the energy to charge your device than the bitcoins it could mine would be worth.

Eclair Mobile runs the Eclair implementation of the Lightning spec; Eclair is written in Scala. BLW runs the lnd implementation of Lightning; lnd is written in Go.


Maybe. They don't have as much battle testing behind them, so there is a greater chance of bugs that could allow a remote attacker to steal funds. That said, there's a pretty large bug bounty (all the bitcoins in the Lightning Network), and no one has taken it yet.

Lightning Network actually does only work with invoices at present.

The company Coinbase named itself after a technical term, just as Blockchain did. The "coinbase transaction" in each block is the transaction that pays the mining subsidy and fees to the miner. It's special in that it's the only transaction whose output amount is allowed to exceed its input amount. In fact its input doesn't refer to any previous transaction output, and the `scriptSig` is never executed and so is allowed to contain anything. The script has been used to contain signaling markers and other short messages, including the famous "Chancellor on bring of second bailout" message in the genesis block.

That's a fantasy, though. Sure, software can theoretically process thousands of transactions per second, but that's not the bottleneck in blockchain-based currencies. The problem is Internet connectivity. Even at Bitcoin's extremely hampered block size, the Internet connectivity requirements for running a full node are beyond what is available for small businesses and homes in large parts of the world.

Be aware that doing this compromises your privacy. It's really best to avoid combining (i.e., spending in the same transaction) outputs that were sent to different addresses because then you dramatically increase the likelihood (to a blockchain analyzer) that the different addresses belong to the same entity (you). If any of those addresses are ever positively identified, then *all* of them will be. Dusting attacks (sending dust to previously used addresses) are specifically intended to trick people into spending the dust along with an output that was sent to a different address, for exactly the purpose of revealing more information about who might own the previously used address.

While you *could* open a channel directly to the lemonade stand, that wouldn't make a lot of sense unless you intend to do a lot of repeat business with the lemonade stand.

And why would you ever *close* a Lightning channel? The only reasons are because a counterparty tried to cheat you (unlikely, given the punishment you'd deal them for trying) or because you need to pay someone directly on chain (which will become less and less common as LN is adopted).

Fair, although that's not at all what I did.

As a result, I have no Python "virtual environment," all the bits and bobs are installed properly in directories beneath `/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages`, and all installed files are tracked and managed by the system package manager. (I despise language-specific package managers like CPAN, PyPI, NPM, RubyGems, etc. IMHO, all packages should be installed globally by the system package manager so that keeping the system up to date is a one-step affair. Bundled and private copies of libraries encourage outdated versions that may harbor known security vulnerabilities. Removing bundled libraries and using only globally installed libraries ensures that all libraries are kept fully up to date by the system package manager.&lt;/rant&gt;)

@_date: 2019-07-01 05:08:55


In the eventual future the only reason anyone would ever want to *close* a channel would be if their counterparty tried to cheat (intentionally or not). (The software handles this automatically.) In the near term, you might also need to close a channel if you need to free up funds to pay someone who is stuck in the dark ages and hasn't gotten on the Lightning Network yet, but that need will diminish over time.


You should never close a channel except in the aforementioned cases. You can open a new channel with additional capacity, or in a future revision of LN you'll be able to splice more funds into an existing channel. You can also rebalance incoming and outgoing capacity among your open channels.


No. Each channel is independent of all others.


The shop shouldn't be closing channels; that would be counterproductive. The shop should simply be paying its employees and suppliers on LN, or if it must swap bitcoins for fiat, it would deposit bitcoins to an exchange via LN. Closing channels doesn't make sense.


"Withdrawn"? Like, paid to an address that isn't a Lightning channel? Currently no, but again, once splicing is implemented, you could reduce the capacity of a channel and send the difference to whatever address you want (which could be to open a new channel, to splice into another existing channel, or to pay a luddite directly on chain).


Currently that's how it's implemented, but technically a Lightning channel is identified by a transaction hash **and** output number, so in theory you could open multiple channels with a single Bitcoin transaction.


No. You'd buy bitcoins on whatever exchange and withdraw them from the exchange via LN. If you have inadequate incoming capacity, then the exchange would open a new channel to you (or splice more capacity into an existing channel with you) and push your withdrawal to you via that channel.

Your information here is wrong (possibly outdated). The current suggested channel capacity limit is 16777215 sat, but nothing prevents two nodes from agreeing to open a larger channel between themselves, and indeed there are many such larger channels open in LN today.

Ah, of course. I can never remember which is which between "TXID" and "WTXID."

The blockchain is only involved to solve the problem that it was invented to solve: to adjudicate in the case of a dispute. Absent any dispute, there's no need to involve the blockchain.

Even if instant conversions between cryptocurrencies eventually become so commoditized as to be effectively free (rather than subject to non-trivial fees like ShapeShift charges today), there will always be a spread. Look at traditional (fiat) currencies as an example: even if you pay no fee to exchange from one fiat currency to another, you still have to eat the spread. It's always better to avoid a conversion if you can. The same will be true of cryptocurrencies. This is why altcoins are a pointless exercise (aside from beta testing new ideas for Bitcoin).

Right, and there's no reason to ever close the channel under ordinary use. Closing a channel is the recourse you have if you need to settle a dispute. Settling disputes is what the blockchain was invented to do.

Not a bad analogy. Could be extended as follows. If you pick up your chips and take them next door to a different casino, you can play with your same chips there, and that casino will simply bring them back to the first casino later to get the cash (or swap them for some of their own chips that had walked the opposite direction). Maybe the second casino will charge you a trivial fee for using the neighboring casino's chips, whereas you can use the "native" chips without any fee at all. This is similar to how you can send a Lightning payment through a direct channel for free but you have to pay a small fee if you want to route your payment through one or more intermediaries. The point is that this small routing fee is less than it would cost you to set up a new channel with your payee directly. Of course, if you're going to be doing a lot of repeat business, then it may make sense to open a new channel so your transactions will be completely free.

Only capacities of public channels are advertised. The balance on each side of the channels is not advertised, as this would be a privacy leak.
In your scenario, A would not route through N1 to pay B since A already has a direct channel to B.


It is possible to have multiple outgoing payments in progress concurrently. Each such payment is independent of the others.


This is the reason for the "channel reserve." It's to ensure that both parties always have at least a little to lose if they attempt to cheat.
If you actively manage your channels, you can keep them relatively evenly balanced, which maximizes the cost to both parties of being caught at attempting to cheat.

I could sell my widget at a price of 1 or at a price of 1000, and it wouldn't necessarily be any more or less expensive; it just depends on the value of the currency unit I'm using. So is the game that central banks are playing simply to arbitrage the time lag between their devaluing the currency and sticky prices' being adjusted to compensate? If so, then that's incredibly shortsighted and unsustainable. But that describes the whole fiat monetary system, so I guess I shouldn't be so incredulous.

C++3z (standardized in the late 2030s) would look quite different from C++2a (the current draft standard in our present time). Even if the future Bitcoin were written in C++, no compilers or standard libraries today would support the code. The time traveler would have had to reimplement lots of container, utility, and system interface classes in terms of what was available in Boost in 2009, and sweeping changes to the code would be required to back out of language features introduced in C++11 and afterward, such as r-value references, move semantics, and lambdas. It would be such a significant undertaking that it would probably be easier to start over from scratch and reimplement everything in C++03. So yeah, *effectively* it's a different language.

Just his node ID and IP address/port. However, mobile wallets typically cannot accept incoming TCP connections, so opening a channel directly between two mobile wallets may be tricky. Besides, such a channel will almost certainly be unusable for routed payments, meaning it'll only be useful for direct payments between those two mobile wallets. It's usually better for mobile wallets to open channels to routing nodes, which are always online, and perform their payments through those nodes. Some services, like LightningConductor.net, will open a return channel to a node to allow that node to receive incoming payments without previously having sent any outgoing payments. Alternatively, you can use a Lightning-to-blockchain service to send some funds over LN and have them sent back to you on chain (not trustless!); then you'll have some incoming capacity to receive payments via LN.

You should. It's what cryptocurrency should be: fast (no waiting for confirmations), cheap (sub-cent fees for "coffee transactions"), and trustless (no "master nodes" or other gimmicks).


Adoption takes time, as with anything. Setting up a Lightning wallet is not much harder than setting up a vanilla Bitcoin wallet. You install a mobile app, write down your seed words and keep them safe, send some bitcoins to your new wallet on chain, and then use those bitcoins to open a channel or several. Eclair Mobile can pick a random node for you to open a channel with, or you can scan a QR code of someone's node address to open a channel with them specifically. Once your new channel has been confirmed on chain, you're ready to enjoy all the instant payment goodness of Lightning Network.
Note that if you want to *receive* payments to your new mobile Lightning wallet, you'll need some incoming capacity, which you can get by spending some bitcoins through LN. I find an easy way is just to open a channel to a friend and send them some coins through that channel in exchange for their sending you the same amount of coins on chain. Then your Lightning wallet will be ready to receive via LN.

Unfortunately, no. The channel closing fee is always paid by the party that opened the channel, regardless of who initiates the channel closure. This is to guard against an attack mode wherein the attacker can drain the victim of funds by repeatedly: (1) creating a new temporary node, (2) opening a channel to the victim, (3) rotating all possible funds out to the victim's side via circular routes, and then (4) abandoning the temporary node. The victim then has no choice but to perform unilateral closes on the abandoned channels to recover their funds. If the channel closer were to pay the fees, then this would allow the attacker to force the victim to spend all of the victim's money on channel closing fees. If instead the channel *initiator* is always the one who pays channel closing fees, then this attack isn't possible.


Yes, but generally there's no incentive for them to do that since they would have no funds tied up in your channel.

There is an education gap, definitely. It's not immediately obvious to a new user what the best practices are for LN or what to look out for.


At the end of the day, it doesn't much matter whom you connect to. The worst they can do is refuse to route payments for you, in which case your wallet will just try a different route.


No, you don't need to trust nodes in Lightning. Your wallet will automatically punish anyone who tries to cheat you (by taking all funds in your channel with them, even funds that were directed to them). But you do probably want to connect to nodes that will be online all the time, as you can't route a payment through a node that's offline.


Indeed, and you shouldn't have to. You won't, eventually. All the LN channel operations can be automated and will be. It's just that getting all the mechanics working well has taken higher development priority.

That's a pretty misleading "definition" of SegWit. The signatures are still transmitted and stored within the transactions. It's just that legacy nodes aren't served the added "witness" field in the transaction input structure.

There is no such requirement at the network layer. Your replacement transaction can have entirely different outputs. You can even use the replacement to send all funds (minus the fee) back to yourself, effectively "cancelling" your original payment. That's fundamentally why accepting 0-confirmation payments is so risky.
Note that in order to RBF correctly, your replacement transaction must spend at least one of the same UTxOs (unspent transaction outputs) as the transaction it is meant to replace. Otherwise, you have just made two independent transactions, both of which may be confirmed.

That's not the reason for the channel reserve. That channel reserve is there to make sure that both parties always have some skin in the game. If you had nothing left to lose in the most recent channel state (i.e., all funds are set to pay out to your counterparty), then you would have no disincentive to try to cheat by broadcasting with an outdated channel state (that maximizes your payout) the next time you see your counterparty offline. Requiring that you always have some funds in the channel means there will always be a risk to you in trying to cheat.

You haven't met the channel reserve yet. You can't ever completely empty one side of a channel, or else that channel participant would have "no skin in the game" and would be incentivized to try to cheat by broadcasting an outdated state. (The punishment if caught doing so is to forfeit all funds in the channel, which is why peers must always maintain a least a little bit of funds on their side of the channel so that the punishment is effective.) The initial state of the channel at opening, in which *all* funds are on one side, is the exception to the rule, not the norm.
Spend a little more through that channel, and you will be able to receive back through it.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:12:18
That channel would be too small to be useful to either of us anyway, but in theory your node should retry with a larger reserve specified, so as to exceed my node's dust limit. Often nodes simply compute the reserve as a fixed fraction of the channel capacity, so simply trying again with a higher capacity would likely cause your node to compute and specify an acceptable reserve.

That's a question I won't answer, but I will say that the answer may not be as relevant as you might think. What's more important than how many bitcoins you have in your JoinMarket wallet is whether those bitcoins spend most of their time in a confirmed state or in an unconfirmed state. If most of your coins are unconfirmed most of the time, then it means you don't have enough coins to meet current demand for CoinJoins. If most of your coins are confirmed most of the time, then you are meeting demand, and having more coins in your wallet wouldn't yield any more income for you.

You don't have to stop the daemon while installing the new one. Linux keeps actively referenced inodes on disk even if all directory entries pointing to them have been removed from the file system. (This is why you are able to `rm` the last link to an executable image even while it's mapped into a running process.) As soon as you stop the daemon, the old executable will be deallocated on disk. The new executable will already be referenced by the same path name as the old executable was previously. The upshot of all of this is that you can install the new version over the old version and then simply restart the daemon. Total downtime of just a few seconds.

The reason it's a rule of thumb and not a scientific theory is that it's not quantifiable. "Ten times better" is a rhetorical device, not a benchmark.

The hash power is what matters. It's obvious with a simple mental exercise. Imagine two blockchains: today's Bitcoin, with its 10-minute block interval, and a shitcoin called Awesomesauce that has a 15-minute block interval. Only a handful of miners are mining Awesomesauce, so its difficulty is quite low to maintain its 15-minute block interval. Would you contend that one confirmation on the Awesomesauce chain provides more security than one confirmation on the Bitcoin chain, simply because Awesomesauce's block interval is longer? One Bitcoin mining pool could rewrite 1000 blocks of the Awesomesauce chain in under a minute. What secures a transaction in the blockchain is the *amount of work* stacked atop it.

They are exact, but there is still change. You can only spend whole UTxOs in Bitcoin. It's like little gold bars. If you only have a 1-ounce bar, a 2-ounce bar, and a 5-ounce bar, and you need to spend half an ounce, then you need to split the 1-ounce bar in half and spend half of it while you keep the other half. Bitcoin works exactly like that. You can split your "bars" of Bitcoin very *exactly* (down to eight decimal places of precision), but you'll still have part of a "bar" (UTxO) that you have to give to yourself. My question is whether the measure of Bitcoin transaction volume quoted in the OP refers to the total amount of UTxOs being *spent* or the total amount being *received* (not as change to the sender). Since there's no foolproof way of determining which output is payment and which is change, I think it unlikely that any statistic could incorporate only the payments and not the change, and such a statistic would not be comparable to Visa or PayPal.

Your imagination is limited.

There are lots of potential ways the new coins could be implemented without breaking existing functionality. For example, the coinbase for the new coin could be embedded in the coinbase for the original coin.

It was 3-4 years ago, but they were state of the art then. No wear-leveling algorithm can solve the problem of simply writing too much. A 256-GB drive with MLC flash can withstand about 256 TB of lifetime writes, assuming wear-leveling is working perfectly and there is zero write amplification caused by partially rewriting erase blocks. Even under these unrealistically optimistic assumptions, sustaining writes at 100 MB/s continuously will yield an expected lifetime of just under 30 days. Spinning media won't wear out for years under that workload.

Just so you're aware: it doesn't let you read individual files from the drive; it operates at the block level, so you have to give it a blank drive that's at least as large as the damaged one, and it'll try its best to make the new drive a clone of the original.

"Opt-in" RBF is a farce for another reason besides the one that mentioned. Nothing prohibits a miner from replacing *any* transaction in their mempool if it's worthwhile to them. The replaced transaction does not need to have been flagged as "eligible for replacement by fee." The only thing the "opt-in" RBF flag does is change the default relay and mining policies for replacement transactions. Nodes and miners are free to use different policies, including ignoring the flag.

RBF actually damages Lightning severely in that opening a channel now cannot be assumed to succeed at zero confirmations. In other words, when you try to buy your coffee drink, if your wallet can't find a suitable route through the Lightning Network, then you'll have to open a new channel and wait for it to confirm before you'll be able to use the channel to pay the coffee shop. This cripples one of the main use cases for Lightning.

It's actually *not* as simple as that. If your node is introducing more than the average amount of relay latency, then the existence of your node is actually *harming* the network. Granted, not every node can be better than average, by definition, but anyway it's a fallacy to assume that you're helping just by being there.
A real reason to run a full node is so you know — to the extent that you can trust your own hardware and the source from which you obtained the software — that the Bitcoin transactions you're receiving obey the rules as you have agreed to them.

What isn't priced in is that the supply production is going to be cut far more than in half at first. While it's true that miners do foresee the halving coming, what is being overlooked here is that they won't continue mining when it becomes unprofitable, which it will be the instant revenues are cut in half. When a significant fraction of mining power goes offline, blocks will be coming at much greater intervals than every 10 minutes. So in addition to the blocks producing only half as many new bitcoins apiece, the blocks themselves will be coming more slowly.
One might naïvely believe that this drastic reduction in new supply production will cause the price to rise significantly, but realistically, demand will fall too because Bitcoin will be in a time of uncertainty, with long and growing transaction backlogs due to the markedly increased block intervals.
Consider, if 95% of the mining power is unprofitable at 12.5 BTC per block (not an unreasonable guess), then the block interval will increase from 10 minutes to 200 minutes at the halving. Even if we have 8 MB blocks by then, blocks will be completely full, and there will be a persistent and growing transaction backlog. This will persist until the difficulty readjusts downward, which may take up to 27 weeks due to the slower rate at which blocks will be arriving.

Not true. Mining will only be cut in half if half of current miners are earning more than 50% profits. But this is quite unrealistic. In reality, a very few miners are stealing electricity and the rest are much less than 50% profitable. All miners who are earning less than 50% profits (which is almost all of them) will shut down at the halving until difficulty falls or price rises.

A zero-conf channel opening is just as unreliable as any other zero-conf transaction. In a world where RBF is implemented, you won't be able to trust zero-conf channels.

You're the one making the claim, so the burden of proof is on you. It isn't realistic to think that we could consume our way out of a recession, since overconsumption is what got us into it. An economy grows richer when it defers consumption, as this allows long-term capital-improvement projects to complete successfully. Artificially suppressed interest rates (such as central banks create) send the signals of deferred consumption, but there is no actual savings, so the long-term projects ultimately fail due to lack of real resources, and the resources they've already consumed are thus wasted.

It's not possible unless every Ethereum node is also a full Bitcoin node with a full transaction index. Is that in the Ethereum specification? And even if an Ethereum script has access to the Bitcoin block chain, it couldn't sign a Bitcoin transaction without the private key embedded in the Ethereum script. And if that key is there, then it's been publicly disclosed, and someone will just steal the funds out before the Ethereum script ever triggers.

Yeah, and this assumes that the alt with the shorter block interval has the same hashpower building its chain as Bitcoin has. Immutability isn't about how many blocks are stacked on top of your transaction; it's about how many real-world *resources* (e.g., hashes) went into those blocks. You could have an altcoin with a 10-minute block interval, but 6 blocks on that altcoin's chain would be a pittance compared to 6 blocks on Bitcoin's chain.

FSS-RBF isn't appreciably more efficient than CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) because replacing a transaction using FSS-RBF always requires adding at least one input and one output, as does posting a child transaction using CPFP.
There isn't much reason to add FSS-RBF since we already have CPFP. It would be worthwhile to add full RBF, as it is the most efficient mechanism for revising unconfirmed transactions, but a lot of people don't like it because it makes vanilla zero-confirmation transactions completely unreliable, whereas today they are only probabilistically unreliable.

If we admit the possibility that there could be a game-theoretical reason that miners might want to mine maximally sized blocks, then we must anticipate that this will happen.
The argument that "blocks won't be full" makes an assumption that could potentially be false: namely that miners prefer smaller blocks, all else being equal. If ever there is discovered a reason for miners to prefer larger blocks, then miners will make blocks as large as the hard limit will allow.

It doesn't exactly round. The vending machine can only track credit in increments of 5¢. If your payment is worth $1.99, then you will see a credit of $1.95 on the machine. If you then buy a $1.50 item, the machine will "dispense" change of 45¢, and the Vending Pi will send change in bitcoins worth 49¢. In other words, the discrepancy is tracked internally.
As a separate issue, just because your mobile wallet thinks it's sending $2.00 worth of bitcoins doesn't mean the Vending Pi will think it's receiving $2.00 worth of bitcoins. The two apps may be using different price sources.

Okay, I'll agree with that. However, one of the responses to the concern that a 20MB step could trigger an unforeseen failure mode is that a correction could be applied quickly if necessary, but such a correction would itself be a "spontaneous hard-fork," with all the associated dangers.

I'm with Wladimir on this point: it's inappropriate for the Bitcoin Core maintainer (or even a consensus of the Bitcoin Core committers) to accept or reject consensus-rules-changing BIPs. Bitcoin Core is a software implementation of the Bitcoin block-chain consensus rules and peer-to-peer network protocol. Bitcoin Core does not *define* the rules; it merely *implements* them.
It's a tragedy that we actually have no explicit, written definition of the consensus rules and only an approximately correct and informal written definition of the network protocol. Ever since I discovered Bitcoin four years ago, I've been griping that there ought to be IETF RFCs describing comprehensively and exhaustively the Bitcoin block-chain format, script validation and consensus rules, and peer-to-peer network protocol, but every time I bring it up, a core developer glibly replies that the Bitcoin Core source code *is* the specification. But I object to this; an implementation cannot serve as a specification.

1. Cheap electricity and 20Mbps Internet connectivity often do not coincide at the same location. Miners located next to geothermal power plants may not have very fast Internet connectivity.
2. A majority subset of miners could build a fast private network among themselves, within which they would share blocks they've found, and they would only upload those blocks to the rest of the network (and the other miners) after a delay. This strategy allows them to waste the hashing resources of the other miners and ensure a much greater proportion of blocks for themselves. It works even with today's 1-MB limit, but it would be easier to disguise the subterfuge under pretenses of much larger blocks.

The next Bitcoin halving is going to be very interesting to watch.

This could mean that our average block interval grows closer to an hour until the difficulty readjusts, and the readjustment will take much longer than two weeks because we'll be producing blocks so slowly.

I appreciate your arguments and agree with each one, although I think you may be assuming a false dichotomy: I need not pick only one side of the fork; I can run both versions of the software and require anyone who pays me to pay me on both sides of the fork. Granted, this will become an increasingly onerous task as one side of the fork fails, and eventually I will have to cease making this demand.

@_date: 2015-06-09 04:51:23


That would be bad for the old-coiners too, as old addresses would not differentiate bitcoins (valid on both chains) from corecoins (valid only on the Core chain).


The whole point of my post here is that this assumption may not prove correct. We may have to endure dual chains for a while, and using Bitcoin is going to be aggravating during that time unless we figure out ways to smooth the wrinkles.


This is the common logic flaw that I'm trying to address in this post. It's not true that there will be just two coins. It *would* be true *if* it were possible to spend a pre-fork output in such a way that it could definitely not be mined on one of the two chains, but in reality, any post-fork transaction redeeming only pre-fork outputs could be mined on both chains, so you cannot treat the two chains as independent.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:03:21
Batching also means fewer outputs. Send to 10 addresses in one batch, and you only need to create one change output. Send to 10 addresses individually, and you have to create 10 change outputs.
Since batching reduces both the number of inputs and the number of outputs for a given set of payments, it effectively allows more economic activity per block. A higher average number of inputs and outputs per transaction translates to less overhead in the block (all the parts of the transactions that aren't inputs and outputs), which means more inputs can fit into the block, which means more data can be shoved into the witness part of the block that old software doesn't see.

AFAIK, the "flag" is just whether the sequence number is less than the maximum possible sequence number. If it is, then the transaction is eligible to be replaced.

Note, however, that miners can always choose to ignore the flag and replace an "ineligible" transaction regardless.

If a transaction is not valid, then nodes will not accept it. Therefore, your "transaction request" is an irrelevant concept, as any invalid "transaction request" could exist only on the node that originated it. Any valid "transaction request" is simply a transaction. Transactions are transactions, whether they're in the memory pool or the block chain. The Bitcoin protocol has no notion of "transaction request."

Someone else, typically. Merchants contract with a payment processor, which provides (sells or leases) the terminals to the merchant. The payment processor then receives all the transaction details from the merchant's terminals and submits them to the credit-card processing networks, which in turn relay them to the card-issuing banks.
Apple Pay is a different way for consumers to communicate their payment card details to the terminals, but all the rest of the processing chain remains the same. In order to switch to a blockchain-based solution, Apple would have to control the software on the terminals, but they don't; the payment processors do, and they're not going to give up their bread and butter.

The fear is that there may be a game-theoretic incentive for miners to make maximally sized blocks (filling them with garbage if necessary). In this case, blocks WILL instantly become 20 MB as soon as the advantage is discovered.
If there's an advantage to be had by generating maximally sized blocks, it's only a very slight advantage at 1 MB — so slight that probably no one has discovered it. With a 20-MB maximum, any advantage could be significant indeed. With a 20-MB step increase, we won't know if there's an advantage until it's too late.

Your comment demonstrates a lot of technical knowledge, but you're missing some crucial bits. Linux has a block-layer ioctl, `BLKDISCARD`, that physically discards a span of sectors on a block device. What "discard" means varies by device. For thinly provisioned storage devices, discarding blocks releases them back to the free pool. For loop devices, discarding blocks punches them out of the backing file, if the underlying file system supports sparse files. For flash devices, discarding blocks informs the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) controller that those blocks are no longer in use and thus their contents may be discarded. FTLs may or may not immediately erase the discarded pages, but most modern ones will thereafter return all zeros for blocks in the discarded pages. (The Linux kernel has a device flag, `discard_zeroes_data`, that indicates whether the device exhibits this behavior.) The implementation of `mkfs` for most Linux file systems (definitely ext4 and f2fs, the two file systems used for `userdata` in Android phones) have been updated to issue the `BLKDISCARD` ioctl on the entire block device before writing the superblock, inode tables, and any other statically allocated structures in the file system. The call only takes a moment to complete, even for multi-gigabyte devices, since it's just setting flags in the FTL's translation table.

There have never been any such issues with TCP because it was carefully planned to scale from the very beginning. There have been a few "soft forks" in TCP over the years to improve performance, but they've always been backward- and forward-compatible (which is what makes them "soft").
IP, on the other hand, was not designed to scale to an "Internet of Things," and so we're in the middle of a hard fork to IPv6. The fork has been going on for over a decade, and we're still nowhere even close to completing the transition. Anyone who wants to adopt IPv6 now still can't give up IPv4, or they'd be cut off from most of the Internet. Hard forks are messy.

What's being rammed through here? The devs are changing the default free transactions quota for new miners. Miners have always been able to set this parameter to zero, and existing miners will keep it at wherever they had it set. At worst, what is being "rammed through" is an expression of the consensus opinion of the core devs that it no longer makes sense for miners to include free transactions. It is not a mandate or a prohibition. Miners can continue including free transactions if they have been and can continue not including free transactions if they haven't been.

Your quote (from Wikipedia, AFAICT) confirms what I said. If the exchange rate between the two currencies is fixed by government decree, then people will prefer to spend whichever currency is really worth less than the fixed ratio (while the other currency is worth more and thus is better to be hoarded).
Gresham's Law was particularly applicable when the U.S. government was defining a "dollar" both as 1/20th of a troy ounce of gold and as 371.25 grains of silver. Since gold and silver are independent commodities, each with their own independent supply and demand, there is no way to force their actual market values into a fixed ratio, so when the government tried to fix their exchange rate, people tended to spend whichever one was being overvalued by the government's fixed exchange rate and hoard whichever one was being undervalued. Gold and silver swapped places as the popularly preferred medium of exchange several times, as gold's and silver's market values fluctuated independently, before bimetallism was finally abandoned.

Interested in this assertion. When a recession hits, the central bank will again slash interest rates to zero to try to juice up the economy (which, frankly, is already on intensive-care life support). With new bonds being issued at absurdly low interest rates, existing bonds paying higher coupon rates will appreciate in value. So how will bonds get "crushed"? Now, certainly, I would want to sell my bonds before the central bank starts raising interest rates again, but that could be an indeterminate amount of time after the crash.

*If* such an advantage exists, then it's quite likely that there hasn't been sufficient motivation to find it because the advantage would be small at present, as the difference between the natural block size and the maximum block size is presently small.

Channel closeouts in eltoo have two stages: an update stage and a settlement stage. The two stages are separated in time by a time lock. If either party starts trying to close out the channel in an earlier state (i.e., they broadcast an outdated update transaction), then the other party will have a predetermined amount of time in which to broadcast a later channel state (a newer update transaction), which will preclude the first party from completing the closeout (i.e., broadcasting the settlement transaction) of the channel in the earlier state.

What if opening a channel requires *both* sides of the channel to tie up equal amounts of funds? For instance, you open a channel with BitPay and put 100 mBTC into the channel.

Now that the channel is open, you and BitPay can update the channel to shift the payouts in either direction, as your business transactions dictate.

Yes, eventually. But prices are sticky (they resist change), so it could take a while before prices would climb to levels at which these miners could again mine profitably. In the meantime, if someone were to carry out an attack on Bitcoin (enabled by the drastically reduced mining power securing the block chain), then they could possibly collapse confidence in Bitcoin overall, and in that case the price might *never* rise high enough to make mining profitable again. Like I said, this will be interesting to watch.

If they *do* get the big IPO money, though, then they'll be very dangerous. They'll fork Shitcoin Trash to make it proof-of-stake and stop mining the PoW chain, thereby all but killing it off. Then, with their resources freed up from mining BTrash, they'll put all their miners to work on the BTC chain. The sudden influx of capital from the IPO could give them the extra push they need to get over 50% control of BTC mining, at which point they'll start playing games to infuriate BTC users in the hopes of winning people over to their PoS shitcoin.

It could be correct, but it's not. Bitcoin uses a "hash target," which is a 256-bit integer. The hash of the completed block header must be lower than the hash target to be valid. This means the hash must have at least as many leading zero bits as the hash target, but if it has the same number of leading zero bits, then it must be numerically less than the hash target.
For example, the hash target might be `00001011…`. A block hash of `00001101…` would not satisfy the target, whereas a block hash of `00001010…` would satisfy the target, even though all three numbers have four leading zero bits.

It wouldn't happen this way. Btrash is evidence of this point.

I would much prefer to see all income taxes (regardless of source) eliminated and for the government to collect its operating revenues by a consumption tax, à la the "FairTax." Making this change would eliminate the distortion you pointed out and also the distortion that incentivizes individuals to purchase health insurance through their employer (as part of a compensation package) rather than being a direct consumer and shopping for the best deal directly. (Health insurance as employee compensation is not taxed at all, but buying health insurance directly as an individual must be done with after-tax dollars, so there is a distortion there.)

You're correct, but what you prescribe is impossible, at least in the near to intermediate term. Most commodities have natural dampers on their price cycles because rising prices trigger increased production, thereby increasing supply relative to demand, thereby putting downward pressure on the price. Bitcoin is different because there is no way to increase the rate of its production, so there are no "brakes" on a rising price.

My thoughts too. I think just looking at volume (in a common unit, whether that's USD or BTC or something else) is a better way to compare the relevance of various coins.

The real, useful metric for comparing coins would be how much people are spending (in exchange fees) to trade them, but we can't get those figures.

Correct. Thus far, the Two Generals' Problem is unsolved, and I strongly suspect there is no solution. The block chain and the concept of proof of work do not solve the problem; it is still impossible for the two generals together to atomically change state from "do not attack" to "attack" if the communication medium connecting them is unreliable. In the context of Bitcoin, it is still possible that you may receive a block containing a transaction that pays you, even though the rest of the network receives a different block, in which the same bitcoins are sent somewhere else. A sufficiently resourceful attacker could prevent your node from ever discovering the deception. However, the probability that they could continue preventing you from learning the truth decreases as time progresses until eventually it becomes practically impossible that you would not suspect something amiss.

What makes marriage special to me is continuing to stay together not because splitting up would be legally inconvenient but because you actually want to be together. It means so much more when a partner stays with you because they want to, not because they "have" to.

The problem with proof-of-stake is that it's not a consensus algorithm. There is no incentive for miners to converge toward a single consensus. In proof-of-work, a miner can only dedicate his hashing power to mining atop a single block; he cannot use the same hash cycles to mine on multiple alternative chains. Thus, proof-of-work converges to a consensus as a natural consequence of physical scarcity. Proof-of-stake does not have this scarcity, as a miner has coin age on all parallel chains and can "mine" on all of them concurrently. Thus, there is no force driving a proof-of-stake system toward consensus. In short, it's not a solution to the distributed consensus problem.

That's just Vitalik Buterin's hypothesis. In reality, Satoshi could have chosen to start at 100 BTC per block, effecting a cap of 42 million bitcoins, and that also would have been within the integer range of double-precision floating point.

Bitcoin will fall in price during a recession for the reason that people are leveraged in fiat currencies more than they are leveraged in bitcoin. The deleveraging that accompanies a recession requires repaying loans, which are mostly denominated in fiat currencies, meaning bitcoins (and all other assets) will be sold for fiat currencies, thereby pushing down their prices. Just about the only asset class that won't tank in price will be bonds, since their price moves inversely with interest rates, which fall in a recession. However, because central banks artificially push interest rates even lower than they should be, inflation occurs, meaning that even bonds, despite not losing nominal value (i.e., price), will still be losing real value. So really there's no safe haven in a recession.

Almost all of the printed money has ended up back at the central bank in the form of "excess reserves," on which the Fed began paying interest at the same time as it moved to zero interest-rate policy (ZIRP).

Bitcoin is very much still in beta! That doesn't mean it's not used in real-world applications; it only means that the developers aren't confident that all the bugs have been worked out.
One of the strongest arguments against renumbering Bitcoin Core to version "17" was that it would signal that Bitcoin is "out of beta," given that version numbers below 1.0 traditionally indicate beta status. It seems, though, that a critical mass of developers believe it's time, as (last I heard) the next major release of Bitcoin Core will be numbered "17" rather than "0.17".

No **one** should have the power. In a decentralized system such as Bitcoin, **all** participants should have the power to decide which rules they'll accept and which they won't. (Of course, if they choose rules that are very rare, then they must accept that they'll be unable to conduct business with most other people.)
Maybe the question simply needs to be reframed. The Bitcoin Core maintainer(s) could make a decision about whether *Bitcoin Core* will implement a given BIP, but to declare universally that a given BIP is "accepted" or "rejected" may actually not ever be appropriate. Granted, if Bitcoin Core implements a consensus-changing BIP and another implementation doesn't, then the block chain will fork. This is equivalent to the scenario being discussed presently: Bitcoin XT would be an alternative implementation that accepts the BIP while Bitcoin Core rejects the BIP.
**Edit/Addendum:** Technically, even standards-track IETF RFCs are not ever "accepted by The Internet." They are standards proposals — "Requests for Comment." So I'm not sure BIPs could ever be "accepted by Bitcoin." They could only be implemented (or not implemented) by various Bitcoin implementations, of which Bitcoin Core is the seminal one.


This applies just as truly to the hard-fork presently being proposed.

If Bitcoind already has at least 8 established connections (initiated in either direction), then it will cease trying to establish more connections since there's really no benefit (to you) from being connected to more nodes, and actually additional connections would just increase the overall load on the network. Bitcoind will still accept inbound connections from other nodes, however, since more nodes in the network are capable of connecting outbound than accepting inbound. Also, SPV nodes need to connect outbound, so you're helping them out by accepting inbound connections, but you'd be doing them a disservice if you filled up your 125-connection limit with outbound connections to other full nodes.

Good point. I actually do agree with Mike Hearn about one thing: in the absence of an informal social consensus over how to proceed, the block chain grants us the means to achieve the next best thing: a mathematical social consensus. He and Gavin are proposing effectively to put the decision to a vote, and may the best chain win. My concern is that they may be underestimating the damage that a contentious hard fork could deal to the Bitcoin ecosystem. They keep asserting that "there will not be two chains," but with only a 75% majority requirement for the fork to activate, there most definitely could be two active chains, and that could be devastating for Bitcoin.

I would bet that Circle will have one price, not a spread, but their price will be higher than the ask price on Bitstamp. This means you'll be able to buy $100 worth of bitcoins on Circle and then sell them back for $100 on Circle, but if you were to send them to your Bitstamp account, you wouldn't be able to sell them for anywhere near $100.
Circle might be a lucrative channel for selling bitcoins acquired elsewhere, though. I suspect their business model is based on the assumption that more people will be buying bitcoins through them (what they call "depositing") than selling bitcoins through them ("withdrawing"). I would not be surprised if they impose limits on how many bitcoins you can sell but not on how many you can buy, specifically to mitigate the effect of people arbitraging their inflated exchange rate.

The machine buys bitcoins from an exchange (of the operator's choosing) as the customer inserts bills.

How is "locking" bitcoins to USD different from selling bitcoins for USD? How is "unlocking" bitcoins from USD different from buying bitcoins with USD? This seems like misdirection and obfuscation of what is really going on. Coinapult seems like a bitcoin broker with no customer-facing fiat banking system interface: you can sell your bitcoins to them for dollars, but then you can't actually withdraw those dollars; you can only use them to buy bitcoins back from Coinapult in the future. It's fine if this is the case — there's nothing inherently shady about this business model — but Coinapult seems to be trying to disguise what is going on with hand-wavy language.

By "supply," I mean the total amount of the commodity that is available to be called away from its current owner (if a sweet enough offer were to be made). The global supply of gold consists of all the gold in vaults and private collections but does not include shipwrecked gold or gold yet to be mined out of the ground. Similarly, the global supply of bitcoin consists of all the bitcoins in wallets but does not include bitcoins whose keys are lost or bitcoins yet to be mined. The key difference between gold and bitcoins — and what makes the bitcoin price behave so differently — is that the rate at which gold is mined out of the ground increases when the gold price is high, but the rate at which bitcoins are mined is (roughly) constant.

This assumes that the apparent volume in the MtGox era wasn't mostly manufactured by Mark Karpeles. I suspect he figured out that MtGox controlled the market price of Bitcoin and that he could manipulate the price with fake trades to enable himself to buy low and sell high. But then other exchanges started rising to prominence, and traders started arbitraging against the fake trades on MtGox, and this caused a massive drain on MtGox's deposits. Karpeles wasn't smart enough to realize that manipulating the market with fake trades can only lose money in the presence of arbitrage, and he rode that pony all the way into the ground.

How many merchants are going to be accepting the rapidly depreciating national fiat currency when they could be accepting bitcoins instead? Bitcoin will render any Basic Income worthless.
We can look at minimum wage as a corollary to basic income. A minimum wage forces a revaluation of the currency system so that whatever the minimum wage is, it is equivalent in value to a basic, bottom-rung job. For example, if we were to make the minimum wage $20/hr, then $20 would become equivalent in value to one hour of flipping burgers. Extending this to basic income, let's say that basic income is $50/day. In that case, $50 becomes equivalent to the value of no work at all. In other words, dollars become worthless.

This is true, but copycoins don't have substantial objective advantages to a majority of the users. The only way Bitcoin will be unseated as the dominant cryptocurrency will be if there's a new cryptocurrency that is vastly superior to Bitcoin, just as the only reason Bitcoin will unseat fiat currencies is that it is vastly superior to them. Dogecoin (and other copycoins) are not vastly superior to Bitcoin. Maybe they're slightly superior, but this edge is not enough to overcome the network effect.

Neither. All the money is "put into the box" in a single transaction. The buyer contributes one/some input(s), and the seller contributes (an)other input(s). All inputs need to be signed. Buyer and seller can contribute their signatures in either order. Once all signatures are collected, the transaction can be broadcast to the network.

It would be crazy to embed every individual trade, contract, property deal, public record, etc., directly in the blockchain. We don't need to retain hundreds of thousands to millions of redundant copies in that level of detail for the rest of eternity. The blockchain is the base layer, suitable for recording commitments to roll-ups (mathematical summaries) of arbitrarily deep and broad structures. Detailed records may be kept off-chain (with less extreme levels of storage redundancy), and tiny hashes of these records may be embedded in the blockchain to guard against covert revisions.

This is only a prohibition against the individual States' passing legal tender laws on anything other than gold and silver. It does not *require* them to make gold and silver legal tender; it merely *allows* them to do so. Also, this is not a prohibition on the *federal* government's declaring something other than gold and silver as legal tender. Federal Reserve Notes are legal tender under federal law, and this is (regrettably) not a violation of the Constitution.
**Addendum:** It should be noted that the Enumerated Powers section of the Constitution does *not* grant the federal government the power to print paper currency, only the power "To coin Money" and to "regulate the Value thereof." Arguably, this is why the Federal Reserve is a private corporation, because the federal government cannot legally create paper money.

You put that many nodes around even a commercial-grade infrastructure-mode Access Point, and no one will be able to get any packets through. I've seen it happen with lower node density than seen in OP's photo. 802.11's collision detection and avoidance features just aren't good enough to handle nodes so densely packed. In fact, one of the key improvements in WiMax over Wi-Fi was the introduction of a TDMA (time-division multiple access) scheme, much like DOCSIS cable modem use, to avoid the problem of stations constantly talking over each other. When everyone is talking at the same time, no one can be heard. Throughput goes to zero.
Now eliminate the infrastructure and switch to mesh. The problems are compounded a hundred times, as now you have differing delay characteristics, differing transmission powers and receiver sensitivities, hidden and exposed node problems. It's hard enough to solve all these problems in a lightly populated mesh, but thousands of nodes all within range of each other? That's a nightmare.

The win is less about about CC fees, which, as you point out, are relatively insignificant. It's more about chargebacks. A brick-and-mortar store may have to inflate its prices by 10% or more to cover chargebacks.

You have it backwards. If the machine also buys bitcoins (and dispenses cash), then it *always* must have cash in it. If it only sells bitcoins, then the operator can completely empty it of cash regularly.
Also, I think you might not understand something about how two-way ATMs work: the bill acceptor has a separate bill stacker from the bill dispenser. The two are not connected inside the machine. At best, the two-way unit would save its operator from having to take as much cash to the bank every day, as the operator could recycle some of it to fill the bill dispenser.

I'll offer an opposing theory. In a truly free market, wherein no externally imposed regulations erect barriers to entry, no single organization can grow very large because individual actors within that organization will always split off to form competing organizations. They may do this because of differences of opinion, desire for more control over operations, profit motive, or many other reasons. A free market doesn't support monopolies. Monopolies can exist only when there are significant barriers to entry that prevent or discourage the natural fracturing of large companies into smaller ones. This is precisely why large companies lobby the government for increased regulations on themselves. (They know such regulations make it impossible for dissident internal factions to split off.)

Here's a nice way to think of Bitcoin transactions. It's as though you have a coin purse full of gold bars of various sizes. You want to spend 2 grams of gold, but your smallest bar is 3 grams. What do you do? Well, through the magic of Bitcoin, you can take your 3-gram bar, melt it down, and cast two new bars: a 2-gram and a 1-gram. You spend the 2-gram bar and put the 1-gram bar back in your purse. Unlike with gold, this all happens instantly, at no cost, and you don't need to carry around bulky metallurgy equipment.

No need for a majority. Only a tiny minority of people now use gold, with the vast majority preferring inflationary fiat currency systems. Does this fact alone make gold inflationary? No. If a majority decide to change Bitcoin so that it becomes inflationary, then they will cause a hard fork. Those of us who still want a finite-supply Bitcoin will continue on the original fork, and our money will immediately start to gain value versus the new, inflationary "Bitcoin." It would be nice if the new currency would be given a different name, but I would expect it to continue using the name "Bitcoin." We die-hards using the original rules would probably have to start specifying "original Bitcoin" or "Satoshi's Bitcoin" or maybe even a new name like "Satoshicoin."

Nothing compels a person to accept U.S. dollars in sales transactions. However, if you are owed a debt, regardless of in what type of asset the debt is denominated, and the debtor offers you legal tender (e.g., dollars) as repayment of the debt, and you refuse the legal tender, then the debtor can go to a judge and have the debt expunged. So in other words, legal tender laws apply only to repayments of debts, not to ordinary exchanges of money for goods and services. This is why dollar bills say, "This note is legal tender for all *debts*, public and private." (emphasis mine)

So a [mobile virtual network operator]( is not really virtual because it's really a network operator. A virtualized computer (e.g., VMware) is not really virtual because it's really a computer. A virtual private network (VPN) is not really virtual because it's really a private network.
"Virtual" just means lacking a physical manifestation. An MVNO has no physical infrastructure of its own, as it uses another network's towers, radio antennas, and cables. A virtual computer has no physical hardware of its own, as it uses a host computer's hardware. A virtual private network has no physical equipment to itself, as it piggybacks on another network. A virtual currency has no physical notes or specie, as it manifests entirely as a collection of data signals in a computer system.

Both Blockchain.info and Blockr.io run pre-0.9 versions of Bitcoind and therefore will reject any transaction that contains an OP_RETURN output.

There has been a miscommunication apparently. I am saying, the Lamassu machine is a machine that sells bitcoins by taking in paper currency. Or, stated from the other perspective: it allows a customer to buy bitcoins by inserting paper currency.
This means that the machine starts out with no cash in it. Then some customers insert cash throughout the day. Then the operator empties all the cash from the machine at the end of the day. Thus, the machine will only ever have as much as one day's worth of cash in it. Contrast this to a legacy ATM, which gets *filled* with cash every day (or however often). The Lamassu machine has next to no cash in it by comparison.

Umm, the communications infrastructure is all privately owned, from satellites to telephone poles to fiber-optic cables. No need for government there either.
"Muh roads" will be one of the last holdouts of legitimacy for centralized governments, but eventually transportation will be decentralized too. There are already examples of privately owned expressways that are kept in much better shape than the government-managed roads. As the technology for micro-payments evolves, the granularity of road ownership will increase until it's totally seamless that your car makes a micro-payment every time you turn off of one road onto another. This might be 50 years out, but it must happen, or else humanity will have entered another Dark Ages. (A bright future has no room for the inefficiencies of centralized control.)

I can't speak with any first-hand authority on the matter, but my understanding of the situation is that Nefario did return all of GLBSE's customer funds that he had in his possession. However, those funds amounted to only a paltry fraction (5%, IIRC) of the total. The other ~95% was in the possession of Theymos, who continues to refuse to return funds to any customers unless Nefario can supply provably authentic database records showing which customers are owed what balances. This is an impossible task, however, as the only surviving copy of the data resided on a server that was compromised. So now, rather than making a best-effort attempt to return funds to customers as recorded in the database, Theymos is simply thumbing his nose under the auspices of not acting on potentially distorted data.

One point of clarification: you also need access to the Internet in order to create the transaction in the first place, because you need to know what transaction outputs are available for you to spend.

In other words, your Bitcoin balance is made up of discrete "pieces" of varying amounts. It's not like an amount of liquid that you can pour out in any arbitrary quantity. You have to use whole pieces, but you can combine them and re-split them however you like; it all just has to be recorded in the block chain.

One reason to run a full node is to be certain that you never accept as payment a transaction that hasn't followed the rules as you have agreed to them. Running your own node using software that you compiled yourself from code that you have reviewed is the only 100% foolproof means to be certain that you won't accidentally accept a transaction that "cheats" on the rules that you want Bitcoin to follow. Also, your node will only forward transactions that follow the rules your node implements, so in a very small way it can hinder the propagation of transactions that violate the rules to which you've agreed.

The difficulty will never rise that high. You were correct when you said "people will simply stop mining." When a miner can no longer pay his expenses from his revenues, he will close up shop. When a miner leaves the network, the overall hash rate falls, and the difficulty will follow if more hashing power is leaving than joining the network.


Yes. It's a feedback loop. If the difficulty somehow were to rise so much that no miner could profit from transactions, then miners would stop mining, and the difficulty would fall until an equilibrium is reached. In the steady state, mining would be just about as profitable as any other commoditized service in the economy. (If it's more profitable than that, then more miners will join and reduce its profitability. If it's less profitable than that, then miners will leave and increase the profitability for the remaining miners.)

There is no such thing as a "version 1 address." See this [list of common address versions and prefixes]( Most Bitcoin addresses in common use are version 0, and they do not encode any script at all. Version 0 addresses encode (in Base58Check) the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of the public key, which is an EC point. The public key can be encoded in compressed point format or uncompressed point format prior to hashing.


As stated above, the public key is hashed using SHA-256 and then RIPEMD-160, and that final digest is encoded in Base58Check to form a version-0 address (a.k.a. a "pay-to-pubkey-hash" address).
The other kind of commonly used address (though orders of magnitude less commonly used than version 0) is the version-5 address (a.k.a. a "pay-to-script-hash" address). That type of address consists of the Base58Check encoding of the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of a script fragment to be prepended to the scriptSig in a transaction input.


Script is a stack-based virtual machine language. I would not call it a cryptosystem. Some of its opcodes do perform cryptographic operations. Other opcodes perform integer calculations or control the flow of execution.
Newer Intel CPUs contain AES-NI instructions, but no one would call the x64 instruction set "a cryptosystem that happens to embed AES."


You have it backwards. A scriptPubKey is a script that may, but is not required to, include a public key. In the early days of Bitcoin, scriptPubKey did typically contain a public key. Those outputs were of the "pay-to-pubkey" type. The common output type in use today is of the "pay-to-pubkey-**hash**" type. The scriptPubKey of this type of output does not contain a public key but does contain the hash of a public key. "scriptPubKey" is really a misnomer, and I prefer to call it simply an "output script." Likewise, "scriptSig" is a misnomer, and I prefer to call it simply an "input script."


If you give me a point on the secp256k1 curve, I can give you a scriptPubKey that will be noticed by any Bitcoin software which has the corresponding private key in its wallet.

You're probably hashing the image that the camera captures to turn it into a private key, so you're trusting that the hash function generates 256 output bits that are completely independent from each other. I wouldn't make that bet. It's better to pick each bit randomly. Tossing a fair coin 256 times would produce a stronger private key than computing the SHA-256 hash of a random picture.

You're correct in that we will need much greater transaction volume to finance the continuing operation of the network as the initial subsidy phases out.

I pulled that number out of my ass. Just judging by the rapid acceleration of technological development and the trend toward nano-scale manufacturing (several years ago, IBM printed their logo by depositing single atoms on a substrate), I would not be surprised to see molecular assembly and perhaps even atomic assembly within a century. I have no idea if it will be *economical* to "build" gold atoms within that time frame. As rightly stated, it's already possible to transmute atoms of other elements into gold; it's just prohibitively expensive, as it requires a particle accelerator or a nuclear reactor.

I know the term "orphan block" gets used to describe blocks that have been excluded from the main chain, but the term seems wrong to me. An orphan in a directed graph is a node that has no parents, yet all blocks, even blocks created in temporary forks, have exactly one parent, except for the genesis block, which has none. So really the genesis block is the only orphan block in all of Bitcoin. The blocks that are selected against and left behind have no *descendants* and thus should be called "barren blocks" or (as I prefer) "abandoned blocks."

That explanation is close but not entirely compelling. [IEEE double-precision floating-point format]( has 53 bits of significand precision, meaning it can address up to 2^53 − 1 satoshis without any rounding error. Well, that's 9,007,199,254,740,991 satoshis, which is not anywhere close to 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis (or even 2,099,999,997,690,000 satoshis, which is the actual asymptotic limit).
I think a much more compelling explanation is that a signed 32-bit integer can store values up to 2^31 − 1, which is 2,147,483,647. If you assume a fixed-point format with two decimal digits of fractional precision (which is typical for money), then a signed 32-bit integer can address up to 21,474,836.47 bitcoins, which we might as well round off to 21 million. My guess is that Satoshi derived the 21-million limit from here early in development and then later realized that this wouldn't be enough currency units and so extended the number of decimal places from 2 to 8 and changed the variables from 32-bit to 64-bit.

Excellent analysis, and the only of its kind that I've seen. Following from this logic, we are seeing the Bitcoin price decline only because so many early adopters have found themselves with a far greater fraction of their net worth in bitcoins than they care to have. (I'm certainly in that boat.)
I do think we're in a bit of a vicious cycle, though, as the falling price gradually weakens confidence in Bitcoin and causes the "comfortable fraction" to fall, thus causing more coins to be "dishoarded," and further accelerating the price decline.

If this precedent gets set, then there will be good reason to ignore the IRS's guidelines (which are only that, not law) and treat bitcoins as a foreign currency for tax reporting purposes. This has both pros and cons. On the upside, it means that there is no longer a reporting requirement for small transactions. On the downside, it means that large gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, regardless of how long the bitcoins were held (i.e., no break for hodling more than a year).

This is the right answer. This is why altcoins with faster block times are actually doing you a disservice. Litecoin has a 2½-minute block time, but all this means is that each block gives you one quarter the confidence of Bitcoin's  ten-minute blocks, so you need four times as many to reach the same degree of confidence in the transaction. And that's assuming that Litecoin has the same network hashing power as Bitcoin, which it does not. Not even close.

Price movements have no causal relation to the relative numbers of buy orders and sell orders on the book. There could be a million buy orders and one sell order on the book, and the price could plummet; or there could be one buy order and a million sell orders on the book, and the price could shoot to the moon. There is also no causal relationship between the total volume of open interest on the two sides of the book and the movement of the price. The only factor that influences the price is which side is willing to accept the other side's offer, or, in other words, which side is more desperate for its order to go through *right now*.

You can pay the bitcoins to a 2-of-2 multisignature address, where one of the keys is yours and the other belongs to the person you're paying. Then you construct and sign a second transaction to pay the bitcoins from that output to the recipient's key only, and you set a lock time on this second transaction. Now neither party can move the coins again until the time-locked second transaction becomes valid, and then they can only be moved into the recipient's address.

I'm completely confused by your explanation. Here is how I would answer question:
One confirmation gives only a moderate amount of assurance that the transaction in question will forever be included in the main block chain. (The "main" chain is whichever chain of blocks has the greatest sum of target difficulties.) Since it is possible for a block chain to branch, it is prudent to wait until a sufficient number of blocks have been chained onto the block that contains the transaction in question, such that the likelihood of another branch (one that does not contain the transaction in question) becoming the main chain is sufficiently negligible.
In reality, six confirmations is overkill. There hasn't been a chain reorganization of more than a couple of blocks in a very long time (relative to Bitcoin's lifetime).

Convenience stores aren't only paying *fees* on credit cards; they're also losing money to credit-card chargebacks. If someone nabs a credit card, they're going to charge it at the first place they can, to hopefully use it before it's reported as stolen, so a convenience store is a likely target. When the card gets reported, any fraudulent charges made to it are reversed. This means the convenience store never gets the money. This scenario is impossible with Bitcoin. This fact alone should make Bitcoin extremely attractive to convenience stores.

There is also a privacy risk, both for the merchant and for the customers. By reusing a single address, the merchant is disclosing publicly information about their sales volumes. This can harm the merchant by aiding competitors in allocating their resources more efficiently. It's also a risk for customers because a mugger can sit outside in the shadows, watching the merchant's address, and whenever a payment is made to it, the mugger can see the balance at the customer's address and thereby know which customer would be most profitable to mug.

You don't need to reverse the hash function. You only need to know which hash function was used and how many bits of entropy were fed into it. If I tell you I used SHA-256 to produce a 256-bit private key from a 32-bit seed, then you don't need to reverse SHA-256 to find the key space; the key space is simply all the 256-bit keys that can result from applying SHA-256 to a 32-bit number. So you only need to apply SHA-256 to each distinct 32-bit number to find my key, which you can do relatively quickly.

Wrong. A hash is not an encoding.


Misleading. While it's true that more information is required in order to use an EC point as a public key for ECDSA, the additional information (i.e., the curve parameters) is fixed in Bitcoin and so is implied by context.


The exponent is not fixed in most applications of RSA. In contrast, the EC curve parameters are fixed in Bitcoin and so do not need to be communicated.
And by the way, the "key ID" in PGP is merely the last word of the "fingerprint" of the public key, which in turn is merely the hash of a DER encoding of the key.

Why would "pull" persist when we now have smartcards that can sign transactions? I would expect a merchant to present a transaction to the customer's smartcard via NFC, perhaps via the new Bitcoin payment protocol, and the smartcard to sign the transaction and transmit it back to the merchant's terminal, whereupon the merchant would transmit the signed transaction to the network. This is a "pull" transaction because the customer never provides sufficient information to the merchant to enable the merchant to take funds from the customer.

Far more likely than a double spend is a spend of an unconfirmed payment that will never confirm.

This is not a solution. If Alice wants to stiff Bob, then she only needs to broadcast a double-spend that sends her input back to herself but pays a higher fee than Bob is willing to add to the original transaction. Bob will not add more as a fee than he would be paid out from the transaction, as to do so would be net negative for him. Alice will be willing to pay up to the sale amount in fees in order to have the remainder returned to her. If she can get any discount at all, then the strategy is a success for her. The best Bob can do is to add the full sale amount as a fee to force the original transaction to go through, in which case he gets nothing but Alice gets the merchandise. Alice ends in exactly the same state as if she had paid honestly, and Bob is screwed. The best Alice can do is beat Bob to the punch and pay just a little more in fees than Bob manages to add to the transaction before the block is mined, in which case Alice gets the merchandise at a substantial discount, and Bob is still screwed. So see? Bob is screwed in any case. Not a solution.


There are too many typos in this and not enough explanation of the rationale for the various payments. I can't follow the logic. It seems pretty complicated, and my gut tells me a selfish/rational miner would simply throw the whole thing out and mine on his own block every time.

From the linked article:


The key words are "as it is currently." The currently imposed limit does indeed restrict the Bitcoin network to about 7 transactions per second, but this is an artificial limit that will be raised as Bitcoin usage grows.
However, even with the maximum block size increased 500 fold, it's still unlikely that microtransactions would be handled on-chain. Sending the bitcoin equivalent of 10¢ just isn't ever going to be worth the ~250 bytes of storage in the block chain that an average transaction requires.


This is a preposterous statement. It's as though the author believes that Bitcoin's 10-minute block interval was a mistake or an oversight somehow and that copycoins have rectified the mistake by choosing block intervals of 2.5 minutes or even 1 minute. Bitcoin's 10-minute block interval was chosen deliberately; it is not a failure in design.

Indeed, but this is for a reason that doesn't apply to Bitcoin. Silver has been used alongside gold because gold's value density is *too high* for common trade. You can't buy lunch with gold because there's no way to accurately subdivide a gold coin down to a small enough quantity to pay for such a low-value transaction. Silver stands in as a substitute that can more easily be traded in low-value quantities. Bitcoin does not have this problem, as it can be subdivided to negligibly tiny quantities with perfect precision and ease.

The Satoshi client (a.k.a. "Bitcoin core") reserves a small amount of space in each block for fee-free transactions. When building a block, it fills that space with fee-free transactions in order of priority. Then it fills the rest of the block with fee-paying transactions, hopefully in order of fee density (fee paid, divided by size in bytes). Once it's done all that, if it has any space left in the block, it will continue filling it with fee-free transactions, again in order of priority.
The priority is determined by a few factors, but chief among them is "coin age." For each input to the transaction, the number of bitcoins in the input is multiplied by the number of blocks that have passed since the corresponding previous output was placed into the block chain. Then these products are added together to produce an overall "coin age," which has units of "bitcoins•blocks." The higher the coin age, the higher the priority. (There are a few other stipulations too, such as that fee-free transactions cannot have any outputs under a certain amount and that their overall size must be under 1 KB.)

Firstly, I echo what others here have said: **STOP USING THE PHONE!** Next step: flash a custom recovery onto the phone, which you should be able to do either through Fastboot or with a tool like Odin or Heimdall, depending on the manufacturer. Once you've booted the phone into the custom recovery, then you can dump the entire userdata partition out to your computer through adb. At that point, you can run a private key recovery utility on the disk image. If you're lucky, you haven't already done anything with the phone that would have overwritten the sectors where your private key was stored before.
Life lesson: Don't ignore your wallet app's pleadings for you to make a backup of your wallet.

If I were to rent a condo like the one I live in (one of the neighboring units, in fact), the rent would be $1250/mo (according to Zillow). I pay $675/mo in mortgage, $280/mo in condo fees, and $335/mo in property tax, which comes out to $1290/mo. But whereas rent would be 100% flushed down the toilet, $430 of my $1290/mo goes to paying the principal on my mortgage. That's money that I'm paying to myself. When I sell my condo, I'll get most or all of that back (or maybe even more, if the property appreciates). Renting is a fiscally bad choice here. (Edit: typo.)

The UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which is basically like the U.S.'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), says bitcoins are not financial instruments, and thus it has no authority to regulate them. Her Majesty's Revenues and Customs, which is the UK equivalent of the U.S.'s Internal Revenue Service, says bitcoins are multi-purpose vouchers and, as such, are not subject to the Value-Added Tax. (Commissions on bitcoin sales, however, are subject to VAT.) For the moment, it seems no agency within the UK is imposing KYC requirements on bitcoin companies. However, the London-based Bitcoin exchange Coinfloor has taken it upon themselves to comply with all the same KYC/AML requirements as apply to money services businesses in the UK. At the moment, the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin in the UK is still unclear.

The point is that there are more valid compressed keys that correspond to a given RIPEMD160 digest than there are valid uncompressed keys that do. In fact, it's possible that there is only one uncompressed key that corresponds. This is because about half of the bits in an uncompressed public key are determined by the other bits. But it doesn't matter; as pointed out, an attacker can use any suitable compressed key even if your original key was uncompressed.

Thanks for the citation. You're confusing the strength of the cipher (i.e., how much work is required to break it) with the degrees of freedom in the key space. Your argument is that it's perfectly acceptable to draw a private key at random from a key space whose size is the square root of the order of the curve. Doing this significantly weakens the security of the key by square rooting the amount of work that an adversary would need to perform in order to guess it. It may mean the difference between a near-generation quantum computer being able to crack the private key or not.
To convince yourself of why your argument is in error, consider a reduced scenario: an elliptic curve with 64-bit parameters. Would you argue that there's not much advantage in using anything more than 32 bits of entropy to derive a private key for use with that curve? A private key derived from 64 bits of entropy would likely take much longer to guess.

You are correct on all points. I don't believe Apple is interested in creating a new currency. They're doing quite well for themselves in the dollar system.

Until just a few years ago, stock brokerages only kept track of your cost bases as a service to you; they were not required to do so by the IRS, and the 1099-B that they sent to the IRS did not show the cost bases of your sales, only the net proceeds. Some/most brokerages would send you a separate report showing your cost bases, so you could correctly report your capital gains and losses on your tax returns. That changed a few years back, and now the 1099-B's do show the cost bases.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, so we aren't even at the point where the "brokerages" are providing you the service of tracking your cost basis. Even as the Bitcoin ecosystem matures, it won't work quite the same way as stock brokerages: most people don't leave their bitcoins on the exchange where they bought them until they sell them, and once you withdraw your bitcoins, the exchange can no longer track your cost basis. This doesn't absolve you of the legal responsibility for tracking it yourself.

To expound upon what said, splitting a secret in the way you've described weakens the security drastically.

I mean "not safe" in the sense that you can't be certain that your transaction will ever confirm (regardless of how much of a fee you pay). Bitcoin transactions spend the outputs of previous transactions, which they reference by transaction hash. Since a transaction may be mutated (thus changing its hash) at any time before it is included into a block, it's not safe to create new transactions that spend the outputs of unconfirmed transactions. That is why most wallets will not let you spend unconfirmed funds.
As a receiver of bitcoins, generally you can accept zero-confirmations transactions without too much worry, but you must be a LOT more wary about accepting a zero-conf transaction that spends one or more previous outputs that have not been confirmed. That's how you get into trouble.

That's not how modern banking works. Banks don't lend out the money that's been put on deposit; they lend out brand new money, conjured up out of thin air. They're allowed to do this because it's a zero net change on their books: the promissory note that you sign when you take out a loan is worth $X, which they add to the assets side of their books, and then they increase the liabilities side of their books by the same amount when they credit the loan amount to your account. What actually creates the money is your signature on the paper. Most people believe the elementary school explanation of how banking works, but that picture is inaccurate.

If paying a manufacturer in China using Bitcoin is cheaper, faster, and more reliable than an international wire transfer (which it is), then businesses will have an incentive to pay manufacturers using Bitcoin. They could buy those bitcoins, but if they already have bitcoin-paying customers, it'd be cheaper for them to keep enough of that bitcoin revenue as bitcoins that they could pay the manufacturers without needing to buy any bitcoins, thereby saving the exchange fees twice.
TL;DR: There are bigger profits to be had by retaining some bitcoin revenue as bitcoins.

If only you knew who you're talking to, you'd understand how funny that question is.
Since you presumably know about order books, you must realize that it's possible to place a bid that will cause you to *BUY* when the market moves *DOWN* or to place an ask that will cause you to *SELL* when the market moves *UP*. So you cannot say that buying moves the price up and that selling moves the price down. Every trade that occurs involves one person buying and one person selling. Which direction the price moves as a result of the trade is entirely dependent on which side of the trade was the maker and which side was the taker.

Agree. You can engrave your private key onto a piece of sheet metal or a copper ingot or something like that. Try to pick a metal with a high melting point. Aluminum would not be so good. If you want to be an absolute baller, engraving onto a platinum ingot would be great, as platinum has a very high melting point and is also quite hard. ~~Carbon won't melt at all at atmospheric pressures, and no fire short of an atomic fireball is hot enough to vaporize it, so an engraved graphite bar might be the best physical backup medium for a private key.~~ **EDIT:** Carbon burns in oxygen at temperatures within the realm of a house fire.

I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any cryptographer who would consider a hash function to be an asymmetric cipher, yet that seems to be what you're asserting.
The only public keys currently in use in Bitcoin are EC public keys on the secp256k1 curve. The only private keys currently in use in Bitcoin are 256-bit integers. And the only digital signature algorithm currently in use in Bitcoin is ECDSA. Input scripts and output scripts are not themselves signatures and public keys. They can contain signatures and public keys, but that is not a requirement.

There is exactly **one** good thing about inflation: it causes government budget lines to be automatically cut (effectively) unless they can muster the votes to pass a nominal increase. I've served on my town's finance committee for six years, and I can tell you that a "flat" budget (which is what happens by default if the voters don't approve an increase) is effectively a cut due to inflation. Without inflation the only way to reduce a budget would be to actively propose and pass a nominal decrease, and that's a lot harder than doing nothing.
That said, inflation is a cancer on the whole.

As you say, Bitcoin is a world currency. As a seller in a bitcoin-regulated country, you won't be able to accept bitcoins from unregistered addresses.

That's not how exchanges work. Fiat doesn't just disappear; it only moves from one account to another.

Alternatively, if YYY only reads from its standard input, then you can redirect its standard input from the file:

@_date: 2014-10-13 05:03:23
One compelling theory is that the rise in price to ~$1200 was almost entirely due to fraudulent bot activity on MtGox. We know that the first crash of MtGox (from ~$30 to ~$2) was due to hackers who broke into MtGox's database and credited their own accounts with non-existent bitcoins and then sold those bitcoins on the exchange, which crashed the price. This is public knowledge. What was not shared publicly, according to the theory, is that these hackers also *withdrew real bitcoins* from MtGox after giving themselves large bitcoin balances in the database. MtGox's bitcoin withdrawals system was completely automated, and these hackers were able to empty the hot wallet completely before the full gravity of the hack was appreciated. Faced with the impending risk of losing his dear exchange entirely, Mark Karpeles swept this theft under the rug and began operating MtGox in a fractional-reserve mode, vowing to replace the stolen bitcoins over time using operating profits. However, the market price of bitcoins started to rise quickly, and the bitcoins that Mark needed to replace started becoming quite expensive. Other exchanges were starting up, too, and Mark knew he would not be able to replace all the stolen bitcoins if the price kept rising and MtGox kept losing market share. He tried a few times to stage technical failures of MtGox's trading engine to crash the price so that he could continue buying coins cheaply (perhaps on other exchanges), but aside from only temporarily suppressing the price, this also had the effect of causing large numbers of MtGox customers to withdraw their bitcoins. Now MtGox was running short on bitcoins, and Mark started delaying bitcoin withdrawals because MtGox simply had no bitcoins to send out. In desperation to save his business, Mark did the unthinkable: he started buying bitcoins using his customers' fiat deposits. He built a bot to do this at regular intervals. Evidence of this bot's actions is presented in the infamous "Willy Report." The bot succeeded in bringing more bitcoins into MtGox but only because its persistent buying was driving the price up to unimaginable and preposterous levels. This was putting a serious squeeze on Mark. Bitcoins were becoming extremely expensive, and there just wasn't enough fiat on deposit to continue buying bitcoins while still keeping enough dollars in reserve to meet withdrawal demands. Then the catastrophe happened: U.S. feds froze MtGox's U.S. bank account. Now MtGox really didn't have enough dollars on hand to meet withdrawal demand, and the "banking issues" started. Fiat withdrawals were "delayed" because there wasn't enough money in the bank to pay them out, although Karpeles would not publicly admit this. These "delays" caused the price of bitcoins on MtGox to soar even higher, as the only way for customers to remove their money was to trade it for bitcoins and withdraw the bitcoins. This condition was able to limp along for a while, as the rapidly rising price caused more and more bitcoins to flow into MtGox from greedy and/or naïve bitcoiners who believed that they would eventually be able to withdraw their fiat. Then Mark had a brilliant idea: he could exploit the FUD surrounding the recently popularized "transaction malleability issue" to explain away the missing bitcoins as a technical failing of Bitcoin itself rather than as a security failing of his own. But in order for this to work, he would need to make MtGox whole on the fiat side, so he threw his bitcoin-buying bot into reverse, causing a massive and prolonged crash of the market. The bot sold huge amounts of bitcoins to bring the fiat side of MtGox's books back nearly to full reserve. Then MK finally revealed the shortage of bitcoins and placed the blame on transaction malleability, hoping that he would not be held criminally negligent and that his illicit use of his customers' deposits would never come to light.

If there were a sudden loss of hashing power in the Bitcoin network, there would be a period of time during which blocks would be found at unusually long intervals. This is because the difficulty only adjusts every 2160 blocks. If the difficulty had just adjusted immediately prior to the solar flare or whatever, then it could be quite a while before it could adjust again to make mining easier, especially since the next 2160 blocks would take much longer than the usual two weeks due to the reduced hash rate.
@_date: 2014-11-19 10:44:58
A pool can't force a change in the protocol, even if it does have a majority of the hashing power. If it tried, it would go from having 51% of the hashing power of Bitcoin to having 100% of the hashing power of an alt-coin that no one uses. The rest of the miners and the entire user base would still be using the original rules and would be ignoring the rogue miner's blocks.

mBTC is the silver to BTC's gold.
You should realize that the reason we use(d) both silver and gold as money is because gold has too high a value density to be used for small transactions. You can't buy your lunch with gold because it's not practical to measure out a small enough amount of gold accurately enough to pay such a small sum.

It's not all that dangerous for the business, barring attack by quantum computers, but it is dangerous for the customer. If the merchant is reusing a single address (or a small number of addresses) to receive payments from customers, then a prospective mugger can simply watch the merchant's address(es) for transactions, and when a transaction occurs, the mugger can then see the balance in the customer's wallet. This instructs the mugger on which customers would be worthwhile to target. If, however, the merchant were using unique addresses for every transaction, then the mugger would not be able to monitor the merchant's transactions and thus would have no way of knowing which Bitcoin-using customers are carrying high balances.

The transaction that sends all the bitcoins to a new address is generated unsigned on a computer that has access to the block chain and is then carried by hand into multiple bank vaults, each of which contains a netbook that never connects to the Internet. Each of those netbooks adds a signature to the transaction. Finally, the fully signed transaction is carried back to a computer that has an Internet connection and is broadcast to the Bitcoin network. In this way, the private keys never touch a computer that is "hot" (connected to the Internet), so it is in fact multi-signature cold storage.

This is why you should never reuse Bitcoin addresses. If you follow that simple rule, then even an ideal quantum computer would need to perform 2^80 operations to brute-force a public key that could correspond to your Bitcoin address, and then it would need to solve for the private key to spend your bitcoins. 2^80 is still an intractable number of operations.

The best times to buy have been in prolonged periods of stability. Every time Bitcoin has been relatively stable for a while, it has experienced a dramatic and rapid rise in price afterward. Buying in during periods of high volatility isn't such a great strategy, though eventually the rising tide will raise all boats.

You know what's old and tired? The "you can always leave" argument. If I were your neighbor and I were to come into your house and start trashing the place and stealing stuff from you, you wouldn't like it, would you? Well, *you could always leave*. But the fact that you chose to live next door to me, and the fact that you've stayed there all this time, even though you know I'm a kleptomaniac, means you consent to what I'm doing. See how that argument doesn't work?
Now suppose someone comes along and does a useful service for you. Let's say they paint your house. And let's even suppose that they do a really great job at it. Now they give you a bill for $10,000. You say, "WTF! I didn't ask you to paint my house. You can't charge me for this!" They say they painted every house on your street, and you don't get to opt out, and if you don't pay, they will send armed thugs to haul you off and lock you in a cage, and if you resist the thugs, they will kill you.

The switch to LevelDB in Bitcoin Core 0.7.0 exposed an implementation limit in BerkeleyDB, which older versions were using. This caused new nodes to accept blocks that older nodes were rejecting due to database transaction failures. This caused a hard fork in the block chain. The response of the Bitcoin community was to downgrade miners to 0.6.* until a patch could be prepared for 0.7.1 to artificially reject blocks with a large number of transaction inputs, until the old nodes with the deficient database implementation could be phased out.

Rather than choosing one address completely at random, which is likely to choose an address of a non-miner, it might be better to choose the address to which a coinbase transaction has previously been paid. Then you're sure to choose a miner; you just might choose one that's no longer active.
Regardless, your proposal is fatally flawed. The probability that a given miner will be chosen *AND* will solve a block first (even at a reduced difficulty) is orders of magnitude smaller than the probability that a given miner will solve a block first (at the normal difficulty). In other words, it probably would never happen.

Technically the *last* bit will always be a zero. That's because block hashes are compared with the hash target as though they were 256-bit integers in little-endian byte order (meaning the most significant bits are last). When block hashes are printed in hex for humans to see, they are printed in big-endian order, so the last hex digit you see in the hash actually represents the first four bits of the hash.

Lamassu makes money in two ways: (1) by selling machines for more than they cost to manufacture (though they make almost no profit on the machines at the $4000 bulk-discounted price point), and (2) through the existence of their machines in the market, which enhances the value proposition of Bitcoin itself, which increases the value of the founders' personal savings.
The operator makes money by charging a commission on bitcoin sales through the machine. The commission rate can be set by the operator and typically ranges between 1% and 5%, depending on the amount of competition in the target market.
By taking a 3% commission, an operator would need bitcoin sales totaling $133,333 USD to break even on the machine. Given that customers often purchase more than $1000 worth of bitcoins in a single transaction with the machine, this sales target is actually easier to reach than you might expect. Advertising your machine on a site like [CoinMap]( could easily bring in that much in sales in just a few months.

1. If you don't have a static IP address on your home Internet connection, then set up a dynamic DNS mapping to your home computer.
1. Forward the Bitcoin P2P port (TCP 8333) through your router if you don't have UPnP working.
1. In the Schildbach wallet app on your mobile device, go into the Settings, check "Skip regular peer discovery," and enter your home IP address or dynamic DNS name as the "Trusted peer."
1. Now your mobile wallet will only connect to your home computer's Bitcoin node, which presumably you trust implicitly.

Right. The steady state is where all active miners are just breaking even. Think about it:
* If any miners are profiting, then more miners will come online to compete with them for the profits. This raises the difficulty and thus the cost of mining, thereby eliminating the profit. End result: all active miners are just breaking even.
* If any miners are losing money, then they will quit mining. End result: all active miners are just breaking even.
This has always been the case and always will be, and it's why I've never been even slightly interested in mining bitcoins.

Transactions vary in size. 250 bytes seems to be a good rule of thumb. So that means you could get about 4200 transactions in a 1-MiB block. But keep in mind that the required fee increases exponentially as a block approaches maximum capacity, so it's very unlikely that a block would ever completely fill up.


Not necessary at all. It would work exactly the same way credit cards work now, only using XBT as the currency rather than USD. You make charges to your credit card in XBT. You get a bill that says "pay this amount to this Bitcoin address." You send the bitcoins (via the block chain), and your bill is settled.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:05:12

To clarify, this divergence will begin after an initial steep loss in value due to losing so many users, but on the plus side, every owner of the old Bitcoin will automatically become an owner of the new Bitcoin (in addition to still owning the old Bitcoin), as that's what happens when the block chain forks. You could wait for the new coin to become established and then sell your newcoins for oldcoins.

You're right. If I have 100 XBT in a single UTxO in my Bitcoin wallet, then even if I'm perfectly following the best practices and never reusing addresses, whomever I pay can still see that I paid them 4 millibits from a 100-XBT "bar" that I had. (Like hauling out a gigantic gold bar to shave off a sliver for the merchant.)
Long-term, we are really going to need wallets that do better coin management. Another present issue that needs solving arises if you try to make multiple payments within a short span of time. If you have too few discrete UTxOs in your wallet, then you will end up spending your unconfirmed change, and it is exceptionally risky for merchants to accept zero-confirmation transactions involving unconfirmed inputs, far riskier than the ordinary risk they run by accepting zero-confirmation transactions at all.

I've only paid with bitcoins at retail a few times, but every time it has taken longer than a credit card authorization. A couple of times it has taken longer than a minute.

Decentralization and fast confirmation time are opposing goals. Retail point-of-sale transactions will likely go with centralized solutions in the long run. Green addresses are a likely solution.

The easier-to-use bitcoin machines (like Lamassu's) simply have you scan a QR code of your Bitcoin address (either from your smartphone, tablet, or computer, or else from paper) and then insert banknotes of your local currency. Before you begin, they'll display their selling price on the screen, which should already include whatever commissions they'll be taking. You should compare the advertised price versus alternatives available to you (such as LocalBitcoins or an online Bitcoin exchange) to determine whether the asking price is worth the convenience to you. After you've put in all the banknotes you care to spend, you press a button, and the bitcoins are transmitted to the address that you scanned.
The more complex machines (such as Robocoin's) require you to open an account with their centralized service, which you can do right at the machine. Typically you have to scan identity documents (and sometimes biometrics such as your palm print) and wait for approval before you can use the machine. Once you're approved, you can buy or sell bitcoins at these machines. When you buy bitcoins, they are either sent to your existing address (as with the Lamassu machine), or they are loaded into a new address, the private key for which is dispensed on a printed piece of paper like a receipt. When you sell bitcoins, typically you must send the bitcoins to an address displayed by the machine in a QR code on its screen and then return later, after the transaction has been confirmed by the network, to collect your banknotes.

Nah. You can create a Bitcoin private key with just 256 randomly chosen bits. The "algorithm" (if you could call it that) simply forms a 256-bit integer from those bits and computes the remainder modulo *n*, where *n* is the order of the generator point on the [secp256k1]( elliptic curve.
Actually, to be perfectly secure, one should discard any randomly selected 256-bit integer that exceeds *n* and start over. Using the remainder introduces a bias.

I used "untainted" subjectively in that case. By it, I meant, any version of Bitcoin that does not implement the controversial change under consideration. Thus far, there have been no changes implemented in the mainline Bitcoin client that I have found contrary to the founding principles of Bitcoin, and so I continue to run the latest version. If ever the developers would insert some new "feature" that I believe to be violating the essence of Bitcoin, I would probably fork the project and continue to merge non-violating changes from the mainline while excluding the violating change. Of course, if I were the only person using my new altcoin, it would be worthless. However, I suspect there are quite a few people who would agree with me, as my objection would only be to some change in the economic fundamentals, such as the subsidy schedule or absence of demurrage.

Both of these bugs relate to editing a recurring buy/sell.
1. If the amount is given in USD and is over $1000, then the amount that is prepopulated into the form field is formatted with a comma. Upon submission, the field is parsed incorrectly, and only the part of the number before the comma is used. Thus, a $2345.67 buy becomes a $2 buy.
2. There seems to be an issue with time zones being applied inconsistently. When editing a recurring buy/sell, the form is initialized with a time that is different than the original scheduled time. Upon submitting the form, the time of the recurring buy/sell gets changed, even if the time field was never intentionally changed.
Together, these bugs mean that the amount always needs its comma removed, and the time always needs to be fixed any time a recurring buy/sell is edited.

The masses are not going to be running Bitcoin clients. They are going to be using a wallet smart card. All the block chain handling and network interaction will be on the merchant side.

The better cards will have an e-ink or chLCD display and a capacitive touch button to allow "two-tap" payment: first tap (without holding the button) allows the card to display the amount to be paid; second tap (while holding the button) allows the card to sign a transaction only for the amount previously displayed.

So do you envision a new generation of Bitcoin wallet apps that support automatically paying signed Bitcoin payment requests on a set schedule? Since Bitcoin is a "push" payment system (unlike credit/debit cards, which are a "pull" payment system), it's a little difficult to imagine how customers could get roped into automated, periodic payments. PayPal's subscription feature can pull funds from your bank account or credit card if you don't have a sufficient PayPal balance, but would a Bitcoin wallet be able to do this? I guess a service like Coinbase or Circle could do the same thing as PayPal, in theory.

No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that the hash rate (and thus the difficulty) is ultimately limited by miners' ability to afford more hardware. Already miners are spending upwards of 90% of their revenues just on electricity, leaving only 10% for expansion. If their revenues fall much more, they may start charging higher fees to include transactions into blocks. However, like any price in a free market, they cannot set their prices arbitrarily high. Hardly anyone would pay 0.01 XBT as a transaction fee. A miner asking fees that high would get almost no takers. Fees will be only as high as the market will bear and no higher. We will only see $8 fees when $8 can no longer buy a stick of gum.

A bit is also 1/8th of a byte, which is precisely why we shouldn't use it for denoting quantities of digital money.

Yes, you're correct: it's still as strong as the reduced key strength.

There are two ways to solve for the private key: by solving for it in the signature or by solving for it from the public key. Both require computing a discrete logarithm over an elliptic-curve group, which is an operation for which we currently have no efficient algorithm capable of running on a classical computer. If you know that the private key was derived from a seed with less entropy than the size of the key itself, then your search space is reduced. This could mean that a future partial compromise of ECDSA could render your low-entropy keys vulnerable to attack when high-entropy keys would still be safe. It could also mean that a future quantum computer would not need as many q-bits to solve for your low-entropy key as would be needed to solve for a high-entropy key.
In general, if you have the option of using 256 bits of entropy to produce a 256-bit key and there is no appreciable advantage to using less entropy, then you should use 256 bits of entropy. The reason some Bitcoin standards proposals use 128-bit seeds is to reduce the number of words that must be written down and subsequently re-entered by a human user. It's a trade-off of security for convenience. If there is no additional work/inconvenience for a human to use 256 bits of entropy, then that should be preferred.

Not every fiat currency uses paper. There are hundreds of altbills, some of which switched their mining algorithm from paper to polymer. It's not a big enough technological advantage for them to overcome the network effect of the U.S. dollar, though. That said, due to a design bug, the USD's block subsidy doesn't converge to zero, so USD remains inflationary in the long run and will eventually become worthless as the supply increases toward infinity.

Each miner (solo miner or mining pool operator) constructs their own block to solve. It isn't handed to them by the network. The network only hands them transactions, which they are free to include or omit from the block they construct. It's perfectly valid for a miner to build nothing but empty blocks, but they'd be forfeiting some transaction fees that they could have claimed if they'd included some transactions in their block.

When properly bolted down, getting into this machine would require several minutes and would produce a lot of noise and sparks. You'd have to use an angle grinder, as the exterior shell is 2.5-mm steel. The unit altogether weighs over 100 pounds. It's not something that you can casually pick up and take with you.
That said, it's not intended for unattended installation. (But neither are those freestanding legacy ATMs.) It would be fine in a bar, restaurant, shop, or mall, basically anywhere that there are a lot of people who would notice if someone came and started cutting into it with power tools.
And unlike a legacy ATM, this machine is *emptied* of cash every day, instead of being *filled* with cash every day.

My guess is they were trying to trigger the auto-resend behavior by successfully mutating the withdrawal transaction so MtGox would believe it had failed and try again.

I didn't say anything about a brute-force attack. An adversary with a quantum computer could likely solve for your private key within hours (or even seconds) if given your public key. It would take considerably longer (so long as to be intractable) to find a public key that matches an address, as cryptographic hashes are believed to be secure against quantum computers, the best known attack only reducing the search space by a square root (from 2^160 to 2^(80)). (Bitcoin addresses have 160 bits of entropy, not 128 as you said.)

I think you must be missing something. Maybe there is a UI element somewhere that you're not noticing, I'm not sure. It sounds like you're making the process a lot more difficult for yourself than it needs to be. You should not need to be flipping back and forth. Open up Gyft, tap Buy, and choose your merchant and amount. Choose to pay with bitcoins. On the BitPay invoice that loads up, tap the "Pay with Bitcoin" button. This will launch your bitcoin wallet. (You may be prompted to choose which wallet app you want to use, if you have multiple eligible apps installed.) When your wallet opens, it will be on the payment page, with the address and amount already filled in. Just tap Send. In a few seconds, a box will pop up telling you your gift card is in your Gyft account. Tap the button in that dialog box to go back to Gyft, and then tap your new gift card to reveal the code or whatever. I don't see how it could get much more streamlined than this.

The government is not monolithic. Various agencies have varying incentives and objectives. I think it's quite plausible that Bitcoin was invented by the NSA.

Graph analysis is the NSA's bread and butter, and the block chain gives them a flawless and perfectly consistent graph to analyze. It's an analyst's wet dream. However, the taxation side of the government likely hates Bitcoin. Law enforcement also likely hates Bitcoin because their civil asset forfeiture scam doesn't work on crypto-currencies.

Burning bitcoins shrinks the supply of bitcoins and has no effect on the demand for bitcoins. Lesser supply at the same level of demand implies a higher price.
Note that I discount the value of all altcoins to zero, as that is their inevitable final value (see "network effect"), so when someone burns some bitcoins to hop on some altcoin bandwagon for a little while, this has no long-term effect on the demand for bitcoins. When the altcoin eventually dies, they'll be back to Bitcoin.

If the merchant does it right, you just click a button or a link, and your Bitcoin client pops up with the payment address and amount already filled in. The [Bitcoin URI scheme]( handles this. BitPay and Coinbase are already using these URIs on their payment pages. Browser support on computers is spotty (though the "bitcoin:" URI scheme has been added to the HTML5 standard and has already been whitelisted in Google Chrome), but support on Android phones is excellent: when I tap a Bitcoin payment button in my phone's browser, I am given a choice among the several Bitcoin wallet apps on my phone for which one I want to use to pay. When I choose one, it opens, and the recipient's address and amount to pay are already filled in.

I use eGifter's mobile web site when I want to buy a Domino's Pizza gift card for an exact amount. It's pretty cumbersome, but it *is* possible to do the entire process on my phone, including ordering the pizza, buying the gift card with bitcoins, and paying for the pizza with the gift card. Sadly, Domino's mobile app does not allow paying with gift cards, so I'm forced to use their mobile web site too. All of this is way more difficult than it should be, but I can't complain too much; I'm ecstatic that it's even possible.

So if I accept currency... with the intent... of transmitting currency... to another person... if a certain predetermined condition established by the transmitter (i.e., myself) is met, then I am a money transmitter according to FinCEN.
This means when I accept my paycheck (currency) with the intent of handing (transmitting) cash (currency) to a bartender (another person) if the bartender serves me a beer (a precondition determined by me), then I am a money transmitter.
This should make for some entertaining court cases.

If you're the "maker" in your purchases, then the price is moving downward whenever you buy. You put a bid on the book. It didn't match with any asks. The only way your bid will match will be if some seller comes down to meet it. Thus, you've lowered the price by buying. The seller was more motivated to sell than you were to buy, so the seller pushes the market price down.

The priority calculation isn't intended to get transactions into blocks faster. It's intended to prevent spam from getting into blocks ahead of ham. It's a spam counter-measure, as are transaction fees in the first place. Eventually, it's likely that no free-riding transactions will be accepted into blocks at all. Just pay the damn fee.

I think that analysis has been debunked. In short, the researchers can't possibly have seen every mutated transaction in the Bitcoin network because the default behavior of nodes is not to forward transactions that appear to be double spends. The researchers could observe some transaction mutation attempts by connecting to a high number of diffuse nodes, but if MtGox's outgoing transactions were being mutated very close to the source, it's likely that these researchers never would have observed MtGox's original transactions — they would only have observed the mutated transactions — and so they could not possibly identify those transactions as mutated.

Asset prices (stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate) crashed hard in the Great Recession. I would expect that the bitcoin price will crash hard in the next recession (which will probably be worse, as the broken fundamentals that caused the last one were never fixed, just papered over). It isn't about exiting from fiat, it's about selling off assets to pay off debt (i.e., deleveraging). When the next wave of foreclosures and bankruptcies hits, there will be massive deleveraging, just as there was last time, and the bitcoin price will tank. Of course, so will the price of everything else, and bitcoin may actually suffer the least. We shall see.

If you broadcast a transaction with too little fee, then it may get "stuck" in the memory pool for an unacceptably long time. If you want to speed the transaction along, it must be possible for you to resubmit it with a larger fee, but this is impossible as long as nodes are unconditionally rejecting new transactions that spend the same outputs as pending transactions in their memory pools. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:19:25
The point is that you are actually *hurting* your security by using multiple keys in this case. If you have two private keys to keep safe, then the probability that *both* of them survive is the *square* of the probability that only one key survives (assuming the survival of each key is independent). So if there is a 0.0001% chance that a single private key will be lost (due to mechanical failure, electrostatic discharge, cosmic ray impact, whatever), then there is about a 0.0002% chance that either or both of a pair of private keys will be lost.

That's the Base58Check encoding, and it's 25 *characters*, which may or may not be 25 *bytes* (depending on what character encoding you're using). The raw address is 20 bytes.
To compare apples to apples, you'd also have to claim that a public key is 66 characters (two hex digits per byte). So 66 characters versus 25 characters for the encoded forms (which are not used in the actual protocol), or 33 bytes versus 20 bytes for the raw forms.

The bill validator alone costs well more than $500. Then there is the tablet, peripheral hardware, and all the custom-made cabling and electronics inside the case. The locks (two of them) are Abloy Protec locks, the best in the industry. The enclosure is thick (~3-mm) plate steel, and the internal strong box is armor-grade Hardox alloy. The whole thing weighs over 100 pounds. All of that really adds up in cost. The markup is more like $1000 on a $5000 retail price tag. Volume pricing is basically at cost.

Actually, if you have open sell orders awaiting fulfillment, then they will only be filled if the price goes *up*. It's only if you're placing sell orders *at market* that you'd be pushing the price down, and such orders fill right away and so cannot be cancelled.
Having open sell orders does provide resistance on the way up, though, so maybe you meant to say that the price can rise faster without so much resistance.

To echo what said, Visa is just a protocol and network connecting merchant payment processors with banks.
It's already possible to have a debit card backed by a bank account holding USD and to use the debit card in a transaction spending EUR. You don't have to "preload" the card with euros; the exchange from USD to EUR happens automatically the instant you initiate the transaction. So too should it be possible to have a debit card backed by XBT and to use the debit card in a transaction spending USD. The "bank" holding the XBT gets a callback from the Visa network that so many USD are being charged to the card, and the "bank" sells the XBT for USD on the spot.
It seems like the real problem is that Visa is only allowing network access to banks but not to "banks." Hopefully the recent forays into Bitcoin by giants First Data and Global Payments signal the beginnings of Bitcoin's incursion into the Visa network.

If any mining pool operator tried to abuse a &gt;50% share of the network mining power, the pool would immediately lose a significant proportion of its miners, and it would no longer have &gt;50%.
The danger to Bitcoin is not from mining pools with &gt;50%; it's from *miners* with &gt;50%. A pool is just a transient/ephemeral association of miners. A pool would dissolve if its operator tried anything nefarious. The danger is just if a single actor controls &gt;50% of the hashing power.

Given that a Lamassu machine will not ordinarily reach full capacity in a given day, and given that a legacy ATM will not ordinarily be completely drained in a given day, then the expectation at any given time is that the legacy ATM is holding more cash than the Lamassu machine. I would also posit that legacy ATMs have a much larger cash holding capacity than the Lamassu machine, which has a capacity of 1000 bills.


I would expect most operators of Lamassu machines to be retail businesses that already have a need to transport and deposit their daily cash receipts.

Almost correct. The private key is any number between 1 and *n*-1, where *n* is the number of points in the group generated by the generator point. (*n* is a consequence of the particular elliptic curve and generator point, not something you decide.)
The public key is simply the generator point (which is predetermined for all of Bitcoin), multiplied by your chosen private key. This multiplication produces another point that is somewhere else on the elliptic curve. Crucially, it is computationally infeasible to "work backwards" from this point to determine the private key. This is known as the "elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem," and there is no known algorithm for solving it in polynomial time or better, meaning it's not realistically possible if you use big enough numbers.
The public key is then hashed to produce the Bitcoin address.


The private key in Bitcoin is 256 bits long. ("Bit" is a contraction of "*b*inary dig*it*.") You can determine how many decimal digits this is by a simple change of base: 256 * log(2)/log(10) = ~77. So the private key is about 77 decimal digits long.
The public key is made up of two coordinates that are each 256 bits long, but the *y* coordinate is determined by the *x* coordinate (per the elliptic curve's equation), so really the public key is effectively 256 bits long as well.


The private key should be generated in a "cryptographically secure" manner. Ideally, it should come from a physical random source, such as thermal noise or radioactive decay. Somewhat less ideal but much more practical are the cryptographic pseudorandom number generators commonly found in computer operating systems; these use the timings between highly unpredictable events (such as keystrokes, mouse movements, disk seeks, network packets, etc.) to generate pseudorandom numbers.
The least secure way to generate Bitcoin private keys is to use a common software pseudorandom number generator. These typically incorporate too little entropy to be sufficient for generating cryptographic keys.

That's about equivalent to the janitors at Google arguing over whether Gmail should add support for sending Bitcoin. Theoretically they have a say in the company policy (and "they can always quit" if they disagree with it), but realistically their opinions have no effect.
If you still think voting actually affects anything in this country, I don't have much else to say to you. Elections are a dog and pony show. You have no real choices.


The government here is a local monopoly. If you can admit that there are multiple governments in the world, competing with each other for market share, then what's the problem with having multiple "governments" servicing a particular geographical area? Why must each square inch of land area on the planet have exactly one government ~~ruling over it~~ providing services to it?


Do you honestly believe the government of the United States of America is still accountable to the people? Amazing.


I get *terrible* service from the government. When was the last time you contacted the IRS? Used the Postal Service? Filed a police report? They treat you with the least amount of attention possible.
Actually, the Postal Service has stepped up their game a little bit because they've been losing market share hand over fist to private parcel shipping companies, but the USPS gets massive bailouts from the taxpayers continuously, so it really doesn't need to operate in the black to remain "in business."


The *only* thing that has to change is the commonly held delusion that individuals in a certain group, calling themselves "the government," have certain rights that other individuals do not have. If that were to change — if people were to wake up and realize that all individuals have the same rights, and that shiny badges do not grant extra rights, we would have many more choices for which agencies we want to protect ourselves and our properties and which agencies we want to settle our disputes with others. We can already choose which agencies we want to insure our cars and educate our children (to some extent, though we can't opt out of supporting the state's school, even if we opt to use a different school). Why can some services be provided by the market, but other services must be provided by a government? What makes police protection so "special" that it cannot be provided by multiple agencies competing for your business?


If you're getting bad service from State Farm, do you join a PAC to lobby their executives to implement better corporate policies, or do you take your business elsewhere? Does taking your business elsewhere require you to pick up your life and relocate to a distant land?


Military protection is probably the service presently provided by governments that would be hardest to privatize. The challenge is that it has an "area effect." Many other services presently provided solely by government do not have such an effect and are better candidates to take up first.


Unlikely. Violent conflict is extraordinarily expensive. The only reason governments are even able to engage in it is that they can take money from their subjects by force. By contrast, voluntary subscribers to a military service would exit in droves if their service provider were wasting money on a grand scale like that. It's far more profitable to resolve disputes peaceably.


I don't understand the second half of your question. Why do service providers need to be geographically separated in order to provide quality security services?


Again, it's a matter of what people believe. Whenever the government tries to assert large-scale control over Internet content, there is massive publish backlash. This happens because we the people believe that government should not have control over information. What about when the government tries to assert large-scale control over people's medical care? Well, evidently there aren't enough people who believe that this should not happen to prevent it from happening, so that's what we're now getting. So, to answer your question, we *would* end up devolving back into what we have now *unless* there is a public perception that monopolies are always bad, even when the monopoly involves services like police, fire protection, schools, roads, etc.


"Society" is not a person. Society does not have rights. Individuals have rights.
I will grant you that I presently am able to enjoy exclusive use of my domicile because The State has provided me with certain services. I will not, however, grant you that those services can only be provided by The State, and I will not grant that those services must be forced upon every person under penalty of imprisonment or death.


Control over the commodity of "social order" presently is monopolized within certain geographic areas.


The problem with democracies is that the minority always loses. Ironically, proponents of democracy often speak of protecting the rights of minorities, but the smallest minority is the individual.


If you own a piece of land through which a stream flows, and if, somehow, you were able to consume so much of the water flowing by that you caused damages to landowners further downstream, then those landowners would have a legitimate cause of action against you. There would be a dispute, and it would go to arbitration, and you would either have to reduce your water use or pay a usage fee to the downstream landowners to compensate them for the reduced enjoyment of their property that you're causing.


Of course a group of people can claim exclusive control over a certain piece of property. But imagine that Apple one day claims control over all property in Silicon Valley, and they proclaim that all residents of the valley are now shareholders of Apple Inc. and, as such, will have votes in the corporation. Does the fact that the residents of this valley have a vote at Apple legitimize Apple's ownership claim over the valley?

Well, if you can pay a higher fee than the original transaction, and if the miners are implementing "replace-by-fee" semantics (no guarantee they will, though), then you might be able to override the transaction with another one that sends your coins elsewhere. Bitcoin isn't really designed to have cancelable transactions, though. It's designed to mimic the semantics of a physical commodity, meaning, after you give it to someone, you can't claw it back.

If it's taking 3-5 days for you to get your USD from a sale of bitcoins on Coinbase, then you have only your bank to blame. (They are sitting on your money for 1-3 days and earning interest from it before they finally hand it over to you.)
ACH transfers clear in the early morning of the business day following the business day in which they were submitted to the system. If you use a bank that's not an outright fraud, your money will show up in your account on the same day as it clears the ACH. I use Capital One 360 (formerly ING DIRECT), and I can withdraw from PayPal via ACH and have the money in my checking account, ready to spend or transfer elsewhere, on the very next business day. Coinbase seems to take two days, I guess because they don't submit the transfer until the next business day, and then it takes until the business day after that to clear into the destination account.

You should read up more on how transaction fees work in Bitcoin. They are not intended to be fixed. (That they are presently is an implementation artifact that the developers are working to resolve.) The intent is for fees to float on the open market. No miner would be able to get away with charging $8 for a transaction. Other miners competing with him would include your transaction in a block for a tiny fraction of that.

You're talking about the concept of segregated accounts. I doubt that there is any established precedent for whether bitcoins held on behalf of customers qualify as segregated assets. I think, generally, when you deposit bitcoins at an exchange, your bitcoins become assets of the exchange, and the exchange has a matching liability to you. If the exchange goes under, "your" bitcoins would be pooled with all other assets of the company and used to pay the creditors of the company, including the depositors, but you might not get 100% of your balance back. But I am not a lawyer, and I could be wrong.

Not exactly. It's not any more difficult (or costly) to mine a block containing 10,000 transactions than it is to mine a block containing 10 transactions. (Okay, there are a few more CPU cycles needed to verify the transactions, but that's infinitesimal compared to the cycles that go into hashing.) The ceiling on the number of transactions per second is a function of the maximum block size, which is an adjustable parameter. When blocks start filling up and getting a transaction into a block starts requiring increasingly onerous fees, the miners and the devs will reach a consensus about increasing the max block size parameter.
As for people paying for a beer at the bar, I would honestly expect such transactions eventually to go through payment networks like Visa. The block chain, I expect, will eventually only be used as a back-end settlement mechanism or for large payments between individuals that are not particularly time-sensitive. Direct Bitcoin transactions aren't really that well suited to retail point of sale, due to the confirmation time lag. (And no, altcoins with shorter block intervals do not solve the problem.)

If you have a "nest egg" of bitcoins, you should keep it at an address that has never been spent from before. The danger of keeping a large sum of bitcoins at an address from which bitcoins have previously been spent is that the public key for that address is then known publicly. This considerably reduces the work that an adversary with a quantum computer would need to do in order to find your private key and take your money. It's probably not a worthwhile attack for small sums of money, but anything more than a few hundred bitcoins starts to look like a very attractive target.

It works better than a rounding method that repeatedly introduces an error. If I make 1000 trades of $5 each on Bitstamp, while I'm at the 0.26% fee tier, then I'll pay $20 in fees total, or 0.4% of my total trade amount. This is because every individual trade rounds its fees in the same direction (up), and all those tiny errors accumulate. Using a stochastic rounding method, the errors would cancel out, and I'd end up paying $13 plus/minus a few cents. That's much closer to the theoretical ideal amount.


You'd still need to round on the bitcoin side. And if you're using a deterministic rounding method, then the errors on the bitcoin side will accumulate just the same.

Even after quantum computers become commonplace, Bitcoin could still work. Users would just need to move their bitcoins to new addresses that utilize a quantum-resistant signature algorithm. (Probably those addresses will start with a character other than '1'.)
Interestingly, any bitcoins left in the old-style ECDSA addresses might get harvested by quantum computers. I like to say that bitcoins are never really "lost"; they're more like shipwrecked gold: it may be prohibitively expensive to raise them from the ocean floor now, but it needn't always be. In contrast to "lost" coins, coins sent to "burn" addresses like the "Bitcoin eater" address may truly be unrecoverable (or they may be recoverable); it just depends on whether there exists a key pair whose public key hashes to that address.

I like that it doesn't directly talk about mining. Bitcoin mining is no more relevant to Bitcoin users than gold mining is relevant to jewellers.
The only real problem with the points analogy is that newbies will think there's a chance that they may spontaneously receive a bitcoin, just for having a wallet. Maybe instead of describing initial coin distribution as uniformly random across users, you could describe it as working like a lottery: wealthier users can afford to buy more lottery tickets, so they have a greater chance of winning. Then you can just briefly mention that the lottery tickets are actually computing power.

ELI5 version:
Computers are very dumb and can only do things that we humans can explain to them using math. This is why computers are bad at creative things like making art. For the same reason, computers are bad at randomly picking numbers. (Humans are bad at randomly picking numbers, too, but for a completely different reason.) Computers are so bad at randomly picking numbers, in fact, that if a person knows enough about what is going on inside the computer, the person can correctly guess what numbers the computer will "randomly" pick. This is bad for Bitcoin users because it might be possible for someone to guess which private keys a computer will "randomly" pick or even to change the computer in way that makes it pick known numbers. The only way that computers can *truly* pick numbers at random is by using a hardware entropy source. Some random number generators (such as the one in Linux) gather entropy by timing highly unpredictable external events, such as the amount of time between a human user's keystrokes on the keyboard or the amount of time it takes for a hard disk to access data. However, even these sources of entropy do not provide true randomness. One of the only phenomena in the universe that seems to be truly random is the decay of radioactive nuclei. (Not sure this part could be explained to a five-year-old, sorry.) It is possible to attach a scintillation counter or a Geiger-Müller counter to a computer and have the computer use the times between radioactive decay detections as an additional source of entropy for its random number generator. Radioactive decay is something that cannot be predicted at all (at least, not by our current understanding of physics), so numbers picked "randomly" with the help of radioactive decay are much less likely to be guessable.

You shouldn't be downvoted for this. You have a good question. There is certainly a trade-off to consider. Longer block times reduce problems associated with network propagation disparity but also decrease convenience for users. Clearly there is a sweet spot. At Bitcoin's *current* scale, I think the sweet spot is less than ten minutes, but I think all these altcoins are underestimating the problems that their short block intervals would cause if they really became popular on a Visa-like scale. Satoshi planned ahead, and indeed the current crop of core devs seem uninterested in reducing the block interval, even though they could easily do so in a scheduled and orderly manner if they wanted to. The point is, if the altcoins were *actually* superior to Bitcoin, then Bitcoin could simply adopt their changes.

Why isn't Gavin acknowledging the likelihood that many (most?) transactions traversing the Bitcoin network today are fluff? Since it's effectively free to send Bitcoin transactions today, users are indiscriminate about how they use Bitcoin. Need to pay five friends? Send five transactions. Don't bother learning to use `sendmany`; transactions are (effectively) free! But in a future world, where space in the block chain is constrained, users will have to be more judicious (less frivolous) in their usage of transactions.
It's the same thing we saw when gas prices spiked at the end of the last decade. Suddenly the cost of traveling from point A to point B became a relevant factor in people's internal priority evaluations, and we saw people avoiding unnecessary trips or batching multiple errands into one trip to save on gas costs. The same will happen with Bitcoin transactions.
Note that this is not to say that we don't need to raise the block size limit. We do, eventually. But the situation is not as dire or as urgent as Gavin suggests.

X-rays can't tell the difference between solid gold and solid tungsten. (Both absorb x-rays to almost the same degree. You know how doctors use lead blankets to shield extraneous body parts from x-ray machines? Well, gold and tungsten both have densities much greater than that of lead, so they both absorb x-rays even better than lead does, and their densities are almost the same.)
The most reliable way to detect counterfeit gold bars (short of cutting them open) is by using ultrasound. Sound waves travel at a different speed through tungsten than they do through gold. If a bar is solid gold, then a pulse of sound injected at one end of the bar will arrive at the other end as a single peak. However, if the bar contains a tungsten core, then the sound pulse will arrive as two separate peaks. This can be detected, but it requires very precise equipment because the distance that the sound waves travel is so short, and the speeds of sound through the two metals are quite similar.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:
1. Gifter and Giftee each generate a new private key and derive its corresponding public key.
2. Giftee shares his new public key with Gifter.
3. Gifter constructs, signs, and broadcasts a transaction sending some bitcoins to a 2-of-2 multisignature address constructed from Gifter's and Giftee's public keys.
4. Gifter constructs a time-locked, multisignature transaction that redeems the output of the first transaction and sends those bitcoins to the Giftee's address.
5. Gifter signs the multisignature transaction with his private key and sends the partially signed transaction to Giftee.
6. Now Giftee can sign the multisignature transaction with his own private key, thereby making the transaction fully signed, but the transaction is still time-locked, so Giftee must wait before broadcasting it.
While the bitcoins are locked up at the 2-of-2 address, they cannot be moved anywhere else unless both the Gifter and the Giftee sign a different transaction to do so. The Gifter cannot invalidate the multisig transaction because the coins have already been sent to the 2-of-2 address by the first transaction, which has already confirmed in the block chain.

Some people have been holding bitcoins for years now. Every day they have a choice of whether to keep holding them or dump them. If they dump, then they are putting downward pressure on the price. If they hold, then they are not. A falling price induces some people who were previously holding to dump instead, which puts even more downward pressure on the price. If this downward pressure is not counterbalanced by enough people who want to acquire and begin holding bitcoins, then the price will fall.

1. On an airgapped laptop running an Ubuntu Linux LiveDVD, I derived two 256-bit private keys from 144 rolls of a 12-sided die, and I used /dev/random to generate a third 256-bit private key.
1. I encrypted all three private keys with BIP38 using a long and complex passphrase (including uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers).
1. I fed the three BIP38-encrypted private keys into GPG, encrypting them to my public GPG key.
1. I saved the resulting GPG-encrypted file on a USB flash drive.
1. I uploaded a backup of the GPG-encrypted file to my web server, which is hosted on the opposite coast of the United States.
1. I handwrote each of the first two unencrypted keys on separate pieces of paper and personally hand-delivered each piece of paper to two of my close relatives, one paper to each. They live over a thousand miles apart from each other and from me.
1. I decomposed the third private key into four shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme such that any two of the shares could reconstitute the key.
1. I sent each of these shares via GPG-encrypted email to four close friends, one share per friend.
1. I created a 3-of-3 P2SH address using the three public keys and sent my cold-storage funds to that address.
Now, if I should die unexpectedly, my two close family members have to work together and also obtain the participation of two of my closest friends in order to produce a valid signature to spend the funds from my cold storage.

Bitcoin uses ECDSA with 256-bit keys. The only thing in Bitcoin that is 128-bit (and it's not even really in Bitcoin *proper*) is the seeds for some implementations of deterministic wallets, but those seeds can just as easily be 256 bits (or even 512).
I am not talking about a brute-force attack. I am talking about solving the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. That is, given an elliptic curve in a finite field, a generator point, and some other point on the curve (the public key), find the number of times that the generator point must be added to itself to produce the public key. That number of times is the private key. Solving this problem is believed to be intractable on classical computers, but it may be relatively trivial on a quantum computer, much as factoring large integers is believed to be intractable on classical computers but trivial on quantum computers.

You're looking at it wrong. The cost per transaction (including block subsidy) is not fixed. It decreases as the number of transactions increases.

When a miner finds a nonce that completes a block, the miner transmits the block to each of its connected peers. Then those peers tell *their* connected peers about the block, and the block eventually reaches everyone on the network. But "eventually" could take a while. If the block difficulty is so low that a valid block can be found in under a minute, then it's likely that a miner who found a block will find another block (chained to that miner's first block) before the other miners receive the first block. Simultaneously, those other miners will be in the same situation. The net result is that multiple miners each believe their own chain of blocks to be the longest chain because they haven't yet received all the blocks of their competitors, and so each miner continues building on their own chain. A client stuck in the middle of all of this will frequently oscillate between multiple very long chain branches, causing reorganizations of potentially hundreds of blocks in length on that client.

It's because the genesis block is hard-coded into Bitcoin Core, but the output of its coinbase transaction is not actually inserted into the unspent transaction outputs database.

Okay, you do have a good point. Nothing would happen to the value of the dollar in that scenario. The amounts involved are too insignificant. So the next logical question we must ask is whether there is a relationship between the amount granted and the effect on the currency unit's value.
If you were giving away $100,000,000 per person per year, then certainly it is not the case that everyone would then be able to afford mansions, yachts, and high-end sports cars. Do you agree? The prices of those luxuries would adjust to the new standard of value of the dollar.
Now, a less extreme scenario. Let's say you're giving away $10,000 per person per year. Will this have an effect on prices of everyday goods and services? I say, yes, it will. At the present dollar valuation, $10,000/yr isn't really enough to live comfortably. Giving that amount away to everyone every year would put $10,000 even further away from a comfortable lifestyle. So, then you raise the basic income rate to $20,000/yr, but the prices of all the basic necessities just double. It's a cat-and-mouse game. There is no basic income rate you'll be able to set that will make it possible for every citizen to live a comfortable life. But politicians will play the cat-and-mouse game, just as they do with the minimum wage, and the inevitable result is that the basic income approaches infinity, and the value of a dollar approaches zero.

Visa doesn't cover theft. They just handle clawing the money back from the merchants. It's the merchant who ends up footing the bill in the end. They write it down as a "cost of doing business."

It's a reasonable idea, but couldn't we save a lot on costs if we substituted a system of virtual gold? Units of account within this system would have the same economic properties as actual gold (finite, inelastic supply; costly to produce; difficult to counterfeit; a bearer instrument with no counterparty), but they would not have any physical manifestation, instead existing purely as bits of data. The whole system would simulate the real economy of gold but without the overhead of assaying, shipping, and storage. Oh wait, did I just describe Bitcoin? Yes, I did. ;)

When I say it doesn't work in theory, what that means is that there are plausible failure scenarios that the protocol does not (and perhaps cannot) guard against. The 51% attack is one such scenario. To say that something "works in theory" is a strong claim that there are no loose ends that would cause the system to fail. There are scenarios that Bitcoin could get into in which it provably would fail. That is, it can be proven (through logic) that the Bitcoin protocol would fail if these conditions were met, and the conditions are possible to induce in the real world. Now, whether those conditions actually ever arise in practice is another matter entirely.

Hmm, why would this happen? Assuming there's at least one link between the old network and the new network, any transaction broadcast on the new network would make its way to the old network. Splitting the coins into two independently spendable lots would require publishing a transaction that is legal on one block chain but illegal on the other. Unless the hard fork introduces new transaction validity rules, it won't be possible to permanently separate the coins on the two chains. (Any transaction on the new chain could always be copied to the old chain.)

 - Bitcoin will force people to take responsibility for their economic actions. With credit cards, it hardly matters if you enter your card details on a rogue site; if you start getting bogus charges, you just report the card stolen and get a new card, and you're not liable for the charges. But this comes at a steep price that isn't immediately obvious to consumers but is painfully obvious to merchants. Bitcoin turns the whole thing on its side, shifting the responsibility for vetting trade partners onto the consumer. This tremendously reduces the overhead costs in the system. We are eventually going to need a decentralized reputation/rating system, which is another system that the block chain invention enables for the first time in the history of computer science.

Your method has many potential security holes.
* BitAddress could have been altered to serve up malicious code with a very low probability, such that attempting to check it now likely would reveal no problems.
* BitAddress may in fact have a weak pseudo-random number generator. Using a hardware entropy source (radioactive decay, for example) would be safer.
* Even if BitAddress were fine, your browser and/or computer may have been infected by malware that could compromise BitAddress's key generation and/or log the contents of your clipboard for later reporting back to the Internet.
* It is actually very difficult to ensure that data once written to Flash memory are actually erased. Performing a user-level overwrite of the logical media does not ensure that all physical flash memory cells are overwritten. The only way to be certain is to issue a Secure Erase command to the drive controller, and SD cards do not support this.

If you have bitcoins at Coinbase, you won't be able to send them to a mixing service. Coinbase will disallow you to make such a payment. They would get in serious trouble if they allowed you to send your bitcoins to an unregistered address. If you have bitcoins in your own registered wallet, then you won't *want* to send them to a mixing service because you will be prosecuted if you do. The only bitcoins you'll be able to send to a mixing service will be black bitcoins.
As for differing laws around the world, that's not a problem. It will always be possible to register bitcoins to convert them from black to white. So if someone with black bitcoins in Somalia wants to buy goods from a white-market business in the U.S., they can just register their bitcoins, pay the tax, and then spend the newly whitened bitcoins. The U.S. business will not be able to accept payment of black bitcoins. (They could do it under the table, but this would be subject to the same risks as knowingly accepting stolen money today.)

They are not a template. How can you continue making this argument after I've already described exactly what goes into making a Bitcoin pay-to-pubkey-hash address? Here is [an interactive infographic]( to help you understand the process more clearly.


I suspect you're attempting to catch me on a technicality, so I will not wager, but I will answer your challenge for free. But you can't just pick any 128 points in integer space. You have to pick 128 points that lie on the secp256k1 curve and are reachable via EC point multiplication from secp256k1's generator point. If you do that, I will translate those 128 points into Bitcoin pay-to-pubkey-hash addresses.


If the redeem script you gave for this address is indeed correct (I haven't checked it), then no curve point underlies the address. This is possible since the address is a pay-to-script-hash address rather than a pay-to-pubkey-hash address.


In order to redeem those bitcoins, I would need to find two different byte strings whose SHA-1 hashes are equal. This is currently believed to be a hard problem, and I know of no efficient way to do it.

One possible way is for each voter to register a public key when they register to vote (or, almost as good, each voter can be assigned a keypair by the supervisor of elections), and then all the voters run a peer-to-peer application that broadcast-floods votes as they happen (similar to how bitcoin transactions are broadcast-flooded across the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network).

Freshly mined bitcoins could be white bitcoins if the miner's address is registered. Miners in the U.S. will have to pay income tax on their mined coins. (That's already the case under the IRS guidance.) So the cost of the tax will be factored into the miners' economic calculations.
Addendum: Note the implications for mining pools. If the pool operator's address is registered, then all participating miners' payout addresses will have to be registered, as it would be illegal for the pool operator to disburse payouts to unregistered addresses. If the pool operator's address is unregistered, then no participating miner can receive payouts to a registered address, as it would be illegal for the miner to receive black bitcoins at his/her registered address. (The miner might be allowed to pay a tax to whiten the bitcoins he/she receives from the pool's unregistered address.)

Modern governments claim a monopoly over the creation of cash, and this is often said to be the wellspring of their economic power. But the state’s grip on the money supply is weaker than it seems. In the UK, notes and coins adorned with images of the Queen’s head may be the most visible instruments of economic exchange, but they comprise less than a 20th of the money supply. Much of the rest consists of bank deposits – in effect, private debts that financial institutions owe their customers. These deposits function like money; they can be transferred from person to person with the flick of a pen, the wave of a card or even a mobile phone. Yet they are created by private contracts between citizens, not by government fiat.
Writing in these pages, Martin Wolf has argued for the abolition of such “private money”. Our economies would be more stable, he believes, if money creation were left entirely to the state. It is an alluring proposal; the monetary system is fiendishly complicated, and simple solutions to complex problems are often attractive. But it is misguided.
When an account holder gives a bank some cash in return for an increased deposit balance, the bank keeps only a tiny fraction of what it has received in the form of liquid reserves. The rest is lent out to borrowers, who in turn deposit the money, creating still more private money. Because borrowers pay interest, this process leads to the peculiar position that I both receive interest on my current account balance and pay no charges for the bank’s transaction services.
Abolishing private money would stop “fractional reserve” banking in its tracks. Banks would have to match deposits pound for pound with cash instead of loans. Account holders would have to pay charges and would receive no interest on their deposits. The gains from creating money that currently accrue to banks and their customers would instead be pocketed by the state. This could help fund public spending, reducing the government’s borrowing requirement or perhaps eliminating it altogether.
But this is no recipe for monetary stability. On the contrary: it is striking how many of the great inflations of the past were caused by profligate or greedy governments indulging in deficit financing – and destructive wars have been financed this way, too.
Since the 1970s economists have been persuaded that government borrowing should be funded transparently through bond issues and not stealthily through money creation. Allowing the state to pay for its activities by minting fresh cash would undo the progress that has been made.
There is another difficulty with the proposal to ban fractional reserve banking: it is manifestly unenforceable. It is all very well to say that, when money changes hands, it must be government money – notes, coins, or balances in non-interest-bearing accounts that are not used to finance any form of lending. But, how can the government realistically stop balances in investment accounts being reassigned? People cannot be prevented from giving away what is theirs, and the recipients of such largesse cannot be banned from offering goods or services in return.
Perhaps the government could criminalise the use of government-issued notes and coins in a fractional reserve system. But this would not stop the determined financier. In many countries, mobile phone credits are used as a medium of exchange. One day, a successor to Bitcoin might serve that purpose. Or Britons hankering after interest-bearing bank accounts might start using dollars or euros instead of pounds. What is to stop them from lending such things to a bank, or to stop the bank from lending to others in turn? Very little: unless there was a prohibition on any lending on of any good that could be construed as money.
There would be one big difference between this samizdat system of fractional reserve banking and what we have today: it could go broke, because there would be no central bank on hand to bail out the deposit-taking institutions in an emergency. This would encourage prudence. Perhaps we should abolish central banks rather than fractional reserve banking – but that is an argument for another day.
Private money is no menace. And that is for the best – since it could not be wished away.

Look up "Simple Payment Verification" (SPV). The wallet connects to multiple full Bitcoin nodes and uses them as superpeers. It downloads only block headers and transactions pertaining to its own addresses. Its not as secure as a full node, which is why you're given the option to specify a trusted node in the settings, to which the wallet will always connect to be certain that it's not being fooled. For casual amounts of money, though, generally you'll be fine.

Depends on how many outputs make up that 1 BTC. If he's previously received a 0.002-BTC output, then he can pay with "exact change" and not tie up any other funds in his wallet. If he only has exactly one output of 1 BTC, then yes, spending 0.002 with no fee could potentially tie up the whole balance for quite a long time. Technically it's possible to spend unconfirmed change, but up-to-date wallet implementations won't do it because it's not safe in the face of transaction malleability.

Mining is effectively a way to buy bitcoins at a price that is different from the exchange price of bitcoins. If that price is lower than the exchange price, then mining is the better way to acquire bitcoins. If that price is higher than the exchange price, then buying from an exchange is the better way to acquire bitcoins. No future events can change this truth.


How much can it cost to throw a circuit breaker into the "off" position?
I agree that a miner should not sell his equipment if he believes that the market price of bitcoins will rise in the near future (or that the market price of electricity will fall in the near future). If he has fixed costs (such as rent), then he has to add those to the cost of buying bitcoins while his mining equipment sits idle, but it still may be the case that shutting down the mine may be the most profitable course of action.

@_date: 2015-05-06 03:24:42
Frankly, I think the free area should be eliminated entirely, and miners should sort pending transactions in descending order by "fee density," which would be defined as [amount of fees paid] / [transaction size in bytes], truncating this sorted list at whatever point completely fills the block. Transactions with lower fee densities would have to wait for a later block (likely until an off-peak time).

We can agree that you have $100 and I have $300 because we can see the physical dollars in our hands. (For what it's worth, we still have to be able to prove that the bills we hold are not counterfeits.) But Bitcoin doesn't work like that; you can't just look at an address and immediately see how many bitcoins it holds. You have to look through the transaction history and add up all the payments that were made to the address, and you have to check that those payments are valid, which means that you have to check that the previous payments that they redeemed are valid, recursively all the way back to the generation transactions that originally created the coins.
Maybe you're okay with assuming that if the rest of the network thinks a transaction is okay then it's actually okay, but I want to be sure that the rest of the network is following the *consensus rules* that I've agreed to. And in order to check them, I need the complete block chain.

Central banks always treat the symptom of recessions rather than the cause. Recessions cause deflation (due to debt-money destruction due to deleveraging), so central banks print money like mad to keep prices from falling. Of course, this doesn't actually avoid the recession; it just prevents the recession from being apparent in the price indices. Other indices, such as unemployment, paint a starkly different picture.

As a Chromium user on my desktop and a Chrome user on my laptop, I will attest that I have found virtually no differences between the two. The former I compile myself from sources (I'm a Gentoo user), and the latter I receive precompiled from Google. The only difference I've found is that Chrome has a multi-colored logo and updates itself, whereas Chromium has a monochromatic logo and doesn't update itself.
What Google does in their backend servers is of no consequence to me if I'm only ever sending them a blob that I encrypted on my local machine. I will admit that I do not know that Chrome on my laptop isn't some day going to be updated to a version that sprays the decrypted contents of my password database all over the Internet, which is why I would never keep any secrets in it that I want to be safe from the eyes of Google or governments. (But I'm keeping those secrets off of any Internet-connected computer entirely, so 1Password is irrelevant to me for that use case.)
Anyway, I don't mean to disparage 1Password or you for using it. It sounds like a highly usable and well-thought-out product. Maybe if I used it for a while, I would come to find that I didn't want to live without it. But at present, I do not feel compelled to try it.

TCP doesn't solve the Two Generals' Problem. It merely reduces the chance of failure to an acceptably low probability. There is no "general" way (no pun intended) for the two generals to be certain that they have reached a consensus, if the adversary can selectively neutralize messages traveling between them. TCP works because the "adversary" (typically, network congestion) is impartial and not malevolent, and so, with enough retransmissions, eventually progress can be made. Even so, TCP fails pretty hard when even moderate random packet loss is introduced into the path.

Larger blocks are indeed not a solution to on-chain scaling, but neither is SegWit. SegWit does enable better off-chain scaling, but the BU folks don't want off-chain scaling; they want on-chain scaling. What's sad is that they don't realize that increasing the block-size limit does not constitute scaling. We'd need a blockchain sharding mechanism to truly scale on-chain transactions.

Definitely true, though there are scripts out there to stash arbitrarily large data files in the block chain and retrieve them. People don't do this because it's expensive to do, but if it were free to do, it would be done a lot. Rationale: free, unlimited, super-redundant storage is very desirable.


You're assuming the consequent. The reason it's difficult to do this now is because hardly anyone wants to do it. If stashing large amounts of data in the blockchain were free, there would be tools developed to make it as easy as drag-and-drop.


Pruning only works on data that is stored using prunable outputs (i.e., using `OP_RETURN`). Mass data storage applications would not store their data in this way, as they would not want it pruned. Instead, they would store data in such a way as to bloat the UTxO set, to ensure that their data remains accessible indefinitely.

So paying a fee of *F* would allow your transaction to be located within a mined block at any offset less than T(*F*). If the block is of size *S*, then the probability that your transaction will be included in the block is T(*F*)/*S*. If you want a higher probability, then pay a higher fee. Is this accurate?
The problem I see with this strategy is that it's impossible to know at the time you build a transaction how large the next block will be, so you cannot target a specific probability for inclusion. (This problem is equally present in the fixed block size scenario, as one cannot know when building a transaction how many transactions will be competing for space in the block.)


So this would be a new consensus rule? A block is invalid if it contains any transaction whose fee is *F* and whose location in the block is greater than T(*F*)? I suppose this could work, though it presents a new complication, which you rightly pointed out: there then needs to be a consensus algorithm for determining the function T(*f*).

Except that it won't work like this. Arbitrage always has the effect of bringing market prices in line with each other. If Circle is buying more bitcoins than they're selling, then they will reduce their price to below market to restore equilibrium.

According to [GBTC's 6 March 2015 Information and Disclosure Statement]( the "Redemption Basket Bitcoin Amount" is:


In other words, a Basket is 100 shares of the fund. Initially, each share of the fund represented 1/10th of a bitcoin, so one Basket was equivalent to 10 bitcoins.
Additionally, the disclosure also states:


So it would seem that the number of bitcoins represented by one Basket will only decrease, so 10 bitcoins is an upper bound.

You must be using the word "scaling" to refer to something different than I am. Doubling the effective block-size limit (or even octupling it) does not achieve scaling. Scalability is related to algorithmic complexity analysis. Linear scaling is not going to work; communications technology just isn't far enough advanced to support the entire world's population using Bitcoin in its present form. It will be in another two to three decades, but we can't wait that long.


This is true, but this isn't good enough for the BU crowd. They aren't happy with conducting the bulk of their transactions off-chain.


I agree, but this doesn't help bring the BU folks back into the fold. Are you prepared to just say, "Fork them"? Splitting Bitcoin into two will result in two much weaker currencies, the sum of which will not be even close to equaling what we have now.

The U.S. absolutely does have person-to-person transfers. Most banks will do it. It's not instant though; it takes at least until the morning of the next business day, and if either the sending bank or the receiving bank is dragging its feet, it can take one or two more business days. Very few banks expose this functionality via their online banking interface. Capital One 360 is one notable bank that does, and they don't charge anything for it. Other banks, such as Bank of America, will do it, but you have to find someone at the bank who knows anything at all, and typically they'll charge you for the privilege.

I think it would be less, but I also think there would be less need of charity, as the standard of living would rise across the board without the government sapping so much productivity out of the economy.


Probably the same thing we did *before* the New Deal instituted all these government social welfare programs.


There's no such thing as an optional tax. But if the government charged for services rendered, as any other business does, then I think most likely fewer people would subscribe to the government's services, as they could find higher-quality, lower-priced alternatives elsewhere.


If government lacks the power and legitimacy to force individuals to subscribe to its services, then I really don't have to trust it to manage its cash flow intelligently. If it's stupid, it goes out of business.


Yes, I do, with a proviso: this only works if we eliminate corporate limitations on personal liability. When a corporation can do whatever it wants and its executives cannot be held personally liable for the corporation's actions, we run into all sorts of trouble. This is another one of those cases where government creates a problem and then masquerades as the problem's only solution. Limited-liability corporations are a construct of monopoly government. They couldn't exist in that form in a free society.

It wouldn't be that hard to spin up a new server, write a simple script on it to collect withdrawal requests from users, and write those withdrawal requests into a file.

Then the list can be used to construct a withdrawal transaction against the cold wallet's funds. It would take one coder half a day to put this system in place, and it would go a long way toward reassuring frantic users.

You are factually incorrect. There are [numerous types]( of ACH transactions. One of these is the "PPD" (Prearranged Payment &amp; Deposit Entry).

The type of ACH transaction that allows an end-user to push funds to another account not owned by that user is the "CIE" (Customer Initiated Entry).

"Micro" is the SI prefix meaning 10^(-6), which is "one millionth." For better or worse, the community does seem to be rallying around "bit" as shorthand for "microbitcoin," even though "millibit" was already shorthand for "millibitcoin." So now we're in the ludicrous position of having 1 millibit = 1000 bits = 0.001 bitcoins and 1 kilobit = 1000 bits = 0.001 bitcoins. In other words "millibit" and "kilobit" both mean the same thing now. Way to go, Bitcoin community.

Great response!! So thorough! If ChangeTip hadn't pissed their pants over BitLicense, I'd be sending you some beer money right now.
Most of the advantages you cited aren't compelling enough to me to overcome the disadvantage of having to use an extra piece of software, which won't even work on my main machine (KDE/Linux).


I just do this in my terminal:
    head -c12 /dev/random | base64


This is a great consideration, and as a security-paranoid user, I can certainly appreciate this.




Not of much interest to me, though I could store these items in KWallet if I wanted to, though then I'd have the aforementioned clipboard exposure, and they wouldn't be synced to other devices.


I don't understand why *anyone* prefers Firefox to Chrome/Chromium. Firefox used to be relevant before Apple forked KHTML to make WebKit. Now that we have WebKit, Gecko is an anachronism.


I'd just make a separate user in Chrome if I wanted to do this. Then all my bookmarks and cookies and history would be separate too.


So does KWallet on my Linux system and Keychain on my Mac.


That's another great consideration, though for secrets that sensitive (such as my Bitcoin cold storage private key), I use separate encryption (e.g., BIP38) and only input them into my Internet-connected machine in encrypted form.


It seems like it, but you're right that I haven't reviewed the source code myself. Have you reviewed 1Password's source code and compiled it from source yourself on all devices where you use it?


True on my Mac. However, on my phone, I can disable auto-update in the Play Store, and on my desktop I run Chromium, which can't update itself and has to be updated through the system's package manager (Portage in my case).


Isn't this also true of 1Password's browser extensions?

I was assuming a technical failure, not a theft. A seed only needs to be backed up once, and then it is impossible to ever lose any keys derived from that seed. If Bitstamp is generating independent keys for each depositor, then they would need to back up continuously or risk losing some keys in the event of hardware failure or software crash.

To add to what said: there already exists a [Bitcoin URI Scheme]( And in fact the "bitcoin:" scheme has been [added to HTML5]( and subsequently [whitelisted in Chromium]( (the open-source parent project of Google Chrome). This means that if you have a wallet application installed which has registered itself as a handler for "bitcoin:" URIs, then clicking on a "Pay with Bitcoin" button on a web page (such as a BitPay invoice) will launch your wallet application with the recipient's address and payment amount already filled in.

I could have sworn that Bitcoin used to work like this. There was a fee schedule that was inversely related to the amount of space remaining in the current block, such that approaching the block size limit required asymptotically increasing fees. It would not have been possible to consume the last byte of space in a block because to do so would have required an infinite fee. I haven't seen any mention of this in a long time, though, so I wonder if it was an early proposal that was rejected or an early requirement that was dropped.

There is no programmatic way to know whether an output is redeemable (if no input script has ever redeemed an output with the same output script).

Storage densities are increasing at a far faster rate than the human population. Bitcoin's transaction rate is ultimately limited by the global human population — there is a natural limit to how many financial transactions each human being can make each day. Once we reach saturation, the Bitcoin transaction rate will climb only as quickly as the human population grows, but storage densities will continue increasing per [Kryder's Law](

Oh, I agree that we need to know who owns which bitcoins (pseudonymously anyway), but we don't need to retain information about every petty transaction. We really only need to retain aggregate accounting. For instance, you might charge all your purchases for a month to a bitcoin-denominated credit card and then make one on-blockchain transaction to settle up. Records of the individual coffee and lunch purchases can stay in the card issuer's database and do not need to be forever enshrined in the block chain.

Good for now but unlikely to keep up after the maximum block size limit is lifted. I was running a full node on a Raspberry Pi last summer, and it was taking about 2 minutes to verify each block.

RBF is a mining and relay policy that allows nodes to accept and relay transactions that conflict with (i.e., spend the same coins as) transactions already in their memory pools. RBF is irrelevant if your first transaction attempt has too low a priority even to propagate the network. It's always been the case that you could try again with the same inputs but different outputs. RBF only makes it possible for your second attempt to *replace* your first attempt in other nodes' mempools (if your first attempt even made it that far).

Absolutely. And what is the incentive for a miner when selecting which transactions to include in a block? Clearly you're right that miners are incentivized to include transactions. That's why they only rarely mine empty blocks. What incentivizes them to do this? Transaction fees. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect miners to adopt mining policies that maximize transaction fees (all else being equal). RBF is what results when miners implement a policy of selecting whichever set of non-conflicting transactions has the highest fee density. Therefore, we should expect RBF to be the norm once transaction fees amount to any more than a negligible income for miners.

Using a new Bitcoin address for each payment received is good practice, but it doesn't affect coin selection.

If it were possible to have reliable zero-confirmation transactions, we wouldn't need a blockchain in the first place.

That miners have always been able to implement RBF. It's not a consensus policy. So introducing "opt-in RBF" doesn't change the rules of the system at all. You were right to say that it doesn't kill zero-conf, but you may have been overlooking that zero-conf has always been "dead" since RBF has always been allowed.
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:23:06
I'm not meaning to troll; this is a serious question. Why are we waiting for 95% signaling on SegWit? Why not activate it right now? It's a soft fork. Users are not affected by it if they don't opt in. Users can choose to ignore it if they wish. There is no risk of splitting the currency. So why do we wait for 95%? What's the risk in activating now?
**Edit:** Oh, I think I remember now that I'm thinking about it more. If less than half of the hashpower uses the new rules, then SegWit outputs would be spendable by anyone. So there *is* a risk of splitting the currency if only a minority of hashpower supports SegWit.

Time bomb? Quit blowing smoke. The block size limit does need to increase, but Bitcoin won't suddenly become useless if it doesn't. Users will simply be forced to economize. If sending a letter through the postal service were free, we might send letters willy-nilly, but because it costs a non-negligible amount of money, we're more judicious about how we utilize the postal service. The same will be true of Bitcoin. Presently people send transactions as though they're free, but behavior will change when people have to start considering the overhead of their transactions.

Pressure from alts could potentially kill Bitcoin if neither BU nor SegWit can secure a supermajority of the hashing power. It seems both sides are digging in and calcifying. I think we need a new proposal that features neither "emergent consensus" nor accounting tricks.

My social circles are clearly quite different from yours. I see almost all (like 95%) of my Bitcoin friends parroting the "Blockstream Core, Inc." conspiracy theories and cheerleading for Bitcoin Unlimited.
How do you arrive at the "3%" figure? I see significant (almost majority) hashpower running BU. I know that miners are not the rulers of Bitcoin and that the actual direction Bitcoin takes depends on the immeasurable "economic majority," so I don't necessarily fear a majority of hashpower forking itself off into irrelevance, but it sounds like you're asserting that 3% of the Bitcoin economy backs BU, and I'd like to know how you're figuring that.

The LevelDB databases (`chainstate` and `blocks/index`) haven't always been platform-independent.

Some miners presently mine *empty* blocks precisely because they've determined that the marginal added revenue they could collect from transaction fees is not worth the higher risk of losing the block propagation race.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:09:12


Hmm, I'm going to have to research these merits you speak of. I presently see no intelligent reason to split transactions into two separate data structures, especially since doing so actually consumes *more* storage overall (to store an extra hash per SegWit input and to store an index of all the witnesses). I've read that SegWit can reduce the data that needs to be transmitted to nodes who don't care to check all the signatures in the block chain, but this saving could be had without detaching the signatures from the transactions.

7.125 billion people, each broadcasting an average of 2 transactions per day, each of which must be received by each and every node and transmitted an average of once, and each of which is 500 bytes on average, works out to 1.32 Gbps (gigabits per second) of Internet bandwidth required, or 660 Mbps in each direction. How many broadband markets today offer a service tier that fast? Just Google Fiber, right?

Be careful. The halving will also severely cripple the Bitcoin network for a few weeks to several months, due to the sudden and severe drop-off in mining power. (Most miners won't be profitable at 12.5 BTC per block, so they'll simply shut down and wait for higher prices or lower difficulty. This will cause the block interval to lengthen dramatically, and this will cause blocks to be full, and this will cause a panic.)

Let's not set such situations aside. This particular scenario is *the* mechanism by which Bitcoin will take root. I'd like to offer a case in point. I get my car serviced at a garage that has a sign posted on the wall by the register that advertises 5% off when you pay in cash (as opposed to via a plastic card). I take advantage of this offer whenever I can, and I have verbally expressed my support for cutting out the middlemen, to which the clerk agreed. Offers like this one are going to become more common as credit-card processors grow still greedier. (Visa just recently announced raising their interchange fees, even though they're already the highest among the major card networks.) When a merchant has already been pushed to the point of offering a price break for avoiding the credit card processors, logically it should become easier for that merchant to adopt cryptocurrency, as handling crypto has lower friction than handling cash, and customers might genuinely prefer to pay in crypto for 5% off versus paying in cash for 5% off since crypto is easier to use than cash (large payments can be made without stacks of bills that need to be counted out; there's no cumbersome change to carry around after the transaction or forfeit on the spot simply to avoid the hassle; there is no chance of counterfeit bills being tendered).

The only files you actually need are the `blocks/blk*.dat` files, as these contain the raw block data, and `wallet.dat`, which contains your keys and wallet transactions. The `blocks/rev*.dat` files contain the "undo" information that is necessary to roll back blocks in case of a reorganization; this information can be reconstructed from the raw block data. The `chainstate/*` files are an index of unspent transaction outputs; this index can be reconstructed from the raw block data. If you delete everything but `blocks/blk*.dat` and `wallet.dat`, then next time you start Bitcoin Core, start it with the `-reindex` option. It'll take several hours to rebuild the `blocks/rev*.dat` and `chainstate/*` files, but you won't be redownloading anything.

Are those connection speeds *symmetric*? A full node has to transmit *at least* one copy of everything it receives, or else it's not helping the network but rather hurting it. So you need fast upstream bandwidth too, not just downstream.

I'll accept all your points as valid except this one. I personally love IPv6 addressing on my home LAN because every device gets an IP address that is globally unique and routable. No bullshit with NATs and port forwarding, just networking the way it was intended. But yeah, in an enterprise environment, you likely wouldn't want most of your internal hosts to be globally reachable anyway, so IPv6 wins you nothing.
@_date: 2019-03-09 07:35:41
One obvious way that you can clearly tell the difference is that you can have multiple IPv6 servers on your home network all listening for incoming connections on the same port number, and they can all be reachable from the Internet. In a NAT setup you can have at most one LAN host mapped to each distinct port number on the router, but in a native IPv6 setup, the router doesn't determine to which LAN host each incoming connection should be forwarded; rather, the originator of the connection determines this by which destination address it puts on its packets.

Hmm, by "private networks," do you mean networks with no Internet gateway?

I myself was opposed to SegWit SF for a long time on the basis that full nodes would silently be reduced to SPV-level security.

On the contrary, I am intimately familiar with the implementation details of SegWit. This is why I understand that, while SegWit does effectively increase on-chain capacity, it does not increase the "plain old" block-size limit, so older software, alternative implementations, and users who have no option to use SegWit or simply wish not to use it will not have direct access to the additional capacity. They will only benefit indirectly as some other transactions migrate into the new capacity accessible through SegWit.
This evidently is "not good enough" for the BU supporters. They do not want to rely on SegWit to achieve greater on-chain capacity. They want the plain old block-size limit to be raised. And their faction is growing dangerously large. I fear that Core may lose this war of ideas, and if that happens, I foresee that the great Bitcoin experiment will fail.

It's the same block chain. Any coins valid on Bitcoin's block chain before the first 2MB block will be valid on Bitcoin Classic's chain until spent there.

I would presume so.

Bitcoin Core already implements exactly the features you're looking for. You can set a maximum fee to pay, and you can set your time preference in the form of the number of blocks on average that you're willing to wait to have your transaction mined. The wallet will pick an appropriate fee, subject to your maximum, such that there's a 90% likelihood that your transaction will be mined within the number of blocks you specified. So you really can "set it and forget it" and never "deal with that crap" again.

Miners cannot accept a transaction that should be rejected by the protocol, but they *can* reject a transaction that should be accepted by the protocol. That's what we're seeing here. Most miners would reject a SegWit transaction, even though the protocol says it should be accepted.

You have it backwards. The technical debt already exists, in the form of the least efficient data structure ever devised by computer scientists: the blockchain.

The only reason you would need to commit a Lightning channel to the chain is if you have a dispute with your peer.

Without a "4-to-6" gateway, hosts on an IPv4-only LAN utilizing RFC-1918 site-local addressing would be unable to reach IPv6-only hosts on the Internet. Rather than requiring such a gateway, why not assign the hosts IPv6 addresses as well? My computer, on which I'm currently typing this, has one RFC-1918 site-local IPv4 address (in 192.168.0/23) and one globally routable IPv6 address (in 2601:186:xxxx:xxxx::/64).
I would expect LANs to continue using RFC-1918 site-local IPv4 addresses for many decades to come, but eventually there will be no IPv4-only hosts left, at which time assigning IPv4 addresses will become pointless.

Spending an unconfirmed output isn't always intentional, ill or otherwise. If that's the only output you have in your wallet, that's what you'll spend.


There is no "standard," and the vendor and customer have opposing goals regarding the fee, so a requirement by the vendor would then be a second point of negotiation in the transaction, which IMHO makes the whole thing too much trouble to bother with.


It was at an acquaintance's restaurant. I think we ended up with my giving him my contact info, and he just trusted that my transaction would eventually confirm. (It did later that night.)
@_date: 2019-03-23 04:57:20


Actually it can be, effectively. You can sign and publish a transaction that spends an output that itself is not yet confirmed. If that prior output never confirms, then your new transaction effectively spent from an "empty account."


No. It's also possible that a transaction will never confirm even if its spender had no intent to defraud. It is possible that a transaction carries such a low fee that it gets evicted from all miners' mempools before any miner includes it into a block. In that case, even though the transaction was broadcast and observed in the network, and even though there was no attempt to double spend it, nevertheless it may never confirm.


Yeah, that's an okay workaround. However, I myself have been in a situation where a transaction I sent at the beginning of a dine-in meal still had not confirmed by the time I had finished eating and was ready to leave. I couldn't simply offer to pay in cash instead, as my transaction probably would eventually confirm, so I and the restaurateur were stuck in a hard place.

Anyway, what Veriblock *should* have done is to build a single Merkle tree of hashes in each block period, with the leaves of the tree being the hashes that they are presently putting in `OP_RETURN` outputs. Then they could either: (A) broadcast one transaction after each block is found, where that transaction contains one `OP_RETURN` output containing the root of the Merkle tree that has built up since the previous transaction was broadcast; or (B) broadcast a replacement transaction, using Replace-By-Fee, each time a new document to be timestamped is received by the service, where the transaction contains one `OP_RETURN` output containing the root of the Merkle tree being built up in the current block. Either way means only one transaction per block is needed. Method A is cheaper, but method B has one block-time less latency. Bonus points if the service uses both methods and lets customers choose whether to pay more for lower latency.

Printing money would be more honest if the government didn't tax us on the nominal capital "gains" on investments that occur solely because the unit of account (dollars) is becoming worth less because more of it exists. For example, I might buy 10 ounces of gold today and then sell it a year from now for 10% more dollars. How much of that nominal 10% increase was because the gold appreciated, and how much was because the dollar depreciated? The government will tax me on the whole 10%. *That* is dishonest.

Earning fee revenue on Lightning Network seems to be something of a pipe dream, at least at present. Every time someone closes one of my channels, it costs me about 40¢. It takes me a *month* to earn that much in routing fees across *all* of my channels. Even LNBIG, the biggest player in Lightning, has spent *far* more on transaction fees than he has earned in routing fees.
So my intention in getting into the Lightning Network in a big way isn't to turn a profit but to spare myself the large future expense of getting in after it's "too late," which I believe will happen suddenly and without warning. We are living on borrowed time right now.

This is completely incorrect.
Incoming IPv6 connections are addressed directly to the machine running the Bitcoin node. They do pass through many routers on their way from origin to destination, but all of those routers, including the "home router" at the end of the route, merely examine the destination IPv6 address to know how to route the packets. There is no network/port address translation (NAT/PAT), so there is no examining of port numbers by the routers, and there is no "port forwarding" to set up. This is IPv6's big win over IPv4. It puts the Internet back to how it was intended to be. NAT has been a massive crutch and headache for so long.

"Over the counter" means your offer never goes onto an exchange's order book. Rather, a person at the exchange will try to find someone else willing to take the other side of your desired trade. OTC is usually used for large trades when participants don't want to move the price on the order book directly. It doesn't make sense for someone like you, interested in smaller trades.

Every UTxO that gets spent is destroyed, as it is no longer "unspent" and thus is no longer a UTxO.

Hmm, why do you say the result will be the same? The result of a premined scamcoin is that the originator of the coin gets to have a large amount of the coin for free. No one has gotten to have a large amount of bitcoins for free. Satoshi mined a lot before many others took a serious interest, but theoretically he still had to compete on a level playing field to mine his coins. Contrast with premined shitcoins, which do not have a level playing field at their launch.

True, though there can still be an IPv6 firewall that needs to be configured to allow the incoming connections through.
I have multiple incoming IPv6 connections to my Bitcoin node. I use a tiny Linux box as my home network router, and I do block all incoming IPv6 connections except for the ones on the ports I'm explicitly allowing. You're right, though, that there is no address translation. My Bitcoin node does have a public, globally routable IPv6 address despite being "behind" my router.

Wrong. If your debt has an interest rate that is lower than the rate of return you can earn in a savings account, then you should delay repaying the debt for as long as possible. Back in the early to mid 2000s, maxing out credit cards with 0% promo rates and putting the proceeds into savings accounts paying 5% APY was a good way to make some extra money. Some people did this to extreme degrees, having total debts over $100,000.

The problem is that the capital gains tax is assessed on the gain in *nominal* value of the bitcoins (i.e., as measured in terms of the value of the U.S. dollar), not the gain in *real* value of the bitcoins (i.e., as measured against a basket of physical goods). So under the current system, if the value of the dollar falls by half (and therefore the price of bitcoins doubles), the government will tax the "increase" in value of the bitcoins even though they didn't gain any additional real value.

"You're not thinking fourth-dimensionally!"
In the future, centralized exchanges will coordinate direct BTC transfers between customers' Lightning wallets. It'll all be automated, such that you simply need to keep running the exchange's app to maintain your orders on the exchange's order book. When it's time to execute a trade, the exchange would obtain a Lightning invoice of the appropriate amount from the buyer's app and relay it to the seller. The seller's app would pay the buyer's invoice, whereupon the seller's app would learn the pre-hash image corresponding to the buyer's invoice. The seller's app would then present the pre-hash image to the exchange as proof of payment, and the exchange would transfer fiat from the buyer's exchange account to the seller's. Notice that the exchange is only ever in custody of the fiat; the bitcoins move directly between customers.

Unfortunately there is no way for routing nodes to discriminate chat messages from ordinary payments because the payload is encrypted.

This is true. However, this does not mean you have to use the exact same software. I am a strong proponent of there being multiple implementations of Bitcoin that share no code in common.

What if *both/all* conflicting transactions are "legit"? The biggest use cases for "first-seen-**unsafe**" RBF are (1) augmenting fees on a pending transaction if it's not confirming quickly enough ("bumping") and (2) adding more payees to a pending transaction ("batching"). Both of these very useful use cases are hampered by the "first-seen-safe" policy. (They're still possible in most instances but are grossly less efficient than they would be without the FSS policy.)


Even if FSS is the default policy (I'm not sure either), it's contrary to each miner's rational self-interest. All profit-motivated miners (i.e., the vast majority) would switch to the profit-maximizing policy.
FSS cannot be a consensus rule (for the reason I gave in my previous reply), so the best we can do is to wax philosophic about how miners could/should be charitable custodians of the network, but that's only an exercise in mental masturbation since there's no way to ensure that it actually happens in the real world.

Fun piece of trivia for you: you know why a bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places and not to six or nine as our conventions would dictate? (We group denominations at powers of 1000, or groups of three digits.) Traditional Japanese number systems group denominations at powers of 10000. They would say there are "1,0000,0000" satoshis in one bitcoin. It's our Western convention of making groups of *three* digits that leads to the unsightly "100,000,000" satoshis per bitcoin. So there is actually already a precedent in Bitcoin for doing things the Japanese way, not the European/American way.

Unfortunately for merchants, that's actually not true.

Vanilla Bitcoin is better suited to "slow" payments like paying your credit-card bill at the end of each monthly billing cycle. Paying with bitcoins at retail points of sale is better accommodated by payment networks (e.g., Visa, PayPal, Lightning Network, Liquid, etc.) with which you would settle up your account balance later/eventually in an on-chain transaction.

Twice the block size, perhaps. I know I will continue to run my full node even after deployment of 2MB blocks, though this will put my monthly bandwidth consumption above the level that Comcast caps in other regions. (I'm thankful to live in a Comcast region that is not capped.)


Different kind of "centralization" (that's service centralization versus mining centralization). I am concerned about this as well, but I disagree that it's a more serious concern. The most serious centralization concern I have is with regard to the miners. They are the gatekeepers. Second-tier service providers will be an open market with lots of competition. It's true that the average Bitcoin user will have to conduct their transactions through a second-tier service provider, but there is no reason to suspect that such service providers will become so centralized as to become abusive.


I can see your point, though I think its validity depends on what you value about Bitcoin. If you value autonomy and censorship resistance (which I do too), then you're correct: a Bitcoin that is only accessible via a second-tier service provider is not "Bitcoin" at all. However, if your primary value in Bitcoin is that it is better money (thanks to its fixed supply) than your nationality's rampantly inflationary fiat currency, then being forced to access it through an intermediary isn't a deal-breaker for you.


I agree entirely. Bitcoin needs an "ingenious and unexpected development" in order to survive. I am on the lookout for proposals that truly address the scalability problem. "Larger blocks" is not such a proposal. Sharding the blockchain would be.


Really. Please do tell, which altcoins have their shit together? None of them have actually solved the blockchain scalability problem, which is that it simply isn't feasible for every node in the network to observe every transaction in the network.

You can literally generate a private key without using a computer. All you need is some coins. Maybe 8 of them. Throw them up in the air. Pick them up from left to right, writing down a 0 for a head and a 1 for a tail. Repeat this process 32 times (enough to get 256 bits). You now have a private key. To turn it into a Bitcoin address, you'll need to use a computer, though it can be a computer that is booted from a flash drive that you never connect to the Internet while the flash drive is connected.
Also you should check out my [Bitcoin diceware]( program for the TI-89 graphing calculator. It'll let you use any kind of coin or die and ask you for enough flips/rolls to gather 256 bits of entropy and then give you your private key in Base58check and your Bitcoin address. Of course, you might not want to use my program unless you trust me, which you shouldn't. Better to do it all by hand.

You're right. And Bitcoin is actually even more extreme than oil and gold, as incremental investments in extractive capacity don't increase extractive output. Bitcoin is the first commodity with a perfectly inelastic supply. With most commodities, when their market price starts to rise, additional productive capacity is brought online, which increases the rate of supply and dampens the price rise. Not so with Bitcoin. When its market price starts to rise, additional mining capacity is brought online, but this doesn't increase the mining rate (not for long anyway). All it does is increase the value proposition of Bitcoin by making it more secure, which in turn increases demand and increases the price even more. The perfectly inelastic supply of Bitcoin is why we repeatedly see price booms in Bitcoin that traditional commodities do not experience.

Indeed, LNBIG is not coming anywhere close to breaking even. The biggest expense for a Lightning node operator is mining fees, and node implementations right now have severely suboptimal fee characteristics. For instance, it usually costs me around 40¢ every time a peer force-closes one of my channels. It would take literally years to earn that much in routing fees from a single channel at current transaction volumes. So running a Lightning node is severely cash-flow negative.
I would guess that [1ML]( has the best database of Lightning node data. There is no way to discern the particular split of inbound versus outbound capacity of any node, as that information is not public. (It would constitute a privacy leak if it were.)

The risk to Bitcoin brokers of accepting credit cards is what stops thieves from buying bitcoins with stolen credit cards right now. As many so often complain, it's nearly impossible to buy bitcoins with a credit card. This is precisely because of the high potential for abuse. Brokers can't afford to cover all the fraudulent transactions that would surely occur if they were to accept credit cards.
All of this would change if credit card transactions could not be charged back to Bitcoin brokers. Then they would not have to cover the costs of fraud directly. Instead, the credit card processors would have to charge the brokers increased transaction fees to cover all the fraud, and there's probably no fee they could charge that would cover all of it, so they'd simply stop servicing the Bitcoin brokers. In other words, there's no way it could work, which was my original point.

Even after SegWit activates, you won't have to use it. Your software won't have to know about it. You can literally behave as though it doesn't exist, and the only difference to you will be that you're paying unnecessarily high fees.

Why? Then each block would be worth only one-sixtieth what a block is worth presently. I.e., you'd need 180 blocks to have the same protection from reversal as you get with three blocks now. On top of that, you'd have all the inefficiencies of miners constantly colliding rather than building on each other's blocks because blocks can't be instantly distributed across the P2P network. Satoshi wasn't a fool for choosing a 10-minute block interval. If you want quicker confirmations, you should be using a higher-layer protocol like Lightning Network, not a bare blockchain.

I think means that prices are a floating abstraction, a ratio of two unitless values, the market value of a good or service relative to the market value of some arbitrarily chosen but fixed unit of account. For instance, the same bottle of soda might be $1.25 or ¥135 or 28400₫. They all represent the same value, but the number is essentially on an arbitrary scale that relates to how many units of the currency exist and how much demand exists for the currency.

Solar, wind, and hydro are all very easy to shut down when demand is low.
Solar: Simply disconnect the PV cells. An open circuit carries no current.
Wind: Angle the blades so they do not bite into the wind. Disconnect the turbine. Windmill stops turning.
Hydro: Shut off the valves to the turbine. Water stops flowing. Turbine stops spinning.
Paying people to consume electricity that you could simply not be producing is madness. I have no doubt that it happens in Europe, but I'm sure it's because of bizarre requirements imposed by governments rather than any technical reason.

Indeed, one of crypto's greatest threats to monopoly government is that crypto so efficiently and effectively undermines governments' ability to forcibly extract wealth from the populace.

It actually depends on the ratio of witness to non-witness data in the block. If the block is heavy on transactions that require multiple signatures, then blocks can be much larger than 1.7 MB.

What does "first seen" even mean? The whole reason we needed a block chain in the first place was that a decentralized network could not otherwise reliably converge on any particular interpretation of the ordering in which conflicting sets of transactions were introduced into the network. If "first seen" could reliably and universally be determined without needing to mine a block, then we would not need to mine any blocks.

There are distributed consensus algorithms that do not use a block chain. [Paxos]( is a classic example. The key achievement of the PoW blockchain data structure is that it solves the *Byzantine* Generals Problem. (The "Byzantine" qualifier means that the generals may lie to each other.) A "private club" of 10 companies can use an algorithm like Paxos to maintain consensus on a shared state machine (e.g., a database). This is possible because any bad actor (a lying general) can be easily identified and kicked out of the group by the other group members. The strength of a blockchain is that it continues to work correctly even though malicious actors cannot be excluded from participating. A "private blockchain" can control access — that's what makes it *private* — so a blockchain is actually overkill, and a standard (non-Byzantine) consensus algorithm will suffice (and will perform much better).
**Addendum:** There is a Byzantine variant of Paxos, but it doesn't solve the Sybil problem like PoW blockchain does.

Would you explain what you think SegWit does? I think you have an inaccurate understanding of it.
SegWit doesn't create the appearance of new coins. That's what a fractional reserve system would do. SegWit really is just a fix for transaction malleability, a fix for quadratic signature validation, an efficiency enhancement for hardware wallets, and a new way to upgrade Bitcoin's scripting language in the future. The devs threw in a chain capacity increase as a compromise. But nowhere in SegWit are the economics of coin supply changed, so I don't see how you've concluded that SegWit introduces fractional reserve.

You really think OTC trades have no net effect on the market? They still affect overall supply and demand. If you buy a million coins OTC, you're going to move the price (indirectly) on the exchanges because the seller will no longer be looking to sell those coins, so there will be less resistance to prices rising on the exchanges. (If the seller hadn't sold to you, they could have sold on the exchanges to keep the price in check, but now they can't do that.)

is talking about the *covert* form of AsicBoost. Empty blocks and blocks with strange orderings of transactions are indeed evidence that covert AsicBoost is in use. (Empty blocks can also just be due to "spy mining.")
It is indeed quite plausible that Antpool's spam-filled blocks are because they need to craft a specific prefix on their block's Merkle tree root hash so that their covert AsicBoost can work efficiently. It's harder to do this with real transactions, as the only variability to play with there is omitting them or reordering them (both of which have challenges due to inter-transaction dependencies). Filling a block with spam transactions allows Antpool to replace the transactions with other transactions at will, until they get the Merkle tree root hash prefix they're looking for.

Monero's implementation is fatally flawed, as it suffers from the infinitely growing accumulator problem. In other words, the minimum amount of data you need to store in perpetuity to be a fully validating Monero node grows forever in proportion to all Monero usage since its inception, whereas that amount for a Bitcoin node (pruning but still fully validating) only grows in proportion to the number of current users of the system, which is essentially (ignoring lost coins) limited by the world population size at any given moment. Monero is a cool crypto demonstration, but it isn't sustainable in the long run.

Ahh, okay, well I might not entirely agree with that. It depends on what you mean by "set the price."

If someone puts a private key *in* their dead man's switch message, they're doing it wrong.

Bonus points if you use nLockTime so the pre-signed transaction cannot be posted to the block chain until after a certain date.

I'd like that too. I've been searching through my Gmail, trying to find threads from the old bitcoin-dev listserv, as I'm thinking that's where one particularly strongly worded exchange occurred, but I'm not coming up with anything. I also searched back through my posts on BitcoinTalk, but I didn't find anything there either. It must have been on Reddit, but I don't know of any effective way to find examples here. So, I guess, disregard my request for clarification.
Regardless of whether the Core devs' attitudes are that Bitcoin Core *is* the "specification" of Bitcoin's consensus algorithm, I am still of the opinion that the specification is rightly what we believe it to be and not necessarily what is actually implemented. Furthermore, I believe it is still in the best interests of the Bitcoin ecosystem that we in the community develop multiple full-node implementations from scratch to guard against critical bugs in Bitcoin Core.
In particular, I believe that Bitcoin Core *can* be out of compliance with the (as yet unwritten) specification. If there are no other popular implementations, then the easy "fix" is to change the specification to match Bitcoin Core's misbehavior. But if we have multiple popular implementations, then Bitcoin Core would need to be fixed to match the specification. This latter scenario is far preferable to my sensibilities.

What the fuck? This article was clearly not written by an engineer (or even by someone with a modicum of observational skills).
The "Door Close" button absolutely does something: it preempts the elevator's default behavior of waiting with its doors open for more passengers to board before it continues on to other requested stops. Maybe this is only noticeable if the elevator's configured wait time is greater than a couple of seconds, but the button is definitely not a no-op.
And the sidewalk crossing button is not "wired to nothing" either. In some cities, it actually causes the insertion of a pedestrian crossing phase in the signal cycle, in which all traffic lights are red and all pedestrian crossing signs indicate crossing. Even at crossings that don't have this special mode, the button serves the same purpose as the capacitive sensors under the road: it lets the signal controller know that a pedestrian is waiting. (This only matters at intersections of a major road and a minor road, where the minor road will never get a green light unless its sensor is tripped.)

You can short sell with a market order (i.e., selling into a bid offer already on the order book). "Short selling" is simply the combination of borrowing an asset (step 1) and selling it on the market (step 2). The sale step looks identical, from the market's perspective, regardless of whether the seller had borrowed the asset or owned it free and clear.
Another way to look at it: short selling increases the *supply* of an asset on the market. If *demand* remains the same, then the *price* will fall. Simple economics. So yes, shorting absolutely does cause the price to fall.
Conversely, covering a short position by buying the asset increases the *demand* for the asset. If *supply* remains the same, then the *price* will rise. So covering a short causes the price to rise.
Big banks routinely use shorting as a means to depress commodity prices, particularly in certain commodities futures markets in which the futures contracts rarely get executed for physical delivery, such as the silver market. The market price of silver would be *much* higher if not for the enormous outstanding short position in silver.

Like I said, market distortions caused by government.


Again, government mandate.
I'll grant you that nuclear reactors and coal plants are inefficient to stop and start and that it may make more sense for an operator to sell electricity at a loss for a short time if there is an expectation that demand will increase shortly and if the loss due to stopping and restarting the plant would be greater than the loss due to continuing to operate. However, wind power has essentially zero costs to stop and restart. (There might be a very small cost of wear and tear on the motors that angle the rotor blades.)
There are parallels here to Bitcoin mining. It may make sense for a mining farm to continue mining bitcoins even if the Bitcoin price temporarily dips below the point of profitability for the mining farm, as the overhead of shutting down all that equipment and then bringing it all back up again may cost more than just leaving it on.
Also, there is something to be said for laziness. If you're a fat cat sitting on a money-making machine and once in a blue moon the machine burns money instead of making it, you probably don't care enough to put in place any kind of system for responding to those rare events.

You can't do this in a decentralized way because all assets that are less volatile than Bitcoin are centralized.

I can certainly see a lot of your points. My usual line is "Anything that is both useful and scarce will be valuable." Being scarce isn't sufficient; the thing must be *useful* too. But my point is that Bitcoin is useful even if it isn't used as a currency. It's like a gold that can be shipped anywhere in the world at a negligible cost, can't be rerouted or confiscated en route, and never needs to be assayed or insured. Just those features alone make it useful, even if no merchants ever accept it in exchange for goods or services. That said, it will be *more* useful (and thus more valuable) if it *also* has the utility of being a widely accepted currency. I'm only saying that *not* being accepted as currency doesn't necessarily doom it.

You're asking a legitimate (scientifically valid) question, so you shouldn't be downvoted for it. With a system like Bitcoin that values pseudonymity, it's essentially impossible for me to have concrete evidence that there exists "a class of Bitcoin transactions that serves no useful economic purpose" except if I myself were carrying out the spam attack (which I'm not). So, instead, I'm supposing that this class of transactions exists based upon observations that these intense transaction backlogs seem to appear and disappear very suddenly, which is more characteristic of an attack than of organic usage.

I agree that we can't reasonably argue that any transaction that pays a competitive fee is "spam" in the same sense of the word as is applied to email, tweets, and blog comments.
But there is still a class of Bitcoin transactions that serves no useful economic purpose (besides inciting panic over the block-size limit). We have no way of discriminating against these transactions versus the *useful* classes of transactions, in which bitcoins move from the control of one entity into the control of another entity, but we can still rationally speak of the class of economically useless transactions that are now clogging up the blockchain. Maybe "spam" is an inappropriate term for these transactions. I've been using it for lack of a better alternative. Do you have any ideas for what we could call these transactions that serve no other purpose than to fill blocks and pump up fees?

The relative numbers of buyers and sellers in the market don't determine which direction the price moves. Rather, what determines this is the relative aggregate desperation of the buyers versus the aggregate desperation of the sellers. If neither side is desperate at all, then all market participants will put their limit orders on the book at prices that are advantageous to them, and no trades will occur, and thus the price won't move. The price only moves when one side gets desperate enough to accept the other side's offer.

No, **Bitcoin** is the cream of the crop of currencies. The USD is currently seen as a reserve currency in much of the world, but this could change very suddenly. Ancient Rome's currency was in the same favorable position for hundreds of years but eventually was hyperinflated away to nothing.
Besides, the Federal Reserve has a stated goal of creating 2% price inflation per annum. In another four years, Bitcoin's monetary inflation rate will be less than 2% and will only fall toward zero afterward. Thus, it is *mathematically guaranteed* that 1 bitcoin will eventually equal $10,000, *if* Bitcoin remains in existence. The bigger "if" isn't whether the USD will lose another 99% of its value — it definitely will — but whether Bitcoin will still be around then.

Heh, good luck. PostgreSQL bogs down past a certain number of records in an index, and the number of transactions in the blockchain now is beyond that number (for most normal-sized systems).
I wrote a program that scans Bitcoin Core's raw blockchain data files and translates the transactions into PostgreSQL's "pgcopy" format, which is PostgreSQL's native binary import/export format, and it's basically not possible to import the resulting file into a PostgreSQL table. It gets through a few hundred million rows and then starts getting so slow that it's not worth waiting for it to finish.
I had better luck importing all the transactions into a Cassandra database — at least the import actually completed, albeit after a couple of days of disk grinding.

Yes, but this is not good enough.


Exactly the problem. It can happen that my node tells me a transaction is valid (and possibly even confirmed!) when in fact it is not considered valid under the new rules that my node doesn't enforce (and which I may not even know about).


Yes, this is true. There is no way to prevent miners from being *more selective* about which transactions they consider valid than the published consensus rules require.
So, at the end of the day, you can't ever really know that your full node is enforcing the same rules as the miners, so [original assertion]( about safety is wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-13 10:38:03
A miner has to weigh the costs of mining a transaction against the revenue from doing so. The costs include not only disk lookup time and storage space but also the increased time needed to transmit the block (during which time the miner may lose a race with another miner). Therefore, there is a minimum fee rate below which a miner should not be interested in mining a transaction. This minimum rate varies with each miner's individual costs.

Moving the witness root hash into the block header would be "clean" from a first principles perspective, but it would actually be suboptimal for SPV clients, as it would constitute extra data that they'd need to download but that would have no utility to them.

What's unclean about SegWit as a soft fork? Encoding the signatures after the output scripts instead of where the `scriptSig` field has traditionally been placed? Placing the witness Merkle tree root hash in the coinbase input script rather than in the block header? These are just serialization format considerations. If we were designing Bitcoin from scratch, we might order the fields differently than soft-fork SegWit does, but a slightly jumbled field order for the sake of backward compatibility doesn't really constitute uncleanliness.

Thanks for digging that up. It's interesting and not altogether surprising. However, given this formula, there are a shocking number of elevators that are not ADA-compliant. Consider a lobby with four elevators side-by-side, with a single set of call buttons between the two center sets of doors. If the door openings are five feet wide and there are three feet between each pair of doors, then the distance between the call buttons and the centerline of one of the far sets of doors is 12 feet, and the distance between that centerline and a point 60 inches directly in front of the call buttons is 13 feet. Then, the formula requires the doors to remain open for at least 13/1.5=8⅔ seconds. That's close to an eternity when you're the only one on the elevator, waiting for the doors to close when no one wants to get on. I guess it's not completely unreasonable, as I'm sure I've experienced elevators that wait this long, but I really feel like such a long wait can be preempted with the Door Close button. Now that I know the magic formula, I will definitely be paying more attention to whether elevators abide by it.

Firstly, thank you for taking the time to type all that up. I do agree that we would need proof of publication if we were trying to replace a trusted agency with a blockchain, but I didn't think that was the goal. As much as I'd love to eject all authorities from civilized society and replace them with indisputable cryptography, it just doesn't seem like the bulk of humanity is smart enough to accept a system like that. Maybe I'm being overly pessimistic, but I really doubt that centralized record keepers will ever be replaced by a blockchain. Accepting that we'll never be rid of the leeches, then the next best thing is to keep them accountable/uncorrupted, for which we only need them to commit to a hash of their signed database. Granted, I'm not sure how we'd ever convince them to publish their database (which we'd need in order to check their hashes) since that's their bread and butter.
But, assuming for a moment that there does exist an industry that is ripe for crypto-izing, why do the documents themselves need to be embedded in a block chain? Wouldn't it suffice to store the documents in some kind of globally replicated file system (maybe something like Freenet, only better) and simply embed references in the blockchain? It just doesn't sit right with me that we'd need a million-fold redundant storage of large documents. A blockchain is really not the place for that kind of data.

Whether 1 MB is too large depends on your priorities and your vision for Bitcoin. If you see Bitcoin as "digital gold," a safe-haven asset for long-term preservation of wealth, then 1 MB blocks are too large. If you see Bitcoin as "Internet cash," a universal medium of exchange for everyday transactions worldwide, then 1 MB is not nearly large enough.
The reason there's a debate at all is that not everyone has the same use case for Bitcoin.

There are actually developers calling for just this, saying 1 MB blocks are already too large for much of the world's communications infrastructure.
Bitcoin may eventually become a "high-powered money" to be used for settlements among off-chain payment hubs. Lightning Network is one way this could materialize, but there could be others. Until these technologies get more fleshed out, though, I wouldn't advocate for the block-size limit to be reduced. Really, any hardfork to change the block-size limit is going to be a stopgap, not a real fix, which is another good reason to oppose it. Kicking the can down the road only alleviates the sense of urgency to develop real solutions, but we need to retain that sense of urgency, or the real solutions won't be developed.

You have it backwards: "blocksonly" nodes do upload blocks; they simply do not relay transactions. See the [pull request]( where this mode was implemented.
"blocksonly" nodes do help the network, though not as much as full nodes do. However, a full node with a severely throttled upload is worse for network health than a "blocksonly" node with a more typical upload speed, as the throttled node will increase propagation delays on blocks and transactions: any nodes requesting blocks and transactions from a throttled node will have to wait for the transfer to complete before they can forward those blocks and transactions further across network.

You pay a premium in proportion to the disparity in reversibility of payment methods. Bitcoin is the ultimate in irreversible payment. Credits cards are highly reversible.

I'm of exactly the same opinion as you and for the same reason, but we should recognize that Bitcoin is attempting to serve two masters: there are people like us, but there are also people who need Bitcoin because they have no reliable banking infrastructure where they live. The latter group need Bitcoin to be affordable even for transactions of a few dollars' worth of value.

Yes, but that would require sacrificing privacy or efficiency. In order to pay a greater fee without adding another input, the replacement transaction needs to reduce the amount of change it sends back to the originator, but the change output is indistinguishable from the payment output (by design), so reducing the amount of change would violate the rule that the replacement must pay all the same addresses at least the same amounts. The change output could be indicated explicitly in the original transaction, but that would be a privacy leak. Alternatively, an additional input and an additional change output could be added, but that leaks privacy too (the added output is obviously change) and it uses more blockchain space so is less efficient. Since zero-confirmation payments were **never safe** to begin with, nothing is given up by allowing a replacement transaction to have entirely different output scripts and amounts. The whole "opt-in" thing with the RBF eligibility flag was a ruse to win the support of non-technical people; it provides no actual safety.

It's even easier than other commenters have suggested. You don't need `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`, and you don't need to monkey around with writing your own Bitcoin scripts, which could be very dangerous. All you need is `nLockTime`.
Create a transaction that pays your bitcoins to a new address that you control, set the `nLockTime` on it to the Unix timestamp or block height at which you want to regain control of your bitcoins, sign the transaction, and throw away the private key that you just used to sign. In so doing, your signed transaction will become the only way to move those bitcoins, and it won't become valid until the lock time is reached.

                 keypool will be used until it has been depleted.
2. seed          (string, optional, default=random seed) The WIF private key to use as the new HD seed.

Thanks for the link. I could definitely see the crossing buttons being placebos in a dense urban area like New York City, where the traffic lights are carefully synchronized and always go through the full cycle regardless of whether cars or pedestrians are present. I will say that the buttons do have an effect in Manchester, NH, where I and other cop-blocking activists have used them to great effect to make all cars pause at an intersection for 20 seconds or so, long enough for us to warn drivers about the hidden police checkpoint. (When the button is pressed, the controller will insert an all-red state into the cycle and let all pedestrians cross in all directions, even diagonally.)
As for the elevator buttons, I guess I can't rule out the possibility that some elevators have had their controllers configured to ignore the button, but it certainly works in most, if not all, elevators I've ever been in. I push it all the time after people get out, if I can see that no one is on the landing wanting to get in, and it definitely cuts down the time that the elevator sits there waiting with its doors open.

Did you wait for your incoming channel to be announced? Some nodes wait for a while (like a day) before announcing a channel. If you tried receiving a Lightning payment immediately after opening an incoming channel and you got "no route," you should try again after your channel has aged a day.

There are legitimate reasons that increasing the block-size limit could be dangerous. Probably doubling (i.e., to 2 MB) would not be catastrophic, but every marginal increase will price more nodes out of the network. Could Bitcoin survive if the only operating full nodes belong to the mining pools? That's a question to which I do not want to find out the answer the hard way.

You did it the hard (manual) way. The easier way is to lock all UTxOs in your wallet, then run `abandontransaction` to put your original transaction's spent UTxO(s) back into your wallet, then run another `sendtoaddress` to re-spend those same UTxO(s) in a different transaction. Be sure to pay a higher fee rate on the new transaction so that it replaces the original one in the mempool. Don't forget to unlock the rest of the UTxOs in your wallet when you're finished.

This is true unless a majority of the mining power has started enforcing new rules that your node doesn't enforce, as in a soft fork. In that case, your node can be fooled into seeing and validating transactions that will never permanently be included in the block chain. I dislike soft forks for this reason; they silently break existing software, so that it no longer actually guarantees what it says it guarantees.

It wouldn't make sense to compress the hashes, keys, or signatures in the blocks, as those are indistinguishable from randomly chosen bits. Some of the fixed-width integer fields have much larger ranges than their typical values fall into, so there are some savings to be had there. Sometimes public keys or previous transaction hashes are repeated in a transaction, so it would be helpful to encode those using back references. All of these techniques could be utilized when storing the block data on disk, and they could also be used on the wire between two nodes that have negotiated to do this. This is not a consensus change, so feel free to implement it. Core already has a "compressed" transaction class that you could further develop and utilize.

Gold has fungibility problems too, though. Not all gold has the same purity, and different bars have different assayers, so not all bars can be trusted uniformly.

The principal reason it's impossible to establish a channel directly between two mobile Lightning wallets is that cell phones typically don't get assigned globally routable IP addresses, due to IPv4 address space exhaustion.

A soft fork undermines backward compatibility too, and it does so in a way that's more insidious than a hard fork. With a soft fork, you as a node operator don't even know that your node is no longer enforcing the same rules that the miners are enforcing. At least with a hard fork, you get a very stark signal that you're no longer using the same ruleset. Soft forks silently break existing software, degrading its security properties in an undetectable way.

You could do that, but it would only yield you a different set of public keys if you were to pick a curve point that isn't in the cycle of the official generator point. Given that almost half of the valid curve points are in the cycle of the official generator, you'd have almost even odds of picking a new generator that is in the cycle of the official generator, in which case you wouldn't get access to a distinct set of public keys anyway. Your best bet would be to take the additive inverse of the generator point as your new generator point. Then you'd get access to the "other half" of the points on the curve as your set of potential public keys. But why would you do this anyway? It would just break intercompatibility for no gain in security.

This creates a tragedy of the commons (a.k.a., a collective action problem). Each miner's individual incentives will be to include every transaction that pays fees in excess of the miner's costs to include the transaction. (To do otherwise would be to leave money on the table for competing miners to snarf up.) However, by doing this continuously, the system evolves to a steady state in which *all* transactions pay infinitesimally more in fees than the actual cost to mine them, so regardless of how many transactions miners are including into their blocks, they're making effectively no profit from transaction fees.

Embedding multiple conflicting documents into the blockchain is possible, is it not? (I'm assuming we won't be enacting new consensus rules to preclude conflicting land title transfers, for instance.) Todd says, "Multiple competing transfers are made obvious, and the true valid transfer can be determined by whichever transfer happened first." So the necessary bit of information to disambiguate conflicting claims is "whichever happened first." This only requires prevention of back-dating, so it only requires proof of existence.
It is true that embedding all claims directly into the blockchain, tagged by some distinct topic identifier, would allow interested parties to exhaustively find all claims of interest without needing to trust the completeness of an external index. I could see how that could be useful for title searches, though I do also see that a title searching agency has every incentive to maintain a complete index of title transfers, so really only the hashes of the transfers need be embedded in a blockchain, as a means of objectively resolving any disputed claims. Actually, the scheme would work even with just a hash of the title agency's complete database embedded into the blockchain periodically. This suffices to prevent the agency from falsifying records, which is the problem we're really trying to solve here. (The hash needs to cover a signature by the agency as well as the agency's title database itself, to prevent other parties from framing the agency.)

Now that's an interesting idea. In theory, that could, over time, bring the SHA256 mining difficulty down to a trivially easy level while introducing a new hashing algorithm alongside that would be where "real" difficulty manifests. Requiring that block timestamps be at least 10 minutes apart (but retaining the rule that they be no more than 2 hours into the future) is a soft-forkable rule change that would gradually bring SHA256 difficulty down. Or we could accomplish it even more easily by targeting some longer block interval (say, 15 minutes) for the new difficulty. It would unfortunately have the effect of making blockchain space even more scarce.

If your transaction is not in the blockchain, then, as far as Bitcoin software is concerned, it never happened. The coins are still yours. You can try again (maybe with a higher fee), though you may need to tell your wallet to abandon the old transaction first, so you can re-spend its inputs. (If you're using Bitcoin Core, then the relevant command is `abandontransaction`.)
    abandontransaction "txid"
    
    Mark in-wallet transaction &lt;txid&gt; as abandoned
    This will mark this transaction and all its in-wallet descendants as abandoned which will allow
    for their inputs to be respent.  It can be used to replace "stuck" or evicted transactions.
    It only works on transactions which are not included in a block and are not currently in the mempool.

In order for a channel to be usable for routing, the sending node needs to know about it. Lightning nodes gossip to each other (peer to peer) about the set of extant channels, but they won't gossip about a channel that is too new. The exact age at which a channel becomes eligible for announcing to other nodes varies by implementation, but it's typically longer than the number of blocks needed to "lock in" the channel (making it "active").


It's not an intentionally hidden state, although the UI of your node/wallet might not expose it in the interest of not overwhelming casual users with technical details.


That should have been enough time. Did you check 1ML.com to see if your incoming channel was visible on the network?


You can't receive at all if you only have outbound capacity. But it sounds like you did get some inbound capacity from LNBIG. Be aware that, in my experience, inbound capacity from LNBIG isn't available to be used immediately. I'm not sure if it's intentional or a bug in their implementation, but my node misunderstands the fee rates on LNBIG's channel to me initially, and this breaks incoming payments through that channel. It seems to resolve on its own after 2-3 days.


Closing channels isn't standard operating procedure; it's pretty rare. But if it does happen, you can open another one.

In general, you're free to refuse to trade with someone for any non-discriminatory reason, which can include the form of payment they're offering.

You're correct. Even if one expects fees to be roughly the same later (at the time when one expects to need to spend the UTxO), it could still be advantageous to pay for a whole transaction today at a low fee rate if one expects to have a higher time preference when spending the UTxO later.

Don't be ridiculous. A channel's counterparty doesn't "demand reparations" when I request to mutually *close* a channel, and that's the most severe reduction in capacity possible for that channel.
Anyway, my interest isn't really in splicing *out* but in splicing *in*. C-Lightning, with its maximum of one open channel per peer, seems designed around the idea of splicing, although splicing isn't yet implemented. I have many channels that I'd like to beef up with extra capacity, but I don't want to pay to close them for the purpose of opening larger ones, so I don't.

Your ISP doesn't care about how much data is transferred at the TCP layer. They only care about how much data is transmitted at the IP layer. Dropped packets cause TCP to retransmit. Those retransmissions count toward your overall upload bandwidth. For example, you'd have to transmit 1.1 MB of TCP payloads to transfer 1.0 MB of data if you're seeing 10% packet loss.
Also consider the case where the intended recipient suddenly disconnects. The last several hundred packets you had in flight to that recipient will never be delivered, yet they counted toward your upload bandwidth.

I do appreciate that Moon takes Lightning (I sure wish Purse would) and that your orders are made in your own account, which simplifies cancellations and returns.

This only works if you have a current backup of the channel you want to close.

The time to worry about hyperinflation is during the recovery *after* the recession. That's when all the money that the central bank printed during the recession needs to be sopped back up or else it will cause rampant price inflation.

Ding ding ding!! You've hit the nail squarely on the head. I've been saying this for as long as the block-size debate has been raging. Blockchain's fundamental problem is its network topology.

Three big points immediately come to mind.
* LND sends out "sync error" messages like candy on Halloween. It's so bad that C-Lightning actually had to add a special case to ignore errors bearing that exact message string to avoid unilaterally closing so many channels for no good reason. The spec stipulates that all errors are fatal errors that require the recipient to fail the channel.
* LND has had a history of sending other messages on a connection prior to a channel reestablishment message. This violates the spec, which stipulates that the channel reestablishment message must be sent before any other messages on the connection. C-Lightning had to add a special case to handle this misbehavior by LND too.
* LND sends "fee insufficient" errors when an HTLC request arrives wanting to utilize an outgoing channel that has zero fees set on it. I had five incoming channels from LNBIG, all with zero fees (zero base fee and zero proportional fee), and I couldn't receive through any of them because LNBIG was rejecting all incoming HTLC requests destined for those channels with "fee insufficient" errors. LNBIG eventually reset the fees to 0 base + 1 part per million, and immediately I was able to balance all of those channels just fine.

I love your comment, but I think you missed one point.


This isn't strictly true, as each additional transaction that a miner includes in his block increases the risk that a competing miner will find a competing block before the first miner's block propagates. So the marginal cost of adding a transaction to a block is not only the cost of the energy required to validate, store, and forward the transaction but also the increased risk of losing a block propagation race due to the increased size of the block. That said, theoretically miners could quantify such risk and set a floor on fees they will accept. The question is whether unlimited-size blocks, containing only these economically minimal-fee-paying transactions, would result in more revenue for miners than the current system of limiting the block size.

How? Isn't your thesis in this thread that it is **not** possible?
For what it's worth, C-Lightning through its plugin interface allows you to synchronously record every database change however you like, which could include firing off every change to a remote backup facility. It's synchronous, meaning C-Lightning will not continue with the network protocol until your plugin finishes. Given that, you'd always have a backup of each and every HTLC on stable storage, both locally and remotely, before your node acknowledges reception of it. Does that address your concern?

Usually your brokerage will send a 1099-B to both you and the IRS in January (or February if they're slow), and it will list every sale you made through them in the previous calendar year and the proceeds of each in USD. If the brokerage knows your cost bases, then they will report those on the 1099-B as well, in which case your capital gains will be calculated and reported alongside. Otherwise, it's up to you to calculate your net capital gains (proceeds minus cost basis) and report them. Be sure you have documentation to support any cost bases you're claiming. If you don't have documentation, then you'll have to calculate as though your cost basis was zero, meaning your entire sale proceeds are treated as capital gain and taxed as such.

You're wrong. The only way to "cancel" a Bitcoin transaction is to spend one of the same UTxOs in a different transaction and get that second transaction confirmed by a miner. Most miners won't do this if the first transaction didn't "opt in" to RBF (replace by fee), as OP's transaction didn't.

It's a fundamental property of elliptic curves. Adding two points on an elliptic curve always yields a point that is also on the curve. So if you add the generator point to itself any number of times, you'll always end up with a point that is on the curve. The generator point is chosen carefully so that it takes a very large number of self-additions to loop back around to the start. This number for the generator point of curve secp256k1 is slightly less than 2^(256).

To be fair, I use C-Lightning, which doesn't implement static channel backups, so I don't entirely know how they're implemented. In general, though, any time an HTLC is added or removed from a channel, the previous channel state is revoked and a new channel state is established. You don't want to broadcast a revoked channel state, lest you lose all your money in the channel.
I think actually maybe static channel backups work on the principle of asking your peers to unilaterally close your channels and just trusting that they'll close them with the most current state. It's not a great bet, but at least you might not lose *everything* since many peers will indeed act honestly.


The Lightning ecosystem is plastered in warnings that say, "You can lose money if you try this!" The developers weren't really ready for people to start using it on mainnet. But early adopters are risk-takers who live dangerously.

That's a dangerous game to play. If you undercut a Lightning channel funding transaction on fees too aggressively, then the channel may take so long to confirm that the peer may forget about it. Then when it finally does confirm, the channel will be in an unusable, zombie state, from which it must be closed unilaterally, and the fees for that can be arbitrarily high. (I've paid multiple dollars to unilaterally close a channel.)

Every time I've advocated for multiple clean-room implementations of Bitcoin (as a form of insurance against fatal vulnerabilities in any subset of implementations), some Core dev scolds me and asserts that consensus software depends on there being only one implementation. This is the argument that Bitcoin Core's bugs (even the unknown ones) are part of Bitcoin's consensus rules, and since they are unknown, they cannot be replicated in other implementations. It's also why every time I ask for an IETF-style specification of Bitcoin's consensus rules, I am met by glib responses that "the code is the specification." Sorry, that doesn't fly.

Isn't that essentially what `option_data_loss_protect` allows you to do? The only difference is that you don't have the option to refuse the closure that the peer initiates, but what good would that option do you anyway? If you don't know the latest channel state for certain, then you basically have to accept whatever the peer offers. The peer won't close with a state that's older than the one you mentioned in your `channel_reestablish` message since then the peer would be running a heightened risk that you know the revocation key for that older state. The peer *probably* won't close with any state that's older than the *current* state because you could have been lying in your `channel_reestablish` message about the most recent state you know in an attempt to goad the peer into closing with a state whose revocation key you actually know. In most cases the game theory says that closing with the most recent state has the best expected outcome. In other words, playing honestly is the most selfish way to play. That's why Lightning's "justice" system works.

If you're capping your upload to 15 KB/s, then you're actually harming the network, as any node that chooses to download a block from you will then have to wait around for your slow-ass node to trickle the block over, and during that time, the node will not download the block from any other nodes and also will not count the block as a confirmation of wallet transactions. In other words, you're slowing down the aggregate propagation of blocks on the network.
A key point to consider is that Bitcoin's traffic pattern is bursty. Ideally, you need to muster huge bandwidth when receiving and distributing a block, and then the time between blocks can have a much lower bandwidth.

If you're using Bitcoin Core, there are actually three timestamps on every transaction in your wallet: `"time"`, `"timereceived"`, and `"blocktime"`. I don't know how `"time"` and `"timereceived"` differ, as they seem to be the same for all recent transactions in my wallet, but the `"blocktime"` will be later than the other two for any transaction that your wallet knew about before the transaction got mined into a block. In the case of your backup wallet, maybe `"time"` will be equal to `"blocktime"`, and `"timereceived"` will be the time that you synced the block.


* You made two backups of your wallet at different times and then restored the earlier one and continued using it to the present. The later backup is the one you just found, and it contains some keys that were not in the earlier backup (and thus also not in your current wallet).
* Your wallet suffered some corruption, perhaps due to a crash or improper shutdown, between when the backup was made and now.

In order for Bitcoin to gain *value*, regardless of what happens with its price, it needs to have more utility. The utility of a currency is proportional to its acceptability for trade. Thus, we really do need more people to want bitcoins in order for their value to increase. (Or we need fewer accessible bitcoins.) A mere increase in the price of bitcoins due to fiat inflation doesn't imply an increase in value.

1 Msat is the capacity of the channel they automatically open to you. Since the wallet currently offers no way to accept other channels and since the Breez hub currently has no way of splicing more capacity into your channel, 1 Msat (minus a few ksat) is the maximum balance you can hold in your Breez wallet. To empty it out, you can either send Lightning payments to another Lightning wallet or use the "Remove Funds" function, which does a submarine swap to an on-chain address.

Amen. Some supplemental material, excerpted without permission from a speech by Neal Boortz:
«You have been taught that the real value of any group of people – be it a social group, an employee group, a management group, whatever – is based on diversity.  This is a favored liberal ideal because diversity is based not on an individual's abilities or character, but on a person's identity and status as a member of a group.  Yes – it's that liberal group identity thing again.  Within the great diversity movement, group identification – be it racial, gender based, or some other minority status – means more than the individual's integrity, character, or other qualifications.»

Any time you do valuable labor, you are creating value "out of thin air." In fact, even more generally, *every* voluntary exchange — whether it's labor for money, goods for money, goods for labor, goods for goods, etc. — creates value "out of thin air." Both parties believe they are better off — they possess more "value" — after the exchange than before it. If this were not true, then one or both of the parties would not agree to the exchange.
A key point, though, is that *all value is subjective*. One man's trash is another man's treasure. When two people make a voluntary trade, each ends up with something that he/she values more than what he/she traded away. So "value" is created: the subjective value that each party ascribes to what he/she obtained.

If you've bought and are holding a futures contract, such that you will have to take delivery of the underlying commodity on the delivery date, then you have a long position on the underlying commodity.
If you've written and have sold a futures contract, such that you will have to deliver the underlying commodity on the delivery date, then you have a short position on the underlying commodity.
Here are some possible reasons someone might use futures in BTC:
* You want to buy some BTC. You believe the price will be higher next month, so you'd like to buy today, but you don't have the cash available to buy right now. Instead, you can buy a futures contract whose price is below what you believe BTC's market price will be on the contract's delivery date. Crucially, you can buy the contract with leverage, enabling you to spend less on it today than if you had bought the BTC on the spot market. If the market price of BTC moves against you, you may have to deposit more fiat to cover your leverage.
* You're a miner with fixed costs (rent and electricity mainly). You calculate that you need the BTC price to be $7000/BTC at the end of the month, when you sell your mined coins, for you to break even. You're worried that the market price may fall below that threshold by the end of the month. If you sell a futures contract at the beginning of the month at a price of $7500/BTC, then you're guaranteed a profit of $500/BTC, even if the market price has fallen well below $7500/BTC by the time you deliver your mined bitcoins. The trade-off is that you won't see any additional profit if the price actually rises above $7500/BTC by the end of the month. So, selling a futures contract is a way for you to guarantee a fixed revenue, regardless of what happens to the underlying commodity's price.

It is absolutely possible that a compromised wallet could produce a signed Bitcoin transaction that would pass all script checks by Bitcoin nodes yet would still contain sufficient information to enable the attacker to obtain the user's private key. Such an attack might not be obvious. For example, an ECDSA signature could use, instead of a *random* 256-bit integer, the user's private key XOR'd with a 256-bit integer known to the attacker. The signature would appear totally normal to everyone, but it would reveal the private key to the attacker.

You're assuming that all transactions would be eligible to be placed in the extra rooms. This would be a bad implementation mistake, and the devs are smart enough not to make this mistake.
Transactions created by old software would only be eligible to be placed in the main space. Only newer software would create transactions that would be eligible for placement in the extra space.


There could be a risk that payments sent by users of new software to users of old software would not be seen by the users of old software. However, again, this could be avoided. Bitcoin addresses generated by new software could have a different version number. Combining this with the above would ensure that only transactions sent from new software to new software could be placed in the extra space.
This does, unfortunately, come with the stipulation that coins could never again be sent to an old address once tainted by a transaction that had been placed in the extra space.

I think you misunderstood my point. In order for Lightning Network to operate efficiently (i.e., to not require new channels to be opened in order to complete payments), a significant quantity of bitcoins must be locked up in channels. These bitcoins cannot be used for any other purpose (e.g., investment, loans) while they're held in a channel. One could imagine that large LN hubs could need to commit tens of thousands of bitcoins to open channels. These bitcoins would be serving an economically inefficient function, relative to the other functions they could be fulfilling. In other words, it won't make good investment sense for LN hubs to lock up bitcoins in payment channels when they could get a much better rate of return by investing their bitcoins in productive ventures.

**Pre-Bitcoin:** You're storing your wealth in gold. You need to pay some bills. You can't easily or cheaply ship the exact mass of gold you need to pay your bills, so you sell some quantity of gold for fiat currency, which is trivial to subdivide and transmit.
**Post-Bitcoin:** You're storing your wealth in bitcoins. You need to pay some bills. You send the requisite amount of bitcoins (not necessarily on-chain).

They are the default LSP for their Breez Mobile wallet, but their intention is to allow their wallet to be configured to use other LSPs and for users with Lightning nodes at home to be able to act as their own LSPs. So Breez Mobile will still be a captive wallet, but it won't be dependent on Breez's service.
As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, BlueWallet can already make use of an lndhub other than the one run by the developer. I'm not thrilled by BlueWallet's approach, though.


"Remote control" seems okay. Or maybe "remote front end." I like that approach too. Spark seems like an acceptable remote front end to C-Lightning, my node of choice.

Oh please. Quit trolling. Widespread adoption of Bitcoin isn't going to take the form of everyone buying their Frappuccinos on the blockchain. The blockchain exists to settle disputes; that's literally the reason it was invented; computers needed an ungameable way of knowing, among a set of conflicting transactions, which is the one to be accepted. Since almost no Bitcoin payments are contentious, almost no Bitcoin payments actually need to touch the blockchain. They can, should, and will use off-chain methods. The Lightning Network is a very good contender.

That's one of those "lies we tell children." It's not how the system actually works. Banks conjure brand new money into existence by making loans. They literally just add an amount to the borrower's account balance on the computer. New money springs into existence. Depositor accounts represent liabilities of a bank. To keep their books balanced, when the bank increases their liabilities by adding an amount to the borrower's account, the bank must also add the same amount to the bank's assets. What allows them to do this legally is that they have a signed promissory note from the borrower that is "worth" the amount of the loan, and that note becomes an "asset" of the bank. Banks are allowed to perform this money creating act almost without limit, but they *are* limited by the reserve ratio. That's the only reason they pay interest on deposits at all: they want to attract deposits so that they will be allowed to lend more money into existence. The banks that are paying crap interest rates on deposits aren't near their limits on creating money, so they don't care to attract any more deposits at this time.

Pfff. "Lock up bitcoins." That's a misconception. Bitcoins in channels are no more "locked up" than bitcoins in any other UTxO.

It is possible to create a soft fork where new blocks *do* contain transactions that old nodes won't see at all. I believe that this is what happens in extension blocks; the new part of the block, including all of the transactions it contains, is not visible to old nodes, and thus the old nodes do not process the transactions in the new part of the block in any way. SegWit intentionally avoided this scenario by not placing the transactions themselves outside of the part of the block that old nodes could see, but the trade-off is that we can't get blocks bigger than about 2 MB this way. To go bigger, we will have to start making some transactions entirely invisible to older nodes.

Huh? If you can't find a route to pay the gas station (perhaps because the station has no more incoming capacity), then *you open a channel* to them. Costs you no more than paying them on chain, but you can open your channel for more than the cost of your one tank of gas, and then next time you go there you'll be able to pay them using your existing channel, meaning zero fees.
But that's a contrived scenario in the first place. A gas station isn't just going to sit on a pile of bitcoins; they have expenses. If their suppliers and employees won't take bitcoin, then they'll have to sell their bitcoins for fiat, meaning they'll have to send their bitcoins to exchanges, meaning they'll have incoming capacity again.

Some asteroids, particularly "M-type" asteroids, actually contain much higher concentrations of precious metals than the Earth's crust, in some cases so much higher that building and launching probes there to mine it and return it would be wildly profitable. NASA estimates that just one near-Earth asteroid, 16 Psyche, contains roughly 10 quintillion dollars' worth of precious metals at the current market prices. Of course, it wouldn't be possible to sell it all for that much money, as the sudden huge influx of supply would crater the markets, but that's my point.

I don't see how. Each Lightning participant only needs to download/store the Bitcoin blockchain, the current channel graph, and the history (revocation keys) for only the channels directly pertaining to the participant. Each statechain participant would need to download/store the Bitcoin blockchain and an ever-growing additional chain that contains data not directly pertinent to the participant. So that is still linear growth of bandwidth/storage in proportion to the number of payments made in the entire network. Contrast to Lightning, which has linear growth in proportion to the number of payments made by the individual user.

So what if I bought some coins on MtGox during the heyday and then sold them on Coinbase a couple years later? There are no records of my trades on MtGox, so I can't prove my cost basis. Does this mean the IRS will just assume my cost basis was zero?
Even if I had kept records of all my MtGox trades (thousands of them — I ran a bot), how could I prove my cost basis to the IRS? It's not like MtGox ever issued me any 1099's. I could submit my own records (if I had them), but what would stop me from fabricating those records? It's not like the IRS could verify them; MtGox is long gone.

Yes, but then users would need to have inbound TCP connectivity. Because of IPv4 address space exhaustion, almost every node is behind NAT, and a lot of people don't know how to forward ports (or can't be bothered to).
I'm with you, though, in general. If a Lightning payment request/invoice can't be paid due to a lack of routes with sufficient capacity, then the payer *should* simply open a new channel directly to the payee and push the payment over that new channel. That's how the Lightning Network is going to grow organically.

JoinMarket is open-source software, written in Python, that you run on your own computer. Your bitcoins never leave your exclusive control because the JoinMarket software only ever signs transactions that pay your bitcoins from one address that you control to another address that you control. The trick is that those transactions also include several other people's inputs and outputs doing the same thing, making your outputs indistinguishable from theirs. Do that a few times, and it becomes impossible for an onlooker to follow the chain of custody of your coins with any useful degree of certainty.
I've been running JoinMarket for about a week now, and I wish I had discovered it sooner.

A channel's *state* cannot be changed unilaterally. Both parties must sign any new state in order for it to be valid. The danger in having a node offline for too long is that a counterparty could broadcast an *outdated* state, one that pays out more to the counterparty than the most recent state does. If your node is online, it will notice such an attempt to cheat and will automatically take *all* funds in the channel, including funds that had been payable to the counterparty in the most recent channel state. That total forfeiture is the punishment that Lightning implements to discourage cheating, but the punishment can only be applied if the cheated node is online to notice and punish the cheating node.

Blocks could contain, on average, around 3000 transactions (on the high end). Let's assume blocks are bringing in around 12.7 BTC (subsidy + fees) on average today. At $8000/BTC, that means the mining reward per block is about $101,600. To maintain that same reward level when the subsidy is exhausted, the average transaction fee would need to be about $34.
Granted, it's likely that Bitcoin would have hard-forked to raise the block weight limit well before then, as even smartwatches would come standard with multiple terabytes of holographic storage and have gigabit ultra-wideband connections to the Internet.

Yes and no. Ubiquitous use of autopilot will help to some extent, but graph theory and game theory dictate that there will always be some nodes with far more incoming capacity than outgoing capacity, implying that other nodes will necessarily have the opposite imbalance. The reason for this is that it will never be the case that all channels are opened at random; there will always be some proportion of channels that are opened manually with intent, and those channels will tend to favor adding incoming capacity to the large hubs. This implies that other nodes, those that are not large hubs, will tend to have less incoming capacity than outgoing capacity on average.
One technical challenge I see standing in the way of solving the incoming capacity problem is that many pairs of nodes are incapable of directly connecting to one another. For example, if I have Eclair Mobile on my phone and you have Bitcoin Lightning Wallet on your phone, we will be unable to establish a channel between ourselves. So if I want to send you some funds via Lightning and you don't have enough incoming capacity, then I can't simply open a new channel to you. In theory, IPv6 should solve this problem, but widespread deployment of IPv6 is taking forever.
@_date: 2019-10-16 00:03:36
As I'm sure you're aware, there's no need for port forwarding with IPv6 either. And no need to run a daemon or set up any awkward proxy configurations in various apps.

At the end of the day, the blockchain is there to settle disputes. That's literally the reason it was invented — to arbitrate between conflicting transactions. Very close to all of transactions worldwide proceed without dispute. If the world can settle 7 disputed transactions per second, that should be plenty. All the rest — the overwhelmingly vast majority — don't need to touch the blockchain. Bitcoin started out in an extreme, degenerate mode in which every payment hits the blockchain, whether it's contentious or not. That's a misappropriation of a limited resource.

Depends on how thin your razor is. Miners won't mine if they can invest the same capital in some other enterprise and earn a better rate of return for the same level of risk.

The fact that miners can continue to mine blocks that violate the new rules (but satisfy the old rules) is exactly why soft-fork upgrades in the past (such as SegWit) have required large-scale signaling of readiness from miners before the new rules would activate.

Think again. They do this all the time with silver. "Naked shorting" is the technical term. It's when you sell short more of an asset than you own or could reasonably acquire. I haven't looked lately, but at times the total short position against silver has been greater than the global annual production of silver. This leads to what is called the "paper silver" market, where investors think they're buying silver but are really just buying promises to deliver silver can't physically be met. It'll be a little harder for Bitcoin to get into this situation since taking physical delivery of bitcoins is so much easier than taking physical delivery of silver, but there is still a heavy danger of a "paper bitcoin" market developing and artificially suppressing the price of bitcoins through large naked short positions.

If there's a 1-in-1,000,000 chance that the world will end this year, then you should allocate your wagers in proportion to that chance: for instance, invest $0.01 into the "world will end" scenario for each $9,999.99 that you invest into "world will not end" scenarios. Point is, if the world *does* end, you do in fact want an iron in that fire. You should only not invest in the "world will end" scenario at all if there is exactly no chance of that scenario playing out.

I'm frankly *glad* it takes a long time to make even minor changes to Bitcoin. The longer a change takes to implement, the more opportunities there are for people to raise concerns and flush out flaws before it's too late. Look at what happened with "SegWit2X": it was a relatively minor change that was rushed into production and actually would have crashed and burned at launch due to not having had enough eyes on it.

Coinfloor have been publishing anonymized customer account balances for years, as part of their monthly provable solvency reports.

JoinMarket is cheap and supports CoinJoins of any amount. Wasabi wallet has higher fees and only supports a few discrete denominations of CoinJoins but offers more participants per join.

What country are you in? That's not how it works in the U.S., unfortunately. Here, regardless of whether the seller and buyer want to conduct their trade in bitcoins, they are still forced to use whatever currency the title company accepts. The buyer always pays the title company, and then the title company pays the seller. No title company that I know of will conduct a real estate transaction in bitcoins.
**Edit:** Wow, evidently lot of redditors have never purchased real estate. [What Does A Title Company Do?]( I have looked into buying property with bitcoins. I even found a seller who was willing to take bitcoins. But it's not possible, as the money doesn't go directly from the buyer to the seller.

Sure, but if the cloud miners had a solid business model, then they could have taken traditional loans to purchase their equipment and kept all the operating profits for themselves (to pay back the loans). It's because they *weren't able to get traditional loans* (because their business model was fishy) that they resorted to selling mining contracts. That's scammy because they advertised such contracts as being profitable, yet if mining were as likely to be profitable as they portrayed, then they could have simply gotten loans.

Yes and no. Under the new rules, blocks are not *required* to contain any witness data or witness commitments, so older software *can* build blocks that will be accepted by SegWit-compliant software. However, older mining software would not be able to enforce the redemption criteria on SegWit outputs, so any transaction spending a SegWit output could not be included by such a miner. The trouble for the miner is that it has no logic to discriminate spends of SegWit outputs from spends of legacy outputs, so there is an overwhelming probability that it will try to include a transaction that spends a SegWit output without including the required witness data for that transaction. The resulting block would be rejected by all SegWit-compliant nodes, meaning the miner would have wasted a ton of energy.

If you used a good wallet, you could have bumped your fee higher if your transaction was taking too long for your liking.
One of the challenges with the Bitcoin ecosystem is that it's a free-for-all: not all software that supports Bitcoin offers all the tools you really need to have a good experience with Bitcoin. The negative side of permissionless innovation is that the only form of quality control is the court of public opinion.


Well, it's ridiculous that you would want to record your coffee purchase in an indelible global ledger for the rest of eternity. That's a gross misappropriation of a scarce resource. "Coffee transactions" don't need that level of permanence and visibility; the Lightning Network exists to support all the little incidental transactions like your coffee purchase, and the fees can be in the sub-satoshi range. I recently deposited 10,000 satoshis to LNTipBot on Reddit, and I paid 0.03 satoshis as the fee. So yeah, only use the blockchain for big, slow transactions, as that's what it's made for.

Nope. A hard fork is where old nodes won't accept blocks created by new nodes. A soft fork is where old nodes do accept blocks created by new nodes. There is no requirement that the old nodes must be able to understand everything in the new blocks, and in particular, the new nodes might not share all of the information in the new blocks to the old nodes. That's what happened with SegWit; old nodes don't see the witness data.

If you define a satoshi as the smallest indivisible unit of Bitcoin, then we would simply redefine 1 bitcoin as 10^9 satoshis instead of 10^(8), and all transaction outputs made before the block in which the redefinition occurs would thereafter be treated as having 10x as many satoshis. So the final supply of bitcoins would still be 21×10^6 bitcoins, but this would be equal to 21×10^15 satoshis rather than 21×10^14 as it is currently. The decimal point can be moved as many places as necessary so that satoshis have low enough value to be useful in commerce.

I wouldn't switch to a client that removes the halving, and I suspect a significant fraction of other Bitcoin users wouldn't either. So if some miners were to fork the software to eliminate the halving, they'd be mining on a new fork that won't have many users, and thus their fork won't be very valuable, and thus they'd likely go out of business.

I could have written something very similar to this, as it is exactly how I feel. The only significant difference is that I had already broken up with fiat before Bitcoin came along. I was a "silver bug," but Bitcoin is just miles ahead of precious metals. I will never go back to fiat. That system is inherently broken, and, worse, its perpetrators *knew* of its inherent brokenness when they foisted it on us. It's an outright scam to drain wealth out of society and funnel it into the banksters' pockets, and Bitcoin is our best shot at taking it down. This is why I'm so frustrated and saddened by all these alts and forks, which are setting Bitcoin back by years in its quest to save civilization, by confusing non-technical people and undermining Bitcoin's premise of sound money.

Yes, that absolutely can happen. The way you protect against that is that you must invalidate your transaction by spending at least one of its inputs in a different transaction.

Blockchain space will become extremely precious, such that almost all on-chain transactions will be from channel factories performing aggregate channel operations, as only they will have the economies of scale to afford the very expensive blockchain space. For example, 300 bytes of blockchain space might cost the bitcoin equivalent of $100 of today's money. That'll be perfectly fine for a channel factory that is rolling up 10,000 channel operations, each of which would thus cost the equivalent of $0.01, but individual users of Bitcoin will practically never put a transaction directly on chain, as the fee would be uneconomical for almost any transaction.

"Native" SegWit is the newer address format, starting with "bc1", whereas the transitional SegWit address format starts with "3". Using native SegWit shaves a little more weight out of transactions, equating to lower fees for those who have made the switch.
Replace-By-Fee is an opt-in feature that allows you to replace an unconfirmed transaction in the mempool with a different one that pays a higher fee. It's very useful if you want to minimize the amount you pay in fees but still retain the ability to increase the fee on your transaction if you get tired of waiting for it to confirm.

This is almost meaningless, as it doesn't control for the *sizes* of these generations. Like, if there were twice as many 30-year-old boomers as there are 30-year-old millennials, then obviously boomers would have had a greater fraction of U.S. household wealth. That's not really saying anything.

Banks can lend infinitely much. The only limit on how much they can lend is how much market demand there is for borrowing.

If you're trying to say that the IRS cares which specific UTxO you sell, then you'd be forced to conclude that 100% of your sale is short-term.

SegWit isn't a scaling solution and was never intended to be. It was a fix for transaction malleability and a path for future Script upgrades, and it came with a one-time capacity increase as an afterthought.

You could keep the blockchain data files (`blocks` directory) on the HDD but put the UTxO database (`chainstate` directory) on the SSD.
What's so slow about syncing a Bitcoin node is looking up all the UTxOs redeemed in each transaction in each block. Those lookups don't need the blockchain data; they only access the UTxO database. That's a large number of disk seeks, so if you move your UTxO database to your SSD, you can vastly improve performance. The blockchain data files are just used for serving the blockchain to other nodes and rebuilding your UTxO database if you ever need to.
Take care, though: LevelDB (the database system that the UTxO database runs on) is optimized for spinning disks and will cause a large volume of writes to your SSD. It's a matter of debate just how much you need to worry about write wear on your SSD. I have actually worn out SSDs with write-heavy enterprise workloads, so it *can* happen.

One of the strong advantages in Sipa's proposal is that it does not introduce a step-wise discontinuity. It has already been shown that an 8 MB block size today would break Electrum Server (in that it would irrecoverably fall behind). Sipa's proposal gives us a smooth increase that allows any increasing technological pressures to be felt gradually, so we have enough time to respond to them.

Good on you for getting your bitcoins into a safer storage. Indeed, in order to trade them on an exchange you would need to pay another transaction fee to move them again.

There's no fiat money "in" Bitcoin. Whenever you buy bitcoins with fiat, your fiat just goes to whoever sold the bitcoins you bought; it doesn't go "into" Bitcoin. It's entirely possible for the price of an asset to go to zero while there are still people holding it. The only requirement is that *no one* wants to buy it at any price. That could conceivably happen even to Bitcoin.

I think it's more that the attack just became worthwhile to achieve their objective. But how full the blocks are with "ham" transactions is irrelevant to whether they can fill them up with spam.


Miners are not homogeneous. Larger miners will use their unbounded freedom to create unbearable costs for smaller miners, forcing them out of business and most non-mining full nodes along with them.


That describes what the software does. I'm talking about cryptography. A signature has no time limit. If a miner wants to reap all of the spam fees, he can do it. He doesn't have to throw away transactions ever.

Right, and therein lies the problem for the banksters. A dollar is indistinguishable from a promise to pay a dollar in the future because *all* dollars are promises to pay; they are I.O.U.'s. By contrast, a bitcoin is trivially distinguished from a promise to a pay a bitcoin in the future.

Yes, this is asserting that the signature follows the ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), which mandate (among other things) that SEQUENCE values use the definite-length form and that INTEGER values are encoded using the fewest possible number of bytes.
Evidently OpenSSL's signature parser really only requires that a signature follow ASN.1's Basic Encoding Rules (BER), which allow quite a bit of flexibility (and inefficiency) in how values are encoded.

The Federal Reserve "prints" as much fiat currency as is necessary to suppress prevailing interest rates to the Fed's targets. If the government issues a ton of bonds to pay for its profligacy, then the interest rates on those bonds would start to rise as investors begin to doubt the government's ability to repay its debt, but the Fed will automatically fire up the printing presses to push the interest rates back down. So, effectively, the Fed monetizes the government's debt indirectly via a feedback loop.

Oh, I forgot about SegWit's fix for quadratic-complexity signature validation. That *is* a way in which SegWit does actually improve Bitcoin's scalability, although it's quite an edge case, as the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin transactions don't exhibit any problems despite the quadratic time complexity.
The UTxO cost rebalancing you're mentioning doesn't change Bitcoin's scalability, which is still O(N^(2)): the number of transactions is proportional to the number of nodes, and each transaction must be transmitted to every node, so the number of transaction transmissions scales with the *square* of the number of nodes, which is Very Bad.

What makes you think raising the block-size limit would unclog the mempool? The spammer is presently paying a lot more than the minimum fees.

I don't know. I can't see the future. But I know that Lightning is not the only conceivable scaling solution.
One solution that I was hoping to see (until Lightning came onto the scene) was blockchain sharding, wherein each node could choose how large or small a fraction of the blockchain it wanted to validate, and all nodes working in concert would achieve a probabilistic integrity check on the blockchain. (Nodes could still choose to validate 100%, which would be equivalent to full nodes today.) There are two challenges to implementing this solution. One is that it must be possible for a node to look up and retrieve a particular transaction from any node that should hold a record of that transaction, in order to validate inputs to transactions, since nodes likely would not be holding records of the previous transactions that were spent as inputs in the new transactions that the nodes are validating. This probably would require a distributed hash table (DHT). The other challenge is that nodes must be able to prove that a given transaction output still exists in the UTxO set as of any specified block. This probably would require UTxO set commitments in coinbases, which would require a soft fork to enforce. The technology exists to solve both of these problems, so we might some day see blockchain sharding implemented.

Well, yes, but it won't work in Bitcoin like it works in silver. The reason naked shorting is effective at suppressing the prices of physical commodities is that taking delivery of physical commodities is expensive, so nearly all futures traders just roll forward their contracts to avoid having to take delivery. In contrast, taking delivery of bitcoins has no marginal cost, so there is no incentive to roll forward versus taking delivery.

The receiving wallet doesn't know that any miners received the transaction in question. Miners may have received a different transaction that spends the same inputs. If you trust the sender, then you can accept 0-conf transactions, but if the sender has an incentive to defraud you, then you should require more proof of payment than a 0-conf transaction.

Set up fair traffic queuing on your router, and your full node won't be able to noticeably affect your flatmate's Internet experience. If you set a firewall rule to mark your full node's packets with a lower priority, then it won't affect your flatmate's Internet experience *whatsoever*.
I made a modification to my BitcoinD node so that it transmits all bulk block data with the "maximize throughput" IP ToS flag set, and my router sorts those so-marked packets into a lower priority band so they have no impact on my other Internet activities. My full node currently has 146 established connections, but I never notice any impact.

Dollars and gold are both relevant. Dollars are used for everyday transactions, and gold is used as a long-term store of value.

That's a bold statement, given that I can think of several ways in which RBF is superior and none in which CPFP is.
* CPFP only works if you have a change output.
* CPFP consumes additional blockchain space. Worse, it consumes more space for *each and every* time it's invoked.
* CPFP isn't as fee-efficient because the extra blockchain space has to be paid for in addition to the space of the parent.
* CPFP leaks privacy if it's known which party invoked it, as then the identities of the outputs of the original transaction are known.
How is CPFP superior?

Perhaps counter-intuitively, high on-chain fees may actually *help* LN. I could foresee a scenario wherein bitcoins already in the Lightning Network take on a higher market value than bitcoins not already in the Lightning Network simply because LN bitcoins will carry a lower associated cost to use. For example, a merchant may offer a discount for paying with bitcoins over Lightning Network versus paying with bitcoins on-chain because the LN bitcoins will be less costly for the merchant to use later on.

You're about to learn something! Bitcoin actually does have a "human" clock, and the oracle for it is all nodes in the network. Every block has a human-clock timestamp in its header, and blocks are required to carry a timestamp that is within a certain interval of the network-consensus time. The `nLockTime` mechanism that has been in Bitcoin since the beginning supports using the human-clock time as an alternative to the block height. It's not extremely precise, but it has a resolution that is finer than a day.

cited the classic implementation but is right that it is too cumbersome. My implementation derived the private key by applying the "scrypt" key derivation function to a string consisting of the user's login and passphrase and then would sign a challenge message from the server using the derived private key. So the key was never stored in the browser; it was re-derived on the client device at every use, which allowed the user to use any device. Initial signup involved the user's browser transmitting the public key to the server but not the passphrase or the private key. This way, even if the server's database were stolen, the information contained in it would be useless for authentication purposes. And crucially, if any authentication message were ever intercepted, the information in it would also be useless for any future authentications.

Or, if they believe that Bitcoin will go up in price, then they can actually purchase some bitcoins to back their customers' balances, to hedge their risk.

Nodes do communicate their local time as part of their opening handshake when connecting to other nodes. There isn't a strong consensus over human time throughout the network except what is in the block headers. Indeed, the purpose of putting timestamps in the block headers is to establish a strong consensus over human time. But each node does collect a set of time offsets for all the nodes it has connected to, and it picks the median offset to serve as its local view of the correct time. (This is to compensate for incorrectly set system clocks.)

You're right that wealthy people do not hold cash. That's because cash loses value due to inflation. Inflation forces wealthy people to make investments that they would not otherwise make.

Bitcoin, in its present form, is not suitable for retail point-of-sale transactions because zero-conf transactions are not guaranteed to confirm. (They never have been.) This is true even if the spender acts in good faith.
Full RBF would help the present situation because it would allow legitimate (i.e., economically beneficial) transactions to move up in priority while eventually bankrupting the bad actors who are spamming the network.
The tools for estimating fees can only take into account present and historical conditions. They cannot predict the future. If a sudden surge of transactions occurs after you've built your transaction but before it gets into a block, you may find that the fee you paid, which was perfectly reasonable at the time, is no longer sufficient.

Non-SegWit transactions are also secured "not by mathematics but by enforcement of the miners." There is no law of mathematics that says a miner can't allow a P2PKH output to be spent without a valid signature. The only thing protecting your bitcoins from being spent by others is the *consensus rule* that spending them requires a valid signature. Well, SegWit is a new consensus rule. What makes it slightly less safe than the existing consensus rules is that not all nodes will begin enforcing it at the same time. The activation threshold is 95%. If that's not certain enough for you, you don't have to hold your coins in SegWit addresses. Even after SegWit activation, your use of it is completely at your option. You can choose to continue paying higher fees and making non-SegWit transactions.

Yes, you absolutely can, but you may have difficulty getting your new transaction to propagate across the network to a miner since many nodes will not relay it since they see it as a "double-spend attempt." Nodes that implement "replace by fee" (RBF) will relay it, assuming you've bumped up the fee enough. If there are enough RBF-supporting nodes in the network, then you may be able to get your replacement transaction propagated all the way to some miners.

Absolutely we must assume this. It's the economically rational course of action. But this does not mean it's rational for miners to constrain supply at the present level forever.

Just supposition, of course, as I don't know who Satoshi really is/was. The best theory I've seen is that Satoshi was Dave Kleiman, a computer security expert who was associated with Craig Wright (the false prophet). Kleiman mortally injured himself by slipping and falling in the shower in late 2010. He died in 2013 from complications resulting from his fall. The theory is that Craig Wright knew Dave Kleiman owned a fortune in bitcoins, so Wright was trying to establish himself as Satoshi so he'd be legally entitled to Kleiman's bitcoins if ever they could be recovered.
Gizmodo has a good [article]( about Dave Kleiman.
@_date: 2017-04-18 15:43:01
You're right. That was in March 2014. Then again, it's possible that Craig Wright and/or Hal Finney (died August 2014) shared the login credentials for Satoshi's social accounts. It's plausible that "Satoshi" was a team but only Kleiman had the private keys to the bitcoins. It's even plausible that the private keys were divided up among the team members using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, which would explain why Kleiman wasn't able to cash out the bitcoins by himself.

A couple of points. 570 bytes is actually really large for a transaction. Typical transactions are more like half that size. And blocks aren't limited to 1 MB anymore. Indeed, most blocks are around 1.3 MB in size, and we've even had some over 2 MB.
You should think of on-chain Bitcoin transactions as being akin to international bank wire transfers. They're expensive and inappropriate for the vast majority of transactions. Everyday payments won't happen on chain. Just as you don't call up your bank to wire funds into Starbucks' corporate bank account when you buy a latte, neither will you post a Bitcoin transaction into the global ledger to buy your latte. Instead, you'll pay with a credit card denominated in BTC, which you'll pay off at the end of your billing cycle with a single on-chain transaction, or you'll pay on a higher layer such as the Lightning Network.

The questions you're asking having answers that fill entire books.

Friedman (Milton Friedman's son) published *The Machinery of Freedom* in 1973 to tackle those hard questions you're raising, and he's most recently updated it in 2014.

What contingent is that? SegWit comes with a block-size increase. It's not a block-size increase that the majority oppose; it's a hard fork. I personally think a hard fork would be fine if it were uncontroversial, but the Core devs have given up on trying to find an uncontroversial idea for a hard fork and have gone out of their way to develop SegWit as a soft fork because they believed this would be less controversial than any hard fork. Turns out it's still too controversial. Changing Bitcoin is hard, and that's good.

Bitcoin Core does not enable RBF by default, although there is a configuration option to make RBF the default. I'd caution against making RBF-eligible transactions when paying ShitPay invoices, as the RBF eligibility causes the transaction not to be recognized until it has been confirmed, and often that will be after the original invoice has expired. In other words, BitPay won't accept 0-conf transactions that are RBF-eligible — rightly so. RBF is great for moving your funds between your own wallets or paying a friend.

Sometimes there is. When debt is being repaid *en masse* and the money supply is contracting (fiat money *is* debt, so less debt means less money), one of the Fed's few tools for causing inflation through money supply expansion is to goad banks into lending out money to businesses and the public rather than depositing it at the Fed.
*Of course* more borrowing/debt doesn't directly translate to a healthier economy. (Actually I'm inclined to believe that financing economic growth through *savings* is overall healthier than financing it through borrowing.) But the Fed has no levers it can pull to improve the actual health of the economy — that would fall to Congress — so it does the only thing it can do to try to meet its mandate: it adjusts various banking parameters (federal funds rate, reserve ratios, etc.) to try to modulate the amount of borrowing that goes on in the economy. When borrowing no longer translates to a healthy economy, the Fed is out of options. We are approaching that point.

That's not what was saying. Bitcoin is indeed near its transaction limit. That's bad, and it's a direct result of the block-size limit. No one contests that. The issue is that raising the block-size limit may *also* be bad for Bitcoin, as it would limit who is able to run a Bitcoin node — essentially to only people in first-world countries, which is against the spirit of Bitcoin. It's also not an actual solution to the underlying problem, which is that broadcasting every transaction to every node simply isn't going to scale to a point where every person in the world is making multiple transactions per day. A real solution will change the transaction distribution topology, perhaps to something more like a distributed hash table, where each node only sees a subset of the total records in the distributed database. It's hard to get right, though, as nodes still need to be able to verify the validity of the subset of transactions they do see, and they must see the transactions pertinent to their own wallets.

Short positions can't "pull the market down" without limit. Eventually the short positions need to be closed, and this reverses the downward pressure that opening the short positions had put on the price.
Short positions do not affect the demand for holding bitcoins. They do affect the apparent supply, but unlike traditional commodities (such as gold and silver) there is no real cost incurred to take delivery of bitcoins, so investors will be unlikely to accept "promises to deliver bitcoins on demand" in lieu of actual bitcoins. This means there is a limit to the extent to which the shorts can expand the apparent supply of bitcoins. And since market price is just the ratio of demand to supply, this means that there is a limit to the extent to which the shorts can suppress the price.

I'm not sure there's any way to explain index funds to a five-year-old because the explanation requires the concept of proportionality. Index funds buy and hold stocks in amounts that are proportional to those stocks' market capitalizations. This is a purely passive allocation strategy that requires no decision-making by humans, making it entirely dispassionate. That is both its strength and its weakness. It's a strength because fads, rumors, and hunches do not factor in. It's a weakness because it's completely at the mercy of herd mentality. Passive investing merely follows what the herd is doing. It makes no judgments, good or bad, about the companies it's investing in. Therefore, if *everyone* (or a large majority) were using passive investment strategies, then there would be no significant judgments being passed on the companies, and the prices of their stocks would be "coasting," disconnected from the realities of the companies' performance and governance.

Amen, brother. "RBF" codified a practice that has always been possible. As early as 2013, I was already taking advantage of replacing a low-priority transaction with a higher priority one spending the same inputs. This was well before "RBF" was an acronym on anyone's mind. Satoshi always intended for transactions to be replaceable until confirmed; that was the whole point of the `nSequence` field in each transaction input. Granted, Satoshi's original vision for replaceable transactions was flawed and required some work to make it practicable, but even before "RBF" became an official policy, it was possible (and rational) for miners to accept replacement transactions paying higher fees. I for one was running my full node with the "full RBF" patch long before so-called "opt-in" RBF was implemented in Bitcoin Core. The point is that replaceable transactions have always been possible because there's no way for the consensus protocol to prevent it. A well-known rule in software development is "if a thing *can* happen, then it *will* happen eventually." For this reason, accepting transactions with zero confirmations has always been foolish. Lightning makes it safe for the first time in the history of Bitcoin. That's one reason why Lightning is a game changer.

The thing that's ridiculous about Java's memory usage isn't specific to Java. At any given moment, the process is using more RAM than it strictly needs to be using to hold all its live objects. Or in other words, there is always some garbage being held in memory. This is the nature of garbage-collected languages and is just as true of Python, Node.js, Ruby, and all the other super high-level languages du jour. One particular annoyance of these systems is that they have a tendency not to deallocate pages of RAM after they've run a garbage collection, so any temporary spike in a program's legitimate RAM usage translates to a permanently increased memory footprint. It would be easy for the runtime to deallocate the pages (which doesn't require unmapping them), but both the page table modifications and TLB flush that's required when deallocating pages and the subsequent page faults if/when those addresses are accessed again cause performance hits that the makers of these systems are unwilling to incur. They'd rather just hog memory for no good reason and prevent the OS from using it for productive purposes like page cache. The worst is when pages containing nothing but garbage get flushed out to swap and then subsequently have to be read back in when the process wants to start filling them with live objects, even though they could simply be zero-filled on use without needing any disk access at all, but of course the kernel doesn't know this because the runtime doesn't communicate it. SMDH. &lt;/rant&gt;

One problem with this reasoning is that no cryptocurrency — even Bitcoin — is being used as a *currency* yet. They're all just being treated as speculative vehicles. Trading in them has been mostly a technical game. It has hardly mattered what the technology underlying each coin looks like. However, as soon as one crypto actually achieves the role of a currency, then the network effect that has long been predicted to rule supreme will loft that one currency very suddenly and quickly to such status that the altcoins will look very much like penny stocks.

If all the current holders of the contract want the promised bitcoins, then you won't be able to close your position and will actually be forced to deliver the bitcoins that you promised to deliver when you wrote and sold the contract into the market.

"Should've used Bitcoin!"
I'm no fan of Maduro at all, but I find it pretty alarming that the Bank of England is just flat-out saying, "no, you can't have your gold back." To me, that is a great example of how Bitcoin is superior to gold. Then again, I wouldn't be surprised to see central banks holding bitcoin reserves at Coinbase in the future, and the same thing will happen there: U.S. government doesn't like foreign government; foreign government doesn't get access to their bitcoins. But at least Bitcoin private keys are cheaper to store securely than tons of gold bars, so maybe not as many governments will make the mistake of storing their private keys in foreign hands.

With electric cars, it's more that the exhaust, fumes, and pollution become optional. You have to get the energy to charge it from somewhere. If you want to spend the money on a green energy source like wind or solar to charge your car, good on you. I suspect most will plug their cars into the plain old grid. Now, that said, the pollution per megajoule is a lot lower at the scale of a coal-fired power plant than it is at the scale of a gasoline-burning internal combustion engine, so even running on fossil fuels an electric car pollutes less.

Your reason for getting into Bitcoin is almost identical to my own. (Only real difference is I was a silver bug before Bitcoin.) What has really gotten me down the past couple of years is that the premise that Bitcoin cannot be diluted beyond its preset schedule has seemingly become effectively meaningless due to the unlimited number of copycoins and shitforks. I keep hoping that all the shitcoins will fall away when Bitcoin transitions from speculative vehicle to currency and we will be left with a truly limited-supply commodity money, but I am not certain that it will actually happen that way.

No two causally linked events that are separated by some physical distance ever occur truly instantaneously, but to a human-scale approximation you're correct *in the ideal case*. At global scale, though, Lightning Network transactions will take a few seconds to route. There's an added delay for each "hop" your payment takes as it is routed through the network. And if any of those intermediate nodes aren't responding instantly — maybe they're on wireless links or have just disappeared — then it can take longer for your route to fail and for your payment to try a different route. The behavior we're seeing on the fledgling Lightning Network of today is not really demonstrative of what we'll see when the network is fully scaled out, as most LN payments today don't take multiple hops through the network, whereas most LN payments of the future most certainly will.

You have the cash flow backwards there. Indeed, that model will not work in the absence of the patent system. A different model could, though.
Imagine a well-known pharmaceutical company wants to research and develop a new drug to stimulate hair regrowth. Under the old model, they'd spend a bunch of the company's money (or borrow a bunch of money on the company's credit), pay people big money over several years to R&amp;D the drug, and then they'd try to sell their drug exclusively to make back their R&amp;D costs plus some profit before their patent expires.
How would this pharmaceutical company R&amp;D new drugs without patents? Simple: presales. They announce their intention to develop the drug, amass a crowd of people who want to buy the drug, accept preorders from those people, and then use that money to develop the drug. If they can't drum up enough preorders to finance the R&amp;D, then it's a bad project that they shouldn't pursue.

You're using Keynesian concepts of inflation and deflation. As has been brought up many times here and elsewhere, these concepts are pointless to discuss, as almost no investor is exposed to price inflation. The concepts of inflation and deflation that make sense to discuss when discussion the fundamentals of a currency are the Austrian concepts, which regard the *supply* of the currency. An inflationary currency is precisely one whose supply is being inflated. If all other economic factors were held constant, then the purchasing power of one unit of the currency would be declining because each unit represents a shrinking fraction of the total. The reason I got into Bitcoin was that, for the first time ever, it's a currency that cannot be inflated after its production schedule has been completed. I'm so sick of governments continually sucking value out of the economy by printing new units of the currency.

One of them is probably the same card as you have (BofA Cash Rewards), but when you're a Preferred Rewards Platinum Honors member, they give you a 75% boost on those rewards rates, so that's where my 3.5% on groceries and 5.25% on gas come from. The 2.625% on everything comes from the BofA Travel Rewards, which ordinarily gives 1.5% back on everything, but that 75% boost brings it up to 2.625%.

The "big deal" is not paying more than you have to to get your transaction confirmed as quickly as you need it to be. Of course you can always blast several dollars' worth of bitcoins and get your transaction in the very next block, but what if you only need it to confirm within the next 12 hours? 10 sat/byte might be more than you need to pay, or it might not be enough.

Right. Once you have more than half of the hash power, you effectively have 100% of it because you can simply refuse to mine blocks atop any competitor's blocks. That's why a "51% attack" is so devastating. The attacker can censor transactions for a long as they retain hash power superiority. And it's self-reinforcing, as the attacker will be reaping *all* of the mining revenues and shutting everyone else out from collecting any revenues, so it will be hard for competitors to acquire new hardware to defeat the attack, whereas the attacker will have boatloads of revenue to keep adding new hardware.

Isn't LN *less* private, though?

Okay, so I crunched the actual numbers on my node. Yay, data!
My `chainstate/LOG` file spans from 2017-09-10 22:18:00 to 2017-09-16 11:50:44. (Evidently BitcoinD stopped writing LevelDB `LOG` files in 0.15.0.) I used the following command to add up all the "bytes" counts mentioned in my `chainstate/LOG` except those in lines containing `=&gt;`, as those lines merely summarize the preceding `Generated table` lines, and I don't want to double-count.
    $ sed -e '/=&gt;/!s/^.* \([0-9]\+\) bytes.*$/\1/;t;d' LOG | awk '{ total += $1 } END { print total }'
    168122827375
So in ~5.564 days, my node wrote ~168 GB in its `chainstate` directory. That's ~30.2 GB/day. At this rate, it would write ~11.0 TB in a year.
So, not quite the calamity that I was estimating but also not a trivial write load. I'm the kind of person who uses hardware for a very long time. My daily-driver computer is almost 11 years old now and has a 6-drive RAID that is just about as old. (I think I've replaced a couple of drives over the years.) My smartphone is a Galaxy S3, which is now running Nougat, thanks to LineageOS. So I am wary of software whose behaviors needlessly strain my hardware's endurance.
I will eventually have to replace the hardware that my full node runs on, and I will most likely use SSDs, but before I'll run BitcoinD on the new rig, I'll rewrite Bitcoin's indexing engine to optimize for low write amplification and cheap random access rather than the large streaming (re)writes that LevelDB is optimized for.

You're talking about polling again. Push would be where you have the process on the watch register a callback function to be invoked when new configuration is pushed to the watch. It could be a file system notification (in the spirit of inotify), or it could be a socket notification (i.e., returning from a long-blocked `recv`, `select`, or `epoll_wait` call), or it could be a Bluetooth callback. The point in any case is that the watch should expend exactly zero CPU cycles until and unless the host device sends a new configuration to it. You do not want to be waking up the watch periodically to "check" whether new configuration is available. You want the host device to wake up the watch (and the process on the watch) when the host sends a new configuration.

I thought this too, and it's why I have never gotten into altcoins. I always believed the theory that no altcoin could overtake Bitcoin's network effects (unless it was as far better than Bitcoin as Bitcoin is better than fiat, which no altcoin to date is). And yet, we still have a massive altcoin capitalization, greater than 50% of all cryptocurrency capitalization. So although I wish that you are correct, evidently network effects don't operate on cryptocurrencies in the way we were expecting.

The dbcache parameter doesn't affect how much data gets written to the LevelDB databases. The cache is a read cache, not a write cache.

Flash memory discharges over time. Recordable optical media (e.g., CD-R[W], DVD±R[W]) degrade over time. Magnetic media (e.g., hard disks, floppy disks, tape) retain data basically forever but are vulnerable to external magnetic fields. Paper rots and crumbles eventually, and ink fades. Most of these are destroyed or rendered unreadable by water, and all are vulnerable to fire.
The best strategy I've seen for extreme durability is to engrave your private key or seed words on a metal ingot. A "brass bar" is a common suggestion, but brass is actually a fairly poor choice due to its relatively low melting point. Titanium, though expensive, is a superb choice, as no house fire would ever get hot enough to melt a titanium plate, and also titanium is very resistant to corrosion.

Transactions never expire, though they can become invalid if one or more of their inputs get spent by another transaction that gets confirmed.
Nodes typically do drop old unconfirmed transactions from their mempools after some time, but there is no hard limit on how long it can take for all nodes to forget about a transaction.
You can try abandoning your transaction and making a new one with an adequate fee. Just be sure you spend at least one of the same previous transaction outputs in your new transaction as you did in your old transaction, or otherwise there would be a chance that both transactions could confirm.
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:15:52
72 hours was only the default. (The default is now much longer.) But that's irrelevant since there's nothing that actually invalidates a transaction after any amount of time. Conceivably a node could keep your low-fee transaction in its mempool and keep rebroadcasting it forever. This is why RBF is so important.

Even if Bitcoin were to replace all other currencies in the world, there would still be orders of magnitude more *derivatives* than actual currency.
One of the theories for why Satoshi chose 21M bitcoins as the limit is that this quantity would allow for each satoshi to be worth approximately what one U.S. cent is today, assuming Bitcoin replaced all other currencies worldwide. This implies that all currencies worldwide are presently worth around $21 trillion. Again, your $1 quadrillion number includes derivatives, which are a separate matter from currency.

Yep, this is exactly right. But sometimes you find businesses that offer a discount for paying in cash. And sometimes, particularly with small businesses where you can talk to the owner directly, you can simply ask for a "cash discount" and get it. Generally business owners hate accepting credit cards but have no other choice because it's how the majority of customers want to pay.
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:15:34
Correct. To expound: BIP70 has the merchant's system sign the payment request (which includes the merchant's address and requested amount, among other things) using a private key known only by the merchant (not accessible to the employees). The merchant's public key is communicated with the request, and the public key is signed by a Certificate Authority. The customer's device trusts the CA and verifies the CA's signature of the merchant's public key and then verifies the merchant's signature of the payment request. The reason this is frowned upon by some here is that it is neither trustless nor decentralized, as it relies on the corruptible Public-Key Infrastructure system, but so does every HTTPS web site that we all trust with very sensitive data every day. BIP70 is no *worse* than a credit-card transaction for autonomy; it's just not much/any better.

I don't know where the line should be drawn between "okay to kill" and "not okay to kill." Most people have a somewhat inconsistent take on that — they have no problem with pigs being slaughtered by the millions, but dogs? Cats? Unconscionable! That's a strange line to draw as I see it. Personally I draw the line between fish and land animals (reptiles, birds, and mammals), so I'm a pescetarian. I draw that line far away from where I suspect it probably should be (between birds and mammals) just to be on the really safe side. I don't want to be unknowingly committing murder. My own rule of thumb is that I don't contribute to market demand for animal slaughter, so I won't buy meat, and I won't take meat from meat-eaters (who would just go buy more meat to feed themselves if I took the meat they offered me), but I *will* eat meat if it's definitely going to be wasted and I can't find any meat-eaters to consume it.

Is that really true, though? Send a transaction with a 2-sat/byte fee, and it might *never* confirm.

Well, fiat money is also imbued with value by virtue of governments' forcing people, through threats of violence or actual violence, to use it. But what really shocks people is that a money can be valuable without any coercive force whatsoever. It really makes them start to question their government's thuggish tactics.

“You have been taught that the real value of any group of people – be it a social group, an employee group, a management group, whatever – is based on diversity.  This is a favored liberal ideal because diversity is based not on an individual's abilities or character, but on a person's identity and status as a member of a group.  Yes – it's that liberal group identity thing again.  Within the great diversity movement, group identification – be it racial, gender based, or some other minority status – means more than the individual's integrity, character, or other qualifications.”

Indeed, "the market" is necessary but not sufficient. And the reason we don't already have anarchy is the most obvious one: it hasn't yet become practicable. Monopoly governments still produce superior results versus anarchic societal structures. But this is not a steady state. Barring some kind of existential catastrophe, technological progress marches in only one direction. Technology is what will enable society to be structured as anarchy with superior results versus being structured with monopoly governments. Bitcoin is a key piece of tech that will advance us toward that threshold, but there are yet more pieces that we need and do not yet have. We will get there; it's almost inevitable.

Exchanges that want to list SilbertCoin can and will implement their own replay protection. It'll be messier than native replay protection, but it's not fundamentally all that hard to implement. They just have to make sure that every transaction they publish has at least one input that is valid on only one side of the fork. They would probably add a tiny output to every transaction whose sole purpose would be to serve as that valid-on-only-one-side input in their next transaction.

I wouldn't, necessarily. I'd buy whichever one is expected to have the higher resale value. That's not necessarily the one that was more costly to produce.

I agree that eventually the problem will solve itself, as global networking capacity is growing faster than the human population. If cryptocurrencies had come about perhaps 30 years later, there would likely have been no issues with broadcasting every coffee transaction in the world to every node in the world. But Bitcoin came into existence in 2009, and even today, eight years later, we still do not have sufficient global network capacity to distribute billions of transactions per day to millions of nodes around the planet. A workaround is required until the Internet infrastructure catches up. I'm hopeful for blockchain sharding as a long-term solution that can be phased out as global network capacity improves. I think your time frame of 5 years is far too optimistic. I'd say more like 20-30 years.

Good wallet apps have a periodic timer that wakes up the app in the background every few days to check for cheating attempts. As long as you don't turn off your phone or lose connectivity for more than two weeks (maybe minus a few days), it's impossible for you to be cheated successfully. And keep in mind, your channel peers can't know for certain whether you're watching for them to cheat while simply not connecting to them, so they probably won't risk trying to cheat.

You can't create outgoing channels *to* other nodes, as Breez has no on-chain wallet with which you could fund any channel openings.
You can accept incoming channels *from* other nodes (if you use the dev console to connect outbound to them first), but I saw a reported issue on their GitHub saying this worked but that payments over the other channels didn't show up in the UI's payment history list, although the balance was correctly updated.

The strategic mistake Bitcoin Cash made was that it only co-opted Bitcoin's transaction history but not Bitcoin's user base. In contrast, by refusing to implement replay protection, SegWit2x is essentially not making that same mistake. The goal of SegWit2x is to *replace* Bitcoin, and to do that, they need to co-opt Bitcoin's user base in addition to its transaction history. This means they must have all ambivalent users of Bitcoin automatically become ambivalent users of SegWit2x. Only way to achieve that is to replay everything on the SegWit2x chain.

That's a brilliant way to verify that the private key and address really go together without ever loading the private key onto a computer.

Privacy can (and should) be implemented in higher layers, leaving the base layer as simple as possible (but no simpler).
Just look at Tor for a great example. The Internet's base layer doesn't implement strong privacy, so we have implemented privacy at a higher layer. And for those who don't especially care about their digital privacy, they don't have to suffer the overhead of Tor.
Similarly, Bitcoin users don't have to suffer the overhead of strong privacy unless they choose to use a higher layer that implements it. The Lightning Network actually provides privacy in the same way as Tor: through onion routing. So if you want very cheap and nearly instant Bitcoin payments, you already get Tor-like privacy as a built-in bonus on Lightning Network.

The concept of "zero confirmation" doesn't apply in the Lightning Network, as there are no confirmations at all. When you receive money via LN, that takes the form of one of your channel peers agreeing that you are now owed a larger portion of the channel funds (and they are owed a lesser portion), and they sign a new commitment transaction to attest cryptographically to this agreement. If they ever tried to renege, your node would broadcast the commitment that they signed, and you would take what's yours by force (of the blockchain). But because you have this power, there's nothing they could gain by reneging, so they likely won't do it.

I guess you've never heard of a bitfield in C.
    struct igadjeed {

    };
You can assign the value 2^(50)-1 into that bitfield, you'll have no problem, but if you try to assign 2^(50), then the compiler will tell you that the value is too large for the destination. Thus, you really do have a 51-bit signed integer type. Assuming `long` is natively 64 bits, then you have 13 unused bits in your struct that you could use for other purposes without increasing `sizeof(struct igadjeed)`.

Not just the transaction ID but the full transaction. (And actually, "txid" is a misnomer, as there are no transaction identifiers in Bitcoin.

Take an *n*-digit integer in base *s* and convert it to a 256-bit integer in base 2. The *n*-digit integer in base *s* starts out with all digits being 0, and then the digits are filled from the die rolls starting with the most significant digit. If at any point the *n*-digit integer exceeds the cyclic order of the secp256k1 generator point, then the process resets and starts over.


I intentionally avoided hashing the input rolls because then I'd be depending on the hash algorithm being strong. Again, the entire point of this exercise is to reduce the key generation process entirely to meatspace: rolling a physical die directly generates the private key, with no hand-wavy, "trust us, it works" magic algorithm. SHA-256 is probably perfectly fine, but my method of diceware eliminates it from the equation. Likewise, I wouldn't want to use any kind of PRNG algorithm when I already have a perfect RNG.

The `3ERn76…` address *can't* be the address of an open Lightning channel, as it's not a P2WSH address; it's a P2SH address.


That's certainly possible, but we won't know whether they have until/unless you can find the transaction that funded your channel with them.


That's exactly what happens when a channel is force-closed. If ACINQ were to force-close your channel, then the transaction that force-closed the channel (called a "commitment transaction") would pay out your funds into an address that was supplied by your Eclair app when you opened your channel. That address would have been derived from your Eclair app wallet's master seed, which is what you restored. Thus, if ACINQ had force-closed your channel, then your funds would now be sitting at an address that is spendable by your restored wallet.

Futures markets are only able to fuck the commodities spot markets because taking physical delivery of physical goods is costly, so almost no one does it, and thus there can be many more futures contracts outstanding than could ever realistically be delivered, and thus the perceived supply of the commodity is greater than the actual supply, and thus the market price is artificially suppressed. This effect doesn't apply to bitcoin because taking delivery of bitcoins has no associated marginal cost, and so there won't be an enormous, perpetual float of futures contracts that only get rolled forward but never delivered.

That's to be expected if ACINQ have not force-closed your channel yet.


For the purposes of this discussion, I consider each installation of Eclair to be an instance. If you uninstall the app and reinstall it, or even if you just wipe the app's data, then you have switched to a new instance of the app. Simply updating the app without clearing its data does not create a new instance of the app.


You are mistaken. The funds now sitting at that address cannot have been a payout from a Lightning channel, as the only [transaction]( paying into that address has two inputs and one output, whereas every Lightning commitment transaction has **one** input (of a P2WSH output) and one or two outputs.
Keep looking through your historical transactions. The funding output of a Lightning channel (as I mentioned above) is a P2WSH output, so you're looking for a Bech32 address (one beginning `bc1`).
And incidentally, don't use Blockchain.com. That company has a long history of incompetence.

You're right about most of the pros you listed. The con I might disagree with, as the TI-89 is a fairly well-known piece of hardware among engineers and math geeks, and it's readily available in stores.
The private key does linger on the stack after the program returns to the shell, but I suspect it would quickly get obliterated by further use of the calculator. In particular, the code never allocates any memory on the heap, so the areas of memory that it does use (on the stack) are likely to be overwritten soon after use. Do note that the key will remain in the "Program I/O" frame buffer until you clear it. (Switching back to the home screen does not clear the "Program I/O" screen.)

That could be done, but it would complicate the base conversion code, which presently assumes that the input number is in base *s*, where *s* is the number of sides.
The 256-bit private key is computed as the sum:
*r*[0]·*s*^(*n*−1) + *r*[1]·*s*^(*n*−2) + … + *r*[*n*−1]·*s*^0
* *s* is the number of sides
* *n* is the number of required rolls, which is equal to ⌈256·log(2)/log(*s*)⌉

Interest rates being pushed lower than what a free market could sustain is what gets us into this mess in the first place. If interest rates are low, then this is a signal to businesses that sufficient capital has been saved up such that now is a good time to begin long-term, capital-intensive development projects. But if the interest rates are being held low *artificially*, then the savings don't really exist, and it's actually *not* a good time to begin capital improvement projects, and many of the businesses that do will find that the real resources to complete their projects do not exist, and those projects will have to be abandoned, which in many cases means they'll have squandered all the capital they invested in those projects up to that point. This is the Austrian economic theory of business cycles, which puts the blame squarely on central banks for fixing interest rates lower than they would be if they were allowed to float on a free market.

You're right, but what values should the other 96 bits of the private key take? If they take deterministic values (possibly depending upon the values of the 160 randomly chosen bits), then a brute-force search for a suitable private key "only" needs to iterate over 2^160 possibilities. Without determinism in any of the bits of the private key, then it is *possible* (albeit unlikely) that no permutation of 160 bits, with the other 96 bits being determined, will yield a working private key. In other words, RIPEMD160 might not produce all 2^160 possible outputs from input messages containing only 160 variable bits. It's a stretch, assuming the hash functions work as intended, but my goal in creating this was to assume that the hash functions are *not* reliable for their intended purposes. (That's why I don't simply hash the input dice rolls but instead do a base conversion to build the private key from the input rolls verbatim.)

I second the suggestion to use Breez. You can add more satoshis to your Lightning balance by sending from a regular Bitcoin wallet to an on-chain address. Breez executes a submarine swap, which is a trustless means of taking your on-chain bitcoins while simultaneously sending you a payment on Lightning. It's a similar idea to a cross-chain atomic swap: either both payments happen or neither does. I have personally tested the failure scenario on Breez, and sure enough, the app enabled me to take back my deposit after two days (the timeout for the submarine swap). Very nice implementation.

The technical hurdles aren't quite as bad as you imply. Some reality checks…


In reality, competing miners (pools and other mining entities) begin mining an empty block as soon as they have received a new block header. They will receive and validate the transactions in the new block in parallel, and once the full block has been validated, then the competing miner will begin mining a non-empty block. So the miner that finds a block has a small financial advantage in mining the next block, as they can fill the new block with transactions from the get-go, but competing miners aren't at so great a disadvantage as you claim, as they can begin mining atop the new block before they've fully received it.


In reality, miners observe transactions in the network as they occur, and they cache the signature checks of those transactions. When a block is found, validating the block is very fast since almost all of the signatures contained in it were already validated and cached.

Long-term loans of fiat currency charge an interest rate that compensates for inflation and provides the lender an income on top of that. The same would be true of bitcoin loans, but because the (price) inflation rate of bitcoin is negative, the interest rate could turn out to be positive, zero, or negative.
Would any lender lend out bitcoins at a negative interest rate? I wouldn't think so, as they could do better simply by sitting on their coins. However, banks do sometimes invest in bonds with negative real rates of return, so it's not unheard of. But more to the point: maybe it's not actually all that healthy to base an economy on borrowing. A healthy money like Bitcoin might naturally discourage unhealthy practices, which may include money lending.

You're absolutely right about the timing side channel. I coded this for best possible speed, without concern for timing attacks. I don't expect anyone to use this while being watched.
I am impressed that you went through and analyzed my code enough to make such informed statements about it. :)
I certainly did not mean to imply that this is production-ready or should be used by anyone for any serious storage of funds. This is, as you say, a "cute hack." I personally will use it because I have been using this elliptic-curve math code in production on a site that handles thousands of bitcoins, but **I can make no warranties about its suitability for any purpose.**
Code is, for the most part, self-documenting. (There's no point in adding a comment to the `add256` function that reads "Adds two 256-bit integers" because that's obvious from the function's signature.) The only parts of this code that may be somewhat unclear in their implementation are the prime-field and elliptic-curve arithmetic functions. I did add a few comments in `ecp_dbl256` so you can see the methodology behind the operations.
Regarding the order of evaluation of function arguments, I do not believe there are any instances in this code where the order matters, as in all places where more than one argument to a function call is the result of another function call, the function calls have different destination arguments. I am aware that C does not specify an order of evaluation.

SSL's trust model is designed around the assumption that users will not manually check the public key of the site to which they're connecting, not even once. Tor hidden services violate this assumption, as users must carefully check the .onion address *once*. If you were to eliminate the ease-of-use requirement from SSL, then SSL would offer the same degree of security (albeit not the same degree of privacy) as Tor hidden services.
I have to say, I believe SSL's trust model was a poor choice in hindsight. I would prefer a system more like OpenSSH uses, where you are asked to verify a key fingerprint the first time you connect to a site, and then if the site's key changes upon a subsequent visit, you get a very ominous security warning that there may be a MITM. It could be enhanced with a PGP-style web of trust, so if you know some people whom you trust to be thorough about checking keys, then you can rely on their signatures and not have to check sites' key fingerprints yourself.

Respectfully, you're wrong because you haven't thought this through fully enough yet. Once you use a computer to generate a private key, you can *NEVER AGAIN* connect that computer to the Internet. Even rebooting before reconnecting won't help you if a piece of malicious firmware has stashed your key in non-volatile storage somewhere and is waiting for the next opportunity to transmit it over the Internet. And you really have no guarantees that the hardware doesn't have other means of communicating with the outside world. A radio can be integrated into any of the dozens of chipsets populating the circuit boards in your computer. The point is, you're trusting a lot more than just Electrum and Tails when you generate a private key offline.

Hmm, this runs completely contrary to my understanding of legal tender law. (Admittedly, I am not a lawyer.) I've always been told that it's not possible to create a debt obligation that cannot be paid in legal tender. For instance, if I lend some silver to a friend, I cannot require repayment in silver. I can *accept* repayment in silver, but if my friend offers me an equivalent quantity of dollars, I have to take it, or the friend can get a judge to expunge the debt.
I've seen discussion saying that the COMEX can use this legal trick to avoid defaulting on silver contracts. Even though they're supposed to deliver silver bars to a futures contract holder upon request, they can also simply deliver dollars and get out of their obligation scot-free.

I think you may not fully understand how Lightning works. There is no counterparty risk. The worst a counterparty can do is to force the closure of a channel, in which case both parties get paid out (on chain) the agreed amounts.
Closing a channel carries a cost, so participants in the Lightning Network have an incentive to avoid closing channels. I would actually expect banks and other large financial institutions to close their channels at a significantly *lesser* rate than the general user base since their nodes are likely to have higher availability.

Dollars, euros, pounds, are not payment methods; they are currencies. Payment methods are like: cash, Visa, PayPal, bank wire. It just so happens that Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment method, so that's a little confusing. But now there exists a payment method that uses the Bitcoin currency but is not the Bitcoin payment method: namely, Lightning Network.


Definitely not all. It's common for Asian currencies to use only a single unit name and not to have fractional parts. Japanese yen is a case in point. 20,000¥ would be a reasonable amount to spend on a fancy dinner.

That's still a synchronization at startup, although it's a lot faster than scanning the chain since it's offloaded entirely to their server.

Full nodes won't relay blocks that they believe to be invalid. If a contingent of miners (or even all miners) are attempting to change the core rules of Bitcoin — for example, to continue mining 25 BTC per block after the next scheduled halving — then the full nodes running the original rules will not relay those blocks to other nodes. By running a full node, you're contributing an additional rule check on every transaction and every block.
People informally say the miners' job is to verify the transactions on the network, but actually this is *every* full node's job. The miners' job is really to attach proof of work to the transactions to make them irreversible.

You do need the arbitrator's public key up front in order to set up a multi-sig escrow. But this would be public knowledge. In fact, you could construct a multi-sig escrow with several interchangeable arbitrators, any one of which could act with the buyer or seller to release the funds, but in no case could any group of arbitrators collude to take the money without the signature of either the buyer or the seller.
An arbitrator could certainly refuse to arbitrate your dispute if you had not paid in advance at the time of setting up the escrow, but it would not be in their interest to do so, as they would be deciding to take no profit (by refusing to arbitrate) in lieu of taking a profit (by agreeing to arbitrate). It's in the interest of the arbitrator to provide service, even if the parties did not prepay.

That's a very defeatist attitude and not at all realistic. You don't need capital to create value. You can be an artist or an inventor or a maker. You can practice and become highly proficient in a value-generating venture that requires practically no capital investment.
Besides, plenty of people become wealthy (or at least "well off") despite starting out with nothing. Sure, it's easier for the people who were born with every opportunity handed to them, but the beauty of a market economy is that anyone can make something of themselves with enough self-discipline and enough ambition. A real illness I see everywhere is that the poor have simply given up. They don't know their own potential, so they never try. Of course, it doesn't help that the state blocks them at every on-ramp with onerous regulations and licensing requirements.

I think the issue is that a court could claim that the market value of the silver _at the time the loan was made_ is the amount of USD that may be repaid. In other words, the court will treat the loan as though it were denominated in USD all along, when probably the intent of structuring the loan using silver was to avoid losing value to inflation over the lifetime of the loan.
The government has a really bad habit of pretending that USD holds its value over time despite over a century of direct evidence to the contrary.

I'm not sure you're right about that. For starters, when credit cards came out, they were "charge cards"; there was no option to carry a balance. People didn't see why they should go to all the trouble of having their card imprinted and signing the slip when they could just write a check to accomplish the same thing. Now we have a similar conundrum with Bitcoin, except that Bitcoin really does have an advantage over credit cards in that it's a push-style payment.

If it says "Start over!", it's because you've rolled a number that can't possibly be the first "digit" in your base-18 key. (The resulting private key would be greater than the cyclic order of the generator point on the secp256k1 curve.) If you just want it to shut up and let you proceed, you can answer "1" for the first roll. Depending on the number of sides your die has, "1" may be the only legal first roll anyway.
By the way, the correct way to use the program with three 6-sided dice is to answer 6 sides and then input each die separately. (If you answer 18 sides, this is not right, as there is no way to roll a "1" or a "2" if you're adding together three dice.)

I think I get what you're trying to say, but you must be saying it wrong because the math doesn't make sense. If *N* nodes upload a block 8 times each, on average, then the block is uploaded *N*\*8 times in total. If a block is uploaded *N*\*8 times in total, then it is downloaded *N*\*8 times in total. (Every transmission of a block over the Internet involves exactly one uploader and one downloader.) So if there are only *N* nodes but each block is downloaded *N*\*8 times in total, then each node is downloading each block 8 times, on average. But in reality each node only downloads each block once.

Agreed. A transaction is Not Spam if it pays a competitive transaction fee, even if it just represents one party sending bitcoins to itself.

The Federal Reserve is a private company too, and it was created *specifically* so that it *could* create money out of thin air since the U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from making anything but gold and silver legal tender.

I honestly wouldn't go with a mobile wallet like Mycelium in that profession. It's too dangerous, as you could be forced to give the bitcoins back or be mugged. The beauty of Bitcoin for people who work in riskier industries it's that it's possible to receive payments without having the ability to send payments. You can keep your private key safely at home and only bring your public address with you on the job. Clients can pay your public address, and you can verify that they paid you, but there would be no physical way that you could send the money back even if your life depended on it, which hopefully it won't! Much safer than carrying around cash, in which case you can be robbed.

To be clear, I was only pointing out that a payee who receives payment through an unpublished channel cannot assume that the ultimate originator of the payment was in fact the peer on the other end of the unpublished channel *unless that peer is an unpublished node*.
This payment is entirely possible, for example:
    Alice —(published)—&gt; Charlie —(unpublished)—&gt; Uhura
Upon receiving such a payment, Uhura would be unable to discern whether the originator of the payment was Charlie or someone else (Alice in this example). Uhura's invoice would include a hint of the fees that one would need to pay to forward a payment across the Charlie→Uhura half-channel, so Alice would have all the information she needs to route a payment through Charlie to Uhura.
So, here's what Charlie knows:
* Every payment that Charlie *routes* via the Charlie→Uhura half-channel is ultimately destined for Uhura **if** Uhura is an unpublished node.
    * If Uhura is a published node (meaning: she has at least one published channel), then Charlie can originate payments to payees other than Uhura and route them through the unpublished Charlie→Uhura half-channel.
* Every payment that Charlie *receives* via the Uhura→Charlie half-channel ultimately originated at Uhura **if** Uhura is an unpublished node.
    * If Uhura is a published node, then Charlie can only infer that Uhura is the ultimate originator of payments he receives via the Uhura→Charlie half-channel *if Charlie did not solicit those payments with an invoice that hints about the Uhura→Charlie half-channel*.


Right: the biggest negative impact on privacy comes by being an unpublished *node*. Merely ~~using~~ [**edit:** *sending over*] unpublished *channels* isn't all that damning if you are a published node. [**edit:** *You still don't want to receive via an unpublished channel because then your peer knows you are the ultimate recipient unless your peer originated the payment, in which case your peer knows the ultimate recipient anyway.*]

`dd` only asks the drive to return the data that was most recently written to it. That's not what OP needs. There are ways of finding what was *previously* written on the disk. They involve physically disassembling the drive, scanning its magnetic recording media using a very high-resolution read head, and running some very high-grade statistical analyses to try to glean from the fringes of the data track what bits used to be there. It's kind of like you have a stack of colored "dot" stickers, and the hard drive itself will only tell you what color the top sticker is, but if you can pull out the medium and put it under a microscope, you may be able to figure out the color of the second-to-top or third-to-top sticker in the stack.

Basically, there are two sides to every Bitcoin "account": a private key and a public key. The private key lets you send bitcoins from that account, whereas the public key only lets you receive bitcoins to that account. You can physically separate the two keys to protect yourself from forced robbery while you're working. The Mycelium wallet does have a feature called "watch-only addresses," which means you can only receive payments to an address and watch its balance but cannot send bitcoins from it. That's what you could use. You would have the private key on another device, like your computer, at home.

Git actually works very similarly to Bitcoin. The changes to the source code are like Bitcoin transactions, and they are batched into commits, which are like Bitcoin blocks. The commits are chained together, with each commit incorporating the hash of a previous commit (or multiple previous commits in the case of a merge). Thus, the hash of any given commit incorporates the entire history of the code that led up to that commit, just like the hash of a Bitcoin block incorporates the entire transaction history all the way back to the beginning. Bitcoin is really Git for money rather than source code, plus a clever mechanism for automatically selecting which branch is the canonical one.

Well, I did read that actually, but I didn't understand that the `per_commitment_point` used in deriving `remotepubkey` is not the remote node's `per_commitment_point`. Intuitively I would have expected both the `basepoint` and the `per_commitment_point` in each `pubkey` derivation to be respective to the node for which that `pubkey` is derived. It seems counter-intuitive to use the `basepoint` of one node but the `per_commitment_point` of the other node.

No, Bitcoin is not recession-proof. No asset is.
Recessions happen because too many long-term, capital-intensive projects are started using funds borrowed at artificially low interest rates, and then it is discovered that the supply of real resources needed to complete those projects is inadequate, so some of the projects must be abandoned. The resulting debts must be paid back by liquidating investments, which causes prices throughout the economy to fall. Bitcoins will be sold off to pay off debts, just as other commodities like gold and silver are.

In case you really don't know, I'll explain. Miners are only hashing the block header, filling in a different number in the "nonce" field for each hash. When they've exhausted all possible "nonce" values in the block header, they do increment the "extra nonce" field in the coinbase transaction and rehash a branch of the Merkle tree, but this occurs so infrequently that the depth of the tree really doesn't matter. So there's no significant relationship between the number of transactions in the block and the amount of work required to test a hash. The real reason why a miner might want to mine empty blocks is that empty blocks propagate across the network faster, thus giving other miners less of a chance to find a competing block before the entire network learns of the empty block.

You do realize that Bitcoin has a 10-minute average block interval for good reasons, right? It's not as though Satoshi made a mistake and picked too long an interval. The alts that use shorter block intervals have higher orphan rates, meaning that 1 confirmation on a chain with 1-minute blocks actually gives *less* than 1/10th the assurance of 1 confirmation on a chain with 10-minute blocks. And block interval is essentially irrelevant anyway since cryptocurrency has always been destined to be traded mostly off-chain. Zero-confirmation transactions have never been suitable for anyone to accept. (If they were, we wouldn't need a blockchain!)

Not quite zero. The equilibrium is where the profit from mining is no better than the profit from any other industry that has reached equilibrium. You can verify this for yourself using common sense: an entrepreneur will not stay in a venture that yields negligible returns, even though those returns may be positive. Bitcoin mining operations will shut down before their profit reaches zero. I would guess that equilibrium will be more like 2-3% profit, which is typical of any mature industry.

That's not necessarily true. When the payee generates an invoice, they can include routing hints that expose their unpublished channels, meaning any payer could route a payment using one of the payee's unpublished channels as the last hop.
By the way, I definitely agree with using "unpublished" rather than "private" to describe channels that are not announced to the gossip network. The term "private" falsely implies that only the parties on either end of the channel may use it, whereas in fact anyone who knows of the existence of the channel may route a payment over it.

That might be the case, but the "dominance" metric doesn't tell us anything about that. All it says is that if every cryptocoin could be exchanged into fiat at that coin's last traded price, then Bitcoin would garner 71% of the fiat. But of course that would be impossible. Many alts may be so weak that their price would crash to zero before even a tiny fraction of their outstanding supply could be liquidated. In reality Bitcoin likely is much more dominant than 71%, but we have no way of measuring that.

If the money funding the basic incomes is being printed, then this leads to massive inflation. Anyone with any amount of personal wealth and half a brain will not store their wealth in the form of the currency being used for basic incomes. This essentially creates a caste system, where the poor use the basic-income currency and the wealthy use other currencies with lower inflation rates (after spending their free funny money). With only the poorest people using the plebian money, it will become marginalized and lose standing in the global marketplace.
If, instead, the money funding the basic incomes is being collected by taxation, then this leads to massive expatriation, as wealthy people won't stick around to have their property confiscated at rates much higher than in comparable other countries. The tax base withers, and eventually the government resorts to printing. (See first paragraph.)

I wouldn't recommend it if it were custodial. It's completely noncustodial. Runs a port of lnd locally. The company automatically opens a channel to you when you first start it up. Channels are all hidden from the user, though there is a Developer interface that lets you issue commands directly to the lnd instance under the hood. Unlike most Lightning wallet apps, Breez is *only* a Lightning wallet; it has no on-chain wallet. You can deposit to it either by receiving on Lightning or by sending bitcoins to an address on-chain, which triggers a submarine swap into the Lightning wallet. You can also withdraw from the wallet to an on-chain address through a submarine swap. Very impressive implementation, all completely trustless.

Legal tender laws do need to be abolished, but they're not standing in the way of alternative currencies.

Okay, you're right, in the context of traditional, Wall Street stock brokerages. But OkCoin is not dealing with customers whom they can easily ruin if the customer doesn't cover their leveraged position. A margin call means something different for a gray-market exchange like OkCoin. Since we're talking about OkCoin in this thread, I'm talking about what happens when OkCoin issues a margin call.


Doesn't OkCoin do that? For instance, to buy bitcoins long on margin, you have to put up, say, 10% of the fiat needed to buy the coins, and then you are prohibited from withdrawing the coins that you've bought until you close your margin position, either by depositing the other 90% fiat or by selling enough of the coins to cover the position. If the market price moves down to a point where selling all of your coins would just cover the 90%, then OkCoin will automatically do it for you, and you lose your initial 10% fiat stake. What do you call this action if not a "margin call"?

Multi-sig escrow only costs money in the event of a dispute that needs to be arbitrated. In the usual case of agreement between the buyer and the seller, the escrow is free because only the buyer and the seller are involved in it.


That's not even possible with multi-sig escrow, as neither the buyer nor the seller would sign a transaction granting all of the funds to the escrow agent.


The whole point of escrow is that the merchant doesn't have to "hope" for anything from the buyer. If the buyer doesn't release the funds, then the merchant will ask the escrow agent to step in and arbitrate. The merchant only has to "hope" that the escrow agent is trustworthy, but the merchant should only be agreeing to use an escrow agent that is trustworthy in the first place.

It would be easy to do it if I used the naïve algorithm:
“For each input roll, multiply the key accumulator by the base of the input (the number of sides on the input die) and then add the value of the roll (minus one) to the key acculumator.” (The key accumulator initially contains zero.)
The complication is that I don't use the naïve algorithm for building up the key from the die rolls. For dice with a number of sides that is not a power of 2, the bits of entropy contributed by each roll does not divide evenly into 256 bits. For instance, a 6-sided die contributes ~2.58496 bits of entropy per roll. Therefore, 99 rolls is not enough, but 100 rolls is too many. Taking 100 rolls of a 6-sided die means that it may be possible to generate a key that is larger than *n*, the cyclic order of the generator point on the secp256k1 curve. The correct thing to do when generating a private key randomly is to throw away any generated key that is equal to or greater than *n* and generate another. (You don't simply compute the remainder because then you introduce a slight bias favoring lesser key values.) In order to save the user from doing 100 rolls only to find out that they'll have to do 100 more, I build up the key from the "high end" rather than from the low end. This allows the process to fail early, and the user is prompted to start over after only a very small number of rolls (usually one). The downside is that this requires the base of every roll to be known in advance. It would be possible to use heterogeneous dice with this algorithm, but it would require inputting the dice rolls in a regular and predictable pattern.

If that were true, you'd be right: the hoarder's coins are already permanently out of circulation anyway, so the hoarder's death doesn't change anything. But this is an incorrect assumption. Bitcoins have no use other than as money, so there's no reason to hoard them other than to sell/trade them later. Every hoarder has a price at which he/she will sell. However, if a hoarder dies with the key, then those bitcoins will *never* be sold *at any price*, and that is a materially different situation for the market.

A concession by the Bitcoin Core devs. People were stashing arbitrary data in the block chain, embedded in bogus output addresses. This practice permanently bloats the UTXO set, which is bad for all users of Bitcoin. Since there's no way to stop people from dumping their data into the block chain, the devs gave them a way to do it without bloating the UTXO set. That way is OP_RETURN.

Indeed. This is a huge point that a lot of people miss. Bitcoin is perhaps the very first commodity with a perfectly inelastic *supply*. All other commodities respond to changes in price with changes in rate of production. Price of gold goes up; more mines become economical to operate; more gold enters the market. Price of gold falls; some mines become uneconomical to operate and so shut down; less gold enters the market. Bitcoin doesn't work like this. Price of Bitcoin goes down; some mining operations become uneconomical and shut down; rate of Bitcoin production remains constant. Unlike most market forces, which are self-correcting (in a negative feedback loop), Bitcoin's price lacks this feedback mechanism. This means the rate of production continues unabated when price is low, thus continuing to drive the price down hard. It also means the rate of production continues without increase when the price is high, which means there is no rush of new supply to moderate the price. Quite a strange and new behavior for a commodity. Economists will have to write some new textbooks.

Are you ignoring all the people who opposed the hard fork on principled (rather than political) grounds?

That analogy is completely wrong. Are you forced to ride in a taxi for certain kinds of trips (like you're forced to accept legal tender for certain kinds of transactions)? Are merchants prohibited from accepting Bitcoin in certain areas (like drivers are prohibited from operating for Uber in certain areas)?
I suspect this comes down to a misunderstanding of "legal tender." Legal tender does not mean all other tenders are illegal, and it does not mean that legal tender must be accepted in all transactions. If I run a store selling widgets and you come in and want to buy a widget with your legal tender, I can refuse to accept it, and there's nothing illegal about that. (Legal tender laws only come into play when there's a debt obligation, created by a debt agreement, such as a promissory note.)

I find that there are a lot of zero- and one-step thinkers out there. To them, money comes from their employer, or maybe from the government ultimately if they're really thinking about it. But what money actually *is* doesn't seem to enter into public discourse. That each unit of currency represents a slice of the entire economy's deferred consumption is so far beyond the typical person's willingness to contemplate. In their estimation, doubling the money supply overnight and handing out all the new money to "the 99%" would trigger an economic boom and an extreme rise in their quality of life. They don't understand all the higher-order consequences of such a move. I suppose "rational ignorance" is at work here: knowing how monetary policy and macroeconomics interact would not help the typical person in any way, so the rational choice is to remain ignorant on the subject.

Mining carries with it a certain cost. This cost can be paid by transaction fees or block subsidies or some combination of the two.
* Subsidies mean that everyone who owns bitcoins pays for mining in proportion to their stake. (This basically amounts to a property tax — or more specifically, it's an "inflation tax.")
* Transaction fees mean that only the people who are actively using Bitcoin pay for mining, and they do so in proportion to the amount of blockchain space they consume.

Technically the dissenters *can* do something about it: they can hard fork to invalidate the soft fork. As an example, if the BU folks don't like the SegWit soft fork, then they can mine a block that spends a SegWit output as though it were ordinary "anyone-can-spend" output. (The nodes running SegWit SF will reject this block as invalid.) Then the BU folks can hard-code their new block as a checkpoint, to force their nodes to reject the longer BU chain.
In short: the mechanism that allows for democratic disapproval of a soft fork is a hard fork that undoes the rule change introduced by the soft fork.

Correct. And storage is not really a problem. Roger Ver is completely correct that one can buy a multi-terabyte hard drive that will store the blockchain, even one with bigger blocks, for years to come, for a fairly negligible sum of money.
The problem is network bandwidth. We simply cannot have every node in the network observing every transaction in the network (whether the nodes store all those transactions forever or not). The total network bandwidth utilization in that model scales as the *square* of the number of nodes in the network. That kind of growth is not sustainable, as total network capacity grows only linearly.

If I wanted to explicitly sell small amounts of Bitcoin and load the dollars onto a prepaid debit card, I'd do exactly what I do now: sell small amounts of Bitcoin and deposit the USD into my checking account. There's no point in a Bitcoin debit card for me in that case, and in fact any Bitcoin debit card would just cost me more in fees than what I'm doing now.
My reason for wanting a Bitcoin debit card that only sells bitcoins on the spot as needed to fund purchases is mostly philosophical: I want not to be a hodler of USD. (I also want not to be a transactor of USD, but that's a lot more difficult to accomplish just yet.)
I do recognize the security risk in giving a card issuer custody of some of my bitcoins. I certainly wouldn't keep much of a balance on the card.

Your core argument is definitely solid. I was just picking at the edges where you went off on a tangent.
In addition to taxation, legal tender laws also generate demand for the state's currency. Offering dollars is the only way I can *force* a lender to accept my repayment of a debt obligation. (If the lender doesn't accept my legal tender, then I can have a judge discharge my debt obligation.) No other currency will do that.

This guarantees that the returned set of coins sums to either exactly the target value or at least the target value plus the dust threshold.

The code could be ported to run on a TI-83, particularly on the newer TI-83 models that have much more RAM than the original one had. However, the TI-83 uses a Z80 processor, and TIGCC does not generate code for that processor, so you would need to find a C compiler that targets the Z80. The algorithms would run very much slower on a TI-83, too, since the Z80 is an 8-bit processor, whereas the 68000 is a 32-bit processor.

You can't assert that with perfect certainty. A hard fork could change Bitcoin in such a way that existing hardware would no longer work on the new chain. Possibly a firmware update could fix it, but it's also possible that Bitcoin could change so significantly that the hardware in the Trezor simply couldn't implement the new standards. The point is, we don't know, so we can't say that Trezor would definitely work after any hard fork.

But if we're not going through contortions to define Bitcoin as a new type of digital signature scheme, then you're incorrect: an EC public key cannot be extracted from an ECDSA signature. The public key must be communicated alongside the signature. (Bitcoin apps do this when you sign a message.)

Each time someone wants to change something about how Bitcoin works, if a lot of other people agree with them, then they get to pick one "bit" (out of 29 total bits) to represent their change. Each miner then can show support for the change by setting (turning on) the bit in the blocks they mine. The original SegWit (bit 1) needs 95% of blocks to show support for it before it can activate. The new SegWit (bit 4) needs only 80% of blocks. The new SegWit is (as far as I know) exactly the same as the old SegWit except for this needed support level.

I may be privy to more recent information than you. The decentralized search definitely works.


True and good, but does it support multi-sig escrow and mediation? OpenBazaar does.


Nodes (stores) don't need to be reachable via established domain names, so they can move around to different servers and cannot be censored from the global directory (as a domain registrar can do to a web site).


Yes. OpenBazaar's goals aren't identical to Bitcoin's. You can't have stores being replicated to other nodes because then those other nodes might unwittingly be engaging in criminal activities (e.g., materially aiding terrorists). For reasons that should be clear to anyone versed in statist logic, each store's content must be hosted only by that particular store.

The weird thing that I don't get about Bitmain's motivations is that the UASF — and even a full-on SegWit activation — won't force Bitmain to stop using covert ASICBoost. They just can't use covert ASICBoost on any blocks they mine that include SegWit transactions. Even after SegWit activates, miners still don't have to mine blocks that include SegWit transactions, so covert ASICBoost will still be in play.

You're right in the long run, but you're overlooking that the difficulty won't adjust downward right away. Those who continue mining after the halving won't suddenly be solving more blocks due to so many miners having shut down. Rather, any given miner's hash rate will still translate to the same block solving rate after the halving as before it, until the next difficulty adjustment.

What makes you think that a node can tell which transaction is the "original" and which is the "double-spend"? Do you think that receiving a transaction first automatically makes it the "correct" transaction, and that a transaction received second is necessarily a "double-spend"? This is not so. Nodes can receive transactions in any order and in fact different nodes receive transactions in different orders. (This is fundamentally why we need the block chain in the first place.)

Of course you're correct about that, but that's not representative of Bitcoin's future steady state at full deployment. A simple fact of economics is that human want is infinite. Try to think in the long run.


That's an extreme statement, on both points! A 100-MB block-size limit would guarantee that no individuals could run full nodes anymore. It would put Bitcoin soundly in the province of large corporations with well-connected data centers and petabytes of online, random-access storage. That's not what I want for Bitcoin, as that would be way too easy for governments to extort, manipulate, and ultimately destroy.
There is no chance that blocks would be only 2 MB if the limit were 100 MB. What miner would turn down an incremental increase in revenue from including one more transaction? It's in the miners' best interest to maximize their profits. Profit is revenues minus expenses. As long as adding one more transaction to a block brings in more revenue (from the transaction fee) than it costs the miner to verify and store it, the miner will do it. In the absence of any back pressure, transaction fees would fall to the point where they are just barely profitable for miners. At that very low fee level, the block chain would be a very attractive backup solution for many large industries. In short, blocks would definitely contain more than 2 MB of data.


Why would a larger block mean less revenue for a miner? Every additional transaction means additional revenue. It also means additional expense, not only in the form of validating and storing but also due to increased risk of losing the race to distribute a found block. However, the price point at which the revenue just exceeds the expense is very, very low — low enough to make the block chain attractive for bulk data storage, as I mentioned above.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:06:51
When the subsidy halving occurs, mining revenue will instantaneously be cut by about half. However, miners' expenses will be unaffected. Therefore, practically no miner will be profitable immediately after the halving. Eventually the difficulty will adjust downward and the bitcoin price will probably adjust upward, but this could take many months, during which Bitcoin's usability will be impaired due to lengthy confirmation times and a large transaction backlog.

"That which can be destroyed by the truth, should be." The truth is that zero-confirmation transactions are not reliable and never have been. Indeed, that's the entire reason why the block chain had to be invented. (If zero-conf transactions *were* reliable, then we wouldn't need a block chain in the first place, as each node could simply accept transactions in the order it observes them. The truth, of course, is that not all nodes observe transactions in the same order, so we need a block chain to establish an agreed-upon overall ordering of transactions.) Given that the mempool is *unordered*, then the choice of which of a set of conflicting transactions should be relayed and mined is arbitrary and subjective. Thus, "relay the transaction having the highest fee density" is just as good a policy as "relay only the first observed of each set of conflicting transactions."
Bitcoin *can be* better than credit cards for retail point-of-sale transactions, but single-signer Bitcoin transactions can't be. Making zero-confirmation transactions reliable requires an additional layer. (One possible solution is third-party cosigners whom merchants trust never to sign a conflicting transaction.)
There is a fundamental problem with how some people are using Bitcoin, and you are preferring to ignore the problem and to shoot down attempts at pointing out that the problem exists. The problem can be solved, but pretending it does not exist is not a solution.

The Bitcoin network will always be "congested" in the sense that blocks will always be filled, no matter how large they're allowed to be. Raising the size limit would only result in users' stuffing that much more data into the blockchain. Fundamentally there is no limit to the world's appetite for massively redundant, immutable data storage. The only force keeping consumption in check is the block-size limit. Raise the limit, and consumption will rise to meet it, like a gas expanding to fill whatever container it's placed in.

The situation may be a little more subtle than you might expect. At the point of the fork, it's true that your existing coins will then exist on both sides the fork, but there will actually be *three* flavors of coins to consider, not two. Initially, all your coins will be of the type that is valid on both chains. Thereafter, whenever you send a transaction using only that type of coin as input, you will have a chance that the outputs will be of the same type (valid on both sides), but you will also have a chance that the outputs will be of one of the other two types (valid on only one side or the other). You can force the type of the output by using an input coin that is valid on only one side of the fork, but if all your coins are valid on both sides, then you're at the mercy of chance as to which type of output you get (which depends on whether your transaction confirms on one side of the fork or the other or both).

MAST does reduce transaction size, though.

Of course, if you're in the extreme minority, then you'll probably be left behind, but if a significant number of other people hold out with you, then you can keep the old policy alive.
If BIP101 forks the chain, 25% of the mining power at that time will still be mining using the original rules, so it's entirely possible that we'll end up with Bitcoin Classic and Gavincoin both surviving for a time.

What's a "non-RBF transaction"? **Any** transaction can be replaced before it is mined into a block, if a miner is willing to do so. (And they will be willing if it's made profitable enough for them.) This idea of using the nSequence field to denote transactions which are "allowed" to be replaced is being misunderstood by the general public. It only affects transaction relaying and mining by nodes *that choose to opt in* to the proposed nSequence convention. It cannot be a consensus rule^(†), and thus it cannot be relied upon to always be enforced. There will always be the possibility that a nefarious customer can send a replacement transaction directly to a mining pool, bypassing any relay policy such as the proposed nSequence policy.

Bitcoin was designed so that spamming the blockchain would be expensive. This implies that "legitimate" uses need to pay a higher fee rate than spam.

As a software developer who has written an SPV Bitcoin daemon in C++ from scratch (for my [Bitcoin-enabled snack vending machine]( I will admit that I was against SegWit because I believed it to be "a solution in search of a problem." I was unaware of the many ways in which transactions remain malleable, even after the imposition of the DER and low-*s* requirements. Moreover, Greg really does have a good point in that the difference between putting the signatures in the `scriptSig` field of the transaction (and skipping over them when hashing the transaction) and putting them outside the transaction is really only a matter of serialization format, which node implementations are already free to implement however they wish anyway, so long as they speak the canonical protocol on the wire (unless negotiated otherwise) and use the canonical format when computing transaction hashes. And as for my belief that SegWit is primarily a ploy to sate the "Big Blockists" for a while, in actuality the effective increase in on-chain capacity is really more of an implementation artifact.

I don't have a source for that definition; it's just my intuition of what makes for a commodity. For example, iPhones are fungible in that each (factory-new) iPhone is interchangeable with every other (factory-new) iPhone, but iPhones are not a commodity. So clearly fungibility is a necessary but insufficient condition for commodities. What other qualities are necessary for something to be a commodity? As I see it, it must be possible for anyone to produce the thing and sell it interchangeably on the market with the same things produced by others. For example, oranges are a commodity because I can sell the oranges from my grove right alongside the oranges from your grove, and — crucially — no one can invoke the legal system to enjoin me from growing oranges. (If I tried to manufacture iPhones, Apple would slap a lawsuit on me before I could blink.) But, I can manufacture PC motherboards, and they are often referred to as "commodity hardware" because, for the most part, boards produced by one producer are interchangeable with boards produced by another producer, and — crucially — anyone can enter the market and manufacture PC motherboards, assuming they have the right capital.

My favorite solution for 0-conf transactions is the "mutually trusted co-signer" solution: you load some bitcoins into an address that requires your signature plus that of a public and trusted third party in order to spend from it. The third party cannot spend your bitcoins by itself, but it can be trusted not to co-sign any transaction that is a double spend. Thus, a merchant wanting to accept 0-conf transactions need only check that a trusted third party has co-signed.

You need to look into "payment channels." It sounds like you're wanting to publish transactions frequently, and that is a very inefficient (and arguably abusive) way to implement it. Payment channels allow a payer and a payee to exchange a continuous series of messages that guarantee that the payee will be able to extract the correct amount from the payer at whatever point their contact is terminated (even abruptly).

Fractional-reserve banking only works because "one dollar" and "one promise to pay one dollar" are equivalent. Dollars are debt-based currency.

The entire reason the block chain was invented was to solve the distributed consensus problem, and this was accomplished by proof of work. Without mining, there is no proof of work, and there can be no distributed consensus, as there is no cost to producing competing chains.

Thanks for the link. That's one I'd never seen. I do wonder, though, whether they're actually trading *futures* or if they're really trading standard options contracts. A future doesn't give the contract holder any option of whether to complete the transaction; the contract holder's only choice is to complete the transaction or sell the contract back to the issuer. If the contract holder doesn't sell the contract back, then he must take delivery of the contracted commodity. Since taking delivery usually has high costs (bitcoin being the notable exception), it is very common for futures contract holders to "roll forward" their contracts (selling the near-term contract and buying a longer-term contract). This creates a large amount of "float": quantities of the commodity that exist on paper but never actually need to materialize. This is how big banks manipulate (i.e., artificially suppress) the price of commodities like silver.
A standard *options* contract, on the other hand, gives the contract holder the option to execute the transaction or not. Typically this is the type of contract that is written for stocks. Bitcoin is a strange animal that is something between a commodity and a stock. I would expect miners to sell futures contracts, but I would expect traders to write options contracts.

All of these requirements squeeze out small businesses to the benefit of large corporations that can absorb the associated costs.


All of these regulations are redundant. If someone is polluting your property, you have a legal cause of action against them because they are causing you damages.


If an employer is willfully excluding qualified workers from consideration, then the employer is only hurting him/herself, as he/she will have a smaller labor supply to pull from and will thus likely have to pay more.


If you had a condition that existed prior to your contact and you didn't disclose it, then you acted fraudulently. And if you did disclose it and an insurer refused to offer you a contract, then you either offer a higher price or you don't get the contract. You don't have a moral right to force anyone to contract with you.

Evidently I have to give an example of a straightforward fix to a long-standing problem in Bitcoin that SegWit fixes in a less-than-straightforward manner.
I starting writing a (still incomplete) [BIP]( when BU was credibly on the verge of splitting the blockchain. I stopped when BU self-destructed. This BIP was to be the first of several BIPs aimed at fixing long-standing shortcomings in Bitcoin in straightforward ways. I expect that such straightforward fixes would always require hard forks, as soft forks are — almost by definition — less than straightforward. However, if a fix is simple enough, then achieving the necessary community support to implement it as a hard fork should not be so difficult. We have seen previous hard-fork proposals fail because they were too controversial. A simple fix to a long-standing problem, especially one that does not change *economic* parameters, is not controversial.

To address point  there has not yet been significant profit motive for miners to adopt RBF, as the block subsidy still utterly dwarfs transaction fees. It is reasonable to expect that miners may adopt RBF when transaction fees eventually become a significant proportion of their income.


This isn't true. A merchant might not be able to observe any conflicting transactions, yet a miner may mine an alternative transaction rather than the one that the merchant observed. Accepting zero-conf transactions is inherently unsafe and always has been.


It's not so much about reducing the utility of Bitcoin as it is about getting people to wake up and realize that zero-conf transactions cannot be relied upon. Accepting zero-conf transactions is comparable to the early days of the Internet, when people logged into servers by sending their passwords in the clear. Sending your password in the clear was never secure, but when the Internet first started out, it didn't pose much of a problem. But inevitably, as the Internet grew, the inherent insecurity of cleartext password transmission became apparent. The inherent unreliability of accepting zero-conf transactions will become apparent in time, as well. The push for full RBF is a push to make this "in time" happen sooner rather than later. Then we can work together to find solutions that allow Bitcoin to be usable in retail point-of-sale settings (such as mutually trusted cosigners).

The miners that signal for BU/EC aren't doing so because they approve of BU/EC; they're doing so because SegWit would kill their covert ASICBOOST advantage. As such, they will never actually signal for SegWit until they have no other choice (e.g., UASF succeeds).

Bundling a bunch of unrelated changes together is exactly what causes hard-fork proposals to fail to achieve the widespread support necessary to ensure safe activation.
We have a wonderful mechanism in [BIP 8]( to coordinate roll-out of protocol upgrades, and it works for hard forks as well as for soft forks. There's no good reason we have to batch up a whole bunch of unrelated fixes into a single activation. Let's fix Bitcoin incrementally by taking the "smallest bites" we can, but let's make those small bites really *clean*.

Gold certificates existed because gold is a royal pain in the ass to carry, authenticate, and subdivide. (In other words, gold, despite being a *pretty good* form of money, doesn't fare so well in the characteristics of portability, verifiability, and divisibility.) Bitcoin, on the other hand, excels supremely in these characteristics. Thus, there is little reason to expect there would be market demand for "bitcoin certificates."

1 kilobitcoin = 1000 bitcoins  
1 millibitcoin = 0.001 bitcoins  
1 microbitcoin = 0.000001 bitcoins
But if we then define "1 bit = 1 microbitcoin," then we have the following:
1 megabit = 1,000,000 bits = 1,000,000 microbitcoins = 1 bitcoin  
1 kilobit = 1000 bits = 1000 microbitcoins = 0.001 bitcoins  
1 bit = 1 microbitcoin = 0.000001 bitcoins  
1 millibit = 0.001 bits = 0.001 microbitcoins = 0.000000001 bitcoins (which doesn't exist)
So then we must reject "millibit" as an abbreviated form of "millibitcoin," as it is in fact a distinct quantity.
Also, this means that 1 kilobit = 1 millibitcoin. Rough.

The computations necessary to verify a block scale linearly with the number of transactions in the block. Number of transactions per block is expected to grow exponentially during the adoption phase of Bitcoin's life cycle. So yes, blocks in 100 years will take a *lot* more computing resources to verify than blocks today.
Edit: I suspect you were thinking of verifying the hash of the block, which is indeed a simple operation that is independent of the size of the block. But that is only part of verifying a block. A full node will not accept a block into its main chain without also verifying all the transactions inside it.

They don't need a block chain for that. In fact, a block chain is a rather inefficient data structure for that purpose.

In the Open Assets Protocol at least, the amount of colored coins transacted in a transaction is independent from the amount of bitcoins transacted. In other words, the "added value" is completely distinct from the bitcoins paid to publish the transaction to the block chain. So a "dust" amount of bitcoins really still only represents a dust amount of bitcoins; it's not like it's tied in proportion to a certain amount of the secondary asset.


This is a much stronger argument, though it really only argues that the dust threshold should be dynamic rather than hard-coded. It's the same argument as for mining fees, which are still mostly hardcoded, although some work is being done to enable paying fees relative to one's time preference.

I know it's possible to implement it such that the total number of coins will be the same. However, all of your suggestions would mean lower payouts for the miners immediately. Therefore, they will not be acceptable to miners. Miners have made critical business decisions with the expectation of a 25-XBT subsidy in every block until block 420,000. Any proposed change toward a smoothly declining subsidy that reduces the number of coins to be awarded between now and block 420,000 will be rejected by the miners.

Although I support UASF SegWit and am signaling on my full node presently (and do intend to upgrade to enforcing before August 1st), I must regretfully point out that neither this UASF nor Bitcoin Unlimited implement any provisions whatsoever to ensure a safe chain split. By this, I mean that, after the split, any legacy (i.e., non-SegWit) transaction spending only outputs that are valid on both sides of the fork will be unable to restrict its outputs to any specific side(s) of the fork. In other words, from the instant of the fork, all of your bitcoins will exist in both chains, but you will be unable to select the chain on which you wish to spend them. There will be a chance that your legacy payment will confirm on the legacy side of the split only, on the UASF SegWit side of the split only, or on both sides, and you won't be able to control this. This will cause an extremely poor user experience for quite a time, and the resulting confusion will shatter market confidence. Bitcoin will recover eventually, but this UASF activation is going to be painful.

A proof-of-work block chain (such as Bitcoin's) does not merely provide irreversibility; it also provides conflict resolution: the chain demonstrating the most work wins. If adding a new block has essentially zero cost, then this most important function of the block chain doesn't work.
Imagine two banks that both want to transfer money out of an account at a third bank. There isn't enough money in the account for both of the transfers to succeed, but both of the transfers are submitted at about the same time, and there are competing/conflicting blocks containing these transactions. Both banks want to be the one to be granted the transfer. How is this conflict resolved without an intermediary? Whoops, that's exactly the situation that Bitcoin was designed to avoid, but banks with their "private block chains" have fallen right back into that trap. Blockchain without proof-of-work isn't actually a consensus system. They'll discover this truth eventually but probably not before wasting a bunch of money.

Or Wright has the key for block 1 but no others. He could have used the `$signiture` "bug" to fake ownership of the key for block 9, which is almost certainly Satoshi's block, and then used the real key for block 1, which may not even belong to Satoshi, to prove ownership to Gavin. I have no idea how Wright got hold of the key for block 1, but mere ownership of this one key doesn't prove that he's Satoshi.
I would guess that Wright won't publish a signature using the block-1 key because this would only invite requests that he sign messages using the keys for other blocks, which he won't be able to do.

That's a plain old option, like options contracts on stocks. And the reason those cannot be used to manipulate the bitcoin market is that there is no cost in accepting delivery of bitcoins, so there is no reason to roll forward a contract in lieu of taking delivery. Bitcoin is unique in that it is a commodity with zero marginal transportation and storage costs, so the typical cost dynamics that enable big banks to manipulate other commodities markets via naked short selling don't work on bitcoin.

The typical escrow configuration is a 2-of-3 multi-signature. In the case where the buyer and seller agree that the sale was satisfactory, the buyer and seller sign to release the funds to the seller. In the case where the buyer refuses to cooperate, the seller and the escrow agent can release the funds to the seller. In no case can the buyer, the seller, or the escrow agent release the funds by acting alone.

Analyses of probabilistic versus deterministic algorithms assume that the machine on which the algorithm is running is deterministic. Otherwise, you would be correct: every algorithm running on a probabilistic machine is probabilistic. (This is the reality we face in quantum computing.)
As for your second point, there is no requirement that a deterministic algorithm execute in any bounded period of time. Indeed, a deterministic algorithm may execute indefinitely. What makes it deterministic is that the output is wholly determined by the input. How long it takes to produce the output is irrelevant to the discussion of whether it is deterministic.

That's the argument I was expecting, but it's an ignorant one. Merely increasing a parameter does not magically make the system scale.

The mempool is unordered. If each and every node could know the order in which transactions in the mempool were published, then we wouldn't need a block chain or mining. The whole reason we do need a block chain is because there's otherwise no way to order transactions with respect to one another. Point is, a node really has no way of knowing which of two (or more) conflicting transactions was "first." It can choose to accept only the first that *it saw*, but that's not necessarily the first that was published. Since the choice is essentially arbitrary anyway, it makes sense to pick whichever transaction is most profitable (pays the highest fee per byte).
So-called "opt-in" RBF is an illusion. Miners have absolute control over which transactions they place into their blocks. There's nothing preventing them from replacing a transaction that isn't flagged as "replaceable." Peter Todd's proposal is really just a change in relay policy. And even that isn't a consensus rule. I'm still free to run my node with "full RBF" relay rules, and I will continue to do so.

When anyone is paying me, I'll demand that they pay me with bitcoins that are valid on the BIP148 side of the split. This effectively means I'll have withdrawn my economic demand from the legacy side. If enough people do this, the legacy coins will acquire a lower market value than the BIP148 coins, and then it will be in miners' self-interests to switch to mining on the BIP148 chain (which requires them to signal for SegWit but does not commit them to actually processing SegWit transactions even after SegWit activates).

But there is downward pressure created by users who opt for an "economical" fee — say, one that should get their transaction into the chain within 10 blocks with a 90% probability.

They don't actually lend out any of the money you put on deposit. Rather, your money on deposit allows them to create entirely new money to lend out. The act of a bank lending money actually causes new money to come into existence. This is something most people don't understand. The Federal Reserve (and other central banks) created only a tiny fraction of all the money that is now in existence. The vast majority (like 99%) of it was conjured into existence by commercial banks through the act of making loans. The banks are limited in how much new money they can create by the amount of money that has been deposited with them, but the money deposited with them can be (and usually is) money that another commercial bank created by making a loan, so this is how $1 of central-bank-printed money can turn into $99 of circulating money.

In Scenario 1, you can use any one of three allowed accounting methods for calculating your capital gain/loss:
* **First-In, First-Out:** You always sell your oldest bitcoins first. This will cause you to pay the most tax if your oldest bitcoins are also your cheapest bitcoins. Conversely, if you initially bought in when the Bitcoin price was at its peak, then this method will generate the greatest capital loss for you. (Note that there is a limit to the amount of capital loss you can claim in one year, but you can roll forward the remainder to subsequent years.) In your example, you would have sold 0.75 BTC of the 1 BTC you bought at $500. Your cost basis for that 0.75 BTC was $375, so selling it for $300 generated a $75 capital loss.
* **Average Cost Basis:** You always sell bitcoins from all of your lots, in proportion to the sizes of the lots. In your example, since you had acquired 3 BTC and then sold 0.75 BTC, you sold 25% of your total stake, so you sold 25% of the 1 BTC you bought at $500, 25% of the 1 BTC you bought at $200, and 25% of the 1 BTC you bought at $600. Your cost basis is 0.25*($500+$200+$600)=$325, so your sale generated a $25 capital loss. Note that you now have only 0.75 BTC remaining in each of your three lots.
* **Specific Identification:** You have to specify which lot(s) you sold. This method gives you the most flexibility in how you generate capital gain/loss. In your example, you might want to specify that you sold the 0.75 BTC from the 1 BTC that you had purchased at $600. Your cost basis for the 0.75 BTC would be $450, so selling it for $300 would generate a capital loss of $150.

These countries will have a LOT of catching up to do in terms of Internet infrastructure if you want them to be able to connect to the Bitcoin network in 5-10 years. Even with only 1-MiB blocks today, many residential nodes in first-world countries (mine included) are running dangerously close to monthly bandwidth caps. There's just no way that a node in Ghana will be able to transfer the 1000+ GB of monthly traffic needed to participate in the Bitcoin network with 8-MiB blocks. (And in 5 years, blocks may be even bigger than 8 MiB, further shutting out the third world.) I think those people are going to have to use Bitcoin only through centralized portals / wallet services. They're not going to be able to connect to the Bitcoin network directly.

You're correct, but a corollary is that a new technology that is less than 10x better than the legacy technology will almost never win. (Incidentally, this is why I don't invest in any altcoins.) So Bitcoin has to be at least 10x better than fiat to take over. Is it?

I am in complete agreement with you on all points.
* Renaming to Bitcoin "Core" was a misstep. It's fine to call it the "reference client" or the "Satoshi codebase."
* We need a standard specification. I want IETF RFCs for the Bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol and the Bitcoin consensus rules. The Core devs practically laugh at me and tell me that "the code is the specification." What a joke.
* We need multiple implementations of the one standard. How many people still run the original BitTorrent mainline client? Hardly anyone, because alternative implementations are way better. The same could/should happen for Bitcoin.
* Any project that aims to intentionally hard fork Bitcoin's block chain by introducing an incompatible change to the consensus rules is an *altcoin* and must not hold itself out to be "Bitcoin."
* In all previous, notable cases of a schism in an open-source project, the schism faction have changed the name of the software after forking. OpenOffice to LibreOffice, OpenSSL to LibreSSL, FFmpeg to LibAV, VirtualDub to VirtualDubMod, just to name a few. It's unprecedented that a schism faction would try to usurp the name of the original project.

More likely, Bitcoin would simply implement a new digital signature algorithm with a new type of address (beginning with a digit other than "1" or "3"), and everyone owning bitcoins would simply move their coins to a new QC-resistant address.
Of course, if you're following best practices and not reusing Bitcoin addresses, then you don't care much about quantum computing. The best known quantum algorithm ([Grover's algorithm]( still needs 2^79 attempts to crack RMD160, on average, which is way more than is feasible.

Every single block in the chain except for the genesis block has a parent, so no block (except the genesis block) is an orphan! I like to say "abandoned blocks" instead of "orphaned blocks," but sometimes I begrudgingly will say "orphan" just because it's what everyone else immediately understands.

Was the computer in fact not newly purchased but rather specially prepared and made to look as though the factory packaging had not previously been opened?

Hmm. If you short sell 100,000 BTC and crash the price, will you then be able to buy 100,000 BTC without boosting the price back to where it was?

That's no problem. If the current flock of miners don't create SegWit blocks, additional miners will come online to do it.

Nodes can't discard witness data if they want to be able to provide it to other nodes.

Almost all of that list is on the merchant side. Merchant adoption pushes the price *down* because it provides more ways for Bitcoin hodlers to sell their bitcoins. The rest of it is either investment in Bitcoin companies (which has no appreciable impact on the Bitcoin price), vaporware, or FUD.
It's going to take institutional money to shake Bitcoin out of this rut, and the only way institutional money can invest in Bitcoin is via an exchange-traded vehicle, of which there really aren't any yet.

Don't count your blocks before they are mined. Wait until after SegWit locks in before you assume it will actually be activating.

Buying a cup of coffee is not a transaction that needs to be recorded discretely in 100,000x redundancy worldwide for the rest of eternity.
The disaster here is that we were supposed to have trustless, decentralized ways of spending bitcoins off-chain by now, such that on-chain transactions really could be reserved just for bulk settlements.

That's only true if the replacement transaction reaches a miner that implements Replace-By-Fee.
It might be more reliable to attempt a Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction to incentivize a miner to include the first transaction to claim the fee on the second transaction.

If you send bitcoins to a SegWit address on the main chain using inputs that are valid on both chains, then an attacker (most likely a miner) on the Cash chain can immediately spend the output of your transaction on the Cash chain, as SegWit transactions appear as "anyone can spend" to non-SegWit software.

If miners don't change anything, then their blocks won't be accepted by BIP148 nodes, and their freshly minted bitcoins won't have value among the BIP148 user base.
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:02:39


You have it backwards. If everyone always spent all of their bitcoins immediately, then there would be no demand for bitcoins, and the price of bitcoins would be (near) zero. In contrast, if no one ever spent their bitcoins, then there would be very little supply of bitcoins (the only supply coming from mining), and so the price of bitcoins would be very high.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:22:32

Full RBF improves upon the convenience and practicality of Bitcoin by allowing you to optimize your use of block-chain space. Need to make a second payment before your first confirms? With RBF, you can replace your original transaction with one that has an additional output. Without RBF, you are forced to make a separate transaction, which consumes more space in the block chain and costs you more in fees. There are several other practical use cases for full RBF as well. And it's inevitable anyway, so we may as well not pretend that it will never happen. Let's rip the bandaid off now and figure out how to make retail point-of-sale Bitcoin transactions reliable.

All the brand-new chip-enabled POS terminals I've seen have no NFC interface. Only the older generation of terminals, which are now being replaced, had contactless interfaces.

(I've tapped my contactless Chase Visa card at merchants where the clerk never even knew that the pad at the top of the POS terminal was for interfacing with contactless payment cards.

This seems impossible. 100% reserves implies zero risk, so why would the bank pay you interest? Your bitcoins are useless to the bank if they must stay in reserve. If the bank has no use for your bitcoins, then it has no reason to pay you to keep your bitcoins on deposit there. This can only be a scam, or there's something they're not being forthcoming about, like maybe your coins aren't actually held in 100% reserve. I would demand continuous cryptographic proof of solvency, and even then I'd be highly suspicious about legal encumberances on the funds.

I wasn't defining short *selling*; I was giving one example of a short strategy, as opposed to a long strategy. If I think Bitcoin's price will head downward, the profitable thing to do will be to go short. I could borrow bitcoins and sell them to do this (a.k.a. "short selling"), or I could simply sell the bitcoins I already own free and clear. The latter strategy lacks leverage but is less risky.

This is why I own Bitcoin too, and it's why I am concerned about the proliferation of "altcoins." Bitcoin's limited supply means nothing if there can be an unlimited number of other cryptocurrencies.

Don't count your blocks before they are mined. BIP 91 may lock in, but that is by no means a guarantee that a majority of miners will go through with rejecting non-SegWit-signaling blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:37:00
BIP91's signaling on bit 4 has no enforceable bearing on BIP141's (SegWit's) signaling on bit 1, though. Do you honestly believe that the miners who are signaling on bit 4 now will start signaling on bit 1? Why wouldn't they *already* be signaling on bit 1 if they support SegWit?


Exactly right. So why has there been so much active blocking of SegWit if the miners could have activated SegWit at any time and then hard-forked to bigger blocks? What I'm trying to say is that BIP91 doesn't buy anything. SegWit and big blocks are two independent changes, and there's no way to force them to activate as a package deal. So why are suddenly all these miners okay with SegWit? Answer: they're not; rather, they are engaging in yet more stalling tactics.

Is a stock split the same as inflation? No, because the new units are instantly distributed to everyone who was holding the old units, pro rata. That's what would happen in a chain split too.
The real inflation is due to the altcoins, and that's what really bothers me about the cryptocurrency space. I've always believed that network effects would ultimately favor one cryptocurrency to the exclusion of all others, but that eventuality isn't seeming to materialize. If it doesn't, then the premise of cryptocurrency is kind of ruined for me, and I might have to switch back to precious metals.

The whole point of BIP91 is to head off the UASF so that miners can maintain some semblance of relevancy in Bitcoin governance. To that end, yes, BIP148 (UASF) nodes will accept exactly the same set of blocks accepted by BIP91 nodes. Or, stated another way, BIP148 nodes and BIP91 nodes, upon activation of their respective BIPs, will both reject the same set of blocks, namely those that do not signal for SegWit. The only real difference is that BIP91 activates by hash-power threshold while BIP148 activates at a specific time.

Forking to BU is not Jihan's (or Roger's) goal. The goal is to avoid losing the covert AsicBoost edge. All talk of block size and SegWit is a red herring.

True, though only UASF 1.0 nodes do this. I'm still running 0.3 because I don't trust large deviations from Core. I might need to hack it to turn on that service bit, though, or else all the UASF 1.0 nodes won't prefer to connect to me.

The author is severely overestimating the likelihood that users will switch to BTC1 and follow the hard fork later this year. After SegWit gets locked in (either by BIP148 or by BIP91), there will be no more need to make deals with the miners, and they can go fork themselves off the main chain if they want to (but they won't).
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:36:57
Enforcing. You can tell the difference because enforcing nodes contain the exact substring `/UASF-Segwit:` (the slash and colon are important) in their sub-version strings whereas merely signaling nodes do not.
Bitnodes is currently showing 569 [UASF-enforcing nodes]( out of 979 [UASF-signaling nodes](

As far as I know, the Bitcoin Core devs did not sign on to the "New York Agreement" a.k.a. "SegWit2x," and they presently have no plans to merge code for a hard fork.
BIP91 ("SegWit2x") and BIP148 ("SegWit-UASF") are not officially endorsed by the Bitcoin Core developers, though some of those developers may have personal opinions about these movements.
In general, whenever you find yourself thinking about a struggle in terms of "the good guys," you're probably not seeing the whole picture. My support is with Core because they are technically more competent than the other factions.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:32:38
SegWit fixes several longstanding deficiencies in Bitcoin's design, malleability among them. It's true that the increased transaction capacity is a happy side effect. I think Core made a mistake with the "witness discount" thing, as it gives the appearance that they had to sweeten the deal to get people to use SegWit, and that immediately causes the knee-jerk assumption that SegWit must be "bad" such that it needs sweetening to be palatable.

Possibly not. If the wallet thinks both transactions (original and malleated) are valid, then it may try to spend the coins from the one that isn't actually in the block chain, and of course that transaction will never confirm.

BitPay are in the "extension blocks" tribe, aren't they?
@_date: 2015-02-28 09:07:13
Not really. Creating a new transaction that spends the same coins but pays a much higher fee is great incentive for a miner to include the new transaction and discard the original transaction. The only difficulty is in getting the new transaction to the miners, as the P2P network will not propagate a double-spend transaction. But I'd expect the major mining pools eventually to expose APIs for direct submission of transactions. Eligius already has such an API.

The problem comes if one non-SegWit-signaling block is mined on top of another one.

This is supposed to be fixed, but it could still cause issues in the network if not all nodes have the fix.

I agree with everything you said except for the assumption that monopolies are inevitable. Monopolies could not persist indefinitely in a truly free market, as factions within the monopoly would always break off and go into competition with it. Monopolies *can* conceivably persist under a statist regime because there are enormous barriers to entry in the form of regulations, usually lobbied for by the monopolies themselves, such that there's no way for an internal faction to break off. (Of course, the Big Daddy monopoly tries to break up any smaller monopolies to help out the people, but it's never discussed that those smaller monopolies would never be stable without the Big Daddy monopoly preventing any competition from entering the market.)

Whoa there, you have it exactly backwards. BIP148 means nodes will reject blocks that do not signal for the plain old SegWit that's been around for many months.

Make no mistake: I'm not a "big blockist" or a BU supporter. I don't even really like the technical design of SegWit all that much.

Fixing transaction malleability will be a huge step in the right direction.

You know it's possible to signal a version bit without actually implementing the associated policy, right? Mining pools typically run heavily patched code. They could be signaling for BIP91 with no intention to mine blocks signaling for BIP141 and also no intention to shun blocks not signaling for BIP141. That's what I predict. The status quo will continue. Miners aren't afraid of BIP148, as they predict it will fizzle.

If the bearings in your drive have seized up, you might try the freezer trick: put the drive in a plastic zipper bag, sucking all the air out before sealing it, and place the bag in the freezer overnight.

False. Easy to see a counter-example. If 100% of current miners decided to go back to getting 50-BTC subsidy per block, they would have "miner consensus," but they would utterly fail to change Bitcoin's policy. All that would happen is that they'd fork themselves off onto an extremely secure but worthless chain, and other miners would flow onto the real Bitcoin chain to take the 12.5 BTC per block.

Core will raise the block-size limit at the last minute (when it looks like a renegade fork will take over) and not a moment sooner. This is because raising the limit will alleviate the sense of urgency to find a real solution. Just look at how many times the U.S. Congress has raised its debt limit. Kicking the can in the short term leads to no solution in the long term. Necessity is the mother of invention. As long as there's a little pain in Bitcoin, there is motivation to find a solution. Raising the block-size limit would have the effect that all the developers would go back to working on apps rather than trying to solve the scalability problem.

Nominal yield is what percentage of the bond's principal value is paid out in interest annually. It doesn't take into account the practical value of those payments. For instance, a $10,000 bond might pay $200 in interest annually, which would mean it has a 2% nominal yield, but if the value of a dollar is falling by 2% per year at the same time, then the bond holder is only breaking even *in real terms*. If the value of a dollar is falling by 5% per year, then a bond with a 2% nominal yield actually has a -3% real yield.

If you have exclusive control of the private keys guarding your bitcoins before a fork, then it's impossible for you to find yourself on the "wrong side" of the fork since, by definition, any coins that you owned before the fork you will own on both sides of the fork after the fork. You just need to be careful in how you *spend* and *receive* coins after the fork, lest you accidentally spend coins on both sides of the fork when you didn't mean to (a.k.a. "replay") or receive coins on only one side of the fork when you wanted to receive them on both.

The dust threshold exists because dust outputs can never be spent economically. (Redeeming dust as a transaction input costs more in fees, due to the bytes in the signature script, than the dust input is actually worth, so it's never economically rational to redeem the dust.) Thus, to avoid bloating the unspent transaction output (UTxO) set with dust, transactions are considered non-standard if they create dust outputs.

It's not laziness. Look up "rational ignorance" (or don't, if you want to be rationally ignorant). Basically, the cost of educating oneself about policy decisions quite often exceeds the benefit of being so educated, so a rational actor will prefer to be ignorant.

I could spend thousands of dollars to produce a precision-sculpted pile of manure, in the shape of a perfect cone with an error of less than 0.1%. Does this mean I'll be able to sell my perfect dung heap for thousands of dollars? Absolutely not.
In general, the amount of resources expended to produce a good has very little bearing on the market value of that good. Some people will buy something just because it's expensive. Diamonds are a good example of this. But usually people will only buy something if it is useful and scarce. You can expend tremendous resources to produce something useless, and that thing will have a value far less than what it cost to produce, perhaps even zero value or negative value (you have to pay someone to dispose of it).

1. Changing the block rate at this point is just not going to happen.
2. Even if we could change it, we shouldn't. Blocks may propagate relatively quickly now, in Bitcoin's formative years, but when a block is a gigabyte rather than a megabyte in size, one minute is not going to be enough time. Making the block interval shorter incentivizes miners to produce smaller blocks for fear that a large block will not propagate fast enough to beat some other miner to the punch. Smaller blocks mean higher transaction fees and less usefulness for all of us. Since 0-confirmation transactions are actually unsafe anyway, I would actually argue for *increasing* the block interval to something more like 1 hour, but again, changing the block interval is not on the table.

Speeding is a great example, although it's exceedingly difficult to acquire a *felony* charge for speeding. (You'd have to be going like 90 MPH through a school zone that's under construction with workers present.)
But yes, speeding is a great example. I was musing on this just a couple of days ago. Everyone on the highway (and I mean literally like 9 out of 10 vehicles) was going 70 MPH along a stretch of road governed by a 50-MPH speed limit. The cops don't typically pull people over for speeding when everyone is doing it, but the fact remains that *they can if they want to.* So if you simply look at them the wrong way, or express your displeasure at their existence by use of a hand signal, they will invoke their discretionary power to stomp on you. Technically, they can do it even if you're exceeding the posted speed limit by 1 MPH, which everyone does continuously. Literally every vehicle is breaking the law continuously, so the cops get to choose whom to screw at their pleasure.

I hope you're wrong about that because, if the RPi2 is good enough for a few years, then it means Bitcoin hasn't really caught on, despite all these rumblings from Wall Street.
Seriously, I ran a full node on an RPi1 last summer, and it was taking 1-2 minutes to verify each block. Blocks come every 10 minutes on average, so the RPi1 only had 5x-10x headroom. Assuming the RPi2 is five times faster (I think that's what I've read), then it would have 25x-50x headroom. If Bitcoin isn't seeing 50 times the transaction volume in another couple of years, I'll be extremely disappointed, especially since I'm not sure Bitcoin can survive the next subsidy halving without significantly greater transaction volumes.

Anyone can generate a private key. It takes just microseconds of CPU time, and you don't have to obtain anyone else's permission to do it. Once you have a private key, you can calculate the public key that goes with it. So no, there are no fees for this part of Bitcoin. The fees come into play when you want the rest of the network to propagate a transaction you've made and store it in the block chain.

Too true. I have been ranting about the need for blockchain sharding for the better part of a year now, but all anyone can talk about is "AXA Blockstream Core vs Jihad VerCoin."


The difficulty is that "drawing the line" is an incredibly slow procedure in Bitcoin, taking on the order of years to carry out. "Emergent Consensus" attempts to shortcut this process at the risk of fragmenting the network and splitting the chain. I wish there were a safer mechanism for tuning Bitcoin's trade-off variables, but all proposed mechanisms thus far have been vulnerable to gaming.


I said I don't believe Lightning will work as hoped, not that I don't support the attempt. There are other efforts, in the form of side chains and drive chains, though I haven't seen any really compelling proposals for how to make them interoperate trustlessly with Bitcoin's main chain. I think a more realistic scenario would be a "federated wallet protocol," which would allow hosted wallets to send off-chain payments to other hosted wallets (on different wallet services) instantly, with a large batch settlement between the wallet services occurring periodically. This idea is similar to Lightning but not quite as good, as there is counterparty risk. Plenty of people don't seem to mind the counterparty risk of holding their bitcoins on Coinbase, though, so I think this idea would be successful in the real world.


Yes, but "safely" is an extremely difficult criterion to pin down. Other coins will definitely be more aggressive in making this call. Bitcoin is seen as extremely conservative. Perhaps that will be its undoing.

Since your transaction never made it into the block chain, from the perspective of the software, it "never happened." Therefore, your coins haven't moved; they're still where they were. This means you can try again with a new transaction. However, your wallet may still be attempting to get your first transaction into the block chain (by periodically rebroadcasting it), meaning it won't let you spend it again. If your software is new enough (sounds like it isn't), then you could abort the first transaction, which would free up the coins for a second attempt. Alternatively, you can export the private key and import it into another wallet and make your second attempt from there. (The new wallet will have no knowledge that you had tried to spend the coins previously.)

To expound: if you are a merchant accepting bitcoins at a fixed address, then a mugger can wait in the shadows outside your store and watch your address for new transactions. Whenever the mugger sees a new payment from an address that holds a large balance, the mugger knows that the next customer to walk out of your store is carrying a lot of bitcoins and is a prime target for mugging.
For the safety of your customers, you should use a different address for each transaction.

Bitcoin wallets on Android have supported NFC for years. Tap your phone on the payment terminal, and your Bitcoin app will launch with the recipient's address and amount already filled in. Just tap Send.
It works through the Bitcoin URI scheme. The payment terminal presents via NFC a Bitcoin URI that includes the recipient's address and the requested amount (in BTC). The Android operating system in the phone broadcasts a URI intent, and if you have at least one app installed that handles Bitcoin URIs, then it'll launch and parse the recipient and amount out of the URI. If you have more than one capable app installed and haven't chosen a default, then you'll be asked which app to use.
The roadblock is that there really aren't any serious Bitcoin-enabled payment terminals anywhere.
Support on Apple devices is probably non-existent, but that's to be expected.

True, though unlike altcoins the Lightning Network has a very low switching cost. In particular there is no opportunity cost to use Lightning, as you're still in Bitcoin the whole time.


That's a specious argument. You have to "lock funds" to use any cryptocurrency system. If you're holding bitcoins, you can't be holding (as many) dogecoins, etc. In most practical scenarios you would never need to take your coins off of the Lightning Network. It's similar to how most people in developed countries rarely have a need to take cash out of the banking system; we mostly just leave our dollars, pounds, euros in the banks and make purchases electronically. So too will most people leave most of their bitcoins in the Lightning Network.


Definitely true.


I don't believe that will be necessary. Already there's a strong argument for preferring to be paid on LN rather than on chain, as the received funds are thereby cheaper to respend. When friends want to pay me in bitcoin, I make them throw in a little extra if they want to pay me on chain. That effect cumulatively will drive people toward Lightning eventually, even if Lightning isn't the default payment method in their wallets.

Not true when we're talking about currency. Absent the force of governments, there would be only one significant currency worldwide, with some negligible pockets of fanatical fad coins. Network effects just do not support multiple significant currencies in the long term. A currency with more users will always have more utility than a currency with fewer users, and thus the currency with fewer users will lose mindshare to the currency with more users and eventually fade into obscurity. This is what will happen to all "alts" once the novelty wears off. I do not want Bitcoin to become an "alt." (I'll admit this is because I'm invested fully in Bitcoin.)

How are you measuring the proportional economic contributions of the UASF-enforcing nodes relative to the non-UASF nodes?

You don't have to do anything in your wallet. Just turn your phone on and turn on the NFC radio. With your phone sitting at its home screen, tap your phone on the payment terminal. Your phone will either launch your wallet (if you have only one or have set a default) or ask you which wallet you want to launch.
The wallets don't need to do anything special for NFC, as they are not interacting with NFC. The Bitcoin URI is read via NFC by Android, and Android passes the URI to the wallet applications in exactly the same manner as though you had tapped on a Bitcoin payment button in your phone's web browser.

Unlike Y2K, which was much ado about nothing, the Y2K38 issue is going to affect a lot of software. Looks like Bitcoin may not be affected since it's purportedly using *unsigned* 32-bit integers to hold elapsed seconds since the Unix epoch, but a lot of software out there is still using *signed* 32-bit integers for the same, and that is a very real problem, not FUD.

::sigh:: I really didn't want to get into the code in this discussion, as it'll be a colossal waste of my time, but okay, I'll give some examples.
"Soft-fork trickery": In order to remain compatible with legacy software that does not understand (or see) the new "witness" data, SegWit constructs P2SH redeem scripts in such a manner that they appear to allow anyone in possession of the script to spend outputs sent to it. This is unintuitive and contrary to the design of the Script language, but it is necessary to enable deployment as a soft fork.
"Gunked up design": Soft-fork SegWit introduces a second transaction ID, the `wtxid`, which would be unnecessary if SegWit were implemented as a hard fork.
Both of these examples result from SegWit's addressing the transaction malleability bug in a backward-compatible way. If a hard fork had been acceptable to the designers of SegWit, then transaction malleability could have been solved without "segregating the witness data," as the fields over which the `txid` are computed could simply have been redefined to exclude the signature-containing input scripts. Likewise, the quadratic signature validation performance could have been fixed in a hard fork by redefining the behavior of the `OP_CHECKSIG` family of opcodes rather than by introducing a secondary scripting language.

Consider this math:
(7.5 billion people) × (2 transactions per day) × (250 bytes per transaction) / (86400 seconds per day) ≈ 43.4 megabytes per second
So a node would need a sustained 43.4 MB/s (347 Mbps) *symmetric* Internet connection just to keep up with the flow of transactions, not accounting for additional protocol overhead. This is doable in some very well-connected data centers with pricey gigabit Internet uplinks, but it's not realistic for hobbyists and small businesses.

That's only true if you want nominal prices to remain unchanged. I don't. I want prices to fall as the economy grows.

I really like this approach, though obviously it requires a hard fork, and the Core devs seem dead set against any hard forks whatsoever. Still, it could be written up as a BIP and a reference implementation coded.
The downside is that it places a rather touchy control knob between the fingers of people who really have no idea how to think about where they should set that knob. The majority of users are not technical enough to have an informed opinion about the block-size limit, and they will instruct their wallets to vote in whatever way requires the lowest transaction fees. Therefore, this game degenerates into miner control of the block-size limit, and that's a bad scenario, as it leads to the "One Miner Left Standing" end game.
"One Miner Left Standing" is the eventual outcome of allowing miners to control the block-size limit. In each iteration of the game, at least 51% of the mining hashpower will vote to raise the block-size limit above a threshold at which the least connected miner(s) will no longer be able to continue playing. Once that/those miner(s) drop out of the game, then the cycle repeats. Eventually only one miner remains, and the blocks are ginormous. Then a government zaps that miner, and goodbye Bitcoin.

There are patches for Bitcoin Core that cause the node to replace transactions already in its mempool with conflicting transactions that pay a higher fee rate, even if the transactions do not signal that they are "opt-in RBF-eligible." Point is, it's entirely the prerogative of each node to do this, as there is no way to enforce an ordering on unconfirmed transactions. (That's why we needed the block chain invention in the first place!) I've been running my full node with Luke-jr's "all transactions are eligible for replacement by fee" patch for years.

They don't, though, as most desktop browsers and wallets aren't set up to support the "bitcoin:" URI scheme, forcing users to fall back to copying the address to the clipboard and pasting it into their wallet.
The Payment Protocol has another advantage for users too, although I don't know if any wallets take advantage of the option: the wallet can supply a refund address when making the payment. This allows the payment processor to refund the money automatically in case of payment error.
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:26:16


The advantage is that the user is protected against clipboard-altering malware and rogue network proxies that substitute Bitcoin addresses on the fly. The wallet fetches the payment request from an HTTPS URL, and TLS ensures that the Bitcoin address contained in the request cannot be altered in transit.

If you ask Greg Maxwell or Luke-jr, they'll tell you this is nonsense and that the only difference in a hard-forked solution might be where the witness merkle tree root is located. I personally would rather have seen various fixes (e.g., malleability, quadratic signature checking) made as separately adoptable version-bits deployments of hard forks. Implementing these fixes as a soft fork causes the design to get gunked up. Anyone writing a new Bitcoin node implementation from scratch will curse the hoops they'll have to jump through to support the accumulated mass of soft-fork trickery.

Transaction malleability impacts any work flow that involves a funding transaction followed by a clearing transaction that spends the output of the funding transaction. One example is the [original envisioning of a cross-chain atomic swap by TierNolan]( which requires B to sign TX2, which spends the output of TX1, before TX1 is broadcast to the network. This has the problem that TX1 may be malleated, thereby invalidating TX2, and a dishonest B may refuse to sign a corrected TX2.

In my opinion, "bits" was a terrible term to coin, and I expressed my dissatisfaction with the term here in this subreddit when it was first surfacing. Imagine what happens to the units when you analyze a cost-per-bandwidth figure. If I sell bandwidth at a price of 30 microbits per megabyte, then isn't that the same as a price of 3.75×10^(-12) (a unitless quantity)?
[30×10^(-6) bits] / [1×10^6 bytes * (8 bits/byte)] = 3.75×10^(-12)
It's just weird.

It's actually pretty difficult to pick curve parameters that result in a high generator order. In order for ECC to be secure, the chosen curve and generator point need to define a group with a very high order. In plain English, that means that the number of times you need to add the generator point to itself to go "all the way around" the cycle and get back to the starting point needs to be very high. A randomly chosen curve and generator point are quite likely to form a short cycle, which would be too easy to crack by brute force.
Finding good elliptic-curve parameters requires immense computing resources, which is why there are published "recommended" curve parameters.

The answer is yes. Bech32 is just a different encoding format. It encodes the same information as the old Base58Check encoding. Any wallet that presently produces P2WPKH-in-P2SH addresses can be enhanced to produce Bech32 addresses, with no change to the keys/seed held in the wallet.

Good to see you know what you're talking about! I haven't used estimatefee.com yet, but I'll check it out now.
Can you also confirm that your fee estimation algorithm verifies that the transactions published in each block were actually visible in the network *before* appearing in the block? Otherwise miners could be stuffing their own blocks with high-fee transactions that pay themselves, as a means of inflating the statistics.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:39:04


Here's how to spam the mempool: start by broadcasting a transaction with a very low fee rate, low enough that it'll never confirm. Then broadcast a child transaction with a very high fee rate but not high enough to make up for the low fee rate of the parent transaction. Repeat. You can stuff the mempool with as many high-fee-paying transactions as you like in this way, without paying a bit. Wallets with bad fee estimation algorithms will see all those high-fee transactions in the mempool and try to beat them, not realizing that they will never confirm.

There is a word list, which shows all the words and their numeric values (perhaps only implicitly by their positions in the list), but I think different wallets use different word lists, which is why you can't necessarily take a seed phrase from one wallet and input it into a different wallet. The most reliable way to find the word list is probably to look at the source code for the wallet you're using.

You're still speaking of Bitcoin Core specifically. It may be true that the wallet and node operations in Bitcoin Core aren't well separated.
I'm speaking generally. "Wallet" and "node" are separable functions, and indeed many Bitcoin implementations other than Bitcoin Core implement these two functions in separate processes, and you can run either without the other. (Of course, to receive or send any bitcoins with the wallet, you do need to connect the wallet to a node, though it doesn't have to be *your* node.)

Why are you excluding cash transactions, though? One of Bitcoin's greatest potentials as a worldwide currency is connecting underserved people in developing nations to global markets. This is how they can finally pull themselves out of poverty. "One transaction per person per 64 days" is not going to cut it.
So, once we accept that it isn't enough for Bitcoin to scale *only* on-chain, then we have to ask, "*by how much* does Bitcoin need to scale on-chain?" Once we accept that most individuals will use Bitcoin (the currency) via higher-layer networks, rather than posting transactions directly to the blockchain, the actual needed on-chain capacity is not very large at all.

So what's your soft-fork trick for increasing on-chain capacity beyond what SegWit gives us? To be clear, I support SegWit and BIP148 and do not support "SegWit2x," but I still recognize that we *will* eventually need to increase the base block size too, or there just won't be enough capacity even to support higher-layer networks like Lightning at global scale.


Why? If I want to send bitcoins to an IP address today, can I do it? No. Bitcoin has broken backward compatibility before, when it had good reason.


"Confiscated"? Are you referring to invalidating existing pre-signed, time-locked transactions whose private keys may no longer be known? I agree that we must not break those.


No, absolutely not. (It *could* happen, but that's not what I'm asserting as inevitable.) I'm saying, if the Core project is unwilling to merge improvements that require hard forks, then the relevance of the Core project will be eclipsed by that of another open collaboration that is willing. Thus far we've been saved by the relative incompetence of Core fork projects, but there will come a day when a team of highly skilled developers will fork the Core project because Core refused their very high-quality and highly demanded pull request simply because it requires a hard fork.

A wallet is a container for keys. Multiple keys. It makes no sense to say "the wallet's public key," as a wallet may contain multiple public keys.
I think the crux of your question is whether it's possible to derive a public key from a Bitcoin address. The answer is that it is not possible. The only way to do it is to guess and check, and you'd be guessing until the end of time.
Even if you could derive a public key from an address (which you can't), this still wouldn't buy you much since you'd still need to solve the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem to derive the private key from the public key. Quantum computers will be able to solve that problem in polynomial time, but we're still a way off from having quantum computers with wide enough quantum registers.

"Hoarding" is just a scare word. What it really means is *saving*, which in turn simply means delaying consumption to a later date. This is neither good nor bad; it's just what people do.
The economy is not somehow harmed when people save rather than spend. The point of saving, after all, *is* to spend, just not right away. Whatever money you spend today cannot be spent tomorrow, and vice versa. By expressing your *time preference* for spending now or saving now, you are *helping* the economy to allocate resources wisely to match the market's preferences. Lots of people saving means now is a better time to invest in long-term, capital-intensive projects (like research and development), and it's not such a good time to produce goods and services for immediate consumption. Eventually the preference will drift away from saving and more toward spending, and that will signal that people are ready to consume more.
When central banks manipulate interest rates, thereby altering the balance of time preferences between spending now and spending later, this *harms* the economy because it sends inaccurate information into the market. Producers see an inaccurate picture of consumers' time preferences, and they produce too much or too little, and we wind up with these cycles of boom and bust.

As an anarcho-capitalist, I *love* free-market forces. And I agree that central planning of economic variables is the height of arrogance.
The problem is that block size, if not limited by consensus rule, is not constrained by market forces. There is no balance of opposing forces that would corral the block size to an equilibrium point. Rather, there is only an upward force: the mining pool operators with the fastest Internet connectivity will always want to make larger blocks so as to force the operators with slower connectivity off of the network entirely. This game continues until only one mining pool is left standing. That's not a good outcome for Bitcoin.
With no consensus-imposed block-size limit, what would prevent the "only one pool left standing" outcome?

I.e., perform the redirection before forking the subshell.

Storage density, link speed, and processing power will continue to grow at a faster pace than the human population of the planet, meaning the transactional capacity of the Bitcoin network will soon (a couple decades at most) be far greater than the capacity of all of humanity to engage in commerce. Already a research group in Britain has a crystal glass with a storage density [2800 times that of a Blu-ray disc]( — 360 terabytes would fit on a DVD-sized disc. And Google Fiber is bringing dedicated gigabit links to each and every home and office. Storing and replicating the block chain will be minor background noise, even at worldwide "Visa scale."
Mobile devices will have a harder time, but that use case is easily solved by connecting them to multiple disparate brokers. (It's extremely unlikely that, for example, Google, Amazon, eBay, the EFF, and Hurricane Electric would *all* collude to make your mobile device's view of the block chain inconsistent with the Bitcoin network.)

`CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` is how the time lock that I mentioned is implemented. It does not "sequence" updates of a payment channel. What it does allow is some *time* for a party in a channel to notice that the counterparty is trying to close the channel using an old state. The party can then claim the funds in the channel instantly (bypassing the time lock). This ability deters the counterparty from attempting to close the channel using any previous state. That the channel updates then are effectively sequenced (each update being "revoked" when the next update is negotiated by the parties) is an emergent property of game theory, not a consensus rule. Indeed, the channel updates (except for the final one) are never seen on the Bitcoin network, let alone in the block chain, so there can be no consensus about them.

If you buy a machine, you can set its markup at whatever you want. The sell price is based on the exchange's live Ask price. The machine purchases bitcoins on the exchange in real-time when a user inserts a bill. The prototype at Liberty Forum was charging a 1% commission on top of the live MtGox Ask price. MtGox's fee came out of that commission, so we were really only making about half a percent profit. Our goal with the prototype was not to profit, so we set its commission rate very low to encourage use.

Why wouldn't you (and anyone else) immediately start using SegWit as soon as it's available? The fees will be so much lower than sending from legacy addresses.

Walmart would never use Bitpay or Coinbase. Walmart would *become* a Bitcoin exchange and handle their own currency conversions into and out of Bitcoin. They could drop the $15M or whatever it takes to get MSB licenses in all 50 states and not even notice.
I'm not sure I agree with your other point either. Walmart would never adopt Bitcoin by displaying QR codes at the checkout and having customers scan them with their smart phones. They would adopt Bitcoin by issuing prepaid Bitcoin debit cards. The computer systems would do the conversion from the dollar price at the register to the bitcoins that would be deducted from the card when you swipe it at the POS terminal. The lower-level employees wouldn't even have to know or care that the customer is using a Walmart Bitcoin debit card; the transaction would look just the same to them.

Another Dvorak user here. It took me a couple of months of forcing myself to use only Dvorak before I became even simply "not frustrated" with it. I was *much* slower on Dvorak than I had been on QWERTY when I started the transition. After about six months, I was just as fast on Dvorak as I ever was on QWERTY (faster sometimes), but more importantly, I very much believe it is a superior layout. It's more comfortable to type, and my fingers travel less. Now it's been about two and a half years since I made the switch, and I am very pleased with the results.
If you're seriously considering switching away from QWERTY, I'd suggest you consider going to the [Workman layout]( instead of Dvorak. If I had to do it all over again, I'd use that layout instead of Dvorak, but I don't want to switch again.

A very simplified example:
Imagine a roulette game with 256 slots on the wheel instead of the typical 100. These 256 slots correspond to hex numbers 00 through FF. A provably fair game of roulette might have you betting on what the last two hex digits in the next Bitcoin block hash will be. Since the block hash cannot be known or determined at the time you place your bet, the house cannot cheat. If you bet on 00 and the next block hash ends in 00, you win. There is no way for the house to affect what the next block hash will be to avoid paying out to you.
Real provably fair casino games are more complex than this example since they need to run many more games than there are Bitcoin blocks, but the principle is the same: the publicly seen outcome (roll of the dice, hand of cards, spin of the wheel, etc.) can be verified using only information that was published before any bets were placed (or, as in my example, using information that could not have been known until after all bets were placed).

About the only way it could work would be time-deposit accounts, where you can't just withdraw your bitcoins whenever you want to but instead must leave them in for a certain period of time, pretty much like a certificate of deposit.

The idea is that, with enough people pulling all of their coins off of the exchanges, we may be able to see which exchanges don't actually have all the bitcoins that have been deposited at them. The more people pull their coins out all at once, the more likely the effort is to expose exchanges that are running fractional reserves. One date was chosen to coordinate the greatest possible simultaneous withdrawal for best effect.

The "block hash" is the double SHA-256 digest of the block header. There's no hex encoding prior to hashing or between the two applications of SHA-256. (The input to the second SHA-256 is the 32-byte digest produced by the first SHA-256.) And then, for whatever reason, the final digest (the "block hash") is treated as little-endian, so the byte order is reversed when displayed in hex.

The browsers are already doing everything correctly. The problem in this case is that you're clicking on a link that has a URI scheme that no application has claimed on your system. Your Bitcoin client software should be registering itself as the handler for "bitcoin:" URIs.
The "bitcoin" scheme was recently whitelisted as an acceptable URI scheme for HTML5 URI handlers. I know Chromium (the open-source project from which Google Chrome is built) has already added "bitcoin" to its whitelist, to match the HTML5 spec. So this means that web wallet services should be able to register themselves as "bitcoin" URI handlers, much as Gmail can register itself as a "mailto" URI handler.

Native witness programs still have to appear valid to legacy clients in a soft fork. Since the legacy clients can't validate witness programs, this implies that the "conventional" portion of a witness-bearing transaction must validate under the old rules. Since all signatures are moved into the witness, the conventional portion must appear valid with no signatures. This isn't a security problem, per se, but it's an ugly artifact of evolution that could be shed if malleability were fixed by a hard fork.




Yes, it is. My point was that segregating the witness data is only necessary if one insists on a soft fork. "SegWit as a hard fork" makes no sense; you wouldn't segregate the witness data if you were doing a hard fork.


The Core developers have always been designing protocol upgrades with soft forking as a goal. (It's not a bad goal.) They always wanted SegWit to be a soft fork but initially couldn't quite get there. Eventually it was discovered that SegWit *could* be deployed as a soft fork, and there was much rejoicing.
I appreciate that the Core devs go way out of their way to avoid cutting off old clients. That's a valid development strategy. However, there is an argument on the other side (which is the one I'm making), which says that maintaining backward compatibility forever is not worth the accumulation of sludge. This has happened a lot to the Java programming language over the years, and in its present state, there is a huge amount of "compatibility" code in the JavaSE standard library, which is only maintained so that programs compiled for Java 1 will continue to function as designed.


The transaction version field exists to solve this problem. The Core devs are right when they say that the original implementations of Script opcodes must stick around forever, as we must never drop support for older Script versions. But they are wrong to avoid ever redefining existing opcodes with new or corrected functionality, so long as they bump the transaction version when they do.
A whole lot of effort goes into retaining support for the 5% of stragglers who don't upgrade, and I just believe it's worth neither the effort nor the "scars" that it leaves on the protocol design.

Unknown. "The market can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent."


You don't have to assess supply. You know the supply for the most part (minus whatever coins have been lost, which we don't know).
You can't track demand when there is "painting the tape" going on, but the fact of the collusion does not alter the *real* demand for the asset, unknowable as it may be. Markets are self-correcting, and "painting the tape" imparts only transient pressures, not a persistent/systemic pressure, on the price, so the degree to which it can bias the price discovery mechanism is limited.


Cryptocurrencies are different from all other commodities in a key way: their storage and transportation costs are effectively nil. With a physical commodity, such as gold, there is a real cost associated with taking delivery, so most holders of gold futures contracts opt to roll forward their contracts rather than taking delivery. This allows the writers of such contracts to maintain an untenable naked short position indefinitely, thus keeping a persistent downward pressure on the price (due to the increased apparent supply of the commodity). With bitcoins, however, there is zero cost associated with taking delivery, so there is less incentive for futures contract holders to roll forward their contracts. With most futures traders taking delivery, the apparent supply of bitcoins cannot grow far beyond the actual supply. This means the extent to which a manipulator can suppress the price through naked shorting is quite limited.

A Bitcoin address is Base58Check-encoded RIPEMD-160 hash of a SHA-256 hash of an elliptic-curve point (the public key). When you send bitcoins to an address, only this hash is included in your output. (You can't include the public key itself because you don't actually know it.) Only when the recipient redeems your output is the public key actually revealed. (They have to include the public key as part of the input script in their transaction in order for their signature to be verifiable.)

Be careful there. It could conceivably be difficult to find software to interface with that hardware wallet 18 years from now.

If a large enough fraction of the Bitcoin economy demands SegWit activation (via UASF BIP148 or otherwise), then SegWit *will* be activated on a chain. (Whether that chain *splits* from the legacy chain or *subsumes* it depends on how much mining power refuses to adopt SegWit.)
SegWit by itself directly provides for approximately a doubling of the on-chain transaction capacity, but the design flaws fixed in concert with SegWit activation will allow for trustless, decentralized transaction networks to be built on top of Bitcoin. Lightning Network is the most often cited example, but SegWit opens the doors to many new possibilities, of which Lightning is but one. There's no way to accurately estimate the transaction throughput that would be supported by these new technologies which SegWit enables.

"The poor" would seem to be the least affected by a currency collapse. They have no savings to be wiped out by hyperinflation. They have no investments to be wiped out by a crashing economy. The only way they'll feel the crash is because wages are sticky, though I suspect in a hyperinflation scenario, there would be a pretty quick resettling on some stabler benchmark for setting wages, even if the wages themselves are still being paid out in the rapidly depreciating currency.

"Excess profits" do not continue forever. The steady-state equilibrium for Bitcoin mining will be that all operating miners are just breaking even. There is ultimately no profit to be made by mining. However, this does not imply that no one will mine. As long as bitcoins are valued and people own bitcoins, there will be miners operating at break-even just because they want to protect their assets.

Withdrawing from MtGox into your bank account via Dwolla is fast. The MtGox-&gt;Dwolla leg takes just minutes, and if you submit the withdraw request on Dwolla during banking hours, then the funds will be pushed into your checking account via the ACH system on the next business day. (Of course, if you bank at one of the lousy megabanks, they will probably pretend they haven't received the money for another day or two, so they can profit on the interest.)
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:12:24
The equilibrium state is when every miner in operation is exactly breaking even. If any miner were losing money, they'd stop mining. And if any miners were making money, they'd be joined by more miners, which would cause the difficulty to rise, which would eliminate the profit. This is true even after the block subsidy disappears and the only reward for mining are the transaction fees. The steady state is for miners to exactly break even.
That said, we haven't reached a steady state yet. There is profit to be had in mining, but the profit potential is dwindling as we approach the steady state.

Fractional reserve banking won't work in the Bitcoin world. It works in the fiat world because it's impossible to tell the difference between a "real" dollar and an "IOU" dollar. (Truly, *all* dollars are "IOU" dollars.) A bank can conjure new dollars into existence simply by lending them out. In fact, this is how the overwhelming majority of dollars came into existence; the Fed's contribution to the dollar supply is miniscule by comparison. But that doesn't work for Bitcoin. A bank can't conjure new bitcoins into existence, and you can't transact "IOU" bitcoins on the block chain. All bitcoins are "real" bitcoins. No one would accept an "IOU" bitcoin in trade for goods and services like they would accept a "real" bitcoin. Because it's possible to tell the difference between the two, Bitcoin cannot have fractional reserve banking.

You're incorrect about this. BIP148 *rejects* non-SegWit-signaling blocks after 1 August, so the BIP148-enforcing chain will not need a majority of the hash rate to survive.

(Any less than 15%, and the blocks would be mined too slowly to reach BIP141's activation threshold before its deadline.)

I can tell you what **not** to do:
* Do not rely on CD/DVD±R[W], a.k.a. optical media. Some discs won't last 5 years, even when kept in a cool, dry, dark place.
* Do not rely on flash media (SD cards, SSDs, USB thumb drives, etc.). Flash media can lose data, even while sitting on a shelf.
* Do not generate your private key(s) on any computer that is presently connected to the Internet or will ever again be connected to the Internet. Malware can scarf them up and spit them out onto the Internet if you later reconnect. It's best to physically disconnect your computer from the Internet (unplug the cable!), boot into a read-only Linux distribution (like a Live CD), do your work there, then reboot back into your normal system before reconnecting the network cable.
* Do not print textual keys or keys encoded as QR codes using a laser printer. Laser printers can retain an image on the drum, and some even store internally a digital copy of everything they've printed.
* Do not print keys using an inkjet printer. Inkjet ink tends to fade after a few years and can even become completely invisible under pathological conditions.
* Do not print keys using a thermal printer. Thermal paper turns completely black at relatively low temperatures.
* Do not create unencrypted hard copies of your keys. Bitcoin may be little known now, but Bitcoin private keys will become a recognizable thing of value over the next several years.
* Do not keep all copies of your keys in the same geographic location. Houses burn down, and cities flood. It's best to keep multiple encrypted copies of your keys in geographically disparate locations.
* Do not record keys on combustible media or using materials with low melting points. Paper is an especially poor choice because, in addition to being highly combustible, it also tends to get brittle over time. It's best to engrave keys onto slabs of metal or ceramic.
* Lastly, do not be the only person who has access to your keys. If you die without anyone else having access, your accumulated Bitcoin wealth will effectively be redistributed to all Bitcoin users via deflation. If you'd prefer to concentrate the benefits of your untimely demise on selected individuals, you must have a backup plan. One possibility is to break up your keys into multiple shares and distribute the shares among several people whom you trust.

One last time: *all* money in the fiat system is created as debt. There is no qualitative difference between a "real" dollar and an "IOU" dollar. A good 90%+ of the dollars in your wallet, in your bank account, under your mattress — wherever — are "IOU" dollars. They aren't specific, designated bills. There's no way to have only "real" dollars in your possession. Rather, it's the proportion of the money supply that the Fed created versus the proportion of the money supply that banks created. I'm tired of making this point to you over and over, so this will be my last attempt. When you take out a home loan, an auto loan, a student loan, or any other kind of collateralized loan, the bank literally adds new dollars to your account and *does not subtract dollars from any other account*. They are allowed to do this because they record your loan agreement as an asset on their balance sheet. It's zero sum: your loan is an asset worth so much, and the dollars they created are a liability created in an equal amount. Fiat money *is* debt. Always. If everyone paid back every dollar they owed (including the government), there would be no dollars left in existence. (Actually, it's not even possible for every outstanding loan to be paid back, because loans also demand payment of interest, but the money to pay the interest can only be created through new loans.) That's how our crazy monetary system works.

The difficulty arises because Bitcoin is fundamentally incompatible with the legacy banking system. All transactions in the legacy banking system are reversible, whereas all transactions in Bitcoin are *ir*reversible. Selling bitcoins for credit-card payments is especially risky for the seller because credit-card transactions are easily reversed, especially when the "good" being sold is beyond the comprehension of a bank's fraud department.
Moving bitcoins around is extremely easy. Moving dollars around is somewhat easy. But exchanging dollars for bitcoins is risky and thus not easy. The interface between the reversible and irreversible is always going to be inconvenient. The good news is that we will have less and less use for the legacy banking system as Bitcoin adoption spreads. When you can get paid in bitcoins (as some employers are already offering), you no longer need to convert dollars to bitcoins.

The interest can be paid with money that was not borrowed into existence. Not *every* dollar came into existence through a loan. There is a (relatively tiny) quantity of money that was created standalone without an accompanying debt obligation. Sometimes it's called "high-powered money" or "central bank money." But, even ignoring this, there is no problem of paying interest with borrowed money. There *might* be a problem if all outstanding debts were to be repaid at the same time, but even then there is likely enough high-powered money to pay all the interest.

It's difficult to envision scenarios in which such a "nuclear option" would be necessary, but Satoshi clearly has a lot of foresight and takes very many precautions.
My point was that I'm not sure 1M BTC would actually be enough to kill Bitcoin. The "kill switch" may not actually work.
An amusing thought… A lot of people wonder about Satoshi's choice of 21 million bitcoins as the limit. Why did he choose a such a strange number? Maybe he really intended for there to be 20 million bitcoins in circulation (a much rounder number, don't you think?) but intentionally mined exactly 1 million bitcoins himself that he intends to keep in reserve indefinitely as a kill switch.

You can include arbitrary text strings in transactions, but such transactions are considered "non-standard," so you'd have to mine them into a block yourself or convince a miner to do so on your behalf.

I think you misunderstood. *True power* and *apparent power* are technical terms. 
And you're correct that there are not other directions of time. That was an oversimplification. What makes power real or reactive is whether the current waveform is in phase with the voltage waveform.
* A perfectly resistive load (power factor = 1) will pass current exactly in phase with the voltage applied to it. In this case, all of the power is apparent, and the apparent power in volt-amps equals the true power in watts.
* A perfectly reactive load (power factor = 0) will pass current exactly out of phase with the voltage applied to it. In this case, all of the power is reactive, and the apparent power will be zero.
* A typical electronic device has some resistive and some reactive components in its impedance (0 &lt; power factor &lt; 1) and will pass current somewhat out of phase with the voltage applied to it. In this case, some of the power is apparent, some of the power is reactive, and the apparent power will be less than the true power.
So the real reason you can't collapse units of volt-amperes into watts (or kilowatt-hours into kilojoules) is because the numbers you're multiplying are not in phase with each other. That's what I was trying to simplify by saying they're loosely in "different directions."

Neither of those are big issues. The dispensing mechanisms are made by the same companies that make the accepting mechanisms. And if someone sends too many bitcoins to the machine, the machine sends the excess back to them.

The banks could offer time-deposit accounts in Bitcoin, such as certificates of deposit. But they couldn't offer demand-deposit accounts, such as checking and savings accounts.
The only way demand-deposit accounts work is that banks create new money when they issue loans, so you can still withdraw the money you have on deposit at any time. In the Bitcoin paradigm, banks would not be creating new money when issuing loans, so you would not be able to withdraw your bitcoins that you have on deposit until the loan gets repaid.

Exactly right. Imagine if someone drives the bitcoin price up to $1000 by buying up billions of dollars' worth of bitcoins. I would sell most of my bitcoins at $1000, and I would be set for life. Then the manipulator would crash the price by selling all the coins they had acquired. Do you think I'm going to buy back in? Hell no. The dollars I took out of the market (which came from the manipulator) are not going back in. The manipulator would have lost a ton of dollars in the process of trying to manipulate the bitcoin price.

I fund the transaction as soon as I've agreed on a meeting place with the buyer. By the time we actually meet, there have been many more than 3 confirmations.


This is an argument for funding the transaction on LocalBitcoins prior to meeting up. Then the terms of the exchange are locked in and agreed to in advance of the meeting. If you wait and try to perform the exchange at the live market price at the meeting time, one or both parties may no longer agree to the terms, and then you've both wasted time and energy.

Bot traffic is not manipulation. And it's not illegal. The overwhelming majority of trades on the major stock exchanges are performed by bots. Again, that's not manipulation; that's just ordinary market dynamics. Manipulation happens when you have a dishonest player. Selling contracts to deliver assets that you don't own and couldn't possibly acquire is dishonest. The big banks do this all the time to manipulate commodities prices. But they don't do it in the bitcoin market because the mechanisms that they use do not exist in the bitcoin market. It's debatable whether those mechanisms even *can* exist in the bitcoin market.

That's a long-standing bug in that client. Just hit back a couple times until you're back at your transactions screen, and you'll see the transaction there pending. As soon as it gets into a block, you'll see the icon change from a gray dot to a green pie wedge. As more blocks are found on top of the transaction, the pie wedge will grow until it's a full pie. But even when it's just a gray dot, the other party will already be able to see the transaction on the network.

Quite right. Never before have we witnessed the birth of an entirely new commodity whose sole purpose is to act as money. Some Misesians argue that Bitcoin won't succeed because it has no usefulness aside from as money; others counter that Bitcoin's unique properties make it useful in a way that no other commodity can be used, and so Bitcoin can succeed. Either way, it is groundbreaking subject matter.
And beyond all that, it's also the first money the world has ever seen in which price deflation is intended and guaranteed (if the currency continues to survive). Some folks claim that a deflating currency will fail due to hoarding. Bitcoin is a chance to put such claims to the test in the real world with an essentially perfect experiment. Economists never get to experiment on the real world with such perfect controls. This should be an economist's wet dream to see how this plays out.

Unless your electricity usage is heavily or fully subsidized (or you purchase it for a flat fee that does not depend on how much energy you consume), mining with GPUs is not going to be worth the cost of the electricity. What this means is that the value of the bitcoins you can earn by mining with a GPU is less than the value of the dollars you'd spend on electricity to operate that GPU.
The days of panning for bitcoins in a riverbed with a sieve are over. Mining bitcoins now requires specialized hardware and lots of capital. If you wouldn't get into the business of mining for your own gold, then don't try to mine for your own bitcoins. Just buy them.

Don't buy it all in one massive order. Buy a little bit at a time. Not only will you avoid accidentally buying at a local maximum, but you will avoid eating significantly into the order book. After each small trade that you complete, other traders will "fill in" the hole you punched in the order book, and you can trade again at the same prices. If you do it all in one order, there won't be time for bots and other traders to replace their orders, and you could end up paying significantly more in total.

What it means is that it can take 15 seconds (or less) from the time you press the start button on the machine to the time when the machine submits the transaction to the Bitcoin network. Of course, it depends on how familiar you are with using the machine and how many bills you want to insert. I've done the entire process in 5.5 seconds.

Those people probably don't even need to see amounts denominated in bitcoins.

The "fast modular exponentiation by repeated squaring" technique used in RSA has a similar work pattern as the elliptic curve point multiplication used in ECDSA. It's possible to write these algorithms in a way that gives away information about the bits in the private key just from the CPU power consumption (and thus sound of the voltage regulators), but it's also possible to write these algorithms in such a way that the particular bit patterns in the key do not affect which operations are executed by the CPU and in which order. (For an example, see Montgomery's Ladder.) Hopefully OpenSSL is using one of these side-channel resistant implementations.

I meant, how are those dollars created in the first place? I was referring to the "Compound Interest Paradox," which goes something like this:
Imagine there are zero dollars in existence. Now the Fed comes along and issues a trillion dollars into existence. That issuance is a loan. Federal Reserve Notes (like all "notes" in the financial sense of the word) are debt instruments. Let's say that the Fed demands repayment of its initial $1T issuance with $1.1T after 10 years. Assuming it never issued any more dollars, then even if every dollar in existence were returned to the Fed in order to pay off the debt, there would still be a $100B shortfall. The only way that the necessary interest payment could even exist to be paid to the Fed would be that the Fed must issue more dollars. But those dollars would also need to be repaid with interest. And so we have an endless cycle.
While looking into this paradox for the umpteenth time, I happened upon [an explanation]( of the mistake implicit in it, which is that the interest paid to the central bank is destroyed along with the principal. In actuality, the interest goes to the banksters, who then spend it on their lavish lifestyles, and thus it is returned into the economy, where it eventually becomes another payment to the central bank, and the cycle repeats. This does imply that we will always be indebted to the central bank, but it does not imply an ever-increasing money supply.
Now my question becomes: *why* is the central bank of the United States a private institution, whose owners get to keep the interest and spend it on themselves, when they never put any capital at risk in the first place?

You can connect the machine to your account at an exchange. It can buy bitcoins on the exchange as customers insert bills. Of course, you'll have losing days doing that, too, as it requires you to hold fiat in your exchange account instead of bitcoins.

No, that's exactly the problem. When times get tough would be exactly the time when the issuer of these physical tokens might get desperate enough to be willing to destroy his reputation by redeeming all the bitcoins from all the private keys for all the tokens he's issued over the years. That it hasn't happened yet does not imply that it couldn't happen.
There is also the possibility that the same key pair may be used on more than one token, and you would have no way of knowing unless you tried to redeem one after someone else had already redeemed its counterpart. Since most of these tokens are never redeemed, it's likely that a fraud such as this would go undetected for a long time.

**Public Keys**
My Wallet can operate in two different modes:
* **Alerts Disabled** If you have notifications disabled your public keys are stored encrypted inside your wallet. In this mode we are unable to view your public keys and hence cannot view your balance or transactions.
* **Alerts Enabled** When notifications are enabled your public keys are inserted in a separate table along with your email, skype handle or google talk username. This mode does sacrifice some Anonymity as we can now see your public keys and view your wallet balance. However just because a wallet contains a public key does not necessarily mean they are the owner of said key (as you can add keys without the respective private key).

I know a lot of people who were waiting for the bubble to pop when the price was at $50 on the way up to $250. Point is, the price might never be as low as $125 ever again.
I'm expecting a run-up to somewhere around $300, and then a crash back to ~$100, very shortly followed by a stabilization around $150 for a few months before we enter the next exponential bubble phase.
This cycle of bubbles will continue for as long as Bitcoin adoption continues to spread. It's the only way the bitcoin price *can* behave, given the inelastic supply of Bitcoin. (Inelastic supply means the supply does not respond to changes in demand.) The bubble cycle will eventually end when everyone has fully made the switch to bitcoins.

Ah, but this is where you are wrong. The supply of fiat currency cannot follow anything other than a geometric growth function. (I said exponential before, but that's technically incorrect.) The reason why fiat currencies are locked into geometric growth is that they represent debt, upon which interest is charged. Every dollar that the Fed creates must be repaid in full with a dollar, plus some interest. Where does the money to pay the interest come from? From newly issued debt. If the money supply does not grow geometrically, then defaults are the only possible outcome. Since banksters lose in the case of a default, we can reasonably guess that they will do everything they can to avoid forcing these systemic defaults, and that means expanding the money supply perpetually. In other words, it's not just their policy; it's their only option.

A business owner likes Bitcoin and accepts it as a form of payment.
Customer: "What's Bitcoin?"
Merchant: "Well, you see, ..."
Customer: "Interesting. Where can I get some?"
Merchant: "Right here, from this cool machine."
Without the machine, the merchant has to backpedal and start talking about opening exchange accounts and linking checking accounts and verifying identity, and the customer's interest is lost.
The machine is a way for the merchant to bridge from a customer's question of "what is Bitcoin?" to having a repeat and loyal customer who comes through the door repeatedly to buy bitcoins and maybe products too. Merchants like things that get people in the door.

I don't understand how the ring is being topped up. Where does the money come from? Is the app connected to the merchant's Bitcoin wallet?
Also, this whole concept seems backwards. You're recreating the problem inherent in credit cards, which is that the customer has to give the merchant every bit of information necessary for the merchant to take as much money as they wish from the customer. In other words, you're creating a "pull" payment method, when Bitcoin naturally follows a "push" method.
The ring concept is cool, but it really needs a tiny e-ink or chLCD that can display the amount and the recipient and a button that the user can hold while tapping the ring a second time to authorize the ring to sign the transaction supplied by the merchant.

Such activity affects neither the demand nor the supply. Any resulting effect on the price, therefore, is transient.


This is true, which is why I allowed that this point is debatable. You can write a futures contract for any commodity, virtual or physical, but the questions are whether you will find any buyers and whether your contracts will trade at a discount to the actual commodity due to the risk that you will default. If the market perceives a high risk that you will default, then you will not be able to suppress the market price of real bitcoins by writing and selling new futures contracts; you will only depress (further) the price of your own futures contracts.

My cash (what little I carry) never leaves my wallet. I rather believe this is the state in which people in North America have grown to expect money to exist. Bitcoin is not so different in that respect.
Where Bitcoin does differ significantly is that, unlike credit cards, where you give the merchant the power to *pull* money from your account, when using Bitcoin, you don't give the merchant any power to do anything; you instead *push* money to the merchant's account (address).

is correct to some extent. With the recent proliferation of ASIC mining hardware, the block generation rate has been significantly faster than 1 block per 10 minutes. Whenever the difficulty adjusts upward to compensate for the increasing mining power, the rate of bitcoin creation slows down, closer to the target of 25 BTC per 10 minutes. This does decrease the rate of growth of the money supply, which causes an increase in the rate of bitcoin price appreciation.
I haven't looked at the charts to confirm this, but my hypothesis is that the steepest increases in Bitcoin price should occur shortly after upward adjustments in the difficulty. Price appreciation should slow down (or even reverse) toward the end of each 2016-block difficulty period, because the rate of bitcoin generation increases within each period before being "reset" to 25 BTC per 10 minutes at each difficulty step.

Both scenarios invoke exchange rate risk. If you're holding onto dollars when you could be holding onto bitcoins, then you're running the risk that the bitcoin price versus the dollar might shoot up. There is no "safe" way to do it. You just have to decide which you trust more: dollars or bitcoins.

Correct. Bitcoin is not fiat. "Fiat" is Latin for "let it be done." In other words, a fiat currency gets its value by decree (usually of a government). In contrast, Bitcoin gets its value on an open market. No one is decreeing that bitcoins have value.

There is no currency risk or exchange-rate risk. The bitcoins that you pay go straight to Coinbase, which immediately sells them for dollars.

But that's just the thing. They couldn't crush Bitcoin this way. The community would band together, roll back the block chain, and change the cryptography to something the NSA can't break. We've already demonstrated that the broad mining community can work together to undo a catastrophe, as happened earlier this year with the hard fork that occurred when 0.8.0 was released. The NSA would blow their wad for nothing if they tried to kill Bitcoin by cracking keys.
Beyond that, there's no motive for the NSA to kill Bitcoin. They don't share the motives of Congress or the White House or the Federal Reserve. For the most part, they are autonomous and have a single drive: gather and analyze information. Killing Bitcoin would do nothing for them. In fact, they have good reason to want Bitcoin to *succeed*: it moves "cash" transactions onto the Internet, where they can watch them much more easily.

Being scarce does indeed support the price. It's necessary, but it's not sufficient. Bitcoins also have to be useful. And they are!
There is one way in which the energy necessary to produce a bitcoin factors into the price, but it's somewhat indirect. Miners will try to avoid selling their work product at a loss if they can help it. So if the market price is lower than their costs, then they may sit on their bitcoins until a later time when the price is higher and they can break even or even turn a profit. This puts an upward pressure on the price when it is below the production cost.
But the energy put into producing bitcoins is not what gives them value. I could spend a million dollars to produce an atomically perfect diamond as big as my fist, and I could put it on the market, asking one million dollars for it. Your argument is that my diamond is worth at least a million dollars because that's how much I spent to produce it. But if it doesn't sell at that price, then it's not worth that much, regardless of how much money/time/energy I put into producing it.

The machine doesn't run a Bitcoin wallet itself. That would be insane in terms of required storage, RAM, and network bandwidth. If you're going to sell pre-bought bitcoins (as opposed to having the machine purchase them for you on demand from an exchange), then you keep those bitcoins in a wallet on a server somewhere, and you give the machine a key to talk to that wallet on that server. That key is what gets erased if the machine detects trouble (power outage, intense vibration, door opening, etc.). The operator reloads the wallet access key (and/or exchange API credentials) into memory from encrypted storage by presenting a secret key on a QR code.

A 1% fee on 2500 BTC is a significant chunk of change. It's not that hard to send your bitcoins into an account on a Bitcoin exchange and sell them on the open market for dollars, euros, or whatever other currency you need to pay your suppliers and contractors.
P.S.: Try to get your suppliers and contractors to accept payment in bitcoins themselves. The closer we get to "closing the loop," the stronger the bitcoin economy will get.

It doesn't print a key. Even if no one saw the printout, the buyer would be forced to move the bitcoins immediately to another address because the machine would have the private key for the address it generated. It's more secure for the user to provide the address to the machine, so it never knows the private key, and that's exactly how the Lamassu machine works.

This isn't good enough. A transaction can have an arbitrarily high fee and still never confirm, if it depends (transitively) on some other transaction that never confirms.
Example: I create a transaction that spends a coin and sends some change to another address I control. I never transmit this transaction to the network. Next, I create a transaction that spends the change from the previous transaction and sends some bitcoins to a merchant. I include a fee of 1 BTC. The merchant sees this transaction with its huge fee and immediately fills my order. The transaction never confirms.

By doing this, you're placing a bet that the encryption algorithms used by TrueCrypt (or whatever encryption mechanism you choose to use) will not be successfully broken during the lifetime of the keys. Personally I'd say that's a pretty safe bet, but it's still not quite as secure as the completely offline methods.
If the NSA has the ability to crack AES, do you think they'd advertise that fact? Of course not. They want the whole world to continue believing AES is secure and using it. So if you put your private keys in an encrypted file online, you're also placing a bet that certain governmental organizations don't already have the ability to crack the ciphers you're using.

(No other commodity has that property.) And I conjecture that this "bubble cycle" is the *only* way we could expect such a commodity's price to behave during the commodity's adoption phase. I assert that market dynamics and game theory lead inexorably to the cyclic behavior we are seeing. Takeaway: buy during the flat periods, and hold during the ramp-up and crash-down periods.

For the same reason that battery backup manufacturers quote power limits in VA (volt-amperes) rather than watts. It has to do with power factor. The dirty little secret of the electricity generation and delivery industry is that, unless you have a digital smart meter, they can't measure your true energy usage; they can only measure your apparent energy usage. If you have a large capacitive or inductive component in your load, then your apparent energy usage will be much lower than your true energy usage.
Imagine a two-dimensional coordinate system in which one axis is measured in kilowatts and the other axis is measured in hours. The area within an axis-aligned rectangle with vertices at the origin and at any other point in the plane will have units of kilowatt-hours. You cannot collapse this unit into kilojoules because the power component and the time component are in "different directions," loosely. It's the same reason torque is expressed in newton-meters and not joules: the force component is in a different direction than the distance component.

I have not seen any altcoins that have a sufficiently distinct use case that they might survive on their own. One way of having a sufficiently distinct use case would be to solve a problem that Bitcoin doesn't solve, but no altcoins have done that yet. (Sure, they may have different mechanics, but the problem that an altcoin solves has to be a *real* problem, not something contrived.) Until and unless an altcoin solves some new, real problem that Bitcoin does not solve, Bitcoin will remain the only coin in town.

Two words: "excess reserves." Almost all of this money supply glut is parked in deposit accounts at the Fed bank, earning 0.25% interest.

You didn't pay a high enough fee on the first one. (You should pay at least 0.0001 BTC per kilobyte, rounding up. Your first transaction is just a bit larger than 1 KiB, but you only paid 0.0001 BTC as a fee.) Your second transaction is fine, but it depends on the first one as an input, so it can't get into a block until the first one does.
Your first transaction probably is not going to confirm. You should create a new one that spends the same outputs, but with a higher fee, and submit it instead. Be sure that your second attempt spends the *same* outputs as your first attempt, or there is a possibility that your first attempt could eventually go through, and thus you would have paid twice. You'll have to research how to build a transaction manually, as I don't think any clients yet allow you retry a pending transaction but with a higher fee.

That's a great point. You are correct about the state of the software *today*. However, that behavior is contrary to a miner's best economic interests. The incentive for the miner is to include into the next block whatever combination of transactions maximizes the profit (fees) for the miner. A rational miner would accept the second transaction, replacing the first, if the second transaction had a greater fee attached. It's only a matter of time before mining pools start optimizing the code to maximize their profits.

It's only for the first day, and if you're doing 10 BTC per day because of the daily limit, then you should be aware that Coinbase is stupid about how they handle daily buys. If their batch job runs just a few seconds earlier on one day than it ran on the previous day, then your buying limit will not have "recharged" fully to 10 BTC, and they'll skip the buy entirely for that day. A workaround is to set your daily order to buy 9.9 BTC.

You're making it much too complicated.
1. Buyer and seller jointly generate a 2-of-2 multi-sig address.
2. Buyer creates and signs a transaction that sends the purchase amount to the multi-sig address but does not yet broadcast the transaction to the network.
3. Buyer and seller jointly create and sign a transaction that spends the output of the buyer's transaction to a charity that they both agree on. The transaction has nLockTime set so that it will not become valid for some period of time.
4. Buyer and seller jointly create, but do not yet sign, a transaction that spends to the seller the output of the buyer's transaction.
5. Buyer broadcasts his initial transaction to the network.
6. If the buyer and seller complete their trade successfully, then they both sign the transaction created in step 4 and broadcast it to the network. (The transaction created in step 3 is thereby invalidated.)
7. If the buyer and seller do not complete their trade, then when the nLockTime expires, either party may broadcast to the network the transaction created in step 3. (The transaction created in step 4 is thereby invalidated.)

It's the hashes of the Bitcoin blocks that are assumed to be random and unknowable in advance.

Even that won't work. Once they start cracking keys, the devs will add a new address type to Bitcoin that uses a crypto scheme that is resistant to quantum computing, and then we'll all simply move our coins into the new addresses.
In the meantime, the best way you can protect your bitcoin wealth from quantum computing is to keep the majority of your coins at an address from which you've never sent a payment (so that the public key isn't known to the network). Even a quantum computer can only cut the number of bits of search space for a hash in half (so the goons would need to expend effort on the order of 2^80 to find a private key that hashes to the address where you're holding your coins).

Different credit cards offer different fees, interest rates, features, and rewards programs. Bitcoin and Litecoin are functionally identical. There is no need for both to exist. All else being equal, the one with greater market penetration (Bitcoin) will sap all the market share from the lesser altcoins. The only way an altcoin could actually defeat Bitcoin would be if it were as much superior to Bitcoin as Bitcoin is to fiat currency. Litecoin is not such an altcoin. Zerocoin could be, but its anonymity features will be added to Bitcoin if they work well, and so Zerocoin will then die the same death as all altcoins.

Not at all true. If a transaction claims (as an input) an output from another transaction that has not yet been broadcast to the network (or which has but is too low-priority to ever confirm), then the transaction will never confirm, despite having propagated throughout the entire Bitcoin network.
Assuming that a transaction will confirm just because it has achieved full network propagation will get you burned.

That's not how it works. If 90% of the coins were out of circulation and someone sold the remaining 10%, then there would be no more coins for sale, meaning the ask price would effectively be infinity (or maybe undefined).
Even if you're only talking about the price of the last trade (rather than the price to acquire one more bitcoin), you can't conclude that selling 10% of the supply would knock the buy side of the market down by 10%. It just all depends on how much open interest there is on the buy side. For example, if Jihan were to sell 10% of all BTrash in existence, he would completely wipe out all the open interest in buying BTrash. He's sitting on a pile of toxic assets that he can't liquidate.

The only way the Bitcoin block database could be lost would be if every copy (hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide) were somehow erased nearly simultaneously. Given that the earth is roughly spherical, there are not many ways in which this could happen.
The atmosphere could be ignited by a sufficiently powerful fusion bomb (i.e., turning the earth into a star), but humankind would no longer be around to care about the loss of Bitcoin.
The electromagnetic pulse from a thermonuclear explosion can destroy the controller boards in hard drives and scramble the flash memory cells in SSDs, but an EMP doesn't "wrap around" the planet, so there would need to be numerous nuclear airbursts scattered around the globe. Even then, it's unlikely that they would succeed in destroying every hard drive with a copy of the block database.

Using a new address does help you stay resistant to cryptographic attacks on ECDSA, but it does *NOT* help you remain anonymous. Consider what happens if you post a donation address on your blog and then you create another address that you will use one time to receive a payment that you want to keep private. You receive some donations to your blog address, and you receive the private payment to your one-time address. Now you send some of your bitcoins for something innocuous, say, buying a gift card on Gyft. Whoops. Now your "private" address and the address on your blog are both listed in the sending addresses of a single transaction, meaning it's overwhelmingly likely that the two addresses belong to the same person. Your "private" address isn't private at all anymore.
