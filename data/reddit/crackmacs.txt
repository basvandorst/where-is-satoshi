Here's an explanation that might make more sense since Googling it didn't help ya - 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:02:58
Hmm.. Can you sum up what they did?
@_date: 2015-12-14 06:33:04
There's a referral scheme of course, I drop my link, I get a % of your earnings or something like that. I have not included it, I just wanted to share the news that this is an easy way to acquire Bitcoin &lt;3
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:35:29
OP is lying to steal our bitcoins!!!!! /s
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:44:59
I understand the feeling of a popular  pseudonym.. This name is an alias I adopted in 2009 (based on a street corner in my city called it), it's fun being anonymous online and stuff... while in person I'm just some nobody without any paper degrees. It's weird. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:46:03
I did. Looks interesting 
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:12:49
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:10:52
this doesn't have anything to do with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-16 03:18:15
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:13:33
Holyshit. Perhaps a media outlet can pick up on this? Have you contacted French customs for some kind of statement? Seems so ludicrous; telling you you're under arrest?? 
All in all it sounds like a typical power tripping idiot. I'm in awe though. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:22:46
That is quite the stretch 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:41:52
~£2100 is a lot.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:19:02
It was around there a year ago I believe. Maybe even lower. Wonder if we'll see that again.
@_date: 2015-05-24 06:26:39
Shouldn't they have blacked out his last name too? isn't this technically sharing personal information?
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:13:37
what's a field day
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:01:15
Damn. I wonder what would happen if it really were to tank like that. I'd probably max out all of my credit cards buying it up. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:36:40
750k net worth IS rich sir. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:06:55
I didn't see "2011" and immediately got a rush of adrenaline thinking I could buy some BTC for my first time at dirt cheap prices. 
ah frig
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:00:54
! damn. You're right. I have like $60 in litecoin still? something like that. Makes me weak sometimes :p
(waiting for the price to increase so I can dump it for btc to become pure)
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:44:03
Wow, a beer for $3.50, I wish. $5-9 a beer here, depending where you go. Damn Canadian dollar.

@_date: 2017-02-09 20:59:43
I can get behind that dream ��
I've never even had more than my 0.19. Wish I had listened to my friend. He got big into mining early on, but sold them all for like 75 cents each or something. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:24:45
Is it that difficult? Hah. Like I said, pretty clueless. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:52:16
Yes and no - see (sidebar!) you can do surveys for bitcoin and other stuff.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:30:49
Can someone please ELI5? Less than 1x BTC hodler here. 
* What was the ETF going to do for Bitcoin?
* What will happen now?
* What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin?
* If the price drops, as people here are saying it will, should I sell everything I own and buy up as much as I can?
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:29:07
C'mon guys $4700 market cap we can do itttttt
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:32:20
I wonder if he has any [Ron Paul coins]( squirreled away
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:35:41
Uh huh. [This image says otherwise](
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:25:13
I get free electricity (well, included in my rent). Hrm. As a Bitcoin enthusiast but long time super n00b, are there any miners available for purchase these days that I might look into? Even if it took a year to generate 1 coin, I'd be okay with that. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:53:18
I still have 3 RonPaul coins lol
@_date: 2016-03-26 20:38:37
no spam or anything, just thought it was awesome to see questions about crypto alongside that of credit cards. The last screenshot is just an example of the other kinds of questions in the survey. First for me. Lots of people do these far as I'm aware.. so it's legitimately exposing people to crypto, in a way. thumbs up!
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:08:34
Anytime I've ever mentioned it in they have little OMG SCAM BLAH BLAH BLAH tantrums. I only have 1 friend that has any interest in cryptocurrency :( 
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:41:08
Wish Calgary had a better scene :( 
@_date: 2016-06-11 23:16:57
I thought that he was 21 for half the video
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:15:12
Better dump that fiat quick
@_date: 2016-11-18 20:40:31
Thanks for the heads up. Closed my account and donated what was left to one of the charity companies.
@_date: 2016-12-13 00:51:34
It's almost as if people are excited about this technology
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:46:04
My 0.19 btc is sitting on btc-e. I went to get it off today, forgot I had an authenticator setup, removed it.. account is locked for 2 weeks. Guess I'll be seeing it in 2 weeks. I hope. 
I am dumb.
@_date: 2016-11-10 07:30:24
I wish there was a +for hugs because you would get +50hugs for being so rad
@_date: 2016-11-18 20:33:26
I see you're not in Canada.
@_date: 2016-11-12 05:08:19
0.19 checking in. Long way to go. Proud of you TwoDog!
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:35:14
For something like that I'd pay 3 or 4 exposures.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:22:28
yeah it's in USD, minus a fee. Stupid loonie :( we are at 0.76 US for 1 CAD right now. it could even drop further 
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:37:51
Spent time mining doge and ltc and other altcoins back in the day with my video card, never really made any money off of it but it was really fun. No mining anymore, but I will be investing in BTC as I'm able to spare some cash (now that the Mrs is on board). &lt;3 crypto

Huh. The website OP used to host the image  - Get paid bitcoin to use the internet
Supload is free image hosting that splits the profits with you from advertising.
Neat, never heard of this site before. Has anyone actually made anything from doing this? 
@_date: 2017-04-19 04:08:36
How many views we talking? It's a great model I think. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:56:24
He probably acts like this in person and nobody gives a flying fuck. 
I'd head to Instagram, at least they'll pretend
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:56:50
you can buy things with it? Suspicious
@_date: 2015-04-12 01:58:50
Awesome, thanks for the clarification :D
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:15:50
Yey! I love you kind sir
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:35:50
Nice comment history. It appears as though you work for HitBTC. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 04:46:26
should have carved your wallet address into it
@_date: 2015-09-14 17:43:54
Thought it was a neat idea, and we certainly don't get many BTC events here in Calgary Alberta Canada. Their site: 
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:36:45
I know some of those words
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:38:31
OP maybe message these guys as it appears as though they work for HitBTC
* * See their comment histories. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 23:36:28
Hi Dorian, did you know a group of people pooled some bitcoin specifically for you?
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:51:36
the markup aside, I'm happy someone is trying to promote BTC in Calgary :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:03:30
I'm all over the damn place hahah :)
@_date: 2017-05-04 02:24:10
Wouldn't everyone need to wait around for the payment? How is that decided? 
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:04:00
Awesome :D The more the better
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:09:46
A friend told me about bitcoin really early on, I mined a very meager amount on my shitty computer, didn't have any means of doing anything more. Forgot about it until things were exploding towards the $1200 mark. 
Wish I had somehow been able to get into the game back then and mine some actual coins. Have about $40 in btc now through trading doge/ltc a bit.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:58:34
I don't understand this but I am glad you guys are on top of it. To me, a hobbyist/enthusiast or whatever, layman? It seems like Craig's story just doesn't add up. He should have rock solid proof but isn't providing it? If he were Satoshi, it would be pretty trivial right? 
@_date: 2015-10-17 22:37:53
That's really awesome, there are some great generous people in the world
@_date: 2016-05-22 18:45:17
A $90,000 steam wallet sounds pretty good to me

It's worth a nice chunk of change, you could get the best trains and fill an entire house. Any plans to use it? 
The world really got into your privacy, sorry

I haven't personally used their machine yet, but, I think it moved from Waves to Blanca?

 not

I recorded my first experience and it was very easy 
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:47:51
Mario kart 64, specifically. Those were the days.
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:43:14
When I was 17 I was playing mario kart and getting drunk on vodka and OJ. Damn.
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:02:09
I sympathize but your coins and cash are gone :&lt;
