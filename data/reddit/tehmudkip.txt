So authority of the blockchain would be over 50% of the network agreeing with such transactions, couldn't we modify the blockchain so that these transactions never happened, and then all the bitcoins in question be transferred to a secure address instead?  All it would take is at least half the people's hashing power to "agree" that this is how the blockchain should be and this whole issue would be resolved.

I haven't spent a single penny of my own money on bitcoins.  I mined a bunch and I can't withdraw money without tons of dox (or the bitcoins now) from mtgox so might as well just have fun with it.

Soooo many crybabies in this subreddit

logarithmic graph of course.  Everybody should know that exponential growth can't be sustained forever.

Like any law... make sure it's in writing.

I tried a bit later and the orders stuck.  Earlier they were being kicked out and only partially filled despite having adequate funds.  You can bet they're meddling around with things.  Just watch: the price will tank or skyrocket and then go back again very soon.
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:02:31
I had a buy order at 95 dollars... it bottomed at 90 yet the order never went through.  Odd.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:46:15
Yes, there were enough funds... try doing an order for like 1,000 bitcoins at .01 and watch it get erased.

Not to mention buying anything from tigerdirect means being on their spam and snail-mailing list getting a fat catalog every week for the next ten years.

Yes, of course.

I was mining them when they were $5 each.

Which means doing nothing.  No regulation will mean no confidence as we now see with MtGox.

It's up to 319.  I put in a sell order and just made 208 bucks.  Who's the sucker now? :)
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:05:22
Meh... wait five minutes I guess.  Is there any reason why coinbase is $613 though?

I think they're being idiots on purpose to drive the market price down... then buy it all up then "fix" things and cash out after it "recovers".
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:54:31
I'll stick to buying my $20 bills for $20.  If you want to buy some for more than that, let's get in touch, I have quite a supply I can hook you up with.  I'll even give you "friend" prices... $40/each.
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:48:00
I have over 60 in gox right now... should have cashed out :/

It was Shawn Fanning.  Did all those drugs you did off silkroad damage your brain?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:45:47
Yeah, and all of your cash can be stolen by one little private key over the Internet without even entering someone's home!  Great thinking!

Newegg has been good, however, there's many other merchants that have required credit card chargebacks to get money back for not delivering.  With this bitcoin crap you have no recourse.  All sales final.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:07:01
Yet another sob story of how there's no theft or consumer protection on bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:34:14
That's exactly how it works.  Less than 10,000 bitcoins can influence Mt. Gox even more than that.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:20:58
Anybody can skew statistics to look one way or another.  Better make the graph logarithmic so it looks "better" for your argument.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:17:56
Yeah, like I want to pay with something I have no way of getting back if the merchant doesn't deliver.
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:12:21
Think of how it could surge the market if somebody suddenly just dumped a million bitcoins at a lowball price?
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:21:11
Yep... just "coincidence" lol.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:54:34
Actually these bitcoin investors are all emotional.  NO logical person would invest in such a volatile and risky market.
