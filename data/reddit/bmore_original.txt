I appreciate it brother. It just irritates me to have people twist definitions or insert words to justify their agenda.  I also like to stay social and reachable. It bugs me that people make a post then they never respond. It just seems weird to throw yourself out there and not converse with people that respond. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:16:25
Well you make a lame point.  I was guaranteed an outcome and only after realized it was a gimmick. I’m not an astronomer nor do I spend my time in thought about sun travel and the intricacies of solar panels and the correlation betwixt them.   I have a skill set that I am well versed in and I have many areas that I can proclaim knowledge. I think your ego and want of being superior intellectually forced you to continue to comment and proclaim this valuable knowledge. Why weren’t you an advocate for understanding in commercials and following behind these companies contradicting their claims?  I promise you, you won’t get the accolades that you think with your high IQ intelligent comments. You’d be better off ragging on some other sub content.

I was given a site survey and it was determined that the array I have would cover my energy consumption. I live in the south and also have a fairly large home. My state offers enormous rebates in conjunction with federal credits.  I didn’t compare to my yearly average, but used a summer bill as my guide.  Through my electric company, they don’t reimburse for over production, and I didn’t opt for battery storage.  I went through 2 solar companies and they have almost identical plans for my array.  But thanks for the information.

It’s all digital though brother. I don’t see a need to write it. Although, have you seen Africans signatures to avoid forgery?  Some of these guys draw ornate art so their names can’t be forged.

Ummm. I’m not downvoting anyone because I honestly don’t care nor was my post expected to gain so much attention. You absolutely twisted my statement from a default position to a microscopic position. I never dissuaded anyone from joining my post nor have I promoted it, as evidenced by many young people commenting and me flabbergasted by the realization that this early meme has been spread worldwide.   You can r/gatekeep all you’d like, but you are wasting your time here homie....

I can downvote you too. Crazy how that works. I knew how it worked but I had a guarantee by the company I wouldn’t have to pay an electric bill after the installation. So you can take your BS to some other sub and spout your nonsense somewhere else. And your username checks out because you are proclaiming nonsense and you have absolutely pointless arguments. Being promised an outcome and not receiving the outcome doesn’t mean I didn’t research the topic you moron.

Please learn the definition of gatekeeping. I’ve already had to scold others of their inaccurate claims. You seriously aren’t going to get upvotes in a positive post so wtf are you bothering making a comment to the negative?  Your gatekeeping claim is BS by definition and you only make yourself look ignorant. Delete now or be screenshotted and used against you later. I never excluded anyone.  I’m older and out of touch with the younger generations, hence I had no clue this was still heavily drawn today. I mean, if you want to be an ass and be pissed off at the opportunity for us older people to reflect on our younger days, be my guest, but you only look like an asshole denying people of their great memories. 
r/gatekeeping defines it as “when someone takes it upon themselves to decide does or does not have access or right to a community or identity.”  No where in my title or anywhere else did I exclude any other generation.

It makes sense to capture the path of the sun, but the cost outweighs the benefit. Considering the activity, wear, stagnant movement...  It just doesn’t make sense. My biggest issue was wasting farmland for crops and vegetation in general. The solar array would have wiped out a big portion of potential farm land for me. I have only 2 acres of open gardening, the rest other 8 acres is forest.  I’d rather not cut down trees to promote farming nor solar harnessing. I considered many aspects and what I have was the best option for me. I honestly don’t play a huge role in carbon offsets but I’ve dedicated what I can afford to it. I’ll be adding on, in the near future, to my solar array.  I was a little upset that they didn’t give me the option to expand which I had hoped for. I wanted the full frontal of my house to be solar, but they reduced it to a small area over my 4 car carport. My arrangement isn’t small by any means but I would definitely want a larger contribution to reducing our footprint. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 01:59:38
It’s not gatekeeping. I never denied access to the rights. I only pointed out older generations would understand the symbol. You should understand the definition before making wild assertions.

@_date: 2019-03-12 23:34:01
Sorry but you are an idiot. I have not once bashed solar panels. I love solar panels and wish I would have purchased more. I do bash the sellers and I did do my research and looked at the path of the sun. Indirect sunlight produces little benefit for energy consumption. Direct sunlight has the highest levels of energy production. My house is aligned where I receive indirect sunlight for the majority of the day and peak sunlight for a limited time. In the best case scenario, my house is ideal for the average home. The only better option is solar panels on 2 sides of the home picking up direct sunlight twice a day or an array that tracks the motion of the sun in the field beside my home. You wanna be geniuses have lots of assumptions and little basis in reality.

Yeah. It’s cool though. I love my solar array. I see it pulling into my driveway constantly and I just absolutely love it. It may have cost me but at least I feel I’m doing something for the world. I’m really hopeful for the summer months to see how this array really holds up. I appreciate You standing up for me. My next home will be built specifically for energy conservation and production.

You implied that I said “only” because you made it a point. There was no implications. It was a statement that older people would understand.  
You seem to not grasp language and definitions. 
I DGAF what is allowed/tolerated in a BS sub. If their definition doesn’t stick and they allow posts that contradict their statement, they are meaningless. This is no fault of mine. In the end, you lose regardless of the posts because my statement doesn’t fit the definition and you still look like a fool.  I have not once denied anyone access or rights to this symbol. I am actually advocating for this symbol to be accepted which is completely opposite of what the definition of gatekeeping entails. So go blow smoke up someone else’s ass because you aren’t going to make ground here.

Maybe you’d grow a brain cell and see I’m not complaining at all, yet warning others of the shady practices of solar panel sellers.  But no....

Yeah sure. It is, but is is cost efficient?  I’m already spending more than I achieve. Should I just sell everything and wear solar garments?

Yeah. Don’t rely on what you were told. I installed end of summer last year and haven’t seen a good bill yet. Over the winter my bill reduction was only 25% less than normal not including the solar panel bill, which actually made my bill higher. Really it all depends on which direction your house faces and how much sun you receive. My house doesn’t match the sun’s path so I receive sun most of the day but it’s indirect and only peaks for a short time.

Not at all. I enjoy my solar panels and wished I had purchased more.

I didn’t lease. I bought them on a payment plan. Either way....  If your house isn’t aligned for maximum sun, they don’t work as proclaimed. I was told that I would only owe $5 a month for meter service. They failed to mention that was an ideal setup and it varied home to home. I really don’t care for the cost or output. I was only really interested in reducing my global footprint. I only commented as a buyer beware scenario. It isn’t all what we are led to believe. I will say, after I sell this home in the next few years and purchase my retirement home, I will align my house for optimal sunlight, well or spring water, etc etc etc.

Zealotry is an unhealthy obsession. 
“The numerical interpretation that 666 is the equivalent of the name and title Nero Caesar (Roman Emperor 54–68 AD).[19][20][21][22][23][24] Written in Aramaic, this can be valued at 666 using the Hebrew numerology of gematria, and was used to secretly speak against the emperor. Also "Nero Caesar" in the Hebrew alphabet is נרון קסר‎ NRON QSR, which when used as numbers represent 50 200 6 50 100 60 200, which add to 666.”

Mmmmm.  Gold has never plummeted in price like BTC. As much as I love crypto, this type of nonsense doesn’t help the cause.

Partial Athenians. Athenians were considered boy lovers and weren’t really a fighting force compared to the Spartans from what I’ve understood.  According to Wikipedia, the Peloponnese were the main force behind leonidas. This isn’t my realm of research and you definitely could be absolutely correct. I enjoyed the movie but I focus my time on much earlier history in regards to Sumeria, Egypt and the Hebrews. I’ve grown bored of the earliest civilizations tbh, now would be a good time to dive in to Greco/Persian societies. Any resources you’d suggest to begin?

I predict millennials will keep BTC afloat if not make it commonplace. Surveys have shown, millennials are more interested in crypto than common currency.

You people keep saying that....  In the end the Spartans conquered the Persians. 300 was the first part of the story. It doesn’t speak on the 10,000 Spartans that sent the Persians into retreat.

Realistically bitcoin isn’t scarce. It can be copy pasted as is and continue. The intrinsic value of bitcoin is people accept the original chain and most wouldn’t buy a duplicate.

I’ve held since $4K. I came in this market 10 October 2017. I relished the massive gains and held through the massive dump. Thankfully I diversified and caught Vatican chain at .20. That drop of godliness has saved me from decimation. I can’t remember which group I’m replying to so I won’t say the name but wechain, sub the w for v, and you’ll see. Massive gains and much more to come. Wechain is going to be  and the old dude named Walt or whatever will be selling out to that v something.  Fanboys will be upset and lose money but it is what it is. Can’t deny facts. Goodbye Walton leash. Your little poop plot has been determined. Enjoy your big gainz while you can. Sell high, buy VEN low. Ijs.

Idiots. The whole point is for clicks. If you just ignore the negativity and not click on their BS stories promoting the downfall but promote the positive, it’ll bring more attention and they’ll stop promoting doomsday prophecies for bitcoin.

Was that their idea for you to use their retirement savings?  I would be terrified to use anyone else’s money. I’m up 5X my initial since investing last October. I tell people there is money to be made here but it is risky just so I don’t feel bad if they make bad decisions.

Of course, you are late just like Pizza Hut!!!  Ordered a pizza 1 hour later I call....  “We tried to
deliver but we couldn’t find your house”.  Uhh, it’s the only fucking huge 2 story house on the street. Well, we couldn’t find it. Get hung up on when calling the store. Maybe I should donate a Lamborghini to them for deliveries. Maybe then they’d deliver my pizza!!!

Cause you are weak minded. Bitcoin is forever but yet you deny this fact, hence your second, third, fourth, etc yourself. Just don’t worry about it. If you do need the money come back when you do and you’ll be astonished.  This is a buy and forget type of Investment. Delete all knowledge
Of crypto and leave a will just in case......... I promise you. you  will be ecstatic over your end goal. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:05:25
No. Bitcoin will never be used as a store of value in any realistic sense. It’s too volatile. Transaction fees are only down because the volume is down. When we have the next run it’s going to be the same story. When we get fiat to crypto pairings across the board bitcoin may be semi stable. Just look how devastating btc is on the market as a whole. Satochi values are almost the same as precrash, which means many held on for dear life. Once unbuckled from BTC crypto will flourish. Bitcoin is The Godfather and we can’t deny it but it needs to be separated from the whole of crypto for this space to continue.
