Well, you would need a bank card to take money from an ATM. 
If someone wants to buy BTC then they'll need a wallet.

Bet your bottom dollar this bloke will have to sign an NDA when they settle

Could you just tip yourself with Bitcoin and it would come back?

Is this for stock trading? I'm using plus500 and seems to be working fine and by fine i mean making clams :-)
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:15:02
That's fine man, you were at least a part of this life changing time
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:02:54
My p500 started with a 100 buy and then one more deposit of 250. Current balance is roughly $1.6k, not too bad 
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:53:14
Are there people on localbitcoins.com from your area?
This would be a good way to avoid the fee's
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:22:35
news.com.au continues to produce terrible articles and terrible writing. Keep it up guys. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:50:18
I'm using plus500.com which is a stock trading site and it can send normal alerts for BTC/USD rates via email or txt
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:00:43
I'll try not to sound sarcastic but good story bro. Just signed up to localbitcoins and looks heaps better compared to other places which want commission and trading fees etc
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:14:41
Yeah just sign up with an email address and you can use that for tracking
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:46:47
Nice try figure_d_it_out
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:01:07
I got in when was $300 and thought I missed the boat. I'm on a tight budget but that spare $100 I put in is really paying off and all my SO is saying "Are you sure this is real profits?"
@_date: 2013-12-23 12:58:24
Took me a week and a bit. Sent them an email as a reminder and then identified. You can still deposit cash at a NAB branch
 
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:46:37
I don't know much on details but I'm using Plus500 for trading and it's listed. Made a nice little profit and still climbing. Just not sure if there would a difference in cashing out and buying coin or just invest back into the options
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:11:53
Heaps of opportunities.
Who tells large stores if a Walmart? McDonalds etc is a viable place to build in?
Who can predicted the better growth areas for investment properties to increase ROI?
Who can tell if a wine store would do better compared to a beer store?
Lots more
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:52:36
Will do, they are a certified trading agency through the UK trading system but still will keep my eyes peeled for stinky doings
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:51:33
Is the question will you be able to cash out 50BTC straight up? Depends on the services you have access to, Coinbase for example probably has a limit.
If its having too much BTC is a problem i can help you out :-)
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:19:50
I did create the deposit slip 2 hours before I went in so I'm not sure if that helped the process.
My verification is taking 3+ days now so that why i just pulled some cash out and walked into NAB
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:28:20
Yeah I've been watching this go up and up most of the day. I'm making more on the stock options than I am on btc (very late to the party)
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:04:47
Yeah of suggest this. You can't be the first person to destroy a USB stick this bad before
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:27:07
Well that's expected, you put a deposit it after regular banking times..
Do it during 9-5 would give you the better results (Not just BTC but any other banking processes etc)

Doubt they will sue, Apple would see it as a Privilege and not as a Right to host your Apps

A forensic data recovery company, the one I've used before charged about $5k to recover a destroyed hard drive. The drive had $20K of invoices stored on it.
Find someone who has no fix/no charge thing
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:13:29
You should it expect to be unexpecting.
Jokes aside, it could hit $10K in a few years which some predict could happen, or it could be worth 1c.
That's the fun part

The difficulty will jump a few more times and then it won't be making enough to cover your power
