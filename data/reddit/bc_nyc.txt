wish everything was sped up so these start ups can start operating with peace of mind. Can't wait!

no seriously, what is it that they do? there's no explanation on their website

I'd prefer it doesn't but Start up businesses, like the one I'm involved in are extremely cautious because of the fear of being fined by the state. By the rules being laid it, there's no more stifling of innovation
I wish we could operate without fear of regulation

like some replies here has said, they opened their doors Jan 1st this year and has a great place for bitcoin enthusiasts and developers to go and hang out.
I intern there helping out with their Sathosi Square trading events which is basically their own version of floor trading (pretty novel since its right next to the NY stock exchange).
 We've been having some bitcoin people and more importantly bitcoin newbs who want to know more and get bitcoins. We make it easy for them to do it since they usually haven't heard of coinbase or other websites where they can get bitcoins themselves.
If anyone is* in the area, they should definitely check it out on Monday 6pm-10pm for our live trading event.
**plus there's Open bar ;)**
pm me for whatever more info you wanna know
