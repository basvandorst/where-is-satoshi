There is not even a slight chance that the feds will let the FAA approve their application for delivering an illegal substance using drones. No fucking way!

I thought GBTC was supposed to launch last month. Why isn't trading active yet?

That concept of systematic thinking is something that I consider to be remarkably similar to that of the Socratic Method proposed by Socrates. 
1. We identify a statement
2. We imagine for a moment, despite the confidence of the person giving the statement, that the statement is false. We then proceed to identify situations and contexts where the statement is not true.
3. If an exception is found, then the statement must be false or at least imprecise.
4. Create a new statement while taking into account all the newly discovered fallacies.
5. If one finds additional fallacies in the statement, repeat this process.
So you see. The truth lies in a statement which seems impossible to prove. It is by finding out what something is not, that we truly discover what something truly is.

Many of things that we hold most valuable are physically tangible. Bitcoin is digitally tangible. So the question is, how do we obtain the same feedback from a tangible collectible as we can with Bitcoin. Physical coins? Vouchers? Those options are just not good enough imo. 
Maybe we need a marketing campaign focused on Bitcoin and morally good of it ONLY and/or crowd funded advertising.

Reselling on a 20% discount doesn't really generate profit when fees are over 15% on ebay. Then take into account the cost of shipping. You're making less than 5% if any...
