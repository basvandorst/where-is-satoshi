Some guy judging others' intentions is not a good reason.

What illegal activity?
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:44:35
How do you propose doing that?

The comments don't seem to really address your question.
The most common Bitcoin transaction is Pay-to-Pubkey-Hash. So that address (hash160) is the only thing known about your paper wallet to the network until you spend those funds (which reveals the public key for that address).

It is perpetual (constant) emission, so not exponentially increasing like one might expect from reading "perpetual inflationary policy".
Anyway, some things don't seem to work very well when emission runs out.

Doubling every four years is not 25% per year, it's ~19% per year.
Regardless, doubling on halving is strangely attractive, but is just as arbitrary as the 1MB limit in the first place. But hey, *if it gets consensus...*

No, the discount for witness data is so it can serve as a small "kick-the-can" scaling proposal in addition to the other stuff. It does allow easy signature pruning plus the potential on bootstrap sync sans old signatures, so some level of discount seems to have merit.
The adversarial case is unfortunately 2x worse than a 2 MB hard fork can-kick while the real scaling increase is probably 30% less, but it is what it is.

Why would a libertarian support an anti-free market hard cap on supply into perpetuity?

That site seems to say 10x that--50k+ satoshis--unless I'm reading it wrong.

Yes indeed. I've had good luck with it. Coinbase&lt;-&gt;Coinbase Exchange is instant too. (Coinbase Exchange BTC -&gt; Coinbase BTC -&gt;  your own wallet BTC takes ~1 minute or something)
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:43:38
Yup. If you use ACH -&gt; Coinbase USD wallet -&gt; Coinbase Exchange USD -&gt; limit order Coinbase Exchange BTC -&gt; Coinbase BTC -&gt; your personal wallet, you pay 0% fees; same for reverse case if you need that. It's slow at a couple points of course (some time for your limit order to get executed, lot of time for ACH to clear), but this is fine for some (many?) use cases.

Well no, you're neglecting the birthday problem. If you change it to "randomly generating X address", then you're probably right (though I didn't check your math, just 2^160).
@_date: 2015-10-09 18:42:52
There are no fees for ACH transfers at Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:05:31
No you didn't.

Your comparison is bad. You cannot count your entire car as part of your net worth because you don't own your entire car, just 70% of it. You also don't own your parents' assets. This isn't at all like SugMuhDig, who by his account does own the things he mentioned.
Liquidity is a distinct concept entirely, that's why we have terms like "net worth" versus "liquid net worth".

No sir. I've been using Coinbase Exchange as maker only for several months now. No fees anywhere if you don't mind waiting a ~week for your incoming transfer to clear (though strangely outgoing only takes 1-2 days) and waiting for someone to fill your order.
