your "self-respecting non-profit" label only applies to International NGOs (read: the ones in the fancy tax-free SUVs burning up our state-subsidized oil, congesting the city streets, pushing up rent, and living the life of a colonial rajah while pretending to "solve" our poverty for the last 25 years). Local NGOs that actually get work done in rural areas (no roads, walk for days to get to scattered mountain villages) have to bank locally. Or bitcoin it ;)
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:20:04
that's not happening. big name NGOs will not be affected (see my main comment). Red Cross will receive whatever you donate to them.  Mainly because they raise and bank most of their funds far far away from where they work.
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:13:04
yes, that was their initial "plan". due to the backlash from all sides, they have now watered it down. previously existing NGOs get to keep whatever funds they receive in their own accounts. only the newly registered earthquake specific NGO accounts will be seized and pooled into the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. Capital Controls have always been the harsh reality of Nepal.
on a related note, most of the monetary aid that various countries' leaders have pledged has NOT reached Nepal yet (day 10). afaik, the PM of Bhutan was the only one to arrive with a $1m in cash.

Your wikiquote applies to Thailand (Siam) as well. It had the same political scenario as Nepal: regional kingdoms struggling to dominate each other. European colonization of nearby regions and the growing power of neighboring States led to the unification of Nepal as well as Siam.
One measure of Sovereignty is the signing of treaties with European powers -- Nepal easily predates Thailand in this regard, having fought wars and made treaties with the British almost a century earlier.
If you compare dates on wikipedia, Siam, with its current geographical coverage, capital city, and royal dynasty came into being much later. Kathmandu is an ancient Hindu city. The region colonially named Siam was heavily influenced by Hinduism for centuries. Half of Thai names and words have Sanskrit roots. Nepali is the closest language to Sanskrit.
South Asia generally means Indian subcontinent or SAARC. Thailand (renamed thus in 1948) is in the South-East-Asian bloc aka ASEAN.
p.s. I &lt;3 Thailand :)

when will we get DotA?? imo that would be way better than LoL. mature, global, paying audience, look at dota tournament culture, LAN culture worldwide. lol is basically dota1.5 so get Dota2 on to leet.gg soon guys!

NEPAL is the oldest surviving State in South Asia. Yet its history isn't a tenth as horrendous as that of some north american colonies that were unified into a bunch of States during the same time period.
those temples that fell 10 days ago were built centuries before dear columbus even learnt to spell or sail!

great! allow me to point out that both of these organizations will convert crypto--&gt;fiat in the US. then they will use the usual existing bank channels to move money around.
@_date: 2016-06-12 09:01:51
lol they already are?
@_date: 2015-08-05 06:04:03
I dont think the receiver ever gets USD. Pretty sure no bank / money transfer co would do that. End user always gets local currency.

less than 250 MW by the entire network. the output of an average hydropower plant. compare that to the $cost of AC offices, ATMs, cars, planes, fancy suits, cash carrying armored trucks, support staff, occupation of prime real estate.. and all the other costs of legacy financial systems.

he could've used a script to post his replies within the specific time period/zone if he wanted to, or he could have been a weird time person elsewhere. it would help to know the time gap between questions and his replies, etc. since you guys are so keen on analysis :P

lol if you have about 100k usd in nepal, go see the hawala / hundi guys, plenty of em all around. bitcoin does not solve your problem at all. of course it solves a hundred million other things for our country, just not this. for smaller amounts, $20-100 try bitxnepal.com
