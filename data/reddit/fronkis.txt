What the fuck am I looking at?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:52:42
bittrex sucks
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:10
Nice, sell it
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:32:56
In the best interest of the *exchange*. Not the traders.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:16
1) Transaction times right now are taking up to several days, so the wait is normal.
2) Yes you will be charged $100, there is no reversing a transaction.
3) The fees are very high right now and you likely only bought $40 worth of bitcoin for $100. It is advisable to only move bitcoin in large amounts at the moment.
4) You can trade away the excess bitcoin once it arrives and get some of your money back.

Don't worry, when they add bcash to coinbase that shit will tank
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:21:42
In $30k debt here. Already made $500 in a week on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:08:59
Well yeah it probably isn't still usable for normal use, but wallet files are very small. As long as that part of the drive wasn't scratched it's recoverable, but you'll need to find a very sophisticated disk recovery service and it will likely cost hundreds, and there are no guarantees.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:41:36
Sorry man. In the future transfer everything to Gdax and trade there. There's no fees.

This is why litecoin is better
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:26
these passive-aggressive comments are even more threatening, and it's working lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:10:59
Aaaaand nothing happened 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:05
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:28:33
It's bitcoin futures. Not bitcoin cash futures, not bitcoin gold futures. Bitcoin futures.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:51:57
Litecoin is fast and low-fee

Forced hodl is best hodl
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:02:45
It just grows.
If it tanks on sunday when futures launch, don't sell it. Just hold onto it. It'll go back up. It's a small amount of money anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:27:05
Uhh exactly. They only care about themselves.
I stopped using Coinbase and switched to bitstamp+binance.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:50:50
Good luck, there are no buyers at that price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:28:24
All aboard the ripple train
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:06:02
It is really easy to brute force a wallet if you have the file 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:24
Didn't both of them get hacked at one point? And gemini has been stealing a ton of transactions? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:40:56
It's a bakers dozen after all
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:28:54
Assuming they bought in at like $14k they netted 72 million
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:29
That's what futures do. Read up on it - The purpose of futures is to hedge your risk. If you take a short position and the price goes up, you make money on the price increase and lose on your position, but it typically evens out - and vice versa.
The only thing futures will do is stabilize bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:06:40
huh? i bought my ripple on binance
you won't get fiat trading for most coins anywhere
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:43
Idk. My memory is hazy. Lots of shady exchanges. I'll be doing research.
Regulated exchanges aren't necessarily better. AML alerts can just disappear your money forever.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:57:34
I demand a trial by combat
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:10
Yeah, I'm officially moving off coinbase after this shit storm.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:28:17
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:18
Honestly, I think the only reason it's up is because people are moving so many altcoins to sell them right now. The bitcoin dip is good for it but once the supply dries up... eh
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:50
Confirmed by who? Get this sensational bullshit off the sub
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:37
Trading is frozen
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:42:41
Why do you dislike electrum?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:04
Bye Dimon
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:15:19
If you look closely, the buys were precisely at the launch of futures. I imagine that the people who were expecting a crash bought in once they saw it wasn't going to.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:08
And where's your source?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:36:01
Your post history is like a time machine
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:29:43
The only thing affecting password strength is length. A computer does not care what the characters are or how random. As far as brute forcing is concerned, "123456" is just as secure as "aU3
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:02
Chill my dude. Welcome to the rollercoaster. Your timing was a little off, but it happens.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:12:30
If you have the wallet file and its not multisig/2fa you don't need the private key. You can just put it in a container and brute force the password. Coworker found his old doge wallet a few days ago and did just that. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:57:59
We are groot
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:16:11
And now much bitcoin did you get? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:27
Whoa whoa hold on there. How did it break, and what have you tried? There is still a chance.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:27
Futures != shorting. Where did you get your MBA?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:20:56
Nobody is controlling the market
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:20
I mined roughly a dozen in 2012, and formatted the drive... then threw it out because it started clicking.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:15
They can't
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:31
What'd you buy at?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:41:12
Really though. The best home mining rigs can't reap profit for several months. And by then, the difficulty will have increased exponentially. It's a losing game unless you own a datacenter.

It pays to be calm during the storm
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:38:27
I made my first bitcoin purchase during the dip :D
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:32:50
I suppose, but then taxes..
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:05:37
working for me
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:52:06
sorry but, how? can you day trade bitcoin? like if you sell some on coinbase is the money immediately available to rebuy?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:45:34
Quality shitpost 10/10
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:54:57
You need a coinbase account, a phone, and a bank account/debit card.
