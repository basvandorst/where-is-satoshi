The only thing I can't understand is why they are picking such easily refutable things to troll about it. They must be new.
@_date: 2012-04-10 16:34:01
It's being downvoted by admission of genesis_block / LaCanner / Coinbitz / BLEAOURGH just because they don't like me + they are jealous + they think that BitcoinMagazine = Matthew, when it's actually a very large group. It doesn't matter though because only retards use Reddit and actually take it seriously.

I'm so happy that she is taking such a liking to Bitcoin. She's participating in the Satoshi Superstar competition right now (on the opposite team from me though -_-;) and planning on a really cool website release this month that will be a first of its kind.
Just wanted to give a shout out to my biggest fan sockpuppets genesis_block / LaCanner / Coinbitz / BLEAOURGH. Your comments always bring a smirk to my face since I directly correlate people's ridiculous claims against me as being a sign of my success. It happens every time I make something new and interesting. And every time I succeed with what I am doing, people are forced to change their stance in order to keep up with me.
@_date: 2012-04-10 23:05:44
Please message her on Facebook and let her know your thoughts. She is only interested in helping Bitcoin so I am sure she wants to hear what people have to say about what she is doing and how they are receiving it. It's important to her as a Korean teen as well that we show her what we as an international society what we do and do not support.
Some trolls here might bash me for having let her know about Bitcoin, but it's important that the those living outside Asia understand that models like her are all over Japan and Korea. The culture is much different here and if we as a market don't want something, we have to let her know directly.

Shut up fag.

Aww. Is baby jealous that baby doesn't know any cute Asian models? I recommend Bruce Wagner's Pattaya Party Package. You may not come back with a girl, but boy--- That's the end of my sentence.

So basically you (a sock puppet account of an SA goon), are up in arms against me personally for what you feel I am, and yet you cannot provide a single shred of proof for anything you claim? You say I have scammed, but I've never scammed. You say I'm a pedo, but that doesn't even -make any sense- as a pedo wouldn't even be attracted to someone who is 17 you idiot. And wouldn't a sexual predator actually need to have sex with someone for them to be a victim?
Here is why I don't take you seriously: If you were -actually- serious with your claims, you would be reporting me to authorities immediately. Yet, you just use a sock puppet account to slander all day long on reddit and never go into any specific details. This is why you'll never get my attention for anything but a laugh and a counter-troll.

Ah so the new Tesla doesn't exist and no engineers are working on it because it hasn't come out yet? Interesting. Tell me more about your lack of understanding of the development and release process.
@_date: 2012-04-10 21:48:45
I have two accounts on Reddit, and I've only used one to post here. You're seeing a frantic weasel trying to defend himself, when in reality it's just a bunch of other people who hate you, and me mocking you. So you're first major point is wrong. -1
I do not discuss issues seriously with sock puppets who carry no evidence with what they say or even "discuss". You have done nothing but slander-- up until this moment, which is why I'm responding to you. Second point about me, wrong. -1
Ms. Yoon was doing modeling long before I met her (read:  she just wasn't doing it for bitcoins. The only thing that has changed since meeting me is that she wants to help Bitcoin. I am very happy that she decided to learn about the bitcoin community as it's an awesome way to monetize on your talents internationally with the least boundaries. Now as with most goons, your reasoning for thinking things is not always unfounded (as I'm sure there are many people in the world doing many bad things), but your pissing into the wind hoping to hit a fly doesn't work with me because I'm not what you think I am. Your point was wrong. -1
She does not think of me as a celebrity in any way shape or form. The only thing I help her with is explanations of Bitcoin in Korean. Why don't you ask her yourself what she thinks of me, and show her what you say here and ask her what she thinks of you too while you're at it. Wrong again. -1
You call me a predator with no proof or reason, you call me a con-man with no proof or reason. It is obvious slander, and you're an obvious goon with a sock puppet. I'm not going away, so either start coming up with something a bit better to slander with (Maybe I rape seals and steal cookies from girl scouts too!) or expect to be met with an equal amount of ignorance in proportion to your posts. (I.e. Me trolling the trolls)

I totally support Bitlasers.com and will be purchasing my Arctic spyder from them.
@_date: 2012-04-10 15:09:17
I don't think it's such a big deal. All the economists who already formed opinions and who will form opinions aren't going to change their minds for social reasons (except the ones that translate to more money in their pocket), and the social nerd culture in America is stronger and more vibrant than ever-- it'd be ridiculous to not spread Bitcoin to teenagers. If you're a teen interesting in Bitcoin, you might appreciate contacting Yoon Yeonghwa. 
@_date: 2012-04-06 04:06:00
Lawl. Keep trolling fag.
@_date: 2012-04-10 16:07:28
BLEAOURGH and genesis_block (sockpuppets) agreeing on something? How odd and unexpected! ;)
@_date: 2012-04-10 22:25:28
I respond because it's fun to argue over the internet. Also because you are apparently in need of an education as you are so gravely wrong. You know the "I can't go to sleep yet! Someone on the internet is wrong!" guy? That's me. Try not to read too much into it, I'd do it to anyone. If you were in front of me I'd argue just the same. Arguing is fun, it builds skills, and it's a great way to learn about what others think about you so that you can fix yourself if you choose to. Isn't that obvious?
Now to the point, never scammed anyone. Where is your proof? Never conned anyone regardless of age. Where is your proof? Also can't say I'm much of a pedo either, as I think I'd throw up even thinking about such things. Where is your proof, and do you even know what that word means? Anyone with any sense at all will know this is just vulgar attempts at character assassinations with lame, poorly prepared throwaways. *Yawn*

Hold on, I'm not done masturbating at all these lonely people who obviously can't stop thinking about me. Keep trolling faggots..... UNG~ Awww yeah.

I'm defensive? This is how I have fun. :(
@_date: 2012-04-10 16:21:31
You're not trolling hard enough yet, sock puppet. Every post you've made in your 3 day old account has all been in threads related to me, all posting (baseless) accusations against me for some fruit loopage. 
No one cares who you really are or what your opinion is. They care about producing valuable products and services, and that is why I have so many fans. Unlike you who has to hide, I succeed by being myself and constantly producing. Doesn't it just bother you so much that there is absolutely nothing you can do to get in my way of being productive and creative and that I'm much more original than you'll ever be?  ^ _^ 
@_date: 2012-04-10 22:15:13
Yep. Same person or group of organized persons with a concentrated effort and shared bias. "Hey guys, let's go fuck around on reddit!". As if this wasn't a well known and common occurrence on reddit that SA goons will downvote things just because they have the word "Bitcoin" in them or because they are posted by someone they don't like as a hive mind.
Redditors are constantly complaining about this problem on Reddit, and it's kind of why I think of reddit as a joke (until they fix it).
@_date: 2012-03-13 16:34:09
WOW! Charts! And feeds! Shut up and take my money!
@_date: 2012-04-10 23:50:09
And just because you say it's right doesn't make it so. We've now come full circle.
Your mental acrobatics and wild imagination are entertaining and you admit yourself that you are arguing my supposed intentions. Good luck with that!
As for what was advertised, please go back to your "evidence" list ( and find the part where anyone announced a deadline and made it sound like to anyone that the magazine was 100% completed. You really have nothing, and it's getting boring.
"If these posts are so inaccurate and unfounded then why continue?"
Aww. So you want me to ignore you? Okay then. I thought we were having fun, but have it your way.

At 09:25:29 AM, another user by the name of DBordello had mentioned the potential for the title to be misconstrued and the issue was resolved within minutes. The topic was changed to "raffle" to make it absolutely clear what was being offered.
Your post was at 11:14:00AM complaining about a title that then didn't exist, barking about your disagreement with raffles and mislabeling it a "Ponzi" scheme, then later retracting it, and blaming the entire community for "supporting ponzi schemes" due to their support for this honest raffle for a Bitforce Single.
So far everything you based your 'points' on, you yourself have retracted. So I just have to ask..
U mad bro?
@_date: 2012-04-10 17:33:03
Yoon Yeonghwa is a scamming pedo creeper? That doesn't even make any sense.
@_date: 2012-04-05 16:18:29
Herp derp. how 2 engrish? Btw, I was wondering why you faggots don't just post on the forums more often, but I guess you're the filth that I hear about called "reddit". Thank god I finally started posting here. I was getting bored without people constantly talking about me. So what's new with me?
@_date: 2012-04-10 16:44:16
Forgive me if I can't take you seriously right now in between laughing at you, but your inability to understand the definition of the word "fact" or "pedo" combined with an inability to elaborate on your points in the slightest leads me to believe you're handicapped and incapable of presenting any kind of argument worth listening to. It is a fun show though, especially since everyone has already picked up the sock puppet pattern of yours and votes everything you say down. ^ _^ 
Don't stop the show! It gives me a reason to come to Reddit. What will you do when  I am pumping out original ideas and creating fans on Reddit as well as the forums? Move to another social network and slander there instead? Hehe.
@_date: 2012-04-10 22:55:45
Let's dissect your argument (since you seem to actually believe you're right).
Have you ever heard of a pre-order? That's what we offered, and the community was happy to oblige, because it's a major (and very interesting if I do say so myself) project that will benefit Bitcoin greatly as a whole. Although I love criticisms, blanket criticisms are allowed to be disregarded. "This magazine is a scam" is not a criticism. "They shouldn't have offered a pre-order" is an opinion. "I don't think it is a wise business decision to accept pre-orders" is critical advice that I would listen to. Learn to speak. As for not delivering, we haven't "not delivered". That would imply we have declined the ability or intent to deliver, instead of the truth, which is to do a good job on the product, set up the system to efficiently manage in the future, and to make every effort to streamline the process before releasing. That makes me a smart businessman who obviously cares about the magazine's quality over what a handful of impatient pre-order customers think. You really have no argument here for scamming.
Pretty much everything else you said was completely bullshit, fabricated and obvious fishing for details that you can twist and contort and slander some more. You made the following false statements:
1) You convinced a teenagegirl to dress in her panties
2)  You have been making videos of it
3) You are a sexual predator
4) You are a certain type that I can easily diagnose over the internet.
5) You prey on ignorance and cover it with lies once detected.
Wrong. Where did I lie? You're the only one lying right now. You might actually think you're causing some good in the world by doing it, you maybe thing you're going to get me to admit to something that will magically spell me out as a seal raping, cookie stealing pedo, but you're just wrong wrong wrong and it's hilarious hilarious hilarious to watch you stabbing in the dark.
6) You have admitted to having more than one account.
Wow! One correct! And I haven't even used it to post in the past 3 months either! Interesting how you talk about "distraction" and "deflection" yet you can't explain how 100% of your activity on reddit since your account was created 3 days ago is all about slandering me.
I love you too sweetheart. ;)
@_date: 2012-01-25 02:33:44
You failed to explain the reason in your p-- oh I get it now.
@_date: 2012-06-03 10:18:40
Not sure if they were able to deliver a magazine in the bubble you live in, but if so, please post constructive criticisms there. Thanks!

@_date: 2012-04-05 16:35:58
That's funny, the last time I was checked in at immigration with my F-2-2 visa I'm pretty sure they said I could come in. Are you saying that they aren't doing their job? Why don't you call them and let them know. That would be an uneventful conversation to say the least.
"Hey guys, there's this guy on the internet I really don't like, and he's obviously making more money than I am and having way more sex than I am, could you guys do something to stop him please?"
@_date: 2012-04-10 14:10:30
