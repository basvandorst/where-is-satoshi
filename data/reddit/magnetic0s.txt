Yes, exactly! This is what was nagging at me: if all the addresses already exist and bitaddress.org just picks one at random, then how do you know you don't pick one that's already in use? But as you say, chances of that happening are so unfathomably small that it's not a factor. Shuffling a deck of cards will already give you so many unique combinations that no two same sequences will ever be drawn before the heat-death of the universe. Probability for same blockchain addresses is another 1e10 smaller.

Thanks. What confuses me about that is that as soon as I generate an address I'm able to look it up on blockchain.info and see that it indeed exists and has a balance of 0 BTC. This tells me that there's some form of data exchange between my computer and the blockchain already.

I can search for an address I just generated and it shows up on blockchain.info with balance zero.
I've tried changing one or two characters in the address and then blockchain.info gives me a different result (can't find the address at all).
It's not that I don't believe y'all :) Just that I haven't yet wrapped my head around it. Do appreciate the help!

Thanks fellas / fellettes, clear to me now!

So this is the thing that I'm stuck on. If there's no data exchange between my computer and the blockchain, how is it possible that I can look up an address that I just generated but did not transfer coins to?
