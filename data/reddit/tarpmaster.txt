Just a twisted individual having some twisted fun.  Amazing how many people are lining up to receive stolen funds.  Sad.

Nope.  I'm not. Most everybody leaving their BTC address for this guy believes this is the BFX hacker handing out stolen funds.

I was with you until you called is simply a speculative gamble.  We're not playing poker here.  There is some logic behind the "investing."  By the way, I own zero bitcoin, of any flavor.

It’s very simple:
1) How much did you make last year?
2) Send it in.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:11:22
But you will never really know if it is fine.  It’s like changing the locks on a house you just moved into.  It’s just something you do to rest easy.  A new hardware wallet is cheap insurance.

There is no US war on crypto
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:39:29
Because there are many other "investments" out there that also have a promise of strong returns for the investor.  The investor is faced with choosing the vehicles that will give them the best return based on their desired risk profile.  Asking a "millionaire" to invest 1% of their investment portfolio is a big ask.  That is way more money than most will spend on a highly volatile, speculative asset.  One of the most common illusions in the business world is the promise of how grand life would be if we could only get a tiny piece of that market (name your market).  The fabric manufacturer who has 20% market share in China dreams that the average length of all shirt sleeves will increase by 1 inch.
Maybe BTC will gain this kind of investment share in the future but it has a lot of competition, not the least of which are the other crypto projects that also make similar promises.  It's not a foregone conclusion in the average investor's mind that BTC will be the clear winner.

I can’t believe you are still having this conversation.  Unless you don’t plan to have much on it.

I have a 6 month contract with Megamine.  Seems legit.  Does anybody have any experience with them?

I had the new app and decided to just go to Coinbase from Safari.  Works much better.  I have 3 accounts on Coinbase.  The app wouldn't allow me to access all 3 accounts easily.

You couldn’t be more wrong.  Buffet is definitely anti-bitcoin and even called it rat poison. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 07:28:12
Agreed.  I once did a search and found out I had some utility security deposit out there.  They sent me a check for it.

No.  As Rockefeller said when asked, "How much is enough?"  Answer:  "A little bit more."

That's no challenge.  She should have challenged you to SNORT it without making a face.  Saw a guy do that in the Jackass movie.  He immediately puked.

I never once cried when an investment I turned down does well.  You win some, you lose some.  I have plenty of winners. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 01:16:05
That's awesome advice.
@_date: 2018-11-04 18:54:25
This seems more like a decision around breach of contract rather than supporting crypto.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:25:14
If you make money primarily through trading, you are exempted in the U.S. from paying tax on every trade.  That is a high hurdle though.

That’s a lot of TLA’s.  (Three letter acronyms)
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:49:03
I know this feeling.  I have gotten a bit lucky in crypto and I sort of fear it will all go away.  However, to cash out of any crypto to put into some other traditional investment seems so unappealing and feels like I would be giving up so much potential.  I keep staring at the light and I can't stop!
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:19:33
You need to account for capital gains tax of 15% if holding vs ~30% if you don't. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:56:44
In the U.S., crypto is treated like property, just like securities.  You must pay tax on all realized capital gains (meaning you sold something for a profit).  If you hold a security for more than 12 months, you pay a lower tax rate of 15% (20% in rare cases) vs your normal tax rate which is around 30%, depending on your personal tax situation.  Most people here don't even think about that as they flippantly go in and out of the market, buying and selling, but you need to figure that into your profit picture.
If you don't track and report your trades to the IRS, you are playing with fire.  It is foolhardy to say "they can't track it."  You might get away with it for a year, 2 yrs or 10 yrs but if you get caught, it can ruin your life.  I, for one, don't want to be looking over my shoulder the rest of my life.
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:45:07
I think the chance that he's telling the truth is less than 50%.  Most people who are "millionaires" don't shout it from the rooftops.  I just find his post humorous.  It's sort of like watching a funny video that you know is staged or fake.  If you don't call it out as fake, you might actually be entertained by it.  Who knows?  He might have the biggest dick in town.  Edit:  typo
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:25:18
Maybe he rebalances to 25% every year.  Don't judge him because he has more faith in bitcoin than you.  You do you.  Don't rain on his parade. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:13:05
Wary, not weary.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:02:11
He's not scared of bitcoin or blockchain.  Maybe he should be but he's not.  Banks are generally condescending when it comes to blockchain. They don't see it as a threat to their world.  They will "study it," join the associations, do the token sponsorships (no pun intended), keep their toes in the water for when they have to react in 5 years.  Their world, however, is about to be disrupted. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:25:59

I don't believe everything I read.

Seems you're not the one doing it wrong.  
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:09:27
In The U.S. crypto is treated like property, just like securities (e.g., stocks or bonds).  It is not recognized as currency.  If you exchange crypto for currency, it is as if you sold it and you must, therefore, pay the tax on the gains (or net the losses).  It doesn't matter where you sell it.  You must report foreign income as well as domestic income.

No, I think I understood him.  He says it is guaranteed that alts will be worth less (doesn't matter if it's in relation to bitcoin or fiat).  Nobody can guarantee that.  In fact, I think there is a good chance that an altcoin will one day be more valuable than BTC.  I know that comment in a bitcoin sub will get me downvotes but we should be intellectually honest with ourselves.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:49:42
Sure you can.  But that doesn't change your tax liability.  I don't even have to travel to Europe to do that.  I pay my taxes so I can sleep like a baby and not go through life like a fugitive.  Everybody here pays their taxes, right?
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:36:20
I've heard that you can but I would expect that the IRS will still hold you responsible for any taxes due if you ever want to visit the U.S. again and they may have a reciprocal agreement with whatever country you want to join.  Also, I don't know anyone who would renounce their U.S. citizenship over a 6-figure amount of money.  I suppose where there's a will to avoid taxes, there's a way.  People do it all the time.  That's not something I'm interested in.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:10:12
Yes, it is frustrating.  Imagine having to keep track of every use of BTC.  That is what we are expected to do.  With that constraint, it is not practical to use BTC as money for everyday purchases.

Hi there,
I’m very sorry for the trouble with this. Our team is on the case and is in the process of pushing out a fix for this vault issue. No funds are at risk here and we should have this resolved soon. Thanks for your patience!

I have seen BTC for sale on Bitfinex $30 less than what Counbase was charging at the time. I wanted to buy some from Bitfinex but I had no way of cheaply getting dollars to Bitfinex.  I could do it with Tether but I just don't have the confidence in it right now, especially since it was recently in beta.  Still might be.  That is an example of a use case for Tether.

Yes, these transactions are difficult to track but the IRS will expect you to do so.  I keep track of all my Shapeshift and Ripple transactions.  I am in the U.S.

Exchanging for other assets (such as other crypto) is also a taxable event.  It is not only to fiat.

Good point.  And a very important point.  Upvoted.  However, cannot a large bank like JP Morgan achieve critical mass quickly?  Bitcoin's network is not that large compared to the likes of JP Morgan or Wells Fargo.  Of course, there would be some ramp-up time.  In that regard, Bitcoin has earned its stripes.  But a big bank could do the same.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:39:11
Ignorance is no defense.  They won't go to jail but they will have to pay, if caught, and could pay penalties.  The IRS has published clear guidance on this issue.
