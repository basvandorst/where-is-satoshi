Block chain can be slow sometimes. I'm guessing that.
@_date: 2012-11-07 02:47:16
Oh, shit. It did?
@_date: 2012-09-05 11:16:00
I'm still amazed how the bet went that high. I'm struggling to earn more than 3 BTC while some people must have thousands of dollars' worth.
@_date: 2012-11-12 01:06:52
Oops, I meant &gt;48000. Sorry. Didn't notice until now.
@_date: 2012-11-11 06:25:24
Shit dude.
Based on your reply to jvgh111, you're fucked. Find that USB ASAP.

FIAT currencies have never stood the test of time. Government-backed money is doomed to fail. Not accepting a decentralized currency when it is, in fact, a currency is ridiculous.

35,000? How...?
@_date: 2012-11-07 04:34:23
It enables laundering. Gov't can't shut it down if they don't know where it's located.
Besides, I love Onionland.
@_date: 2012-09-06 02:40:50
Care to elaborate?

The first question is related to the second two.
There is a Bitcoin laundry named Bitcoin Fog which is a Tor Hidden Service. Hidden Services are anonymous and pretty secure websites encrypted end-to-end in the Tor network.
Fog allows you to deposit Bitcoins to an address. It mixes the Bitcoins between many people using Fog and eventually sends the BTC to an address specified by you, disguising the origin of the Bitcoins. You can read more on Bitcoin Fog's clearnet address (bitcoinfog.com).
You can always just create an address that hasn't been used by the Blockchain and use that...

Ouch. Sorry to hear, I had no idea. This one seems to be working fine. I'm testing it as we speak.
@_date: 2012-11-11 22:20:36
I'll never understand why people would go with anything but &lt;32000 on huge bets like this. 75% to win, and he would've gotten a 335 BTC payout.
@_date: 2012-11-12 01:45:29


So, "I don't agree with you; therefore, how can anyone else"?


You have a better outcome of 75% versus 50%. And you still make a huge profit in the end.

Very little information given... Do you use a different password for everything? Was it comprised of random characters? Are you sure you didn't write it down?
@_date: 2012-11-07 00:01:38
We already have [TORwallet]( but the more the merrier, I suppose. Nice to see more Hidden Services popping up.
EDIT: Replied to the thread. I'll be testing it.

IP is localhost. Make your password something random as well. Problem pretty much solved. E-mail really isn't that big of a deal depending on the provider and what you're using it for.
Edit: still thinking Mullvad is the best VPN. Personal opinion though.
@_date: 2013-01-09 01:56:24
Correct answer. onion.to and tor2web are shady as fuck and you have no way of knowing what they log and what they can do.
@_date: 2013-01-25 20:58:35
@_date: 2013-01-25 20:58:48
Talk about being loaded. Dude...
@_date: 2013-01-27 01:53:16
Tormail. If you're too lazy to download Tor and boot it up each time to get to the service, then you can try hushmail or trashmail.

What I would give to have almost $18,000...
@_date: 2013-01-17 22:14:37
I had no idea, but now that I do, I'm definitely going to send BTC from time to time. He deserves every bitcent.
