First they ignore you,
Then they laugh at you,
Then they fight you,
Then you win

Good answer Chinawat, I'd tip you my only $0.10 I have in changetip, however the ball seems to have started to roll with someone asking if usd fails how will we know the price, so instead im gona hang onto it...when yhe time comes il use it to buy you a lifetimes supply of eggs :-)

I'm usually just a reddit lurker and been watching/partaking in bitcoin since they where $7, unfortunately back then I was broke so only bought a few to play with(I like to call it recessionised) but I hada make an account for this thread.
Its also my first ever changetip so thankyou, I will continue my reddit account and pass it on

Kiisfm - I agree with you there buddy, 'c'mon you fucks, go to my website and buy my shit'...Just say it already Joe! Lol.
As the top comment says he has another podcast I suggest anybody watching the live stream calls him out on not accepting bitcoin / his commercialism. He says he only does podcasts on what interests him etc, prove that your not just after viewers so you can plug you website Joe, I originally liked the guy but the tide is turning after seeing the bs

I love the way he thinks its just money, when its a programmable code that just so happens to ack as money atm, in the future it can (imo will) be a number of things. Have an upvote buddy :)

Im going to have to alter your last line to:
It's just digital fucking money....for now.
Thats like saying in 1995, email/internet is just digital fucking letters...do me a favour, look beyond the present once in a while, with your kinda attitude how would anything progress. Bitcoin/blockchain technology is one big experiment, and forgive me if im wrong but doesn't it seem to be doing quite well overall? Grab a dictionary and look up the word innovation my friend

Wasn't Andreas selling a signed copy of this book for like $6 or $7's?. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;THIS is why bitcoin is king, how many middlemen are taking a lucrative cut out of this $20 price tag...I should of bought from Andreas' tweet when I seen it.
Id take a signed copy of the bible signed by Jesus,
I should've bought Andreas' signed copy when I saw it
Edit - missing word

I've already done something like this a few weeks back, his 2nd podcast with Andreas, Joe had said he should accept bitcoin as a payment option on his website Higherprimate.com(?), it didn't a few weeks back so I sent them an email asking if they would/will...2 weeks later a response from some guy saying the won't.
I don't wana sound like I'm hating on Joe, but backup your words man is all I'd like to say, it just seems to me he's full of hot air
