There are actually two Bitcoin ATM's going online in Austin tomorrow, one at HandleBar and the other at [Central Texas Gun Works]( (They also take BTC for Firearms).
Many members from the  [Austin Bitcoin Meetup]( will be at HandleBar tomorrow for the "Grand Opening" at 2pm, but if the line is too long or it gets too crowded, the Gun Store should be a viable alternative, and arguably more convenient to access than 5th Street in Downtown Austin. I'd call to make sure they have everything setup before you head out there though.
Many of the organizers from the [Texas Bitcoin Conference]( will also be there, so if you find one of us make sure to ask about the big discount codes we have for the conference.

I booked a room in Denver this week and paid with Bitcoin, but I was still required to use a Credit card when checking in for a room deposit or they wouldn't let me have the room (regardless that it was already paid for).
I'll be much happier when I can pay for a room and check in without credit cards at all one day.

It's strange to me how much hates Bitcoin. 
The reason Handlebar wouldn't accept Bitcoin is because they claimed they couldn't get an answer from the TABC, and up until this point that may have been true. I've also heard the same response from Lanai on 5th and Congress about Bitcoin. 
This will all change very soon with this press release, and I anticipate Handlebar will be the first one. 
The Bitcoin hate doesn't actually extend very far into real Austin, and Bitcoin is a natural choice especially for bars that already accept TabbedOut. I know that TabbedOut has tested Bitcoin internally, and they've been effectively waiting for a statement like this to come out before rolling Bitcoin support out into their app. So we may see that suddenly a ton of bars start accepting Bitcoin without actually knowing they're doing it.

Turn off your internet connection and start up chrome so that it shows up again.
Back up your wallet at this point.
Go to your extensions manager and remove KryptoKit completely. 
Turn on your internet connection, and go to the KryptoKit plugin on the chrome store: 
It should now let you install it again.
Afterwards import your wallet (it's the "passcode" field in the backup you created in the step above).
You should now be good to go! :)
Edit: It seems that I'm seeing a whole new issue now however, as even though I can get it installed again, Chrome is still demanding to uninstall it without my authorization. Sigh.
Edit 2: Right now I've gone about 20 minutes without it demanding to be uninstalled, perhaps it's been resolved on my end by leaving my internet offline for 20-30 minutes, -crosses fingers-
Edit 3: Google just removed it again from my browser, so this still definitely hasn't been resolved on their end.
Edit 4: Should be all resolved now :)

That has been my assessment as well that I am trying to emphasize to the rest of the Texas Bitcoin Conference group. 
I have an unsettling feeling that this started out as a physical attack, with someone putting a "bad" usb stick into someone else's laptop at one of our weekly meetups -  .  God help them if we catch them in the act.
After this particular attack was caught, afaik the conference should have sent out emails to those who were affected. Could you email support with any details you have about the email you received?

You can continue to spread your disinformation and I will continue to educate people about your scams. Every single time you tell someone why I resigned, the reason changes, and you're unable to keep your story straight. Why won't you tell anyone that the reason the person who was supposed to replace me didn't want anything to do with the TBA was because of how you were treating people? 
The fact of the matter is that the community has done better than ever since you have been gone, and with our scheduled live speakers and partnering with the crypto radio show we really don't need you or your Brock Pierce/Mastercon money doing anymore damage than it already has. 
You continue to throw around this word "integrate" as if the Bitcoin meetup discriminates against people, but in reality the only person that isn't allowed to the meetups is **you**. 
Everyone else can continue to have free food and beer every weekend in a friendly environment without having to hear you screaming and shouting from the hallways.

You need to take your internet offline first, and then restart chrome, and it should be accessible again.
After that you need to uninstall it manually from your extensions manager (but make sure you have a backup of your keys first). 
Then when you turn your internet back on, you can restart chrome and you should be able to install it again.

I know the owner of Central Texas Gun Works, Michael.
As far as anyone knew, they were supposed to have the first ATM, but HandleBar came out of nowhere with their news (which is kind of upsetting since no one involved with them is part of the Austin Bitcoin community).
In fact there were several Austin news crews out at the gun store yesterday filming and doing stories about the "first Bitcoin ATM in the USA", and several minutes after they left the news about HandleBar broke so the footage that was shot will have to be edited to take that into account.
You can call them up and ask them about the ATM, which should be operational next week. So Austin will now have 2 Bitcoin ATM's :D
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:44:05
Both Bitcoin ATM's in Austin are Robocoin ATM's and use Facial Recognition for your initial account setup and verification. I'm not sure how other Bitcoin ATM's around the world work, but the concept isn't so far fetched.

Once again he is trying to pretend that other things didn't happen. So I will explain in full detail why **alanX** is not welcome at the meetups anymore, and although he will try to dispute this, I luckily saved every single email that he ever sent to I and others to be able to prove what it is I am about to tell you and everyone else here. 
In October of 2013 several of the members from the Austin Bitcoin Meetup decided to throw a Bitcoin conference, which we would call "The Texas Bitcoin Conference". However in order to do that, we needed a company to hold the money for the conference, so the "Texas Bitcoin Association" was started to handle the money for the conference.
Where did the money come to pay the attorneys fees to start the company? All of the money that was donated to the Austin Bitcoin Meetup was taken and spent on attorneys instead of being put back into the Austin Bitcoin Meetup as it was originally intended.
We had all originally agreed on a low price point for tickets, which was quickly inflated to $300-$350 per ticket. And our original price point for a venue skyrocketed when he insisted that the conference be held at the Circuit of Americas, and that a one day conference had to be a 2-day conference now.
Over time it dawned on me why the conference was pushed to 2 days, because it just so happens that Mastercoin was funding the contests going on. In order to guarantee that would happen, $40k in Bitcoin was donated to the association in sponsorship money by them, however ...
**alanX** claims that the $40,000 in Bitcoin that was given to the Texas Bitcoin Association in order to fund the Texas Bitcoin Conference 2013 was "lost", which happened conveniently when the issue of having to pay back the creditors came up...
To my surprise, two of us board members from the association were being denied access to any of the expense reports or spreadsheets detailing just how much money was spent on throwing the conference and where that money was going. What was originally billed as $200k conference ballooned into (and the number changes every time I hear it) as far as $750k, now anyone in their right mind would ask "How the hell did the Texas Bitcoin Conference cost three quarters of a million dollars???".
Seeing that **alanX** was spending money at an out of control rate, I and another board member decided it was in our best interest to get on paper that we were not liable for the debts that he was accruing without our authorization. So we have a meeting and it's agreed that we're not liable for the debts the association is racking up without any oversight (sound familiar?).
So while all of this money is being thrown around (that he doesn't have), **alanX** realizes that sponsors aren't going to cover the cost of the conference (which anyone would have been able to determine had they seen the spreadsheets which he refused to share). So he goes behind the board's back, and decides to reach out to none other than David Johnston with BitAngels (Mastercoin), Sam Yilmaz, and Brock Pierce (yeah, that Brock Pierce) to beg for money.
They agree, and here is the contract that proves what I'm saying:
In fact, here's David Johnston last week acknowledging that the contract is real: 
So **alanX** decides that since it's in the contract now that we're not liable for the money he's throwing around (which has far surpassed the money coming in at this point), that we should resign because we don't want to just cover his ass (and why should we have, he refused to even tell us what he was spending the money on). So I step up to resign first, and in doing so I want to transfer my shares of the association to another person, and since they were MY shares, I should have been able to do that in any way I felt appropriate (in that I wanted to give all of my shares to a single person).
He disagreed and decided that since I and another board member didn't want to just hand over all of our shares to him (going so far as to make comments like "Well are you going to pay for my new roof next year?!"), that he would sue us to force us out of the company instead. So he threatens to sue us for $200k, if we don't resign without giving up all of our shares. Later did I only discern that we were also forced out because the trio that bought 2 board seats decided they didn't want any opposition on the board to bad ideas. (Spending insane amounts of money without any records was a bad idea to me).
(Edit: I need to add here that the reason I was giving my shares to a specific person, was because this was someone that the board had previously unanimously voted on taking over my position, and it was someone I nominated for the role because I felt they would keep tabs on the Association so as to not soil the company name, and to prevent them from doing things like throwing $5k per seat dinners for legislators in Texas (which ended up happening after the events written here). When he realized that this person was going to have the same voting share as I did, **alanX** wanted to strip that power from them by taking all of my shares for himself so that he could continue doing what he wanted with a majority vote in the company without anyone telling him "no").
(Edit: I also want to point out at this point, that in my resignation contract, he tried to have a non-disclosure agreement in there so that I wouldn't be able to tell anyone about what happened. I argued against it and it was removed from the contract because I refused to sign it otherwise. I felt an obligation to be able to talk about what happened.)
Come to find out, that although I got the brute force of the negativity behind the conference, that several other volunteers from not only the Austin Bitcoin Meetup, but other meetups in Texas, also got burned or mistreated by **alanX** and his wife at the Texas Bitcoin Conference. I felt this was incredibly wrong, because the money that started the conference came directly from those very same volunteers and donators, and that if it wasn't for those people in the community, the conference would have gone even worse than it did. It's the people in the Bitcoin community that make Bitcoin, and mistreating them when they take time out of their daily lives to volunteer all day for your conference is very wrong. 
So to make a point of it, I sent the Texas Bitcoin Association a letter stating that they were no longer welcome at the Meetup for not only threatening to sue several of our members (who were board members) for money that he himself spent without any oversight, but also for mistreating the members that volunteered and for selling out the association to none other than Brock Pierce. To stress that this was the reason he wasn't welcome back anymore, I also made a point of telling him that he was welcome back for the low sum of $200k (it wasn't meant as a serious number, it was to make a joke of the fact that he tried to wrongly sue us for that same amount of money but of course that went over his head and he tells people that I tried to charge him money to attend the meetup which is only true if you're unable to process irony or sarcasm).
It would have been able to end peacefully there, but he started showing back up at the meetups and started spreading false rumors about I and others, and was generally trying to split up the group to kick anyone who disagreed with him out. Unfortunately for him, he didn't realize that most of the group could see what he was doing, and that nobody appreciated the drama he was trying to create. So as the founder of the meetup, I asked him to leave, because he was making people feel uncomfortable. Also because I didn't want anyone else to get sucked into another one of his debt pits again. 
Naturally he was understanding and agreed to leave right? Hardly. It ended with him screaming at I and another person at the Bookstore (you could hear him shouting from the hallways), and ultimately being asked to leave by the store staff because he was creating a scene. 
And we haven't seen him at the meetups since.
Even Phinnaeus Gage , referred to as the "most interesting person in bitcoin", has posted his opposition to **alanX** after he discovered what was going on during his digging into Brock Pierce and company: 
 
etc. etc.
tl;dr - what **alanX** is saying is true only if you leave out huge important details from the story. He was asked not to come back for creating unnecessary drama, and so that I could protect the other meetup members from what he had already gotten away with against several other of our members. Nobody is telling him he can't have his own meetup, and I'm not telling anyone not to attend his meetups, but I think people should know the truth and make that decision for themselves. 
I may have missed a detail or two, but certainly not on purpose, and I will elaborate on whatever is necessary if something is missing here. I will also gladly provide records of these conversations and all to prove what I am saying as well.
Edit: Typos, although there are likely many more.

You should use the one at central Texas gun works to see how they differ in user experience, since they are owned and run by different people with different rates. 
The one at Dominican Joe's is owned by the same guys who own the handlebar one so I assume the rates are the same.
I heard they do about $10k in sales a day, but I didn't catch how much people are selling everyday.

Yup, that's what I did. 
I also had to restart my computer, because Chrome kept insisting that it needed to remove the plugin without my permission even after I re-installed it.
Not sure why that is, but I don't really feel like digging into it and a quick reboot is an easy fix.

Some of the early models would dump a windows command prompt in administrator mode if you tapped the bottom right corner of the screen five times very quickly.
When I pointed this out to the owner of the establishment, so that he would shut down the machine and get the issue resolved with ATM owners (who in turn would have gotten in touch with RoboCoin to resolve the problem), he accused me of trying to steal money, that he didn't appreciate me bothering him and told me to never come back. 
So I don't use that Bitcoin ATM anymore. Luckily we have 3 in Austin to choose from, so the loss of not having to find parking downtown to use the ATM there wasn't really so bad.

It was around 0.006 BTC or so, that's not me in the picture though so I don't know the exact amount. 
Edit: It was 0.008 BTC as confirmed [here](

Gavin didn't seem too thrilled by OT's Contract based system during his state of the Bitcoin 2014 talk. 
On the other hand, I don't think Gavin has actually ever taken a look at the OT source code.

I was featured in this documentary (pretty easy to guess which one I am).  I haven't said anything about it on Reddit because I wasn't sure how it would be, but I think I'm pleased with how it turned out.
I quit my Senior Systems Engineer job at HP to go work for Monetas developing projects (Voting Pools) utilizing [Open Transactions]( (We're hiring, if you're in Europe give me a shout!). As of the first of this year I have been paid in Bitcoin, and I live day to day as much as possible off my BTC (Taxes next year are going to be... interesting.).  
I'm the founder of the [Austin Bitcoin Meetup]( and more recently I was one of the organizers behind the Texas Bitcoin Conference (I was on the panel you see me on in the documentary with Andreas and Chris Odom). 
I'm not "Bitcoin Famous" or anything, nor do I want to be or expect to ever be, but I am extremely happy to be fortunate enough to be a small part of this whole community. I write code for a living in a language that I love, C++ (I know, most people hate it), I get paid in Bitcoin, and I get to be around people that I look up to and learn from constantly. Next month I'll be in Switzerland for a few weeks, hopefully working with the Ethereum guys too.  
I get to be cyberpunk for a living :)

Nope, but we'll elaborate more on that here in the future very shortly.

Here in Austin I've had issues on numerous occasions with the Bitcoin ATM's, however the contact information for the operators are pasted right on the front of the machine so I've been able to get on the phone with them immediately to resolve situations.
 should be a model to other Bitcoin ATM operators out there on how to do support for their customers.

There is no Altcoin in Open Transactions.

Anonymity in the communications, plausible deniability is a plus, and deterministic channels is extremely important.
The ability for us to generate an address for a  channel deterministically is probably the most important requirement. Which is why we can't use things like Tox, where the developers laughed me out of their IRC room when I asked about having such a feature (they went off on things like "Buttcoiners" wanting those features). 
I think there is some confusion over the security of a deterministic address. In BitMessage having a deterministic address that is used temporarily is perfectly okay because the messages only exist on the network for a short period of time (3 days), and the content we would send over is encrypted anyways despite the encryption BitMessage already provides.

As an Open-Transactions developer, we are using the platform daily in our development. I mainly work on the desktop wallet, [Moneychanger]( which of course requires the backend to be functional. 
It's very easy to build OT on Linux and Mac, Windows is a platform I'm unfamiliar with developing on so I can't speak as to the ease of building it there. 
Documentation on using OT can be somewhat terse to get through, and easing it will be a focus area moving forward.
@_date: 2015-09-11 19:35:26
My last commit most definitely wasn't 4 months ago -&gt; 
Open Transactions is stable enough that we are focusing on building tools that use Open Transactions rather than just adding to the platform as we were in the past.
We are also continuing to work on Open Transactions as necessary to fix issues we come across when building our tools. But as you can see, we haven't had to do that lately (which is a good thing).
Monetas is no longer affiliated with Open Transactions.

BitMessage has its place within Voting Pools, but it's not a necessary requirement for Open Transactions. Even within Voting Pools we are looking for better solutions than BitMessage, and I am eager to hear about any suggestions anyone has.

I posted the story of my horrible experience with MtGox here before, but it went relatively unnoticed...
Sometime last year MtGox account was deleted, without any notifications being sent to me, or any notifications that my lack of activity (ie, not logging into their site for a few months) would lead to my account being deleted.
I was especially irritated that they would delete my account even when there was money still in it, and it's unacceptable (at least in my opinion) that they would do it without notifying me or giving me any warning in advance.
It took almost 3 MONTHS after I discovered my account was deleted (from December to March) before their support finally un-deleted my account and put the money back in it. I have all of the communications between myself and their support staff over that period saved as well. 
Can you imagine if a bank deleted your checking account because you hadn't logged into their website in a few months, and then shrugged you off for 3 months when you came in asking what happened to your money?
It's clear to me that they absolutely do not give a shit about their customers. I mean, read the [press release]( about their "crash" last night, it's just them patting themselves on the back for fucking up the entire market. If they really had our best interests in mind, they would have notified their users something was up last night. We didn't need specifics, we just needed to know that there was an issue taking place, communication is part of customer support.
Frankly, I believe MtGox has got to go. We need an exchange run by people who know customer support, and [MtGox is never going to learn how to do that right.](

A thousand BTC to the person who develops a p2p database with write speeds on par with current databases (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite,  Mongo, whatever).
Distributed p2p databases with incredibly fast speeds would change the dynamic of the web as we know it. Unfortunately most, if not all, of the work is theoretical and proof-of-concept. There's just not too many people out there with a huge interest in writing database software (I don't blame them).

I don't read too many complaints about MtGox, so perhaps I'm alone in my experience... 
My MtGox account was deleted, without any notifications being sent to me, or any notifications that my lack of activity would lead to my account being deleted.
Their support is absolutely horrendous, and as an entity that operates like a "bank", they really need to work on that. I was especially irritated that they would delete my account even when there was money still in it, and it's unacceptable (at least in my opinion) that they would do it without notifying me or giving me any warning in advance.
I had money in my account, and it took almost 3 MONTHS before their support finally un-deleted my account with the money back in it. I have all of the communications between myself and their support staff over that period saved as well.
I ended up losing money in the end, because this all happened over the past few months as bitcoin prices have skyrocketed and I was SOL on exchanging  currencies.
I would jump to another exchange in a heartbeat if a decent one came up, unfortunately MtGox is the "best" option these days. Sigh.
tl;dr - MtGox deleted my account for "inactivity" even though I had several hundred dollars stored there, it took almost 3 months for them to restore my account even after daily communication with their support.

My transaction came through at a very crazy time, as the exchange rate had to be very close to ~$80 and it deposited just as mtgox came online and the markets went crazy. 
I was able to make some lucky trades and came out on top still, these $20 swings are still making me dizzy though.
I hope you came out with your head above the water as well :)

It looks like bitinstant has suspended several modes of deposits, from their twitter feed:
Right now the only thing that looks open is Cash-&gt;MtGox
I deposited cash-to-bitcoin address about two hours ago when the prices were ~$115, and I'm kicking myself because I'm pretty sure BitInstant transfers to MtGox to get their exchange rate, and then they send the bitcoins to your wallet from there.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to get majorly screwed on the exchange rate, so I'm glad it was only $40 I put in. I guess I'll find out whenever my deposit eventually goes through :-/

That's because OT WILL stay open source, Monetas is simply there to provide enterprise level support to their enterprise customers and to develop products directly for them.
It would be akin to claiming that Linux is closed source because someone wrote a closed source video game that runs on top of it, or that TCP/IP is closed-source because closed-source applications use it to communicate.

Buttercoin isn't distributed or peer to peer, nor is their ultimate goal the decentralization of exchanges. 
Buttercoin will ultimately still require hosted exchange services, whereas this project is seeking to eliminate that need.
