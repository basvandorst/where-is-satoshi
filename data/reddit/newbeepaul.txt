Get the old hardware (mobile) via e.g. ebay. Factory reset it. Install old app version that was on this phone. I would start with the phone from 2016. If it does not work you still can try with old phone from 2014 and then 2013. You should get all of these phones quite cheap in ebay.
You also might have a backup of these phones on a hard disk. Try to reinstall these backups on the respective old hardware repurchased.

Wow, really? Will it be activated soon after Segwit?
That would mean that fees will come down fast?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:07:20
Thank you for your argument. 
I added that this should just be seen from the point of view of value.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:06:11
I hope the updates will come soon, so we can take advantage of higher capacity and lower fees. It is time for the BTC chain to gain strength again.

Your strategy may work, thank you for your idea, but I see it more from the side of the holdlers who feel attacked by Bitcoin Cash. Nevertheless they can defend their value if above described suggestion is applied.

Oh, interesting to know. So, everybody could get already low fees if he/she uses Segwit now? 
Concerning the mempool. I thinknthe mempool is there to pile up transactions which do not fit into the next block. But with Segwit, more transactions could be packed into the block and like this the mempool should be cleared or lowered substantially, bringing again lower fees?

First I was also very impatient. But now I understood that Segwit was meant to be ramped up slowly but steadily over the next weeks. 
But trust is already increasing every day and I think this is being and still will be honoured in the price for Bitcoins

I wrote NYA miners because the supportive BCH miners are mining at a loss at the moment on the BCH chain. So the plan is basically valid for the NYA miners.

A solution to stop the damaging effect of bcash is very easy to be applied. After the next difficulty adjustment of bcash the difficulty will be around 30-40% of the BTC chain. If BTC miners start defending their chain by mining a block every 90 minutes on the bcash chain, this chain will be put in a deep sleep phase until 2018. It is really a simple game theory and very easy to win the competition.

I think that is a very good basis to start a discussion in order to be prepared for future hard forks which could threaten the bitcoin core chain.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:11:20
Yes, 100 blocks is around 5% of the period 2016. The miners can increase their profit by around 100% and might lose your mentioned 5%. (taking the current BCH coin price into consideration). I think that is a huge profit increase. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:18:39
If I understand correctly, the faster everybody uses it the faster the fees are lowered, the mempool will be cleared and the more the trust increases into the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:05:44
I meant the BTC and BCH chain. There is no 2x chain yet. 
If the BTC miners swap their hash rate in a manner that 6 EDAs take place on the BCH chain then they can play above mentioned plan and roughly increase their profit by 100% on cost of the BCH chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:38:21
Yes, it looks like the BCH owners have to pay the bill for this oscillation. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:34:16
The LN solution sounds good to me. But when will it be implemented - maybe too far in the future to prevent that the BTC chain gets hurt by the big blockers?
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:32:10
Thank you for your detailed answer. Wow, some misers can use some trick to be able to mine faster and cash in on the expense of others? That is maybe why  there is this mysterious unknown miner with 92% hash power. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:39:20
Sorry, I am looking for advice - not abusive language.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:34:24
I have a different opinion, sorry. The power should be distributed in a balanced way. I think this way would be best. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:06:18
I fully agree. It seems to be necessary to come up with solutions to ensure that not too much power can be concentrated in the hands of miners. What could be done to solve the problem? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:44:39
Yes, I mean Bitcoin cash. So why is it worrying? Everybody should get informed before considering to switch a bit from Bitcoin to Bitcoin cash - to avoid uninformed decisions. I think it is not good to switch but still need to learn more about it - why it should not be done.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:21:20
You are totally wrong with your assumption. 
Actually the attackers need much less money.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:32:28
The real problem is if S2X was successful a few big miners would really take over the code. It is never good if all/most of the power is centralised in a few hands only. This is against the spirit of Bitcoin isn't it? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:39:25
Yes, basically users totally avoid BCH and only a couple of BCH miners do now and then a transaction while trying to mine 8MB blocks. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:36:18
Presumably the attack is easier to be made at BCH chain because of big blocks and much cheaper
