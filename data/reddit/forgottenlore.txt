The provision does help them, but I still don't want to screw them at my expense. Assuming I get my money back (hypothetically), I can make a profit from this bad situation (also hypothetically). To do that I have to trade and pay the provision. I don't like paying them money, but it wont stop me if it means that I also make a profit.

So what if it is infinitely divisible? When people lose their cold storage wallet or whatever, that bitcoin is lost forever, which means there are fewer in circulation, which means the price goes up. Which means people will not spend because why should they if tomorrow they could buy twice as much? And more deflation.
@_date: 2014-04-10 10:57:09
Thank you for all the responses. I will surely find something I like.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:09:41
I should probably have been clearer, I apologise. What I meant is as opposed to bitcoin being a currency. I am an European and have little knowledge about American tax legislation. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:20:56
I can appreciate sarcasm, but you do understand that it doesn't take long before a little underspending on a large enough scale to have an impact on the economy, right? I mean this stuff has happened through history, there have been deflation periods in the past, you know.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:02:53
I am on your side, though. I believe in bitcoin, but have some questions.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:07:12
I have as well, but if I would probably sell if it went above 1k.

I did a Fourier transformation on the data, but it was just noise.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:19:38
I am sorry, I was expecting serious answers. Should I have added a [serious] tag? The question may be poorly worded, but did you not know what I meant? I was having a discussion with someone that's against bitcoin and they said that if bitcoin was meant to replace fiat, then the limited amount is obviously a problem. So perhaps it was not intended to replace fiat, but Nakamoto surely had some goals for it.

That's different, because you lose purchasing power, and you hope the inflation is temporary (or at least slow enough that you don't have to worry).
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:21:51
Don't know, it doesn't for me
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:41:05
Nice contribution to the discourse there.

The autocorrelation function of a periodic function is itself periodic with the same period, but this doesn't seem like it is. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:32:34
Whoa, they have *taxes in Europe*?!?! Thank you for the condescension, for the answer not so much. I still don't know what is the difference between property and income tax as it pertains to bitcoin. I will go elsewhere with the query.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:33:06
The question still stands, how can bitcoin replace banks if it is as volatile as it is? No-one will want to have their assets stored in BTC if it is likely to drop the next day.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:51:19
Sorry, calm down.

To make this subreddit as clean as possible, I would strongly suggest searching for an answer before posting a question. For example if you search for "mt gox eli5", you probably get a dozen returns already.

But inflation and deflation (in the extreme) have the same effects. Deflation means people hoard money, inflation that they hoard non-perishable goods. In other areas they try to spend less.

Mine as well.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:49:47
So what? It can all be converted to fiat at any time, and $100 does not equal $10. And as long as people keep losing bitcoin, the price keeps going up. People will not spend it if they profit from holding. And not spending on a large scale is not good for the economy.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:04:56
No, I absolutely agree.
@_date: 2014-03-11 09:19:48
I did not contradict myself, you misunderstood. Hoarding currency in the deflation period obviously doesn't mean for an infinite amount of time. If enough people spend less (not zero of course), it absolutely has an impact on the economy. For example if 50% of the population spends 10% less this month than the one before (because it is an investment during deflation), that means 5% less money in circulation.
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:13:01
On a global scale you don't have to wait for ever. That's why deflation is a thing.

People should be able to get together under their own terms, not under the umbrella of a religion, especially since we all know how tolerant they are of free thought.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:30:27
We very well might. Bitcoin, for one!
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:38:34
There are two possible outcomes: I get my money back, or I don't. If I get it back it makes sense to trade like normally in the meantime (which includes paying provision), and if I don't the provision does not matter, because I lost everything. So the provision is irrelevant, really.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:45:54
Noob here as well, I just find it all fascinating. Spreading the word at this stage is just the thing Bitcoin needs, I think.
@_date: 2015-05-28 09:39:49
Thanks, that would be great.
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:29:00
I understand what you mean and I totally agree, I did lump every religion together and wrongly so.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:29:40
This looks great, thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:05:39
I agree that it is important that people are provided forums where they can bring up and discuss ideas, and that churches may present a suitable venue. But I stand by what I said, especially the last part. The dogmatic nature of the teachings of the biggest religions leaves little up for interpretation and whatever new ideas may come should, as far as the church is concerned, be rooted in its doctrine.
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:38:12
Agreed, trust is an issue. But aside from that, I think if you don't do anything illegal (so the police has no grounds for issuing a warrant), your privacy is safe without ever having to use mixers.
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:15:43
But if I don't disclose that a certain adress is tied to my name, doesn't that maintain privacy? For example if I sold bitcoins for dollars on an exchange would anyone besides the exchange know it was me?
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:40:50
But you can do that without mixers, can't you? Couldn't you just not share one of your accounts publicly?
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:42:03
Don't multiple adresses also cover that for example?
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:04:11
But if you're careful noone knows your name is attached to the address (except for an exchange for example), or do they?
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:02:31
What are you talking about? The answer was "privacy" and I asked whether multiple adresses already covered that issue.
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:52:14
Yeah, that's for sure. The information is there and if someone wants it enough they can probably get it.
