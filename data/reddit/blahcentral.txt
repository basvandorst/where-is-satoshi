Don't forget the Winklevii and their ETF - it might be cool to see a "sequel" to the social network, with the same actors.  and they have to bring back Rooney Mara as well, maybe as some corrupt exec or hacker or something.

I noticed last week Coinbase was lagging behind other exchanges on the various upswings that were happening, so much so that it was easy to take advantage of the price differences, just by simply buying coins and not having to trade.  At times, Coinbase was 10 dollars cheaper than Stamp...maybe this is normal for those that watch the charts 24/7 
I got the sense last week that something anomolous is happening with Coinbase, and possibly with Bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2015-12-05 15:26:26
makes sense given current rise in price? ie. bigger demand so higher price?
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:05:46

i feel like when the price increases faster than the proportionate rate of mining technology development, it won't be worth it, until the price stabilizes again...I could be wrong (or is it the opposite?  if the difficulty stays the same, I supposed it just be a simple increase on ROI) - either way, even when all the bitcoins are mined, mining is still an attractive proposition because of TrAnSaCtIoN FeEs :)

so if there is widespread adoption of these chips by the miners, what would that mean for the price of btc?  if the coins become less expensive to mine, wouldn't that mean that transaction fees, and ultimately the market value of bitcoin, would decrease?
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:00:53
why isn't this causing a rise in price

I really enjoyed reading about Swaps, like how companies in different countries with different interest rates can swap those rates as part of a mutually beneficial financial arrangement.
