Does unstoppabledomains  becomes something big? 
Is it worth invest it in?
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:23:00
Panama and Costa Rica are not part of South America.
South America is South America, not Central America or Caribbean Islands.
Yes, Davinci Lives in Chile, very nice country so is Uruguay but expensive as hell, dollarized.

Or could all be a smoke screen for Libra to be a way out for the US debt(no more fiat printing), as well other Nations with big debt, Libra will be base on local currencies as well, the big picture is bigger than we can see right now.
FB can easily buy this  bonds as long, Libra will make 'Bad" money circulate, one hand will wash the other.
This is going ahead, right now the US Gov is just putting a face, but will be a "partner" in this "project".

Are you still around?
Is the deep/correction for this "cycle" over?
Is 100K still in play for this year/early 2020?
Could you say if unstoppabledomains is something worth investing in?
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:59:47
Has the time line changed?
We don't appear to be going towards the 100K!
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:15:21
Has the time line changed?
The 100K appears to be getting further and further away!

@_date: 2019-08-04 12:10:13
Thanks for your reply, I think the same, we will have the normal corrections but for now I also think that the big retrace is over that is it, will see.
Maybe he went back all ready.

@_date: 2019-04-09 23:54:49


and how is BTC going to "behave". 
That part was not very well formulated. ;(
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:14:12


 I will be here next in 2020, only a few weeks
You wrote two different things! Are you here until 2020 or you are coming back in 2020?
One question, do time travelers had any thing to do with this big buy of  U$100,000,000 BTC?
Best regards

"I share it so those who see it see it will be given courage to continue on their path. In particular, one individual I remember constantly searching curiously for time travel. If I remember correctly, this individual will come accross this and save the info, using the predictions to further validate their holdings".
When I read this comment I got the chills man, I am not saying is me, or the message was for me,  but I have been searching for such subject for a while, to be more precised, since I read the first post from the AKA" Posted by u/Luka_Magnotta", I am not sure if you are the same guy. I think I read that first post last year or the year before.
 But even before, the subject of time travel is fascinating, and for as long as I can remember it has captivating my attention.
At this point in our time, 2019, there are a lot of talks of a major recession coming, maybe this year, if not 2020, can  you comment on that, how is going to effect the World,  and how is BTC going to "behave".
Best regards.

Good morning from my neck of the woods.
If you are still around?
What does a time traveler do here? I mean spear time, do you occupy yourself with a "day job"?
I have a question, can you tell us about the Future of Europe? Will the Muslims,  as a consequence of the EU PC decisions, going to really "destroy" Europe?
Best regards.

Thanks for your reply, I am wondering where is this guy here?
He hasn't post for a while.

I did not remember the part about Lichtenstein been mentioned on that story,  interesting what you mentioned what they just did, and on the quantum "thing" yes I read that.
Well Lichtenstein is just fallowing its natural course, they are the ones that in deed hide the most dirty money out there, contrary to what a lot of people think,  is not the Swiss.
So is comes as a Natural move, looking in to the Future. ;D

No shit, I what a F Idea, not just to make serious cash but at the same time would help to spread the BTC "thing".
AWESOME idea.

Could be, but part of the original post, was in deed removed.

Based on current market, that feels or sounds far from reality at this point!
