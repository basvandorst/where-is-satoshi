Ahah yes in a sense, I got my first fraction of a bitcoin during the dip :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:42:57
Ahah no :) Just a few hours with some nice music to get it the way I wanted. I spent most of the time experimenting with different animation styles.

You can use it in social media if you want. I've included each phase as an individual gif in a comment if you want to use those :)
