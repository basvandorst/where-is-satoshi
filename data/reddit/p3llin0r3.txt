I have my bitcoin on a work computer, I just needed any wallet to keep it in until I got home tonight to set everything else up.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:47:17
XD research the wallet! :p

Not asking for donations, wouldn't accept them. I thought it was a reputable site because it's linked to by the "Getting Started" page in this subreddit's sidebar, and looks a little jank but relatively nice.

I WANTED. A. ONLINE WALLET QUICKLY. The entire reason this subreddit exists is as a reference to new bitcoin users/ updates on bitcoin related news.
I wasn't mixing, I was transporting my bitcoin to a wallet, so I could move it to an encrypted wallet on my linux machine at home. is it really too much to ask? To be pointed to a reputable site by a famous, highly visible subreddit? Really?
Great idea: How about, instead of having phishing links in your subreddit sidebar, put something that's NOT ripping people off! And then you would have a community that isn't completely toxic and horrible!

Apparently nobody in your community has anything to contribute, seeing as how you have a phishing link in your "Getting Started" sidebar link under "trusted sites" for over a month.
Also, I think I will stick to banks. Enjoy getting all of your bitcoins ripped off by a hacker / exchange owner!

I trusted your sidebar link. There are 130,000 people in this subreddit. i assumed the things in your sidebar were trustworthy links, and I would have to click more than twice from that page to reach a phishing site, especially for something as simple as a wallet.
I'll post proof images tomorrow, I got screenies just in case.

I'm not accusing you of scamming me, I'm accusing your admins and their admins of profound incompetence.
Obviously it's not the whole community's fault.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:51:27
Not blaming bitcoin, blaming admins
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:27:20
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to "Getting Started"
2. Click on any of the "Examples"
3. Go to a phishing site and get ripped off for 1k+ of money.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:08:26
Pretty much, yeah. If I can get scammed within two clicks from your community's sidebar, then your community sucks.

I mined it super early, I was just sitting on it was gonna use it for a vacation -_-
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:17:52
Ahh, that's a good point. Wasn't thinking I suppose. I'm usually more cautious (I'm a developer, so I'm very tech savvy) BTC is such an institution I just assumed it was legit

Not locking the "Getting Started" wiki page, and allowing anyone to edit it is either caused by maliciousness or by incompetence. 
There's no way this is the first time this has happened, why not just lock the thing?
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:35:02
I have to disagree it's nobody's fault. Bitcoin should have locked that wiki page from being edited. It's their admins fault. 
I know that They couldn't prevent the supporting wiki page from being created, but the getting started page should be locked.
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:42:32
Ahh, oh good, so I can't even trust the actual bitcoin wiki to be curated for this type of thing.
Also, that's NOT the nature of a wiki. You can limit the ability of people to be able change pages, and if any pages should be limited, it would be THAT ONE. So effing vuln it's ridiculous.
Additionally: It's not affiliated? *ahem*

No warning. Nothing. it states "These are the trusted links you should use to get started with bitcoin!" You give it your endorsement right on the side of the fucking page. 
My fault my ass, this is the fucking community's fault if I can click on the sidebar and get phished in less than two clicks.
Sorry, i assumed this was a mature technology Reddit that wiped their ass, I guess I was mistaken.
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:02:03
Not even comparable. This is as if in AOL's sign up page, they had an endorsement for a nigerian prince who needs to move money into the United States.
Remember, I got to this page by:
1. Going to this subreddit.
2. Clicking on Getting Started, leading me to the official bitcoin wiki's "Getting Started" page
3. Using one of their recommended online wallets.
Two clicks from your subreddit, one of them through the sidebar, the other through the bitcoin official wiki. Not at all like you described.
