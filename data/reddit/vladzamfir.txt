Alas, a better Bitcoin UX

For me when I'm trying to deposit BTC

If the number of hashing functions that might be generated is greater than, say, 2^80, then you won't be able to have a specialized component for each one. The part that never changes can be made to take 0.01% of the execution, by the way.

There is. It's simple. Make a totally new hashing function every block. Nice try, though, Mike.

I just realized that if you created a new hashing function for every mining nonce, and generation takes enough orders of magnitude less time than execution, and the class of functions being generated is still broad enough, that we would have a CPU-only mining algorithm ;)

Yes it'd be a hashing function - how predictable it is depends on the size of the class of functions you're drawing from.

You missed people who think it's funny but don't care why

The law knows no humor, sees no humor

Yep, not sure it can get any better than this, though. At least there are plenty of CPUs in the world, already :)

It's not that we don't understand - it's that we're greedy and want to accumulate more bitcoin. Any silly thing that slows adoption is a god-send, from this perspective :)

Actually it looks like the 'ASIC' would be an FPGA that reprograms itself after every block. Unless someone can find a way to beat FPGAs...

[Bitcoin Address = Base58Encode(Key hash concatenated with Checksum)]( so blame Bas58Encode?
