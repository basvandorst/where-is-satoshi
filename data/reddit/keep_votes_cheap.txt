The key to Bitcoin becoming a real, viable currency is acceptance and ease-of-access.  If its a pain to get them, (sketchy exchanges, high fees) people won't be eager to convert their cash to such a volatile currency.  It seems like most exchanges are getting their U.S. bank accounts shutdown, once their cash flow picks up.  But more importantly, for BTC to be successful, there needs to be more things (real goods and services) that can be purchased with Bitcoins just as easily as using the local currency.  If Bitcoins are primarily being used to buy illegal drugs and swap on exchanges, I'm doubtful that it's moving towards widespread usage.

I have personally lost bitcoins (through a scam) that were purchased. +1 for us.

Unfortunately it is true that those who have the ability to invest the most in the beginning (the rich) will benefit the most from using Bitcoin as an investment.  However, each coin is divisible to 0.00000001 BTC, so increases in prices do not prohibit anyone from buying a small dollar amount worth of coins.

No. There is no way to "revise" a transaction.  Leave your client open (the one you sent the coins from), to encourage confirmations.  It will eventually be confirmed.  Be patient.

I read the OP's post wrong and didn't realize he was using a web-based client.  If you are using a native client (such as Bitcoin-QT), leaving the program running (and connected to the Internet) seems to help get more confirmations in less time.

Coins are indeed quite divisible (1 million Satoshis each).

You really do need to tell your immediate family (those who would be inheriting your other assets as well) at least how to access your coins (in the event of your death).  Definitely not friends or haters.

This does sometimes pisses me off, but not nearly as much as seeing "BitCoin" does.  Yes, I'm OCD.

I skipped over the fact he was using a Blockchain wallet. OP just needs to be patient, and yeah, if its not confirmed the fund get returned.

Drug dealers, child pornographers, scammers, money launders, and other criminals are also well invested in USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, etc.  Does this discourage you from utilizing local currencies?  Its just easier to calculate the amount of business done on Silk Road (the equivalent of a few million $ per month) whereas the black market of the just the U.S. pulls in an estimated $1 trillion annually.  Illegal commerce done in Bitcoins is a drop in the bucket compared to that of paper currency.

Its been a while since I last had to transfer over 200 million USD (and if I needed to again, I wouldn't use an experimental currency to do so).

Who is the joker with $9.4 million worth of coins?
