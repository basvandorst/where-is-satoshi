...you know about Belarus, right?

That's fair, it just seemed odd seeing as we're discussing Belarus rather than countries in general. They don't call it "Europe's last dictatorship" for nothing.

I'm sorry, are you being sarcastic?

Sure but it doesn’t have to be that way. In practice this is an international website.

I don't think it would. If it costs $42.28 for the petrol to drive 310 miles, you're looking at a saving of $41.82. The average American drives 37 miles per day, so let's take that as our assumption and say we're going to save $5 per day. It would take you 9,800 days to recuperate the $49,000 for the long-range vehicle, which means you'd have to drive this thing for *27 years* before you earned your money back. That's not even considering insurance etc.
EDIT: I realise I misread. It costs $6.82 for the petrol to drive 310 miles. That's even worse: you're saving about 80 cents a day, which means it would actually take you 168 years to earn your money back in the savings.

The value of the dollar isn't static either though. It's subject to pressures like inflation, and movements in the forex market changing the price of goods that depend on other currencies in their supply chain.

The Model 3 is an expensive vehicle.
