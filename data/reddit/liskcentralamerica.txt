What makes you think it’s only 1-2 percent ? 
Just because milk goes up 2% ?
Inflation is probably closer to 10% 
The government keeps changing the index on how’s it calculated but even then they are just saying oh prices went up this much.
They completely ignore the trillions of dollars that they print lol. 
I mostly dislike inflation as it is now because it’s a big lie.
On the blockchain it’s different.

Why do you need to encourage spending ? To stimulate the economy? Is spending money on your needs not enough ? We need to spend more then we need ? 
Investors will spend money to make money but I think even the average person in America does not more money then what is needed to get by. 
Do you think if people had excess money they would need more reason to invest it or spend it ?
Inflation just seems like a quick way to steal money and print endless money and say “maaaa inflation”

99% of the people in America live the way they do because of debt. 
I bet you dollars to donuts in 1929 it was easier to fill that cart then it is now.

All inflation is the printing of money that diluted the current supply.
The government will have you think it’s the cost of goods going up but this is just a symptom. 
So do you agree with the government printing endless amounts of money that diluted the value of the money you have?
