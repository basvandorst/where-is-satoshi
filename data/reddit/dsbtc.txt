"anarchist who believes in... lots and lots of laws"
You also don't seem to know what you believe.
edit: I apologize for saying this in a dickish way, but what you said makes no sense and, if anything, supports his point that bitcoiners hold views that conflict with each other.

Gold and oil are also up.
This is probably the best environment for BTC, an emergency political situation. It's fast, can't be traced, can't be repossessed by the government. If the price follows commodities like it has been, it will maintain buying power, which is all that matters in these situations.
Edit: when I say "can't be traced" obviously I mean regarding identifying a user or locating the ultimate location of the coins, not recording transactions.

They already have value for transactions, and coins with a small level of built-in inflation have a huge advantage over bitcoin for gaining widespread use. People don't sit on them, they spend them.
The growth of altcoins indicates that they'll have future demand and use. If they reach wide enough levels of use, Bitcoin will need to have an alternate use or it won't offer significant benefit over other stores of value.

Ukraine invasion. Bitcoin is much quicker/easier to buy than precious metals, and doesn't require that you hold it physically, which would be easy to have stolen/confiscated during social unrest. Also, stocks are declining, so if you're worried about loss you don't want to put your money in them at the moment.

In the context of the shutdown, this sounds like it really was a ponzi scheme but one with a better alibi.
They discover the flaw in their own system; use it to surreptitiously withdraw the money to their own wallets; keep it going, ponzi-style, as long as possible by not letting people withdraw large amounts, while maintaining plausible deniability because you're "unknowingly getting hacked". When the price reaches a high, sell the coins on other markets, and after you've gotten out completely, shut down and claim you were robbed.

It doesn't matter if a bitcoin is traceable to a transaction, it matters if it's traceable *to the user*. 
Russia is going to annex Crimea. If a Ukrainian living there wants to send his money overseas, and he sends it to a newly created BTC wallet in another country using a service from another country, how are the Russians going to know where he sent his money or what happened to it? The wallet number can be found, but nobody knows where that wallet is or who has it.

That this is happening in NJ, with taxes, isn't actually surprising. I have dealt with the depts. of revenue in about 14 states on the East Coast of the US. The NJ Dept of Revenue are the only ones I have any complaints about. They're extremely shady and look at every business like they need to scam you before you can scam them.

He simply said "laws", which by definition are enforced by a ruling power.  In the context of the post he was responding to, talking about government-imposed laws, what he said was "I'm an anarchist who likes government laws". Which makes no sense.

I admit I don't know that much about it, but I think it is anonymous unless you connect a blockchain to a wallet to a person. Gox revealed the chains associated with their accounts.
If you sell your stocks, take your money and buy coins with it from an overseas company, I don't think your government can trace them, and if so they can't confiscate them without your data.

I assume this means that for every dollar you withdraw, Don King gets 60 cents.
