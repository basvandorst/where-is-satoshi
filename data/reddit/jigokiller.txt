Selling your company for $43 million can absolutely be considered a success.
Who cares what the CEO of the acquiring company did.  That's completely irrelevant.  I think you may have committed a logical fallacy there but I can't be bothered to look it up.

Series 13 is the last, I've watched up to 11 or 12 now I think.  Damn it Agatha, write more!

I had a friend who worked for his last company, Playsino.  They worked for months on casino games on the Facebook platform.
Things weren't going well (they failed to ship a product), and Brock kept promising them that investment was coming.  Most of them were working for reduced or no salary for weeks, with the promise that they'd be paid when investment finally came in.  It didn't, Brock moved on and left a lot of his employees financially screwed.
This guy's just a greedy opportunist.  If he senses he can make money from it, he'll drop everything and use his resume/child actor status/PR firm to push his way in.   This is why he's trying to lobby the japanese courts to steal people's Bitcoins - he doesn't give a shit about the original owners or the community, he's just in it to make as much money as possible for himself.
There is no way on earth this guy is good for Bitcoin.  Please don't vote him into the foundation.

They could stop me from withdrawal if they hacked my email, sure.  Then I'd get the email back via my provider, secure it, and bam - no bitcoins stolen.
I had both an inputs.io and a mtgox account, but never trusted them with any Bitcoins.  When I see a serial entrepreneur who has secured $20 million funding from Benchmark it eliminates any doubt in my mind that he's going to run away with the money.  You don't just raise that amount of money without a significant amount of experience, trust and sheer hard work.

I have ripped episodes of Poirot that are nearly as big as that.

The peace of mind that I haven't screwed up with my cold wallets/brain wallets.  That if I get a zero-day exploit with a keylogger on my system I'm not going to lose my Bitcoins.
If there's any withdrawal request for the Bitcoin in the Vault I can cancel it via email and put a hold on it, which is nice.
I just personally think that all of that is worth 0.12% of my coins.

0.12% is not that high.  It was low enough for me to transfer a serious amount of Bitcoin to Xapo.  1/800th of your Bitcoin per year to ensure peace of mind?
EDIT - its 1/18 of the cost of storing Bitcoins with Elliptic (I hope they get their act together!)

More the fact that he moved on to Bitcoin and didn't really care about casino games any more even though he had employees still working for him.  He was also promising them he'd pay them in the future, which he never did.
No - I think the Bitcoin Foundation's simply a honeypot for unscrupulous businessmen looking out for their own financial gain (Gavin not included).  Unfortunately, no matter what I think the people in the foundation are given an awful lot of credibility.
