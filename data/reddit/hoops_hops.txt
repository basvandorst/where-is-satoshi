Kinda hoping that prices stay for a bit so I can buy more with the starting bonus from my new job. Would be pretty cool to own 1 whole coin.

Ive been watching crypto since last year's spike and fall and have decided to purchase some to hold onto for awhile. I like the idea of having some available for payments in a wallet on my phone. But I want to store most of it securely.
What's the simplest way to make a cold storage wallet with 1 or 2 backups.
I am not incredibly technical. But can usually google my way through problems. But with all my research I am undecided on what would be best for me and unclear on how it actually works.
Currently I have about $1000 value of bitcoin in the cash app and I want to move it to wallets pronto.
I know no one can tell me exactly what to do. As that largely depends on how paranoid I am. 
But what would be one simple scenario to move my coin from the cash app to a secure offline wallet to hold?

Noob question.
I want to have a cold wallet for long term storage. I am not concerned with burglary or my house burning down as much as I am with it simply breaking or not working (like a hard drive becoming corrupted).
I recently transferred my Bitcoin from the cash app into Bitcoin wallet on my Android.
Now if I save the backup file on to multiple flash drives and store them each in a safe location. 
Can I then delete the wallet from my phone and effectively have a cold wallet?

Is there a thread to ask noob setup questions?

You obviously haven't had American beer in a few decades.
Ok boomer

I wouldn't insinuate that only Americans can pour a proper pint. That's ridiculous.

Someone can't pour a proper pint.

I think he actually meant that other countries pour beer differently. For instance in Germany it's common to pour a lager straight down the glass to form a large head, let the head settle, and then top off the glass. 
I was using the ambiguity of his comment to make a joke as if he meant something else. 
Yes I can pour an excellent Guinness.

Just waiting for a whale to drop a duece and bring the price down so I can make a quick purchase before it hits 20k

Did not sign in, I don't even have a coinbase account. I used a computer that had no connection to any of my Bitcoin logins to check out the URL.

Right. If they really wanted to get people it would say "a Reddit user thought your comment was great and sent you 5 satoshis. Click here to claim your coin"

I guess real isn't the right word. What I mean is that you can buy anything with it. Mass adoption, go to the grocery store and pay for milk type of currency.

I just day trade cause it's fun. I'm holding the rest. But I do believe the vision of crypto is that it would be used as a real currency, and that requires both adoption and price stability. And those are somewhat of a chicken and egg situation.
