I have investments in other cryptos but bitcoin is the only one I can directly buy with out getting other people to buy it for me. Due to no one allowing under 18s the verify on trading websites.

For real?

I already knew the fees, just didn’t realise it was actually transferring bitcoin. Thought they’d just assign that to your amount allowed to spend.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:58:34
I know, that’s the reason I was buying as I thought it was pretty low at the moment so I might as well 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:26
Yeah I knew what the fees were. But I just assumed that didn’t actually transfer any actual bitcoin, just assigned it to your account. Also on the final confirmation screen it says “amount you’ll receive” and then an amount close to how much I was paying. But when I received it it then showed much less.

It annoys me more knowing That I knew the fees before buying. I just didn’t think they’d apply for buying from the app. Also on the confirmation screen it even says that the amount you’ll receive is way higher than I actually got

I’m sure it won’t matter in a month but it’s still aids losing 46 dollars for nothing

Well we know op has serious money invested then.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:02:55

As if their customer service wasn’t slow enough, we have this to worry about. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:22:51
Oh right I see, it’s s security concern. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:33:51
If you have a card you can buy from the blockchain app. Think the rates are shite though 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:53:59
It actually needs to be changed on there, people could think it has something to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:23:51
I’ve seen that too, always gives me a good laugh.

I hope OP finds them. I actually couldn’t continue life as normal working for an hourly wage  knowing I have had hundreds of thousands if not millions on an old inaccessible account.

Fuck, feels bad man. I don’t really know much about mining as I only got around to finally buying some very recently. But I’m only 17 so there is still time for it to increase hopefully.
But I just found on an old forum about early mining people talking about the amounts mined: someone in early 2011 said he was mining several bitcoin per day using a Radeon HD 6970 which isn’t too different in terms of power from the GTX 460.
So let’s say several bitcoin is about 3 bitcoin per day and you had them on for 3 months straight ( let’s assume several per day means including the time turned off at night)  
3 bitcoin X 90 days = 270 bitcoin or roughly 1.9 million USD 
Even though the original figures are all estimated I think it shows just what kind of money you could be on too. 
Hope it’s not another case like that guy who threw out his hard drive. 
Although I haven’t got a clue how you can get them back, I’m sure someone else will. Just be careful about the details you give out so you don’t get them stolen.

Gotta share that love 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:17:39
Yeah, same here 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:21:43
Yeah, I looked on the segwit2x policy for coinbase and it says they will give you it automatically. But just reading comments saying how it was a bad idea got me worried. I thought I was just missing something. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:56:43
Don’t hate yourself. No one can predict the future. If we all knew what was going to happen in the future we would have bought thousands in 2009 when one bitcoin  was a fraction of a dollar.
 You can still buy bitcoin now and from what people are saying it seems it will keep up with the trend of rising. So you could still make a lot of money down the line.
Although if there is a way to somehow access the money, the best way would be to put up a reward of so many bitcoin as an incentive for people to put time in to finding out how you can get them back.
