I dont see why it wouldnt. If it is too often, scale it back a bit

Yes I meant to controlling of the lights. Maybe a mail server that can parse commands to run much more than lights.

Can't you just check the balance of the account every couple seconds or minutes to see if it's changed?

There's gotta be a better way...

I'm thinking about selling my little single order date Aug 5 2012. If I get a good offer it's sold.

Mobile site sucks, every time I scroll some black box come in from the side and blocks everything (4.2.2)
Anyways, can I add a fee to using the ATM? A way to recoop some of that $750, couldn't read the FAQs sorry.

I've got a little single with 9+ btc mined with it so far. I've made a very decent profit and continue to make money everyday.

I don't think they did it on purpose. Mtgox is down!

I can't find that screen. I'm looking at Account Info and Account Dash. Everything says "Pending Acceptance"
Edit: It came up after a few clicks around. Should pop up on login. I thought about selling my order from Aug 5 yesterday... faith somewhat restored

Errrm if your living paycheck to paycheck this might not be your best gamble/investment. However, it's your money use it when you need it.

1-3 months is a large range for 4-6k. 6k in one month is a lot and 6k in two months is what I make parking cars. &lt;6k in three months I wouldn't recommend risking money on btc, especially if you don't have savings. 
Which is my next point, most people have savings already there to buy large items out of. (the way I was raised makes me think most people save, but seeing the credit crisis I'm not so sure)

If you live close by I can hook you up in person for cash. Or try localbitcoin.com to see if anyone near you is selling

There's an extension/plugin (I can't remember which browser is what) for chrome that let's you use btc on amazon. Or use gyft.

Silk road is the amazon of drugs. Not eBay. Fair prices, no bidding
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:30:36
Such thing

If your order says "processing" under "my orders" then you're set. If it says "Pending Acceptance" then you've got some investigating to do.

They never actually sold cards did they? Just bought the domain with the intent

Did you read the article? You can lose your deposit but any greater loss comes out of btc.sx pocket. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:05:49
Yea I'm interested
Edit: Awesome! It's downloading right now!

I can check the exact numbers, but my retail pharmacy creates well over 3Gb a week in transaction history. Then again pharmacies have to hold on to a lot more data. Never once have I considered storing all that data to be an issue and I have to keep it for 7-10years. As the store grew we adapted, bought more raid controllers and hard drive. No biggie.
