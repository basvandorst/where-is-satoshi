Yes, just like your bank if it goes bankrupt. (this has happened recently in quite a few countries) 
If you want to keep it in your own possession, it will be safe from your bankruptcy fears. But be warned that many people lose their own money just as easily. Hell, you can lose all your cash on the way home from the bank. 
Learn how to keep your money safe, there's lots of good information on the sidebar - - - &gt;
PS, Coinbase is US only iirc. 
Just find a bitcoin atm near you and put your crypto on a phone or paper wallet. It's probably easiest for you

Parts of this are great, other parts are almost misinformation. This video completely evades the holding of assets, private wealth, and ignores that some bonds even create wealth (build a bridge for businesses to drive on.) 
This is a pretty good explanation of fractional reserves and money creation but not so much the overall system of fiat. I really wish there was a better explanation on YouTube. 
Having said that, fuck all of this, buy crypto and other assets.

There are a lot of thefts, just like normal currency. 
So what? Does stealing a gold bar make it bad currency? Nope. 
Bitcoin is as secure as you want it to be. But security is not always people's primary goal when trading currency. 
Meh, bitcoin is bitcoin.

If you want government backed currency and accounts, you are in the wrong place. Crypto promises literally nothing except a trustless system. 
And the government does not replace currency lost on your way home. 
Buy government bonds if you like the government to back your investments.

Hahaha, this is the best thing since its inception! I love it.

Yeah he never covers it in his series so I take it as spin. I really don't think you need to protect people from the truth for them to understand the topic. 
Fiat is a shitty system, not because it is a bad system, but because corrupt idiots hold onto it. It's similar to the reaction that gold is bad because it can cause a depression when misused. 
Tools are only as good as the people who use them.

If I knew that I could make a lot of money.

\ 
\ cryptocurrency tends to be abstract, I would just accept it if you want to invest in it. 
\ investing is not easy money. It's hard work to research, understand, and you have to risk losing your capital. Just roll with it. Scared money don't make money.

Why on earth would you buy bitcoins!? It's basically guaranteed to cause a massive fluctuation in the value of your currency. For better or worse. 
Why not invest in an ETF with great diversity or something?

Bitfinex, bitstamp, poloniex, and more

Well today we don't have that. We only have regular investing and work.

I am now the financial investment advisor for a lot of people. 
I learned how money works, where it comes from, and why fiat is so interesting. 
If I never make another dime from bitcoin I will be able to retire from the knowledge I gained from understanding all this stuff. 
By investing in bitcoin I have helped hundreds of people and it has changed my life. Knowledge is power.
