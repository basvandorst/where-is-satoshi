If you just want a full node, no LN, Bitcoin Core is fine. For LN, use Pierre Rochard's Node Launcher

Yes, you can do it right in LND using command line, maybe there's a website too, pretty sure Invoices are single use

Why you gotta out me 
@_date: 2019-03-25 05:56:03
Yes that's the thing, I can run 5 Google docs, play YouTube and Spotify, etc, the hard drive is new and way better than that, so no clue what's the bottleneck 
@_date: 2019-03-25 05:29:44
pardon the background stuff, but if you can see, I have 8 connections to peers, and a functioning hard drive (1TB) connected via USB3.0. Yet I'm stuck between .1% and .00% progress per hour. It's taken me \~2 weeks to get to 78%. 
This isn't a complaint or attack on BTC, I'd just like my node up and running.

Of course, i completely agree, but it's undeniable that inequality can cause anger and violence, and if societies break down and turn to authoritarianism bc of chaos, that's counterproductive

I absolutely agree, but there are a huge number of luddites nowadays. People who attack what they don't understand and harm what will help them

Great quote, very applicable.

Wow, great thanks!

POW continues as the way to verify blocks, the only thing that changes is there's no block reward, so miners will charge fees to include your transaction in their block.

You don't have to use hardware wallets. Setting up a paper wallet is just as secure and much cheaper. Trezor and other hardware puts a target on your back, and can be confiscated. 
What I did was buy btc on hodl hodl (Bisq is an alternative) and then transfer them to a wasabi wallet for snonimity (coinjoin) and then sent them to a paper wallet 
The coin join part is optional.
