Do you find Bitcoin intimidating? I find that the current media attention on certain aspects of the Bitcoin universe (hacking, volatility etc) is casting a shadow.

What's holding you back?

Do you tend to replenish your bitcoin stash after transacting some?

I think that inflation, QE and other government intervention is the kicker. The majority of people don't have an intuitive understanding of the impact that such actions have on them. eg. inflation is x%, so you now have y% less spending power.

I can see a path to that place too, but, when it gets there, what will $10,000 buy you? I feel that by the time BTC gets to such an exchange rate, nobody will be bothered comparing it to fiat any more (will fiat exist?)

Sure, and just because I am poor now doesn't mean I wont win the lottery tomorrow and change my outlook on life. The question is one of sentiment: how do you currently feel about BTC. Regarding LTC, I am curious to understand why you would favour it over BTC? I can't say that I am an expert in LTC, and I can foresee a world where LTC could be another viable crypto-currency, but, what does LTC have that BTC does not, which would make you favour its growth over BTC?

I guess 3,4 and 6 would equal someone who has a long term positive view for Bitcoin. This is how I feel also.

I think that mining in todays climate is an honourable job, much like providing your CPU cycles to any of the scientific projects on BOINC for example. You probably wont make a profit, but you are providing a valuable service to the community by processing transactions.

I think I share your viewpoint on taxation, but, I also think that its probably a bad thing for bitcoin (in the short term) to make it about tax evasion. My opinion is that the current system of government controlled currency facilitates and enables taxation in a way that pleases the current system of government. Lets face it, the current system of government could not exist without the input of all those tax receipts. In the long term, I can see a world where individuals have more control over where their "tax" is spent, but by then, it probably wont be called tax anymore, and it probably wont be an enforced contribution based on some percentage that is calculated across the board to ensure that the tax receipt income is sufficiently high to satisfy governments.

In addition to the arguments of credit vs. currency:
Chargebacks / Buy now pay later / Perks:
There is no free lunch here. You pay for all these. Escrow and other services will eventually provide the same features in the Bitcoin universe, and you will probably pay for it there also.
Paying my credit card bill is easy: Yes, the current situation with the exchanges is a bit complicated. However, this is still very early days. Further, by spending bitcoin, you are essentially operating in a foreign currency. The exchange issue applies to other foreign currencies too. (As a consumer, why would I want to buy something using EUR instead of credit card)
Eventually, there will be Bitcoin denominated Credit/Debit cards. The issue is one of currency exchange.

As a  (merchant), what is your money-management strategy? I assume that you have a large fiat exposure for "normal" cost of business expenditure. I understand that accepting one form of currency for payment, when most of your expenses are denominated in another currency, leaves you exposed to exchange rate fluctuations that can sometimes lead to increased costs which get passed on to the consumer. Or are you one of the lucky few who are starting to operate in BTC for the majority of their expenses?

I suppose that this is the best approach to get the best of both worlds.

Or, the sophisticated traders are starting to get on board, and finding a world of easily scared "investors" and will push them around all day and all night (or, their robo-trading systems will do it) happily extracting value left, right and centre

Bunch of people getting ready to buy from panic sellers
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:32:25
Yes. It would be great to be able to walk into a high st currency exchange and exchange fiat for bitcoin. (ignoring the fact that these guys usually charge a much higher exchange rate)

Silk Road has been a popular outlet for obvious reasons, but I suspect that a more politically correct, public marketplace would go a long way towards providing options.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:20:13
And how's that working out for you? Also, what are your feelings regarding recent fluctuations?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:24:02
I agree. I am loving how Bitcoin is coming out of the closet, and especially loving how the mainstream media are having major difficulties "simplifying" the concept for the masses. I suspect that there will be a lot of funny video clips to watch back on in a few years.

I posted [my thoughts]( on this last night. I do believe that an efficient market follows a random walk, but we are far from that in Bitcoin now

I bought 1BTC at around the same level, and then bought some mining hardware, for a laugh. I get free electricity, so it was a no brainer. Now I am really getting a kick out of the recent price movements, and my mining hardware investment has paid off. Its a shame that ASIC hardware is still a pipe dream for many. I remember the days when certain graphics cards were constantly out of stock, presumably due to miners demand for them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:34:27
Have you mined much? Or is your investment mainly from exchanging fiat for bitcoin?
