It's been a third time this week as far as I know. Not to mention numerous of deposit and withdrawal problems. I think it was just last week when my DOGE deposit was delayed for 24 hours and 2 days later, my BTC withdrawal got delayed for 4 hours. Ever since then, I stopped using it to avoid further loss since I already lost 5% of my fund over it.

I suggest using Virwox. Their fees are extremely high and having to exchange to SLL first would add roughly 10% fee. However, I couldn't find a single case of chargeback from them in the past 7 years they've been around so this is the safest way to sell bitcoin for paypal as far as I can tell. If you're patient enough, Bitstamp or similar sites would offer better rate but you may have to wait days or weeks for the money to arrive.
You can see the price difference compared to Bitstamp or BTC-E here : caktux.ca/virwox

Exactly. The unbanked tend to be those who don't trust a single entity to hold their funds. If they're quite tech-savvy, then they might adopt bitcoin while securing their fund by themselves using cold wallet methods.  But since most of the unbanked came from the lowest income group, I doubt they even know what a Linux is.

Not if OP is using PayPal or credit card. The fees might be much higher but it's the safest and fastest way to buy Bitcoin with credit card.

I see, I suppose having a good security on both devices  would be enough. What I was worried about is circumvention from code injection in the website but I suppose that'll be unlikely. Thanks for this!

You do realize that even a $1 yearly donation per every reader on medium-traffic blog would be enough to earn them $100,000 which would be a dream compared to ads earning; even for blogs with millions of visitors monthly.
In most cases, relying solely on donation would be ineffective. Even if they promised ad-free browsing upon $1 donation, only less than 0.1% of the total reader would do that.
Source : I have a blog with 300k monthly views, already accepting donation for ad-free experience and tried to be ad-free for the whole month.

Ah, yes. The phishing attack, I always double check the url to prevent this. Thanks for the info!

How is this in r/bitcoin? Is it now normal to recommend bitcoin as a way to avoid tax completely?

I agree that the site in general worked very well. The only two flaws are the fact that it took them a long time to give my ticket and the fact that their booking code didn't seem to work for checking in online since the code came from their wholesaler and combined to a single non-standard code. They did helped me by calling all three airlines involved and verified the booking so in the end, it did worked quite well even though the only way to check-in is to come to the airport directly or by phone.
Thanks for sharing your experience! :)

Yes, all subsequent withdrawal would practically be instant. The first one is always delayed for 48 hours to avoid chargeback.

That was my original fear when I booked with them. I waited for 17 hours with no words after I paid them so I fear that they're unable to book it somehow. They finally managed to book it 15 hours before the flight so I suppose your scenario is highly likely to happen to me and I would ended up paying more or get a refund 12 hours before I'm planning to depart.
I hope for the same, I've booked with Expedia before and it was much smoother than this. I hope they'll accept bitcoin for flight soon. :)

I agree. Bitcoin is a revolutionary payment system and currency but to compare it to bank is just an ignorant comparison. I'm sure eventually there will be banks that integrate Bitcoin into its system and offer the same services as regular bank but for now, a traditional bank is the best option for those services you mentioned.
Elliptic is certainly a pioneer in term of insured bitcoin saving account and with this great beginning, an actual banks with bitcoin system will probably come soon as well.

Thank you for wanting to help me! I've sent an email to you. :)

Actually, I booked it 48 hours before the departure which is early enough in most case. It took them 17 hours to process the ticket and another 5 to reply to me on the online check-in problem. I really hope they could process it faster in the future.
