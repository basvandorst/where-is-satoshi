What are you talking about? If you have "never really bought anything with bitcoin before" how you can speak to the merits of a checkout process?  
I clicked on pay with coin base.  Last pass auto populated my info.  I clicked login.  Done.  That was two clicks home slice.  So easy a Nanobot could do it.

I just posted a few days ago asking if anyone knew of a way to integrate Wave invoicing and Bitcoin (coinbase specifically). It looks like I'm switching accounting platforms.

At some point will the time for confirmations to take place speed up? I'm assuming it's only limited by the computing power in the network?

Thanks. I guess I'm thinking more of a local focus where people who have stuff they want to sell (furniture, video games, etc) can meet up with other bitcoiners face to face to do a transaction. It would promote the community and create REAL value in bitcoin.

Great work! I've been hoping for an iOS wallet for some time. 
In addition to some of the other suggestions in future versions I'd like to see a pass lock option on the app.

How is this a gimmick? The merchant saves around 3% on merchant fees plus there is a markup for anticipated charge backs. Every business should know their chargeback risks. I can't speak for blogging platforms, but if it doesn't make sense for the business they wouldn't do it.

Thank you for the tip!  So 50 millibit (50 mBTC) = .050 BTC = 5 centibit (5 cBTC), right?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:27:10
Yes.  I've reached out to Mt Gox.  Here is their reply:
It looks like they gave you a code of MTGOX-USD-K8F7J-LJ54B-BXKD8-ACFDC
Please redeem the Mt.Gox redeemable code back into your account by copying the code. Then, login and select the Funding options menu. After that, please select the Add Funds page and select Mt.Gox Redeemable Code under the drop-down menu. Paste the code into the box and click redeem. The funds should appear back in your account. If the code does not work, you will have to contact Bitinstant to retrieve your funds.
MtGox.com Team
The code does not work and there are no funds in my account.  If it helps here is the email I received from Bitintant shortly after paying ZipZap:

I really appreciate you helping resolve this.  I'd even be okay if BTC was just sent to my address.  It doesn't necessarily need to be in Mt. Gox
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:20:00
Good point and question. I'm no smarty pants with Bitcoin, but my understanding is that you can elect to skip paying a transaction fee, but it's going to take longer (like several minutes if not hours) to go through. Plus this is obviously not conducive to the network. 
Maybe the fee is just something you would anticipate so make sure to start with enough?

The other thing I've recently realized is that when the internet was becoming a revolution people didn't have a global platform to communicate on, except for those already on the internet. Now with the Bitcoin revolution we have the internet already to rapidly communicate the latest. The growth is exponential.

Thanks for the feedback.  It's nice to know what people are into.  On a side note I'm still impressed with Lance.  Look at what he did on drugs.... I can barely even walk when on them :)
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:59:46
It's a fine line you walk my friend.  I am starving to learn about new services that are accepting bitcoin; especially ones that are exclusively accepting BTC.  
However, high jacking someone elses thread is a bit tacky in my opinion.  If you have a service that the market wants why not promote on your own thread or partner with another services provider BEFORE posting on their thread.  Make sure they are cool with it; ya dig?
I'm not into the gambling scene of things, but I truly wish you and all services that are accepting BTC great success!
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:30:22
Well thank you kindly internet stranger. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 17:44:16
Of course not.  It would be creating a new economy by leveraging their service; ultimately hurting their business once enough adoption has taken place.  
Can PayPal stop something like this?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:34:44
Exactly! Since bitcoin is based on a P2P network independent of a central authority why do we need an exchange that is governed by a small group of individuals?  
I understand that an exchange is connecting buyers and sellers.  There has to be a better way to do this.
@_date: 2013-03-08 02:00:23
Anonymity is a benefit of bitcoin, but not the whole purpose.  One of the biggest hurdles for bitcoin to become widely accepted is finding reasons for people to spend their bitcoins and not just hold on to them with the hopes that they will continue to increase in value.  If they are traded they won't increase in value for long.
It's nice to get feedback on this though to understand people's mindsets.  Ideally the site would not be about trading drugs, sex or illegal items, but give supporters of bitcoin a real reason to buy and sell things with bitcoin, thus promoting trade and overall creating a sustainable currency.  It's one small piece of the puzzle, but I think it would help if people would support it.
@_date: 2013-03-10 18:54:32
This is great!  This is exactly how I see widespread adoption of bitcoin happening.  Local small business is what brings innovation to the world.  In order to get the masses to become interested and use bitcoin they need exposure  at the places they frequent.  
Here at r/bitcoin we have a ton of great information that helps shorten the learning curve for non-techies.  Unfortunately, the general public will NEVER seek out what bitcoin is though.  It needs to be presented to them with a short explanation for why they should use it and how to get started and this is the perfect way to do it!
I'm not a graphic designer, but you may want to reach out to u/howtovanish.  They shared [this]( info graphic that I believe they created.  Maybe they could help with a printable flier?  
Please share the flier you end up using and let us know the results!

Like many have mentioned it's very hard to predict what will happen due to the fact that nothing like Bitcoin has ever existed.  
With that said I believe that the majority of the value increase is being driven by your  point.  That is what is creating the exciting, sleepless nights and workless days for a lot of people.  
For bitcoin to remain at a "high value" it needs application.  It will not be a good long term investment if their is no circulation.  Gold works because it's something that everyone gets.  It's physical and can be used for practical everyday things amongst other reasons.  Most people don't get what Bitcoin actually is or how they can use it. A lot of "investors" who are buying are only doing so because they see a nice fancy curve going upward.  
The point I'm trying to make here is that Bitcoin is like new fertile soil.  Point  is like a seed.  Point  is the water and sun which is going to make a massive ass tree with deep roots.  I just hope that  gets as much energy as   or all who are banking on bitcoin will not be happy.
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:45:56
It's crazy how the market can be so easily manipulated. I'm not saying you aren't legit, but who's to say that you didn't gobble up a bunch of shares a while back and are getting ready to sell off everything? All you need is to create a little hype to make the price shoot up and BAM! A big sell off.

Oh, and the "good" white elephant gift parties ahead too. Much conversation will be had.

Bitcoin is an emerging digital currency that isn't regulated by any government, but a peer to peer network. It's value is completely determined by the market's supply and demand. 
No banks, nominal fees, international, secure and bad ass!
You will see bitcoin all over the world being accept by many many merchants. Just remember you heard it here first. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 00:27:41
I guess I haven't wrapped my head around this yet.  For bitcoin to really thrive it has to, at some point, be easily adapted into local small businesses.  What I was imagining with this paper wallet was that it would function similar to a preloaded Visa.  But what I'm understanding from you and jan is that is just not the case.  
Here is what I'm thinking would be ideal and please tell me if there is a better way: 
1) Consumer prints off a paper wallet with both public and private keys in QR form.
2) Consumer loads BTC on it (similar to carrying cash in their "regular" wallet)
3) Consumer gets hungry
4) Consumer goes to a pizza place to order and they accept BTC!
5) Business is setup with an app that can scan a QR code on a paper wallet to transfer the exact amount owed.
6) Consumer's paper wallet has the amount owed deducted from it and the remaining balance stays there.
7) Business is happy because their transaction fees were .0005 BTC and made a sale
8) Consumer eats delicious pizza.
I am incorrect in the possibility of this process?
Tldr: Can't paper wallets be used similar to prepaid Visa?
@_date: 2013-03-16 18:18:09
Have you had personal experience using this site?  I'm curious what the turn around time is specifically for PayPal funds.
Their process seems longer than it needs to be.
1) Setup account
2) Get activation code via email
3) Activate account
4) Login
5) Add PayPal email to my profile
6) Fill out bitcoin sell form
7) Create Sells Order
8) Not sure what happens after that because after entering 1BTC I received the following message: Quantity to sell exceeds maximum payable funds or payment option is out of funds
What I would like to see is:
1) Create account with email and password (I'm logged in now)
2) Have an easy to see bitcoin address to send funds to that is unique to my login
3) Enter PayPal email and send coins to the address created for me
4) See money in my PayPal account in less than an hour

Same here.  It's fast as long as you send to a BTC address and not your Mt. Gox account

@_date: 2013-04-21 19:20:47
I don't quite understand your comment. When you say "you ate supporting bitcoins" do you mean you *aren't* supporting bitcoins?
The price is in USD, but when you check out through bitpay it is in BTC.  USD is only a reference point when there is so much volatility at this point.  
As the site states I'm accepting BTC only.

Add another one to the list.  I wanted money in Mt. Gox so I could quickly buy during the next dip.  It's been 6 days there is still no money in my Mt. Gox account.  Bitinsitant sent an email saying they transfered the funds a few minutes after I did a money gram.  I've reached out to Mt Gox and they are pointing the finger at Bitinstant and Bitinstant is completely quiet on the issue.   
Granted it's only $100, but the time and frustration its caused feels more like a grand.  There has been no ETA and not even a confirmation that they have received my inquiry.  
This is definitely part of the reason why the price is going up so quickly.  At least I can thank these terrible services for helping to increase the value of my current BTC.

I'm happy to hear about the utility Bitcoin is providing in your life. 
I do have a few questions since you are unique in that you are voluntarily homeless; if you don't mind. 
1. Where do you sleep?
2. How do you do mobile transactions? (I'm assuming you don't have a smartphone)
3. Do you beg for money/food?
4. If no to 3, how do you get food?

I'm curious if the community would like something like this?  There is no site yet, just the images. 10% of the proceeds will be donated to [HDSA]( (Huntington's Disease of America).

Circulate BTC to help the market. Wear a wristband to start conversations.  Support charity. Spread the word!

Google is an innovative company.  The fact that they are offering a simple ad hoc process to send money peer to peer validates the demand for a way to send currency digitally.  
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:04:43
If made illegal merchants won't be willing to accept bitcoins at their place of business. Bitcoin can still moderately thrive peer to peer but I think we all want to see full acceptance as a THE currency everyone uses.
