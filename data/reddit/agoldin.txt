It took only few stern demands from Congress for Twitter and Facebook to produce the bestest and the reliablest  algorithmically selected and therefore 100 percent reliably identified posts of Russian trolls fake news which, as I was told, ruined American democracy, so you are obviously badly mistaken.

Go to Guatemala and start a company that exchanges bitcoin into dollars or local currency. Make some money for yourself in a process.
Just a thought.

"No war" US  president is clearly impossible at this point in time, but there is still a small chance Trump may turn out "less war" president than usual. Although getting rid of  INF treaty does not make me feel good.

So far Bitcoin was banned in Russia something like 10 times, however it is still not illegal.
Most of the news about Russia are overblown, over sensationalized or just made up. Do not forget we are in the beginning of Cold War 2.0, new and improved.

Start the business then. If you write a plausible business plan, the banks or investors will throw money at you.
