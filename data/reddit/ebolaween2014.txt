I blame Ver. He is the one trying to mislead people which gives this terrible impression to all.
I use to be a staunch pro Core advocate but now I am less sure or even more on the side of Cash
People want to start using their Bitcoin again, and Blockstream has never allowed this to happen. They could not wait any longer.

they said before Jan 1 they would credit. theres a lot of demand and it doesnt cost them anything to list once they built everything else

So Bitcoin transactions are better because the fee is ALWAYS under 2.90 gbp?

there's demand so people will buy it. I dont subscribe to he idea that people are being mislead. I dont like the zealotry and the "oh call it SegWitCoin"  but its obviously a competitor and people want it.

I'm sorry if Coinbase hurt your feelings and your portfolio, surely the surge hurt mine too, but the truth is that your feelings equate to nothing.
The amount of money they will make vastly outweighs the people who buy coins through Coinbase, as (disregarding GDAX), these people are novices to the ecosystem and the more serious investors and traders have moved their fiat purchases to another platform.
If you really cared you would have stopped using their platforms after NYA/2X.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:57:41
And I'm telling you that they did as the advertised. They deemed that trading was acceptable as there was demand and it was done. If anything they have gained respect from Cash supporters. I do think that they should support Segwit but I dont think that listing Cash was wrong or that the sentiments of the vocal minority and those such as Whalepanda, &amp;c matter in the long run. Exchanges wax and wane.

I know what a fork is, xaxa. But your analogy isn't the best...I don't think ABC and the other development teams have given up, with an upgrade fork coming soon. Let's take Ubuntu as a better analogue:
Ubuntu is also a fork of Debian, and some Debian users hate Ubuntu for it's developer's choices, but some welcome those changes and prefer it to Debian, and vice versa. Some appreciate them both for their differences and use both for different purposes, as do I. Canonical is a big development team as are Debian's teams.
Jokes aside, what's wrong with explaining to a curious user who clicks a link that BCH is a fork, and it proposes on-chain scaling and 0-conf, as opposed to BTC's off-chain scaling focuses, such as the Lightning Network?

Perhaps they could provide some information about each chain instead of directing the confused user to use Bitcoin Core, although if they don't known that's likely what they wanted

@_date: 2018-05-07 17:24:10
I get what you're saying, but here's my take.
The whitepaper sets out (contested) definitions and if Debian set out to not use something like systemd in their whitepaper, and then did, I think Devuan would have some right to claim that they are the true Debian.
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:00:21
Permissionless means that no one can tell you what to do. Again, he didn't create Bitcoin Cash, but the devs that did have every right to do whatever they want.
Open source promotes the freedom of the user to modify the content in any way they desire. You're wrong. Go read what RMS thinks on free software.

I think Ver has good intentions, but of course he is in it to make money too... I'm only concerned with the scaling debate.
If Ver settled for BCH over S2X, doesn't that rule out "scam" since S2X had no replay protection?

Try whatever investment strategy you want, but I'm a trader. 
It's not unreasonable to recommend that people sell on a high and buy lower. I'm not saying that I have a crystal ball that told me to sell on Dec 17 2017.

@_date: 2018-06-30 17:09:11
Trying to make me FOMO is ridiculous. I've loved crypto since I discovered it in 2014, your notion of me being a salty nocoiner is wrong. 
I make comments on r/Bitcoin like this often because I don't like the the outlook of new, more "normal" community members. I see a lot of people, mostly those who are green posting and posting article and article and sentiment about how Bitcoin is great, or is predicted, or why I'm holding, &amp;c. 
Let's not kid ourselves, Bitcoin has crashed. Bitcoin is still a great asset as is many other entries in the crypto space.
But new market cycles emerge from crashes. Anyone's guess could be right, but let's not post articles from the corporate media that tried to delegitimize cryptos for years on reddit to try to make ourselves feel more confident in the future. Giving them clicks feels wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:50:44
Why does everyone think this? We are in a bear market, not everyone bearish is salty.

@_date: 2018-06-30 15:47:53
why does everyone take me for a fool? falling 70% isn't bullish but by no means is BTC "over"
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:40:04

While I think a majority of this sub will disagree with me, big blocks are the only way to scale efficiently without layer-2 solutions and technical workarounds. Sometimes the pressure release valve is a better option than re-engineering the entire boiler. 
That and 0-conf. I don't really like 0-conf because of the danger that congestion brings, but if blocks are big enough and there is a way to prevent attackers from flooding the network it will be a valuable asset for near instant txns.   
E: Although I've been told that network congestion does not affect 0-conf in regard to double spending, so if that is true (I have to research it), I think that it is a very good tool for faster-than-Visa speeds.

Trade as you will. Flip utility tokens when they are hot and dump them when you've made some profit. Don't ever hold them through an alt glut because most of them have no fundamental value.
 Play around on Bitmex with a few % of your portfolio and try to win big.

The break upwards from the historical ratio between the price and certain EMAs was concerning. The bull trap was damning. There were many signs.

@_date: 2018-04-15 13:44:39
Since BTC and BCH fees are about the same right now, I think both camps need to work on  scaling on and off chain. Enough with the fighting over who said what and on with development. I'm not happy with just LN. There needs to be competition in the off chain space. BCH has a few up and coming ease-of-use projects like MicroPOS and Ka-ching.

Gold and Silver for 1000s of years have been the go-to currency. These are both inflationary, yet self regulating. As they increase in price (demand), more mining investment causes supply to exceed demand and the price corrects. Bitcoin's block reward may become a challenge in the future. I prefer the idea of a block reward based on the hash rate, as this would mimic precious metals, and eliminate selfish mining. (See Rothbard's Disciple's video on "Why Zcoin should fork" to learn about different inflation methods).

@_date: 2018-07-01 04:20:35
It would definitely affect the market. This is simple supply and demand.
OTC doesn't happen much father above market price--when buying in large volumes during times of high demand. Usually OTC is conducted under market value. A possible 1 000 000 BTC up for sale would increase supply immensely, dwarfing the demand at market value. Think, where would those cheap coins go immediately after purchase? The price would drop because Satoshi wanted to remain anonymous and moving the coins breaks his streak of silence. In all likelihood the agent moving the coins is not Satoshi. So the answer is that he wouldn't ever move the coins in those early blocks, and it would affect the demand for BTC at market value drastically.
