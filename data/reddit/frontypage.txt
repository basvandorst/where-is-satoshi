By the way your information comes directly from the Tobacco Lobby. You aren't even vaping. Big tobacco is trying to regulate the market. I participated in this industry. In the 90s "the big 5" sweared tobacco is not harmful.

OK, so can I have your BCH adress?

But they can't do anything about their competitors. IQOS is a pretty dumb product, a solution which banks may have in Crypto. 
Nobody thought 10 years ago Electronic Cigarettes will become regular like today. Look at the improvements in E-Cigs and Crypto within 10 Years.

I would trade much more if Lightning TX would be possible between exchanges.
Now I always have to worry that my coins will not arrive on time and it's too expensive to move them.
I think most customers really want to see Lightning Networks on Exchanges and will automatically only choose them. To choose a exchange which supports Lightning will save you a lot of bucks!
So all other exchanges will have pressure to integrate it.
I can't comment on your other arguments.

There is no single source who controls the world.

Can't we just leave Wall Street and Crypto?
If anybody is going bullish on Bitcoin on Wallstreet, they will just quit their job. CME futures may only be traded by Crypto Hedge Funds. I consider stuff like above is like ... Amazon will accept BTC in 2017. Still I am Hodling my portfolio, because of my vision for the decentralized Internet and BTC as payment method.

Don't try to trade.
Watch the markets for a few years.
Maybe you find an other investment opportunity in which you beleive.
Don't invest in Coins which are somehow very often mentioned on reddit for a period of time.

When you realize bitcoin is backed by precious resources (graphic cards) and co2 consumption. (energy)
But mostly it is backed by the community, like the USD.

You are speaking about the main source of power in the US and over 50% of Americans have voted against it.
Their are Dozens of other "Sources of Power" including the Chinese Party, Russians and even the Infowars movement.
Something will always be "established" somewhere.
Crypto could also be "the establishment" in the future and is as well a Source of Power.
Times can easily change, and as long as everybody has control over their lives in a free society, they are able to change the World. While it is often enough to change their world.

However this was the only BTC trade where you really could profit within the last few years. Except a long from the beginning / during the rally.
But it was predictable and about time. I was hodling as well because of my experience.
And I think the memepool was maybe spammed, so whales have an advantage in selling?
Do you have an prediction about a new all time high?

Is something decentralized if a 3rd party cuts a profit? In my opinion not.
For me, it would even mean it is working without employees as well if something is decentralized.
Maybe you should try to decentralize yourself and see if you rather don't want to be centralized.
Sorry... ;)

John Mc Afee is full of shit and of course, he will NOT eat his own penis on TV, when this goal is not reached. He sold his business for 100 million before the Dotcom bubble and did nothing else than cocaine, hookers, paid crypto tweets and other shitshows 20 years afterwards. Do a quick research and ask yourself would you trust him rather than Donald Trump.... Hell, Roger Ver is more trustworthy.
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:32:54
Because "Decentralized" is just a fucking buzzword.
You even could print that on a Coca Cola can and it would be more true ...

You'll receive BTC and going to spend it on coffees with a fee of a few dollars each? 
You send money within US often using Western Union and above fee? You don't have free ways? Dwolla, Bank Transfer etc?
In FX you can do transactions from 0,21€ for 50 Euro to USD from my Debit Card / Bank Account in Europe to your Bank Account in USA. 
I don't want to tell you which type of payments you are in for 10%. But for them BTC may makes more sense.

In my opinion it will reach 50.000 - 100k in 2020 - 2022.
It will be the peak of another bubble and they will tell you we will reach 1 million because of this chart.
However, I think we will also reach 1000 - 3000$ in 2018 or 2019.

I do not live there anymore and I've chosen BTC and paying no Taxes as long UBI doesn't exist.
I would do so, if the UBI is the only thing the state is providing. Nothing else and no agencies. I even would like to see the state is not providing education / schools. Instead the pupils are paying for it with their UBI.

IMHO the universal basic income makes totally sense in 1st world countries, rather than to spend it on social or military budget. I am not talking about BTC here, but on the monetary system in general. The impact of Universal Basic income in all regards is better than the current distribution of wealth or the BTC POW.

There's even a neo liberal form of UBI.
In the country where I am from it makes completely sense, but I don't want to argue. You should learn about it. I also thought it makes no sense, exaclty what I thought about BTC when I heard it the first time.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:09:51
Makes sense to have a lean state which doesn't waste money and will lead to a great future. (Most good crypto is also open source and people don't get paid for work)
Makes sense if we replace workers with machines.
UBI is liberal.

I cashed out most and stay away from this market for a while.
I will be back to find the great stuff in the shards.
However I also thought like this guy, until I came accross Bitcoin Maximalism.
Bitcoin MUST win as a digital peer to peer currency. Everything else would be TERRIBLE. There are SO many reasons and people don't get it.
Do only invest in things which Bitcoin can not solve. For the rest there is BTC in Crypto.

Bitcoins move from currency to store of value (Digital Gold) will have a high appeal when it actually can be used as a currency again.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:13:25
They never had. However they work as a processor for a bunch of methods. For now this just means you also can choose for example bill payments at ebay in some countries. I even assume ebay will continue to work with PayPal through adyen, as it is a popular checkout option. 
Adyens focus currently is also only processing methods, which means that for example BitPay would have to be integrated with Adyen. (I think)
But I am really positive on Adyen that they do not want to miss out on Crypto, if we make it a reliable payment option. :)
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:37:08
This is as likely to happen than Amazon adopts Bitcoin in 2017.
