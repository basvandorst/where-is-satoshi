This debate is stupid. Dollars has $ and ¢. Bitcoin can have m and u. And if you ever see a price without units, dude, those are whole fucking coins.

Yea. I imagine we wont use raw btc addresses much in the future. Instead we'll "send" bitcoins to a QR code for  and rely on the existing ~~web of trust~~ certificate authorities for verification. Of course this makes it easy to for small purchase insurers and escrows to help verify claims so it will happen. It will then be trivial to whitelist coins by their history. No amount of tumbling will make dirty bitcoins pure since the government will go after the first whitelisted (and TLS verified) address to pass the funds. Yea... I extrapolated a bit. But we will at least see https being used for seamless address verification soon.

Nothing wrong with paying. It's probably a good investment. But! I once trusted a third party and lost 30 BTC. I will never trust a third party again.

Why not just encrypt it and put it on Google drive?

I'm just going to walk around with QR code stickers and put them on existing advertisements for charity, covering the old ones if necessary.

Not really. When I was just starting out mybitcoin.com vaporized with my 30 BTC.
