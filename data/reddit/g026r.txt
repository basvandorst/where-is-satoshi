OK, so let's walk this argument through:
Normally, when demand outstrips supply, the central bank will intervene to increase the supply. This, in turn, leads to inflation. Since bitcoin has no central bank, this is not an option. (Natch.) Instead, what you are suggesting is that we increase the degree to which we can subdivide a single bitcoin whilst simultaneously keeping the supply constant.  
  
So where before the minimum amount that one could pay or be paid was 1x10^8, now the minimum is 1x10^9.  
Now, in order for this to actually make any sort of sense, people actually have to start using this new smaller amount&amp;mdash; transactions have to occur where the value of them is at 9 decimal places. In other words, everything &amp;mdash; prices, transaction fees, and payments for mining&amp;mdash;has to drop and that 1 BTC that you were holding on to has now increased in value.
Or, to boil your argument down: "It's not deflationary because it's deflationary."

Well you've certainly convinced me. /s  
  
Care to actually explain your reasoning, rather than just declaring it so? Because the only argument I can possibly pull out of your comment is as follows: "Bitcoin is not deflationary because, if we ever need more in order to meet rising demand, we can always subdivide it into smaller and smaller amounts."  
  
Am I reading it right? Is that your argument?

OK. Well and good. But why not? Because this sentence:  


  
isn't an argument for it not being deflationary.
