Thanks, I will stick with Gemini for now. But if anything, I'll check it out.

I guess part of my frustration also comes from them lowering my weekly purchase limit with no reason. It was set to $1,000 when I first opened my account, then the next day I find out it's been lowered to $240. And even if I wanted to, I STILL can't make purchases through Coinbase. "As a new user you may only purchase up to $250 initially. Please wait until your first pruchase completes or try smaller amount." I can't even purchase $3.. it shows same message.
With Bitcoin price surging, it's obvious that I'd like to get in as much as I can but Coinbase is barring me from doing that.

Why does Coinbase take so long when Gemini doesn't? The payment methods were the same with same bank account. To me, there is zero excuse.

I understand that waiting few days isn't a big deal, I get that. But that's not the point. Point is Coinbase vs Gemini. It clearly is possible for transactions to be cleared sooner and Gemini proved that with my case.
So why would I ever want to deal with service that is slower than the guy nextdoor who offers the exact same service but quicker?

I have a question. When I go into Buy section in Coinbase, it gives me $9,6077.99 = 1BTC.
But when I go into Sell section, 1BTC = $9,527.00
Why is there $80 difference between buying price and selling price? I just don't get it..
If someone is selling BTC at 96077.99 for me to buy, I should be able to sell my BTC at that price..
I swear to God CB is full of shit.

No, I know that each day the purchase limit is freed by certain amount or percentage.. But as of now, the green bar is full, indicating my weekly purchase limit is in fact $250. BUT I can't make any purchase UNTIL my initial purchase of $500 is fully cleared. I bought $500 worth last week at $81xx = 1BTC. Right now 1BTC = $9600. And I can't buy any or even if I wanted to, I can't sell.. pfffft

I am verified. Oh and thank you for reminding me. I had to send Coinbase pictures of my Drivers License over 3 times for them to successfully verify my identity. THE SAME PICTURE 3 TIMES.
Also, I think you're talking about purchasing via debit/credit card. From what I understand purchases made with debit/credit cards are available instant but higher transaction fee.
Not sure if I'm the one who doesn't understand.. But I'm willing to be corrected.

It took me one overnight to get verified with Gemini. But since I've been verified, it's been such a better experience than Coinbase.

I am verified. I think you might be talking about purchasing with debit/credit card. ACH bank transfers take 7-10 days. Even adding funds into my Coinbase USD wallet takes 7-10 days.

Yup, and they give pre-credit until your transfer fully clears so you can start trading immediately. I have no idea why anyone would stay with Coinbase. Makes no sense to me.
