Please show me any system that meets this spec. Bitcoin, despite all of its glorious innovation cannot deliver this. Nothing can (it's too general). 


Sounds like an ethos to me.
If you truly believe you can produce something that 'can't be evil', then I question whether you're naive, delusional, or just a raging marketer. 
I appreciate the spirit of what you're trying to accomplish but don't start believing your own hype. Best of luck, however.

Thank you for understanding :)
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:16:01


that's my point. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 00:18:27


I'd love nothing more than to have this financed by the people, for the people, perhaps with a legally binding 'will not sell to Facebook' clause? I'd be down for that. 


That was my thought as well, to date it hasn't proven viral exactly lol, but we're making inroads and growing at about 50% per month in terms of unique visitors. Small numbers of course, but we have high hopes. 


Thanks! Are you my long lost brother?
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:28:35
yeah considering changetip too, good thought. 
EDIT: yeah a satoshi is nothing, but it grows in lock step with our Treasury and our membership. Plus there are future payment growth opportunities too, like if the members vote to have ads, revenue from that would hit the treasury, which would get distributed to members, for example. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 00:40:08
oh yeah, let me be clear, wasn't asking for money, sorry if I left that impression. the fund raising thing just came up during discussion. our first act looks like it's going to be micro-lending to earn interest for said treasury (borrower TBD by vote). 
@_date: 2014-11-08 00:52:27
Thank you, means a lot actually :)
It's unusual to see someone so new to the site to grasp it so quickly - it's good to see I'm not the only crazy one haha
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:40:19
Thanks, and yeah, we're not trying to make the argument that you should use the site for meaningful payment, it's more about the concept and philosophy. :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:08:22
I hear you, but I think even if that's true, it forces us into more creative solutions for building the treasury such as the collecting interest through micro-lending example. 
But, I'm not sure it is true. Once it delivers enough value to its members, some (not all) will contribute voluntarily. Like Wikipedia, for example. I'm not arguing we're there yet, I'm just making a theoretical point. 
And again, we're not asking anyone to contribute, just to be clear :)
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:23:19
Sure, and I wouldn't expect you to live up to the impossible, but that's also why the 'ethos' part of this discussion is important. Because you're going to need to make choices in the pursuit of your ambitions and they're going to be guided by an ethos - one that should continue to strive towards 'can't do evil' or 'don't do evil'...Anyway I think we're on the same page here. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 23:06:02
will do, thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 01:48:51
I understood your meaning, but we both know everything can be(come) evil. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:28:53
great idea, thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:53:40


Jeebus, I didn't even think of that, brilliant. 
Per your point about Reddit, yes, it doesn't want to be a Reddit clone, but that's a starting point. 
And you're kind of reading my mind. 2 things we want to do when we're up for the task (we have 0 resources or backing) is: 
1) open source the whole thing
2) decentralize it ala Diaspora
I didn't want to mention that because I hate to make people think I'm selling vaporware, but since you brought it up :)
Also, thanks, adding to the treasury!
@_date: 2014-12-31 23:05:51
thanks! and I swear this isn't a self-post :)
@_date: 2014-11-08 15:38:39
Ok, but you see we're not asking you (or anyone else) to contribute capital to our treasury, right? 
Also, I'm not really sure what your argument is against, government in general? This is a more libertarian approach than any I'm familiar with...Unless I'm misunderstanding you...
@_date: 2014-11-17 22:59:03
The confused clash of socialist-libertarianism in this sub-reddit can be frustrating. I, for one, am excited to see what you guys can do (but please adhere to the 'can't be evil' ethos :) 
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:39:14
that's a risk we have to defend ourselves against. I'm certain theft will happen. That's why we need to create a robust government to protect against it. 
When that corrupts (what government doesn't?) we'll start allowing for costless secession, where anywhere can start a 'country' with their own political systems, leaders, rules, and treasury. 
We need help with this project though. It's quite ambitious. HELP!
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:31:44
thanks for the response. A good idea, but I get blank stares even when I mention Bitcoin to new members, I'd hate to think what I'll get if I go 'alt-alt'.
Coinbase solution looking better and better. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:39:55
Thanks - and as much as I like the meaning of the name, you're absolutely right - it's a bit bad for marketing (something I'm terrible at, admittedly). 
Per your suggestion, I thought about a tax, but few would agree to it (in addition to any philosophical problems I may have with it).  However, I like the idea we talked about in the thread on Empeopled: micro-lending via group vote to gain interest for the treasury. Thoughts?
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:45:53
like [empeopled](
Not quite what you mean, but we have a communal treasury governed by democratic process and denominated in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:20:45
yes, he's our best content creator in that sense. We don't have that anywhere, but their level is meant to indicate their standing in the community (click on his profile). Also the amount of sBTC he's collected is approximately indicative. I'd love to create a list of standings, but I'm afraid of overly gameifying it. What do you think? should we have that?
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:39:30
Thank you, please join us :)
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:35:34
I guess I don't understand what you're saying. Do you believe that by virtue of developing Bitcoin sidechains your company 'can't be evil'? I understand why its catchy and witty based on the limited 'trust-less' nature inherent to Bitcoin - but don't you think taking it further than that is intellectually dishonest?
