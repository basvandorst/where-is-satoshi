This could not possibly be more correct.

Good luck forcing Amazon to do anything.

IIRC, JPM was forced to take government bailout money.

I can tell you this is a problem right here:


Nothing, really.

It was at the time of my reply.

I think this is a little premature.

Good substance.

This couldn't be more true. In order for this technology to continue to catch on, we can't treat people as if they can't be part of the cool kids club.

When you initiate a bank transfer, you can trade on the balance immediately. Even as the transfer has not technically cleared your bank yet. Nice perk.

Yep, process is smooth as butter.

Good question. I have not yet tried to get anything out of Gemini.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:14:11
I'm not sure about the availability of BTC if you transfer BTC to your Gemini account. I can only speak for the availability of USD for trading when you transfer from your bank.

Good question. To me, that seems to be flirting with kiting, but I wouldn't see why not.
