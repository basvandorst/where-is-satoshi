A falafel is the middle eastern way of saying you can buy a Big Mac with it, the idea you can buy a meal with bitcoin says it all...
The average person can't understand beyond the value as 'Internet Money' for bitcoin, some can understand the value as decentralized money but only few can understand the real value of bitcoin, but botcoin needs the people to use it.

Regardless that your comment is irrelevant for this post, If you don't know the facts about Israel please don't talk about it!
You can start here:

The only reason missile didn't take large casualties is because Israel spend a lot of money in intercepting missile and alert system, while Hamas spend the same for building tunnels for attacking civilians and hiding the head of Hamas under gaza!

I guess you didn't watch the video,
Condemning Israel for what? Protecting its citizens (about 20% Muslims) from terrorist attacks, missiles and rockets attacks in their territory?
If you ain't got a solution don't bother answer me!

As a business owner I can understand the reason for him to ask people to buy for 25$ as this may be the only sale this month in bitcoin...

What about the time he have to spend for exchanging to USD for 1.5$ it's not worth the trouble, if he need to wait until he have enough to do with it something I'm not sure as a business it's smart to get bitcoin if your not going to keep them or using a payment processing like bitpay.
 
I guess he is talking about volatility as he have to get enough before he exchange it, meanwhile he pays he's bills and taxes in USD.

Just another troll!!!

I guess he's not using the advantage of accepting bitcoin as he should, he had an opportunity to get published on TV to be a pioneer for using new technology but didn't take it....

Remember, at this time he is a newbie to bitcoin... You can see at the end he took some effort to teach someone to accept bitcoin.
