Don't sell it when it drops below $3663.65.  Don't sell it when it reaches $5,000.

A lot of people said the same thing years, months and weeks ago.  They are happy now.

Aaand we're back to a gain on the day.

While ~~he~~ she very well may not be the author, ~~his~~ her post history backs up  ~~his~~ her claim. So no, you don't have the same amount of evidence.

Related question, I have a Trezor coming. Am I going to have to pay a fee to transfer my btc from Coinbase to the Trezor?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:56:28
I'm buying. I think we're done with the plummet.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:34:12
What's going on with Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:46:42
I bought some right before it crashed via bank transfer. Hoping it went through. I did get an email confirmation...

Bought at maximum dip right before coinbase crashed. Feeling good! Hedl the rest.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:52:25
You think trying to convince people to sell on reddit is really going to help you buy low? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:04:12
I bought after the dip, right before the rise we're on now. But coinbase crashed right when that rise began.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:45:50
No one really knows. We rose pretty fast, lots of people thought we were due for a dip.  Big holder(s) may have sold off a lot starting a big dump from non-hodlers.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:08:52
Whoops, my bad! I'll edit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:42:27
As of two minutes ago
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:16:48
While we'll certainly dip below. It's always nice hitting a new threshold.  Gives people confidence that no matter what happens, it *can* get back to said threshold.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:20:56
And we've dropped $150 in about 5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:49:19
Good call.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:32:47
We haven't hit the bottom.

there* typo in title.

Thanks for sharing.
I was late to the bitcoin game but thanks to people like you I bought myself a Trezor and will be storing all crypto on there.  I'm still pretty paranoid and I double check my Trezor regularly just to be sure.
Wish you happiness and prosperity my friend!
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:29:39
Thanks for including that the Trezor USB cable sucks.  It worked fine for me and then shit the bed out of nowhere within the first couple days. I just trashed it.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:45:21


But for how long? Decades from now, does it really seem so unrealistic that a "better" cryptocurrency will be the "top dog?"  Bitcoin seems profitable to me for a long time to come but I'm curious about what cryptocurrencies will look like 50 years from now. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:04:04
Thanks! Is there any downside to reusing old addresses?

Some people here said it was BTC reached $10, some said it was when it hit $100, some said it was when it hit $1,000. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:00:32
I really should have bought when it was hovering around 2500 for the longest time.
