That is the same link as above.  Looks too small

Body of Chain Head:
The missing 18.5 minutes on the presidential recordings of Richard Nixon has had many theories about what happened to them and who may have erased them.
This audio file has been compiled from a number of sources connected to the Watergate Scandal that brought down a president. 
 Thank you to nixontapes.org for making other presidential tapes available to the public.
 Thank you to wikipedia for general background.
 Thank you to our unnamed sources for making this possible.

We've assembled the 'missing minutes' file.
Nope. Not a PR Stunt.

Were the messages signed?

Those look like large entries.  Entries can be up to 10k bytes.  A 10k entry would cost 10 Entry credits.  209 10k entries would have costed about 1 factoid.

We have run through our service and believe it is ready for outside input.  Please be sure to look at the PROMOTIONS link.  It mentions that we are up in 14 states and currently use 7 currencies (and sweetens the deal)  Any input you can provide is appreciated.  We are looking for what direction the community wants our services to go.

I have to wonder what the motivation was behind this article.  I expect my mother to give me a worried call that my involvement with bitcoin means I am neck deep with mob gambling organizations....No Mom.  I'm not.
We are trying to bring Bitcoin and other crypto currencies to the mainstream.  I fully expect that in the near future, most bitcoin traffic is not going to be on the blockchain any more than the dollars in your bank account are actually floating around somewhere as paper bills.
The mainstream isn't going to read past the headlines.  Was that the point?

Simple comment first.  not trying to be argumentative.  just pointing out that I can't do any of those things with Pesos where I live either.  I can probably find individuals that would take Pesos, but it has the same issue as Bitcoin.  I can go to the local farmers market and buy eggs for bitcoin.  I can probably find someone willing to take Peso also.
My real comment....
Bitcoin is in the early adopters phase.  Where in the phase is subject to debate, but you can't expect a comprehensive ecosystem to exist when bitcoin was clearly in the innovators stage a just a year or two ago.  As it is more widely accepted, you will need to exchange for the local fiat currency less and less often.
The ecosystem is being built right now.   Don't dismiss Bitcoin (or some of the others) because the systems aren't here already.

Only today.  Look how far usability has come in the last two months.
@_date: 2013-08-05 15:13:46
We are pretty much saying the same thing.  difficulty will put them out.  Unless your electricity is free.  The 4.5 gh is decent if you have it plugged in today.  I am curious what will happen when the asic bubble pops.  Consolidates is probably a better word.  How much will a 60 GH asic device be worth when the hashrate is 10 petahashes per second?  Either the hardware will go down or bitcoin value will go up.....  This is where I should probably put links to similar threads all over the internet.
@_date: 2013-08-05 14:28:06
blockchain.info has the network hashrate at 400,000 GH/s (8/5/13).  at 25 bitcoin per block, your $260 for 4.5 gh/s gets about a 1 in 90,000 chance of being the miner that gets the currently $2500 in bitcoin.  That is today.  ASICs shipping make comments about network hashrates exceeding 1000 TH/s (1 PH/s?) a common theme.  a month/year from now, how much income will 4.5 gh bring in?  I am not saying noone will do it, but (my opinion) there will not be enough individuals to maintain it.  would you spend $250 for a 1:250,000 chance at getting $2500?  or whatever that would translate to in a pool?

That would have to assume that you have you have the disposable income to purchase the bitcoins.  You would be replacing effectively free (after hardware and electricity) bitcoins with purchased bitcoins.  Unless you are going to change a regular hardware expense into a regular bitcoin expense, you have only lost the subsidy, not just redirected it.  OR, repurpose your hardware to mine alt coins and turn those into bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:55:28
I personally hope they move to altcoins.  A number of them have already moved to Litecoins.  Regardless of what you think about altcoins, adding to their network hash rates increases the stability of their blockchains.  I do not expect most altcoins to succeed, but it would be a shame to see an otherwise honest coin destroyed by a malicious 51% attack because people aren't mining.  Bitcoin is large enough to exclude the average user from mining.  I expect it will eventually be tens of organizations (pools/exchanges/payment systems) instead of millions of people mining the blockchain.  They will do it because they have an interest in the ecosystem's health instead of just getting bitcoin.
