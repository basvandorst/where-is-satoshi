[Here's]( my prediction. BTC is still overvalued right now, but will probably reach 100K a year or two before 2025, depending on the upswing in the next hype phase.

If Segwit is any indication, it's going to take years. By then other crypto might as well take the lead. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:07:57
Exactly. And seeing how the hype always precedes the trend, I reckon BTC could reach 100K two or three years before the predicted date. So sometime around 2022, perhaps.

I happen to live in Cologne. The media, especially the US media pursuing a political agenda against the Middle east since 9/11 took it way out of porportion. I bet if you count all the parties in New York in a night, there's probably more sexism and sexual abuse there than the entire new years Fiasko in Cologne. The reason it became such a big deal is that women here are more respected then the likes of you would understand. Your fucking president dismisses "grab em by the pussy" as locker room  talk. In Germany a politician saying this would lose his credibility, popularity and career in an hour, beyond repair. So don't tell me about your fucking moral high horse.

Wow, you're turning my words in each and every way.
Yes, women were sexually assaulted. It's horrible. I didn't say ANYTHING good about it, but I did say there's more of that going on in the US every year without anyone flinching an eye. Here in Germany it's a tragedy.
I also said your president endorsed this kind of behavior.
Also, this entire discussion was your way of somehow showing Germany sucks, because there was this one event. I see no common sense there. Just a dude who has his mind set that immigrants are evil, period. The majority of "immigrants" are normal people. They have children, and lives just like you, and play Ps4 and go to work and have degrees. Your grandpa was probably an immigrant. 
The only difference is the skin color. 
In every group of a million people that moves around, there are going to also be criminals. There's no secret in that. Any kid can see its simple statistics. Turning this simple fact in a witch hunt against an entire race or religion? That's the kind of thinking that got you to be slave owners. You never just put all people of a certain heritage in one basket, unless you're following a political agenda. Because no two people are alike. 
But that would mean you have to treat each person individually. And sure, for you, westerners are individuals, but anyone else is just part of a big, homogenous group, I'm sure. Just deny it.

Absolutely with you on this. Everyone knows SOME block size increase will be necessary, regardless of segwit and LN. This isn't even a matter of debate, it's fact. So why not do it now, and win a few more valuable months until ANY viable alternative presents itself? Nobody was super hot for Segwit, the current adoption rate shows it too, we just went along because they promised Segwit2x. LN is great and all, but it's not here and adoption will take years. Until then, other coins will take the crown.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:57:37

Yes, you get higher fees, which will cover the cost of mining, which will at the same time go down sharply as miners leave and the difficulty decreases. The mining profitability will reach an equilibrium at a lower hardware cost and higher fees.

As a Romanian who hasn't stolen anything and scammed anyone, why do I have to take the blame for other people? Is it because it's too much of a hassle for you to differentiate between individuals, as long as they're not UK citizens? Well guess what buddy, individuals in other countries are as different and unique as you are.

The peak number of possible transactions moved up a bit thanks to segwit. We'll reach the new peak long before the next price bullrun. What happens then?
LN will not catch enough of the blow.
I'll make a prediction here, and that is, if BTC doesn't increase its block size during the next bull run (pursuing 100k), it will lose big parts of its market cap share.

But then again, your mentioning of the consensus was not really on point to my statement, either.

I'm sure that's some kind of fallacy as well.

I'm not sure what part of "in the future" you don't understand.
In 20 years from now, the scaling problem will have long been completely solved, leading to instantaneous and nearly free transactions of any size. The market capitalization will be so big that even the biggest players will have a hard time to move the market, so volatility will be strongly reduced. The market cycles, which have lasted weeks and months before, which right now last years, will then last decades. The crypto world will be an entirely different animal, as it already is now compared to 5 years ago, when transactions were cheap and the mentality was to spend as much as possible to get bitcoin into the mainstream.

Why are people so stubborn about the blocksize? Even with LN and Segwit live and adopted (which, who knows how long it will take until we get there), we will still eventually need to increase the blocksize, at least a few times. Why not do it now? 
Everyone agreed with this 2 years ago, before the discussion became a kind of ideological fight.

Not sure if 2020, but at one point in the future, every transaction Homer does will be committed on some underlying blockchain, whether he acknowledges this or not. Instantaneous, nearly-free global transactions are the norm, not the exception, and the added liquidity of the global market leads to a more agile, powerful economy. Homer might not notice this, either, however it will unknowingly improve his standard of living, especially if he lives in a developing country. There are probably no more mammoth banks, just lean institutions for insurances and services. With the banks' power diminished, a strong lobbying force will fall away, and with it its policy influence on governments. This, too, will probably improve Homer's life, without him really acknowledging it.
In an even better case, the blockchain technology will be used for a multitude of other scenarios, from communication between vehicles and smart devices to global data storage and distribution. Perhaps even a decentralised version of the internet. Depending on how ignorant Homer is, he might not notice any of the miraculous things that have changed around him in the world, and not realise his improved quality of life is a direct result of this. But if he's not the town's idiot, then it's improbable he would never come into contact with these technologies.
Then again, Homer doesn't sound like the kind of guy who would think much of the internet or understand how much the internet has changed the world, either.

Honestly, if BCH has block size increase AS WELL AS adopt segwit and LN after they have been properly tested, then why shouldn't I put all my money in BCH? All hate aside, it sounds like a winning strategy. If segwit fails, they have nothing to lose. If segwit succeeds, they have nothing to lose.
I was a fan of the Segwit 2x idea, so that would be almost the same thing. Even the Bitcoin developers know *some* blocksize increase will be necessary at some point.

There was no consensus, for any of the proposed solutions. Segwit has a 12% adoption rate at the moment, you call that consensus? Segwit was only tolerated because they had promised Segwit 2x, that's the only thing people could agree on. Now they've taken that away.

Bitcoin cash is a fork that has split off from the main Bitcoin blockchain this year. Its community says that the scaling problem which bitcoin was facing (and still is), leading to congested transaction backlogs and high transaction fees, can be solved by increasing the size of mined blocks, e.g. Increasing the number of transactions which are verified in one go. This was the subject of harsh debate for the past 2-3 years, since the other solution (which the main bitcoin chain now employs) is to use a mechanism called Segwit which reduces the size of transactions themselves, together with a second layer mechanism called Lighting Network (which is still in development) to reduce the number of transactions settled directly on the main blockchain. The Bitcoin Cash community says Segwit and lightning network will not work as expected. The Segwit community says that increasing the blocksize will lead to a more centralized infrastructure, since not everyone will afford to download and hold the entire blockchain in the future, as it grows exponentially.
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are like bickering brothers who love the same girl and forgot that Bros go before Hoes. Maybe one day both will co-exist in peace.

This is why the Genesis Nova hash needs to be verified by nodes the way a transaction would, before the pruning happens. Only a chain hash that has had a minimum number of confirmations (perhaps 50-100, just to be safe) can be used as the basis to switch to.

The same way they find consensus on the validity of transactions - by validating the specific blockchain hash a few times until it's part of the longest chain. Then cut the chain at your own will.

The same thing that happens if you try to make a transaction with higher input values than your address has to offer - it gets rejected by the network in the process of consensus finding. If the "people creating the algorithms" are a concern to you, then you're not talking about blockchain consensus.

I moved to Germany in 2001, the welfare state is amazing, we never worry about money, about unemployment, about health, the infrastructure is top of its game, and the economy is booming. We have a third the population of the US but greater exports and better quality goods, and better education. Also, we can afford to still treat immigrants like humans, unlike some other countries.
All that, and basic income might yet have at least three advantages over traditional welfare: 
1) reduce bureaucracy, thus more efficiently distributing the money - the state doesn't need to employ an army of people just for money distribution. 
2) reduce social stigma that comes with being unemployed. This will make it easier to find a job if you are unemployed, but also to maintain your social position.
3) Right now, the jump from unemployment benefits back to a salary brings only a small additional financial gain, thus more or less locking some people in unemployment. With basic income, every cent you earn additionally is an additional gain, thus motivating people to work.

Every time a rich dynasty is extinguished, their coin is lost forever. Value being thus removed from circulation, the demand for BTC temporarily outweighs the offer, and everyone's coin gains value in relation to other assets until a new equilibrium is found. This is only possible until a satoshi is worth too much to still assure high fungibility, one of Bitcoin's main advantages over gold.

Not an expert, but the way I see it
1. You can still use the underlying blockchain for direct transactions.
2. You can open direct channels to whomever you wish to transact with, circumventing any hubs that you deem unfit.
3. The more hubs there are, the harder it is to take it down.
4. Everyone can be a hub to everyone else. If everyone were to use it, then you might not even need any specialised hubs, since there are direct connections between all users. I've read an article describing how in social networks (like xing, linkedin, fb), you could find a connection from any person to any other person in about 4-5 steps.

Except I have. Block size increase is the scaling solution which the white paper proposes. This topic was considered a non-issue back in 2008, which could be addressed when the time came. This is because network and hardware capacities grow in time and they were thought to grow fast enough to accommodate the rate of block size increase. Sure, by now we know this isn't necessarily the case and the community is a few years smarter now, but you're not, your comment is just trash.

There are teams of hundreds of people invested in improving bitcoin and ethereum, both voluntarily, for their own gain, or as part of established and well financed business ventures that began their existence 4-5 years ago, while there are none working on your fork.
So unless you have a revolutionary idea like ethereum or iota, or an established market position and a huge team and permanent improvements like bitcoin, your fork is going to do shit all.

You seem very young. To clarify: there is a great inflation in Argentina, meaning their pesos are losing value annually, about 25%. So people are looking to exchange pesos for other, more 'stable' stuff, like gold, dollars, apartments, bitcoin. But since gold and dollar trades are made illegal by the government to avoid an even greater deterioration of the pesos value (the less it is used, the more worthless it gets), bitcoin seems like one of the better options.

This is the defintion from the white paper: 
"Bitcloud works on a variation of proof of stake known as proof of bandwidth. The nodes in this system are similar to the miners in the Bitcoin protocol in that they mine cloudcoins by providing bandwidth to the network. 
Instead of using a proof of work system where miners are looking for the solution to a complex mathematical equation, the nodes in Bitcloud are rewarded based on their share of the total amount of bandwidth used in the Bitcloud network. Each block reward is distributed among the nodes based on their share of the overall amount of bandwidth needed by the Bitcloud users."

I've had enough of religious zealots and "its either my side or the end of the world". I want to know what the changes to bitcoin mean, what they are and form an opinion based on that alone.

Sorry, but you don't sound very technically knowledgeable or at least your answer isn't.

Because that's not what I asked. 
And to your question, why this is important: Because I much rather trust that genius guy's vision than all the paranoid and hateful voices in r/btc and r/bitcoin, who, as you rightly pointed out, have turned to religious following rather than rational debate. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:53:33
Wow, so much hate. I tend to believe Gavin here, BU is closer to Satoshis vision and would be a better solution right now. Segwit can come later.

There need to be no fights. Put the code together, do both.

There will only be one true chain in the end, whichever that ends up being. And it's not going to be the one someone decides to call bitcoin, but the one which is, technically, the longest chain and thus bitcoin. That's how the blockchain works.

In the US 
@_date: 2017-03-23 06:44:59
Wow, after this answer I've realized there is a fundamental lack of understanding here. I've written my master's thesis on the way the blockchain works, and while you have half-knowledge going in the right direction, it's just that, half-knowledge. Yes, the proof of work is the thing that ultimately decides which chain will grow longer. But you couldn't just "build a long chain" that would get rejected, you still have to find the hashes, you still have to do the work, even before the network makes a decision to take your block in or not. Your statement shows little understanding. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 07:16:40
The imminent block size problem itself causes market price instability. 
Either way, I believe switching to classic would be a great political precedent that proves the ability of bitcoin to go another path than the normal one when necessary. It would make all future disputes much more easily to compromise for both sides. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:15:04
I don't even know who you are, I couldn't care less about you. And I didn't say pow is irrelevant, I don't know where and why you made that up. I said it's technically impossible to just "build a long chain", which is what you claimed, isn't it? If I misunderstood you then please clarify

@_date: 2017-03-31 08:45:52
Hm, I wanted to thank you for explaining this to me, but your last sentence lost all respect. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:15:59
It's too big for a screenshot, but this is what I got:
from sophroniabogdan sent 4 hours ago
I am sending you this message because the crypto community is too heavily censored, please read carefully.
The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).
One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.
So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.
The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.
If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1
Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.
Obviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.
Therefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).
First of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn't imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, "If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?", "If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?", "If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?".
Second of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.
Third of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.
So if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.

I don't think I understand your question. Your current bitcoins will continue to exist. Only transactions occurring during the fork might become undone until the longer chain wins the race definitively. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:31:56
Well, the thing is you can only broadcast single blocks to the network - they are (in most cases) added to the network one by one, unless two miners happen to have found a valid hash at about the same time, then a fork happens and both chains will live on for a little while, until one of the chains (the longer one, which proves it's also the one with the most hash power behind it) will attract all the hashing power (nobody wants to be stuck on a shorter chain). There is, however, no way to make a long chain and THEN somehow ask the network to accept or reject it. You do it one block at a time. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 08:22:01
This is the correct answer

It's enough to watch Erdogans speeches to see his personal ambitions extend way beyond just the well being of his county. His rhetoric is very nationalist, his attacks on some other countries unwarranted (especially the whole Holland/Germany fiasco, where he threw a fit and called Germany Nazis simply because he wasn't allowed to spread propaganda in a foreign country!). And now he wants a presidential system. I don't need to watch any news to make up my mind on the subject simply from his actions and words. He's blinding you and your children will revolt against him, but by then the damage will be done.

@_date: 2017-03-31 05:54:37
I understand how soft- and hardforks work, so let me put this differently: As far as I can tell, Segwit modifies the way the blocks are built, so legacy nodes will most probably not accept the blocks, leading to a hardfork. This is the argument I need to have debunked or confirmed.

You don't, either. In Bitcoin more than half the network capacity will flow into the same blockchain. As soon as that's true, almost everyone switches to that one implementation, else they lose money and spend time on blockchains that will never catch up.

Because that's the nature of exponential growth. Each bubble is exaggerated optimism, each crash is exaggerated pessimism, and the real value of the market is somewhere in between, visible only shortly between the boom bust cycles. The real value carries the long term direction of the price, but weekly/monthly movements are driven mostly by emotions and are a part of a big cycle which you can't explain with news and expert knowledge. This isn't the dollar or the euro. It's digital gold. And every so called gold expert shits himself when the price collapses, because he could never see it coming and can only explain it by patching up whatever information from the past he feels fits into his retoric. In other words, there are no experts who will know how the price will evolve. Neither in stocks nor in resources. Don't let anyone fool you. The S&amp;P will beat 99 percent of hedge funds in the long term - except a few lucky ones who think they're good - they're not. In a big crowd of people who place different bets, there are bound to be a few lucky ones.

Also, would have sold 2 months later
Also, as far as I know, bitcoin was not really attainable at &lt; $.01. The first real-life transaction taking place, long before there were any exchanges, was for two pizzas for 10000 bitcoins.  If we calculate the pizzas at a real value of together about 20$, then the first time bitcoin was traded in the real world was at $.2 . It still took months until people began regularly exchanging it for fiat money.

So your solution is to politically stop them from having a say? This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. If this were the way bitcoin worked, nobody would use bitcoin at all. Bitcoin is valuable BECAUSE it's resilient to politics and because everyone can democratically voice their opinion - in the end the solution which is best accepted by all - technologically - is the one that prevails. Not the one some guy, like you, decides is the right one. That's what makes bitcoin great.

You're still correlating bitcoin to the dollar. Try seeing the volatility of dollar vs gold to bitcoin vs gold. You'll notice bitcoin is less volatile than the dollar. You need to pick a different reference point than a fiat currency if you want your comparison to have any meaning.

It's important not to limit your search for meaning.

Most online communication is over ssl, which relies on traditional cryptography. When you write your password on your bank's website, it's ssl that makes sure nobody else can intercept and decypher it.
But ssl isn't impossible to hack, it's just not possible in a realistic timeframe, e.g. it would take thousands of years of computation, thanks to the fact that huge prime numbers are very hard to compute. However, the nature of quantum computers would make it feasible to compute them in a short period of time.

I agree with everything you said and one point makes me think: you consider the technical limitations (the block size bottleneck) in the last hype phase caused the price to crash. What happens if those same technical difficulties persist this time around, let's say next year, before we even cross the previous ATH? Will this pull all that hype value into alternative coins, making bitcoin lose its leading market position? I don't see lightning network managing to catch the blow, exchanges won't be able to switch fast enough. And a block size increase has become such a controversial issue that it might not reach consensus until its too late. How do you see this playing out?

This has little to do with the wallet. As long as you own the private key, you can change wallets whenever you want and still have access to all branches forked after the time of your initial coin ownership. 
The reason exchanges are not recommended is because they own the private keys, not you, so they decide if they allow you to extract the forked coins or not.

This is just one aspect. There's a lot in play regarding newly mined coins in relation to the amount of existing coins and their push onto the market that steers the price to different equilibrium levels with every halving, and the market psychology follows those price adjustments.

@_date: 2019-04-26 05:59:19
You can scale the blocksize a reasonable amount and still use 2nd layer for smaller transactions. LN isn't made for big transactions and two blockchain writes per lifetime is unrealistic, you're suggesting someone a) regulate and control how and when people write and b) that such a silly, impractical thing would dominate every other asset and coin. 
If this panned out the way you imagine, bitcoin wouldn't dominate, there would be many open competitors in the field. That's a more likely outcome anyway.
Also, banks didn't come into existence because gold was impractical. They came into existence because of the necessity and practicality of credits and investing money one doesn't yet own, for example to build a house. What good is it to save money 40 years and build a house when you're old, when you can build it now and live in it 40 years while you pay it back? You win on practicality, the bank wins on interest, everybody wins.

@_date: 2019-04-03 05:02:41
I wholeheartedly agree, it's just a matter of time before it becomes necessity. My feeling is it's being delayed as a method to force adoption of LN and Segwit, and avoid a slippery slope where blocksize increases become a regular solution to this issue. But I think there should be preparations for it, in case that adoption doesn't happen fast enough... Which might very well be the case, judging by past trends.

Is NFC already a thing? I don't want to scan a QR code anymore, I just want to hold my phone close to a POS.
Also (and I'm aware this is out of scope for a client, but would be a good idea for a company), automatically convert my btc to dollars or euros when the POS only accepts said currency, and also automatically transform fiat payments to my app account into bitcoin.
Also, the entire NFC thing could be used to automatically open channels with bitcoin-accepting POSs that I've visited more than twice. Like a bakery.
Bitcoin needs to become seamless, engrained into our everyday lives. And if this requires a temporary collaboration/entwine with the fiat system, then that's a small price to pay.

@_date: 2012-10-23 07:41:40
Honestly, all economics professors I had insisted that if the coin is gathering value as time passes, people are motivated to "wait" for a better time to spend. Which, at least personally, I can confirm, since it's what I am doing at the moment with bitcoins, and according to some analysis someone posted in here, so does more than 60% of the entire bitcoin network.
The inflation we experience with euros, for example, is artificially triggered (not talking about crisis effect here), to motivate investors and spending. Money loses value, so you'd better spend it. Makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2012-05-02 11:08:15
By "sells" you surely mean the demand for bitcoins? 
It's funny how people still fall for this, wanting to get in when something goes up and get out when it falls. If Warren Buffet proved anything, it's this: When stocks are falling hard, that's the perfect time to get in, as they have enough room to eventually grow back -simply put-. If you get in while they're very high, chances are that falling will be easier than growing any further.

I know this is frowned upon, but lightning really isn't made for huge payments. LN is there for smaller every day payments and micropayments. Everything big enough to tower over the incurred fees can be done directly via the blockchain. This way the transaction pool is never too congested, so fees will remain sane, but not everyone has to open an LN channel for everything.
The thing that is currently missing is rather a user friendly service that integrates these technical decisions into an app and abstracts them enough for the user not to have to think about them.

You don't have much imagination, my friend.
"A" pays 99 cents, "B" pays 1 dollar. They're playing for 1 dollar. So this is where it ends, right? "B" wins and "A" loses 99 cents.
"A" is smart, so he bids $1.01. "B" laughs at "A" and calls him stupid, he quits the bid, and thus "A" wins the bet. In the eyes of "B", they both lost. But now see this: Instead of losing 99 cents, "A" only lost 1 cent.

When we're talking about the more educated populace you're right, but the majority of people aren't college graduates or even people who consider their options with money.

If a big player (like Google or similar) were to catch on, then we'd be dealing with an explosion of "acceptance". Its use will be expanding far beyond the growth rate of the coins. This will cause a huge demand for a limited currency, automatically raising its value -a deflation- for a period of time, after which a bubble emerges, people buy like crazy because it keeps growing, until everyone realizes that's not the -real- value for it, then it will crash. And after a while, it will reach a state of equilibrium and stability.

@_date: 2011-09-19 22:00:56
But if what you said is true and hoarding has the effect of an "artificial inflation", then the hoarding itself becomes the incentive for people to spend, thus it's perfectly okay. As you probably know, most modern economies maintain an artificial inflation rate of about 2% for the purpose of "keeping money in circulation", as both private households and companies prefer spending to hoarding when fearing a decrease in value.

@_date: 2018-02-17 08:43:02
A blockchain is a transaction history. Usually you want to keep the entire history together, thus most coins rely on the longest chain of verified blocks in a blockchain as the ground truth. However, when miners happen to mine different blocks at similar moments in time, sometimes the blockchain splits for a while - having two different histories. The history that manages to unite the most calculation capacity will become longer faster and will eventually be accepted as the "true history".
Long story short, I can't think of a scenario where you want one coin with two chains. That would simply be two coins, like BTC and BCH.

Anyway, I don't really see how saving bitcoins leads to an inflation. The coins are not made by a central bank and their numbers don't increase simply because they're not circulating. That would be true for dollars, not for bitcoins. And even if that were true, gold is a viable currency, it always has been.
@_date: 2011-09-19 22:06:26
It's definitely a good strategy, and generally one that tends to scare regular investors off. But Warren Buffet used to buy increasingly more the further a stock dropped. Of course you can't just enter the market at any point, and considering the actual development you could argue if $5 is worth it. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:58:58
Or what? If the mining capacity goes to another fork because the miners want something else, then developer group  can say whatever they want. I don't understand the logic here. 
I mean sure, right now the current devs have the say because people trust them. But bitcoin was in the same position 2 years ago. 
@_date: 2011-09-18 13:29:07
Thanks for the insight. You're touching a really important point here. I myself have been thinking of bitcoins mostly as a long term investment, but it's also because that's what they are often advertised as. "Get more bitcoins through bonus programs!", "mine for more bitcoins!". Also, their planned saturation can only mean a long term increase in value as the offer eventually stagnates and the demand (possibly?) grows. 
For these reasons it can be difficult to ever avoid bubbles of eagerly-buying periods followed by the desperate-selling. Will people ever stop seeing it as an investment? Will they stop buying for the sole reason of making more money out of nothing? Right now this behavior is anchored so deeply in the capitalist mindset of our culture that it might never change.

@_date: 2017-05-26 17:23:56
You have it the other way around. The majority of uses of gold (besides uses in processors and other recent technology), like earrings, necklaces, bracelets etc have appeared BECAUSE gold was a good storage of value to begin with. Gold was a good storage of value because it had certain properties that few things in nature have. It's easily divisible, relatively easy to transport, it's in limited supply, it doesn't react chemically with other elements. These properties are what make it s viable medium of exchange, causing demand for it, which causes its value to rise. 
Bitcoin also fulfills those criteria, but better. It's much more easily transported - in a few minutes across the globe. You don't need huge vaults and an army to keep it safe from stealing. You don't need a middle man to make big payments. It's incredibly easy to split into very very tiny pieces. It has all the properties that make gold a great storage of value, and more.

Maybe your points are valid, but your interepretation of them is wrong. I own ether, but it would never cross my mind to want bitcoin to fail for the sake of ethereum, especially when bitcoin could, as you say, "make ethereum irrelevant". If that ever happens, it not like it's any effort at all to exchange my ether for bitcoins.

Actually, this is more recent wisdom I've acquired in the bitcoin crash of April 2013.  I told myself at around 17 dollars that the growth of the past few days had been too swift, and certainly unstable. So I decided not to enter the market. 
Then each day I maintained 'it will fall any day now'.
800% explosive growth later, I started regretting my decision.
Alas, it did fall after that, at the moment when everybody was certain it will go on forever. But it fell to 40, and never since then below it, certainly never again 17.

But since we're here now, your definition of "tech companies that create and maintain the worlds digital economy" shows you have little understanding of how bitcoin or any other decentralised currency works. The special thing about them is that they don't depend on any institution or central authority to function. The transactions are verified and stored in a decentralised manner all around the world, by millions of independent nodes. The only thing that could collectively bring down all digital currencies would be if the internet ceased to exist. But if that happened, we'd have much greater problems to deal with than to worry about money and gold.

Point me to any year in the past of the world in which you were more free to just leave your job without starving to death, or leave your whole life behind and move into the woods if you wish to? What freedom do you speak of? Because the freedom I know has never before been so embracing. In the past, the freedoms you now enjoy and take for granted were reserved to a very small aristocracy. Most people had to work day in day out to have enough food to survive and for their children to survive. These days, in most western societies, even jobless and homeless people need not fear death. Death was a very tangible, every day occurence in the past. How many dead people did you see on your street this week? On what do you base these  statements? Your entitled little view of the world?

The fact that the taxes are obligatory makes them sound gruesome, that's true. But it is fact that people would not always pay for services they profit from on their own. You use water, electricity and roads. That is all infrastructure that is maintained by taxes. But someone not living by a main road would see little reason to pay for it, even though he indirectly profits from it (economy blooming, etc). You enjoy the protection of firefighters, police and hospitals. Privatizing these services has horrendous effects on individuals without enough money, yet nobody thinks about that. Healthy people don't have an immediate incentive to pay health insurance, but society prospers greatly through it, especially individuals who otherwise might not afford it. Instead of individuals getting broke, everybody pays a small sum to dampen that impact. Economy is full of situations in which everybody prospers through cooperation, even though for the individual it seems counter productive. As I said, read about game theory.

The voting comitees in each town and city could generate a new address for each person voting and then allocate it a very small amount (1 mBTC or less). It's a similar process to handing you a blank piece of paper. 
A machine then allows you to 'spend' that amount on addresses associated to the candidates (for ease of use, by simply clicking on their name, similar to present systems. The voter doesn't necessarily have to understand the workings of bitcoin)

In the money business, trust is everything. Bitcoin is the longest living crypto, and will always be, so it garners more trust in it's unhackability, if you will. Every passing day, it proves continually it's robust, and becomes more trustworthy. Most people don't understand why gold has value, they try to pin it on practical uses in microchips and similar silly applications, many of which didn't even exist a short while ago. Gold is valuable because in its thousands of years used as store of value and sometimes medium of exchange, it could never be forged or reconstructed chemically - though many have tried throughout history. That was a big part of alchemy. 
Because of its longevity and first mover advantage, bitcoin also has the biggest developer communities, the most planned out projects for improvement, and of course the strongest brand recognition, even for laymen. 
Not to mention it still often represents the only trading pair that can be used to buy or sell more exotic coins on crypto exchanges and is the only coin which institutions seem to be genuinely interested in investing in, probably because of said brand recognition and trust.

Not quite. A so-called "bubble" is an exageration of demand, usually through speculation, causing an overvaluation of the currency.

Your chart clearly shows the pricing of homes spiking up between 2000 and 2008 without the effect of inflation being considered. That's proof that the housing bubble had other causes than inflation, as I stated above.
And here are some charts of the average income and the average price of houses (not adjusted for inflation). In both cases, the absolute numbers have risen approx. 4-fold since 1980. 
[U.S. Average Annual Wage &amp; Salary Income of Employed Persons](
[U.S. Average Price of Houses](
@_date: 2013-07-03 06:57:17
In your example the price of the housing has risen while the salary has not. Those are two different events that have little to do with inflation.
 They depend more on the number of people alive . If more skilled people exist, their skill is worth less and they need more houses, thus making those now expensive. As far as I can tell, salaries and housing would evolve the other way around if the world population wouldn't grow at this insane rate, with or without inflation. 
Also, in reality salaries and prices try to keep pace with inflation. That's why you make more money than your parents in absolute terms. Usually the consuming power is pretty stable. The housing bubbles are a whole other, unrelated problem.

Bitcoin can't be fully considered a measure of value in its current stage.

Well, in our nearly post-famine and post-suffering western countries, it's easy to say this. But in times and countries where food is scarce, work is hard and life is rough, people try to escape the awful reality. For some, religion is a way to cope with hard times and is the only glimpse of hope they can hold on to. 
I know this, because, even though I myself am not religious, I have grown up in a religious environment.

Thanks for the charts, that's a very interesting perspective on things. However. Considering that both the demand for oil and gold has risen faster than the supply during that timeframe, a certain correlation could be expected. If you compare the value of gold to, say, bread and butter, things don't look so rosy. 
[Here]( you can see that the price of bread in gold has fallen sharply from 1997 to 2010, from 300 loafs per ounce of gold to 388 loafs per ounce of gold. But you might be right, since it seems the price has stayed more or less between these limits for a very long time, while the bread-to-dollar ratio has varied much more intensely. 
If someone is able to find more data regarding the stability of gold's purchasing power, I'd be very grateful to see it, since I could use it in a thesis.

I don't want to spoil your party, but in its present form, bitcoin is not as democratic as you think. Right now, this is the hashrate distribution: 
What this means is, there are 8 companies out there (be it mining pools or self-mining companies) who have more than 75% of the voting rights. It's enough that the biggest 3 of these companies decide to accept new rules, and new rules will be applied.
You may say the mining pools are tightly tied to their user base, since going against the user's interest would make them switch to another pool. But even so, if all Mining Pools were to agree on new rules at the same time, then the changes would pass nonetheless, because any attempt to start new mining pools would come too late to reverse without splitting the blockchain in two. Also, companies like ASICMiner don't have that problem at all, they can accept whatever transactions they want.

When you mine, you add a special generation transaction of 25 BTC to the block. This is how new Bitcoins are created. This transactions doesn't have inputs, but you could theoretically modify the client in such a way that you can define multiple outputs to it, not much different than on any other transaction.
If I were you, I would get in touch with a developer that knows his way with the client you use for mining and ask him about this. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 17:04:20
Okay, I am starting to understand what you're aiming at. But you have one flaw. You are underestimating the primal nature of the human being. In your world view, people want to be all equal, but that's just not how people are.
There is a reason why rich people strive to gain even more, seemingly limitless wealth. There is a reason why girls don't like to wear the same dress at a dance. There is a reason why we play football, and basketball, and tennis. There is a reason why guys like fast, expensive cars more than other cars that would achieve the same purpose, or why they like skinny women now although they used to like curvy women 2000 years ago. 
And last but not least, there is a reason why capitalism and no other form of society has allowed humans to achieve such growth. 
That reason is simple. It's competitiveness. It is in our genes, as one of the prime instincts that has allowed us, as a species, to survive and thrive for millions of years.
No matter how much someone has, he is only then satisfied when he has more than the people around him. You don't need a lot of money to be happy, as long as everybody around you has less. 
And that is why any utopian civilization will fail. Sure, it will last one generation, if you're lucky, two. But someday, someone will feel special, and entitled to more than everybody else, and won't see a reason to give up what is his for those who have lost what is theirs. Because we like to strive for greatness. We almost never consider we achieved it, though. That's the reason it's called "a pursuit for happiness".

There is no country in which Bitcoin itself is illegal. That's as if banning stones or cigarretes if people started using them in exchange for other things. 
If I give you a pizza, you can pay me in apples instead of dollars if I willingly accept it. Who is going to stop that? In Bitcoin, all I do is write down "I have two apples less, you have two apples more" and then encrypt it and verify it to make sure nobody can change that writing, so that we both know who has how many apples. Who is going to stop that? On which basis? Because you can exchange it for illegal things? I could exchange apples for marijuana.
Bitcoin isn't something to deem illegal. Its use can be illegal, but it doesn't have to be.

Your answers lack arguments. Also, gold prices [haven't been at all stable]( over the past 50 years. Of course, this is the gold/USD ratio, but the rate of gold to other currencies has hardly behaved any differently. 
Yes, gold has a nearly fixed supply, but the demand is highly influenced by speculations, investments and emotions. Or perhaps our definitions of stability differ.

@_date: 2013-06-28 16:47:52
That depends on your priorities. For example, from a juridical point of view, having bitcoins at an exchange means you have a claim against that exchange and money that goes missing can be demanded back by law. If you have the bitcoins in your wallet, at least in Germany, it's considered just a transaction in a database and has no juridical safefail. Bitcoins stolen from a wallet can't even be sued for.
Also, you can't completely 'move away from exchanges'. You will need them to enter and exit the market. Not everybody is going to mine coins. I know I don't.

Not only and not all libertarians are reasonable. I don't see myself as belonging to any camp, but I'll tell you why I like bitcoin. I like it for its internationality, I will be able to go to any country and pay with my phone in a currency I know. I like it for its low fees, I can transfer money to my relatives in another country or buy things online without paying PayPal and western union. I like it for its speed. A transaction takes minutes and hours instead of days. I like it because it's safe, I like it because it will be stable, I like it because it will offer people in need an alternative and an escape from hyperinflation. I like it for so many reasons. But illegal use is not one of them. Revolutionary propaganda will be the reason why it will be looked down upon by those who could do the most good with it. Take a more moderate stance. Look at it from more perspectives than rebellion. Bitcoin is a wonderful idea, don't waste it.

This is the problem. Money doesn't flow as seamlessly. However, if an investment promises higher returns than deflation, people will still invest, though decision will be more diligently made.

Also, things like the real estate bubble would be a thing of the past, since people will think twice about giving out money without enough security /backup.

I liked the idea of having "contracts" for the things that the government owes you for your tax-money. That's a really interesting thought.
However, your talk about a society in which everybody is 'free to do as they wish', where obviously anybody with the slightest amount of power could easily gather even more power, leading to a dictatorial system, is just foolish. What's to stop the strongest guy on the block bashing the other guys' head in if he feels like it? Why should his freedom be allowed to destroy the freedom of others?
I think only someone who was born and raised in very good conditions can come to consider such an option as attractive, simply because he/she doesn't really grasp what it means. Where I was raised, we had those kinds of people running around, and I tell you, the broken democracies are heaven compared to that. 
If you honestly want that kind of anarchy (which I'm almost certain you don't), simply move to some of the poorer African nations, your dreams will be fulfilled.
But honestly, just compare the prosperity of nations, and you'll truly objectively see which systems have worked out best until now. Where is the "objectively provable" fact that you were talking about?

@_date: 2013-06-18 23:29:01
I'll presume by "code" you mean the bitcoin address?
1. Well, first off, you don't send the funds to the seller, you send them to the escrow service. That is usually a trustworthy person or company that has a reputation of securing the payment. The escrow service gives you a bitcoin address to send the payment to.
2. If your question is from a technological perspective, as in "how can you be sure the address has never been generated before?", well, there are *so* incredibly many random addresses that can be generated, that the risk of collision (i.e. the same address being generated twice) is neglijable. 
 There are exactly 2^160 possible addresses. 2^160 is 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976.
That's more bitcoin addresses than there are stars in the observable universe. So no worries there.
3. If you mean "unused" as in "that seller has never used it before", that doesn't matter. You can use the same address as often as you want to receive payments, there is no restriction.

The demand is so much higher than the supply, I have a feeling that this run-up won't hold up much longer. It seems too artificial, too 'excited' to really give us a realistic value of the coin at this moment. I just exited the market completely, waiting for it to fall soon.

OP, you make a couple of valid claims, but have absolutely no evidence or backup for the numbers. 
Also, you're thinking in the narrow sense when talking about businesses making users part with their coins. That's not the only viable business model. For example, just think of a model of payment in 'fiat' that uses bitcoins in the background for international money movements. And you already have a viable model that makes bitcoin incredibly useful without depending on early adopters consuming like wild. 
It was always to be expected that early adopters will have a high incentive to hold on to the coins, and I think this will continue until the price reaches a new, long-term stable level. At that point, the incentive to hold the coins will be lower, since nothing spectacular is happening. But for now, volatility is still a problem. Not businesses.

That's right. If we speak of technicalities, this is all true and bitcoin offers all the best possibilities, if you have the knowledge. But fact is, at the moment it's not something a person without any kind of technological or specific bitcoin knowledge would be able to do. It's a hassle. My parents and their parents wouldn't touch it, and that's what this is about. We won't see mass adoption until someone offers those people services on top of bitcoin that take away the burden of security and scam-prevention.

Good read, although a bit overly optimistic to say "bitcoin will become the world reserve currency".

This post is a joke. Nobody acting individually rational 'favors' taxation if the legal alternative would be no taxation. But one might indeed see the advantages it can have in general for the economy and not oppose taxation in certain circumstances. Also, what taxation are we talking about here? Income tax? VAT? Investment tax?
Also, no, this is by no means a good way to hold such a poll. You're in for God's sake. 
Even if the two abovementioned points were irrelevant, which they are not, you don't do a poll trying to find out the preference of someone by simple asking them straight on what their preference is. If I ask you 'do you prefer blue or red?' your answer has no meaning. To find your real preference I would have to have a thought-out survey making sure it eliminates any bias concerning your present actions, surroundings and feelings. Just asking "do you like it that the big bad state takes money away from you?" has only one possible answer. This is your question to the extreme, but you get my point.

You need a copy of the blockchain only if you are mining. Not everybody needs to own one. Most late-adopters won't even bother with mining for bitcoins, especially not the grandma you mentioned. 
Also, the people who do want to mine aren't forced to download the entire blockchain, they can use a blockchain copy from a server that's shared between multiple nodes, as long as they trust the server. 
Last but not least, there's the possibility of pruning the blockchain (as was already mentioned in a comment)

I grasp what you are saying. That the bitcoin economy would allow loans and prices to fall and grow as demand and supply sees fit. If the value of the coin grows, salaries can keep falling in a predictable fashion without as much as being felt as a nuisance , almost in the way that salaries grow nowadays. However, you are wrong insofar as saying the currency is not deflationary. By definition it is, since the number of Satoshis is limited, however way you look at it. 
@_date: 2013-09-08 16:50:00
That already exists. That's how paper wallets and coins work. You hand over the private key. 
The thing to consider here is that the other person must trust you to not own another copy of the private key, or else you could still use the money yourself. That's why this usually only works with paper wallets from companies everyone trusts (for example casascius coins) instead of ones issued by yourself.

Okay, I guess I'll be 'that guy'.
Many will come screaming in a second, but here's what I think: If the Winklevoss' plan goes through, and Bitcoin somehow manages to be implemented as a financial instrument or part of other financial instruments (especially by big players) and if it allows the possibility to short, then not only will bitcoin achieve enormous word-of-mouth popularity and rising prices, but it will also begin to stabilize.
If Bitcoin remains the way it is now, a toy for dreamers and a tool for illicit activity, then it will continue on its way, as it has until now. 
What I don't see, however, is a scenario where everyone suddenly loses both the faith, interest and the utility of Bitcoin and the value drops to $0. I think inconceivably harsh times would have to come for that to happen.

People buy bitcoin for the same reasons people have bought gold for thousands of years. And in case you are thinking "but people buy gold to make bracelets and such", then you are only half correct. The bracelets themselves would be worthless, would gold not symbolize wealth, stability and security. 
This is where bitcoin comes in. It offers guaranteed long-term security. As long as the bitcoin protocol is not breached through cryptography, bitcoin will just 'be'. What this means is, if you have some money in bitcoin, this money will prevail through inflation and financial crisis. 
This is the case, because bitcoin is durable, divisible, liquid (longterm as the market cap increases), impossible to counterfeit, rare (only 21 million will exist), won’t rust, decay or burn, is convenient, fungible and anonymous. Yes, these are also the attributes of gold, and at the same time the longed-for attributes of any naturally occuring money in a society. 
And as if this wasn't already enough, above gold, bitcoin is also much easier to transport and transfer internationally, doesn't need vaults and huge sums of money invested in security measures for safe-keeping or in infrastructure (banks) and cannot be manipulated by any government or single entity. Also, it enables technology to integrate money in itself (take, for example, the bitcoin tips that are going around on Reddit). 
All of these aren't just little games some techies are playing. In my opinion, bitcoin is "gold 2.0" for as long as the mathematical premises on which it stands hold.
If you wish to read more about it, you can ask me questions regarding bitcoin [here]( or [here]( I wrote my master thesis on the suitability of bitcoin as money.

Interesting, this behavioral pattern seems to be very typical for humans. I know many people who said exactly this after the bitcoin price fell in April, me included. "I bought them cheap, sold too early and regreted, then I bought in again and I'm in it for the long run". I wonder, if this behavior is so predictable, isn't this the losing strategy? Whoever is in the business for a long time can use it to profit.

Sorry, I have to reply to your comment once more, because your statement makes me curious. Is this true? Do you have any sources confirming this? I don't know the bitcoin source code, so I couldn't tell, but unlimited divisibility would be very interesting indeed. 
**Edit:** I found [this]( discussion. Very interesting. Thanks.

Their latest dividents were lower than they used to be, so some people who were in for the short term decided it's a good time to sell. Especially since there is some heavy competition closing in on the market.
But if you want to hear my two cents, dividends of over 20% per year are amazing, whichever way you see it.

Thank you, however, the question was not how to avoid having to change the block generation time, but *why* it shouldn't be changed.

That's a grim outlook, what makes you think the world is developing in that direction? Except for the bank and credit issues, I think the fact that the population in rich countries is stagnating, that medicine and education are coming along nicely in the entire world, that countries which were deemed 3rd world 20 years ago are in a bright economic position and that the use of renewable energies is becoming more and more adopted shows an entirely different, positive outlook on the future. 
But to consider the deflation problem: The way I see it, bitcoin will not become the sole currency of the world, but it will be, like gold and for a multitude of reasons better than gold, an enhancement of the financial world we have today. People will use it as a commodity to keep their saving safe without fearing inflation, or to make big, safe international transactions at low cost. Loans and credits will still exist, or in case they shall someday be feared because of negative consequences which might or might not appear as a result thereof, that fear will pass, as human nature has it, and they will reappear at a later time to be cherished as a solution to all problems. But this will happen outside the bitcoin network. As far as the bitcoin network is concerned, high frequency trading will take advantage of arbitrage possibilities and small price changes, so that after the limit number of bitcoins is reached and a high enough number of people use it -high enough is arbitrary and can mean anything, but I reckon it refers to the the technology literate population and a wild assumption is that they might correlate somewhat with the number of facebook users-, they will help maintain stability.

I know I'm late to the party, but I think he sees it as 'natural' since everything in nature degenerates in time. We get old, stuff breaks, etc. So it's only normal that the 'value' that something has now will shrink as times goes on, anything else would just describe the nature of a virus.
Which leads to an interesting observation: By having a currency that loses value over time, we humans need to keep up growth, productiveness and profitability to make up for that loss. So in a way, the incentives force us to waste resources and to 'break the planet'.

I understand your point and I don't need to know the reasons, but know this: If bitcoin is to become widely adopted, it will be through regulation. You can't get paid in a currency in which the employer cannot pay taxes. 
Also, before portraying all taxes as wicked, take a short moment to think of all the good things we profit from thanks to collective participation. We would not be enjoying this standard of living were it not for the infrastructure we build and maintain through taxes. Taxes don't just pay politicians, you know. I'm not trying to persuade you, I just hope you see both sides of the coin.

You're absolutely right, and I have no doubt in the long-term profitability and growth of bitcoin. But I never trust spontaneous outbursts of value of these magnitudes. I'll hop in as soon as I feel it's stabilizing again. Right now, whoever owns a big bunch of bitcoins and feels now is the perfect time to liquidize could bring it down easily.

Nothing is a currency just because someone said so. Almost nobody is trading xrp right now, so it's not a currency. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 17:07:56
That money has to come from somewhere. And there are many use-cases for which bitcoin is more appropriate than other currencies. That's why people will use it. I don't care much about short term volatility, in the long run, we're good.

 Here's a "summary" of the Report's results: 
-Among other facets, we believe Bitcoin and its associated technology represent a potentially game-changing disruption to our covered payments companies.
-We see the intrinsic value of Bitcoin as the conduit in a new global crowd-funded open-source payment network.
-We observe three key sources of demand for Bitcoin - as a disruptive payment network technology, an alternative uncorrelated asset class, and a safe haven currency, but believe the payment network capabilities are the key to the sustainability of crypto currency, with Bitcoin the early leader.
-We believe that by decentralizing processing, allowing for market-based fees and adding new functionality, crypto currency technology provides a powerful alternative to branded networks. Initial benefits for crypto currency technology may be in processing micro transactions and cross-border payments, but the potential for innovation is significant.
-We believe the key to Bitcoin’s success so far, and significant promise going forward, is in crowd-funding the development of the first new global payment network in decades. By allowing infrastructure providers to get compensated in the conduit/currency (Bitcoin) and then adding more investors by selling them the conduit/currency, the payment network is being capitalized by a very broad set of infrastructure providers and investors.
-We see some evidence for this in the willingness of key countries (Germany, USA, China) to regulate, not shut down Bitcoin, in spite of the perceived risk to their sovereign currency.
-We do believe there is a meaningful probability Bitcoin (the specific currency/conduit) may not succeed, but this will most likely be a result of the emergence of a better crypto currency.
-Based on the order of magnitude of the overall opportunity and some very rough calculations we also believe scenarios exist by which a Bitcoin could be worth 10-100x its current price.
-We believe the volatility in Bitcoin prices is a result of an -extended price discovery process as the market overcomes substantial friction and the very divergent set of outcomes. [...] Therefore, we do not expect volatility to subside anytime soon.
-The long-term threat posed by this technology is mostly to the payment networks (V, MA) and technology facilitators such as ACIW, in our opinion.
-We see the long-term opportunities presenting themselves to payment-type-agnostic technology providers such as EBAY.

If the stock is underpriced and with high long term potential, then you should buy. That's what Warren Buffer teaches you. However, the real value of bitcoin is, as of now, still a thing of faith more than it is of facts.
