It's not a bad idea to have an open discussion with the moderators.  It would be nice to know if the attitudes expressed by Starmaged [in this thread]( are representative of the general moderation philosophy in this subreddit.  It would also be nice if rule changes (like the downvote posting delay) were mentioned in the sidebar. In the end, it's the mods' sub to do with how they wish. I share gonzobon's reservations regarding the motives/activities of certain mods, but I'd also extend those reservations to include many of the "big names" associated with Bitcoin.

Did you even read the pdf?  The judge had 4 choices:  corporate reorganization, civil rehabilitation, bankruptcy, and special liquidation.  They chose the 3rd option.

The pics are not of anyone I know, and they're shared with my "friends" but not public.  Here's something else to wonder about:  [this]( exists, as do many others like it. The reason a free-to-register, selfie-based website would not allow pornography (or be very strict about nudity itself) is pretty obvious:  the format makes it impossible to prevent children from becoming members.  One can argue about which culture is correct when it comes to young people and sexuality; one cannot argue Facebook would not be in violation of most national laws if they were found to be knowingly storing pictures of nude children on their servers.

I understand some people here don't like to call bad news what it is, but the second richest nation in our "crappy world economy" is currently not willing to play nice with Bitcoin.  China's projected economic growth is more than twice that of the U.S. over the next two years and they hold 19% of the world's population.  For any enterprise that relies on voluntary global adoption, that is bad news.  It doesn't mean the end is near or the sky is falling or whatever.

Okay.  There are 4 types of insolvency laws in Japan.  Bankruptcy (the judgement rendered in that pdf) is one of them.  [This]( explains Japanese *bankruptcy* procedure.

@_date: 2014-04-14 04:58:08
I'm more concerned with the conference.  If industry leaders are actually publicly advocating illegal behavior (dunno if true, just read the different summaries on this sub) then every major retailer was given another reason not to accept bitcoin.

You should.  Lean heavily on the inevitable replacement of the dollar in your discussion and he'll probably be convinced.

@_date: 2014-04-15 06:41:28
No need to be sorry.  Actually, I owe you an apology. Those numbers from banktracker are correct (per the individual bank websites), but those fees aren't really "hidden" anymore.  I'm shocked, actually, 'cause I haven't paid any maintenance fees (other than overdraft fees...we were all young once) in the last 15 years or so.  What's weird is all of those banks have other options, complete with fewer requirements or no fees, but those are the most popular.  Apparently the banks are as crooked as we all thought, but most of us aren't terribly good at researching our accounts either.

This type of bankruptcy?  Bankruptcy in this case is a judgement rendered concerning the insolvency of the company.

Tell me, Bob.  Would you really, truly like to hear about my "great experience"?  I'd like to share it with you but am worried you wouldn't believe it.

Good point, catwelder.  You are truly the moral compass of this sub.
@_date: 2014-04-19 22:20:01
Would you like a link explaining the debacle, including the parties actually involved, or would you prefer to continue to believe your post with "over 2000 upvotes" was the gamechanger in a sub with five million subscribers?

"Collectivism" was the fatal flaw of nazism?  Jesus Christ.

Was actually just wondering if a business had ever done this.  I can't see any business (in the US, that is) adopting this payroll method regardless of the employee demand, simply because there are so many benefits to holding that cash for large companies and such tight margins to even make payroll for small companies.  As mentioned, this could certainly be done now...

I don't even... I understand you don't care for the Fed and would disagree with almost anything their representative said, but your linked article has some issues.  The chart you're using is somewhat misleading, as explained by Matt Busigin (and others) [here]( and elsewhere.   Also, Jefferson, Lincoln, and J.P. Morgan most certainly did not pay the same for a loaf of bread. We know they didn't because [people keep records of what things cost] ( Anyway, I enjoyed the post and appreciate you supporting and defending Bitcoin.

Nope.  And yes, that makes no sense at all and hasn't for 30 years.  When the first articles about the EFI switch were posted in 2011 I was flabbergasted, especially since by then, the only mechanics I knew who knew how to do carb work either grew up with them or did restoration or rat-rod work.  I understand wanting to limit the power in that motorsport, but their indifference to the safety concerns inherent in steering limitations is truly mystifying.

Got it.  The discussion moved from debit to credit transactions and I didn't notice.

True.  My favorite was the starmage one informing us he was okay with letting a known scammer advertise on a post and scam us, but wasn't okay with any of us drifting off topic in the same thread.

Bitcoin's mining problem is probably the least of its concerns if its base is filled with sock puppets with racist slurs in their username.

Wow.  This is what happens when you turn a subreddit over to someone who's been a redditor 6 whole days.  Wish I could laugh.

His numbers were off.  Most all studies I've seen only use adults as well, but they all say at least 2.2 billion have bank accounts.  World Bank and Mckinsey have better info.  McKinsey's data is [here]( if you want to look at the pdf.

I agree the advertisement for services utilizing Bitcoin has been rather unimpressive to say the least.  However, comparing this protocol to film and video technology or telephony would not result in a terribly flattering view of Bitcoin.  While patent holders certainly advertised both television and telephone technology, the adoption was mostly driven by the promise of an experience that was previously impossible.  Before telephones there was no voice communication over distance; likewise, before film technology there was no way to witness an event (real or imagined) without attending it.  Bitcoin certainly offers  alternatives to financial experiences we already have, but so far very few useful unique experiences have been implemented.

The only ones hurt by that claim are him and anyone who'd believe someone who'd make a 12 minute video and not do an iota of research.  The nazi party wasn't a group of "good people" who did "bad things" (whatever the hell that means); the party was founded by people who actively intended to do bad things to jews and any other group not lucky enough to reside in the nazi's racial hierarchy.  No one has to invent reasons to hate government; those reasons are already there.

Btcpyramid noticed this weirdness 16 days ago.  [Same address, same binary results](  If it's starting to affect transaction times this is very worrisome indeed.

I don't know how it applies to bitcoin, but you've got the buyer-seller thing reversed.  In crashes, there is no shortage of sellers (at any price); instead there are simply no buyers.  If I think my 4 beanie babies are worth $16,000, yet no one is willing to buy them for $4, how much are they actually worth (factoring in my love of plush toys, of course)?

If you want the price of bitcoin to go up, China may or may not matter.  I can't be the only one who's given up  attempting to explain bitcoin's dollar value.  However, if you want bitcoin to actually be a global currency, has that answer.

I'm not assuming anything. He asks, "What is so bad about Nazis?".  Good news, I just covered that.  
Just before 3:00 "It wasn't that the people said, 'All right! All you evil people: put me into power,' It was they tricked good people into putting them into power."  Racial hierarchy was the cornerstone of the Nazi party platform.  They didn't hide any of that.  Regardless of what you think of collectivism or any -ism, he made that entire scenario up.

Regarding OP's direct deposit ideas:  has anyone ever even heard of a job that does this?  Even day laborers working off the books typically wait until the end of the day to get paid.  What benefit to the employers could this arrangement possibly have?

First you suggested your post was connected to decision to change their filtering, and then you claimed "I don't know if my post would've affected the outcome or not."  Why don't you take a few minutes to read [the summary]( and let me know when your name comes up.

It really depends on how the Chinese government decides to approach it.  If they harden their stance, maybe even make it illegal to own let's say, it would be dreadful.  A country with that much invested in internet censorship and monitoring might easily track bitcoin mining and jail the miners.
