I am not, I just really do not understand why people buy these kind of cars once their financial status improves... 
I have money, I do and consume what I want and climate change is not my problem.

Great  to read: no bullshit consumerism. This makes me believe you are a smart person trying to upgrade your life through crypto without creating externalities that others (people, environment,...) will have to pay for. Your strategy seems good -&gt; keep some to be safe in crypto and sell some to be safe in fiat. Only question is of course which dollar value will btc reach during this bull run...

It would really help me out if you would take 4 minutes to fill in this survey. Everyone wants to read about interesting research results, but I notice almost no one wants to contribute to my attempt to collect interesting information right from the heart of the blockchain community. Common guys and girls, just donate a little bit of your knowledge and time to the research of an enthusiastic master student!

Blockchain could open up several possibilities like implementing tariff structures combined with smart water meters to incentivize water usage. Blockchain could be used to audit water quality data immediately. It could be used for a decentralised autonomous treatment plant,... etcetc
There doesn't have to be something wrong to make something better...

If people from within certain industries won't look at what benefits new technologies can offer them... well I think a lot of innovative technologies will end up without useful use cases. I see lots of use cases for drinking water companies: smart metering +  smart contracts to imply tariff structures (especially useful for regions impacted by prolonged periods of drought), a shared ledger to register and audit water quality measurements, in the future decentralised autonomous treatment plants as a DAO. ICOs as a way to find local investors for e.g. treatment plants and give them a way to vote for or against optimization investments,...
