an iphone app where I can see on a map users around me that I can buy/sell bitcoin with. I believe this would be most helpful app, imagine being at the airport and finding someone with local currency, then giving them Bitcoin. All done with mobile phones. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:42:10
I'm not an expert, it's just an idea that I think would make things so much more easier for the average joe.

@_date: 2015-12-03 02:28:04
Bobby wow, it's a pleasure a talk with you. I live in Colombia, South America. How did you get started in creating a Bitcoin exchange? What knowledge is needed to start a Bitcoin exchange, is it hard?
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:08:44
much simpler would be to buy DASH and then mix them in the wallet with one button, simple and faster then your simple guide

the gold market is rigged by the global elite. No point in buying gold, the elite have TONS OF REAL GOLD locked up underground that nobody knows about. They own most of the mines and so they are like OPEC controlling the price of Gold. China and Russia buying isn't going to do much damage. Who owns the mines? The elite.

Where do I sign up as a security officer? I want to have full access to the supercomputer, you know make sure no one is tampering with it :)
@_date: 2015-06-21 16:00:46
Well, gold is mined, no limit. We can only estimate how much is mined every year from legal mines. We have no idea how much is coming out of the ground from illegal mines. I used to own gold, but Bitcoin is better, limited supply. Gold is not limited. No one actually knows how much is out there.

MEGA, Gmail, Yahoo, or any email provider should consider investing in creating a secure lightweight bitcoin wallet inside of their email client.

With a credit card you are giving people at the bank your money, with Bitcoin it's yours, you can put it wherever you want, you don't have limits on how much to spend, no Bank Holidays, it's new tech like the internet in 1995.

Cheers to the Noobs!!!! The crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. But the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:13:51
He's wrong, because if you divide 6 months by the total number of Bitcoin wallets and then multiply that number by the number of people not using Bitcoin and then add +1, flip over the number 6, you get a price of $6,000 Bitcoin :)

Dress up you like a Japanese man, put on sunglasses with 2 QR codes on each lens, wear a soccer shirt with Nakamoto printed on the back and walk down Rodeo Drive with a stunning Asian girl to your rented Ferrari.

BitsharesX (BTSX) is the future, you have shares that earn interest, you can hold BitAssets - such as BitUSD or BitGOLD, it's Bitcoin on Steroids - just look at coinmarketcap, BitsharesX is exploding in value, download the wallet and see for yourself, oh and Overstock said that you'll be able to purchase Overstock shares with BTSX in the near future :)

@_date: 2014-07-05 15:10:04

@_date: 2014-09-23 21:35:03
yep because it means the Bitcoin logo will be displayed to more people, and since it's cheaper than other payment methods, more people will decide to buy into Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:43:27
BTSX fixes all of Bitcoin's problems. And BitGLD just opened today on BTSX, which by the way is an exchange, you pay for shares in a decentralized exchange.

People you all are falling for the trap, these coders are working for the US government. It's so obvious just look at their logo, an all seeing eye and upside down pyramid. Even their youtube video you can obviously tell they are all young agents that just want money. I guarantee there is a backdoor in their software somewhere. Look at their youtube channel name: Defense Distributed. Their whole agenda is right out in the open.
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:31:18

where do you spend most of your online money? I spend it on Amazon.com and ebay.com, we need to talk to the vendors in those places to sell on a Bitcoin Marketplace with no fees. That way they win and we win.
@_date: 2015-05-18 00:35:41
what is the market? people with money

I predict Bitocoin will be over $1000 by the end of this year, there is no question that the ball is rolling faster down the hill, October we should see 2 or 3 more big companies accepting Bitcoin, November 4 to 6, and December 8 to 12 right in time for Christmas.

The exchange is on everyone's wallet, download the Bitshares wallet and take a look at the Market section. Bear in mind it takes a while to download the blockchain and that it's still in it's early stages like Bitcoin was.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:33:48
I feel like any day the Bitoin price is going to all of a sudden explode out of nowhere to new highs, there is just too much good news coming out and the price isn't reflecting this news. Bitcoin is undervalued, as soon as the offshore money pours in and ETF's take off the price could go anywhere.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:02:15
I'll keep you updated
@_date: 2015-05-26 23:00:00

$500 around the corner, we going to see $2000 this week?
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:09:50
Currently dencentralized fiat is the  top priority this year, they are called gateways, or onramps, should be added very soon. Also you can take a look at the working being on for BTC gateway being added soon to Bitshares here:

of course they are, there is no other way around that, unless... you pay in cash like on localbitcoins, and with that there are risks.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:50:44
I upvoted!!! This is exciting news!!!
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:44:02
You have to download the wallet, to use the exchange, it will take a while to download the blockchain so be paitent, also it's still a little new, not even 1.0 yet so their working out the bugs. 
Download the wallet from their main site:

dude, get lost
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:26:05
He continues to write articles, when he should be using that time to code. I was invested in Bitshares but saw him writing more and more, which took away from Bitshares development, so I pulled the plug. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:53:07
that's what's important, work needs to get done... if he spent more time coding Bitshares would be at a higher market cap
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:31:14
not good enough, Dash is faster and doing more, Dash Evolution coming out this year
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:00:26
I hope this happens
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:50:09
i wish Daniel all the luck he can get, as for me I'm invested in someone who has been consistently coding non-stop, the guy is a robot and it's been paying off.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:11:53
I sold all my BTC yesterday, glad I did, look at the price. I went all in DASH, it's paying off.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:04:12
that will change soon with Dash Evolution
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:26:39
@_date: 2016-06-12 14:57:47

nobody wants US dollars, you should sell the stuff in your room that you don't need, put up a Garage Sale Sign with Only Accept Bitcoin on it, maybe someone shows up, worth a shot.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:09:37
You'd make $10.50 per day, if you buy 1000 NEO, price of neo at moment is under $50 so you'd get more. If gas price doubles you make over $20 per day, gas price used to be under $10 now its above $30
@_date: 2016-06-09 14:53:24
Just buy from Circle.com

Square Reader, download the app on your phone, make an account, type the amount, then type in the number of the card, make a signature with your finger, BAM wait 2 days for it to be in your bank account, then buy Bitcoin with Circle by connecting your back account.

Hello Tuesday!!!
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:47:07
It's supposed to crash, it's a bubble. Now suck it up and buy some more the next bubble is going to be bigger.
@_date: 2015-08-31 19:18:50
well all know that, but at least he's showing the Bitcoin logo to all his followers. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 05:36:36
Canada, you can use Advcash: 
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:37:13
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:26:31
This is huge news!!!
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:48:39
So does this mean sell Bitcoin and buy Bitcoin XT?
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:47:57
I say we have no mods, but just bots!!!
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:29:58


@_date: 2015-08-10 05:35:11
Circle.com you can add a credit card, then buy BTC, i think Circle is just the USA but I don't know.
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:44:38
me 2
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:21:36
dude have you been sleeping
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:43:51
Wow, next few days will get interesting if those users start buying BTC
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:28:38
you hit the nail
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:39:31
Tip Me!!! 
@_date: 2015-07-24 18:16:08
the cable has a virus
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:32:53
I my opinion the community should decide and power should bot be given to mods, Ive seen many times an good article upvoted, see the front page and then shortly after it's gone, because some mod wanted to exercise his power. Power to the people. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:21:46
Satoshi hasn't moved his Bitcoins for a long time, I assume he is with us no more :(
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:52:40
Good job, tweet this **** to everyone
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:39:07
You should put the locations of the BTC atm machines in Greece on there!!!!
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:40:59
lol, you know banks open safety deposit boxes, they have a separate key. And if they are at risk of going out of business they take what's inside, like in Greece.
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:19:12
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:44:15
easy, you hide fake trezors and recovery seeds all over the place, but the real one is out in the open everybody thinks it's just a painting on the wall, but it's not, there's a trezor inside the frame, **** i just revealed its location, oh well everyone will probably think it's fake
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:08:21
I'm glad I own Bitcoin....so when are we increasing the blocksize?
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:12:20
I would like to know if the moon landing was faked in the movie studio in the desert in the US, evidence please!!!
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:38:59
good, i'd rather want his supporters to buy bitcoins "first" than those naysayers that don't even deserve 1 satoshi
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:37:00
24k, that's a joke
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:21:04
so it would settle from 10,000 to 5,000? Is that what you're saying?
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:55:53
must be the winkivoss twins exchange slowly coming online
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:41:25
sweet, i just sent this tip to a new person that I converted to use Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:19:18
Awesome!!! 
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:23:43
 BitQuick iphone and android app with the ability to see surrounding BitQuick locations
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:08:46
how long does it take to get verified in order to buy bitcoin on coinbase?
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:51:34
Fantastic presentation!!!
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:52:10
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:42:05
I just told 3 people today about Bitcoin, they seem excited :) Every day I try to tell more people. Don't underestimate: Word of Mouth 
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:08:41
1 week - 2 weeks
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:01:53
I promoted Bitcoin today, got 1 new person to use it. Sent her a tip :)
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:30:41
Dude have her use Circle, it's so easy.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:52:44
why is it so high? Is this a good or bad thing?
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:05:16
Dude, if you don't like the direction in Bitcoin there are like 500 other cryptos to choose from, cryptos won't die, they are here to stay.
@_date: 2015-07-09 05:50:58
I wouldn't hire you either ;) 
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:32:08
so, when comes the Bitcoin crash and we move to Bitcoin XT?
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:56:42
I just told new 3 people today in Colombia about Bitcoin, they are very excited, but Bitcoin is hard to buy down here. Will BitQuick.co be available in South America soon? What are you plans for expansion?
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:45:03
Wagecan: 
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:47:55
Circle.com is so easy, they have iphone and android app as well
@_date: 2015-07-04 00:10:41
I think you can insert cash
@_date: 2015-07-03 06:03:28
because i need to buy more than the weekly limit
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:43:29
This is almost better than: It's happening!!!
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:54:08
not a bug, this is it, strap yourselves in boys
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:19:40
It's what I've been saying the whole time, China is pumping this, not Greece. But if the Wallstreet Journal says it's Greece it must be true? lol
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:55:14
I love Doge, much lov!!!!
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:29:43
In a bookstore in Acharnai in northern Athens, Greece, i found the image from this article: 
@_date: 2015-07-25 06:13:48
I hope they make an iPhone app
@_date: 2016-02-05 20:55:04
1 crypto isn't good, ETH and DASH both have great tech, BTC the giant dinosaur is boggled down with it's own problems
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:26:45
hydrogen peroxide therapy will help her, look on Amazon for "food grade hydrogen peroxide" people put a few drops in water and drink 3 times per day and it opens everything up. More oxygen in the body means a healthier body. It's cheap, do research on it.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:44:18
I know plenty about other businesses that use reddit to promote themselves, but I would like have the power to exercise my "downvote" where I feel is necessary than have a "few" mods in charge making the decisions for everyone. That said, I know that the mods "love" doing their job and "love" the power that comes with it. And since reddit is setup to be like this, no point in discussing further. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 01:49:34
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:39:06
i want to download OpenBazaar now!!!
@_date: 2015-07-02 23:18:37
i just opened an account with them, $5,250 is the weekly limit and it arrives in 7 days? Can anyone confirm this, do they sometimes do what Coinbase does and cancel the transaction?
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:11:38
Wagecan is good
@_date: 2016-02-05 00:32:19
thanks bro, that chart made me sell my house, my car, my Xbox, $55,000 stash of Gold coins, took out a $70,000 bank loan, sold my wife's diamond ring, she wants a divorce, who the f cares, feels good to go all in, fingers crossed!!!
@_date: 2016-02-06 16:29:35
Why don't Bitcoiners do a Kickstarter Event to purchase an island in the Caribbean for development of the Bitcoin Island, with airport runway, hotels, gambling, etc.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:59:57
Once they get out, they'll be rich 
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:45:53
Someone start a kickstarter event and call it BitOS
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:31:35
lol, that woman that said wizard hats needs to be fired. How dare she make fun of THE BITCOIN WIZARD
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:56:01

@_date: 2015-07-01 07:40:28
FULL INTERVIEW PLEASE!!!!
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:23:39
that's awesome, looking forward to it :)
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:15:48
dude, do your own research and come to your own conclusions, I remember reading an article from WSJ saying that Bitcoin is going up because of Greece. And most here in r/Bitcoin agree with me, I got 9 points, you got 0.
@_date: 2015-07-09 03:56:44
This is brilliant, why not offer a chocolate bar with the Bitcoin logo!?! Mass adoption overnight!!! Man sometimes I think I'm genius.
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:28:45
two tips
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:48:24
dude not cool
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:51:05
Where's the flag? 
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:06:55
I agree WageCan is better
@_date: 2015-04-13 17:00:01
how many months? around the corner sound more like years to me
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:50:50
did that fix it?
@_date: 2015-04-18 04:34:43
I don't have to say anything, Todd said all that I needed to know.
@_date: 2015-04-15 19:47:45
That's why I own Dash, Bitcoin will always be attacked since it's 
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:47:40


lol, does your computer make automatic backups, because you might just restore to an earlier backup.
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:56:03
here we go!!!
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:45:01
I'd like my 5 Bitcoin back, everyone should get their Bitcoins back.
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:07:11
not selling right now, but yes I will in the future
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:04:27
I want a Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:58:59
Nice app!!! 
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:51:57
in the meantime if you have some spare change put it into Dash, with every new update the price spikes.
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:45:21
how much do they want you to pay?
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:30:59
I predict $400 by next weekend
@_date: 2015-09-29 00:27:28
I hope Mercado Libre in Colombia starts accepting Bitcoin, please, please, please

@_date: 2015-04-16 00:23:53
wait women are allowed to use computers?
@_date: 2015-09-08 03:09:08
its on the right side
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:48:47
Dude, they said next week the OTC Bitcoin Trust will begin trading. Just wait 1 more week, NYSE and NASDAQ are competing against each other to be the first to get Bitcoin trading. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:31:16
better than trusting Todd
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:11:06
Woot Woot
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:11:53
Bitcoin already has a bad name, there is nothing to lose
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:35:50
yep, happened to me too, 3000. so cool!!!
@_date: 2015-09-29 03:58:34
you couldn't of said it better
@_date: 2015-04-16 06:10:05
I don't feel comfortable with Peter Todd as a core dev on Bitcoin, I just switched to Dash. Thanks Todd for making it easy for me.
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:27:36

@_date: 2015-09-02 02:41:30
Impeach theymos!!!
@_date: 2015-09-20 20:38:34
so when will Bitcoin start going up? Devs up in a plane is this a sign? maybe we should launch them to the moon
@_date: 2015-09-29 02:18:54
backed by trust
@_date: 2015-09-29 04:38:12
i don't want to give him my email, what's in the video? 
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:42:34
Dash is way more anonymous than Bitcoin, and soon to get even more with the next update...
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:15:25
where's the Ron Paul "its happening" gif when you need it
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:28:01
attacking is good, makes Bitcoin even stronger
@_date: 2015-09-28 15:11:29
more like 14,000, can't believe it
@_date: 2015-09-12 20:09:49
Just bought 10 Bitcoin, here we go...
@_date: 2015-11-30 22:15:08
$25 is a ripoff, should be $5
@_date: 2015-11-30 00:20:08
Use Circle.com instead of Coinbase to buy Bitcoin. Download their iphone or android app. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:44:01
wrong address, send them to my changetip please
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:13:53
Every week that we get closer to the bitcoin halving the price jumps $50.
@_date: 2015-11-11 01:42:32
what do you want to buy?
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:02:52
I'm German, these people will eventually get kicked out. Neo-Nazis are growing more in numbers in order to send a strong message to the invaders. Merkel will get thrown out by her own party, already they sent a bill without her knowledge thru the congress, but she found out about it. It's getting tense in Germany, the german people will put leaders in place to deport them all.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:57:14
i might sell at $5000, maybe
@_date: 2015-11-14 19:22:07
that's the most arrogant comment ever
@_date: 2015-09-30 00:59:35
Doesn't install properly on a mac.... :(

CNBC ARTICLE SCREENSHOT BEFORE IT WAS DELETED 
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:50:40
in 38 weeks we have the bitcoin halving, price will surge for anther 38 weeks
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:54:49
In my opinion there should be no mods, the community should be control voting things up and down, I like wars against trolls. Increases exposure for the Reddit Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-10-16 00:53:43
Ok, redditsilver.gif
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:50:56
you should go to all the popular hotels in Barbados and ask them to accept Bitcoin, that way foreigners with Bitcoin from other countries will come and spend their BTC. :)
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:53:30
play with me bitcoin tit tac toe: 
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:47:28
Why would you sell at these prices? Bitcoin has entered into a Bull Market and not to mention, the Bitcoin halving in 38 weeks.
@_date: 2015-03-16 23:47:26


it's funny
@_date: 2015-10-25 14:34:58
Well, 1 Bitcoin won't hurt. That's only $290 as of right now.

old video on CNN, lol
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:18:04
I'm the last tip, does the last tip get $5 too?
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:18:20
me too i got 10 as well at 230
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:05:21

this morning 260, glad I bought yesterday :)
@_date: 2015-11-30 00:25:25
It's way more user friendly, plus less intrusive than Coinbase. Easy to setup.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:31:17
link to video?
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:50:54
people want money fast, I don't want to wait 2 hours for someone to learn about Bitcoin at the Bitcoin ATM, rather is would be better if on the sides of the ATM are introductory videos and information on how to setup a wallet, etc.
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:37:06
I bought ten shovels yesterday, selling at 10,000
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:51:49

Selling my Bitcoin for half price, $500,000, limited time only, this offer won't last, come get it before you miss out on your chance to double your profits!!!

@_date: 2015-10-16 13:51:41
i felt it this morning when I saw the price at 260
@_date: 2015-10-09 12:59:30
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:54:59
Circle.com, but they have limits, but they increase your limit with time. CC or bank accounts.
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:22:45
Me!!!!!! Everyone owns me big time
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:14:09
try 
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:31:01
sure you can, it's called a rush
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:34:48
glad I bought 10 BTC yesterday, bought more today, Bitcoin way undervalued
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:24:06
that's like saying the post office needs to go on trial for unknowingly sending illegal stuff thru the mail
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:55:35
well, coinbase has a wordpress bitcoin plugin, i'd imagine they'd be adding ETH to it as well, so any website that adds the coinbase wordpress plugin to their site can sell any product for ETH!!!
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:27:12
How much interest earned per year with JoinMarket?
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:53:51
I'll buy your Bitcoin for $100. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 20:51:30
when is the new one going to be available? will it have all the features of the android app?
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:14:38
what happend to the Mycelium iphone app?
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:17:15
I criticize to improve bitcoin, not to hurt it. Like I said, developers need to fix this problem. Not pointing out the problem is like kicking the can down the road.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:48:40
$300 nihau!!!!
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:06:39

@_date: 2015-10-25 20:58:34
naw, that's too high
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:29:49
I have a feeling...
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:52:49
What you want to do is install the Square app on your phone, make an account, then you type in the number of the card expiration etc, and in 3 business day you have the money on your Square account, transfer than money to your bank and buy bitcoin with Circle.
