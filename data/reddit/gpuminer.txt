Plus I see Coinbase have a "partial system outage" right now...
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:56:18
Just got one too. Thing is, I haven't used a crypto exchange for years. I lost a load when Cryptsy went down, never really got over it. Trying to work out what damage these hackers could do? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:05:13
I'm absolutely betting it's them, given the "outage" message.

Actually, based on what  and the OP said, it must be Coinbase, cos I literally created an account there at the weekend but never got so far as doing any trading. Does everyone else here have a Coinbase account?

btc-e, Linkedin, Kickstarter.

Yeah. I certainly would never interact with the Huobi site, more likely than not to be a honeypot of some kind IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:08:07
Just tried calling them and they are unable to take calls due to the "high number" of calls they're experiencing.

Can only trace it as far as 54.240.27.55 which is an AWS address. Could be a legit crypto exchange, or a phish, I don't have the skills to tell.

Ha! I did have a btc-e account way back when also, and I never knew they'd been pwned.

Yeah, I'm old enough to be this "dumbfuck"s dad and avoiding this kind of trolling is why I prefer the doge scene.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:32:02
spot on :) thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:18:49
Much thanks! And you're very close... too close :)

bitcoin == trollcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:28:11
Nor do I. Otherwise I wouldn't have been so blasphemous :)

He's only 29. Hurtful memories of the playground are no doubt still fresh.

Re. the multi-pool thing, I'm just checking in from r/dogecoin and without wanting to start any kind of flame-war, I have mined over $2000 worth of doge in a month; in fact, it's pretty much all I've mined since setting up my rig. I appreciate there's been inflation of the doge price in that time, but whenever I tried to mine LTC directly it was really unprofitable.

Maybe Bitcoin is indeed an omnipotent god, and just like god it needs us lowly humans to make blasphemy laws it protect its holy ass. Cos it can't stand up for its omnipotent self :)
