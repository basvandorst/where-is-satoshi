I originally set up my Korbit account with the intent of sending money home on the cheap.  I got fed up with conversion rates, plus taking a hit from both my Korean and American banks.  I linked the Korbit account to my Korean bank but I couldn't set up an account back home (since I don't live there and haven't lived there for a long time).  So I started to hodl.  Best. Decision. Ever.  Thank you Korean banks for sucking balls and forcing me to find a way around your ball sucking!  Sparkling!

To open the Korbit account I just needed a bill with my name linked to my address, my foreigner ID card+number (in place of national ID), bank name+account number, and a few other things that were easy to provide.  The residency proof plus Korea ID keep most people from setting up an account for arbitrage.

I think it's a conspiracy of the 8 fairy goddesses.  They know they are about to be outed/thrown in jail so they are funneling their money into btc in order to send it outside of the country.

Did you notice the BTCC and OkCoin prices?  We are trading around 100usd higher than the Chinese exchanges.
Do you think we could turn a profit by selling now and buying back later tonight/tomorrow when the price evens out?  I'm hesitant to do anything but hodl.  I don't need the money but just staring at this situation is curious as hell.  I really want to understand it.

But &gt;100usd difference?  This is the first I've seen the spread so wide (in Korea, India and China are different stories).
