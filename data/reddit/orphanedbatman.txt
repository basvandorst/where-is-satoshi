Popularity has definantly increased and new people have gotten into it. It was on sale when it was 10$ a coin but I know I didn't buy any then.

Hey friend! I'm currently on my phone at work right now but if you're interested I'd be more than willing to have a discussion with you about crypto!
I don't pretend to know everything about crypto, but I feel confident enough in my research to explain why I believe in it, or at the very least, believe it's worth keeping an eye on!

SegWit, it seems to be the hot topic right now but I'd be lying if I said I had any idea what it means or how it works aside from the fact that it paves the way for lightning integration.

I'm sorry, I just got involved in Bitcoin in the last month. I don't k ow what the proper strategy is, but last night I bought in the first time I saw a 50$ spike up.
I had my finger on the trigger because I figured when it moved, it would move quickly. I may have gotten lucky, but it worked. Next time it happens I'll have studied better and maybe catch some more obvious signs.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:31:44
I was positive it was. Being new to this thing, what am I supposed to be looking for that makes this revolutionary? You don't have to explain it all to me, just some type of source would be greatly appreciated! I'm spongeing up all I can right now and I need to keep sucking it in before I inevitably get burnt out.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:14:45
Hi I'm new and I don't really understand what's really happening here. I k ow they didn't just send me a whole real bitcoin, is this whole system just set up for testing right now and will go live later?

I've introduced 3 people so far and all 3 have bought in. I make it as appetizing as possible and when they are really hooked I give them some information to try to make them doubt it.
If they get interested at first and then they feel like you are trying to talk them out of it then they will be motivated to research it. At the same time it frees you of any blame because, even though you introduced it to them (and made it sound really good too), all they remember is you trying to talk them out of it.
Stress research, answer simple questions, defer difficult ones to your favorite sources, and don't be afraid to tell them to google bitcoin. If they find information on the internet that scares them away instantly (no matter how much bullshit it contains) they aren't quite ready to make the plunge in my opinion.
I hope you are filthy rich and happy as a clam!

Didn't Mt.Gox drop the price of bitcoin around 80%? The bad news causes fear and panic selling, at least that's how I interpret it.

As awful as it may seem, I love the memes and I love the price threads. I come here to feel good about my investment, I come here to get re-energized with my commitment to bitcoin.
I have other sources to learn more about bitcoin. I like good discussion on this sub, but what I really like is seeing a lot of people excited and having fun. It's one of the best ways to garner interest in newcomers too!
A genuine belief and love in something you are supporting is always a fantastic way to turn others to your cause. I come here for the pep-rally, and I almost always leave satisfied!

I feel like a blind man watching a couple have sex. I have an idea what's going on, but I'm not getting those juicy details...
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:20:13
I personally feel that investing more than you can afford to lose is 100% you personally handle price volitility. 
If you are 100% confident you can handle losing all of your money then you will be fine. As long as there is a clear path to recovery, if something goes wrong you will be okay.
You have to take into account how family will handle your loss of money and the stress it would put on them because that would affect you. Once you have taken all of this into account, if you are still worried then you have too much invested.
It's all about personal sanity and recovery of funds in my opinion, only you know how you can handle the emotional burden that could be tossed upon you and your family.

Hi! It gains value over time for a couple of reasons imo. 
1. It becomes more scarce obviously that's because people hear about it, get interested, and buy some. That's fewer bitcoins in the market increasing rarity and the trend have shown that it also increases value. Also, less bitcoins are released over time, every 4 years the amount of bitcoin mined and released to the market halves, less BTC to buy.
2. Technological improvements are made to BTC making them easier to use, acquire, and more popular.
These two things go hand in hand. If BTC stops gaining popularity then the incentive to improve upon the concept decreases and vice versa.
There is no guarantee that bitcoin will be worth anything tomorrow so you always have to try to keep your finger on the pulse. There is also no guarantee that bitcoin will ever be this cheap again.
Like anything it's a risk, but I hope I've helped you understand it at least a little better!

That's one of the ideas I had, obviously I'd need to become a lot more knowledgeable about it but I do know the market is pretty scarce in my area.
Any suggestions on how to get the ball rolling on something like that? Generate interest and actually convince people that they need to hear about this?

The enemy of my enemy... Right now, BTC and LTC want the same thing, as long as he is on our side I'm happy to be on his 
He doesn't seem hell bent on killing BTC and I'm fine with that. If something happens down the road and he starts sowing discord then I'll change my opinion, but right now he's a good guy.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:31:25
I'm a crypto-optimist I guess, but I just bought in some more! The dip is what I was waiting for and even though it might fall more today, it does seem to have stabilized for the moment!
I'm expecting good things from BTC and though I can't afford much, I'm still putting some in 5o back up my belief. For every naysayer,there is a dillusional optimist, I may be one of them but at least you get to hear both extremes!
