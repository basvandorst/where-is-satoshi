If you agree to sell your BTC with that lock in price if it goes to 1 Million USD we can have a written agreement.
To simplfy if it goes to 0 I will buy your BTC for todays price. If it goes to 2X of todays price, you will sell me your BTC for todays price. Do you agree?

no one is forcing you to have one! just use whatever you want and be happy with it.
But it seems to me that you are not happy with your decision of "not wanting BTC".
Do you know who doesn't want BTC? my friends! do you know what they tell me everyday? nothing! do you know what I tell them? nothing! We are all happy with our decisions and we don't need to brag/shame other side for their decisions.

I paid 8 USD to transfer my bitcoin just now. So if you buy 10 USD worth 8 USD will go to Tx Fees... 
That is why people say BTC is no good for micro transactions.

To ease your mind, even if market collapses you can always sell me your bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:07:47
a lot? do you mean the part I say beginning with "it seems to me that you are not happy ..."
As you can read I am telling what his point seems to me. I am not assuming it is my understanding from what OP says. My understanding not an assumption about OP's happiness...

yeah this is very accurate. I am sure the Guardian and the media industry has zero carbon footprint!
They don't use paper, electricity, heating, mass offices, distribution by trucks. They are all working from eco-friendly homes and never wasting paper instead they are only using internet and their servers are fed only by renewable energy.
I don't even want to mention the eco-friendliness and humanitarian way of the defense industry in general...

If I were you I wouldn't risk all, I would risk just 20-30%. This way if BTC rises some of your debt will be paid by BTC, if BTC falls you wouldn't be in much debt just 20-30% more.

this is sarcasm right? we are up 16% since last week! 81% since last month what kind of bear market are you talking about?
If this is a bear I would be hugging him while I sleep peacefully with my BTC... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:22:49
you don't say...
I love how this "experts" struggle to define BTC and analyze it....
BTC is this, BTC is that, it is a bubble no it is a rocket, it is gold, no it is currency...
Thank you Satoshi for showing us how fool this guys really are...

I wrote following on another thread but I will copy the relevant parts here also.
Cypto can not be compared with Stock exchange at the moment, there is no holiday, there is no closing and opening, even the price of BTC changes dramatically between different exchanges. no one country can screw up BTC completely.
It can not be compared to foreign exchange, commodity bacause unlike currency there is no one ruling country, unlike commodity there is no season, draught and etc...
Law makers are confused about how to evaluate it and which laws apply to it...
Comparing it with previous performance is also nonsense because it is still in development phase. BTC is not in its final form we are still having soft and hard forks...
No one knows what will happen. You can not make fundamental analysis because fundamentally it is basically a distributed database, you can not make technical analysis because rules of technical analysis mainly work on stable and saturated markets. Crypto is run by FUD and FOMO at the moment...
if it breaks 10K it can run to 100 Kin 3 months or it can pull back to 300 USD in 3 months... The rules are different than any other thing that you ever seen...
If you want to invest just invest burning money in crypto and wait... When you reach your moon (what ever that is) take out your money and leave...
If you think block-chain is the future, than loosing money doesn't mean anything for you, because you believe in this "revolution"

hahahaa, dude my difficulty level in life is harder than most people here because of the country that I was born.
Yeah I may be a pussy but US,EU,CAN governments are like heaven for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:00:11
Well if you think about NYSE it is also in ATH and wall street thinks that it is in a bubble. Don't you think big money will make more money shorting NYSE? 
Additionally as you know US and EU are not dominant in BTC market. JPN, CHN and KRW combined own around 50% of the market cap. Basically it won't crush like NYSE or NASDAQ because BTC market is fed by a lot of countries.
We only focus on US markets because of language barrier and Social media but we don't know what investors in Japan, Korea or China is planning.

I am not saying you are wrong (time will tell that) but people in reddit tend to make one mistake; you think US dominates BTC market!. This is not true! This is way different than any other market/commodity/currency or whatever you want to classify BTC as.
There is nothing else this distributed. Distributed by country, by wealth, by ideology by everything.
I am not saying BTC is the answer, tomorrow morning BTC may be 0.1 cents (who knows?) but comparing it to other conventional things is wrong... 
Comparing it to gold is also wrong IMO. Because Gold was centralized by governments/kingdoms/religions. May be comparing it to diamond may make more sense... There is no real value in diamond yet people tend to pay thousand USD or even annihilate nations  for "good quality" diamond...
Also we are living in a very very very different era right now. We are more connected than ever, we are more mobile than ever, we are more fast than ever, we have more freedom of speech than ever. All of us are potential newspapers, TV stations, record labels... All conventional things of last century changed. Now it is time to change the financial systems because for most of us living outside 1st world countries and stuck up with high inflation and currencies that are loosing value everyday against other currencies we have no other choice. 
A government decided to ban Paypal for that reason people lost their incomes, other government decided to fight against US or Russia so their money is not accepted anywhere.  As Apple/Microsoft changed the way we work, as amazon changed the retail market, financial systems is now changing. MAy be BTC or CC is not the answer yet but BTC will give birth to something that will change the finance...
I always tell people who want to invest in unconventional and unproven things; only invest with burning money and always have an exit plan before you invest...
Same is true for BTC. It is not an investment it is a revolution/technology/ideology... It will be binary you will either succeed or get burned...
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:30:19
Amen to that! May be one day we can use blockchain  instead of parliament...
Hail Blockchain!
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:16:54
Yeah for that reason I love to believe that 1 BTC will be  1 Mill USD within 5 years.
A mid class guy can only hope right :))

Dude Bitconnect is definitely a Ponzi Scam...
As long as there are newcomers it will continue to grow. But the moment there are no new comers and when the market crashes (believe me all markets crash) Bitconnect people will vanish in to thin air!
If you want to use them, just use them, because first comers and smart leavers of ponzi schemes can make money. 
Just be smart and take out your initial investment gradually ASAP... 
I would suggest to use any Ponzi scheme like the following:
1- Have a ROI in mind. For example I would like to get 20% back for my initial investment within 1 years. Put in an amount that you can loose (like 110 USD) then let it complete one minimum ponzi scheme cycle. After 1st minimum cycle for ex you got 112 USD. Try to take out 12 USD.. This is the test if you can get your money from this scam. 
Now that you see this scam is paying you back and as your ROI expectation is 20% what you need to try is to take out 120 USD ASAP.
To do that complete  2- 3 minimum cycles. After that lets say you will have 106 USD as an example. take out 16 USD. Repeat this until you got out all your initial investment + ROI.
When you completed that, The remaining amount inside is basicaly free money. Now you can do whatever you want with that. But I would suggest taking out the gains all the time.

That is why we have Satoshi.
"Each bitcoin (BTC) is divisible to the 8th decimal place, so each BTC can be split into 100,000,000 units"
So if 1 BTC is 1Million USD 1 Satoshi will be 0.01 USD meaning 1 cents... 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:46:46
Oh, thanks for the grammar lesson (I really mean it, no sarcasm here)

Blockchain is here to stay, BTC or other CC can vanish but there is no turning back from blockchain now. 
For finance we still need a decentralized/more free system. Whether BTC or CC or a new thing, I don't want banks or governments to decide if I can have a bank account or not.
Additionally with BTC there are no borders or time or weekend or holiday or limit...
It is very hard to classify and analyze...
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:24:29
I don't want to over throw anything but I want the finance system changed! 
It is not fair for banks and instutions decide who can have a bank account or not. It is not fair that when they go bankrupt people needs to pay!.
We changed media, we changed retail, we changed production, we changed transportation... now it is time for finance!

1- Fork is a utensil that you generally eat food
2- "Crash" was in 2004. I am not sure if it still runs in your local theatre. But you can always get the DVD 
3- No neither fork nor DVDs cost that much. Unless you are not extremely poor you don't need to cash out everything. 
4- You should ask your doctor or pharmacist about side effects.
5- I got bored
6- You literally know nothing
7- There is a website called google.com you should check it out!
