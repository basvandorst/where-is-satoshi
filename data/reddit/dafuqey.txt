yeah, bitcoin may be money but it failed to be a currency. It failed to appeal to public as good medium of exchange because its value fluctuate too much and most people are having hard time understanding its value.
@_date: 2015-12-17 02:25:37
people who treat bitcoin as investment is making bitcoin fail.
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:59:28
Bitcoin was designed as currency. But people are treating it like a stock since they expect growth from it. This causes bitcoin's value to fluctuate whenever it gets public's attention (or occurrence of any event). Fluctuating stocks can be traded but cannot be used as currency.

Well.. Credit card companies backs credit card transaction.So in case of fraud you will get reimbursed. With bitcoin, this is not possible. -this is mostly where fee comes in.
Also, plastic card with magnetic strip is much more convenient than using e-wallet for most ppl.
Bitcoin has already failed since it is not simple enough for senior ppl (65+) to use it. PPl who has most money.

I thought charts of blockchain.info represent number of bitcoin bought not number of goods purchased with bitcoin. What I read is that while more sellers are accpeting bitcoin less buyers are using bitcoin to purchase goods becuase of anticipation that the value of bitcoin will increase. In other words, ppl will not use bitcoin to purchase(not exchange) goods unless the price is dropped or stablized.
However, right now, only small portion of population are using the bitcoin and there are limited amount of bitcoin out there. As more ppl use/buy bitcoin, price will go up. Therefore, ppl will keep their bitcoin for investment and less ppl are going to use bitcoin to purchase good.
If true, this is serious flaw of bitcoin as currency. I think this issue has to be addressed or it will ultimately fail as currency. (but it will make some ppl rich)

It's called legal tender.

I agree with you. I think this is a fabricated story by a layman. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:02:09
I agree. Paper money is backed by gov and bitcoin is backed by abstract idea. That's why you can not seek remedy when there is a problem. It's not question about backed by what idea, tech, security features or thing.. it is about backed by whom? (gold is backed by inherent value which paper currency and bitcoin doesnt have)
And I do not agree with you that paper currency will either decrease in value or cease to exist. Paper currency will exist for long time. Perhaps forever. Because it is the easiest way to transact business(you just need two person and piece of paper and you have legally binding business transaction) and digital currency can not achieve this. (u need electricity at minimum)
P.S.: Anything in the world can be counterfeited, copied or stolen including bitcoin. Where there is a will, there's a way. Never underestimate ingenuity of criminal minds.

And most companies who are starting to accept bitcoin are not profiting and have bad cash flow.

Any investment which has return needs to be taxed. Being taxed means being regulated. Regulation is last thing bitcoin wants.

Paper money is backed by gov. bitcoin is backed by nothing.

@_date: 2014-03-05 06:22:58
I dont understand your definition of "backed"
Federal reserve note -&gt; "note" means promise to pay -&gt; gov pays = backed by gov aka legal tender. Also paper currency is backed by state of art security features like micro spider icons.
Anyway being decentralized is not good for bitcoin. it makes it too vulnerable to evildoers and when harm is done purposefully or accidentally, there will be no1 you can sue. That's why I don't think bitcoin is backed by anything.
@_date: 2014-09-05 17:23:44
The reason I don't think bitcoin will accept widely is that ppl still  consider it as investment rather than a tool.
@_date: 2014-01-22 02:38:15
I have 3 questions: 1) Isn't bitcoin more of stock then currency? People are investing their money into bitcoin and as bitcoin price rise, less ppl are using bitcoin to purchase goods. 2) will bitcoin be only crypto/digital currency by its own? or will there be emergence of other brand/named digital currency? What will be the effect of it? 3) How do you think gov't will tax bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:34:50
Actually, any ppl who wish bitcoin price to go up are not ppl who appreciate purpose of bitcoin. Bitcoin needs to be currency with stable price. Not investment. As long as ppl trying to make money out of investing bitcoin, bitcoin will not become currency.

Good Luck OP.
However, I still don't think future is positive for bitcoin as long as people think it as investment rather than instrument. I rather invest that money in Gold or Euro right now. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:09:38
Price of bitcoin is determined by supply/demand. I do not think demand of bitcoin will be high in the future.
Why would people use currency that is unstable and has falling price to do away with 3~5% credit card fee? 
There will not be enough demand for bitcoin to reach $1 trillion.

As long as bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that does not guarantee a secure transaction (reverse transaction), people will 
discredit bitcoin. Honest people do not need anonimity in financial transaction.

Yup. Anything money related (currency, stock, gold etc) is evil and draw evil things especially greed. It was so naive that people thought BTC would be ideal form of currency without dark side.

Well but if you take that power from the government, how it will run the country? The government will be useless and the country will be more fucked up. Collapse of government will lead to anarchy and anarchy would not be good for economy. Even though the current government is fucked up, if you take that power, how can a next government operate?

A long as people treat bitcoin as investment rather than currency, it will not gain any more public interest and eventually fail and will be forgotten. IMO greed of people already ruined core value of bitcoin.

yup I am a prudent supporter rather than naysayer. Well, currently I think biggest difference between WU and Bitcoin is whether they are regulated and taxed. Since bitcoin is emerging currency, there is virtually little or no tax. However, once bitcoin become mainstream, it will be subject to various taxes and regulations. Do not say bitcoin is not subject to tax and regulation (it is already being regulated in certain part of the world. Bitcoin will not be regulated by central authority but multiple authorities will regulate with its own standard). So in the end, there might be tax on exchange, tax on sending abroad, tax on receiving, and tax on exchange again.

Only problem is that if the bitcoin market collapses, your tax money or bitcoin money or any profit or benefit derived from bitcoin will still goes to same people you hate.
Banks are not dummies.. they are far smarter than code monkeys. Trust me, if bitcoin works and become even more sensational, they will be the first people to abuse it and they will not have any mercy on it.
In the end, banks and bitcoin are going to become one and nothing will change.
Money is root of evil. bitcoin is money after all. Bitcoin will become evil in the end and it wont be pretty.

@_date: 2013-12-11 23:09:45
I disagree.
Govt may not be able to regulate bitcoin, but it sure can regulate people or entity. You are right that bitcoin is too hard to regulate because of its nature. But gov can prohibit business's accepting bitcoin. You don't need to control instruments (bitcoin) when you can cotrol people.

My theory 1: more and more regulations here and there -&gt; increased transaction and exchange fee -&gt; become impractical.
My theory 2: Gov approves bitcoin transaction -&gt; more country uses bitcoin -&gt; become chaotic and troublesome -&gt; nations make international organization controlling bitcoin (centralized)
My theory 3: emergence of great hakcers -&gt; steal a lot of bitcoin (more bitcoin user = more bitcoin robber) -&gt; no available remedy -&gt; Gov take affirmative action or ppl lose faith in bitcoin
My theory 4: Bitcoin become viable -&gt; wealth bankers manipulate and abuse it -&gt; bitcoin market crashes (this is what bankers are best at) -&gt; stuck in this limbo (no one can fix it, no one has to fix it, since decentralized... no bail out available)
My theory 5: US ban bitcoin on theory that it support terrorism/drug trafficing (i.e. usuage of bitcoin by North Koreans) -&gt; declare use of bitcoin is act of supporting "axis of evil" -&gt;invade countries supporting bitcoin -&gt; fuck em up and take their resources
