Bitcoin is going to be the AOL of cryptos.  It was first, it was groundbreaking, it got super popular, but it failed to keep up with competitors.  If they can't even implement segwit there's no reason to think they will outlast altcoins who have better designs.

The difference is that gold has intrinsic value due to its applications in jewelry and electronics.  All things used as stores of value have stable demand for the underlying asset be it gold, oil, copper, real estate, etc.  
Bitcoin's only intrinsic value is its use as a currency.  If that part fails then it can't succeed as a store of value either.

I agreed with him on the codebase so I'm not sure why you're bringing up forks and such.  
My point was that a relatively small number holding most of the coins gives them a lot of power.  Not power to change the code, but unchecked economic power in the case that bitcoin takes over.  
You may say "I'm fine with that, what's the issue" but you now have 1000 people who can bribe anyone they want for any reason, and do it completely anonymously, forever without ever running out of coins.  If crypto was really going to take over it'd have to be an alt coin with a more widespread distribution to avoid this issue.

Gen X is working.  Baby boomers are half retired and vocal about it.  Millenials are half employed and vocal about it.  Gen X got cheap college and a booming 90s job market so they are almost entirely employed, working long hours, and doing quite well.  They currently account for the majority of manager positions in US corporations. 
They are busy and successful so less active in politics today.  That will probably change when the boomers in congress all retire.

No, that figure would include Broad Money (M3) supply.  
[This page explains them well]( but is a bit outdated (from 2008 just before the recession).
Edit: Also consider how the US economy is 18.5 trillion while the USD monetary base is 3.9 trillion.  You only need so much currency to run an economy. 
Edit2: Also consider that US government debt is 19 trillion, household debt is 12.7 trillion, and MB is 3.9T.  Another example of how debt is not a 1:1 correlation to currency or asset valuations

Bitcoin I agree with you, but blockchain has value.  In the future we'll probably use it to manage solar grids.  Everyone in the city has solar panels and hooks up to the blockchain with smart contracts.  If I have extra power I can automatically sell it to you for SolarCoins or wtfever.  Then power company lets me exchange SolarCoins back into USD and takes a % fee for managing the blockchain and doing the exchange.  
Obviously bitcoin is unfeasible for that application, but some other blockchain will be implemented for solar power.

If BTC were 10 mil then the market cap would be 170 trillion.  
Total government issued fiat currency in the world is about 7.5 trillion.  In the "dream scenario" where every country in the world completely abandons government issued fiat and adopts bitcoin instead the price would be about 350,000.
There's a serious misunderstanding in the btc community about how valuable bitcoin would be in this ideal situation.  This isn't FUD, it's basic math.

Moore's Law specifically refers to transistor density on a silicon integrated circuit.  Silicon Atoms are .2nm wide, which means the minimum high-k dielectric layer you can put on a chip is .2nm (1 atom).  Considering this and the quantum interference problem transistors show when they are only a few atoms wide, 3nm is almost certainly the end of the road.  That's just 15 atoms between components.
Sure - we'll probably develop quantum computers or other advancements, but Moore's Law ends with silicon.

Because of these factors and some others they view the financial system as rigged and stacked against them.

The gross world product is 78 trillion per year in economic activity.  The world has 63 trillion in government debt,  56 trillion in public debt, 75 trillion in financial sector debt, and 92 trillion in household/private debt.
All of that debt and economic activity is conducted using 4.7 trillion in paper currency and 25 trillion in digital currency (bank deposits, liquid assets, etc).  That's a ratio of 223:30 or 7.5:1 for how much debt there is in the world to currency.  They are not 1:1 correlated.

The original article states that a relatively few people "control" bitcoin. We discussed that the foundation that controls the codebase is relatively small. We discussed that the number of people holding most of the coins is a relatively small, thus giving them a lot of control.

All of the exchanges design their rules so that it's easy to buy and difficult to sell.  It's an artificial deterrent from large scale selling to try to avoid crashes.

Yes.  Dogecoin is a clone of scrypt that was launched as a tongue-in-cheek way to spread the doge meme.

I think you're confusing debt with money supply.  Debt is just a promise of future economic activity, it has no value by itself.  If I borrow 200 btc from you that doesn't mean 200 more coins now exist or affect the value of the coins themselves. 
Just look at the 2008 mortgage meltdown to understand how debt is a bad estimator of value.  
  Bitcoin is a liquid money supply which can be used to conduct economic activity.  The closest equivalent to that would be the world M1 narrow money supply which is about 30 trillion worldwide.  Even in that scenaro the cap is 1.4 million (plus inflation).

I assume you understood basic fundamentals of governance, my fault.  
Government collects USD in taxes, if you don't pay taxes you go to jail.  The only way around this is armed revolution which is a wholly independent concept from crypto.
The government will NEVER collect taxes in another currency as doing so diminishes their own power and ability to govern.  2000+ years of history supports this argument fully.
To convert BTC into USD you need financial companies: banks, exchanges, etc. All of these can be sued for records (already happening with coinbase), regulated, or even seized if it comes down to it.  
To spend BTC you must still interact with companies all of whom can be sued/regulated/seized.
This means that even if government can't touch the blockchain they can limit your ability to use your coins for anything tangible.  Can't buy a car - dealership will get shut down.  Can't buy food - grocery store will be fined millions.  etc. 
If they truly chose to stop it they could.
Your main mistake here is assuming that I'm arguing bitcoin will fail when I said nothing of the sort.  I simply said if the goverment CHOSE to stop it they could.  This doesn't mean it can't exist as a useful asset that is monitored and taxed by the government.  It just means it's not a path to "monetary sovereignty".

Transaction speed was identified years ago and solved in literally every alt coin since, but bitcoin has refused to make any changes to fix that issue.

Torrents are not a very big threat to the government.  Few hundred million dollars in lost revenue for some media companies.  They pressured government to intervene, but they chose to stay out of it.  Look at all the court cases over copyrights that happened as a result of torrenting.  The government didn't throw the book at anybody and largely reduced penalties.  If they had instead chosen to throw people in jail and charge millions in fines would torrenting be as popular today? Unlikely.
Besides, as a result of the government's unwillingness to go after internet piracy it has forced those media companies to develop low-cost streaming solutions that are becoming more popular than torrents.  It's actually a good case of the government showing restraint and allowing markets to adapt instead of throwing its weight around.
Bitcoin, today, is also not a very big threat to the government.  It's 1.5% of GDP.  2% of total stock market cap.  Its still tiny in the grand scheme of things.  If tax evasion or money laundering or whatever does become a real issue then we'll start seeing some power being thrown around.

Bcash is a fork, technically an altcoin but using the same design so virtually identical "tech".

Namecoin is not a fork in the common usage meaning for crypto.   The code is forked and the network is forked but the block chain is not kept, meaning its a cloned coin. A fork is when the existing bitcoin block chain is kept while the code base and network are forked.  
The anti-fork sentiment is funny to me because everyone who owns bitcoin also owns bitcoin cash. It'd be extremely easy to kill bcash if every bitcoin backer sold their bcash which would crash the price and virtually kill the coin. 
This hasn't happened for only 2 reasons I can think of.  1) BTC owners are ignorant of the fact that they own bcash because they don't understand forks and this don't sell.  2) BTC owners keep bcash as a hedge incase it succeeds.
