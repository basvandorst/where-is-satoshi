Big. 140 x 70 cm (~27.5 x 55 inches). I had been looking for that too. It's at the bottom of the listing.

20 bids already, damn! There's still a lot of time in the auction. Also, the painting is a bit of a mind fuck. I get why people are into it. I think I see me sitting at the table!

I've been thinking about this for three hours now. We know there are 12 disciples, and we know from the blog that it's a mixture of real people and archetypes who are a part of the bitcoin community. So... here's my best attempt left to right: 
1. Scientist
2. Burts Bees kid (is that the right name?... the kids who sold honey for bitcoin early on)
3. Grandmother
4. Mark Karpelis
5. Satoshi?? Nakamoto??
6. ?
BLOCKCHAIN JESUS
7. ?
8. looks like the founder of Satoshi's Dice, no?
9. Anonymous
10. Beggar (we've got a lot of those!)
11. Artist (perhaps the artist of the painting? looks like the unfinished painting on his easel) 
12. Gambler....? 
PS I'll make edits if you guys can help me out. 
EDIT: Updated based on geckofawkes reply!

Glad to see the painting getting a bunch of recognition, and also to see that Project Bitcoin will be able to talk a big next step. Great painting, great project, well deserved all around the horn!

A few months ago I tried to make an eBay listing. The word "bitcoin" isn't allowed unless you post to their classified ads section for virtual currency (you can't make a real virtual currency auction. It must be an ad). I guess he found a rather low-tech work around. 
Oddly, eBay does allow "payment at pickup" - which is what this guy is doing, and could be in bitcoin. The problem with ebay comes with selling virtual currency on the site. He's selling a painting, so as far as I know, it should be fine.  ** Disclaimer: I'm no expert so don't take my word as gold. But I wanted to sell some mining equipment for bitcoin on eBay and talked to their customer service a few times before opting for a quick ad.

Nice! Huge help to have the originals. I'm such an idiot for misplacing Judas/Mark. I should be able to notice his smug face from afar. 
I will update my list based on yours...

Looks like it was a good idea so far - a lot of attention and bids, perhaps because of a format people feel comfortable with. Also, he's still selling only in bitcoin - makes that clear in the description of the auction. 
Also, I read through every single blog entry yesterday and today, as I'm now fascinated. It looks like the project got hit hard by the dude with the statue who tried to rip him off, and then likely by the Mt. Gox stuff, etc. Perhaps this will be a good step in getting it back on the right track.
