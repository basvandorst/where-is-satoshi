memorizing it is a bad idea.... memories fade and distort over time too.

many copiers are connected to networks and some even store images of every piece of paper they have scanned. I'm sure right now there are automated scripts probing every copier and printer node with a table of default passwords and checking for accessible local storage.

there are places where you can paste the transaction id and generous mining pools will attempt to accelerate the tx. not sure where they are buy i used one once and it worked. 
google or reddit search bitcoin transaction accelerator or something

Some people are corporate interests, whales already have enough influence on the price, now they get to control the technology too? Pass. Tbh im not even sure this isn't already the case.
You are right though, a bunch of morons arguing is pretty toxic...

You will never see the bitcoin again, even if it happened yesterday -- once it is gone, it is gone for good!
sorry :/

wouldnt your identity be tied to the exchange account. Poloniex requires photo id uploading and more.

@_date: 2017-10-25 21:29:09
Export public and private keys from your wallet, save securely.
Then send all BTC to a new wallet.
You will use your old private keys to access BTG
This kills the replay attack

I want a consensus that can't be purchased. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:20:44
What's your point. I'd still take a regular puppy over an Animatronic Disney Goldman Sachs R tm Puppy2x 
Edit: thought you said puppy, I'm leaving it

A family memeber just graduated from ucsd medical and stayed in the ucsd medical system, can confirm there are crazy motherfuckers who do awesome shit like this that actually exist. Could be fake, but so can everything, i believe him.
