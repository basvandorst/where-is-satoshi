I wonder if they will hold bitcoins or sell them immediately?
Does anyone know what reddit's policy on this is?

If I were the owners I'd hold I mean reddit is massively profitable already why not keep the bitcoin and hope it keeps rising?

I really can't wait to see what happens with the price, of course I don't want to see anyone really financially hurt by their decisions with bitcoin but it will be interesting when it either goes to $100/btc or $1/btc. 
As someone with btc 0.0005 I can't imagine how nervous/excited I'd be if I had a large amount of btc.

6 Michael Clear, top CS student in Trinity Collge Dublin?
Then he's not UK based, Dublin is in the republic of Ireland not the UK!!!
EDIT: On further examination I assume Mr. Clear studied at Trinity but is now UK based, sorry for my gaelic rage!

The way I see it bitcoin is striving to be a free currency, uncontrolled by any government and their perception of whats right or wrong.
Of course I dont want to see it becoming a tool of terrorism or organised crime so bitcoiners will have to use their own moral compass when it comes to bitcoins application. I personally don't have a problem with drugs and silk road has been a major factor in the early succes of bitcoin.
