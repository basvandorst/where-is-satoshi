But they’ll burn the place down if it drops because coiners are rage monsters

You also run the risk of noobs being regulars and flipping their shit every day they come in and bugging the shit out of you

At their current price points, you would’ve been made a lot more money investing in amazon 5 years ago than bitcoin 5 years ago...

It is cherry picked, but it’s just an observation that I thought was interesting. I’m not trying to make any implications like BiTcoiN iS uSEleSs or anything, it was just odd to see when I looked at the charts today, hence a post in the DAILY  discussion about the DAILY price point and not an actual post about how I think stocks are better than bitcoin.

I know, it’s just weird to see because almost anyone you asked would think the person who bought into bitcoin that long ago would be loaded and have seen much higher gains than someone who bought a high-profile stock. I am well aware the observation is a little misleading, it’s just odd to see.

If the same person bought bitcoin and amazon on this exact day 5 years ago, then yes you would

Would bcash be a good buy right now? Seems like it has more room to grow percentage-wise.

Jesus this is cringey
