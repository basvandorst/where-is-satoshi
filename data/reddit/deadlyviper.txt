You should probably add more information about the payment method, and the rough estimate of the btc amount you want to buy.

They'd probably take away the coins rather than try charging again.

You are looking at the current status, without looking into why it happens and what can change in the future.
Currently most exchanges/places for people to step into cryptocurrency world is via bitcoin, you can't buy crapcoin without going through bitcoin first. This is why they are so linked.
But in the future, some new redditcoin could take over, and allow easy fiat purchase, and be traded everywhere, and be accepted everywhere, and have flat transaction fees, and almost instantaneous transactions, and bitcoin will die.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:14:22
Your transaction seems to be 10 sat/byte, and have an invalid destination address.
Looking at the link you provided the destination address is "bc1qhqdlanru2plh8kplpevxcpn3crjfylk7jt7p0e" ... which doesnt seem to be any type of address i know of.

Option 2 is safer.


They'd have to find a way to be activated on the linux live cd system. Just a file on the USB isn't enough to run and do malicious stuff. 
Assuming the downloaded zip isn't the infection source in the first place btw.
And if you also unplug the computer from the internet before running linux live cd, and don't replug it back until you are done and powered off, then the malware would also have to find a way to transmit the stolen data cross operating systems, which is not easy.

Fee is still a bit low, and it has lots of inputs, it should be confirmed in another day i think.
The way to accelerate it was to make the same order but with a lot more fees, if it was urgent you should have place around 150 sat/byte or 200, i didn't check mempool in a while.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:28:05
did someone just add ~5k 2-5 sat transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:43:44
You are probably missing the fact that the fees are affected by user demand.
And as such it confirms to Supply/Demand graphs, which are not linear.
As the demand grows, it deviates to higher curve than it would otherwise do if it were linear increase.
So the assumption that at 1.6x the traffic you should have 1.6x the fees, is wrong.

Very Different from:


@_date: 2018-01-22 11:18:53
because cheaper coins could be cheaper because they are not yet known/accessible enough for everyone, so they are undervalued, so they are more likely to rise in price.
Because its more likely a coin starting today that is worth 0.01$ will be 0.1$ in a week, but less likely that bitcoin will be 120,000$ in a week.
One giving you x10 profit, while the other is stagnant at his current price.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:55:51
If its an exchange, some exchanges have shit fees.
You can take a look at the transaction information on the exchange, and if that is not provided, you can check out the incoming transaction on the destination wallet address.
Look up destination wallet address at blockchain.info, find the unconfirmed transaction, look at it's fee.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:19:42
I think it will either run out of bitcoins earlier then 2140.
Or if the reward rate is adjusted then it will have to be a lot less than it is now.

How exactly making an exchange decentralized help avoid anyone, with influence or foreknowledge of something, from selling all his crypto prior to some market changing news?
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:08:05
Because exchanges don't move bitcoins on the blockchain as long as the money is within the exchange.
If you want to withdraw it, then they create a transaction and then it will take time.

The simple answer is Transaction fees.
Miners also get paid from the transaction fees of the transactions they put in the blocks.

It is problematic yes, but when transaction rate is limited you have to decide how you handle the queue.
Its either regular queue, where everyone is equal, then you hurt everyone equally.
Or its a priority queue, where people who can afford it, have it easier. Its not new, it won't be the downfall, much like medical queue does not crash hospitals. (since the more severe case has priority over a lighter case, so the lightly injured suffer longer)
It may turn bitcoin into a "rich kids" currency.

Mining isn't an accurate science, it's based on guessing the correct answer to a math problem the computer can't otherwise solve.
The mining speed is how many guesses it can try per second, the more you try, the higher the chance you will hit an answer.
My guess the estimation in nice hash is also based on your fluctuating hash rate, since you also use your computer, it mines faster or slower accordingly.

Probably the transfer delay of the bitcoins.
Coupled with the 552 Euros difference, is that if you buy a full bitcoin!
if you buy 0.01, that's 5 Euros instead, assuming rate does not change while the bitcoins are in transit.
EDIT: also is the difference between a "rate" and a "rate" or a sell order on one and a buy order on the other? this will also decrease the gap.

Through extensive analysis of a narrow data sample of Bitcoin transactions between 2013 and 2016, this study

 The parameters of the study were purposefully narrow to keep the data manageable, which likely

People "losing" their bitcoin means they lose their cryptographic key, and can no longer control the wallet.
If the private key is lost, the money just stays there without anyone able to use it.
And the 12 words recovery, is used for a technique allowing the program to recreate the private key based on these 12 words, anyone who has the 12 words is pretty much equal to having the private key = has control of the specific address with bitcoins there.

I'm not sure of a site that could give such information, but given programming knowledge the blockchain could be explored to find this exact condition.
But you are going to find the address, not the private key, i'm not sure how this will help the owner, since he probably lost the private key and not the wallet address.

Move your coin to an exchange, for example gdax, i think coinbase and gdax are the same thing btw, so it should be free.
And when the money is in the exchange's account, there is no actual on-chain transactions when trading, only when depositing or withdrawing, so its instant, and the trade fee is what the exchange decides, usually between 0.1% and 0.25%.

It depends on each country's law and regulations.

I guess its because some people can't order a hardware wallet, due to it not being delivered to where they live.

* Same for several other coins
* Same for half the other coins
* Far from smart scaling, the coin scales poorly.
* 9 years of trust - falls exactly into "the original one" reason.
* Network effect &amp; brand name - falls exactly into "the original one" reason.
There is no real technical advantage to bitcoin over half the other coins, especially since it came first and struggles to keep up with the demand and the changes required of it.

Every transaction has a fee attached to it, each transaction takes a certain amount of bytes.
Miners are going to take the most lucrative transactions first: the ones that have highest fees compared to transaction size.
You can see the unconfirmed transactions, and the breakdown based on sat/byte (fee/byte) 
Depending on your fee, you can guestimate when and if the transaction will be confirmed.
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:52:09
If the transaction is recorded and you can view it on blockchain.info or any other block chain explorer sites.
Then just wait for it to be confirmend and it should appear at its destination.
If the transaction doesnt appear to exist, then restart/resync whatever wallet/thing you used to send the transaction, and it should have the money back in the original address.

Transactions are fully traceable all the way back to the original address that mined them.


All transactions are public, all wallet's addresses can be seen and the amount of currency in them.


That's the current reward, it will get lower in the future, and it was higher in the past.


Every block can house a lot of transactions, and you mine it by solving a hard math problem, then you can fill the block with pending transactions, submitting it to the network, and therefore making the transactions verified, collecting the reward for mining the block (12.5 today) and collecting the reward from transaction fees that you managed to include in the block.


Each bitcoin comes from some wallet address via a transaction, and if that address does not contain the required balance, the transaction will not get verified by the bitcoin network, and will not occur.

Yes its not useful if you are a bot looking for keywords.

So an exchange, that can basically do whatever it wants with fake orders of BTC that are not backed by real people or real money or real anything, invented USDT so they can fake buys?
why? why not fake buy to raise price without inventing a currency for it?
If bitfinex wanted to inflate price and put itself at risk, it could just do that.

You get refunded the amount you paid, not the amount you would have had had you not paid and held onto your cash.

You mined 0.0032 BTC on your PHONE?
This seems extremely unlikely, how long did it take? which app?
If its real and you can withdraw it, its currently worth ~36 USD.
The app in question should allow you to withdraw the bitcoins, into an address you provide.
The address you get from a wallet/exchange. Coinbase people usually hate, but its the popular one.
Edit: the most likely case is that you installed malware on your phone, that disguises itself as a bitcoin miner, while stealing passwords/funds/other stuff from your phone.

1. Did you also walk into a place where "profesionals" hang out and hear them not talk about bitcoin?
2. if there are only 2 parts, then they are either equal one to the other, or one is larger then the other, they can't be both "large parts", because the other part becomes "small part" of the market.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:53:36


An assumption on your side, do you have stats backing this?


How many large parts are there? is the amateur part larger then the professional part?
Who controls the other parts(non-pro/amateur), since between amateurs and professionals there is no more types of people, and they can't both be controlling a "large part" of the market without there being a third group at least that controls less then each of the "large" groups.

4 People:
1. Touches 1 time per minute
2. Touches 1 time per minute
3. Touches 60 times per minute
4. Touches 200 times per minute
The average is (1 + 1 + 60 + 200) / 4 = 65.5 times per minute.
Now if you take a look you'll notice that 75% of the people are below the average. ( Person 1, 2 and 3 )
And only 25% are above the average. (Person 4)
So no, an average does not imply the amount of people above it or below it.

Yes they do, because they know they can make a higher gain from it's return.
Buy at 5k, sell at 4k, you lost 1k oh NOES.
It goes on to 3k, you buy there, it raises to 5k, you got 2k, YAY. (1k profit in total)

Withdrawal happens in two stages.
Stage 1 the exchange creates the transaction on the blockchain.
That's what binance told you is completed.
Stage 2 the blockchain transaction gets confirmed by the network, this depends on the fee, and the network load, usually binance's fees get picked up in an hour or two.
