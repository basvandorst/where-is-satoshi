Segwit is a prerequisite to the Lightning Network.  I'd call it a stepping stone.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:10:41
$0 fees for buying?  Count me in!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:06:06
200k+ unconfirmed transactions right now.  Yeah, you'll be waiting a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:43:21
This is like a dickless rollercoaster.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:28:42
The trick would just be to handle the load without breaking a sweat instead of censorship. That would deter anyone trying this in the first place. Bitcoin should be able to handle dust transactions in the future because of layered solutions like LN.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:46:04
So you hopped on the Bitcoin rollercoaster instead?
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:02:29
Yeah agreed I realized that after I wrote it tbh. Good call.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:19:47
Holy shit... Lol they have no idea what they are talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:14:48
Same, I've never heard of CoinGate.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:10:36
Definitely going to eat his dick at this pace.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:22:33
I was surprised how upbeat they kept it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:35:54
RemindMe! 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:19
Ahhh good call. Yeah his dick might be safe then. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:24
You must have broke it.
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:47:35
SEC probably had a inside stake of the Hashlets.

Breath easy everyone, we have been saved!
@_date: 2015-06-12 00:18:21
"We cannot comment on the ETF."
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:54:01
The ability to make a transaction happen in the futureeeeee.
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:06:56
Sounds like a good time to be a miner and collect on them fees then...
@_date: 2015-06-12 00:34:19
No, I totally understand why they can't.  It's just a little disappointing after such a long process they can't even talk about it.
@_date: 2015-12-16 14:13:22
Don't port-forward your way out of your network.
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:58:00
Does Shapeshift have an onion address?  That would be awesome.
@_date: 2015-06-27 00:45:45
Card. Lol
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:24:50
If I had stupid amounts of throwaway money I would do the same exact thing.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:26:06
As someone who runs 3 full nodes, increasing the space required to store the blockchain doesn't matter to me.  I'd still be running the Bitcoin client on my file servers regardless of their size.  Hard drives keep getting bigger, bandwidth keeps getting more abundant, etc.
@_date: 2015-06-23 01:53:27
Mmmmm gotta love some fees.  :)
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:44:10
I was just about to comment on this part of the text.  Love seeing this!
@_date: 2015-06-25 12:35:46
Of course, we have over there spreading some FUD.  Good to see some things never change.
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:56:03
I doubt they would release this huge of news on a Thursday / end of the week.
The news cycles like to flush and reset on Mondays.
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:37:47
Wow, 25!  Nice!  Keep it up.  I only have my 3 full nodes on separate fiber connections.  Gotta keep spreading the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:15:20
Completed!  500 bits @_date: 2014-06-13 16:59:34
Sounds like time for Plan B.  :)
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:16:36
If they were honest and transparent, they wouldn't be going bankrupt in the first place.  :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:44:18
Nothing a little time and software can't solve.  This is why I'm in BTC for the long haul.
People use lights and electricity today without even thinking about it.  I plug things in and just expect it to work without thinking twice about how the electricity has to be converted and controlled before reaching my devices.
People use their browsers all day without having to think about how HTTP works as well.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:20:07
The comments sections on every mainstream media website are a battle ground right now.  So much hate and FUD. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 12:45:44
I wouldn't say ears.....
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:34:00
Again, China bans something Bitcoin every single week.  I'm over China.  I'm banning them from my life.
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:09:35
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:57:46
Same here.  Love it, although it needs an update to the latest iOS features.
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:54:39
If I could make it through a single day without reading a "mainstream" news article about Bitcoin without it mentioning god damn silk road that would be beautiful.
I didn't even know silk road existed before it was shut down.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:16:58
I use Wells Fargo for my transactions with Coinbase.  Haven't had any problems yet.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:50:24
You realize "a few years ago" means nothing.  The currency itself is 5 years old.  Coinbase and Blockchain.info have about 2 million wallets combined.  That's nothing in the grand scheme of things.  We are still very early in terms of adoption.
@_date: 2014-10-20 12:57:00


They seriously keep coming back to this?  How many USD per day is involved in "illegal" transactions and is never brought up?  
Get your shit together Thiel.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:44:57
Thanks @_date: 2014-08-24 03:10:40
Cool! I'll update my seeds when I get home. The last I checked my bootstrap upload count was over 500 GB.
Anything to help out the network!
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:45:16
Someone should make a BRD/USD ticket.
10 bits for the idea @_date: 2014-03-27 13:04:26
I gave you an upvote to make up for it.  :)
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:09:09
Yeah, he has no idea.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:44:19
I wonder if they are going to hold it at all.  That would be a game changer.  If they just flip it for USD at PoS (which is still nice) I don't think it is as big.
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:46:50
Yup, count me as one of them.  I'm about to go home and make myself a proxy out of my Raspberry Pi.
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:17:06
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:28:16
Was scrolling just to find a post like this.
@_date: 2014-10-22 12:28:00
If you are a merchant who pays credit card fees, why *not* accept Bitcoin?  Even if you convert it back to fiat at the point-of-sale.  If people are willing to buy items from you, why deny them that?
Good work OP!
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:06:25
Exactly, how do you comment on something without at least Googling things you are confused about, and especially on national TV.  No credibility.
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:36:00
100 bits @_date: 2014-05-22 16:55:33
Bitcoin is really going to give them...
The D.

The proof of burn already happened I'm pretty sure...
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:13:39
I'm still getting the, "Wait, Bitcoin didn't go under in February?", line.
@_date: 2014-08-12 19:45:14
I was going to ask this just for the lolz.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:12:26
Too soon?
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:30:49
@_date: 2014-08-20 02:54:27
This sounds like a great idea!  I was just about to make a thread on this myself.  Maybe one of them could organize a group donation in Bitcoin as well...
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:00:42
Uh oh, Yahoo article.  Brace yourselves, misinformed comments in the comments-section incoming!
@_date: 2014-08-25 01:23:29
What a garbage Op-Ed.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:28:28
Definitely going to setup a Tor proxy when I get home tonight.
@_date: 2014-06-26 04:32:19
Honestly, from watching her talk about BTC over the last year, I think she is forced to play devil's advocate.
@_date: 2014-07-18 06:47:48
Yeah, I'm not buying into any of these regulations. Good luck with that one....
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:33:04
The comments sections on these articles are just..... ugh.
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:08:25
Congrats!  0.5848 bits @_date: 2014-06-26 04:31:54
I f'ing loved this clip.  My body is ready, Wall Street.
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:04:07
Exactly.  I have no doubt people won't give a shit out this.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:00:59
That's how that works, right?
@_date: 2014-12-10 12:15:54
What the fuck did I just watch?
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:52:50
Will the Gox'ing ever sto.... oh wait.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:06:45
blah blah... tulips... blah blah... money laundering...blah blah blah
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:05:28
Might as well just ban the Internet. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:46:49
This would be absolutely huge for BTC I think.
Thanks for the link OP!
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:10:22
Awesome script, will be implementing this tonight on my nodes.
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:28:44
Fortunately, a lot of websites hopped on the issue and fixed it within hours of the announcement of the bug. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:08:47
Are you saying its available on Disqus now??? 
Thanks for the bits!  I'll pay it forward.  :)
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:00:51
You essentially said the equivalent of:
"I don't need numbers, just go around the street corner and talk to my dealer Joe."
Joe only accepts USD.
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:26:06
I remember playing with rocks and sticks.
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:16:44
Yeah, I mean, honestly if you already work for a big credit card you probably have to have some basic understanding of money and transactions anyway.  They are just putting up a front to push the public in a certain direction.
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:17:53
Both BitPay and Coinbase are doing huge things in this space.  They deserve a lot of credit.
@_date: 2014-09-05 16:05:29
It's sad really.  I've tried explaining to people at work why these breaches are bad and they say "I can just go on my card account online and mark any payment as fraudulent and they refund me. Easy."
SMH -- that's not the way to look at it.  As a Computer Scientist and a Bitcoiner, this outlook on finances needs to change.
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:30:44
Yeah, when they said iCloud I cringed a little bit too.  Good thing they found Satoshi to clear that whole thing up though.
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:06:37
Exactly. Just because they aren't secure online doesn't mean we aren't.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:11:09
These are the kinds of articles and opinions that are needed.  Each of us that sees the potential in Bitcoin needs to spread the word and decrease the amount of FUD going on for the future of money and the digital economy.
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:47:53
"Schemes" lol
@_date: 2014-12-21 18:35:26
Thanks for your contribution! Will add your address to my full nodes.
@_date: 2014-11-24 04:18:36
Added your IP to my full node.  :)
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:34:59
Wish I could add a public key just to watch.  That would be the best.
@_date: 2014-10-31 12:47:45
This is why if I were to buy gold, I'd buy the real thing and hold it in my own private safe rather than a share of a gold ETF or something.
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:05:01
However, that would never make the news because that's the world we live in.
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:37:46
Well, you should adjust that for inflation....
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:42:23
That'd be cool too!
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:20:29
As someone in the game a long time, couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:23:30
2 bits for your 2 nodes @_date: 2014-03-02 01:01:06
I'm in the same boat.  Most of my friends have the same viewpoint.
Granted, these same friends are not good at investing and have little to no investment experience.  This might tie into their understanding of BTC as well.
@_date: 2014-04-05 02:14:11
40% projected inflation in 2014 for the Argentine Peso.  It's time for plan B.  :)
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:12:19
They disabled comments for the video because we'd tear that video to shreds.

@_date: 2014-07-02 15:58:02
Sometimes they are good for a laugh.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:07:24
Because, you know, all that illegal activity won't happen now that Bitcoin is banned.  
@_date: 2014-12-21 05:51:38
Yeah this is why I'm not too worried about bitcoin's adoption. Just being at home with technologically illiterate family members over the holidays reminds me how far technology has yet to go in the eyes of the public as a whole not just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:36:15
+1 for Socom 2 reference.  I loved that game.  So many thousands of hours.

@_date: 2014-12-08 13:41:59
The Bitcoin Bowl really brings the topic up to the mainstream.  My office is like 99% 20-30 year old males who are all into College Football so it is pretty funny to hear them all talking about "What is this Bitcoin Bowl thing?"
I'm determined to answer their questions if they have any but mostly it is just chuckling about the name of the bowl game.
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:33:59
Good thing I sanitize all of my fiat before touching it.
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:09:45

Yeah same. It's such a huge technical topic that I feel like a huge nerd explaining any of it. Saved OP's link for later reference.

It still gets me every day.  This subreddit calls to me.

Wow... seriously?  Ughhhhhhhhhh.
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:21:00
Wow, didn't even know services like BetaRigs existed.  Totally going to list my rigs there for people to take advantage of.  Thanks OP!

Note: A deflationary fiat currency is NOT desirable.  In this case, a deflationary currency is desired.
@_date: 2014-10-31 12:53:40
Isn't this how companies like Bitpay handle the transfer between BTC and fiat?  They just accept it and flip it if I'm not mistaken.
The merchants may not go to their own exchanges, Bitpay does it for them.
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:58:54
Wow, that's an ominous article.

Can you imagine slipping a Bitcoin symbol into a Super Bowl Budweiser commercial?  That would be awesome.
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:46:24
Same here.  I was near the top in Folding points on the worldwide leaderboard when I first heard of Bitcoin in 2010 but I shook it off because I didn't understand it.

If Apple dropped technology I don't think I would mind...  ;)

This happens to me a lot now, between myself and the few buddies that own BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:37:42
I'm guessing by the name, they are using parts of the Apple Airplay/Airdrop API's to do the device pairing.  It's not impossible for this to happen on Android/Windows phone, I just don't know if the abstraction layer is fleshed out enough yet.
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:22:35
Currently, I have 3 full nodes running.  2 physical boxes and 1 VPS.
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:58:37
The iOS app has nothing about Bitcoin yet.  Just opened it up, latest version.
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:26:10
I hardly bring the topic up anymore in conversation.  The only time I talk to another person about it IRL is when they ask me "Why is Bitcoin down so much???????" and it gets exhausting trying to defend it.
I'm still all in on the technology but I still think we haven't hit that public adoption niche that will drive us to the next level.
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:46:33
Holy satoshi!  This is big!

Good point, empty the vaults!

We'll see who wins out in the end.  Here's to never buying another Apple product again.

Yeah, I got a little nervous when I wasn't able to edit it.  Glad to see they are releasing an edit tool soon.

Take my upvotes.

Great idea!  Reward first adopters and draw in the rest of the onlookers in the process.

You need to have a Visa credit card to enable instant transfers.  Visa debit cards do not work for this.  I don't have a Visa credit card, so I cannot enable instant transactions.

Two of my favorite things -- Bitcoin and The Matrix.  And the analogies between the two things are similar.  Love it.
As far as what the OP said, this is the same mentality that myself and all of my friends that are buying/holding BTC are using.  Buy and hold, profit in the way long run.

Exactly, just move pools.  Ghash isn't necessarily doing anything wrong.  They just happen to have one of the best business models and admin interfaces for mining pools.
Just hop to another pool...

I've heard this argument plenty of times, yet no one has just rolled their own "coin" and tried to demonstrate it.
Unless they can prove their arguments in code, I don't want to hear about it.

I agree, the underlying framework is there, but we still need layers and layers of abstraction before it can be ready for that type of public acceptance.
The day that my Mom comes up to me and asks me about Bitcoin will be the day they should start accepting BTC.

The thing they are forgetting about is off-chain transactions.  If Coinbase/Bitpay would release their transaction numbers per day I think we would probably hear a different story.

Exactly.  Good luck tracking down those transactions.

Honestly, this is what draws me to them.  I'd love to mine on a "smaller" pool, but their admin interface and the auto-splitting of payouts to multiple addresses is awesome.
EDIT: My failover pools are BitMinter and Eligius.

I wouldn't say that I'm constantly having "to answer for" the daily happenings of the BTC world to my friends but I would say it is almost weekly the topics come up.
It is really hard to defend a topic that these people are so skeptical of in the first place then the mainstream media blows way out of proportion.

You cannot guarantee it without having a centralized entity behind it backing it up.  However, for a decentralized network it is sure holding the peg well.

Crazy what can happen when you trust third parties with your funds.  Use multi-sig people, keep your keys offline for your large amounts.  Use hot/cold (checking/savings) models, etc.

Sarcasm detector, activate! 100 bits @_date: 2015-03-16 15:34:25
More and more integration!  Good work!

If only there were some sort of ledger that was publicly available...
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:01:44
Yeah I believe on the RES Website you'll find a section about it being a premium feature.
@_date: 2015-03-06 13:40:17
Wait, you can actually do that?  Holy crap I need this...
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:30:28
It's pretty cheap and uses barely any power.  I'd say if you aren't already running a full node you should.  :)  (I am running three of my own.  Separate networks, separate connections)
@_date: 2015-11-19 14:13:10
Yeah nothing to see here......
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:01:56
Snowden was a big reason I run my own Tor-relay node and BTC nodes.  Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:23:02


Oh no, 3%.  Watch out.
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:27:52
It works!  Just got $5 free.
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:41:25
With the word centralized, you don't need proof of anything.  All you need is a SQL database and some CRUD.
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:12:27
Always protect your ports.  ;)
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:36:29
20% more for using Bitcoin.  Nice incentive!
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:32:09
I am going to assume that auto-prune is going to be in future versions of Bitcoin.  That 160GB HDD should last until then.
Auto-updating isn't that big of a deal.  I'm sure there is a bash script that someone wrote that will go and download/compile the latest version of bitcoind for you.  You won't *need* to upgrade unless there is a hard fork either.
@_date: 2015-03-20 13:50:51
Can't wait to try this out after work!
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:25:20
I'm personally running three separate full nodes on three separate fiber connections.  I am already running these servers for file backup and storage, PLEX, etc.  This is just another service running on them.  I'm happy to help out the network and keep it going.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:36:46
~132 mBTC.
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:08:41
They *are* [currencies]( though.  


Just because they are denominated in dollars doesn't mean that they aren't traded between users.  People trade airlines miles, WoW gold, etc. every single day.  Again, the poll said that Americans wouldn't use alternative currencies.  My point is that, they are.
Bitcoin is denominated in USD right now as well.  Just because it isn't pegged to a $ value doesn't invalidate my argument against the stupid survey percentage.
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:45:42
I check the Bitcoin news *a lot* and I've never even heard of MyCoin.
Anyways, any institution that offers that big of a return is an obvious scam.  This isn't tied to Bitcoin, this is just tied to stupidity.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:00:31
My full node did 102GB upload last week.
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:55:55
Since the release of 0.10.0 last week (Monday), my full node has uploaded over 100+ GB.  I love Headers First.  :)
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:47:34
Love the graphic that says "79% of Americans wouldn't use an alternate currency."
Little do most Americans know, but they are using digital currencies all of the time.  Gift cards, reward points, Microsoft points, in-game currencies, etc, etc, etc.
Maybe 79% of the older generation, but I think people who have grown up in the digital age won't be so hard to move to an all-digital money.
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:07:42


@_date: 2015-02-03 04:06:11
I can't really tell if you are being sarcastic, I mean, I hope you aren't.  :)  I think it'll be easier once bits are the main unit.
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:43:37
Probably a 160GB HDD should be fine, and cheap.
I wouldn't set and *totally* forget though, there may be a hard fork coming up here soon to support bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:56:33
However, OpenGL and Apple are still around...  and Apple is now one of the most profitable companies in the world.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:02:07
Thanks!  Updated my 3 full nodes!
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:01:41
Good.  Gooooooooood.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:22:48
Good thing we aren't forced to use Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:53:12
Well, my XCP balance is 0 on there, so that's cool.
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:55:05
He apparently doesn't understand counter party risk.  To have "backing", there must be a "backer".  That's impossible in a decentralized fashion.

This website tracks the current status of all full-nodes on the network:

If only there were some way to transfer funds electronically and securely, instantly!

@_date: 2015-02-25 16:29:56
Going to need my bucket of popcorn for the next 10 years for sure.
Can't wait to see what happens when Central Banks start "issuing" digital currencies and people are getting their funds seized left and right.  All this will allow for is the "ease" for TPTB to get what they want.
@_date: 2015-02-27 04:06:31
This guy is an absolute beast.
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:47:10
In this same amount of time, my number of nodes has grown 300%.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:38:33
Nice!  Where'd you snag that kind of upload connection?  And what kind of hardware are you running.
My three nodes are each on 60+ Mbps upload connections.  Two of the nodes are HP N54L's and one is a Azure cloud box.
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:24:12
This is huge!
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:09:44
Not sure, sorry. My nodes are all windows based. :(
@_date: 2015-03-12 14:37:00
What's with the recent China news lately?
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:22:21
Wow, absolute stupidity.
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:56:37
Matt Miller has really came a long way since the 12 Days of Bitcoin piece he did last year.  Good for him.
@_date: 2015-02-09 04:20:08
Almost like standing behind the person in line at the grocery store writing out a personal check and taking their sweet time about it. 
Edit: I probably got downvoted by the old-lady in front of me I'm talking shit about.
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:03:49
Can't wait until people stop referencing that all-time high and start recognizing the price was artificially manipulated by a lack of legitimate exchanges and a bot in a sandbox.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:34:03
So you are the one using all of my bandwidth.  :)
I upgraded my full nodes on Monday right after the release, and since then I've uploaded over 35GB from one node alone.  (I have 3 full nodes running.)
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:20:08
I could guarantee if god damn CNN wanted to interview me for national TV I'd at least want to know what I'm talking about before making an ass of myself.

Wow this is awesome.  I was really hoping that it would integrate right into the Windows Explorer.  Keep up the great work!

Guys, guys... Just give trickle down economics a chance. I mean, it can't take that much longer right?

Good!  More competition in the space drives innovation forward and prices lower for everyone.  (Hopefully).
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:50:58
That wasn't my point.  I was just touching on the fact that these supposed Americans wouldn't use any alternative currency.  Good try though.
@_date: 2015-02-26 23:20:02
I mean, honestly, ever since I've been into Bitcoin I've become hyper-aware of every single user account and password I use and have 2FA enabled on every service that allows it.
Hard to see why a person with access to that much capital would be so careless.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:30:10
3 full nodes on 3 separate fiber connections.  Helps out the network!
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:20:48
That's totally fine for their books.  If I send you 40,000 WoW gold, that doesn't mean I'm sending you dollars.

Finite number of Bitcoins, infinite number of hookers.  This checks out.

Yes we do! Start your own.

Per the comments section, why does everyone assume that Bitcoin is about "making money"?  I just don't get it.  I'm enthralled by the technology and what it could possibly bring to the payments industry as well as make the world a better place by the blockchain transparency.  
People seem to get so hung up that you can't mine it at a profit anymore and just completely dismiss it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:09:56
Just downloaded and tried it out.  Cool idea!  Makes keeping track of BTC purchases pretty simple.

Mind. Blown.

Thanks for pointing this out!  Currently seeding on my 10MB/s fiber.  :)  Anything to help out the spread of BTC.

Funny, whenever I buy or sell it does the same thing.

I want to see a way for people to invest into BTC straight from the NYSE (and other markets).  "Big-time" investors aren't going to go on CoinBase and buy 10 BTC at a time.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:41:03
After watching the 12 days of Bitcoin, I'm very impressed with Matt's transformation into a "believer".  It's been fun to watch.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:18:10
Updated both of my full nodes to 0.8.6.  Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:16:10
Can someone print out a QR code and "demo" transferring BTC?  Just put it on the TV screen and we can all send money.  Then donate it to charity.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:19:13
This is awesome, I made a few paper wallets to give out but not nearly this many.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:07:31
I'm running two full nodes (with both BTC-qt and LTC-qt apps), both on separate &gt;40 Mbps upload fiber connections.

QR codes tattooed on the strippers, obviously.
