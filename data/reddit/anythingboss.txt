Yup, down from an all time high during 2007-2008. Unlike crypto, the money “invested” in a chance to become rich in a casino is one time only, once you’re out o cash you’re done... Point was that people went to Vegas during the crisis to get rich. Once it didn’t pay off the and the punters were out of money, the stock crashed.
With crypto, if money flees in, you don’t lose it. Instead you retain a digital asset.

Just to add in on the “stability in a crisis”: check out MGM (the Vegas casinos)’s share price during the crisis in 07/08. It doubled.

Well, it depends on whether you are buying it in whole $1 or £1 or (insert fiat here) or 100s of little shards of fiat.......
