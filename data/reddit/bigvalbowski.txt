I have no intention of cashing out for few years... but at the same time I can't help myself but keep checking every few hours. Madness.

I did have some on GDAX but I took off and placed on my Trezor. Probably just as well.

Agreed. Governments need to get behind crypto. They’ll want their piece of the pie so to speak, but at the same time they won’t be able to affect it through traditional means. If it’s recognised and taxed on gains then it’s a good thing and further legitimises it.

I'm in the UK. It's all pretty wishy-washy at the moment over here. No doubt that will soon change.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:39
Well it's not being bought on coinbase. I can't see how this isn't a pump and dump. No other rational explanation for it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:45:01
I'm committed to wait until we hit 1 million. That is all.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:28
GDAX. You can still see it. Wish I'd had a buy order in place now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:31
Sorry, in UK. Just dropped from £12k to £7k and back up again. Someone got that buy.

OP is not a smart man Lieutenant Dan!
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:29:58
Done and done.

I just read about that too. Will be interesting to see what they come up with.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:23:05
It honestly sounds like he's going to make things worse for himself. Now he's not branding it as an alternative but as the same thing. So if someone genuinely wanted to buy BCash over Bitcoin they're not going to know the difference.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:03:33
Totally guessing, but is there any chance that the missing Bitcoins from Nicehash found themselves being sent to Andreas? Timing was funny. In no way am insinuating Andreas had anything to do with that btw.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:11:11
Probably setup as a sell order. 
It’s 1am in the uk. I fully expect to wake up and see everything return to normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:25:03
Great thing about the British ‘walls’ is there’s no big drop off when one of them hits. I still think £12k by Xmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:40:00
Fucks sake. I bought in at beginning of Nov at an ATH. Down, Up, Down, Up, Down.... and I'm up 50% already.
Nothing but FUD on here right now. In just a couple of years the regret of non HOLDers will be mind blowing.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:36:27
I can't do it but someone should meme the fuck out of the "That's not a knife" scene from Crocodile Dundee.

This could potentially end up having the opposite effect when CNBC eventually realises the mistake they’ve made (and they will) and refer to it as a clone. 
At least other altcoins don’t try and trade off the name.

It’s getting big when the BBC is covering it. 
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:10:49
Have faith my man. I've spent the last year or so down 60%. Right now I'm down 15%. It will get better. Ride it out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:44:08
It just hit £7k a second ago.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:36:07
I bought in big in Nov/Dec of 2017 after having a sizeable bonus. Approx 24k invested in bitcoin and some alts. Then the drop. Ended up with 9k. Did I panic? A bit. The panic in my stomach as I saw it dropping. Whilst no small amount I'd written it off at that point. Not completely though. I just knew I wouldn't have it back for quite some time. I stopped telling my friends about it. But at no point did I think of selling. I kept my mouth shut and waited. You only lose money if you sell at a loss. Last few days have been a validation in a way. I'm now in the black rather than red but there's a chance it'll go red again except maybe this time the red won't be so bad and maybe not so long. Who knows. All I know is, whilst I can't gauge the short term I'm 100% confident that in 10 years ( a timescale I set for myself) I will be more than comfortable. 
If you can stomach the wait, you'll be well rewarded.

Ah I see.That's a big help. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:55:43
Thanks all. I'm slowly getting my head around this.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:46:08
I still can't fully get my head around it but look forward to the the fact I'm going to be able to buy more bitcoin (I only have 1.85 at the moment). 
I only wish I'd overruled my Mrs in 2012 and spent £2k on them then. You live and you learn I suppose.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:21:57
It did indeed “rock”. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:00:05
Are the odds of that though not extremely low? Bitcoin Cash is still being traded and that was the result of a previous fork correct?
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:48:39
The Reddit community's calling out of EA's greedy and flawed micro-transaction system damaged their reputation and share price.
Who's to say the same can't happen again here.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:05:52
I've simply just looked though my bank statements to see how much I've paid out and when. I've include fees as part of my investment.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:26:52
How is it possible that after every fork there is money to be made from selling the alternative coin? Has this money not just come from nowhere?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:09:27
It’s already started turning again and BCH appears to be heading towards its previous value.
