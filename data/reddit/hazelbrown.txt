Not officially and it still continues in some parts of the company I believe but it's not as common as before.

My voicemail notification never leaves even when I call my service provider :(

Note that the previous spike only reached £999.94
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:57:13
Good luck but I would wait at least for a day or so just to see which way this price stagnation will take us. Either way I'm positive that you'll see gains in the long run :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:38:16
There is no guarantee that Bitcoin is the Crypto of the future. In ten years Bitcoins will be worth millions or nothing. Hard to say which. These are still early days in the cryptocurrency world :) 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:02:17
Thanks I did no know that.
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:57:29
cmc seems to be a bit out of sync with the exchanges right now. Things always get a bit hazy during these surges :)
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:34:37
I already have. I look forward to making gains when this bubble pops :)
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:41:10
We've been above 1500 for less than a month. I don't think it's quite possible to say that we'll barely see it gain :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:25:22
If people are looking for security and stability then they should stop looking at Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:51:45
Vitalik has already sold a lot of his eth. You're not worried that satoshi has over 1 million bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:43:38
It's far too early to say where this ends. It's ~1659 on bitrex right now
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:00:14
Because coinbase goes down every time there's market movement lol
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:52:24
Please look up what contradictory means because those statements are not contradictory at all. How does Donald Trump being "unfit for office" contradict the fact that he is in office. It is perfectly possible for both to be true and they don't contradict eachother.
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:23:38
It's not enough to retire on but don't kid around saying that it's not a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:14:52
Absolutely true. The problem with ethereum rising so quickly and so prominently out of nowhere is that it is likely to be majority owned by people who bought at $10 or less.
Bitcoin has the history and legacy such that it's value has been proven over time. That can't be said of eth right now though we will see. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:42:28
You don't owe bitcoin anything. It lives or dies on its own merit. It's up to you analyze that and decide whether it's worth it for you. This is not something that you can fight for or against.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:41:01
Except the value proposition of ethereum is nothing to do with its supply? Etc is a dead coin walking hyped by retards. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:22:34


This is nothing but a lie
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:41:36
Say that it's flat a week after the crash instead of 12 hours. It may yet fall again.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:58:31
Eth devs fixed the dao problem and ethereum moved on and upwards. The Bitcoin devs have done literally nothing to further Bitcoin in the last 2 years.
They are killing it. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:24:47
Actually it's in a far larger bubble right now
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:59:06
Ah thankyou, I wasn't aware of that. However the problem is that I think that a lot of new investors are interested in short term profit. They will pull out as soon as the market shows signs of slowing.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:47:23
This is a terrible analogy 
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:16:37
You forget that the people don't use Bitcoin yet. Why would the people invest in a currency where they have to spend $2 in fees every transaction and wait 8 hours for confirmations?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:02:54
It appears that MTGOX is shutting off the API to stop information on the drop getting out. For the time being [this seems to work](
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:59:42
Or down. Bitcoin isn't the be all and end all of cryptocurrency. I'm sure in the future we will use something very similar to Bitcoin but it won't be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:40:46
Then up to $1000 by the end of the week... right guys????? guise???
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:51:31
I do not live in the US but for the sake of the question, let us assume that I do :p
Perhaps the spending habits of the US Government are not exactly what I would do if I was in government but at least they protect the USD. [Here's]( an example of BTC being stolen. Some members of this sub refuses to believe that there are benefits from a government currency but if a bank were to lose your money, you can bet your bottom dollar that the bank would be responsible and have to reimburse you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:36:49
This whole post screams 'edgy anarchist'. Just sit down and shut up. Bankers are humans like you and me.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:04:17


Doesn't sound too decentralised to me. What happens when the government gets court orders to rollback trades they deem illegitimate?
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:19:34
Yeah, I kinda knew that my analogy sucked but I couldn't think of a proper one.
Tulip mania was a fascinating read on Wikipedia though and Berkshire Hathaway is also interesting regarding its phenomenol stock price.
Do you do Economics? What's your view on Bitcoin being a possible bubble.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:21:19


Bitcoin wallets are completely transparent and viewable by anyone.
@_date: 2013-03-27 13:35:33


False. If investing in Bitcoin is anything like shares, which it largely is, then bitcoin is much more likely to go from $10 to $100 than it is from $100 to $1000
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:21:26
Whatever is going on behind the scenes, the fact is that people are always going to gravitate towards the largest exchanges because there's easier selling to be done there.
Currency is meant to be centrallised.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:15:18
Of course noone can tell when it will reach peak for all time but once it starts falling, people will think that it has peaked for a long time and will attempt to get out quickly. Once it has hugely fallen, it will rise again as investors attempt to buy up the cheap bitcoins. Until it starts having some proper real world recognition to tie its value to tangible things, it will continue to fluctuate.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:04:26
I believe it's quoted on Bitcoinity
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:06:31
Bitcoin is inherently deflationary. It will never stabalise.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:12:24
Sorry, the numbers were off the top of my head but now it's [0.27BTC]( for a full pizza. The exact values don't matter, what matters is the hyper deflation. Not exactly a staple of stable currencies. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:23:03
Its gaining traction in the media and BBC news covered the crash this morning. Yes it's still a fringe market but my parents knew what bitcoin was before I told them.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:09:11
Personally, I think Bitcoin is a very interesting concept and it's great that there's a passionate group of people supporting it. I just personally believe that it's not viable in the long term.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:35:41
It truly is remarkable to think that this entire bubble started only 2 months ago. At that time, it was actually a really stable currency staying at about $20-$30 for ages. The golden age of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:18:39
Except they lied about maintenance on their twitter.
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:28:15
Of course. Unless you actually want to use your Bitcoins that is.
EDIT: Shit, I'm a retard.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:23:02
Thanks, I'll be sure to check it out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:15:57
If you're spouse lost more than $250,000 (?????) in what was essentially gambling, perhaps you may think twice about what your marriage is worth.
OP, I have no words to describe how sorry I feel for what you're going through now. Best of luck in the future and I hope that your marriage and financial health can withstand this shake up.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:38:08
Very generous of you. The ability to 'Bit tip' is actually one of things about Bitcoin that I really love. I'll be sure to pass the Bits on to anyone I feel is deserving :)

By cashing out just as bitcoin peaks, they would crash the Bitcoin economy. What reason do these people have not to cash out?
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:38:54
I didn't say it wasn't something new. I said that volatility isn't good for Bitcoin. Why don't you actually read my post and look at Bitcoins from both sides of the arguement instead of just flaming anyone who disagrees with it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:57:33
Yeah isn't it great that loads of people lost so much money??? /sarc
I didn't even invest but I'm tired of people trying to say that this crash is a good thing because it will keep away morons/unwise investors or increase the power of Bitcoin. It doesn't. This crash is probably the worst thing to happen to Bitcoin and perhaps ever will.
Cryptocurrencies are a great idea but Bitcoin is a long way off from where it should be.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:03:56
Who knows? There are floors every $10 or so where BTC refuses to drop and then suddenly it drops another $10. This is Bitcoin history right here and will be referenced for years as to why online crypto currencies can't work.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:01:07
Of course, MTGOX is trying to manipulate the markets but even they can't stop the pop.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:16:58
My problem is not that they wont have earned it, it's that they control a disproportional amount of the Bitcoin and thus the market.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:17:01
*which may increase or decrease in value by 25% every day.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:40:55
My problem is not that Bitcoin is too expensive, it's that it is controlled by the few. The 1% in BTC owns a far greater percentage of BTC than the 1% of flat currencies. I suspect that many of these topdogs are on this very sub :p but I think that it's a real problem facing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:55:07
They control the supply and thus the market.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:02:13


You know that BTC is completely transparent and anyone can see how much you own right?
