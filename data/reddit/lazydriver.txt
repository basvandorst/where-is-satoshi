Golden Gate is owned by the same guy who owns the D, which makes sense. As far as other hotels, I dunno.

Except that with applications like Bitpay, the bitcoin value stays stable during the entire transaction and is generally cheaper than using other methods of electronic transaction.
For example: I want to buy an item. The merchant wants to sell their item. I convert my USD into bitcoin, and the merchant converts the bitcoin into USD at almost the same time. While it seems more complicated than current systems, it's really not. It's practically the same as converting USD into Paypal USD and then back into USD, except it's decentralized so the fees are (for the moment) less and neither party has to worry about Paypal seizing the cash for itself and getting away with it. It also makes sure that the agreed USD to Bitcoin trade stays stable, with Bitpay paying the difference between the two times.

I actually completely agree with you. The success of this currency (by that, I mean, an accepted standard item for trading) depends entirely on its legitimacy. If it is rejected by the US Government or Chinese government, then it will die. The acceptance of both government for trade in this currency will lead to its success though - it has a niche, and that niche is sending cash with low fees and quick times. (The other obvious niche is the speculative aspects, but that in itself will not guarantee success.)

Well, then the natural thing to do is hold on until it reaches that value again or close enough to it where you'd accept a loss. It could crash to 0 or crash to $500, what difference does it make? Just hold on at this point imo. Good news can reverse the trend.
