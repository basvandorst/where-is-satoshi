So what you're saying is, each oil shipment is all moving to a single refinery? Most of the time?

If your math is right, that's one of the best comments on this thread. If there just isn't enough currency to go around, bitcoin is fucked.
EDIT: I'm not a retard and I understand how bitcoin works. I'm not saying bitcoin isn't feasible, I'm saying that if there isn't enough value in the bitcoin system to facilitate such large value trades, it's not going to be useful for oil trading or anything similar.
Would the value of bitcoin go up if it was accepted for oil? Maybe? Would mining then be more profitable, thus encouraging the production of more bitcoins? Yup, probably. Will it be accepted for oil trading? Hell no. Chicken and the egg.

Yes, and I just edited my post to explain my position better. I'm not saying bitcoin is forever screwed, just that right now it's probably not the best option for large trades of oil.

Of course not, and there's no reason to assume that ALL the oil on one ship is going to the exact same place or is part of the exact same trade. But if you're an oil company, you'd want to make logistics as smooth as possible. That means trading in one currency. It's the whole reason to have the petrodollar in the first place. Right now, they can't use bitcoin to facilitate all their trading, but they could use any number of national currencies like the dollar.
It would be like a company operating in Spanish and English. It isn't efficient. The company would do better to pick one or the other. Eventually bitcoin might have the strength that oil needs, but from a layman's perspective, I don't see this current Kuwait thing happening.

You pay a bill through taxes if you don't pay it at the hospital/doctor.
Just enjoy the joke.

Wowee. This is like watching people still talk about developments in candle technology just a few years after Edison built the light bulb.

Nobody uses it. Step out of the circlejerk. Try unsubbing from every crypto subreddit and see how often people mention bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-29 18:59:18
OP is talking about referring to mBTC so that noobs/outsiders aren't so totally confused. Bitcoin is very confusing for people who have no economic or technical background, and we need those people to adopt. Bitcoin can't just be a nerd experiment forever. It needs to be real.
