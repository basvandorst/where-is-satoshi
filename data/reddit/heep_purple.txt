Could you please explain to me how the idea of "Buying a pizza for a price I know is 10$" and "buying bitcoin in the hope it goes up in price exponentially" can coexist. I have received a bitcointip "Taco" which suddenly was double the worth. I was very happy, but right now I would not buy anything with bitcoin because suddenly I actually paid 20$ for a pizza.
Edit : made it a bit less aggressive

Beause people lost a fuckload back then too. Some people don't like to wait a few years again until their life savings are back.

Haha yeah. Companies should always stay one step ahead of their competitors.

Could you please explain what escrow services are? I have never heard of those, maybe because English is not my native language of just because I'm not well informed enough.

Friends of mine recommended bitcoin to me. It is just the most efficient (worldwide) trading currency and I love anyone who tries to make it even more efficient! Godspeed to you!

Of course. You can't revert a bitcoin purchase without a trusted third person in between. Got it.

It was just regulation. Chinese big buyers were just buying to get more profit and drove the price up a lot. Now there are less people just buying from emotion and the people who believe in bitcoin as a working currency are left. That is a good thing.
