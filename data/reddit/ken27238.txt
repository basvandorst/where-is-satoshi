For the love of everything holy that pupper better be named Satoshi.

No. It’s shipped and sold by a third party. Not Walmart itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:44
Gdax just crashed. Coinbase is freaking out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:29
Eh I’m giving it room for fluctuations. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:03:33
At least 4 were honest.

Hey cousin wanna go bowling?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:59
That can’t be right. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:16
Not surprised, someone just dumped 12btc. Saw it on Gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:13:57
So like a server. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:33
CHOO CHOO.

In the past week or so I’ve doubled my bitcoin “investment”!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:15:53
If you’re that paranoid about keyloggers then there are bigger issues here that your bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:41
Wtf is happening.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:13
Coinbase and Gdax are crashing for me right now. Trying to get crypto pro on iOS to update, still shows me $3496.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:11
Monday morning is my bet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:54
My bet is 20k Monday morning. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:45
Might have to do with bitcoin about to breach 17k.

That’s up to the Unicode consortium. Not Apple. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:48:11
Technically not an emoji. Just part of the Unicode character set. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:17
Huh. Apple didn’t implement it then?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:22:57
No me. I can’t even chose which coin to buy. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 13:45:38
Yea. The one right above the key is the first. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:23:43
The app is dead for me too. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:12:18
Speak for yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:33:36
It also shows me account disabled not the grayed our buying screen. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:32:54
Okay. I’m on mobile so it’s kinda weird. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:27:44
Can’t buy ETH or LTC. 
@_date: 2019-04-18 18:47:05
Very superb
