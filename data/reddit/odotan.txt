thanx for your tip. I completely get what you're saying, and indeed, not everyone has a facebook account (and this is especially true in the bitcoin community). However, as you will also read in the FAQ on the site, we do this to increase what we call the "organic trust" of the system (see below the line)
Secondly, since our aim is to bring bitcoin to the masses, we've selected facebook as a platform to reach all those who will likely never hear about bitcoin if it were up to them. The fact that you get invited to join, with a financial incentive, makes it interesting for all those users that we're actually targeting - everybody :)
here's the part of the FAQ about "organic trust"
- How do I get it?
Yes, we rely on facebook for almost all interactions. We do this for several reasons.
- Everybody is on facebook (well… almost everybody).
- People are used to sending facebook messages using their friends’ names, and we wish bitconnect to be as easy as that.
- Additionally, we do this for what we call “organic trust”. That’s trust that doesn’t come from computer security or cryptography, it’s person-to-person trust. Facebook accounts are harder to fake than email accounts, and if we see someone who has 600 friends and is on facebook for 7 years, we know it’s more likely to be a real person than someone who just signed up and has no friends. When the new user with no friends suddenly has 50 friends and invites all of them we might start suspecting that it’s fake users and might be someone who wants to misuse the system.

yes! this is exactly what we wish to do with bitconnect: make bitcoin so easy, everyone can use it. So easy that you're not even aware you're using some kind of crazy new internet money :)

Hi, thanx for your feedback.
We're working on some tooltip balloons that will appear right after signup to point you to where you need to go and what the functionality of each element is.
As I said, we're changing the wallet paradigm to a messenger paradigm, similar to the SMS chats in phones.
To help you in the mean time, the connect button at the top right allows you to open up a new conversation with either a bitconnect user, or a bitcoin address. You can scroll through your facebook friends list, search for a name at the top (which would also give you other signed up users names), or paste/QR a bitcoin address.
Does this help to clear up some of the confusion?
thanx again for checking it out. please invite all your friends.

that's my buddy Vitalik! thanx a lot :)
yes, Vitalik Buterin, aka "Mr. ethereum" wrote the initial code for bitconnect. Vitalik, Inventor of ethereum, head writer of bitcoin magazine, and one of the leading minds of the bitcoin community, and all-round nice guy to have around.
Here's what he's up to today:
thanx a million Vitalik :)

Hi, thanx for your feedback,
You can send to any bitcoin address by typing/pasting/QRing a bitcoin address on the connect screen. Notice that you have to have satoshi in order to send to a bitcoin address. You can convert the thanx that you received to satoshi (bitcoin transaction costs of 10,000 satoshi will be added), or you can send bitcoin to the bitcoin address that was generated for your wallet (you can see it on the me screen), and then send those satoshi to any bitcoin address.

Hi, thanx for your feedback. We're very eager to hear people's experiences.
When you press the connect button, you'll get a list of your facebook friends. If any of them are already signed up, you'll get them at the top of the list. Below you will get the friends who are not signed up yet, with an invite button, so you can invite them (and receive thanx when they sign up).
If none of your friends are signed up, you can start entering a name of someone who is signed up, but is not a facebook friend, and their name will appear once at least three characters are entered.
If you just wish to send to a bitcoin address, on the connect page, you can simply enter (or copy/paste/QR) a bitcoin address. A conversation window with that address will open up. You can then enter the number of satoshi, and click send.
Regarding the number of invitations available in the system (193 of 512), this number is t GLOBAL, so all users see this same number. Currently, the number of invitations is limited because we wish to make sure our servers can handle the load, and allow more invitations accordingly. In other words,  use those invitations before they're gone :)

Hi again, in case any of you tried to sign-up but got a message that you have to be invited, please try now. I had the invitation-only switch turned on... I turned it off now. Please try again. thanx :)
