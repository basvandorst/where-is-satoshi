I said nothing about camera, they need permission for the pictures and video files. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:22:47
Nope, that's people like me, nee to bitcoin and can t afford much. Maybe today is payday and some bloke is buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:16:29
Assuming that Bitcoin survives too and is still profitable/convenient to use.

Give a man 0.1 and he will hold for a day. Give a man 250 and he will hold for a lifetime.

100$? Should've holded that. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:10:47
We are at the start of the bubble as more and more people begin to buy bitcoin. The similarities in graph ( begining of 2013 and where we are now. Yeah. This or that.

If it exceeds 11000£, start paying because there is nothing you can do.

I usually go around 10% of my monthly paycheck. Saving more than investing though. Good or bad ? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:20:21
It dropped to 3600 a couple of days ago then returned to 4000+. It was quick as shit, damn.

If only the world was fair to everyone.

On LocalBitcoins are different sellers selling at different prices since you don't have to be verified to buy.  
Coinbase, did you look at the price of Bitcoin from the Dashboard or you tried to buy ? That price is the current price of bitcoin not the price they are selling on.

I cut sugary drinks. Now I drink tap water. It's a slow walk but one good, already made some profit out of my investing. Not much but accounting how much I invested it's some ROI right there, boy.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:21:32
Game over. No more coins, no more mining (unless new coins appear but I doubt that will happen in 20-25 years. Just think how technologically advanced we will be. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:13:29
I doubt people will mine that far if the price wouldn't be 1.000.000 at least per bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:54:28
I said that it doesn't ask for camera permision, only MEDIA FILES (videos and pictures) and you do not use these in a bitcoin wallet, am I wrong ? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:06:56
Oh then I had fake information. Thanks for the correction.  
What happens when there is no bitcoin to mine ?
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:41:35
Holy Crap is the right answer since if you think of it, maybe someone is $100 million richer today maybe not.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:24:07
Localbitcoins. They have National bank transfer via sort code and account number.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:57:11
The seed is safe, for what do I exactly need a back up for ? The Electrum Wallet asked for MEDIA FILES permission. Not camera!  
So I give acces to every picture and video file to a bitcoin wallet with what purpose ? It can't read QR codes and what in the hell does it have to do with video files ? I do not want an app having acces to my MEDIA FILES. They ask acces on my external but not on my INTERNAL. Again: what does it have to do with my videos and pictures ? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:15:56
I'm not throwing a fuss, I guess that's how you see me because I'm writing and not speaking. Alright, mate.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:09:07
Can we make buildings that mine automatically ? Something like a server room.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:17:52
Do you call that a competent answer ? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:14:58
Fuck electrum then. I just installed Copay and it asked zero permissions and I still could transfer my funds from Electrum Desktop to Copay Mobile without the need to give any permissions. I find it weird it can scan QR codes without a camera permission plus I don't have any compromising pictures/videos but I'm very fond of my privacy.  
If I have any..
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:52:31
Incompetent ? Excuse me ? Lol.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:27:07
All I'm ddoing is just speculating. Maybe it will turn out as in 2013 and the patrern is the same but since the numbers are bigger, the scale is bigger or maybe not.
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:14:17
So if I remove the wallet from my hardware, I still can recover my cents after those years using the seed safe phrase? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:39:45
Harassment ? Don't tell me, you're a genderfluid pansexual. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:13:38
It takes 21$ to buy the same things 100 years ago with 1$ then.
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:18:01
Yes, I understood it needs camera but they didn't ask for that permission. I'm buying&amp;holding. Buying then receiving on my wallet adress. I do not need the QR codes feature as I do not use it. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:49:01
Now. As people said, Bitcoin is a gamble. You can't know for certain if it reaches 10k or more nor if it drops to 20 dollars in 5 years.   
As Bitcoin movement grows, spreads around the world  and it's improving constantly to make buying, selling and paying more accesible to the mundane man you could say it would reach 10k+ due to limited quantity and decentralisation(?).  
Maybe something happens and it dies making it unavailable anymore or at a very low value. The Bitcoin market capital is around 70 billion dollars at the current price. That s a lot of money here, man.  
You never know so to answer your question :  
Buy as much as you can afford to lose. 50$ this week, 40$ next week and so on. Don't spend more than 10% of your monthly paycheck on it if you re working around 1500$ a month.  
If you re doing a shitton of money buy as I have said, what you can afford to lose.  
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:23:18
Do not reply if you do not have a competent answer. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:09:58
TO BUY AND HOLD!
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:18:26
Yea, the camera is self-explanatory and it didn't ask for that but for video and picture FILES.

Thank you for your support. Sometimes is not you the problem. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:19:42
And if I do not want to make a back-up ? I said nothing about camera but media FILES. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:59:13
Yeah sure. I.m going to tell politicians from my country to...just stop being corrupt so I can have better wages in order to buy 0.1btc instead of 0.01. Great idea mate.  
And you want to make Bitcoin global when you tell those poor guys that they need to evaluate their finances. Brilliant.

Some profit, you'll have 250 if it reaches 10k.
