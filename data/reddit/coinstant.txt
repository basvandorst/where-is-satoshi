Hi Gerfeben, thanks for the notice. Luckily we established good relations with our bank in The Netherlands. We were able to get banking with them without any trouble. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:50:56
Luckily we are not located in the US. We don’t hold any US Dollars ourselves so there is no way we can get associated with the US government. Also we just buying your digital currency, in The Netherlands it’s an asset and not a currencies. 
Referring to the domain name, it’s impossible for the US government to seizes a domain name because they want to. As we are a company based in The European Union and complying with  there laws they won’t touch our domain name, that would anger the EU lawmakers for a 100%.
Just take a look at the PirateBay . Org domain they can’t take it down and it’s the most law braking domain in the world.
Trust us we did our homework, we will provide you guys with a 24/7 unlimited top notch service.

The European Union nor the government of the Netherlands see crypto currencies as a real currencies its a asset. So we can buy your digital currencies like you would buy a tv form walmart.
Nothing special we just buying your digital currencies from you and we pay you via the methods that you would like.
We are not required by law to ask any identification or have any KYC/AML policy as that is only required for financial institutions and we are not a financial institution.
This is all confirmed by the De Nederlandsche Bank also know as the Dutch Central Bank.

Yes it does, the US government has no saying about a company under EU laws. Even if they don’t like our service that need to deal with it.
We use a variety of partners to send money cheap to the US, they hold US Dollars.

Hi Spookmann,
The screenshot is from our early Beta testing, our platform will be more optimized on launch. 
These are test transactions on the Beta, however it will be free to receive and send money to/from other Coinstant users.
It’s not going to be possible to directly purchase from Amazon but we have a API ready for merchants that will accept Coinstant as an payment. So soon you can also pay with your Coinstant account at merchants.
What merchants will accept Coinstant is not disclosed yet, but very soon.

Ik will PM you as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:17:05
It’s not the wild Wild West, we have laws on government and European levels to protect us against any foreign government involvement. Don’t worry about us we did our homework. We are now going to provide you a services that will blow you away. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:25:10
I really want to give you a reaction but I’m trying to figure out what you are taking about.
We where schooled? Please before you assume something learn the European Laws, a bank can’t reversal a SEPA transaction if another bank already received it. I never heard that one.
If you deposit via bank wire SEPA/Swift there is now way it can rever
I’m not going in detail but,
We can’t send cash per post with the EU without any troubles. We don’t know how country’s outside the EU will react to that, so it’s on own risk as we clearly stated before.
(PostNL is the biggest postal company in the Netherlands)
It’s even weirder that you can tell if we are Dutch of not. I can only laugh about that comment. 
And we are not an exchange we don’t have order books. It’s like a Coinbase wallet. You sell your digital currencies, you account is funded with the choice fiat currency and then you can simple withdraw your money. No magic.
It’s really weird, if way announce the same project with extreme high fees, if requirement it’s all good. But when one company want to break the barrel for the whole community it’s not trustworthy?
On the launch you will see it for yourself that there is a really professional and trustworthy company behind it.
We love comment bad en good, that how we build a better platform.
With love, 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:43:27
Thank you ����
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:56:30
Well that a first, we just got us green bar yesterday to verify that we are a legit company.
So I guess we are going to stop the launch ������
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:31:36
The US government can sue us but I doesn’t have the legal status to get us to court. You can withdraw to US however we do not and will not own any US Dollars. We will only hold Euro, so in that case the US government has no saying about us.
They may say we are money laundering however we can’t check the source of digital currencies, We operate in European Union where all of our services are a 100% legit and doesn’t qualify as money laundering. We do not operate in any US jurisdictions.

Hi DrBitgood, this week we will launch our website. We choice to already make the announcement because we want to be connect with our community and building a relationship before hand. When we launch you will be blown away, we promise. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:59:12
That’s not true, it was because of talks between the European Union and Switzerland to stop tax money flowing out of the EU illegally . They come to a agreement that they can request bank information from any EU citizens.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:50:58
Hi Lizard450,
Thank you very much, we neither btw.
I think the biggest problems for those company where that they did hold US Dollars (if and only if you hold US Dollars you will fall under US laws and regulations , according to there laws. Not the EU) and most of them where shell company’s because there where located somewhere in east-Europe. 
We have the privilege to be a Dutch origin company. That’s why we can have real banking without using a shell company somewhere in the the Caribbean . 
We pay taxes, we comply with any regulations and requirements of the EU and Dutch government.

Hi Alphgeek, sorry you feel that way. Please tell us where you find spelling mistakes. We would love to edit them straight away.

Hi Doukara,
We where thinking about that, and we will support CashPerMail. You can receive a maximum of €5000 per mail, because that’s the maximum amount the parcel company (PostNL)
will insurance by lost of package.
However we are looking into to the laws of each country for receiving CashPerPost. So on launch you will need to do research by yourself if it’s allowed to receive EURO per mail. 
It will not be cheap around €150 + 5%, it’s take a lot of work.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:19:36
We have 2 options.
Option 1. Normal sell: take a maximum of 1-2 days to receive in your PayPal.
Option 2. Bitcoin InstantSell receive your money with 4 hours. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:04:20
Good to hear !! And yes we implemented Segwit, and we are going to batch trx. Keeping the fees low is really important.
