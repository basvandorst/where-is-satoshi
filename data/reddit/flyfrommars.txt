That's why he got 6 years. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:45:11
You're right. We all know the many atm success stories that have been posted here. 
Nice downvoting. I thought this sub totally hated censorship?
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:38:41
Of which 450 don't work or get used once a month. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:50:23
The free market will sort it out. It would be against their rational self-interest to scam you. 
And next time use an escrow service when using an escrow service. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 05:59:47
Ross running a huge drug market, selling drugs himself, involved in hacking, fraud, money laundering and trying to have 6 people killed? Set the man free!
Someone stealing money. 6 years! Burn the mofo!
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:07:47
Sensationalism much?
@_date: 2015-12-07 12:57:55
The bots create demand. The price going up makes people buy more, yes. 
But besides maybe that MMM thing it isn't based on anything. There are no fundamentals. If China stops pumping we'll be back at 220 in no time. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:21:18
I assume you are taking a huge loan then to buy coins?
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:33:55
You can't possibly really think that way. That would be completely absurd. 
And again why should this guy get a longer sentence?
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:57:46
What would you say is a reasonable jail time for stealing those coins?
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:14:43
Dude, it's been know as a scam for months already. Get over it. 
For some reason in the real world out there scams get known within days and people stop using them but as soon as butcoin is involved people just keep sending their money for months and months. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:16:21
How many more months are you people gonna start these kind of threads? 
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:24:20
Edit: I seriously get downvoted for asking why??
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:26:46
Where the hell did you see me typing 100% of the volume is fake? You make something up and then attack me for it? Wtf?
@_date: 2015-12-07 12:52:55
As has been explained 100 times already: what you are seeing are bots trading fake volume. 
These bots are turned on and off. As soon as they are turned off the price drops. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:24:21
You are just an ideas guy i assume?
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:33:26
Usually the smart comments here are the ones which are downvoted. You simply follow the circle jerk. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:06:58
The police? I thought we hated the police and the government and that's why we use bitcoin. 
Who suggested the police? He should be banned from this place!
No, you don't ask help from those jackbooted thugs! The free market will sort it out!
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:26:00
Yet you people downvote the fuck out of every comment that "isn't good for bitcoin". 
Maybe it's time to stop crying about censorship until this sub stops downvoting comments just because they go against the circle jerk. 
Now watch the downvotes come in. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:44:54
You really need to start a thread about 10 bucks?
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:39:13
But Ross "just ran a website", right?
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:08:28
Why is it expected? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:32:27
Uh why? You come to a public discussion board and then only want to read things that you agree with?
It's absolutely crazy how you people need to know which posts are upvoted and downvoted by the hive mind before reading a public discussion. 
The need to censor people in this sub you disagree with is absolutely retarded. And you wonder why people call this an echo chamber. 
OP: i'm letting you know that several people disagree with my opinion so i'm being downvoted. So you can safely downvote me as well knowing that you'll fit right in. Your fellow sheep will appreciate it. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:47:02
Yes, that will surely work. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 14:45:15
They still laugh at Bitcoin. That's why they won't use it. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:11:34
All he did was transfering 0's and 1's in a non-violent way. Most people would agree this is legal. And you say he deserves 15 years for that??
So much for freedom and the free market. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:44:03
The free market will sort it out. Because he would never scam you with such a feedback. That would be against his rational self-interest. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:45:25
Amazon might not give support to people using stolen gift cards. Just a friendly tip. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 15:30:04
Exactly. I absolutely was not talking about the tons of stories about non working atm's, insane fees and other issues. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:45:10
Yes, which is a very harsh sentence for the crime he committed. You realize that, right?
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:16:01
So fake bot volume isn't meaningless? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:58:17
No real libertarian will seek help from the jackbooted thugs. 
The decentralized free market will sort it out. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:27:19
Because Ross what?
@_date: 2015-12-06 20:32:34
Which banks exactly scooped up a boat load of coins and then embraced Bitcoin? Can you name a few?
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:16:21
How do you know the market was non-violent? Where do you get the idea the 100's of vendors got their dope in a non-violent way?
And the 6 hits he ordered, would you say that is a non-violent thing to do?
@_date: 2015-12-08 06:30:09


How big is the loan you're taking to go all in in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-08 06:40:10
How huge would you say this is? As huge as the 200 other projects that were HUGE and would take bitcoin to the moon? Less huge, more huge?
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:36:27
You use a bot for trading. These bots are completely different. They are used to manipulate the price. So yes, they are meaningless. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 05:49:46
I'm just following the libertarian logic this sub loves so much. Pay attention. 
It's funny how none of you have a problem with "Ross just ran a website" but apply that stupidity to LE and you people go nuts.
