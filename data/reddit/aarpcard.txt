I used to have the same car, and sold it a few months ago.  Mine had 150,000 miles and had some issues.  Still got the equivalent of 4 BTC for it. 
You're selling yourself low haha

Is this an isolated incident or are more people having similar issues?  Maybe coinbase is runnning low on BTC reserves . . . I never store coins in hosted addresses, but I'm still thinking of switching to Circle permanently.

I believe there is a great possibility that Bitcoin will pave the way towards a truly global civilization within the next 50-100 years.
The main thing that separates countries from each other is their currency and their economy.  When both of these are globalized, there's fewer reasons for countries to remain separate and actually more positive reasons that promote the unionization of countries.
For example, with Europe and the Euro, on an economical scale, you're far more likely to think of Europe as an entity than to consider each individual country within Europe.
People routinely think I'm daft for saying it, but the potential for Bitcoin to be THE global currency in 50-100 years is HUGE.  And that's why its so important to get in to Bitcoin now.  As far as I'm concerned, we are still very much on the ground floor.  If Bitcoin went global, 1 coin would be worth 1/21000000th of the world's net worth or very, very roughly 100 million USD.

But if having as many people as possible at the top of the mountain is advantageous to those already at the top,  then those at the top would prioritize helping others up.

Same here.  Every paycheck I buy as much as I can safely afford regardless of price.  I'm treating it as a secondary savings account.
In my opinion the price now doesn't matter one iota compared to what the price will be in 60 years when Bitcoin is the dominant global currency.

The more people who use Bitcoin,  the more the currency is worth.   Why would we ever want to keep people out? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:40:45
Having to maintain a 135+gb file just to run a full node/have a local wallet is a hardship that causes a lot of people to turn away from Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:00:07
I'd consider keeping it, not selling it. 
That real money you speak of isn't all that real. It's all fugazi. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:54:50
That's not the point of Bitcoin.... Why sell it, when I can buy shit with it?

No.  
Gold is worth whatever people are willing to give you for it.  It's not limited to paper currency. 
The point is nothing - gold, paper currency, Bitcoin - is backed by anything.  These things only have value because people give them value. 
People give these currencies value based upon how useful they are. 
Bitcoin = HIGH usefulness 
- Deflationatory
- Triple entry accounting 
- Annonimity
- Security
- Easy to buy and sell and trade
- Not widely adopted yet
Gold = moderate usefulness 
Positives: 
- Deflationatory
- Fairly Secure
- Fairly easy to buy and sell
- Single entry accounting 
- Hard to trade
- No longer widely adopted
- Not as anonymous as BTC
Paper Currency = low usefulness 
- Easy to buy, sell, and trade
- Widely adopted
- Inflationary 
- Double Entry Accounting 
- Not secure 
- No longer anonymous

Are you serious right now? 1btc is worth 1btc.  It's worth whatever you can buy with it. 
Will someone sell me a car for 1BTC?  If so, then 1BTC is worth 1 car. 
Will someone sell me 10000 Twix bars for 1btc?  If so, then 1btc is worth 10000 Twix bars.

Lmfao!  You've lost soo much. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:00:00
Because legal markets use an inflationary currency, regulated by governments. 
IMO the entire point of Bitcoin is to move the world back to a deflationary currency.  If the normal money you own (fiat) is worth less tomorrow than it is today then you are much more easily controlled by the entity setting the prices (government and banks). 
If your currency (BTC) will be worth more tomorrow than it is today due to the fact there is a limited number in existence (you can't simply print more bitcoin) combined with more and more people buying into the currency, AND government can't control it because it retains all of the annominity of cash, you as a result have ever growing financial freedom. 
I don't mean to be condescending, but I don't understand why people find this so abstract. 
The world used to work this way when we were on the gold standard.  BTC is like gold, but far easier to buy, sell, and unlike gold, can easily be spent on goods and services. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:48:17
That's why you just buy and never stop buying. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:28:09
My philosophy is hodl my coins until the price is lower than the average cost I've paid per coin.  
It would have to drop to $245 for me to sell and then I'd break even. 
And then I'd buy back when it hit $245 again. 
For me to sell my hodl otherwise, the price would have to be &gt;$100,000 per coin
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:34:59
But you can touch Bitcoin. 
I don't see how a paper wallet is any different than paper cash (from a tangible perspective). Both have a value not tied to the physical matter (paper and ink) they are made of.  
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:07:53
I'm in the exact same situation.  Bank says transaction cleared last week, and Coinbase says funds should arrive on Monday (yesterday).  
There's something strange going on here. 
However I just successfully did a debit card buy for 0.1BTC  from Coinbase... 
Let me know if / when you get your funds.  If I don't get them by 3am tomorrow, I'm going to be really concerned.    I hate to say it but this is bringing back MT Gox memories. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:37:13
Hmmm I like this.  Where can I buy gold with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:26:44
Generate a paper wallet using an offline computer with preferably a freshly installed OS.

Omg that's hilarious. Buying real money with fake money. Genius! 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:30:43
Hmm I guess my confusion is that it doesn't fit with my use case for Bitcoin. 
I hodl in cold storage paper wallets.  Buy coins on exchanges and then send directly to paper wallets. 
Any actual purchases I intend to make with BTC, I buy the coin on an exchange and then immediately send it to the merchant.  I can look up my paper wallet activity using blockchain.io.
I never have funds on an exchange or third party service for more than a few minutes and they're never large funds.  And my long term coins are kept in paper wallets.  I guess there no real reason for me to run a full node... Other than supporting the network....

Well I think it was invented to buy drinks at your local pub. 
Look at the big perspective.  The goal of Bitcoin is to move the world to a deflationary, deregulated currency. 
The whole point is to buy drinks (and everything else, including illegal stuff).  It just so happens illegal/questionable markets have adopted it early because they've seen the benefit of using Bitcoin in their dealings. 
Using BTC for legal transactions doesn't see any less of a benefit compared to the illegal dealings. 
The point isn't to use it for illegal transactions.  The point is to use it for ALL transactions.  
If you want two other examples of mass adoption:
-Alternative investing - i.e. Buy Bitcoin to diversify your portfolio. 
-Clearnet Marketplaces like Newegg or countless other small businesses.

Very early adopter here too.  Don't have as much coin as I should - that's what happens when  you're young and broke in the early days.  But I have enough now, that I'll be with y'all on the moon too. 
It seems that the average person in Bitcoin now is in just for the speculation and they have no idea what Bitcoin actually is... 
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:26:44
My price is so high that BTC will be the only currency in the world if my price is ever realized. 
Then I won't need to sell it - only spend it. 
This won't prevent me from switching to another crypto if something comes around that's better than BTC - however, I don't see that happening any time soon or possibly even ever.  Any problems BTC has will get resolved as the currency evolves.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:39:08
Tumble the living shit out of the coins.  When getting them back from the tumbler, put them in several smaller wallets with random amounts. 
Don't tumble them all at once either.  Tumble a small percentage at random intervals over the course of a few months. 
No one is going to have the time or money to track that - and if they do, there's still no smoking gun you still have them.

Low.  $600 was low.  $200 was low.

If you're in it for the long term, the risk is nearly nothing.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:28:27
There's a bit more to it. If BTC truly became mainstream - as in it was the only currency in use in the entire world, then the price would fluctuate proportionally to world population fluctuations. 
If the population increased forever, then the price of BTC would increase forever.  If the population started decreasing, then so would the price of BTC. 
If you factor out the speculation in BTC right now, the only thing (and I don't say 'only' to diminish the importance) giving BTC its value is the fact that there are a finite number of coins that will ever exist and it's user base has been constantly increasing. 
A true deflationary currency (which is what BTC is) that went mainstream will only see price changes with respect to population changes. 
So if Bitcoin goes mainstream and the earth hits a population limit of, say 20billion people, then the Bitcoin price with be stagnant.  
But by the time Bitcoin goes mainstream, hopefully humans will be living on the moon and maybe Mars and the population of humans in the universe will grow, thus increasing Bitcoin's price even though the population on earth is stagnant.

1) Format HDD
2) Install a fresh OS
3) Never connect the fresh OS to the Internet. 
4) Generate several paper wallets
5) Make several copies of each paper wallet
6) Store paper wallets in a fireproof safe. 
7) Don't let any individual paper wallet become worth too much.
