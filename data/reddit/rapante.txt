That's exactly what I'm saying. Don't you see this? You keep Bitcoin and your independence if you transact on chain. You get PayPal when you need to rely on off-chain solutions that are necessarily centralized with all the risks that brings.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:27:20


Perhaps it is a good time to reevaluate your believes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:29:19
You will not have a reasonable discussion about this in this sub. But kudos for trying.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:23:01
If you just disregard my arguments and simply claim the opposite conclusion, you're not making a point, you're covering your eyes and ears. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:37:51
No. To the contrary. There was no premine, every btc hodler got some. Even better, it scales for current demand and has a clear roadmap for future scaling that will not force users into centralized off-chain solutions. Many find that compelling. People make economic decisions, you will have to account for that or all you will see is conspiracies.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:45:36
They cannot take it down. The only thing to take it down is economic decisions by crypto users/traders/investors. They will decide the value and meaning. We will see how it plays out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:29


Correct. Limiting blocksize does.


Not necessarily. You still need on chain for opening and closing channels, which takes capacity. Also, for LN to be decentral, it can only be practically used for small and micro transactions. Otherwise you would either have to dedicate very large funds to the channel to allow for routing or frequently open and close channels, which would defeat the purpose. The only practical model for normal transactions would be a hub topology, which is the definition of central.


Node centralization ist not an issue. If you really feel you have to run a full node (which you don't), a 10 TB hard drive will store a year's worth of gigabyte blocks. 
But do you expect people to store complete blockchains on their phones? SPV clients are the solution for the masses if adoption on a large scale is the goal.
If centralization is really your concern, then I have a hard time understanding how you would support strategies that lead to actual centralization, instead of those that avoid them.


From a utility standpoint, not from a technical one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:26:17
There would be no security risk in a moderate increase. That's an untrue narrative to force Segwit and LN adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:29:52
To add, btc has become quite useless a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:36:20
As you are obviously not ready or willing to have a reasonable discussion, I withdraw from this conversation.
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:32:53


Why not? Bigger blocks mean more tx/block, so more fees.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:08:55
But it is a solution short and medium term. And that is what is needed now. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:27:24


Mostly this is a disadvantage because it severely limits throughput. 


Is that even profitable without ASICs?


Not a problem with standard pc hardware and a good internet connection.


That is perhaps of some value. We will see if it's enough.


Which can be adopted fairly easily.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:40:26
On-chain and off-chain scaling are not mutually exclusive. Likely, both are needed in the long run. But who do you think will run second layer payment hubs? They will necessarily increase centralization, no way around it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:16:03


It did not have to come to this. It is only this annoying because some other group has been preventing a much more painless and quick upgrade path.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:21:08
For one, because it would have provided immediate (though probably short-lived) scaling and realistic potential for additional increases in the future. Also, the BCH split showed that the combined value of the two resulting coins may exceed that of the original.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:09:47
And everybody who actually wants to use it as medium of exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:17:28
The people potentially using btc as payment have to pay the fees for every purchase. It is them who will be dissuaded.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:24:46
It's not about competence but conflicting business interests.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:31:59


Maybe not forever, but surely a couple of years. 


That does not make much sense. It's already functional as a payments system, provided blocksize does not limit. Also, what is a gold vault? A blockchain that's only useful as store of value due to artificially low throughput? Really? The store of value property does not go away when you increase capacity so there is nothing to build on top for that purpose.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:36:59
There is not much point accepting btc for low value products, considering the fee situation.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:52:45


How would one do that?
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:23:06
If both sides dump the other one and perhaps buy their own then there will emerge a price equilibrium, with the sum of both coins perhaps being of similar value as btc pre fork. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:47:07
This is more if the same.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:09:37
Do you realize you are doing the very thing you are critisizing?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:21:51
This includes complex smart contracts. Simple transfers are very cheap.
