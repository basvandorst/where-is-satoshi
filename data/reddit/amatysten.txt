Please, go educate yourself. What you've written there is NOT how LN works.
I'll just point out that the channel is open only when the opening transaction hits the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:04:40
Yes, it can screw the party with broken computer if they do not have a backup of the latest state of the channel or if they do not relaunch the client in time (7 days I think).
However, the other side does not know that. As far as they are concerned, their counterparty stopped responding (it could mean anything) and they must close a channel by broadcasting the latest state.
Let's say they suspect that something went wrong with their counterparty and want to cheat by broadcasting the invalid state. They can then get punished and lose all their funds in the channel. And there is no way to guarantee a safe bet, as you don't know whom you are dealing with. The routing is anonymous.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:35:56
Yes, that's correct, you need to backup every last transacton, discarding the previous backup. I misunderstood that you've complained about the storage requirements, must be something else.
Regular users will not lose money after "big hub" failure. LN keeps funds from every channel in a different multisig addresses. When exchange goes down you just unilaterally close the channel with the current state.
If you mean that after exchange becomes insolvent users that kept money there will lose them. That's true, but people should not be doing that anyway. And it's not related to LN, hub cannot "reallocate" the locked money and does not have any ownership over them.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:03:50
There could be solutions like cold storage, where you authorize every LN transaction with airgapped device. Right now it's all still in experimental phase.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:27:29
Probably because no other app recognizes the way electrum represents their segwit addresses. Omniwallet considers it completely different private key, because of 82 in front.

I'll address misconceptions that I see in your previous post.
When channel is open two parties make a commitment transaction that must be recorded on the blockchain. They basically put their funds into mutual multisig adress. Before doing that they give each other a signed transaction that will allow every party to withdraw their initial funds. Let's say, A gets 1 BTC and B gets 1 BTC.
After that they update "the current state of the channel". For example, A gets 1.5 and B gets 0.5, implying that B just paid A 0.5 of his funds. This transaction does not hit the blockchain, but can be broadcasted at any moment. It also contains information that invalidates "the previous state". This can be done as many times as needed.
If the counterparty B tries to broadcast the previous invalid state their transaction gets a delay, giving party A time to broadcast the current state, punishing B by taking their full funds from that channel.
Your client checks every transaction given by the counterparty, including fees. Thus, giving zero-fee transaction will be rejected. It can also make sure that "punishing" transaction has higher fee than "old state one". And you can use CPFP during the delay if needed, spending part of counterparty's funds for that.
And miners' fees are paid by both parties. If you want to simply lock my funds by not responding you're punished by paying the same fee I do.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:40:47
First, due to how LN works you only need to backup the last state of the channel, that is, just one transaction. Unless of course you're a malicious actor and want to trick the counterparty with the old state at some point in the future) In which case you need to keep two transactions)
No money printing can happen, because, contrary to what some people think, LN transaction is NOT actually IOU. One has to commit actual BTC to every channel.
And if an exchange collapses and their backups are gone people will be able to broadcast the old state indeed. But exchanges must protect themselves from those risks, it's a security flaw and no different from being hacked if they lose their backups.
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:04:32
Wallets do all of those checks/updating/punishing/routing automatically. The only thing user has to worry about is which node to pay to.
To put it the simple way, let's say you want to pay for your utilities with bitcoin, as everyone is using the damn thing as of late. You try on chain and it costs you $15. You ask your friend and they say use a Lightning Network, because it's cheap. Or maybe your wallet is smart enough to offer LN as soon as you install it. You pay another $15 in fee to setup a channel to your friend and lock your $500 in that channel. And you are done for life, as long as you don't need to send or receive more than $500. That's an oversimplification, but that's how it's supposed to feel.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:25:12
In short, transactions are signed by both parties and can be broadcast to the blockchain at any moment. Both parties verify them by checking signatures, there is no confirmation needed (they are instant), only when the channel closes, which could happen after 1000 transactions went through.
Addresses are completely different, one cannot send to lightning thinking it's on chain. Most likely wallets will upgrade their functionality and allow to send both lightning and regular transactions depending on what one needs at the moment.

I will be running a lightning hub and so can you and everyone else. Risks are low if you commit small amount of BTC to a channel. You can even earn something, so there is a financial incentive, not only altruism.
And lightning actually increases privacy, because it uses tor routing. No ips, no nothing. It's more difficult to regulate than bitcoin mining.

I don't buy it. It will "solve" problems for 3 months and then what? We need a good solution and not a "can down the road". This increase is good for nothing, and it is a hardfork.
We've waited a year for SegWit, waiting another 6 month for LN is nothing, given we have ~2mb already.

Right, but the one spamming is also paying for it by loosing legit transactions and paying fees to other miners from time to time, thus it's unclear if it is at all profitable.

@_date: 2017-08-18 10:20:26
I want to make it clear that I'm 100% pro LN as a best peace of tech in bitcoin we have right now.
Those are potential problems:
1. You have to monitor blockchain all the time or you have to delegate that responsibility (without sharing private keys) to someone in case your channel mate wants to trick you by broadcasting the old state.
2. A third party can block your funds for some time by requesting to open the channel and stop responding. It's especially risky for intermediary nodes. By doing that a third party will loose some money on fees, however.
3. If you want to earn money on LN fees and become an intermediary node, you risk loosing money if you go offline for a long time due to tech failure or ddos. That can be metigated by delegating this responsibility, but you'll have to share your private keys to some of your funds.
4. It is unclear who must pay the fees for opening the channel and for closing it. Some people think the less trusted party must do that. But that will create the market of reputation and will deanonymize the intermediaries.
5. Most people see the future with big intermediary nodes (exchanges, wallets) with huge funds providing services for regular users. That will centralize the network, giving those nodes powers we do not yet understand.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:44:50
SegWit effectively increases blocksize. People forget about that, so it's already providing a temporary solution before LN without the need for a hardfork.

Anyone with good amount of funds and good uptime (dedicated server, for example) will be able to run intermediary node and earn fees. I doubt it will be the same big players, because they are already late in the game.
Centralization is a viable concern, but LN still has great advantages over system we have today. To name the one, those people cannot actually block your funds, because you are "untrustworthy". They can only deny you a channel, but you can always route around them. So they won't really hold so much power.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:37:48
We see a lot of transactions already, great fraction of them being spam. To provide service to 7 bln people with 2 transactions a year for each, you need GBs blocks.
That is just the matter of time before blocks become full. And spammers will have greater incentive with reduced fees.

It would be nice to live in the world where everything is free, but unfortunately we aint there yet.

Intermediaries set their own fees, your wallet routes through them and chooses the path with lower fees.
Opening PayPal+ channel will cost you regular bitcoin transaction fee. But you will use that channel a lot in the future, because a lot of people will be connected to PayPal+, presumably.
Intermediaries do not have their own mempool, they have personal channel for everyone they are connected to, no blocks are generated, because all the transactions are virtual until the channel is closed.

You cannot have a trustless system without verifying everything by yourself. What you are proposing is a pseudo-cryptocurrency with multiple possible attack vectors. And who will distribute the code with those hashes, I wonder? Another trusted authority? Banks would like that I'm sure.

A number of trusted hashes is still that number less safe than one. Despite, prunning already does what you're trying to do. You just need to validate everything the first time.
It all came down to personal preferences. With all those idiots saying that "bitcoin is not based on anything" I think we should really emphasize what gives it value. In my opinion it is temper-proofness and security, not amount of tps. People would choose visa for that long ago. If we can somehow give more tps without loosing those core values or making compromises with them, that would be nice, but if not, better not touch it at all. There will be a proper tech sooner or later, things take time, good things take good amount of one.

What you are not taking into consideration is the randomness of that process. If you were sending 1000 transactions and all of them got included into the first block with 0.00013 BTC fee, despite txconfirmtarget=200, I would suspect something is fishy. But right now, only that logic you use is clearly broken. You cannot draw conclusions from just one sample in random processes, one example of which is transactions getting included into a block.
BTW, calculating average fees across (much more than) 1000 transactions confirming in the next two blocks is what your wallet does when you set txconfirmtarget=20.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:27:31
Yes, if you cannot validate the whole blockchain yourself you cannot trust anyone for the validity of the current block and the validity of the utxo hash and sets.
What if I set up a node that will distribute an arbitrary long chain of false blocks (it's not difficult, because you do not know the difficulty, no pun intended) with false utxo hashes and sets. I can trick you into thinking I payed 1MLN BTC when the only thing I have in reality is a donut's hole.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:38:02
Nothing straightforward I guess.
One think is you can lend capital to big players in case they experience a shortage, but want to continue operating to save reputation and earn fees. They will probably run an ICO in such case.
Another one. Lightning nodes must be online all the time to mitigate unfair moves from counter-parties. Thus you can invest into outsourcing providers and earn gains from them. Or you may develop and run outsourcing server yourself.

If you have bitcoins locked in a channel you must monitor a blockchain once in a while (once a week for example, but that can be negotiated when creating a channel based on your risk assessment) to make sure your peer is not cheating. If you cannot do that (e.g. going for vacation) you risk loosing funds. It can be mitigated by delegating this responsibility for a third party (your wallet or another specialized entity) without even sharing your private keys.
When you run an intermediary node, on the other hand, you must do the same, but you have to share you private keys with that responsible entity if you are using one. If you are already doing that by using online wallet, that is not a problem, but if not, you may not want to trust anyone. But if you go offline for a week or so, or if someone will ddos you out of the network, you may loose your funds to the cheating counter-party. Thus, you need a good uptime, possibly a server, or you will have to trust a third party, which limits possible candidates for intermediary nodes.
Another possible reason is the amount of funds. As your funds get locked in a channel, intermediary nodes may need a lot of them to sustain multiple open channels. It is another limiting factor.
Thus, people theoretize that only big corps will run intermediary nodes. That said, intermediary nodes earn fees for their services, which is a compensation for the risks they take. The larger those fees become the more nodes we'll see. And it is advised to open small amounts channels only, which can mitigate risks and make less prohibitive to run an intermediary node. Additionally LN game theory punishes any attacker by confiscating their funds, if the counter-person is on guard.
And after all, LN centralization is not such a severe problem, comparing with miners' one we have today. They cannot steal funds or deny blocks. Uncooperative nodes can always be routed around, effectively denying them fees and punishing them. We cannot do that with miners today. We should always keep vigilance nevertheless, as there could be unanticipated dangers in giving power to someone. But there is always backup 1st layer left for everyone.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:37:46
Regular people may not have enough funds or deem it too risky to operate an intermediary node. Those could be scarce and will earn good profits for their work.
That sounds as likely as what you've said. That's why I'm asking for a proof.

Easy, it takes days to download the chain **now**, that's why blocks have a limit **today**.

tl; dr: Do not run a node because we need big blocks and you are a problem with your crappy non-specialized hardware. Whitepaper says so.

@_date: 2017-08-20 12:16:10
It is possible to top up your channel in LN, but your particular implementation may not allow it. Usually your wallet and the node you're connected to will have to create new refund transactions and then you'll send money to a new multisig address, you'll have to wait as when you were opening the new channel, but it's still better than closing the existing one and opening the new one.

And you pay everyone you need to pay during the month through PayPal+channel, because there is a route from you to everyone through PayPal+.

Verification can be done in the background on a regular PC. It's about how fast you can start mining new block. If you skip downloading witness data you can start, say, 1 sec, faster and gain an advantage over other miners. But that way you can build on top of a bad block, if you never verified it.
Non-mining full nodes do not accept or propogate bad blocks, so using this for funds theft is out of the question. It can lead to chain split in the worst case and loss of funds by miners, who mined bad block or on top of bad block, which I think is fair, since they took a risk by skipping verification.

I open, say, 10 channels a year, then route 1000 transaction during that year through those channels, then I close those 10 channels (not necessarily). For 20 transactions on the blockchain I have 1000 in channels, thus obtaining x50 multiplier. It is as if blocks were 50 mb large, while taking just 1 mb of storage and bandwidth.
And what if I don't close those channels? What if I send 10000 transactions through them (buying that notorious coffee)?

My reasoning about poor investment is when you have money always loosing their value you will gladly greet any instrument bringing profits, undervaluing the risks. When you now that you will not lose anything by simply holding to your savings, you will be more careful in choosing where to invest.
An example from personal experience, the currency in my country devalued nearly twice compared to USD in half a year, with no drastic political or economic changes. Now I know that keeping paper money is not wise, starting a business is not an option with my small income and I have to resort to either risky investments or simply wasting. Now, is that a healthy financial environment?

You are kind of contradicting yourself, don't you think? If there is no "real" value then any price is a bubble. And why should bitcoin grow further if it only can be hedl and have rare niche usages?
In my opinion, bitcoin is going to replace fiat eventually and will have all its usages with better properties, that's why it has a real value and that's why the price we see right now is not a bubble.
Housing bubble did not come because of abundance of housing, they would be cheap in that case, but because of overvaluation and high need. Shortage does not make something valuable as well, it should have other characteristics that will make it valuable. There are other coins that are worth nothing, even though they come in small supply.

You can palm your face as long as you want, but that's what blockchain is. It has additional properties, other than storing data, which quickly disappear when you take decentralized security model away. That's what all those "we're for the blockchain, not bitcoin" corporations do not get. If you just have 10 master-nodes better just use a database, it's much more efficient.
It is always a tradeoff between security, decentralization, speed and so on. They have DAGs, but those are only subjectively secure, they have fast private chains, but they're no better than old trusted ledgers, privacy-coins are frustratingly slow, and so on. There is no coin that has the same properties as bitcoin and something extra. 
No dummies here, hundreds of talented developers, investing miners and millions of users would not spend their time on something outdated.

No he can't. He actually owns Bitmain behind Jihan and that's why they have the monopoly in the first place.
People say he can give you the correct nounce just by looking at the block and we should be grateful he doesn't really give a shit about mining as he already owns 22 million bitcoins.

Source? I don't know of any widely adopted deflationary currency. Please, do not quote Dark Ages, because economic growth could not be measured back then and productivity was awful. They simply could not have 2% growth with that.
History has definitely proved that blind and abundant investment leads to overvaluation of goods and bubble forming (2008 housing bubble with CDOs and the dire need for at least some instrument to invest into).
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:29:55
Not necessarily. Imagine it appreciates in value by 1% a year, no one will bother hording it. And cash must not loose it's value, it is like that by a (crooked) design right now.
What is wrong with medium of exchange being resistant to inflation? Wouldn't people be more prudent in what they spend their money on? Wouldn't they invest more wisely? Wouldn't that keep all the financial bubbles at bay?
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:20:05
In the early stages of adoption price increases exponentially and HODL thing is relevant, bitcoin is better as a store of value.
Later on, price increments will not be as dramatic and people will start spending more.

Hash rate consensus was deemed a good tool to prevent Sybil. No one anticipated centralization we have today though. It is screwed for now.
Economic consensus is when on the 1st of August major exchanges, wallets and other nodes will or will not follow the UASF chain. It is possible to gauge. You just go to your major exchange and see which chain it's trading. If there is a chainsplit, I hope there isn't.
The number of nodes signalling right now is irrelevant, but they provide a start. The process has to start somewhere, we cannot just sit on our asses and wait for Coinbase et al to announce UASF support.
SegWit doesn't change consensus rules, next update could be done through MASF or whatever rule we have at the moment. It's a technical staff, it doesn't change anything in the community protocols. UASF however does create a precedent and future updates could only be enrolled through similar process because of overwhelming support. But miners are the ones to blame for that, not developers or UASF supporters, they screwed up the previous rule for their economic advantage and that's why people will stop trusting them in the future, not because of devs conspiracy or what not.
I don't give a damn about devs either, as far as I'm concerned they're providing support right now. But I judge on individual basis. As soon as they start to behave akin to miners, they can go and fuck themselves. There's no way they can influence economic or hashrate consensus, thus they'll become irrelevant.

It doesn't matter. In satoshis it's the same. The system is closed, if fee raises in terms of one other currency, it doesn't mean anything for the system. It means for people, so they (not only wallets, but all participants) should reduce fees in satoshis. Since it's not happening, the market says fees in fiat must rise, whatever the reason is.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:27:01
Because if the exchange uses US bank it's US-US transfer. But if it's Korean bank it's Korea-Intl transfer and they will flag your account after you transfer some average amount, say $10000.

I think it's a very bad idea. I'm not familiar with your situation, but if you don't have savings to invest right now, you'll probably have a hard time repaying the credit with just what you earn. Brutally honest, sorry)
And investing a large amount at any given time is not a good strategy anyway... unless of course you are a sophisticated market trader (as if they even exist ;)... which I think you are not. Brutally honest, sorry) You don't know where the market goes next and no one knows. It can crush now and stay like that for 1.5 years. If you listen to emotions and sell then, you have a great loss to repay. If you hodl, you'll have to pay your debts with your earnings only, which I think is not a good idea for you.
Better strategy is to use dollar averaging, it'll save you from market dips and hikes. And quite conveniently, you don't have to take credit for that. Just squeeze your belt and invest as much as you can every month. It will pay off anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:31:01
I think the next thing to expect is they'll create a new coin called 1Coin or something and sell all the people's funds into it at an artificially hiked up fixed rate, like 1800 USD to 1, telling them "OK, we've fulfilled our promises. Now you're on your own. Fly, our children, fly!", vanishing into the blue...
No need to mention that the rate will go down to 0.3 USD to 1 the next day.
What keeps me puzzled is why people are willing to invest in such crap instead of putting money into the original crypto? I think it's beyond anyone's understanding.

The same applies to banks as well, they want to make money, and they even undergo govt regulations. But we have bailouts nevertheless because of mismanagement and simple fraud. That's the problems with centralized governing that I call a "bank scheme".
What they are trying to do is run on this crypto bubble attracting the money from misinformed investors. No one can stop them to bailout their friends the same way in the future, or print fresh new XRP out of the air. I'm personally not dealing with that staff, because their "technology" is not a worth pile of shit, it's not decentralized and all just up to their "promise".
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:08:30
Wallets are looking for the minimum fee to get into blockchain by analyzing history. Unless they are shitwallets, ofc. If they say fees are such and such it means you'll not get confirmed if you pay less. And a good wallet always allows you to set fee manually if you think you know better and want to risk your time.
Backlog size doesn't mean anything because there could be 100k transaction with zero fee which will never end up in a chain, ie spam.
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:26:54
I agree, I think it's good time to invest as well. But the price seems too unstable to buy in one big drought. It just dropped 100$ in a day just to confirm my words) It seems a good time to buy my 100$ share now, btw...
And yeah, ETH seems nice as well, but I'm in doubts about its future applicability. It's so technical and people can just ignore it. Again, one may never know...
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:26:17
Also if you go Mycelium try creating many additional addresses, because you won't know which one blockchain.info used to receive your funds. I think 20 will be enough. Also, Mycelium shows you the actual adresses-public-keys, so you can check every one individually to see if they contained any funds before. There's still a possibility that you were hacked, you know.
Also, try contacting blockchain.info support. Do not provide them with your passphrase though, just describe the situation.
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:14:20
It's not a fork btw, it's a chainsplit.
If there're just miners on "the other chain" it's worth nothing. He'll not be able to even exchange his "shitcoins".
If there're two viable chains with economy in both of them, they'll be worth less than half of the original coin. Because speculators will sell like there's no tomorrow. He knows that, otherwise he would have split already.

I think you should propose a new fee choosing algorithm then, that will work for everyone spontaneously, without them discussing anything or conspiring.
Right now they rely on good old "I buy the cheapest" open market solution. I fail to see how this could be mitigated. Sorry.
EDIT: If there were a wallet with lesser fees that work just as good I would be switching tomorrow!
EDIT: Bitcoin price does not influence fees btw, it's set in satoshis.

If there's enough users and wallets and exchanges signalling it, then no, miners will have to signal SegWit as well. If there's more than 50% of miners signalling SegWit the legacy chain will be killed pretty soon.
If there isn't, there could be a chain split, resulting in two bitcoins. That's why we need as many nodes enforcing UASF now, exchanges and wallets will follow, because 90% of economic users want SegWit, they are just not sure about UASF right now. Miners will not have any choice then, they had their say but blew up everything.
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:38:59
The problem is they want to lock BOTH SegWit and HF. It means no pullback later no matter what. HF not afterwards somewhere but locked in on some date.

@_date: 2017-05-24 04:46:28
Fees are not determined by wallets. The market decides. If people want to pay high fees and compete for the next block, it says "Here you go".
I personally pay minimum reasonable fees to get into chain sooner or later. The current state is not good for insta-micro-payments.
Support UASF if you want Lightning and insta-payments.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:29:03
It's Joe's problem, not our's. He should know better what he's accepting as money.
Any update discourages older node, it's inevitable. HF will make old nodes obsolete. Don't see how this is any better.

It's better than this 1-miner-veto stalemate. And in the worst case at least one of the chains gets SegWit.
They can do whatever they want with their chain after that, maybe 10 datacenter nodes and 1 miner pool. They're so wishing for this power, so let them take it. We'll see now many users will want BU Bank 3.0

"Nodes != Users". I know that, you said that more users will bring more nodes.
"Only merchants need to verify payments". If it happens at any time in the future, bitcoin will lose it's decentralized nature and great part of its value.
"fees limit users" -- that's the cost of using the technology right now. Blocksize increase will limit users as well, and will limit everyone else's trust in the system. If there's just 100 datacenters running the nodes across the country, I will not be using bitcoin any longer. They all can be put down in a day.

@_date: 2017-05-26 02:43:08
The first entire part. We don't want datacenters, that's the point. Also, I am not interested in bitcoin vs every other coin. And including price in your calculations is lame. Price can go up and down.


I know, but I'll try to squeeze by, maybe will have to run a pruned node. 8 mb will kill me.


Exactly what you said to me, it's your perception.


Never proposed that anywhere. I'm discussing what is happening and what should happen, realistically.


~90% of nodes running core with SegWit code in it. Also people can support multiple proposals. Everything must not add up to 100%.


The situation you described is an attack or technical failure. It must go-chain in that case, because the channel is closed.


It's the other way around, Alice pays Bob, Bob pays Carol, Carol pays Dave. It all remains off-chain if they all push R successfully.


If people fail to take their money back. But why would they?


Wallets are free right now. They are likely to remain so. But Bob is free to not use Lighting and pay high fees for on-chain.


That's what some of us are doing now with wallets. Which is still not necessary, because outsourcing in that case can be done without entrusting private key.
He can additionally run everything from home, but that's the risk of going offline. It's his choice.


It does not, only routing centers will want to become intermediaries, those exchanges, wallets, etc. And they must have fail-prevention to ensure customers support. Regular user Bob will have an option to do the same to get fees, but that's the risk he's willingly taking. Or he'll probably want to just maintain his bidirectional channel to Coinbase or whatnot and remain risk-free, as I will do.


You seem to have some prejudices) We don't know that yet. But even if it all fails and most transaction will go on-chain we'll essentially have the same situation we have right now. But internet works nevertheless, and no one can still your funds on Lightning no matter in which country they are. No signs for it to fail, actually, software works the same even in shady countries. And they have financial incentive to operate honestly, unless they want to hamper bitcoin in exchange for their money. Yes, it costs money, because the failing side pays fees.


That's underestimation, I pay more for my crappy 200 gb per month now. More like $10000 a year.

Not exactly bitcoin, but something similar, with added features as needed, like tracking, identification, etc. And it will be independent, truly international currency.

It will never have the required support without you personally. SegWit now is the only rational solution to the scalability problem. If a bunch of miners think they can block what most of the users want, we must prove them wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:11:29

Blockexplorer sees it, blockchain.info is not relaying anymore, for whatever the reason is. The tx started today, so it shouldn't be purged yet.
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:47:55


Don't see any point here. That's why we have community averaging to compensate.
Bitcoin must scale, everyone agrees on that. I've calculated that with 8mb blocks I'll not be able to run a node. I think it's a pseudo-scaling solution. If only 100 datacenters run nodes people behind them will make all the decisions about bitcoin. We already see that today with mining.


When it starts to we can discuss blocksize increase again, if there's no better solution at that time. We cannot solve all of the problems at once, it only work in ads.


Not ready to comment on that. Will have to research first.


They will to keep system working, because they believe in it and keep money there. As long as it doesn't require heavy investment. I can spare $2000 for that now, because bitcoin was very kind to me. But $10000 Jihan proposes is outrageous. If he really cares about decentralization he should've invested his money in building a light-weight cheap node to run 8mb blockchain and then push for HF. It seems his only concern is his financial well-being, though.


People are desperate to get code that ~90% of players support and one guy blocks for whatever his reasons are. When they are, they start acting. Compromise is beyond the reach now.
I want to share my philosophical view as well. I think SegWit is a one-step solution. We can do it without major disruptions and see what happens. Then we can do the next step. What people in the BU crowd want is a silver-bullet one-line-fixes-all solution, like Emergent Consensus.
I think people in general are very bad to predict what will happen after drastic changes, thus the experiment is very dangerous and have a potential to disrupt the whole system. An example to explain my point: It's not good to quickly change societies with technologies. It will only make things worse, given the mentality of people hasn't changes. I see that now in my country. And you can see that in Syria for example.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:51:25
If you pump it once, it will create a precedent. Next time people will not ask what to do and will not be looking for alternative solutions. They will pump it even more.
To get to full adoption even 128mb blocksize is not enough. So why even go that way and not think ahead of times? To simply add twice the amount of users? To simply pump the price twice? It's not a long-term solution.
But at 128mb I'll not be able to run a node, nor will you, ending up with a new bank system run by 100 nodes across the country.

Let's say you have 5TH/s on that hardware. You'll make your 1000 back in ~200 days if the difficulty stays the same: 
If it increases 3 times right now though (usually happens in a year or so), you'll need ~600 days: 
I'd say somewhere around 500 days or so. Is not worth it imho, considering the fact that your hardware becomes outdated by that time or may simply break.

If you look at mining, one day it could be done on a simple CPU chip. But now, no one sees it ever returning to that or similar (when unsophisticated user can do it) state. It became highly centralized, because of a centralized chips production. The same can happen to node running, because of the hardware requirements of the blocksize increase. First it will be squeezed out into expensive PCs, then datacenters, and then specialized nodes. And it will never return, because a regular user will never have specialized hardware (as with mining).

I don't care about politics. I judge for myself. I read SegWit docks, BU proposal, pros and cons. Then I make a decision. And I'm not any smarter than an average Joe.
From your perspective there's no point in making any decision at all, since every party must have a hidden agenda and there's no community consensus, but only the lobotomized zombie crowd.
EDIT: And we've started from who must write the code, remember?
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:29:24
I agree. Malicious intentions should be circumvented. That's what i said.
Don't really follow your point with ETH/ETC controversy though. UASF is a desperate move, no one supported it as a main solution. It is almost the same as with DAO fork, this time the bad intent is that of some miners. And reasons to believe UASF will work are the same, community support basically.
I don't see any trouble with minority chain existing as well. I genuinely think it will be BU, but who knows. Someone has spent a lot of effort to polarize the issue, there's no reconciliation on the horizon. If it is the split, then split it be.

@_date: 2017-05-24 04:58:27
Yeah, you can post your propaganda of BU and other poorly written nodes exactly because "this subreddit is heavily cen$ored".
Don't forget to mention that "Bitpay CEO and miners and Chinese dudes" have a direct financial incentives to push blocksize increase. And core has none for SegWit.
And also mention that "buying coffee" will still not be feasible with reasonable blocksize increase and fees will remain almost the same.
And also mention that user will not actually be able to run any nodes at all if we start on this HF-blocksize-increase madness.
And also mention that "Bitpay CEO and miners and Chinese dudes" are the only people blocking the "buying coffee" solution, which is SegWit, despite overwhelming economic support.
How convenient that you forgot all of those.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:34:02
It's easier to reach consensus when one party controls a lot. That's why people hiss at ETH.
If less than 20% will support UASF chain after activation it will die. The idea behind UASF is that since 80% support SegWit they will support UASF and miners will follow. It can be wrong, but there's nothing wrong with trying. It's not an minority enforced solution, because support for SegWit is there, right. 20% right now, but there's still time.
Agree with you about RSK. I was talking bitcoin only.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:18:26
If you do 4/8 mb block now, there's even less chance of seeing SegWit at all. Who says miners will start signalling and will not want "yet another increase"? And you'll squeeze regular nodes out, leaving more centralized ones with their corporate agenda. And more centralized miners as well because of memory and verification requirements.
4/8 mb now is only good for speculators who want to get a quick buck from excellent news and get out on the next station. It will run out of puff in several months and the same exact problem will arise. There's no reason to do that in the long run, it just moves the problem farther away. A long run solution is off-chain scaling, that's what we should be advocating for. Now and not tomorrow.

They don't care about value as long as they make the profit, it's capitalism. Their "good intentions" are out of the question. BTC fork is precluded by people not wanting to lose money, but if someone can easily print themselves another 60b coins, the incentive is not there anymore.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:51:40
What a strange discussion, indeed. My point is they cannot cooperate to reduce fees. Market says fees should increase and that's what happening.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:16:36
Well, at least the Ethereum team had a decency to premine just 1/6 of the overall supply. And they still have decentralized operation, anyone can run a node or mine. So there's at least some kind of protection against protocol change in the future.
Vitalik is still the benevolent dictator out there, though.

Had to do a lot of reading with your linking)


People behind them do. And if govt won't support bitcoin, individuals and companies will have to run them. Additionally, taking out 1 node in a country is too easy for anyone dedicated. Nodes should be everywhere for the system to be resilient.


You've made multiple points about price, it's a bad logic. System must work no matter if the price is increasing or decreasing. Otherwise it's a pyramid scheme.


That's not a full node then. And I'm capped at 200gb per month. Oops.


I call it sharing. That's why we're here on reddit. AS if you're not "imposing" anything, are you?


I only discuss bitcoin and how to make it better. I don't care about prices as well.


It was not supposed to have 1 actor with 20% hashrate. If that actor acts counter to majority's desire, majority must stop him. That's what we are trying to do.


By Jihan Wu obviously, the only reasonable actor out there. He's heroically saving bitcoin from reckless 90% majority. If Bob has problems with everyone maybe the only problem is Bob.


Blocking the desirable upgrade to push your ideas is not seeking compromise. It's holding community ransom.


Ready to comment on that. As I understand the problem you've described, Bob doesn't get R and looses his payment from Alice. If Bob suddenly goes offline and does not receive R from Carol he just waits for Dave to broadcast R on the blockchain, which happens before his payment from Alice expires. Then he uses R to get his money.
EDIT: waits for Dave [more like Carol, since she's taking his money] to broadcast R on the blockchain. If she doesn't broadcast before his contract expires, she's not taking any of his money.
If Bob goes offline hard, like for really long time, he should have used outsourcing to finalize that payment. In other words his wallet will do it for him. There's still risk, because wallet and all its servers can go down as well, but that's the risk Bob was willing to accept, when he became intermediary, and that's what he's getting his fees for.

You may also try to find traces on your computer. Try searching through your disk and registry for "bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:54:44
Miners will not go for that. It's obvious. They want simultaneous lock in for both SegWit and 2mb HF. Which is insane, since it's a completely new deployment incompatible with BIP141 and a lot of testing is necessary.
I think Jihan wants to somehow bootstrap his HF on the overall SegWit activation euphoria. And who's gonna write the code I wonder? Roger's shithand programmers? No thank you.
Keep calm and support UASF!

We're talking about community consensus rule, not technical side of bitcoin. Hashrate is good enough for tech because miners don't have 50% advantage yet and don't behave. Community hash is screwed because one person gets a veto.
Economic consensus can be gauged, I've already explained that. You hold major players for idiots, they can decide for themselves. If they don't know technical details, they must educate themselves to continue doing business in bitcoin. Pick up a weapon if everyone is firing around, so to say...
SegWit does not change anything, most of the updates came as soft forks before.

It should start with something. If there's enough nodes signalling, then exchanges will follow. And miners?.. they'll have to in the end.

1.6 - 2mb on average estimated, which is still far from 4mb block. And it opens possibilities for off-chain scaling, solving multiple issues, including humongous tx ddos possible with extended blocks.
Those who don't want it can still run old nodes with 1mb cap.
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:25:30
Some things that may be responsible:
1. Continuing BTC/BTU aka SegWit/ExtBlk controversy.
2. US Govt may add up fire by overregulating.
3. One of the major exchanges crushes, taking user funds with it. Seems likely, since their number increased, but the impact will not be as profound as with Gox.
4. A good old panic of the market, when everyone decide it's the top and try to quit.

Other coins taking up is bad discussion, we need to concentrate on how to make bitcoin better, not get ahead of other coins making a lot of bad decisions in the process.
Again, I don't want to look into datacenters costs, because I'll not be running one. There are few of them for a reason, they are costly. We basically disagree on the point, if a datacenter-only-node is a bad thing or not, nothing can change my or your view on such a basic issue.


Ok, how about this: 


Now I'm asking for evidence.


You don't want to understand, obviously. He is NOT an average user, because he became a willing intermediary, meaning he's the one to make sure he accounted for risks. It becomes a useless discussion if you keep coming up with shitty reason, despite me already explaining that very point.


Bob has his own brain. Maybe I'll tell him to give me money, will he?


Yes, I'm not sure but I think you're right on that one. Bob will have to stay online or give his private key to a third party if he wants to be an intermediary because of the R. It's not required for regular users though.


Yes, you need a datacenter to run an intermediary node in Lightning I'm afraid. I'll still be running my regular one without becoming intermediary though, keeping the chain safe. And if Coinbase starts to behave, I'll just block it and use other nodes. We cannot block miners in the meantime.


How so? It can suddenly obtain their private keys, defining cryptography, because of all the shadiness in the country?


How cute that we don't need that with bitcoin, as it's a trustless system. Lightning does not disable that basic property.


Yeah, that's what we all do in our shady countries. On a regular basis. No, fees, you dummy.
I have a proposal. Let's concentrate on a small number of issues in the future. Posts are becoming too large. I think datacenter, centralization, bitcion price, competition from shitcoins, Jihan's intentions are better be left untouched. I've started from who must write the code for blocksize increase HF, core or not core.

It also allows for off-chain transactions, decreasing the transaction bandwidth to the nodes.

Miners' fear of SegWit resides on the fact that once off-chain scaling is fully embraced they will never have 300-400 satoshi per byte of fees again. They anticipate the next halving and scared to loose income.
They support blocksize increase on the other hand, because it will basically allow x-times as many transactions, meaning x-times less fee per transaction with their income remaining the same. They don't really care about centralization or govt control because their income is primal for them. They don't care what users want for the same reason.
Miners basically have economic incentive to oppose SegWit, and it's there (unintentionally) by design. Mining centralization does not change that. Only responsible and far-seeing miners support SegWit now, other are just acting on selfish reasons and cannot be persuaded to do otherwise.
There're a lot of talk about ASICBOOST as well, but most people talking don't understand how it works. I don't want to be one of them)

CEX.IO is one of the cheapest with debit/credit, but they have a price premium. It's very reliable, withdrawals go in seconds.
btc-e.com allows you to fund through third parties that accept credit/debit. Namely, advcash. They have a 24h withdrawals grace period though, if funding through "unreliable sources". Their low prices compensate the third party's fee.
exmo.com is the same, but without grace. And it looks a little bit shady overall. A lot of issues, but every one of them got resolved so far.

It can go up to 4 if it consists entirely of witness data. Which will not happen most of the time. Thus, 1.6 - 2mb **on average**. And it's still a better solution than 2-8 mb block with no off-chain scaling and without other issues resolved, like efficiency and malleability.

They enjoy having a lot of fees now. No one wants to give it away for free. Don't forget about upcoming ASICBOOST fix after SegWit, which is another incentive to oppose it.
And they have the upper hand knowing exactly when the Segwit will activate, keeping everyone else in the dark. That way they can accumulate bitcoins while price is low and then suddenly announce they will SegWit and cash in on the difference in literally 1 day.
