500k is a lotttt of money,  most people earn less than 20k a year in europe and  30k if they're lucky.

Really?  Fuck america then,  you also have to pay for your medical bills... 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:59:27
Depending on you city (not london probably) ,  but if you live alone 3k a month is not bad at all.    I was living in the center of a big city in a studio for a while with a flatmate and we paid 500€ each,  in an amazing location.

I agree with the other comment,  Bitcoin may have been the trigger but I'd bet that he already had suicidal thoughts at some point not related to bitcoin or at least had some slight depression. 
  Unfortunately we are told that money is everything in life,  and the entire point of living is to make lots of money otherwise you won't be living life to the fullest,  so when this doesn't work out we feel stupid, like a failure and can lead to depression,  while I agree that money is important to survive in our society it's not everything in life,  as you can be poor and miserable or rich and miserable and vis versa.  I'm sorry for your loss,  I understand what he might have been through,  I often get those thoughts when lost in life.

If you only have 1Bitcoin I don't think you'll have enough to retire.

Yeah but that graph is over decades

So he has like 76000 bitcoins? 
Edit: typo

10k finally!!!  Such a big milestone for the community!

Change bank.

This downvoting clearly reflects why Bitcoin has become a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:58:33
Makes me sick that everyone is in crypto just to get rich. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:05:42
Because nobody cares about what crypto has to offer to  the world,  they are just in so one day they can cash out to buy something fancy.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:50:56
Its not
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:52:24
Maybe bitcoin will be the new gold that's why its hard to see right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:59:33
Yesterday I'll show you that we can! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:51:36
Its not,  transactions are traceble.  Monero is what you're looking for. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:57:09
You are right,  I bought my first bitcoin today,  I know it was expensive but if the price goes more than 10k I'm afraid that I wont be able to buy one anymore,  I'm ready for the value of my bitcoin to lose 80℅ of value if it happens,  if it does I'll buy more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:20:26
The question is "will it hit 10000€ in 2018"
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:54:28
Exactly it's like people making fun of the guy that bought the pizza for 10.000 bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:55:57
If bitcoin becomes too powerful governments can always ban it.  Thats why some buy gold instead. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:52:26
Kraken,  bitfinex
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:36:58
Kraken is a bit shit but does the job and is in Euros
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:28:31
I knowwwww and I was buying btc progressively until it was going up like crazy,  I got emotional I guess instead of following my strategy.  We learn from mistakes :) 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:39:57
Move them to your trezor for example and it will do it for you
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:51:47
I use onepassword but never knew that feature. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:09:09
In another reality you held until the price was 1Billion per coin.  So be happy. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:37:10
No but there will be a correction at some point and no one knows how big it will be or when.

@_date: 2017-11-07 17:55:22
Same here,  i tried a while ago to buy bitcoin when it was 200 or 400 cant remember but coinbase only accepted US credit cards so i gave up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:37:26
The couple of cents I had on my coinbase account from 2015 are now worth 2.50€ feel rich. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:22:34
You just might. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:50:15
It's not that hard to sell it for fiat and transfer it to your account. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:26:07
What the actual fuck
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:52:55
But financial institutions are making tools for that actually 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:02:27
Maybe the early adopters were people with time machines. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:26:15
It excites me to be part of some growing tech movement that could become a revolution,  I wish I could contribute more tho. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:04:15
So what??  Apple was worth nothing and going bankrupt and now its almost worth a trillion,  we get it! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:42:14
You can purchase 0.000001 of a bitcoin if you want
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:37:20
If you transfered money to an exchange with credit card or bank transfer they already know,  if you bought in a ATM maybe they don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:30:39
Seems like a nazi movie,  please tell me this isnt true
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:42:59
Yeah :(
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:22:14
I have 1 as well
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:50:08
Well me too, i don't care if I lose that money,  it's just disturbing that I chose the worse time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:44:41
There is actually no proof that the tulip bubble ever happened,  just one guy wrote about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:22:03
I bought my first bitcoin at the highest it ever got because I was afraid it was gonna keep climbing to like 10k and wouldn't be able to afford one anymore but then they canceled the fork and I lost 1k in 3days, I'm kinda scared to be honest but I'm not selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:04:24
Depends,  if you buy it on the stock market sure but if you just buy it in a gold store and store it in a bank safe.  Plus its harder to steal 10kg of gold than a 24word string.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:28:10
Sure some places around the world it will be always legal but if my country bans bitcoins what am I gonna do?  Prentend I don't have any and hope that they don't know?  Or turn them in? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:52:09
You can
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:10:22
I'd only sell if I need the money or if the money I would get by selling is life changing. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:33:31
That's not comparable at all
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:37:05
He gave it to charity
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:00:07
Even for me that i bought in october everyone was telling me to sell when it crashed but i never did,  I actually dont ever want to sell and keep it for like as long as I can. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:13:46
I dont think you read the article correctly,  from my google search the only similar article that mentioned MS and 10B is about Morgan Stanley starting Bitcoin futures and they estimate that investors will put around 10Billion$ in those futures. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:07:40
I regret not hearing about it before,  I was a tech nerd and always watching high tech news I dont know how I missed on it,  I heard how it was used for buying drugs but thats about it,  I went to see the old posts of people talking about it on the forums back in 2011 and those were the kind of forums I was into at the time,  feels bad but maybe I'd have sold way to early like most.
