At the end Coinbase only concern was that the recipient was me and they confirmed the btc address belonged to me. Next step was just to transfer the funds to my new coinbase account. I would have expected the to return the funds to the sender and let them make the decision.

I probably could prove that i paid a company who in return bought bitcoins and send it to that account. Its a completely transparent and legit transaction. I am not gonna name the company involved as it will be very bad for their business.

The bitcoins now sitting here  [
This is the kind of reply I am getting from coinbase:
 
Thank you for contacting Coinbase. As Coinbase experiments with expanding into more markets, there will be varying levels of support provided. Initially, Coinbase will only offer **self-help** customer support in your region.

I fully agree and if they tell me money is lost due to my negligence then I would accept it but I am hoping that there is an element of humanity left in this world so i can recover the funds.

They had to have kept them since they moved the funds

I emailed, tweeted, insta, reddit Dm'ed and posted here... Please if anyone has got other means of getting a human to connect with (from coinbase) please let me know?

I had two accounts with them I specifically received payment for the one account which had the correct btc address associated with it. 
Unfortunately the money receiving on that account was paid to the other accounts btc address. They should be responsible for sorting it out but I very much doubt they can or will reimburse me. I understand the confusion in retrospect but blindly paying that kind of money with any verification is just irresponsible in my view.

Thank you. I Dm'ed them

I tried.. created a new account but obviously no history or addresses from previous account with the same email.

My guess is that the way coinbase operates is that your addresses are not really yours but managed by coinbase so when you receive a payment on an address like i did on  [1KMTyBxEPPTs2oZHEShg3N9DqPnxUo1FRT](  then they move it to their cold storage wallet and just update their internal accounting system to reflect the balance. 
They got the key for this account otherwise they wouldn't be able to move the funds. 
But it the movement pattern consistent with how coinbase operates ? 
Any idea of what else I can do ?

not true.. the coins moved. Coinbase has access to the private keys of all accounts.

Thanks.I am guessing those offices are like fort knox. My sister stays close to the new york office so maybe she can get the ball rolling

I agree with regards to it being my error however a billion dollar business like coinbase should have practices for dealing with these edge cases and I closed my account voluntarily so there should be no issues in just reopening it.... in my dreams at least.
