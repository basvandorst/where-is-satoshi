Ah that's new to me, thanks! That seems like a good fit for both the payment processors and the vendors, ideally providing a smooth transition toward vendors transacting in actual BTC.
The comment I made was in reference to the Wired interview I read with Overstock's CEO, in which I understood that Overstock was only receiving USD. I could be confusing that with some of the other news I've been reading tonight, and I should really be sleeping instead of Bitcoin-redditing (the most addictive kind!) so please forgive me if I've gotten that wrong.

Overstock is receiving USD, not BTC. Coinbase is the intermediary. So Overstock has no BTC to sell nor hold.

Yes, definitely would! I'd especially like to see serious discussion about the difficulties BTC faces. Believe me, I love the validation of my own opinions that this community provides, and there's some good discussion if you wade through the "limitless up-and-up" posts. But I'm really thirsting for some moderated, tempered discussion about the very real challenges BTC will have to overcome to become mainstream. yields some, but it's also (appropriately) infatuated with price and day-trading opinions.
Do it!

Did you mean that the other way around?
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:13:24
Hi Eric, my apologies if I've missed your comments about this elsewhere, but could you explain what you mean by that? I always thought that fixed supply == deflationary, in this context.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:06:42
Can you elaborate on that? I'm having a hard time understanding why you're so confident that this technology is so unique as to overcome human nature.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:54:50
Do you have some experience with it? And if so, would you mind explaining what the value you receive from the magazine is? I've come to recognize your name around here and I respect your point of view.
I'd especially love it if you did a longish review of the magazine on your project over there... (nudge

I just signed up with CampBx myself, might be worth looking into. I'm not too familiar with bitstamp, but I know CampBx is supposed to start offering ACH withdrawal of USD beginning today.

How is access to this Computrace interface controlled? I assume Computrace themselves have access to any machine with this installed in the BIOS, and pass along access to other entities somehow? I've never heard of this software before, but it sounds like a massive vulnerability if it works as you've described.
Thanks for the post!

Just out of curiosity, and forgive me if this has been addressed elsewhere, but why are you interested in targeting eBay in your short list of companies to address in your article? The amount of money and effort (I assume) they've put into making PayPal successful seems to me to almost guarantee hostility, at least during these formative days for Bitcoin. I'm no analyst, and you're the one with the successful writing career here! I'm just trying to understand what value you're looking to add to your piece by suggesting something that seems "when pigs fly"-unlikely to a layman like myself.
Looking forward to reading the article!

Wow, so will that aim to bridge the gap between Bitcoin and MPesa? Pretty cool if so, somehow I thought that'd take longer.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:40:37
Great points in this discussion, and I agree that reliance on centralized exchanges (read: places with a bullseye painted on them for effective and damaging regulation) is a serious concern.
On that note, I believe one of the most important projects MasterCoin is working on is a de-centralized exchange protocol that sits right on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Only time will tell how that plays out, but it seems like the next essential step if Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency as a whole) is to become truly powerful.

Just to be clear, is it your opinion that this behavior by big holders is occurring, or is there solid evidence for it? I'm not saying it's unreasonable or unlikely, but I would like to know if this is backed up by concrete data.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:40:24
If you expect BTC to rise steadily, wouldn't it make sense to drop out of Apple and recoup the losses with Bitcoin rather than expecting to do so with your current holdings? Not at all asking you to change your position, just learning and trying to fill in the gaps in what I understand.
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:05:59
I just wanna say you're awesome, and this kind of forward-thinking really inspires me to improve and be more creative with the way I look at BTC.
Overall this subreddit is a great community, but we definitely need more creative evangelists like you posting details about exactly how you are making BTC work in a business sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:29:34
I agree with what you're saying, I just feel less convinced that those people and corporations that currently leverage huge amounts of fiat won't find ways to subvert, cripple, or de-legitimize it. I'm not at all making the case that BTC is screwed, and I'm certainly not capable of pointing out potential flaws.
I just know from observing history that greed creates extreme creativity and entrenched wealth has a remarkable knack for control and self-preservation. So I keep a healthy amount of skepticism or pessimism about bullet-proof bitcoin claims.
I really hope you're right. It just sounds too good to be true. Already we see some manipulation - price walls are an example. No one can truly know how things will play out until they do.
(EDIT: May have gotten a little off-topic here in that we started off talking about "new wealth" rather than the entrenched system in place with fiat currencies, but I still believe the point for a healthy degree of skepticism stands, so I'm going to leave the comment as is.)
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:57:25
Really fascinating, thanks. For me, it made for a very potent reminder of how quickly the price has skyrocketed recently (aka when I started really paying attention), and how that compares with an otherwise much longer history. I appreciate the perspective.

I'm on the fence as well about the strength of such publicity. But while I'm not sure that "any publicity is good publicity", one thing I'm more certain of is "any widespread adoption is good adoption". Will we see more boom and bust as speculators enter, become disillusioned, and leave? Yes...but that's already been happening, and look at the momentum we've developed along the way. And I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that a chunk of any new speculators will become passionate believers as they learn about their investment.
Anything that gives more humans a stake in Bitcoin's future necessarily generates more velocity and inertia. There is an incredible amount of entrepreneurship, innovation, and good old-fashioned hard work being poured into Bitcoin at the moment, and by many very talented people. That wouldn't exist to such a degree without the crazy boom we're experiencing.
I say bring on the booms! We will weather the busts. And each time,  we'll be left with a more resilient, deep, and potent Bitcoin on the other side.

For me the point is that the huge and rapid expansion in Bitcoin user base was not matched in actual Bitcoin usability developments - it was too much too fast. You're right, not a lot we can do about that, but I would argue that more premature exposure is bad for Bitcoin,  if it winds up leaving a bad taste in people's mouths. First impressions, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:15:27
So you're saying I really should abandon my family and start buying BTC? That's exactly the validation I needed, woooohoooo!
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:36:41
It is highly expensive to mine bitcoin today. You'd need a large investment, and a hardware manufacturer you can trust.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:15:55
I wish you all the best of luck! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:39:14
Hmm maybe I came off snarky by accident. I was just trying to make a joke by comparing my family to a "sunk cost". I'm actually very minimally invested in BTC, because I'd feel pretty scummy if I messed stuff up for us.
Thanks for naming the fallacy though, definitely contributed to my knowledge about this world.
