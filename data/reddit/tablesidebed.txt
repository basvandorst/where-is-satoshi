Wow! We are not your machine to make you feel better....Let me tell you, you are not convinced. How about some learning? Go take a Crypto-currencies course @ Princeton University or Stanford online for free...
For me, beside the financial benefits, it allowed me to have new vocabulary, I learned some cool stuffs that I can impress my friends with....if you are into such a thing :).
So forget your wallet now for the month, while you learn more. Maybe you will have enough time to get your 100 back before it's too late...Or you might quit your job to make it easier for your fellow Canucks to buy bitcoin....
