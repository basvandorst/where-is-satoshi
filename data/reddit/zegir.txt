Yes, you need a wallet so that you can receive the bitcoin.  The bitcoin you buy at the ATM will be transferred to the bitcoin receiving address you'll see on your mobile wallet. Having a phone that is able to scan QR codes is easier than having to input the entire receiving address.

From what I've read it's also about the which groups support or oppose SegWit2x along with the technical expertise, support, testing, and trust that SegWit2x has. Apparently SegWit2x has the support of many companies, but is undertested and lacks people with intimate knowledge of the BitCoin network. The Core developers are completely against the idea of SegWit2x because they think that it is unnecessary and will not support it on their nodes.

You transfer through GDAX. You first have to login through GDAX. You will see a deposit button (on the left panel, I think), which will display an overlay with various tabs of deposit options when clicked. One of those tabs will have an option to transfer from Coinbase.

Come on, guy. Which one is it? I'd have to research the words and acronyms you used in order to get the general gist of what you said so I don't botch the process and lose my money. The average user shouldn't have to do that. The average user probably won't even realize there is opt-in replay protection, but would still want to split their coins.

Can you explain to me how that works?
Currently we have BitCoin A (BTC). Between now and November we have the possibility of BitCoin A and B (B2X). If the hardfork happens you suggest that BitCoin B becomes BitCoin A? How can say B2X turn into BTC if the fork happens?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:34:13
Correct me if I'm wrong, but without Segwit2x the Lightening Network cannot be implemented, correct? I think that ties into statement about the people deciding what works best since a lot of people what faster transaction times, less fees, and more scaling.

Okay, I wasn't sure whether Segwit2x had included more stuff that was related to LN functionality. The major issue I have with this is that they haven't even implemented the first Segwit yet to get any real world metrics and they already want to implement version 2.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:50:53
Yeah, I'm really curious to see what happens and the effect it has. If they don't agree to merge the code then that will create another competing coin. More so than now with the other altcoins because there is actually an agreement between major companies to transition to the new Segwit2x implementation. It's really interesting because this conflict could be one of the make or break moments for Bitcoin.

I don't know what type of Bitcoin ATM you're close to, but there are ATMs where you only need to enter your phone number so that you can get the code. No ID is needed. Make sure you account for the Bitcoin ATM fee which can be as high as 20%.

Gemini allows you to do this, but only via ACH deposit. The limit is $500/day and you can't withdraw funds until the deposit clears after 4-5 days. You also have to go through a verification process when you sign up.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:35:29
Right? The LN probably won't even be implemented by the end of the year and people here are talking about Schnorr, MAST, and sidechains already.

This article doesn't really say anything. The headline mentions a Litecoin example and I didn't see it. I don't know if Litecoin has/had any internal issues about Segwit, but internal opposition is the main issue for Bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:00:10
"You're just like..." Okay. All I'm saying is to keep an eye out on what happens at least a month or so out from a major development in the space. You never know what will happen with the fork. Maybe a lot of major companies start to really adopt Segwit2x between November - January because things take time to develop and implement.

Yeah, I'm just saying words actually carry meaning.

You can also transfer to GDAX and buy directly from the exchange. Set your buy order as something above the current price so that the order isn't executed immediately and you will pay no fees.

Money can't be upgraded. Digital money, in this case, get its value from the tech. That's the tech being improved that increases or decreases the value of money. You can't point to a single bitcoin/litecoin/whatever and say "Upgrade that." No, you change the tech that is the foundation.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:54:09


I just want to point out that this sounds stupid. How can money be upgraded? It either increases or decreases in value.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:39:06
Yeah, but hopefully not before a new support level is created.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:59:19
This is pretty narrow perspective. There can be more than one problem that has to be solved. Some are more obvious than others or  take time to discover. The Bitcoin Network currently has issues, but there are improvements that have happened and may happen in the future that can also reduce these issues. 


I also don't think you're correct in your statement here mainly because of the short time frame, but you never know. I think of the current state Bitcoin as the WWW. It was good and had major limitation until more improvements were made on top of it.
I'm still pretty new to the crypto community here on Reddit, but you guys hold some serious hatred for anything other.  I'm just happy we have options and ways to improve upon the tech and possibly make some money and change the way we do day-to-day things.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:21:55


I know 2x doesn't mean version 2. I was just being cheeky because the only difference is the size and SegWit isn't out in the real world yet. I've read some articles/posts about the people/companies in the NYA trying to control bitcoin. Final result should be interesting.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:17:07
The maximum number of trillionaires would be 21. I don't think there would be that many though. I had thoughts wondering how many billioniares Bitcoin have/could have made if they got in while it was still in the single digits and bought more/held.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:06:15
No, I'm not mad for very reasons I mentioned and it has nothing to due with being new.  I also think getting angry about these things is a waste of time if you can't really change anything. Just enjoy the ride and then bail when necessary. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:44:21
Yes, there will still be 21 million bitcoin in the current chain. In order for you to have both coin types you would have to do a split. With control of your private keys this is possible, but I would wait to do that until things settle down a bit after the fork and proper instructions are released. It is possible for coins to be lost if you never split since you can't consolidate the two types of coins using the same keys.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:59:25
I don't care what happens with Bitcoin and its chains. I get money either way. When I see one chain losing value then perhaps I'll sell. Investors follow what is popular in the moment, but I think more than that they follow what holds more value and will net them more money. If they do their research and like the developer(s)/companies promoting Segwit2x then they will follow if they think they'll get value on their investment. I also think optics are very important and at the moment optics are terrible from all sides.

I think you're wrong on this front. Potential investors will be split between three chains. They will look at all the information thusfar and see that there is significant opposition to this Segwit2x hardfork and maybe hedge their bets elsewhere.

What about the companies who agreed to implement Segwit2x? Will there be compatibility issues? Will the companies completely switch over to nodes that are compatible with Segwit2x and not Bitcoin? I wouldn't say that Segwit2x will fail at the moment since there is a lot still up in the air.

I think it also has to do with expertise. Apparently the SegWit2x developer(s) don't have the intimate knowledge of the BitCoin network. Seems like it is being rushed out the door with little testing.

Thanks for the reply. I've been reading more articles about the pros and cons of the LN. One of the things that caught my attention in the posted article was that the security model is completely different. I think you touched on how that would be solved by possibly having LN hubs being used by card payment processors and/or banks. Really interesting dilemma. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:12:46
They mean don't have your coins held on an exchange because you don't hold the private keys so you don't have full control of your coins. Desktop, Mobile, Hardware, and Paper wallets would qualify as your own wallet.

I could maybe see $100,000 in ten years if these technical issues and ease of use issues are solved. However, these issues are really tough to solve for currently. I really want to see want happens after the LN gets implemented and used by a solid number of people and what they learn from it.

@_date: 2017-08-19 19:44:08
I don't know if it is an issue per-say, but CoPay supports the SegWit2x hardfork. Mycelium doesn't support the hardfork: view here   Segwit and Segwit2x nodes will not be compatible with each other. In your case you may not be able to consolidate your bitcoins into the other one after the fork.

Reddit Gold is good. Sending the equivalent amount in Bitcoin is better.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:42:52
If you bought 1 bitcoin and you move your coin to a wallet you will still have 1 bitcoin (minus transaction fees). The value of the coin will depend on the exchange you're looking at. If you're just going by the price provided by GDAX then your bitcoin located in your wallet is valued at that price.  You can start using a paper wallet anytime you like.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:31:52
Just transfer your coins to Coinbase for now if you're not confident in your ability to split coins yourself. They'll do it for you and you don't have to worry about it. Once they split it (they say about 4 hours after the fork) you can sell/hold/whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:48:50
It's fine for now. Eventually you will want to send your coins to your own wallet. Especially if all you're doing is holding them. However, if you want an equal amount of B2X coins when the fork happens in about 2 weeks then leave them at Coinbase so they can do the split for you.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:14:06


To help you with this you can use the mobile app [Blockfolio]( to keep track of your investments. Or for desktop [CryptoCompare]( You just have to input the amount of bitcoin you bought, the price you bought at, and the date you bought.

I've heard Breadwallet is good, but I don't use it.
Right, so take that deposit/receiving address generated by Breadwallet and paste it into the empty address box on the withdrawal/send tab in GDAX. When you're ready to transfer coins from Breadwallet to Gemini you get the deposit/receiving address generated by Gemini and paste that into empty address box for withdrawing/sending bitcoin on Breadwallet.
There are transaction fees when moving bitcoins between wallets/exchanges (for the miners). There are deposit/withdrawal fees on GDAX. No fees when depositing/withdrawing* on Gemini ([Gemini Fees]( Low fees when buying/selling coins on Gemini (.25%). 
*Only 30 btc/eth withdrawals are free per month. I don't withdraw coins that much per month so it is free for me.

A bit of clarification: The Coinbase website is a broker. GDAX (also owned by Coinbase) is an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:40:21


No, no, no. An exchange will never need your private key. The private key is yours and yours alone. Maybe you mean the sending/receiving address?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:48:52
Depositing money using Coinbase/GDAX is nice because of the free limit orders.  The disadvantage is the fees when depositing/withdrawing.  
You could look into the [Gemini]( exchange. There are no fees for depositing/withdrawing. They have a max daily limit for deposits set at $500 via ACH that you can use immediately for buying. The caveat is that you can't withdraw BTC/ETH(Ethereum) until the deposited amount clears the bank in four or five days.  There are fees for buying/selling, but they are low ([Gemini Fee Calculation]( 
The price of Bitcoin on Gemini is usually lower than the price on GDAX also. Sometimes I will buy on Gemini and then transfer to my wallet.  Or I would buy some bitcoin and transfer to GDAX to buy/sell using limit orders.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:04:50
It would be from GDAX to Gemini. You don't have to send coins from GDAX to Coinbase and then to Gemini.
The process works the same as it would sending to and from any other bitcoin exchange or wallet. Copy the deposit address from Gemini and paste it into the input box for withdrawals on GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:25:09
No fees for limit orders.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:03:20
Bitcoin addresses are for sending and receiving coin to and from wallets/exchanges. There are sending addresses and receiving addresses. These are the addresses that Coinbase displays in the transactions. 
What you mean is the private key, which Coinbase does not share with you. The only way to get your own private key is to send your coin to your own hardware, software, or paper wallet ([Paper Wallet steps]( Once the coins are in your own wallet you can then follow the appropriate steps to get the private key.  
Edit: Some hardware/software wallets ask you to instead write down the seed that is generated. It works the same way as a private key so that you can still have access to your coins within the wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:51:29
Yeah, look at the Coinbase help pages for deposit/withdrawal fees. There are fees to withdraw USD into your bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:05:11
After you sent your coins to a paper wallet and you've accumulated enough bitcoin you want to send those coins to an exchange and sell them after some time. The design of paper wallets allows for easy deposits to the paper wallet using the deposit address, but not for sending bitcoin.  
In order for you to do that you have to download a software wallet and sweep the private key from your paper wallet onto a newly generated software wallet. You can then send/receive bitcoin using the normal steps. 
Sweeping means relocating all of your funds from the old paper wallet to the new software wallet. Exchanges don't have the functionality to sweep private keys (a good thing). If you want to send your coins to a paper wallet again then you don't use the same paper wallet, but instead create an entirely new paper wallet to send the coins to.

Actually, the high was around 4.9k when it crashed down to 3k, but to the point your trend (Fibonacci) says it isn't done climbing yet. 
3 + 2 = ~5, 5 + 3 = ~8.

First question: Did you read the newcomer sticky post? If the answer is no, then you should go do that first.

It's a retirement fund and is held long term by its nature. Shouldn't have to be used for emergencies anyway.

I don't know about it dropping to $4700, but there  could be a drop solely due to the psychological nature of hitting $5000.

I've seen this list before and it seems to be the only source. Those are only 57 (F2pool dropped out) companies and I don't know how much influence these companies have compared to the companies that haven't issued a statement such as Bitrexx, Bitfinex, Gemini, Kraken, and others. That is my point because we don't know where these companies stand so how can there be a statement that says "most companies want this" when that might not even be true? I say stick to the facts: "Around 60 companies have signed the NYA for Segwit2x."


I honestly don't know if $500 per BCH is a lot or a little when looking at it independently.  Looking at the charts BCH has been having a tough time with a steady decrease, but that can always change. When comparing the price to Bitcoin it is a small percentage. I also wouldn't say that the BCH price is $500 because the users want bigger blocks since there is no way to know that. There could be a multitude of reasons.


This discussion is occurring for many reasons. One of which is the way this hard fork came about; in the shadows, behind closed doors. Other reasons include: the uncertainty of the Segwit2x development team, the limited real world testing, and a feeling of rushed implementation.  I would like to see companies issue a statement in a newsletter or to the media explaining the ins and outs of the situation and then asking their users what they think.  Otherwise, and I'll say this again, we don't know what these users would be telling the companies because 1) they may not care regardless, 2) they're ignorant of the situation, or 3) the companies ignore the users.

Doesn't hurt to put in $100.  You could also look into other crypto currencies such as LTC (Litecoin) or ETH (Ethereum).

I'm seeing 700+ sell walls on GDAX. I don't think 5k is happening tonight.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:13:22
You can deposit money on Coinbase then transfer to GDAX and buy there with no fees using limit orders that do not fill immediately.
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:03:20
Probably still asleep. It's still in the 4700's. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:11:30
IOTA isn't there yet. It's still in growing pains.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:02:20
The price could have dropped just as easily.

You could have helped him out by pointing him to some resources so that they were better educated about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:47:50
I would have either held or traded it for LTC in the hopes the price increases to $90/100+ again.
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:29:11
Can he just fuck off and write his own code? Jesus.

Hey, have you checked out any of the exchanges listed here: 
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:06:53
No, I wouldn't say that. GDAX is pretty easy to use. You can put your USD deposit (via bank account) into Coinbase and then transfer to GDAX for the lower fees (0.25% via marker order/free via non-immediate limit order). If you're cool with the 0.25% fee then just do market orders and you're done.

You find the ticker you want to buy then go to the Buy panel under the Trading section and put in the amount of bitcoin/trig/nav you want.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:04:20
Sounded like a joke post to me. Just making fun of the thousands of other times people have said Bitcoin would fail within X amount of time.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:31:58
I heard Kraken allows this.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:51:36


Nah, more likely around 6-8k to end the year. 10k early next year maybe.
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:10:47
Read the newcomers post. That's the first step.
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:50:59
Yeah, Coinbase has serious issues. I would actually look for a Bitcoin ATM or LibertyX place that takes cash and buy bitcoin there until the verification stuff gets sorted out.  You can also try Coinmama, which also accepts credit cards and then transfer to whatever exchange/wallet you need to.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:19:49
You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin. You can buy fractional amounts.
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:12:24
Maybe, but it was really close. Within $20-$50 of 5k on most exchanges 30 or so minutes ago.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:50:07
Use their GDAX exchange and place limit orders.

Dollar Cost Average from here until the mid-end of November. I think there is when we will see a definite answer as to if a decent dip is coming or not.
