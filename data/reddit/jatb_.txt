It's nice that you funded the Internet Archive, they have a good heart and vision. Unfortunately they are hampered ridiculously by copyright legislation.
That million $USD would actually be most of the finances required to build the *replacement* for Internet Archive.
Financing the IA (and EFF) is great, but neither organisation is actually capable of doing more than the status quo allows or affecting any change in the area of digital preservation.
Replacing the IA will require a commercial entity, following the model of a Usenet newsgroup provider with a centralised^1 storage network, the control of which can be ceded to its users in a manner which cannot be legally censored in any Western nation^2. Luckily accessing the data in such a system would not require a subscription, as a Freenet opennet-style p2p network can be interfaced with by the user-controlled nodes.
There is actually a great model for this. In the future though people will take it for granted, like how no one actually thinks about the moving parts behind their daily driver technology, but I would not be bringing any of this up if it were without merit. The most important thing in the world to me is the end of censorship (10+years contributing to the first darknet software - Freenetproject.org, which would be a wonderful place to throw some money if nowhere else) and rights restriction technologies like DRM. People seem to love these ICO things lately, so I will continue with setting up the "token sale" for the system I am talking about, but if you feel like making a long term investment in the digital archive we *need*, I would actually suggest that we talk . . .
