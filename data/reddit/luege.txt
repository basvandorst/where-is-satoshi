It's a safe bet because you're only investing small amounts of fiat anyway. However, you will not see much return as the coin already has the highest value. People always talk about volatility when it comes to the cryptocurrency market and that's what excites me. My advice? Get in on a smaller coin where there is potential for growth. Have a look at appcoins.

Reddit isn't connected to cryptocurrency? Just because I have been on Reddit for 4 days doesn't mean I've been interested in crypto for 4 days

On the contrary, it's a great time to invest. Bear market and prices are low.

Don't worry about it, that's what we're here for. Reddit is a great place to start for information. Appcoins is just a suggestion as it's a project I really believe in. Do plenty of your own research before investing. Look at the whitepapers, website and the teams behind coins and then make a decision. It's a lot of fun! Good luck, any questions don't hesitate to ask. 
Edit: should go without saying - only invest what you can afford to lose! Although the volatility is exciting, it has ruined people's lives. Invest intelligently.

True but what useful information have you contributed?
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:58:20
Why is that?

This is probably a stupid question, I'm relatively new but why does tether matter so much? Is it Just because it's tied to USD? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:43:58
Considering that, why is it that tether is holding its own (slightly) meanwhile everything else is red?

Then it will become ultimate crypto gold,  huge demand or a complete disaster and Ethereum will take over.

Isn't everything in life a gamble if you go into it without the necessary knowledge?

They all bought in too high while spreading FUD and now gun slingers are pulling out
