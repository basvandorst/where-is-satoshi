Split is such a great place!
If you want to experience "the mediterranean culture", wine and food and white houses by the sea - go to Croatia, not Italy. In Italy, you'll pay 8€ for a can of coke in Venice, followed by a €1,000 gondoliere trip by someone who's just sick and tired of having tourists up to his ears. In Croatia, the same €8 is enough to get you some of the best seafood dishes on earth, on a restaurant by the sea, with some of the streets around you built by the Roman Empire and the local buildings looking like something out of *Assassin's Creed*. And afterwards you can sip off a double espresso for €2 or €1.
And yeah, bitcoin signs everywhere. The economy is pretty bad off-season, so prices are even lower then and some of it is under the table.

If he "dumps when it is convenient for him", it's probably when the price has gone up, right? Otherwise he would lose money - a lot of it. 
So you have claimed he does two things :
1. Buying low, thus driving up low prices 
2. Selling high, thus driving down the Bitcoin price when it is high 
Both of these two things reduces the volatility and will push the Bitcoin price towards the average. This is just basic economics!
Highly speculated assets (such as the EUR / USD currency pair)  show less volatility than less speculated assets due to this essential economic relationship known as "the law of demand".

Ugh, not the "speculators" fallacy again. No, they can't make money by selling under the market value, nor can they make money from buying above market value. The only profitable reason to sell now is that they expect the price to fall even further. And the only profitable reason to buy now is if the prices will increase in the future.
That market prices are somehow controlled by some global conspiracy of puppet masters instead of set by supply and demand of all the participants, is a very tempting way to shift the blame from our own forecasting failures and onto some big bad meanies in the shadows.
You know who Putin blames for the ruble losing its value? "Speculators".
You know who Maduro is blaming for the price inflation in Venezuela? "Speculators".
You know who were blamed for the 90's Swedish currency crisis when the central bank set the interest rate at 500% to maintain the peg against the Ecu? "Speculators".
You, me, everyone buying, selling or using bitcoin (or are choosing to use something else instead) are the "speculators" that are setting the price together. And if you are losing money or if you are making less than someone else, then you should have speculated better.

Americans can open offshore accounts in banks in Belize, Andorra, Uruguay, Dubai, Lebanon and many other banking hubs.

Byblos bank in Lebanon is the world's highest capitalized consumer bank and they are open for private consumers.

A recent ruling in the European Court of Human Rights made it clear not long ago that it's illegal to punish someone twice for the same crime. It used to be the case that the Swedish authorities punished tax evaders first by making tax convicts pay back the tax "owed", then pay a surcharge, then pay fines and/or serve a prison sentence.
Now they stopped enforcing the surcharges and fines so they can make sure to put tax evaders in prison instead. Usually you get more time in prison for running a small business than if you murder someone. Unless you murder a cop, of course, then you're in for life.
There's also asset forfeiture. If you have cars, cash etc and you can't *prove* that you earned it through taxed sources, they can seize it and forfeit it. They found a wad of 10,000 SEK (about €1,000) under a teenagers bed, forfeited it and then used the fact that he had so "much" cash outside the banking system as proof that he was selling drugs.
Oh, and don't worry about getting away. Cell phone data from half a decade ago is routinely transferred to the tax agency in tens of thousands of tax audits per year, to confirm you didn't spend enough days within Swedish borders to be hit with residential taxation. Haven't caught so many terrorists with this surveillance apparatus yet, though, but I guess that'll happen any day now given how important FRA was in fighting terrorism in Afghanistan. At least, that's what they told us.
In other news, new-born Swedish citizens now can be given person numbers (SSNs) within 30 seconds of birth, nurses using a new web based interface connected to the tax authority citizen database.
I wonder if I could get a government grant researching methods cutting this down to 10 seconds? Half a minute of tax avoiding anarchy is more than any infant should have to bear.
