If you look at the numbers, Trump got almost an identical amount of votes that Romney did. What really happened is that the right turned up as they usually do, and the left was not excited by Clinton and did not turn out.
@_date: 2016-12-05 19:52:18


You are commenting on an article about Coinbase users that sold bitcoin for dollars.  
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:12:30
If you sell bitcoin then your coinbase account is credited and your bank account (or wherever the dollars go) is debited. 
What other questions do you have?

Ok, you are just an outsider then.

I think these are the issues that need to be resolved. We all know that we have to pay taxes on our income. We just have no idea, or good clear guidance, on exactly what is what. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 20:03:49
This is correct. Trump had about the same amount of votes that Romney did. Nobody knew came out to support Trump that did not already vote GOP candidates previously. There was little excitement for Clinton coupled with the media saying it was pretty much already over.. caused a large amount of people not to vote.

@_date: 2012-09-18 01:29:53


I think you are confused. Perhaps you are trying to cite the work of Milton Friedman, in which he found that from 1929 to 1931 the money supply went from 26.5 to 19, the monetary base went from 7.1 to 8.4, and the money multiplier went from 3.7 to 2.3.  So in other words, the money supply fell because the money multiplier fell 38%.  The money multiplier fell because the currency-deposit ratio both rose substantially.  Bank failures caused the money supply to fall by altering the behavior of both depositors and bankers. The result of this finding was that if the money supply would have been increased, the economy would have been better off.  The results were NOT about too much central bank interference.
@_date: 2012-09-16 20:38:34
It won't be garbage, we are likely to see less than 4% inflation.  3.5% is considered normal and healthy for economies. 
But to the actual point, bitcoin (which does have changes in supply as well) will have an increase in supply significantly less than the dollar will in the next year.  Naturally as the dollar goes down, assets will rise to accommodate the price level increase.  Since Bitcoin has limited supply increase, we should expect upwards pressure... assuming demand for bitcoins stays constant.
@_date: 2012-09-18 04:27:44


I don' think you have the slightest clue what you are talking about... They confessed that what caused the Great Depression was too much growth in the money supply??  I did a quick google, Bernanke holds the same view that Milton Friedman does on the subject.


You don't hang out in r/economics much do you?
Main reply to that article actually makes a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2012-09-16 20:36:00
Peter Schiff's economic predictions are garbage. He is very sympathetic to mercantilist economic views, as well as inaccurate inflation theories such as the quantity theory of money. 
Please don't trust him on inflationary predictions, because they are extremely inaccurate. 
@_date: 2012-09-17 20:47:30
What did he get right, that the federal reserve is likely to take action when the economy doesn't improve?  Anyways there was no economic crash of 2012 was there?
@_date: 2012-09-18 01:06:42


What exactly do you mean when you say people are abandoning the dollar?  
The 6 most traded currencies (in order) are the USD, Euro, Yen, GBP, Franc, Canadian. Since 2008 the Euro has gone down vs the dollar, the British pound has gone down vs the dollar, the Canadian dollar has traded pretty evenly with the dollar.  True the Franc and Yen have appreciated in comparison to the dollar (both have been trying to fight off deflation).  China of course is widely known to have tight controls on the value of their currency, and thus have been able to target the value they want.
Moral of the story is that I think it is unfair to blame this on central bank policy, because it is just one element of a large equation.  And I also think it is quite inaccurate to claim the dollar is being abandoned.  
I don't expect any of Schiff's predictions to come true. Hyperinflation is not just around the corner (the Federal Reserve has the tools to combat it), and there likely won't be a large market crash.  The dollar will keep it's value.  International markets still have faith in the US economy (check out treasury rates, and the nominal interest rate minus inflation...).
Anyways good chatting, hope you can get passed Schiff (I used to agree with him as well).

Uh no we aren't.  Sure we aren't growing as fast as we would like, but that is not the definition of a depression in economics. 


If you annualize the monthly figure Bernanke gave, it would be $480 billion.


Says who?  There is no analysis behind what you are saying. I have my questions about QE, but the worst effect it will have is bringing inflation up to a historically normal rate, which in most economists opinions is a good thing.  Our low rates of inflation since 2008, has done nothing to encourage lending because the cost of holding cash is very little. As inflation rises that cost becomes more and more, and thus more investment will occur.
@_date: 2016-10-05 18:26:47

The increase the money supply by buying Treasury securities, their holdings can been seen in this [graph](  Their Treasury schedule is about [$45 billion]( for this month.
They also do about $40 billion a month in agency backed mortgages. A [graph]( can be seen for that too, but that is the overall value of those securities which appears to still be declining.

I think a lot of volume could have been from the exit of hidden money from Cyprus and into bitcoin. Russian launderers set up new accounts somewhere else... a week or two once the accounts are set up, transfer bitcoin to currency and into the new account and the funds stay hidden.
The large rise in bitcoin price coincides with the Cyprus banking crisis.  As well as a boost from recent announcements from the Bank of Japan.  The question is if that type of demand will be sustained.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:47:58

This subreddit is one big *pump and dump* scheme of speculators. They will always tell people to buy no matter what the volatility, price, etc.  It is sad to see younger kids post about losing their savings that they were going to use on a new game system, or adults that lost more.
At the end of the day, everyone needs to become more familiar with market operations and the tendencies those operations can have during certain events.  Be careful, especially if you are a speculator rather than a bitcoin user.

The government didn't encourage subprime mortgages that were fraudulently underwritten, appraisals that purposefully overstated value, and overleverage.  If we look at the Federal Funds rate it [actually was raised 2004-2008]( that would be tightening of monetary policy, not loosening.  So far all of the evidence says exactly the opposite of what you say.  And the funny thing is that you provide absolutely no evidence at all.  So how about you provide some real evidence to back up what you say instead of just repeating common myths.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:01:02
I am looking at Fannie's historical balance sheet and I don't see the over leverage of assets that you are talking about. Their liabilities increased slower than their assets from 2005-2007, giving higher shareholder equity each year.  Do you have anything that  you could point me to that shows the leveraging?
Edit: Here is where I am getting my info.  If you look in the right most column you can see a *financial leverage* chart, looking at the 10 year it looks like they were deleveraging leading up to the crisis.

Then why didn't the price go right back up after the gox lag and gox had to cease trading once they saw more sell offs?
And also if you have inefficient exchanges that can't properly handle what is thrown at them (including attacks), then it is overvalued because the technology is not at the right stage.

Everyone is playing the market. This is what I fear about bitcoin. The price increase in the last few weeks is not from more use of bitcoin as a means of exchange, it is a bunch speculators. If bitcoin doesn't gain traction with vendors then this whole ordeal is just *someone playing the market* and in theory once they are purged from the system it will return to the $12 or so value.

The Austrian Business Cycle is a cool fairy tail and all, but it doesn't explain the 2008 financial crisis.
If you look at the [Federal Reserves historical assets]( (which you should have already done with such a claim) then you see that the Federal Reserve was not aggressively expanding monetary base. In fact if you look at historical annual growth rates in monetary base you can see that it is at [relatively low levels in the 2000's](  So once again Austrian Economics makes an attempted explanation without even studying the variables that they claim are the root cause of economic problems.

They aren't printing currency is what he meant to say.  They just create digital currency on their balance sheet and transfer it in exchange for the assets.  And they are actually doing more like $85 billion a month right now, so on a 31 day month that would be $115m per hour.

I am confused, I thought you said the recession was from the Federal Reserve "printing money".  So now it is about the Community Reinvestment Act (which various presidents have been a part of not just Clinton by the way).  You linked me to a page to buy a book.  Not any evidence. 
Here is some evidence that the mortgage crisis was not caused by CRA.  IN 2004-2006 [CRA loans were **less likely to default than subprime**](  Most [CRA areas had a less severe boom and bust]( it was the suburban areas that were hit the worst.  Freddie and Fannie [reduced the amount of mortgages from 2003-2006]( while subprime mortgages experienced a large boom and were mostly sold to Wall Street.
Oh yeah.  And the easiest thing to look at which completely makes your "CRA is to blame" theory debunked is that the CRA is for the United States.  So why the hell did [most of the global economy experience a housing boom and bust at the same time]( 
Anyways, CRA is not considered "printing money", which was your original accusation of what caused the financial meltdown.  Try doing some research, not reading one of the worst and least accurate economists out there.
Now prove that you are an Austrian and ignore everything I just said and come back tomorrow talking about how the evil Federal Reserve caused the financial crisis.

Its called a fire sale. When somebody doesn't give a shit about maximizing their sale value and really just need to cash out for liquidity call (they are going bankrupt, have other urgent investments that need to be funded, etc.) then they are willing to dump at whatever price possible. Fire sales have occurred many times throughout history, there is no reason that Bitcoin would be immune to them.  
And also once the price starts going down in a fire sale, herd mentality will kick in and lots of people will try to get out as they see prices tumbling. Look into the Lehman collapse if you want to see more examples.
