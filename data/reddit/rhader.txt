I stand corrected :) bitcoin has grown by many orders of magnitudes in the last 5 years. The challenges of the next 5 years are unique, challenge some, and daunting. But im sure thats how the challenges of the previous 5 years seemed from the cusp of its inception.

I agree. There are many options for btx 2.0 which are further along dao than ethereum. Ethereum has a reslly shiny name and its marketing has been far better than btc 2.0 so of course people will gravitate to it. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:50:29
The only reason for cold paper wallets is to store btc. Not to spend periodically.  If you want to spend periodically from your "cold paper wallet" your doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 23:49:07

The video is fairly accurate. The petro dollar is literally the only mechanism by which the dollar is maintaining its current value. Once countries start, as we are seeing now, to move away from the petro dollar, the dollars over seas; which now have no purpose, will flow back into the US, causing massive inflation. Either way the petro dollar is doomed, either by new technological progress and the era of clean tech, or either by ideological difference other countries have with Washington policies.

The banks dont want to be near anything they dont control 100%. Its that simple. By asking for all your private information, they essentially own your on-line presence by acquiring all data about you.

The level of foolishness in Shillslayers comment is repulsive. The very fact is that some people simply can't forecast the type of effect certain technologies will have on the world. Yes, the internet had a few people using it in 1989, but if you wern't a complete fool, you could extrapolate its usefulness and potential impact on future societies. Blockchain protocols are BIGGER then the internet. If you fail to see this, you sir, might be a fool.

Okay after trying this software out it seems promising, although rather clunky and difficult to look it. I am aware its still a prototype. The receive and pay tabs are a little confusing. If I want to receive GOLD and pay GOOG, what exactly does that imply?? Im assuming the max duration of 5 weeks is temporary correct? 
Lets say I think the Argentinian Peso is going to be lower 5 weeks from today? How would I be able to construct a smart contract that allows me to hedge my believe that the A. Peso will be lower in 5 weeks from today?

I see. I just filled the order. When trying to see all market orders, and doubling clicking on any particular order, it might be helpful to have specific information about that specific contract right above the place order and cancel tabs. For example, when I filled the BTC &amp; Peso order, it would be very helpful if the program could tell the user what ARS=X is. If I didn't know I would have to take time to google it and find out. It might be even more helpful to have some type of directory where you can look up an asset by its knowable human name. Furthermore, when executing or creating a trade, it would be nice to know exactly how much BTC you need for that particular trade. For example, when my trade was failing, I had no idea why and could only assume something was wrong with the program. The more information you can provide to the user, the more successful this project will be. I see 9 total orders on this program in the interface, but I see almost 0 information I want to see about the trades. I dont see the minimum or maximum amount of btcs for each trade, I dont see what those funky looking letters represent, collateral is an empty tab for all the trades, maybe the text would be better with a middle alignment, and also, columns separating heading tabs might be nice. Maybe some color customization options to differentiate text, background, and secondary background. I do understand this is a work in progress and am just giving my 2 satoshis about how this might be more appealing and successful.
Over all I'm very excited about these developments and cant wait till more liquidity it brought to this. I'll eagerly wait 2 weeks till this smart contract is executed to see how that process is handled. I can't believe I've been lucky enough to be born into an era where this is even possible. Amazing!

Really? Sensible? We have exploitative systems. One only needs to look to the remittance market. Half a trillion dollars being taken from the poorest among us, when the technology to send money like email, essentially for free, is available! Furthermore, there are amount 6 billion people that are either under banked or simply cant bank all together due to barriers caused by our current financial model. These new technologies cannot be deployed fast enough for most of the human population on this earth.

"According to the ministry, the ban is necessary as monetary surrogates are widely used for buying illegal goods and money laundering."
Monetary "surrogates" are far less fitting for the acquisition of illegal goods and services. Goes to show how little Russian oligarchs understand BTC. Furthermore, the Ruble, and most other cotton based fiat currencies have, and will continue to be, the primary method by which to purchase illegal substances and goods. Since, of course, it can't be traced on a public ledge like BTC can. The doublespeak is undeniable. Russia is doomed.

No. The American economy little sway on whether the dollar remains the world currency. The Chinese economy is clearly going to be much more dominant within 3-10 years, yet we arnt seeing a massive push to the yuan, or w/e they use. The main reason why every country must hold the USD is because if you want light in your office, water on your farm, gas in your tanks, you must get oil. And oil is only traded in the USD, or I should say, was. If you want energy, you must have USD, even if America is not involved in any way between the trading parties. Thats whats making the dollar the world reserve. Once that is over, it wont matter how big the US economy is when other can simply transact with their own currency and only deal with the USD if they actually deal with America.

Technically this is possible. Unlikely, but not impossible. Once to look at a planet through a telescope was impossible, or fly a plane, or travel to space. We are conditioned to think a certain way, but in reality, bitcoin can have any value we wish it to have. Certainly if its utility approaches that of a type 1 civ currency, which is really what bitcoin is. Whether bitcoin is THE type 1 currency/payment structure, we do not know. But whatever that may be, its worth will be far greater than we can anticipate today.

@_date: 2014-08-29 04:01:54
Thanks for the explanation. Ill take a look at those links after this. I suppose the biggest obstacle holding projects like these back is the lack of liquidity. Especially considering that most of the population isn't even aware of bitcoin's existence, why would big institutions jump in and provide near unlimited liquidity when the user base is less than a percent of bitcoin users? Of course the more astute players will recognize that this shift is inevitable, but I cant see why any one of them would jump in to provide unlimited liquidity, especially considering the tremendous uncertainty with global governments on btc 2.0 projects such as these, among others of course. Either way, I hope they do. If I were to pay the price exposure of the Argentinian Peso and receive the price exposure of bitcoin, that means I would be receiving bitcoin and paying the peso. Sounds like an excellent contract, for me of course :D now to see if there are any takers......

I dont think shit will get real sub 400. We have been there before from a high of 1200. Its bitcoin, its the most revolutionary tech since the internet and perhaps might be even mote revolutionary then it. A part of me hopes it drops sub 300, I would LOVE to get sub 300 btc. Many investors feel this way. The nubs will sell, the pros will buy. A whole new infrastructure is being built as we speak, it takes time. Most nubs got into btc expecting a rate of return within months. I expect my real rate of return in 5-10 years. People will sell and people will buy, but btc just keeps producing blocks along its merry way.

Couldnt have said it better myself. When I hodl and buy bitcoins the monetary aspect is second. When the people do not control their own wealth, controlling their own destiny becomes impossible, and exploitation inevitable. The banking cartel is not a US phenomena, its spread and reach literally knows no bounds. When you control the money, you control everything. This power MUST be taken out of the hands of a secretive closed group and place back in the peoples hands where it rightfully belongs, the only legitimate source of power. So yes, when I buy bitcoin, I choose to own my own wealth, I choose my own destiny, I choose to no longer be exploited, I choose freedom.

Btc is largely regulated by something called math. Furthermore,  if we ever choose to launch an investigation of btc we can always look at the source code, on top of being able to track pseudo-anonymous transactions. Of course btc needs mechanisms to protect from theft, fraud, or bankruptcies. But perhaps the best people or institutions best fit to provide this type of expertise are not the same entities that have utterly failed to regulate the current financial system, as is so plainly evident. Even in the most remote parts of the country people understand that the current "regulated" system, the same entities currently trying to regulate btc, is broken, and perhaps even intentionally so. The utter failure of regulators to tackle current problems of corruption, money laundering, theft, privacy violations, is tremendously profound. Yet, these regulators have the case of mind to step out of their bread and butter industry to try to regulate their competition. What low esteem these entities must have of the people. As if we cant plainly see this hypocrisy.

Well stated. I feel that we all feel this way about the regulations. I must add though, I'm not sure its to early for regulation, it just needs the right type of regulation. The typical institutional regulation the Ben is trying to implement will never work, whether its beta or not. I would not mind regulation for exchanges, crypto-stocks/derivatives/futures/ and the sorts. The fact that bitfinex can be hacked and all my funds gone is a major obstacle to mass adoption. This must be addressed if the wider audience is to jump into bitcoin. There must be some type of regulation that dictates what happens if or when that type of situation happens.

Where is all the money coming from that is funding terror cells, global security apparatuses, wars of aggression? Look at the tremendous power the current financial system provides to those that seek to gain from war. A logically and scrutinizing look into the financial dealings of those that fund wars and anyone can see the utter disregard for human life, liberty, and justice.

The only crimes being committed are the barbarous claims that innocent people who wish to self medicate are criminals and must be punished. We acknowledge that in some cases self medication is improper, but lengthy prison terms is insanity given the nature of the problem and its medical remedies. The fbi/cia rather have your dollars go to drug cartels that murder/torture/lie/terrorize millions of people instead of safely and securely on the Internet.

BTC will kill NYC if the city chooses a future without the crypto. Its inevitable. Right now the cities elite must be shitting bricks about what bitcoin is going to do to their control.

Your partially correct. Remittance cost can be as high as 25%.... BTC can bring that cost down to less then half a percent, worldwide. Were probably looking at over 100 billion in savings ALONE. Furthermore, those savings will be used in local infrastructure which is bound to create more economic vitality, thus bringing the true economic value much closer to a trillion over just a few years, and increasing even more throughout the life cycle without a cap. The advantages are clear. Very clear. This is just one aspect of disruption also. BTC v central fiat banks is the classical case of analog vs digital. I dont have to spend money to send an email to Africa do I? Then why should I spend money to send value?

Who ever goes along with this Bitlicense should be shunned by tbe community in its entirety. It shows that once any company becomes big enough, they are willing not only to betray their customers, but also betray the very foundation of the product they deal in. Those companies desearve to wither and die if they betray btc in this way, when so much is at stake so early on this btc road. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:38:42
I havnt given any btc business any personal data, nor will I ever. Any business that is willing to turn their back on a central feature of btc deserves to be cut out like a cancer. The fact that btc is incompatable with nyc regs is a feature of btc, not a problem. No regulator have the authority to super impose their will on a market consensus, that up to this point at least, has been just fine without them. This is the ultimate form of tyranny, for your own protection, give me all your personal information. wtf has this society come to that people are actually considering that giving someone your personal data is actually for your own protection.

Other states can greatly stand to benefit from nyc foolish "regulation." California, texas, flordia; as well as other centers of commerce, HK, london to name only 2. Nyc will wither and die if this is the direction they choose to take on the future of money. Its equivalent to them rejecting the internet. Maybe in 1992 they can reject the internet in their ignorance, only to their eventual demise. Likewise, btc block chain tech promises to be just as big, if not bigger, than the internet itself.

These group of bankers/government heads literally hold billions of people hostage in an attempt to extract value from their citizens to enrich themselves. Its disgusting. With the internet we can clearly see this! And now with bitcoin as well. What premise, logic, or evidence is used in this law? Where was the discussion with the citizens? This is blatant, oppressive, and an instrument to keep billions under the foot of a powerful few.

They are trying so hard to keep people ignorant. How have the human organ trade, drug trafficking trade, money laundering trade, human slave trade, wall street robbery, bank bail outs, these are done in dollars. Thats why we cant trace the sources and methods of these trades and tactics. These trades are far more dangerous to preform under bitcoin than the us dollar. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:45:49
Definetly blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:12:13
Your math is correct. the US dollar is worth about 5 cents on the dollar. Its lost about 96% of its value since the introduction of the IRS, so a dollar was 1 dollar 1913, it is now 5 cents from that same dollar in 1913. Nice math.

Disgusting. Its a stark reality when a prominent public official has the courage to say such a disgusting comment like this.

You may be correct in your assessment,  but that would require a far more friendly world towards crypto. That scenario is probably 2-4 years away, if it happens at all. Btc is adaptable and has survived for 4 years already. The tech is here to stay without a doubt, we just dont know if bitcoin is msn explorer or google.....

The average person your referring to is a Western style person, which in fact is not the average person. The average person is significantly poorer an has an equally significantly less access to banking systems of any kind, yet alone any entity which isn't above corruption. Bitcoin solves a massive problem, it will be adopted one way or another because the need for it is so tremendous. 
EDIT: What I mean by bitcoin being adopted is the technology behind it, not bitcoin itself, although I should make clear I do believe it will be bitcoin. Yes its a believe and its my opinion. But if not bitcoin something similar without a doubt. We're an adaptive species, despite the best efforts by authority to stop our advance forward through the millennia, we are still advancing and will continue to do so.

Sorry for your lost but be thankful it was a small amount. In 2013 I was scammed out of 2 bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-01 03:37:33
Do you live in America?
@_date: 2015-07-29 07:42:30
Woah!!! Can you provide your source???
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:25:13
I downloaded it, ran it offline with ubuntu off a USB stick. BIP 38'ed it as well. Should be very secure, but don't send from those wallets, only receive. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 03:57:56
SURPRISE! 
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:46:24
What? I'm honestly not sure how you came to feel that way. Technological unemployment is a real thing for cab drivers, it makes perfect sense to defend them until we have a system by which they won't be thrown out in the streets &amp; their families go hungry. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:12:40
This is a great idea! The only person running that has a track record of fighting for the working class. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:40:34
MMMMM, I love the sound of legacy systems destroying themselves!

Hilliary voted for the Iraq war, was in favor of NAFTA, is in favor of the TPP, railed hard against gay marriage as recently as 2007, voted for the patriot act. There is someone in the election that was right on all these topics
@_date: 2015-07-20 06:54:24
How much can you earn? Is this game fun though?
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:35:09
Lol hilarious!

We obliviously dis-agree as to the impact he made, especially with him leading the Stop the War coalition among other worthwhile causes. No one can topple the corrupt political establishment in a day, month, or year. The fact you seem to think so, as well as your obvious contempt, indicts to me you're uninformed or worse. 
In a country where people keep electing politicians that want to ban encryption, waste pubic funds on trident nuclear submarines, allow the UK to become the new cayman islands, kick undesirables out of their homes; I often wonder how someone who is even remotely informed on current affairs would turn on their own. Keep electing morons, it's working out great for the UK. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 07:37:54
You're absolutely wrong. Galloway railed long &amp; hard against the illegal middle eastern wars of aggression, against the massive flow of untaxed money into the UK from other countries which has out priced the locals, hes been against disastrous austerity and the neo-liberal economic assault; I mean the list literally goes on &amp; on. He fights for the people &amp; has railed hard against the corrupt establishment his whole life; naturally that will ruffle some feathers. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:41:23
I'm not getting paid to be a shill. Someone needs a refund! C ya! Have fun getting ignored.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:49:11
Watching them invert themselves backwards is great. They have no idea how to deal with this. I think they understand that money is about to get out of their control.
@_date: 2015-07-29 08:05:30
Attention seeking behavior?? Really??? I feel like you could hide your contempt with better language. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:17:31
What color will you get?
@_date: 2019-12-07 22:06:21
That was a fun read
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:01:32
Can you post details about this?
@_date: 2015-07-29 07:39:44
Naturally you provide no sources to your claims. Absurd claims. Decide for yourself 
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:10:11
Incredible how un informed this person is.... Modern economic theorist.... 
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:08:40
When uber is destroying the local cab economy its the correct move. You can't just throw thousands of people off their livelihoods without considering all factors. You have to reform the political organs to allow for the technological unemployment. The fact you seem to dismiss that indicates you have no idea about this problem.
@_date: 2015-07-17 04:35:35
I wish that prize meant something. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:08:17
Whats your problem? 
@_date: 2019-04-09 04:55:34
Such a bad idea
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:08:53
Your 100%. Libya was literally in the process of creating a common African currency backed by gold &amp; was implementing it before he was overthrown. US logistical, military &amp; air support toppled his government. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:04:27
Is this legit?
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:28:01
I'm 99.9% in
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:30:15
That is pretty much a rite of initiation
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:07:05
Yes, the money you deposit in the bank is the banks. They promise to return it, and in the vast majority of cases they do. Sometimes they don't though, especially during banking crisis
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:11:00
Its chilling they froze those accounts. Far far to much power. So glad I live in the age of BTC
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:31:54
How much is money worth to your business? If your anything  like an ordinary business establishment, your probably paying anywhere from 1.8% to 2.5% in credit card transactions PER transaction. Imagine if you could add that 2.5% profit to your margins simply by saying GOODBYE to your worthless(ie COSTLY) credit card transactions! Its that easy with Bitcoin, a digital token of value which is transmitted over the internet, much like your credit card transactions, except without a middle man (and no 2.5% transaction cost!) Too good to be true? Well, it does cost something, less then 1 penny per transaction. Its also a little bit different then your credit card transactions, payments are instantaneous and there are no charge backs! Want to learn more? I thought so, who wouldn't want to add 2.5% to their margins in this economy, especially if its as easy as pie, which it is! Simply google "BitPay, accepting bitcoins for business." You won't be disappointed! 
* Hope people like this ::)
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:37:33
False. I've cracked my own BIP38 passphrase, albeit, I had the majority of the passphrase
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:39:00
I don wan et

LOVE BTC. Cant wait to see where this is in 10 years!
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:18:20
Totally forgot about these cockroaches
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:36:37
I cracked my BIP38 passphrase using python a few years back. I only had 2 Bitcoin in it. I had 95% of my passphrase though. If you feel certain you have about 90% of the passphrase and it's possible length, I can give it a try. We can have a face chat or confirm anyway you want if you decide to take this offer.
Edit: FYI, I'm a software QA engineer &amp; blockchain developer
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:21:09
The banks are the worst criminals of all. We need to end them once and for all. They are vermin and scum

I loveeeee BTC!
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:21:53
I'm shocked the banks would engage in criminal behavior/enterprise /s

For a better more humane world! 
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:10:07
Thank you! 
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:54:25


thats the only way to crack the passphrase though. No other way other than knowing a significant amount of it in the first place, unless its a weak passphrase, which literally defeats the purpose of BIP38
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:36:08
Im amazed at our luck! To be born in the time of the internet is amazing! But also to be around for the beginning of bitcoin is just unreal. We are witnessing a transformation of our economic, social, &amp; political pillars. Just as I could have never imaged how radically the internet changed the world since 1990, I cant imagine where we might be in 2025 due to bitcoin. All aboard!  
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:39:20
I hope so. I don't have many bitcoins but the ones I own are in a bip38 cold storage wallet and I don't plan on touching them for atleast 10 years 
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:26:37
Awww, you think im pretty :) thank you! 
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:17:54
Thank you! 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:58:26
They have no right what so ever. Furthermore, ask yourself if Congress represents the people, which would lead to the logical assertion that the answer to that question is in fact a resounding no. Thus, it amounts to taxation without representation.

Its easy to make money when the Federal Reserve (private company) can just print the money they need to pay back.

IDK why people assume these are fakes. We need experts to evaluate these findings before we cast judgements.

Why would this matter at all? 
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:58:43
Yes, 21. A little more then half way there

Hmmmm. Analysis checks out, can confirm, am a tea leaf.
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:50:12
I agree but the longer that this Bitcoin experiment goes without a DAO event the odds the decimal place moves in the right direction become greater 
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:57:59
Absolutely I am. This feels like something big and I am holding all the way
@_date: 2016-07-07 16:13:07
Wooahhh, unnecessary hostility fellow redditor

This made me lol

I suspect that more than a 50x increase will take place over the next 4 years. I am continually shocked and stunned at the rate of innovation going on. When I buy and hodl bitcoin I know that I have thousands of highly intelligent and motivated people who truly believe in this project working on it. That's an investment I am 100% proud of. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 01:53:01
Awesome!

Thank you for posting it
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:30:53
Not sure about the down votes. What you said is true. There would have to be a global ban on such DAC's, which is unlikely and frankly probation ineffective in the long run. Isnt there a global war on drugs?  Ask your average college student how hard it is to get drugs.

Hmmmm, very compelling evidence
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:29:31
The only risk is that the exchange essentially and literally owns your bitcoins because they own the private keys. So yea, good luck getting the bitcoins back if anything happens to the exchange platform your using. I would love to use my bitcoins like this but I simply cant trust exchanges. My coins have been collecting dust for about 3 years now

I bought all the way down and will continue to do so because I believe in this technology and its potential. I hope it hits the 200-300 but I dont think anyone will see this price range again, ever.
