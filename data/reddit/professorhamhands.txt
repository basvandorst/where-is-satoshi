Yes the meth comes across our southern border and travels to the meth capital of America, Michigan.
Fucking think about that for a minute.
Of the top ten states with the highest meth usage only California touches the southern border. With more than 50 million people you’d expect them to be higher than they are on the list. 
You provided proof that is given by the executive branch of the government. The same branch with the stated goal of strengthening the border. What did you think you would find?

Perhaps empty is too strong, let’s call them less than full.

The exposure to and establishment of Bitcoin derivatives is a fools errand.
How can an asset revolutionize finance if all it does is bend and squeeze to fit into the shit system that exists? The current financial system depends on control. Right now, the people who control the global financial system cannot exercise control over Bitcoin, and they are admitting it.

You can read right?
Derivatives of Bitcoin are not Bitcoin.
We can “what if” all day long but unless you can tell me how to take a bitcoin futures contract and transfer it’s Bitcoin value to my wallet and then send it to someone else through the Lightning Network, we aren’t talking about Bitcoin. We’re talking about derivatives, which by definition are not the asset they represent. 
If I gave you a piece of paper that said it was a derivative of a Tesla and then claimed that electric car usage was increasing based on that, you’d tell me I was absolutely fucking retarded.
Derivatives are not adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:03:10
So, to be clear, your saying it’s a factual statement that the speculation on Bitcoin derivatives directly increases  Bitcoin network usage, even when those contracts are cash settled?
Perhaps, if a speculator is assigned on a contract then they would buy the Bitcoin. But how? Does the CME and CBOE facilitate the on/off ramp between Bitcoin and fiat currency?
Just because trading volumes are high on exchanges doesn’t mean that the Bitcoin network is growing. I can open thousands of Binance accounts and use bots to drive volume all over the map. That doesn’t mean anything for the actual use of Bitcoin.
If you want to stick with your buying sushi analogy, I’d like to see you try to buy sushi with a futures contract.

No. A reference to “drinking the Kool-Aid” is actually historically based in the cultish behavior surrounding the Jonestown massacre at the hands of the Reverend Jim Jones. One of his last acts was to pass out cups of Kool-Aid laced with cyanide to his followers. The rest is history.
You using the reference that stemmed from a cult mass suicide/murder as a way to deflect the truth about a President that you seem to blindly support is ironic.

You lack the proper mental faculties to differentiate valid from invalid source material. So no matter what I say, you’ll cop out with a “you’re getting that from the MSM talking point.”
There is no point in arguing with you, just like there’s no point in trying to teach a fish to walk a dog. Both things are inherently stupid. 
You say Trump is less corrupt then deflect to others as if to say “See! They also did bad stuff!” As if that excuses the fact that Donald Trump is quite obviously a Russian asset, whether he knows it or not is debatable, which it fucking doesn’t. Using false equivalencies to justify the wrong doings of “your guy” is literally retarded.
Fish cannot walk out of water, well most fish, and certainly all fish lack the capacity to restrain a four legged mammal on land. So it would pointless to attempt to train a fish to walk a dog. One could say, it would be retarded to do so.

Your need to make this political is disturbing. 
Which direction, left or right, prefers corporate prisons, strict borders, and government presence in personal choice? 
Oh, freedom from fear of imprisonment at the hands of corporate interest is leftist. Belief that a government should not have the right to restrict the movement of people is leftist? And thinking that the government shouldn’t have a say whether or not I have a child or decide to have coitus outside of biblical norms is democratic socialism?
How has capitalism faired? 
Have you read The Wealth of Nations?
If so, you must be aware that Adam Smith believed the generational transfer of wealth was unnatural.
One could argue that capitalism, which is what we use for government despite the belief that we have some sort of democracy, has faired as well as Benito Mussolini had expected corporatism to fair.  
In fact it has done so well indeed that someone sought to undermine the foundation of our more than century long monetary hegemonic slave control system.  Or did I miss something?  
It would seem to me that you’re just a statist cuck who whole heartedly believes that the conservative government you elect cares about you.

Just because a miner makes the blocks doesn’t mean that a full node doesn’t have a say in network consensus rules.
Who do you think confirms the mined blocks when the miners go on to working on the next block?
Do you not remember NOS2X and UASF? That was full nodes not allowing miners to take control of the network.
Everything is there in the white paper, you’re just not reading the whole thing.

This would be an example of free market capitalism.
The company is refusing service to a sad example of a human, in order to maintain the perceived integrity of the system in which they operate.
Whether or not the nazi wants to use bitcoin is up to him. Coinbase isn’t preventing him from doing so. Coinbase is preventing him from using their service. They are simply not willing to have his name associated with their brand.
Are you of the attitude that corporations should be forced by law to provide services to all individuals, regardless of who they are or what they say or do?
Your comment exposes more about you than you likely intended.

I see what you are saying. What I am saying, is that despite the fact that non-mining nodes do not generate block headers or publish new blocks to the network, they do confirm them.
NANO non voting nodes have to delegate a node to vote for them. The voting is what decides the correct order of transactions and is how consensus is maintained. 
In Bitcoin, the network of non mining nodes has some degree of power over the miner. 
In NANO the non voting node has to surrender any kind of power to a representative they are trusting to act in their best interest. 
The problem is, as I previously stated, an exchange - Binance -, currently has 25% of the voting power in NANO simply because they have a lot of coins.

But it can’t vote against a consensus change or a block rewind. The voting nodes decide on that.
It will have to accept the network as it is presented to it by the voting nodes or get removed from the network.
Even worse non voting nodes have to delegate to a node with enough weight to vote, based entirely on trust.

You should do some research on the origins of the terms liberal and conservative. 
One demanded freedom from monarchic rule while the other supported the continued concentration of power amongst the wealthy.
I understand current day conservatives are in favor of small government. It doesn’t get much smaller than a monarch or dictator.
Regardless, corporations aren’t humans.
Only an absolute fucking imbecile would try to make that point.
Corporations are allowed to do what they like with regard to banning people they feel are bad for business. It’s odd though that most people who are bad for business are “conservative” isn’t it.
Bunch of statist jackboot licking cucks.

Non mining nodes in Bitcoin, decide which blocks are valid.
Non voting nodes in NANO accept which blocks they are told are valid.

I was called an evangelist for wearing a BTC shirt. I'll still wear it. 
Keeping Bitcoin a dark secret is one of many contributing factors to limited adoption.
You are doing a good thing and you seem to be staying safe about it, right on man!

All mining and non mining full nodes vote on network consensus.
The mining nodes generate the blocks, the full nodes confirm them.
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:16:32
In the NANO network, a non-voting node has no power.
The NANO voting nodes decide network consensus. Non-mining full nodes enforce the Bitcoin network consensus.
Why is this so hard for you to grasp?

For all the naysayers:
1.) Greyscale Bitcoin Investment Trust is an SEC registered asset that trades under the ticker GBTC.
2.) During the month of April they purchased 21% of all newly mined Bitcoin.
3.) They are traded OTC which makes them available to tax advantaged accounts i.e., Roth IRA.
4.) The shares are traded at a premium and right now the GBTC price reflects roughly $11k BTC price.
5.) This is the ONLY market traded asset that is backed with actual Bitcoin and available to regular as well as institutional investors.

I agree with you.
In this instance though, we know what kind of "ideas" Milo has. Being proactive in this regard helps Coinbase to maintain their brand equity. And, if they are seen extinguishing the ability of a known white supremacist to participate on their platform, it will likely be more broadly appealing to the public at large.
