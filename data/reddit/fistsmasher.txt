Adults should know how to handle it. Adults don't complain about bullies

Come on, these people are adults. Let's not pretend they are on a playground

Is it not risky to link a bank account to circle or coinbase? It seems counter intuitive to allow such access with what bitcoin represents.

Thank you. This helped a lot. Funny how much more conversation on makes sense now.

Can someone please explain the bearwhale thing a bit better to me? Why did the price stick at 300 for so long last night? What tactic does someone use to manipulate the market to keep it at a certain price?
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:40:50
I hope you're joking.

I am now seeing a lot of recommendations here to buy from coinbase and circle. Is the advantage with those just that it is more convenient? Why not just buy from a true exchange? Does it make a difference on low vs. high volume?

Do you really have to put a star for a letter? Grow up

This is a terrible explanation

Hearn* why is that so hard
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:22:02
Hearn* twice now

So are we to expect that we aren't able to withdraw any funds left in cryptsy at this point?

So Mike is now pure evil? What happens when the lord and saviors Andresen or Ver or Voorhees or any others decide to quit, whether legitimate or not? Does the bitcoin community suddenly flip the script on these guys as well? You lose a lot of credibility when you start painting Hearn to be a bad guy, when before he quit he was a knowledgeable proponent. 
There's nothing wrong with deciding to leave something you lose the passion for. There *is* something wrong with backtracking on a guy you once got behind, and now are turning against. It's childish. And it represents in a nutshell the drama that has been behind bitcoin for the last 6 months.

That helps. "Application platform" sounds vague but I think I get the idea. I gather there is a lot you can do with it to pay for services so that's probably why it's vague. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 14:04:53
why not?

By posting here, you are keeping him in "power". MOVE ON. It might take a while but find another subreddit, another medium, something. He can't censor what he doesn't have control over. People complaining about his reign and then allowing him to delete your complaint is just retarded.

Ignoring the self promotion and revolution talk.

What is the purpose of setting up and running a full node? Is it anything more than helping the technology and is it helping significantly at all?
