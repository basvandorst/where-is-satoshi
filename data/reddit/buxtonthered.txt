They aren't really emulating the Oyster card - you can now use contactless payment cards in lieu of Oyster cards.
It just so happens that "being a mobile-app debit card" gives you the convenience of using in place of Oyster cards.

Dual UK-Switzerland, or something like that.
Given the HMRC (UK tax) decision, I believe they're tilting towards a UK-centric setup.
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:37:03
Tx fees are also much easier to get a feel for in Doge, because the fee is set at Ð1 per kb of tx size.
Personally I would be extremely content if Doge were $0.001 per each, so literally "ten a penny" (well, ten a cent...).
I'm hatching some paper-wallet software plans which will be natively Big-Three ready (BTC/LTC/DOGE), building on top of the Bitcoin Address Utility's source, so it makes sense for me to keep up with all three.
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:20:17
Yep, Doge is gently inflationary by design because it's intended to be a live currency for active spending rather than a long-term investment vehicle.
Coins get lost into the void (non-backed-up loss of privkeys), so it's not a bad thing for there to be an ongoing in-flow of new value to the system. Ditto it's better for there to be a greater long-term incentive for miners, in my opinion.
I'm playing with all of the big three (BTC/LTC/DOGE), because they have a lot in common technically and complement one another nicely. I started off in Bitcoin, made a small profit when I suddenly remembered I had some when BTC started to take off, and moved my last remaining fraction of BTC over to DOGE because I wanted to play in their world for a bit. Then came back to BTC as it was easiest for getting paid for some BTC-related programming work I did, and diversified out to LTC because I can now merge-mine LTC and DOGE together with my little Scrypt rig (3 x gridseed).
I saw a lovely turn of phrase in someone's post today, describing Doge as being a potential "on-ramp" to help lead people in to BTC. Whether that ends up being literally true or not, I think it's a generally good thing for there to be a few different leading coins with different community natures and economic configurations. On the shibe-side we try to be massively welcoming and warm towards newcomers - and pretty much all of the knowledge they collect from us is equally applicable to BTC and LTC, so they can play across multiple coins without much re-learning.
I would far rather people be thinking "should I use BTC, LTC or DOGE?" than "should I use BTC or paypal?"!

If they've taken control of the servers sufficiently to be able to seize the .onion Hidden Service address, it's not unreasonable to accept that they've also got the BTC private keys.

Yep, and plugins for Firefox, Chrome and even IE on the Windows side. Makes it very easy to share the same password storage between your local browsers.

The "one hour" thing is based on waiting for the gold standard of six confirmations, which is regarded as making a double-spend attack effectively impossible.
For lower-value transactions, it's not unusual for a service provider to accept a lower number of confirmations.
I believe Bitpay guarantee payments as soon as they see the transaction on the blockchain and take the potential risk of a double-spend - so any merchant using them would not be waiting very long at all.

I got in at $108 (well, actually £67 [GBP]), as the quickest route open to me as a Brit was Bittylicious.
I only went in for 1 BTC - partly because that's the max that Bittylicious would sell me as a new client (signed in and registered but not otherwise verified), and also because of the "only as much as you're willing to lose" principle.
I'm not fussed about trying to sell them on again later for a profit (unless, y'know, we get in to ~$200 territory again!) - I figure it as being a lucky break to buy some BTC at a transient discount. (The Bittylicious rate is up to about £77 [GBP] already, and that's not a huge fast-moving exchange in comparison)

Sure - but thanks to UK services who are able to make use of FP, we can buy bitcoin with potentially a 1-hour turnaround via Bittylicious.
It's not "fiat's fault" that the USA does not have modern financial institutions.
@_date: 2013-10-12 22:12:45
I see it the other way around - if the world operated like this, the barrier to entry to get in to bitcoin would be greatly reduced - allowing merchants to get more transactions through bitpay or the like.

Depending on how efficiently you can route XBT out to local fiat, the effective cost of handling may be quite a pain in the arse.
It would be easier for properly-evil pimps at the seedy end of the market, because they could at least buy the necessary crack for their "ladies" directly in XBT.

They only launched today (Monday 30 September), so it will probably take a little while for people to hear of it and start participating.
It looks promising at first glance, in terms of a nice simple interface making it easy to figure out their fees and so on. They're taking their KYC/AML stuff seriously which is good for legitimacy and hopefully indicates they won't get slapped down by the UK government too readily.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:56:52
You have to seize the private key that backs the hidden service address, which is a damn sight harder than getting a court order against a traditional domain registrar but still entirely possible.
@_date: 2013-09-20 19:44:20
You should spend the value out of the paper wallet's account in to your own, then perform transactions from there. Otherwise you can have problems with change addresses, as I understand it.

There's IBWT except it's got very low uptake.
I bought some (well, 1.0 BTC exactly) from Bittylicious during the SR-DPR price drop, but that doesn't feel like a traditional exchange. It's very much aimed at buyers of BTC, with sellers being a "contact us" side note. Process was pretty smooth and easy, but the price seems to be a premium above the offers on LocalBitcoins.

I was more thinking of a straightforward "takes btc, doesn't send items, blames international post for losing item" thing.

I got in to Bitcoin initially via the Virwox exchange - I traded some SLL (Second Life Linden$) for BTC back when they weren't worth much, and have made about 700GBP in selling them more recently.
(Yes, I *am* regularly wishing I'd bought more back then!)
The SLL currency is extensively regulated and micro-managed by Linden Labs, to the point where they "bless" certain exchanges but impose extra rules and requirements (like, you can't sell SLL through any approved 3rd-party exchange - only LL's official one). They mint more SLL centrally as and when they feel like and all transactions go through their systems.
SLL is basically Linden Labs's own fiat currency, which just happens to be for their online world.

A wallet is a collection of the private keys for bitcoin addresses. The address itself IS the matching public key. (it's Effectively Impossible to calculate the matching Private key if you know a Public key)
At any given moment, any fully-synced user of a "heavy" client (like the main bitcoinqt "official" app) knows the Bitcoin balance of every address, and the history of the transactions between them. (But, they don't know WHOSE addresses they are.)
When a transaction happens, your client "signs" it with the Private key that matches the Address the funds are coming from. All of the other peers on the network (other people running bitcoin qt, the Miners, service providers and exchanges) can all verify that the signature was made by the "owner" of the funds.
If you lose your wallet file completely, the Bitcoins in those addresses become stranded - they can't move! There's no "bank" who can declare it to be a "dormant account", the money just won't move around in the economy again.
If your wallet were not encrypted and someone stole it, they can send the funds to somewhere else (transfer to other addresses) and you can't "undo" that.
Your money is not literally "in" your wallet file, but that's a good-enough metaphor for general use. You can make a million copies of it, but they're all tied together. (It's more "copy an ATM card" than "copy a paper banknote", if you're after a metaphor to understand the copying thing.)
You can switch approaches, use both, as you see fit - but you may have to pay a small tx fee (transaction fee) depending on the history of your funds, so it's not necessarily free to keep moving BTC around different storage locations (i.e. between different addresses managed by different local or online wallets). 
I use bitcoin qt locally for most of my storage (I don't have much!), but also have a wallet on Blockchain with a little bit in it - which I use with the bitcointip bot.
If you're using coinbase or blockchain, your login to those is the sensitive thing. If using local client (either the "full" bitcoin qt, or a lightweight one like electrum), then your wallet file and the passphrase you chose to secure it are the weak-spots.

Use a backup service which retains previous versions of files for a while, such as Carbonite.
Carbonite is also nice because it is set+forget - runs on automatic in the background.

No, a large amount of Local Bitcoins transactions happen entirely online - it all depends on the payment method used for the traditional-money side ("fiat" if you're so inclined).
They offer an online escrow which helps keep buyer and seller safe from each other and gives the whole thing a decent amount of trust and feelings of robustness.
In the UK my bank offers a very quick and reliable payment app for "sending money to a mobile phone" (and receiving) - you register your number with them so they can associate it with the regular bank account. I have sold BTC twice with that now. (My only regret now is deciding to sell when I did!!)
Depending on how quick local bank transfers can move where they are, your family may be able to easily-enough sell purely online through Local Bitcoins. It may give them a better effective rate (and quicker withdrawal) than Bitstamp, but then again maybe not.

A few people have reviewed LastPass's security model and it's apparently good. Your passwords are encrypted with your master password/phrase, THAT does not get sent itself to LastPass (it gets hashed client-side and that hash sent), so LP cannot actually access the contents of your personal Vault themselves.
There are ways one could think of to attack that model, but it a pretty decent starting point.

@_date: 2013-11-14 18:03:43
Arguably, you could, because there would be a strong moral argument for those collaborators to publish their own lists of addresses in order to justify their data (in terms of being able to see the transaction from Alleged Mr Smith's Address, to claimed-by-collaborator address).

"Swipe" in this context means a Cardholder Present transaction.
A transaction where the card does not present directly at the merchant's terminal is CNP - Cardholder Not Present. Everything done online or by phone is CNP.
Square don't (AFAIK) offer Chip-and-Pin - but the USA doesn't properly use that yet, so over there "swipe" has the same meaning as "Cardholder Present".
But yeah, they should stop saying "swipe", because that sounds prehistoric to UK/Euro users.

I'm still in the middle of reading it so there may be more relevant info I haven't gotten to yet. I don't think it's likely that someone on SR/DPR's "side" would post a seizure notice formatted like that. Given my understanding of the degree of server-compromise the FBI achieved, I currently accept the narrative that they posted that message.
