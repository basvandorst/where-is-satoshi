What do you mean by crash? 
1 BTC is worth 1 BTC yesterday. 
1 BTC is worth 1 BTC today.
1 BTC will be worth 1 BTC tomorrow.

Make sure you get enough % in fiat that pays you for your living. 
Keep 1-2 month worth of fiat as backup just in case. 
Make sure you're paid whatever % of BTC equivalent  at least bi-weekly if not weekly.  Stick to date of payments regardless of fluctuations in btc value. 
Keep strict stop losses max 5-10%. Raise stop loss line in bull market frequently. 
Prefer LTC or other crypto that has cheaper TX costs with faster confirmations and exchange to btc in trades. 
Put 50% of crypto income to dips you find now and then and exit all trades with 1-2% gains. It's okay if that shitcoin does 5x after your exit. You're not into crypto for full time trading, this is for the sake of managing potential losses with these consistent minor gains. 
If you plan to get paid in crypto and just HODL, you probably be having a better life with fiat. 
When it comes to taxes, I would prefer to pay taxes when I convert crypto to fiat. And only pay taxes for amount of fiat converted. Reason because no government is going to recover my crypto if it gets doxed.
Another idea: More better get a company credit card to spend for your living. And get paid whatever post your cc bill in crypto. Company can claim your expenses as business expense. And you're not liable for tax. Note that this will give credibility to company but you will be completely out of any banking credibility.  Go ahead if you think you can survive future without banks.

If you don't have money to buy more, sell your services/labour in trade of BTC rather in Fiat.
