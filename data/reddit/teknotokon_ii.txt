Hey, if I end up getting an extra paycheck in January, and that's usually about a touch over 600, do you think me splitting 200 into savings, 200 into my other retirement savings, and 200 into Bitcoin would be a good idea? I was thinking of doing a small test transaction first, but I'm def. thinking of doing 200 this coming January.

True. If you invest regularly, how much do you put in, if I may ask?

Yeah, the adage of time in the market beats timing the market def. rings true. I wanted to buy some more this month but holy hell was christmas shopping expensive.

Honestly, I'm not looking to get super loaded or anything - If I do, then hell yeah! My only goal is to help Dad get out of debt, help fund college, or just even have some spending cash. I dunno man, I'm actually really interested now.

See, I really don't like timing the market like that, because if I don't buy at regular intervals, I'm possibly missing out on gains and losses, but I do get your point man, I'm just trying to figure out a strategy here.

Aight. I'm pretty much convinced at this point. Y'all got me sold man.

Why not go for broke and go for 69.420?

Yeah. I usually have about 600~ or so a month after all my expenses, so I was thinking of doing 100 a month, and during months where I get paid 3 times, doing like 150 into bitcoins

So enough to provide me a decent chunk of change, right? Hell, if I can let it sit for a couple of years, and get about 6000~ or so in interest, I'd be happy.

I ain't broke at all man, I save 600 a month on average, and some months I get paid three times.  so 100 a month is no sweat off my nose.
