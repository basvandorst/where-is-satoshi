In 2014 when we were looking to people like Thiel to get on the band wagon. Here he says he will get interested when payment volume increases. At that time we were all thinking about buying coffee not wall street interest. So that still hasn't happened but here he is now

Seems hard to do right now because all the searches show his recent enthusiasm for bitcoin but roll it back a few years and he was saying that it was a failed experiment.

Note to all you enthusiasts out there. Peter bought bitcoin while he was dismissing it. That's how big investors actually behave. They talk down what they are buying and talk up what they are selling. Or buy low sell high, right? I wonder what all those other Wall Street types who are dismissing bitcoin are really doing.

It's about cherry picking the time frames. If you look at lightcoin today it went up almost  25% in a few hours (2-2.5). That is undoubtedly the fastest it has run in quite a while. But if you zoom out a bit and look at a bigger time frame it's not so impressive.

2) It seems that a stop gap move like going immediately to 2M with a hard fork is meant to answer some questions about doing a hard fork and allowing time for the implementation of other projects in the works.

@_date: 2014-08-13 15:35:18
On a voluntary basis I agree, why not. But I think the innovation of cryptocurrencies may require a rethink of the entire model of taxation. We shouldn't try to fit the old model into the new system. It means it's time to have a discussion about taxation and what is fair. That has been impossible in the United States since the rise of the market fundamentalists. I think the ice is breaking.

At the moment the rate of bitcoin issuance is inflationary and will be for a hundred years or so. Some of us think that the old capitalistic models of growth may need to come to an end if we're to create a sustainable economy.

It's a very small market. I billion dollars of bitcoin aren't on offer. If there was suddenly a huge demand the price would skyrocket because of their own buying. They will do what they always do.

@_date: 2014-11-14 04:48:24
I want to bring up a way to answer the problem of deflation. The economists seem sure that it would be horrible to have a deflating currency because if would cause savings and prevent consumption. Let me point out a couple things about this. First we have real world examples that contradict this expectation. There is new computer hardware coming out all the time that is better and cheaper than stuff that was around just a while before. There has been no reluctance to buy better computers just because we know they will be better and cheaper later. Second, they insist that you need to inject money into the system to accommodate growth. The current system creates new currency through fractional reserve banking to expand the money supply. This money is basically free to the banks and gives them enormous wealth and power. I understand why they would argue that to be the best of all possible worlds. A deflationary system like bitcoin has to expand to meet growth too but it doesn't do it by increasing the number of coins but rather the value of the coins. This means that the benefit is not given to an elite few but is shared by all who hold the coins. We all get a little raise for growing the economy. It is much more democratic than the old system. Since we can keep moving the decimal of value we can have infinite growth of the value while keeping the nominal number of coins unchanged. It's a revolution and they current monopoly holders are going to try to convince people that it won't work. Let's prove them wrong. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:23:24

@_date: 2014-11-14 18:29:52
Not what I said. Deflationary economies have a history. The last half the nineteenth century in the US was a deflationary economy. It was also a time of booming economic activity. The arguments against deflationary economies usually seek to reinforce the current regime. In the world of central banks, money is debt. It's created and issued as debt. That is not what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:31:55

I like how he throws down the Austrian theory of money like it was proven science. That theory of money is based upon an historic lie (money didn't start as barter, it started as credit) and it absolutely can't explain the emergence of bitcoin. When was bitcoin a commodity before it became money?
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:38:22
You know the government isn't really a "thing". It's not a person or a magical monster. It's a collection of people, traditions and laws. Believe it or not, we the people of American are actually part of the government of America. And some of us embrace bitcoin. Some powerful people at the Fed and in the Treasury are thinking this could be a huge cultural/technological/financial event and they want to see what happens. The few who will try to shut it down will probably react too late and they will have other members of the government fighting against them.
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:48:39
He also paid for coins that had been effectively sanitized by the government possession. That means in the absence of clear regulations there is some uncertainty about coins that you buy from an exchange. You don't know for instance if they might be part of the missing Gox coins or other criminally tainted coins. This 30k was definitely tainted but when the government sold them they put their weight behind them and washed any stains away.

I think on a certain level it is. Fiat is latin for "make it so" or "let it be done". Fiat currency is called such because it derives its value from the decree of some capricious body like a king or a central bank. In the case of bitcoin the declarative force is not a human, its a mathematical/code construct. It's not backed by gold or some physical thing. It's backed by the integrity of that construct.

Yea, I agree. The Maidsafe people are saying that they can transfer value just like bitcoin but that it stays anonymous. So bitcoin for government/business and entirely transparent and safecoin for people who deserve privacy. I think this would mean that only businesses would pay taxes, or individuals conducting business, but that individuals would be left alone.

Well it would be a small group now when so few people hold bitcoin. If it becomes widely adopted then it would be basically the entire economy that expands lockstep with the value of money.

It isn't much of an improvement today, except that it undermines a banking industry that is abusive. In the longer time frame, bitcoins will become more broadly used and necessarily more broadly distributed. Then as the value of the economy goes up and no new coin can be added the value of all coins has to go up. The fundamental mistake in the deflationary scare argument is that unlike gold or other deflationary currencies, bitcoins can move decimal points.

As a parent I find your cynicism misplaced. You try to get the kids involved in things that you think are important for them. Of course they're not going to grok it all. People who raise their kids in religion don't wait until they've graduated college to introduce the idea of god. You show them early what matters to you and what you think should matter to them.

Well because the financial group may not trust each other. What if they're trading something like debt swaps. In the financial crisis it was the failure of trust that caused the liquidity crisis. If it had been traded on a blockchain they could know the counter-party risk. If these things could be traded in a trustless environment we could avoid the crisis, still allow them to use sophisticated financial tools but not bring down the whole system.
edit to clarify, they may not trust other members of their own group. It's a competitive environment.
edit again because well it's late. Think of WW1. The real problem is they didn't know each other's commitments. They didn't know each other's treaties. They stumbled into war because that information was private. Had they seen the table it never would have happened. That's what the banks did.

It would be a great way to implement a universal minimum income. Every month some amount of new coin is issued to each citizen. Steps would have to be taken to offset the inflationary aspect of that and we'd have to offset it will some real assets to keep the economy afloat but it's a goal to be considered.

Don't think of the supply as bitcoins but smaller units. A single bitcoin can be broken down to 100million smaller units. We won't ever move the decimal point to increase the total number of bitcoins because we have an enormous supply of smaller coins. The only way that works is if the value of each coin goes up.
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:16:59

How about using bitcoin as the decentralized clearing house for sidechains. So each bank or financial group would use their own sidechain until they want to transfer assets to another group and that transaction would take place on the bitcoin blockchain.

Yea in the US we hear all the stories because free speech means crazy shit is okay to say, and to ridicule. I think there is some pretty compelling evidence that the official story is more or less true. They were obviously bad people and it's weirdly academic to argue if the were worse than Stalin or Mao or Pol Pot. Is somebody giving out merit badges or something?
I was kind of wondering if the Swiss had some stories of their secret involvement or running an underground railroad or something like that.

I used to do a lot of stock trading but I wasn't very good at it. One of the things I did learn was how easy it is for big players to manipulate thinly traded vehicles like bitcoin. If somebody wants in they have lots of dirty tricks they can use. Selling into dips to make them worse and hope to cause a panic can create opportunities for buying more than you just sold and at a lower price. Keep playing that day in and day out to build your position rather than just buying at once. That's how you accumulate shares at low prices if you've got the money to play the game. You are right though, eventually buying will affect the price but it doesn't always have to be your price of purchase.

I see what you are saying. But the inflation rate is dropping dramatically. Look at the graph.
So in ten years the annual inflation of bitcoin goes from the current 10% to a little less than 1%. I don't really think bitcoin could take 10% of the gold market in that short time but if the price did go to 50K by then blocks will be worth 3.125 BTC each.  3.125/10 minutes or 18.75 BTC an hour and 450/day. 450x50,000 = which is 22 million a day in a market of 18,000,000 BTC with a market cap of 900Billion. That doesn't seem so crazy to me- except for the part of it actually ever getting to 50K.

Well Mr prickly, I'm not suggesting anybody decide. But those of us who want to open up the use of the blockchain may not want to pay a transaction fee in bitcoin everytime I tip a song.

I think this curve describes the hype around a new technology. It doesn't have to correlate with price. Price is a new feature of bitcoin and would follow curves more like a stock or asset. There is no price for "nanotechnology" or "fusion power" but those technologies have gone through hype curves like this one.

I think bitcoin has another competitor besides gold and altcoins. It hasn't materialized yet but the other competitor will be utility.

I think the Chinese are interested in btc for the same reasons as the rest of us. They won't do anything to hurt their investment just because the government says so. The government doesn't really have that sort of power over the people, just  look at the constant social unrest all across China. Bitcoin is a much bigger threat to the government of China and their control of the money supply than the people of China are a threat to bitcoin, their alternative money.

In the current banking system the poor have very few options for saving. They could get a negative return on their checking accounts after fees and fines which happen as a part of being poor. Bitcoin will allow them to just put money in their wallet and it will appreciate over time. At first that appreciation is rapid as we are in the adoption phase. Once that is over the overall value of the bitcoin market cap will expand at the rate the economy expands. In any event, just having a little money will earn you money. No risky stocks or other investments. Bitcoin will benefit all those that use it over time. Rich too.

It would make collecting tax on small transactions very difficult. Big transaction would spark an investigation and that would make large scale money laundering or tax evasion hard to do. The blockchain isn't completely anonymous and if we really wanted to we could track down the parties in a large transaction. Presumably that would not be worth the effort to tax my waitress' tip. What would be taxable is "real" wealth. Things like property or stock or other commodities that are tracked. This would put the burden of taxation squarely on the shoulders of the wealthy--where is belongs IMO. It would set off a class war but push comes to shove we eat the rich.

/bitcoin is a "subreddit" of reddit. There are every kind of subreddit you can imagine. Seriously, don't go look unless you want to find some shit.
I'm not sure about two factor authentication but really if you're doing this for an investment instead of using them to purchase stuff, which is sounds like you are, just put them in a safe place like a real world metal safe and forget about them until you retire.
the authentication system has two keys, a public one that everybody sees on the blockchain (the online ledger of all bitcoin transactions) and then the private key you have. It's in your wallet, when you get one, which by the way you absolutely must passphrase protect, and it allows you to spend the coin and nobody else.

It shocks me that you've missed the obvious. Litecoin is exploding because you can still mine it at home without special equipment. Bitcoin mining has become expensive and hard so those of us in the altcoin revolution who don't have a lot of money are now invested in litecoin. And you need at least one, preferably several, altcoins to allow hedging by trading between altcoins to avoid incurring a fiat trail. We don't want to cash in/out of btc into dollars because then we incur tax and legal ramifications. Stop hating, we're all going to do fine.
