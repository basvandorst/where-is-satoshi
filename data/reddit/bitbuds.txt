excellent idea... the crypto community NEEDS bitfinex.. they are a solid player that made a huge mistake.. but losing them would be a big blue to the crypto world.
This is not the same as Mt Gox.. this is a professional corp that has best of intentions so we should support it. I  would support this proposal if it helps them continue operations.
Make us shareholders etc :)

laughing hysterically at BCH technical "expertise"
bitcoin is a selection process for technical expertise

No we actually need Bitmain cause their mining improves security of BitCoin network.  It would be better if they just didn't impede forward progress of the network (ie: SegWit).  Now that their secret financial incentive to stall has been revealed, they SHOULD adopt segwit once that hole has been patched...

Why not just take the coins and disappear versus doing all these steps?

So they owed a bunch of money on Bitfinex in the form of BfxTokens.  Tethers was created to get real dollars in exchange for Tethers.  Then, the debt on Bitfinex is paid by the USD earned from selling Tethers.  They basically moved the debt from BfXTokens to Tethers.  And they don't officially need to pay back Tethers, or they can do so in a much more controlled manner.

So you patent it to PROTECT yourself.  The ASICSBOOST did in fact work, but they chose NOT to use it "for the greater good".  Yet, you keep it in product which could ultimately be used AGAINST you.

(let's assume this is correct)
This is quite an interesting analysis into HOW they accomplished this.  Quite smart by them to come up with it and by you to uncover it.
I'm also curious about WHY they would do this.  
My hypothesis: They wanted to restore credibility to the BitFinex brand quickly as that would increase revenues and minimize market share loss.  
We already know BitFinex plays a cat and mouse game with banks by having to create multiple companies over the years to keep the money flowing.  Anyone who does business in Asia will know its hard to make banking connections with USA.  This doesn't tell me they are criminal or have ill intent, it just tells me they are creative and willing to push legal boundaries a bit.
I also realized, if they just wanted to steal a bunch of money, they could have done that at many points already.  
So now they have the option to pay back the debt under the Tethers strategy.  I think the legal wording actually allows them to not have to pay anyone, but I think that is just to protect themselves, not actually to rob people.  It's just smart legal stuff.  It's the same reason why companies make you sign a waiver before doing something where you could sue them.   
So it boils down to understanding their true intentions.
Do you think their intention is to fraud people out of their money or do you think they are trying to run a legit bitcoin exchange that ran into some issues, and are coming up with out of the box solutions that kinda work and are barely legal?
I personally think they are legit but I followed your twitter cause you seemed to think the opposite and I think you have genuine concerns and make good arguments.  
Would be interesting to know what you think of my hyopethsis.

Who is Chris Ellis and how is he connected to BitFinex?

Ya the redirection toward Greg seemed out of place.  He didn't even name them in his paper, his claim that the hardware had this built in (which it did).  You'd think they would thank Maxwell for fixing that so that people couldnt use their own hardware against them.

Great question and even better answer!

Ya seems OP has another motive other than true unbiased analysis.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:23:13
They seem unable to think rationally only emotionally
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:05:47
His claim was that this hardware had ASICSBOOST built in.. which Bitmain has now confirmed.   He never claimed they used it (in fact, he said its almost impossible to prove).
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:08:49
Can you address the points I made above?  Or you only willing to assume they  have ill intent?
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:18:36
Why would you take the time to patent ASICBOOST in your home country and also build it into the circuitry of your product and then NOT use it?  
@_date: 2017-04-25 23:52:42
YOU ROCK JIMMY... i'll support your new endeavor
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:09:20
Exactly. They built something into a product they sell that could be used against them WITHOUT them even knowing.  Yet, when you offer a solution to protect against that, they aren't thanking you?

Antpool/Bitmail got targetted because they are the main ones opposing SegWit while most other miners support SegWit....
