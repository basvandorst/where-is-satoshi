can you provide your source? I'm getting conflicting information with some sites saying its a tax on the gain you get from selling it and businesses have to pay an additional 25% tax when accepting Bitcoin since its considered an asset and not a currency

Wow what shopping center is this?

really? I've read otherwise, the articles are somewhat outdated though but "Senior members of the Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department advised that due to lack of existing applicable laws, capital controls and the fact that Bitcoin straddles multiple financial facets... Bitcoin activities are illegal in Thailand"

yah people will be able to invest in the trust by buying/selling shares in it and the trust will hold Bitcoins as the underlying assets, I remember reading something similar about another trust being open. here it is

yah that's fair, Thailand banning it is definitely an attack but the thai economy doesn't really have any effect worldwide. Thailand is also extra cautious because they have a major currency crisis with the Baht before. 
I agree with what Norway is doing and I'm glad they're at least addressing that Bitcoin has become something that should be addressed by governments in terms of classification and taxation. I think it does more good than harm to Bitcoin's credibility. 
China definitely has a huge fear of not being able to control any aspect of their economy/country but those who want to adopt it will definitely find ways around it. Any idea how big the Chinese Bitcoin market was before this attack?

interesting, there seems to be a lot of confusion about this thanks for pointing out your article. Maybe with this China news, Thailand will state its actual stance sooner than later

There's quite a few attacks, France warned investors about the unregulated currency, Norway views it as an asset and not a currency which i think is currently understandable and Thailand has banned the currency. I think the major fear for the US is it's use to in tax evasion since it's anonymous

It's a shame I haven't seen much tipping around reddit unless it was a Bitcoin related link
