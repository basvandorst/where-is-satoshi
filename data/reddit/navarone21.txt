Question, does spending bitcoin on something that you know will probably automatically be dumped for US currency straight away hurt the bitcoin economy much?

Business accumen and ethics should be bookends of a reputable company. Don't be this guy.

I was continuing the conversation you were having with &gt; There's no tradeoff. Businesses exist for one reason, to maximize profits. Assuming there's any sort of ethical consideration is folly. You have to assume that a business will operate in line with its goals, not with your personal ethics.
The ethics of business practice is not folly and should be up for consideration on all decisions the pertain to business. Especially those  practices that are customer facing. 
If money saved by a company by using a algorithm that alienates its customers, or even more worrisome, makes it difficult/ impossible to access their goods/ services. That is an ethical issue that must be considered. 
In a perfect Capitalistic /laissez faire market, I would suppose that the business model of "if you don't like it, go away" is acceptable, but that is not a reality.

And if Maximizing profits means making computers run your front line customer service, you may lose customers.

And that is the wager that comes awful close to the ethics line.

You do not see that having a customer service/ customer facing branch of your company that makes it difficult or impossible for said customers to utilize the goods/services that you are selling as a breach in the companies ethical responsibilities? 
I would say that it is an ethical breach in today's society to take someones money, and make it difficult/ impossible to use their service. Or with less impact to the customer, to offer a service, and make it difficult/ impossible to use their service.
