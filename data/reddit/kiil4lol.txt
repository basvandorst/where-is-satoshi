did you look up your txID or adress?
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:37:43
your send adress is from gdax which has of course many transactions. they put all their money in only a coupld of wallets. When something is deposited in there it gets automaticly sent to the main wallet. (at least that is how i think it worked)

yes but it is all in coinA you can buy coinB, coinC, coinD or coinE, since you get the same value of them. coinA = coinOther - fees. it's all about the buy and sell price of coinA. Then when you buy coin B you realize profits/loss from coinA. Later when you sell coinB you realize profit/loss for coinB you do the same.

yeah so I want to do it as late as possible. i think i paid an averagwe of 6000-7500 and i want to return my initial investment at 6x so that would be at 36k-45k. well high hopesXD
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:40:35
pretty cool to 3d print the rollercoasters. low amounts of bitcoin are really shitty now with the fees unless you keep them on an exchange but then it doesn't matter that its bitcoin because you don't own them. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:44:33
some columnist thinks she would sell her bitcoin if she had one. because she thinks its inevitable that it crashes so it can better crash soon.

I will patent printing dolars. My second patent would then be trading them for "anything" like bread, renting places, labor or services. Anyone that wishes to use "my" dolar now has to pay me a 15% fee.
The 3rd thing I will patent is taxes.

I am for a increase to 2mb. I know we shouldn't increase it too far, but we should agree that this is unacceptable. When LN gets addopted (hopefully soon enough before we get more hype) we can reduced it back to 1mb. We need tech now, not hype and adoption. let the market slow down for some time or it can be our own undoing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:57:15
thnx for the link tho, even if LN also requires bigger blocks, 2mb would be ok, maybe in time 4mb. The point is blocksize can scale along with development in pc's. between now and the time between the start of bitcoin the average pc has improved alot. Therefor I think clamping to the 1mb is unnecesairy. the jump to 8mb or even 32mb is too extreme atm, because it excludes too many to run a node.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:09:28
99% of the time it will be sell, most times after a simple question, how much is it now?
A: 110, wow lets take the profit.
B: 90, O noos money lost quickly sell.
C 11.000 wow many riches, lets sell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:53
I plan to remove my initial investmenst at some point from my btc. This way i make sure i have at least no loses and won't feel sad if it completely crashes (doubt). It really depends how hard you need fiat and how it makes you feel.

where is the as bitcoin futures begin trading bitcoin starts trading horizontally
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:49:39
probably the fee was to low and it's halfway in limbo during the spam attack. If the mempool clears you will get it but it might take a couple of days or longer depending on how much long this bch clown fiasta lasts
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:33:51
why monday? curiosity, has it to do with NEO random pump and announcement of an announcement(wtf is going on there?) or that bch dump starts again?
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:27:23
but if i am correct the mining difficulty gets adjusted. So only the time before the adjustment the network is paralyzed. I don't deny it's an attack and it most likely will work if enough factors support the attack, but its effect will be short term. Before it gets to normal we will have to wait till the next block is mined after the paralize and difficult adjust. maybe it will take longer. the price will dip, but bitcoin will restore and it creates a big awereness in what has to be improved. so it will also help evolve bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-01 19:52:18
so the attack is to get bitcoin's transaction slow for 1 day? will not kill btc, might actually make it stronger. chance of attack happening &lt;1%.

even better. profiting from riding the bch wave and trading back. might have traded back to early tho. who knows. I quess the big bois that stirred up this mess do the same.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:59:20
not sure but in eu the ruling for crypto is that it falls under tax box 3, which means stored value. having more then x value you have to pay tax. (this is different if you are a profesional trader).
If it falls under investments you might even get money back in some cases.
try to find the rules for your country.

apperntly we get free money then. bitcoin forks into bitcoin and bitcoin 2x. If you have bitcoin at the time of the fork. You have the same ammaunt on both chains. It was sheduled the 15th however it was cancelled and later not. still uncertain about this fork

i just wondered what his logic was. Isn't it more logical that when the memepool has cleared a big part of this clown fiasta is cooled down and the price stabalised. I prefer when people give more then only a statement.
Your retoric trying to be offensive remark, nor the time my reddit accaunt exists, nor my username (whatever you might think of it), nor my personal investment in crypto (or for you somehow important in btc), don't add much to the confersation.
next time i will buy a two year old accaunt so you can be pleased.
thnx for helping me answer my question in which we both know you helped immensely.
edit: also your accaunt is younger, get off 0.04btc enthousiast.

yes i understand they are moving to bch.

look at that shiny donate to my bitcoin adress link on your portfolio o boi.
But seriously just ask your clients if they would consider this option. You can't force them, but some could possibly find it super cool.
