When are you going to bitcoin out of cash?

Are you telling me that past performance can be analyzed and that you can figure out future results or future trends?
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:03:34
I already voted YES!
Keep up the good work!

This turned bad rather quickly.

Speaking was your first mistake. Never speak to those thugs.

I did not buy a single TV, iPod, iPad, iPhone, computer or any electronic device in the last 20 years because like all *smart people*, I know that they all drop in value and reach higher quality as time goes by. So I'm always waiting on the next better value electronic to come by before buying. I'm actually sending this message by pigeon-to-reddit-comment service.
*NOT YOU BIATCH* Are you insane?

NSA is a political institution. It makes political recommendations.

Interesting. I just wish PGP was usable.

Have a look at Nxt. It has [a nice decentralized marketplace]( which has been active for a while now.

I don't care if bitcoin is ubiquitous or not.

I like that LMAX architecture. I did a quick glimpse of it but I fail to see how different it is from using standard message queues like RabbitMQ or something else.
Keep up the good work!

Life is a risky thing. You should manage your risks accordingly.

Thanks but I think you used the wrong username.
@_date: 2013-08-17 20:22:35
Maybe later.

By the same logic, if someone gives you a beer, you owe them.
You owe nothing to no one unless you have a contract with them and no, the social contract is not a contract.


You don't. People can get the services they need on their own.

I never paid any fee using Bitcoin-Qt. You can change it yourself by going in the Settings -&gt; Options menu (in the Main tab).
@_date: 2013-09-13 21:08:00
Awesome! I want more!
@_date: 2013-05-26 05:02:06
I'm well aware of that, but thanks.

I love women who use bitcoins!

There is nothing wrong in speculating and cashing out.

You know where it's going right?

Did it hurt your feels?

Life is not idiot proof. Get over it.
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:09:48
What is wrong with that if you can provide some details?

Mac support is still kind of sketchy but some people have been doing work to improve this:

There are basically 2 ways to get what you (or someone else) want: using force and using negotiation or voluntary interactions.
Let say I want your book. I could offer you money, friendship, love, sympathy, help to build your house, anything else in exchange and you would be free to accept or refuse this trade. This would be voluntary or negotiated. The alternative, would be for me to use a gun and tell you "Give me the book or I shoot". This would be force.
Now, can you guess which one is preferable and to which one taxes belong to?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:45:33
This is how most people invested in bitcoin feel about [their big balls](

The straw man is strong with this one.

No, everybody would not "opt in" and that's the whole point. There would be competition for those services. Some people would be able to get them on their own. Some people would use a *private* company for them.

Think my friend. Thinking does solve every problem. Doing is for pussies.

I promise not to post for every cent increases. I cannot promise to not post for every 2 cents increases though.
@_date: 2013-08-18 11:43:52
Thanks a lot!

*investigates* is a strong word. I would have used *talk in favour of*.
