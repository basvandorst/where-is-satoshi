Thanks, if i lower the fees, then it will effect the speed and reliability? Right?

didnt really understand anything of that but, when will this be implemented?

The fees will go down? Why and how much?

But i think the real question is if you believe in the technology, and if you really do i would invest :)

bitcoin is bearish, it will get cheaper soon, buy it when it's cheap (doesn't really matter if you're holding for 5 years but will get you a little extra profit), but most importantly before you invest; i'd do some research about crypto and ask yourself where you see bitcoin in 5 years. I personally think crypto is the future and i'd go for it :)

localbitcoins.com is where i get all my btcs cause im under 18 so coinbase dont allow me to buy, when you get your btcs i'd keep them somewhere safe, a lot of hacks happens. I use the Exodus wallet.

I think most people trade bitcoin to make money at the moment, the fees are at like 2$ so it would be stupid to buy a coffee with the fees beeing more expensive then the actual coffee. Bitcoin was the very first crypto currency so it wouldn't be perfect just like the very first car or plane wasn't perfect. There are altcoins though which suites every day transactions better, but Bitcoin is without a doubt leading the crypto market. We are very early in this whole crypto thing and we're still figuring out things :)
