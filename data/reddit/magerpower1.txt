I can only speak for personal experience; I worked for UNICEF DK, for a while (almost 3 years) and the reason they have a minimum donation amount is the transaction fees. They dont want peoples donations to get eaten up by bank and monetary services....
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:51:59
Although tipping charities is a great thing and it will propably generate alot of goodwill towards Bitcoin and the generousity of the community, i still thinks the best way to spread knowledge of this new technology is to tip people who can reach users and promote it.
What i mean is that charities already is donation-based. They already have donation-systems set up. For them its (mostly) just another way to receive donations, but for content-creators (and alike). People who´s income doesnt necessarily come from donations. Some get their money from advertisement, some from donations over paypal etc. from their fans.
To these people its a bigger game changer than for charities.
For charities its a pretty big deal too. They are very focused on cutting the fees on their donations short (having worked for UNICEF DK, i can confirm), but content creators still have a bigger "voice" in my humble opinion

ok, i get it now. ty. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:15:52
Instead of tipping people like Oprah, who already has more than enough dough, maybe its better to give out donations to "lesser" celebrities; Independent bands, "the podcast folks", etc.

Socrates — 'The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.'

@_date: 2014-11-16 13:56:50
I can recommend Force Strategy Gaming on youtube. Ive tried donating 5 bucks but he havent collected yet (probably got buried in comments).
The reason im recommending is that he does alot of "investigating" on his own (mostly about gaming ofc) and if he notices it, he will probably get it and maybe even do a video about (only if he likes it ofc).
Been following the channel for awhile so im very confident in his character atleast.
Edit: Also he gets citaded by way bigger gaming magazines sometimes, so larger players in the industri might get some decent exposure (not sure if that matters)

When Felix talked about his wife; he was serious or just imitating straight people?
@_date: 2014-11-08 16:44:38
totally agree.  I would imagine tipping content creators, like youtubers, independent bands, podcasters and people who write very good and original comments is the way to show the best face of changetip and microtransactions. 
to tip content that shows the creator actually put in some time and thought in creating it.
edit: and ofc tip amounts by which the recipient will appreciate.

You guys already know how to handle it :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 13:44:28
ye, use your tipping on people who actually appreciate it. Not the writer of TV-shows who already earns enough that a 2$ donation isnt even worth collecting.   Ofc, it would be cool to see mainstream references, but it is propably easier to get smaller outlets to be interested..
I dunno for sure, just my thoughts :)

@_date: 2014-11-10 14:55:55
I think the best way to spread Bitcoin-tipping-culture adoption is to reward content creators, who both have a voice (with subscribers on youtube, followers on twitter, etc.) and also appreciate the actual tip. 
Personal example: I used to follow a youtube-podcast called Shoddycast, and i actually donated 15$ via paypal because they created their content out of love for the topic (Elder Scrolls) and they really appreciated it (two brothers in 1 apartment, spending alot of time creating lore-videos for free).
If this sort of people realized theres another way to receive small donations from their fans, they would no doubt advocate it.
edit: spelling of Shoddycast
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:33:56
i got tipped about half a dollar... gave 5$ to Force Strategy Gaming on Youtube... havent collected yet
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:04:51
Does bitcoin face a crossroad? From what i understand the blocksize increase is not nearly urgent.  So isnt the debate happening now a preemptive move?

Hmmm.. I havent seen that before. I hope im not wrong, but the scope of the graph seems to be based on potentiel users.  What im thinking is that bitcoin has more than 1 set of potentiel users.  What I mean is; on earth there are 7 billion potentiel users, but there only 2-3 billion immediately potentiel users because the rest dont have access to internet.  Would it be possible to apply the same logic to level of understandig/exposure.  When I first heard about bitcoin, I wouldnt consider myself a potentiel user yet.  maybe its a stupid question?

@_date: 2016-03-21 22:24:59
What? You are making a comparison to other currencies without acknowledging the VERY different histories they and bitcoin have. They have a different starting point. Bitcoin is different because its an open system with finite supply. If it loses that, it loses what attractive and its value. 
And to the second half. Ye, more and growing number of nodes is good. Doesnt really apply as a response....

I love wondering about this in a future where bitcoin has become mainstream; lets say, theres 1 billion bitcoin users and the price is something like 100,000.  1 person/organization is going to have ALOT of dough..

I completely disagree. I and many others would sell immidiately if that happened. It is directly against their incentives. If entitites known to the general public as "miners" are able to create more coins out of nothing, nobody is ever going to buy or even be interested in Bitcoin as a whole.
@_date: 2016-03-29 21:59:56

"USD exchange rate (price)"... Ty bro! Learned sumthing new today :)
So youre saying, if we dont scale bitcoin on-chain, were all going to die?
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:32:31
So big miners makes the blocks bigger to push out the small miners. Why is bigger blocks a good thing for big miners? Bandwidth is the problem right? Dont big and small miners have access to the same internet? 
If what you describe were to become a problem IRL, how could it happen?
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:19:06
I cant help to think that this is a very isolated perspective on blocksize. I dont disagree, but the miners arent really interested in centralization and collusion. Sure, to some extent they are, but if it became a general problem that small miners couldnt compete, people would lose confidence in bitcoin and the value would decrease, which would not be in the miners´ interest. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 17:17:55
Is it not already a reality?
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:48:28
To me, The "Miners would, if unchecked, alter the subsidy schedule (effectively destroying bitcoin)" is ridiculous. I have seen it a couple of times and to me it seems very disingenuous. The incentive of any miner expect those specifically trying to attack bitcoin is monetary. Doing anything that even suggest that anybody might be able to create any more than 21 mil BTC or any other Rule of Bitcoin, would shake the confidence in bitcoin and many, like myself, would sell and look towards an Alt. Not to even mention if any of the Rules were broken. Bitcoins whole monetary value is based upon this confidence. Only a malicious miner would have the incentive to do so.

We simply arent ready for mass adoption. We need massively functionally ready 2nd layer solutions first.  
If such a product as u described existed, the fees would very quickly rise making btc unfit for microtransactions. 
We simply arent technologically ready yet.  And thats fine as long as other cryptos dont get there first.

Who knows? Maybe im completely detached from reality but almost everyone i have heard express their opinion about drugs dont think all of them should be legal.  Some think it should be decriminalized so people can get better help, but im "pretty sure" noone i have ever met thinks heroin should be completely legalized. They didnt need to directly vote on that. 
A lot of people i know think weed should be legal, so there is some nuances involved.   And i completely agee that it would be a good think to have a big public discussion about drug laws but it is not a black and white question and youre framing to be one.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:10:27
Blaming a incompetent man of malice is not nice either.  Thats why you have to correctly identify which is what.  Thats why i expressed my view, to way in.
What i meant by saying public opinion is against it is: Normal people doesnt view alcohol as a drug.  They view any illegal drugs as "drugs".  Pretty sure most people would say no if presented with the question: Do you think drugs should be legal?
Not that i agrees with most countries drugs laws.
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:53:26
This makes a lot of sense, but when i look at how things work most places, It seems more likely things are fucked up due to imcompetence, people being selfish and shortsighted etc.
Also, you cant expect poiliticans to legalize drugs when public opinion is against it.

Its pretty decent. played maybe 30 min, so take my opinion with a gram of salt. Should have a tutorial though... Gameplay could be  smoother. Also, aavailable buttons to push should not be grey!! make them green or blue or soumthin. Its universal for games. CANT PUSH GREY YET.  
I could see this becoming a very decent mobile game, but it needs some diversity i terms of what your "cards" can do. Give them some special abilities. Some throw balls that explodes, freezes, gives an extra attack if it hits 3 or more enemies etc. 
Maybe i just havent earned those cards yet, but then they should really have a tutorial that shows those mechanics. Its not very interesting just gathering cards to improve ur stats if u cant make a personal strategy.
  
I also didnt see any multiplayer but didnt really look for it either... If they dont have it, that is a giant fail!!
Nevertheless, I love everything that includes bitcoin in gaming and it would be SOOOOO cool if u could connect a specific (gamerwallet), so gametokens earned in one game could be used in another. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:39:01
Just awesome! Think i said this before but in my opinion, gaming and bitcoin is the perfect match. Paying for a entirely digital product for entirely digital currency makes a lot of sense to me.

Those endless wars were not wars with endless battles.  Most wars before the first world war were defined by battles lasting at most 1-2 days.  Its only in modern wars where battles have lasted for months.  It takes a lot more to supply long lasting battles in long wars than it does to supply long wars where most of the time at war is spent moving from A to B.

Ye sure! It is mostly explanatory and in a very positive light. The show begins by explaining that most of our national currency is already digitized. It touches on smart contracts.  It says bad things about Western Union and traditional remittance services.  It explains how it is not a scam or ponzi scheme. DR is our national TV channel and the absolute biggest and most well respected.  
It wasnt a hype-show. It was a show meant to explain what bitcoin is, how it works and what potential it holds.  In the sense of danish culture, it is framed very positive.  Not with "this is the future" rethoric, which does not really convince people here, but it explains how it is has the potential to be better than traditional banking.
Edit: It also featured a spokesperson from our biggest bank and he said "We are very interested in the technology but not so sure about the currency right now". He then went on to say that they might consider doing bitcoin (currency) services in the future, but right now they want to eliminate the middlemen between banks with the technology. (im paraphrasing).

Maybe i can get this right:  With the current 1MB blocksize its 7tx a second, and the proposed increase from "Gavin the Bitcoin-king" (hah) is getting it up to 20MB with a dobling every 2 years for 10 years (5 doblings). 
7*20=140.   140+140=280.   280+280=560.   560+560=1120.   1120+1120= 2240.   2240+2240= 4480.   4480tx each second after ten years.
Theres 3600 seconds each hour and 24 hours a day.   
4480 * 3600 * 24= 387.072.000.
387 million transactions a day.  Hope i got it right :)

I think a lot of the other comments have some great answers, but in addition, i think many merchants already feel progressive enough by just accepting it.  Some of what drives discounts is competition, and until merchants start competing with eachother for the bitcoin-demographic, you wont see much discount for using bitcoin.
Also: Some merchants (mainly not based in western societies, i would think) deal with way different fees than 2-5%.   I was in Uruguay and had a talk with the owner of a local hostel.  It was a small hippie/surfer town, and his hostel were the only to take credit-cards.  He had to pay 13% in fees, which is the reason nobody else took creditcard payments.  Im not sure how many worldwide have fees in the &gt;10% but those people would start making discounts that matter.
On a speculative sidenote: If there ever comes a time where bitcoin is generally perceived to increase in value over time, the discount would probably become very signifigant.  If there ever comes such a time, who knows?
Edit: Forgot a point
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:06:47
I think the main point in favor of Coinbase in the bitcoin space, compared to the fiat space, is that you have greater choice.  You dont need to use their service.  You can choose to use their service, or you can choose to control your private keys yourself.  Each choice comes with a risk; controlling my own keys: i might lose my bitcoin because im to dumb to secure it correctly, etc.  Coinbase controlling: they might steal, censure, be the next mt Gox, etc.

The way i see it,  A good move would be to involve independent content-creators.  Anybody who gets their income by donations, commercials from views ect.  These are the people who can benefit most and who also have a voice where they can reach alot of people.  
Certain youtube-channels (for example) have no problem asking for likes and subscribes.  Would it really be much more difficult to add a address and ask for donations in addition. 
Im not really sure how to get it started, but a proactive approach of educating could be a starting off point.
