In general there wasnt a lot of contracts purchased, so i think tomorrow will be a non-event.
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:00:09
The 20% is "circuit breaker" on the price swings per day; if tomorrow the price drops by more than 20% then they cease the trading of the bitcoin contracts. But yes you would want the price to move the in the direction of your contract without tripping the breaker.  However, based on the number of contracts out there, you can see the max profit the entire futures market can make tomorrow, and how much it will cost to move the price - the cost justification just doesn't exist.

They need justification and profit to motivate them - don’t disagree there are trading bots but they’re unrelated to the futures - anyone selling off btc to gain profit in their futures investment will only lose money

Theres a lot to unpack here, and I would equate his statements to the calling the internet just a book on a screen... "so you can put words and pictures on a server and access it anywhere.. big deal, internet is just a buzzword"
I dont think he fully understands the blockchain technology; I'd be curious to see his difficulty adjustment code, and hashing algorithm justification since its so easy..
He doesn't trust bitcoin because of blockchain, but suggests Litecoin is a long term play (a coin based on the same technology...) - he lacks understanding, and as u/biologischeavocado states, he's suffering from the Dunning–Kruger effect by definition...

This is the first crash involving futures and direct Wall Street manipulation, which means it could go either way.. I can see a floor around $5000, and then we slowly build back to $10k over the year, but I have no more info than you, just opinions lol

The value is set by what someone is willing to pay. Mining adds some intrinsic value, but this is a fraction of the total $/btc - if the value drops below this fraction, it is then no longer profitable to mine... and they’ll stop mining
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:12:48
Impressive they’re doing a 91:1 split, but splits have no effect on price - companies do splits to attract more retail investors to make the security seem more approachable (think buying a share for $125 vs $11200, same difference in value and market cap)

Admittedly, I sold here. I agree, it could recover as it always does, but now we're into the price range where the newbies after Thanksgiving are officially losing money.. I think this will add acceleration to the sell off, imo

Fair - just saying there's no direct motivation for someone holding a contract to manipulate the price down - I cant speak to the self-fulfilling prophecy of the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:49:32
I’d like to believe the rest of the market is as rational and smart as you.. but I don’t think we’re that lucky.. everybody wanted their lambo when it hit $50k 
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:47:47
Then you just furthered my point... I was saying the $15M to manipulate the price was too steep to justify it.. you're saying its more than that, even more reason they wont manipulate tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:18:40
Yeah, OP is getting downvotes, but honestly I believe this is one of the largest driving factors in the price - it’s unregulated so Wall Street can manipulate and make loads without violating any laws... my guess is others will catch on as time passes and the effects will be less pronounced (you’ll get equally deep pockets fighting to keep it above $11k, for example)
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:29:03

It is an opinion - i also kind of think theres money on the sidelines waiting for the dip tomorrow, so if it does dip, they jump in, if it doesnt, i think it could run around 1115am EST tomorrow (after the contracts are out of play).

Give some justification for the price falling besides “it did last futures expiration thus it will again” - show me how they stand to make any money by tanking the price
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:05:04
There would certainly be a drop in demand... the general public doesnt want to deal in illegal activities, and institutions would drop all connection to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:33:42
Yeah but the way futures work, it’s based on the price of bitcoin at a specific time (contract expiration) - so you manipulate the price above/below where you need it right before the contract expires to increase your profit and spend the least to get it there

Wall Street has insane money, especially when they see an opportunity. Where did you get the $400M number? Market cap of bitcoin is $200B, was $400M the futures market cap for Jan 17 expiration?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:34:05
OP’s original comment said bitcoin generates profit for the miners which keeps it alive.. i was saying the mining doesn’t guarantee bitcoins longevity  
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:43:07
These contracts came out when bitcoin was flirting with $20k and people had bitcoin fever, it would not be hard to find long buyers, if you were shorting - so yes zero sum. My point is they are not motivated to incur the expense of price manipulation to further gain profit in their future contract.

@_date: 2018-01-04 18:57:39
One option works now but costs more $ today (bitcoin), one option works now but costs centralization (or power) today (bitcoin cash).  Of the two options, long-term, which is the lower risk; giving up power today or paying more today?  I tend to side with paying more today, and working to scale, rather than giving up power today, and hoping i can get that power back later...

You could use that same logic on learning anything though... they could learn on $50 and then get capital if they’re good to scale up to a “worthwhile $/hr”

@_date: 2018-01-14 04:47:52
I used them for a while and they were great, fees were 0.25% for limit orders though, and GDAX is 0... so I switched. Gemini defaults you to $100k daily bank transfers which is nice, but I’ve read there’s more bots on their exchange than others meaning you could place a limit order and bot will immediately jump in front of you, I never experienced this (just read about it).

You can’t always worry about the futures, sometimes you have to live in the now

1. The price of bitcoin should drop by about 5% to accommodate the extra 1M bitcoins added to the supply.
2. He could be granted a mining rig, and awarded the 1 bitcoin, or if it was created the same rules as above apply.
3.  Again, same logic as number 1
4. The genie would have to force the hand of Armstrong to implement Segwit, in which case the wish would be granted, but then Armstrong would be able to simply undo the implementation, and an error box would appear on each persons coinbase app stating “deposits and withdraws are suspended temporarily” while Armstrong jerked off to undoing the Segwit update, and cumming onto a Bcash trezor wallet with Vers face taped to it smiling back at him.

5% of bitcoin is traded in S Korea... price drops 12%... makes sense 
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:47:00
Yeah i certainly learned the "not more than you're willing to lose" lesson on the last major dip (Jan 17) lost 1/3 of my holdings (which extra sucks bc I'm paying tax on the whole amount, but now I have 1/3 less to afford last years taxes).  Hoping to rebuild on the next dip. Congrats on the boat!
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:12:17
By waiting, they are not manipulating the price down though... no dip tomorrow
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:51:45
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:13:04
Because when these contracts were issued bitcoin was flirting with $20k, and retail investors believed it would go to $50k (at the time).  Meanwhile, the financial investors sold the shorts, who also happen to have the additional capital to try to manipulate the market if they wanted.

Correct, you are only taxed on the profit - the video paints it much worse than it is.

Subjective is correct - your banking history is taken into consideration on whether you get a knock at the door... if you live on $10k/yr, and suddenly transfer $20k into your account = Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).  If you have a history of high balance transfers, its still reported on a Currency Transaction Report, but no SAR.

They're independent, but the futures contract value is tied to bitcoins price, so someone could be motivated to steer the price one way or another - but agree, in the grand scheme of things, i dont think it'll have any effect.

Key to investing; only invest in what YOU believe in, not what others tell you - if you believe in the underlying tech and the potential, buy some. Buying because others are getting rich is not an investing strategy (or a good one at least). 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:23:43
After much debate and research, I can answer this now (from a CME futures basis);
Any entity is limited to owning 1k contracts containing 5btc each. Every $5 move in bitcoin is a $25 profit/loss on a contract. In the recent month, we saw the price move from $19k to $10k at expiration - accounting for a $9k price move, meaning $45M possible profit per entity.
I tend believe multiple entities could collect and agree on a direction (for example 10 groups) meaning the profit would be $450M for last month. To manipulate the price, it costs about $15M to buy all the btc within $1k of the current price. The group of 10 entities could agree to spend $30M to move the price lower by $2k, and make $10M per group (or $70M profit from spending $30M). This is a theory, but how I believe the price could be effected by the futures.
As the market matures and becomes more balanced, these opportunities will be harder to accomplish, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable that this could have happened the first month of futures being available.

Theres a lot more to consider than just the futures though.  The futures announcement was one element in a storm of good news and optimism for bitcoin.  It happens to be the opposite now as they expire.

@_date: 2018-01-25 14:48:00
This. I think it’ll be the self-fulfilling prophecy; the second it starts to dip people will say “we were right, it’s falling” and some will sell driving it lower - probably a huge run up Fri night honestly 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:50:18
Closes at 11am - I expect it around $11k

They can only sell it for the market price. They have to sell it to all the buyers willing to pay market price and the prices just under that.. they can’t just sell it for $9k to their partner in crime to tank the price - and the tax loss is capped 
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:40:52
My analysis was more for tomorrow's contract expiration, than general price manipulation (i acknowledge price manipulation is real) - i dont think anyone is motivated to tank the price tomorrow.

@_date: 2018-01-19 13:06:13
This. Wall Street deals in $100Ms sometimes more - if I have a futures contract that expires stating bitcoin will be sub $11k that I opened in Dec when bitcoin was $18k, I stand to profit 100’s%... you can see directly on the depth chart of Coinbase how much it costs to buy every order within a price range (and typically it’s like $3M to move the price $500 in either direction). If my futures contract expires worthless at $11,001+ I’m gonna spend a couple $M to manipulate the price down... personally I believe that’s what happened Jan 17
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:38:04
My guess is from a financial perspective its hard to rationalize the market cap of bitcoin, and in the case of the Jan 17 expiration, many probably got in around $19k mark - lower risk for them to short when bitcoin was hitting an ATH at that time.  They also need a seller for all the short contracts they buy, and there was fever of "$50k/btc!" then that it was probably easy to sell the long contracts.  I think as time goes on, the ability to manipulate will drop (as more deep pockets take the opposite position).  
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:48:38
Yeah if this were 0 I’d probably still use them
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:09:59

I made a large purchase on Overstock in January of 2017.  The network was not as slow, and I honestly did not have the issues you had - I received an address to send coins to, paid my 3.5btc for my new couch, and once the network picked up my transaction, Overstock put the order as pending, until i received 3 confirmations (about 10mins).  I've often wondered what their return policy is however... would i get my 3.5btc back?  
It sure is a comfortable couch though...
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:22:15
Can the futures market cap exceed the market cap of btc? I assume yes, if everyone said bitcoin was going to $100k/btc and buying those contracts, it would be significantly more than $400M

The high fees and confirmation times are only going to gain traction, IMO - it’s going to be tough to get over the $20k wall. People bought in thinking they could use and now they’re getting burned on fees... I think this will pull the price back, i could see a pull back to $7500 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:31:54
There definitely was, but you had the well timed influx of the Thanksgiving fomo that pushed it passed, I don’t see any catalyst like that in the near future - if anything I’m worried the Christmas conversation at dinner will about buying $50 of bitcoin, and losing $40 of it to fees (scaring people from buying)
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:46:46
But today bitcoin is sold as the full package - store of wealth and use everyday for a small fee and instantly... recently the latter has been removed, and I think we’ll see the price reflect that over the coming days
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:05:28
If it’s new purpose is a store of value, then the price is going to change to reflect that new purpose - many are/were willing to pay $15.5k bc it was both; store of value and daily use (no fees and instant transfer)... it just lost half that. The price will change to reflect the new “store of value” utility as the speculation fades
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:20:10

Forks are when a new coin is introduced, and takes a specific snapshot in time (typically a block) so that any bitcoins you held when that block was mined (the snapshot) - you now have that many of the forked coin. Example; I had 10 bitcoin when block 478558 was mined on Aug 1, which is when the fork occurred for Bitcoin Cash. I now have 10 bitcoin and 10 bitcoin cash. The value of the forked coin is determined by the market - initially bitcoin cash was only trading at $300, and eventually it rose in value, but bitcoin cash is traded independent of bitcoin. All future forks will work the same way, and the value of the forked coin is based on the market (if people believe in the technology, etc)

It’s tough to swallow the new narrative of “store of value” given that it was founded to protect people from governments and banks.. the high fees is just another form of this. Oppressed people in Venezuela or Greece can’t live their lives off a bitcoin wallet anymore, sure they can hold their savings, but when you pay $51 for a $15.50 transaction... the tech is broken

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:49:32
But don’t you agree the price today reflects that utility promise - vast majority that bought in over the last 3 months did not do so to move their savings to a digital wallet for security.. the demand (and subsequent price increase) was driven by the promise of future money (and easy to to move funds) - that’s not the case and the price will likely reflect that realization as 90% of the bitcoin owners will not be able to use as intended... it’s like everyone buying an iPhone and then finding out the call feature doesn’t actually work.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:53:19
Yeah I suppose we’ll see - i suspect regardless the initial reaction when they offer it (either to sell or actually trade) will be a dip in the Bcash price 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:24:32
Ultimately it’s a guess - but yes the futures give bitcoin a new level of legitimacy and reopen the discussion for an ETF, which would be very bullish for the price of bitcoin - personally I think we get a little dip out of the futures going live this week, then a steady price climb in January (likely above $20k) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:23:44

Originally my thought was Wall Street will see the speculative bubble and short, but I don’t think we’re as close to the popping point yet. I keep reading about hedge funds investing in it, and how financial advisors will likely see bitcoin as a way to further diversify portfolios..

It’s tough to get people to switch from the first mover (like bitcoin) - I agree, unless you have something that improves on the the first, and the first mover ignores = Facebook giving social media a clean UI, exclusive by college email, etc 
Bitcoin has a number of possible improvements that could/should be implemented, and there are altcoins addressing this - once people stop adopting, and start actually using, these issues will be magnified.. I’m personally concerned for it, as a bitcoin holder, it lowers the utility of bitcoin compared to the alternatives

Bcash is marketed as the scaling solution with lower fees, and by forking had the same number of users as bitcoin - I personally liquidated my bcash for more bitcoin in Oct, but I’m starting to see the issues raised - I agree no way Ethereum is the end all coin, it has its purpose for smart contracts, not scalability. Crypto is an entire industry, and it’s early days - just like any new industry, the first mover is rarely the one that lasts.. it’s anyone’s guess, and for the sake of my own small fortune, I hope you’re right.

I’m not disagreeing, I just don’t think general populous that has run bitcoins price up to $20k from $5k is not going to be patient enough to wait for LN and probably doesn’t really care if their coin is semi-decentralized or truly-decentralized - I would expect people to slowly dump their positions for coins with more utility

Bitcoins ecosystem is so efficient that you can quantify every ounce of energy it takes to use... this is not true of traditional banking.

You think a $100B asset is going to hurt the $25T US economy (which is 1/3 of the world economy)?  Again people will still use it, but the entire concept is based on walking into starbucks and paying in bitcoin - a lot of the price has that idea factored in.. the intrinsic value is the ease and cost of transfer of money, and there are other alt coins that accomplish that..

The price speculation is based on mass adoption. If the US govt said bitcoin was illegal tomorrow, yes some would still have some or trade it, but no business is going to accept illegal currency, and the majority won’t risk owning an “illegal asset” - without positive future outlook, the price will drop

@_date: 2017-11-01 16:36:54
This is a loaded statement; yes it would rise if “everyone” decided not to sell in the sense that demand would exceed supply, but at some point, a person would say “I’d rather have $8k than 1 btc” and they would sell. Question becomes at what point do enough people say that where the price begins to drop and not rise

Why wait to refine your programming skills and open a new business until after you "make a profit" in cryptos - do this stuff now... you can do that stuff at night. If you have a good business idea; build a business plan and pitch it to your friends who are "connected" with cushy jobs, if they're not interested, ask if their coworkers are.  Find people to help you get the business started.
Bitcoin is great, but its not a good strategy to put in money you feel emotionally tied to... because you will make dumb choices on when to sell (and you can get really depressed when its down... coming from someone who HODL'd through the 2013 crash, bitcoin was very depressing for a couple years).  Be smart about how you change your life, have a plan that doesn't involve gambling with your life savings.

As someone who bought a sectional from Overstock for 3.5 bitcoins this past spring, i don’t want to spend any anymore bc now my couch is worth more than my car... but it is a comfortable sectional 
My first purchase with it and I feel burned, making me hodl now going forward - volatility has gotta drop before people will spend it

But couldn’t they still borrow equity on the debt owed to them from the first bitcoin loan, and then issue a second loan all based on the original loan (like they do today in banking)

It objective, has to be considered a romantic relationship - same thing for restraining orders

There’s an element of this that feels “Ponzi” because the whole culture is just buy and hold, which inherently raises the price. I own some myself, but I keep reading about kids (20-30 yr olds) paying off their mortgage from their gains in bitcoin, and you can’t just create that kind of value (what’s the market cap $88B now?). Someone has to pay, and like the dotcom bubble, it’ll be whoever is holding when the price starts to tank.  The difference here, anyone can buy around the world, so the price could get insanely high for a “global Ponzi scheme”. 
No question blockchain technology is a true innovation, but the price of bitcoin has to correct at some point.. it will fall, and then level off (IMO).

I’m not questioning they bought low and could sell high today, I’m questioning that level of value creation - has the world gained $88B in useful value from bitcoin?

I think the speculation will outweigh the utility (at some point) - and there will be a lot of people buying at the top before it corrects to a less volatile level

I’d say adoption and use - I couldn’t buy furniture at Overstock when the price was $500, and couldn’t pay any friends (who had never heard of it) - now its mainstream, the outlets that accept are far greater

I was wondering about this - if an organization decided to created collateralized debt obligation product of bitcoin debt, it should all be traceable on the blockchain and you could audit that each member was making payments (ie preventing The Big Short 2 movie)

I’d say a good mix of pyramid and Ponzi - it just broke through Madoff’s $50B record too...

Exactly, I think this is on a global scale too, so the top is much higher and the barrier to entry is much lower - it’s like Bernie had a website where people could throw any extra $20 they had into his fund

People and business will always need to borrow - a smart business has some portion of debt against their assets to grow faster
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:49:01
What value do you place on that? $100B, $T? Where does the price level off, because it’s not infinite
