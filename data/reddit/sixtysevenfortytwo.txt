volume is very low. it's like a trickle from the faucet. look at the past two weeks. it's all been very low volume. market doesn't know whether btc will rise or fall. 
expect it to either (1) rocket upwards, or (2) rocket downwards. if the price drops very far, then either (1) we see consistent decreases down to 1/4 of current price (e.g. gox) because the market thinks the price is too high, or (2) the market responds with a massive buying spree, as they perceive the price to be low. 
fwiw, gox is the only time in the history of btc that the price failed to rebound quickly after these kind of market conditions. of course, btc eventually rebounded from gox, but there was a two year winter that nobody wants.

You mean the block reward that is a small, planned, transparent increase in supply that incentivizes verification of transactions on the network? That is kind of how blockchains work. It would be concerning if new bitcoins weren't being made lol.

True but I don't think I can time the market all that well. It seems tough for anyone to predict what will happen next

Volume is an indicator of the amount of transactions that take place over a period of time. Typically, the highest volume happens when the price falls rapidly, as people panic sell. Low volume indicates uncertainty with the current price. Medium volume typically correlates with gains.

I think a lot of people never sell. I dont. I only hold and buy more

Yea I guess. But I would only ever play with like .1 of my BTC, and the short term profits off a dip in price wouldn't justify the time, effort, or risk imo

Transaction delay is ridiculous right now. Segwit and LN should be top priority for all of the major players involved in crypto. I understand that some parties are making a killing off of fees from the backlog of unconfirmed transactions, but this is necessarily detrimental to the BTC ecosystem and will not last forever. BTC loses much of it's utility over fiat if transactions take 12+ hours to complete. It is nearly as slow as a traditional wire transfer.

Yea the nitty gritty details are very complicated. I don't think OP should go into that level of depth in a 500 word summary. If you explained a bank account to someone, you wouldn't go into details about how deposits, withdrawals, and payments are tracked by the bank. You would explain it using everyday words that describe how it functions for the consumer, i.e. how the consumer uses the product. I think OP should do that for his Bitcoin report.

This is too technical. Use familiar words and vernacular English. It seems like you copied a lot of this from the Wikipedia page. After reading this, I think you should pick a different topic for your report. It is very hard to understand.
Bitcoin is simple. It's money. People are familiar with digital money. They use credit cards all the time. Bitcoin will probably evolve to the point where it has its own swipeable card at some point, if it takes off.
Just explain it on those terms and you will be fine. BTC is still in it's infancy. The long cryptographic wallet IDs are complicated and easy to mess up. It will get easier with time.

No problem good luck. Just dumb it down a bit.
