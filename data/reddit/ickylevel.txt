No, they will trade the futures.

Coinbase has pegged Bcash To Bitcoin, that's why it keeps crashing . How stupid .

GDAX has been pegging the price of Bcash  to Bitcoin. Now Bcash follows every Bitcoin move.
Is it this what's causing the crash ?

Roger Ver should go to Jail!
He fore sure likes to sell explosives.

Too conservative. We are looking at an exponential growth.

US dollar?

Bitcoin cash is centralised. It's an attack on the whole crypto market.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:33
At least it is decentralised. BCH is not a cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:20:37


You just bought BCH at 9000?

How can we still have 35% corrections when the market cap is 300bn? You can't compare a swing in price when it's 19k to when is 1k.

The BCH/ BTC chart is the weirdest thing I have ever seen in crypto. Doesn't look like a chart.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:06:18
That's really suspicious! The big banks are preparing to short it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:32:53
They artificially pegged it to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:41
They flood the network with fake transactions, and the chinese miners pull out of BTC right after a difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:44:45
35% actually.

Is that viral marketing for Zcash?
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:43:12
Yes.
