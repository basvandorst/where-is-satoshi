Size, I think.  Presumably if WoW gold or Linden dollars had a volume and market value large enough, they'd attract the interest of money launderers and government enforcement too.  And in the U.S. at least, cash transactions under $10,000 don't have to be reported; larger ones do.  I doubt there's enough trade in WoW gold or Linden dollars to draw government attention.

I'm not saying they can shut down the network itself.  That much is clear.  But you don't need to shutdown the network to destroy most of the value of bitcoins to ordinary people.  Unlike bittorrent and Gnutella, bitcoin relies on more than the transfer of mere data - you have to be able to transfer money into and out of the system for the coins to have any value. (at least, until there are significantly more ways to spend BTC directly without conversion to other currencies.)
Anti-money laundering legislation would be the primary way to attack the exchanges.  Transferring money from banks to bitcoin exchanges could be outlawed relatively easily, which means all exchanges of ordinary money for bitcoins would be relatively small amounts traded in person.  This would lower the demand (and price) for BTC.
For that matter, AML legislation is likely a reason there's only one primary exchange at the moment.  Increased regulation isn't the kind of thing that makes the creation of additional exchanges particularly attractive.

What if the government embraces cryptocurrency while cracking down on bitcoin itself?  Suppose the they create their own competing protocol, with coins premined to an amount equivalent to the current money supply.  They make their cryptocurrency exchangeable at a fixed rate with the current fiat, and simultaneously crack down on bitcoin itself.  The government maintains control over the money supply, while the public gains an electronic means of transferring currency.  Plus, since government fiat is likely to demonstrate less volatility than bitcoins in the near term,  the public might be more willing to store their funds in it.  And there's no reason the government couldn't make the protocol less anonymous than bitcoin as well.  What's to stop this from happening?

Did you ask what the guy who doubled the pot thinks?  I'm sure some of us wouldn't mind part of the balance :P but half of that was donated for a puzzle contest.

Stuck after the second step.  And the part after the semicolon is the right length for an address, but it's all upper-case...

This is neat, but the binary index in this method will scale with the length of the data encoded, I think.  If the instructions to "decode" the data are on average as large, or larger than the data itself, you don't really have a data storage mechanism, but a very odd form of data transmission.  The blockchain at least provides a means of storing arbitrary data with a fixed size set of instructions to retrieve it.

there are five "A"s too, so it's 50! / (4! * 5! * 2^9 ) = 2.06e+58
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:21:23
Right, that's my point.  And since most people are probably more concerned about volatility and ease of exchange for goods than anonymity, increased government tracking wouldn't likely be a huge impediment to adoption.  Especially if bitcoin is presented to the public as an illegal currency for tax evasion and drug purchases.

It's possible if you have a system of trusted addresses to get around the confirmation delays.  See [green addresses.](   If you pay from a trusted address (possibly via an online wallet or other service provider with a trustworthy reputation to uphold), the machine can accept the transaction knowing that the reputation of the sending address relies on not attempting a double spend.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars in startup funding is nothing compared to government backing and the power of law enforcement.  I think you're right that government is likely too bureaucratic and slow to create an effective response - at least in the near term, but if they really wanted to crush bitcoin, I don't see anything in your response that says it isn't actually possible.
You've ignored my points about the advantages of government:  they can set a fixed exchange rate between their own electronic currency and fiat, and simultaneously attack the exchanges to devalue bitcoin.  I think this would be enough to drive most people away from bitcoin.  I'm not trying to be overly critical here - I think bitcoin has a great deal of potential, but it's useful to soberly consider the possibilities.  Consider it playing devil's advocate to counter some of the more rosy techno-utopianism I see here.  Open source is hardly magic, and government cryptocurrency need not be open anyway.  It just has to be more convenient for normal people.

Huh.  I had no idea the Second Life economy was so large.  I read a bit, and it sounds like it's pretty hard to get large amounts in and out, but it may simply be that law enforcement hasn't caught up yet, or considers it a low priority.  Bureaucracies aren't known for their speed, which definitely a point in bitcoin's favor.
Otoh, [bitcoin had the attention of the FBI over a year ago.] (  Someone in the government is definitely thinking about these things.
I guess there's a question of whether law enforcement would take the form of an outright ban or go with restrictive transparency requirements.  Afaik, with WoW and Linden dollars, reporting and deanonymizing large transactions wouldn't be difficult.  But bitcoin would be much harder to regulate, since tying any particular address to a person is intentionally difficult.  No reason they can't say that virtual currencies are OK as long as ownership is transparent - a requirement that bitcoin doesn't readily satisfy.

This seems like a non-issue to me.  The blockchain is a terrible place to store "evil data" compared to something like Freenet. Storing that data in the block chain has an actual cost in transaction fees, and I doubt Bitcoin will see much of this outside of proofs of concept and things like the AACS decryption key.  There are better ways to disseminate illegal data; if there's a crackdown on Bitcoin for bad stuff in the blockchain it'll only be after the government has gone after Freenet, Tor, et al, first.
And if they want to kill Bitcoin outright, I imagine the potential for money laundering and illegal purchases would be the first reason it would come under attack.

As I understand it, the capability is in the protocol, but the bitcoin clients don't have escrow transactions implemented yet.  Basically, all transactions are implemented as scripts in a special functional programming language.  Escrow transactions simply require a more complicated script than a standard transaction.

Really? I hear that Chrome's math.random only has a 32 bit seed, so that's only ~4 billion possible permutations, assuming that's the routine used.

They can't loan out more than they have in reserves, but they can loan out some fraction of reserves.  Deposit guarantees plus money loaned out can exceed the amount in reserves, and as long as everyone doesn't ask for their deposits at the same time this increases the money supply.  If there's a run on the bank however, it might not have enough reserves to cover the guarantee; then the bank would fail and some people might lose their holdings. (unlike current banks where the central bank can guarantee deposits as the lender of last resort by printing money.)
Fortunately, the public block chain would make it much easier to verify the level of reserves of a bank dealing in bitcoin.
