I fucking love chess. I spend hours a day playing that shit, read books about it, follow the some of the bigger tournaments, etc.
I can tell you that almost no-one but semi-delusional chess lovers will call Chess a sport. Yes, some degree of fitness does help at top level play but there is absolutely no strenuous physical activity going on. The myth about these things qualifying as sports likely came about from the (necessary) granting of an 'Athletes Pass' to pro players.

Okay. This is different:


In terms of Competitive Handwriting the emphasis is on the physical side of things, rather than the mental/intellectual side as is the case with gaming and chess.

Playing something competitively and for a living and being really good at it does not make it a sport.

Writing is a physical activity, painting is a physical activity, those are not sports.
Doing literally anything requires that you have some degree of movement, that doesn't make everything a sport. The emphasis is not on the physical side of things.

A competition in which the emphasis is on physical activity. Not chess, not E-Sports (although I really have no problem with them being called that.)
And what are you, trying to take the moral high ground? I've watched dozens of Carlsen's and Kasparov's games and I fucking loved them, follow both of them in their tournaments and such. Calling Chess a hobby or a game does not show any kind of disregard for their brilliance, just like calling League of Legends a game doesn't imply that Froggen or Doublelift aren't brilliant at what they do.
If you think it's insulting then the fault is with your associations with the words, not the words themselves - which despite being logically and calmly argued for by TupacShakur1996 [lel], you're telling people to fuck off and acting as if they're ignorant for stating an opinion and backing it up with evidence.
