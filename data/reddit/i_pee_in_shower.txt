Sorry u/pkop, I read the speculative attack article and I didn't like it. It takes statements that are not axioms and treats them as such, and them builds in these false axioms to establish what I would characterize as a false truth. I am not Kurt Goedel so I'm not going to sit here and tear the article a new arsehole. Suffice it to say I am not buying what the author is selling. There are a lot of good points but I especially resent the view that Bitcoin has already been established as the superior currency and fiat is dead. I feel this is more mythos than reality.
That's like saying "altavista is clearly the best search engine" until Google made it obsolete. I'm sure
Someone out there made that mistake.
Here is what I know. There is more money in leveraged derivatives than in the GNP of most countries. Individuals have higher networth than the entire market cap of bitcoin. I wonder how extensive are Bill Gates, Warren Buffet snd Carlos Slim's holdings? Well odds are that the top 10 richest individuals don't even hold 10% of all Bitcoins? I wonder why?
If the article is truth the everyone not converting fiat into Bitcoin will come to regret it... this of course is nonsense.
This is a revolution but make no mistake, in 10 years it will have taken a different shape. What we are experiencing right now is a gold rush, plain and simple. Smart money is to take advantage of it snd HoDl until you can't afford to and them unload. I will eat a sock if in 10 years 1 BTC is worth $100,000 USD (especially since I have no intention of HODLing that long)

Because the U.S. dollar is the official currency of the largest economy and market in the world. I'm not being pro 'Murica here, the same would apply to China in the future.
We also use U.S dollars because they are accepted everywhere and all the services I expect to use are mapped to it. And no, it doesn't automatically lose value. Just as there is inflation there is also deflation.
Bitcoin and friends will eventually be mapped to every major service but it will be a long way off when you go to a poor farmer anywhere and he accepts Bitcoin as his preferred method of payment.
"Listen Luis it's super simple; just create a wallet and make sure you keep the key safe at all times, if you don't, you lose everything. Then make sure you pay outrageous service fees including network fees just to move it from point a to b. Finally it will change value while you sleep but don't worry about that, just spend it liberally"
It's just not there yet. I'm for Cryptos but this talk of "we won! Take that Fed!" Is nonsense.

So I'm tier 2. It says I can deposit fiat $2000USD when I try to do so it says I have to be at tier 3. This is misleading to me. It's it clear that unless you get tier 3 verified, i cannot actually send a single USD. I'm not going to send utility bills. Do I send my money back to coinbase?

@_date: 2017-08-07 03:44:31
I think someone needs to make derivatives off cryptocurrencies so you buy and sell options.
I think most likely Bitcoin will lose most of its value in a very short amount of time, due to unforseen cataclysmic bad news (legislation, government sponsored coin, etc) and I think thinking it will completely replace Fiat is a pipe dream.
I love the idea of it, but the real value is the blockchain and its applications. Its legacy the services and industries creates. But like the dotcom bubble this too shall pop and something better will replace it. I think it is the most exciting and important invention in years but that most people will HODL their way too far and too long. 
Hard to really predict the future so we will see.

Does anyone here honestly feel that any government would cede control of the value of their money voluntarily? 
I can see the Federal Reserve Bank slowly releasing a coin that is not Bitcoin with the full backing of the U.S. and allies. I can see that coin having a market cap of trillions and making Bitcoin seem like Satoshi's in comparison. This would burst the current Bitcoin bubble and solidify its legacy as the real future of currency, something who's value doesn't wildly fluctuate like a precious commodity in high demand.
Make no mistake gentlemen, the current success of Bitcoin is due to a combination of rarity and speculative value. Not due to its success as a trading platform; much less an actual coin. In fact, it behaves like a gold coin in that one would be a fool to use it to buy milk or eggs with. Gold is legitimate too but it's not going to used as the world's currency. Neither will Bitcoin in the current form. 
Ultimately the idea of a digital coin is too good to not iterate to perfection, and anyone that thinks it's already perfect is a fundamentalist. I'm personally tired of people treating Bitcoin with religious zealotry.

Nonsense. Those altcoin people's as you call them are raising awareness of this discovery and making it viral. Are most of their efforts doomed to fail? Of course. That doesn't mean alt-coins are bad. For a market instrument to work, it should follow the basic principles of one. Competition is good. The fact that the market is diversified AND Bitcoin keeps growing proves that money is leaving traditional instruments like equities and moving here. For all we know the money that moved out of NVDA is in Bitcoin today. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:14:01
Wow, this entire thread is great. A few points I want to comment on.
1) it is highly unlikely that Bitcoin will be ever adopted as the official world currency. It's far more likely there will be many changes to the panorama and that BTC will continue to evolve and be used as a way to compare all other coins. The fact is that with its current fluctuation in value people are not treating it as a currency to spend. Why would this change? Even if it was accepted everywhere you would be a fool to spend it today. In order to stabilize the price, It would need to be controlled, specifically the majority of the currency would need to held by stakeholders unwilling to trade it. The price of a coin under this theoretical scenario would be exorbitant and thus people would not part.
On the other hand, if there are no central actors involve and we just let market actors lead the way, the bankers and investors will eventually dominate the market by using quantitative methods and deep learning algorithms. It will behave like a stock with price swings. The rich get richer here as well which leads me to...
2) A lot of people see Bitcoin as an economic equalizer. Like poorer countries or poorer citizens will somehow become more competitive because of adoption. There is no point of balance in a global economy and not everyone can be rich. I'm not saying people deserve to be poor but there is an inherent transfer of wealth, from poor to rich, akin to entropy. Maybe not as undeniable as thermodynamics but it has been the way of man since te beginning. My point is that with cryptos the rich will continue to get richer because they will be in the best position to exploit it. Don't believe me? How many people can afford 10 bitcoins now vs 5 years ago? How many will be able to afford 1 coin in 5 years?
3) let's say all governments decide that cryptos are bad and they collectively ban it (impossible but a thought experiment.) the market would shrink and the onus would on security and anonymity features. It would go underground but would thrive.
On the other hand, what if the US adopts it, not to replace the Dollar, but to complement it? I know a lot of people don't want FreedomCoin but it would guarantee that 50 years from now everyone would only use cryptocurrencies.
My main point is that rather than pretending that cryptos are a social movement that will empower the poor and raise them into parity we should instead be focused on its technical advantages and improving its usability. I have news from the future! Banks still exist. And so does a US currency. In the future it will be probably still be centralized but it will probably be digital in nature. Can you not have a cryptocoin that is managed by the Fed but still has all the advantages of using blockchain?
For people that want no part in an American currency I understand that completely. I don't want to use a currency that is controlled by the PRC. Maybe all nations need to keep their own currency and just transform it into a digital version. 
Improve security and transaction time, get rid of 3rd party fees but still maintain a stable value. &lt;/novel&gt;

Your response is not accurate. Fluctuations in price are not caused by growth. 
Bitcoin cannot replace the USD even it it becomes "universally accepted". It will at best be an alternate form of payment, like Paypal. As long as the price is controlled by the market and not consensus it's going to be subject to manipulation and thus too unstable to use as a primary currency.

Dear u/forthosethings, when you give cryptic warnings it's polite to explain your reasoning. Coinbase seems solid today, and they have a long term BTC vault. Anywhere that there is a large concentration of wealth is going to be a target. That includes your house. Problem is at home there are a million other factors that can affect your stash. A child could accidentally format a usb drive thinking the contents are gibberish, a future ex-wife could take it as collateral, a thief could steal an entire safe thinking there was cash and angrily throw away your cryptostash. We use banks and we trust them to safe keep our belongings. Maybe the real solution is to start setting insurance to exchanges?

The whole movement beyond bitcoin sounds like a clever scheme. Even BTC is so suspicious in its origins that most people should keep their savings clear. 
The real problem right now is the distinction between it being a currency and an investment vehicle.
How many people here get paid in BTC? Is there an asshole in this planet that has the balls to demand payment in ETH or some other coin exclusively?
No? Then Today BTC is a volatile investment vehicle, everything else is a derivative and we are mostly speculators. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:08:05
One thought and one question I would like mature responses to.
1) I think in order for any coin to work it must be spent in commerce, otherwise it's a commodity and not a currency. People saying "I'm HODLing ftw" might be acting for their individual best interest, but ultimately against the currency's, thus being participant to a point in such currency's apparent lack of legitimacy to some.
Some people point to the 10,000 BTC for one pizza as an example of both BTC growth and a cautionary tale of spending it early. I feel this is misguided. You have to establish a baseline for it to be a currency or accept it as a cryptographic online gambling game.
2) I invest in equities and I want to speculate in BTC for profit (like a lot of people) but I find the vehicles to be somewhat primitive compares to stocks and options. What would you guys think to be a sound approach to BTC accumulation? Let's say I have 10,000 USD. I'll suggest an approach.
I) establish a baseline price, like a 10 day moving average.
II) buy 10% of BTC (0.1) every time there is a 10% drop from that baseline
III) lower baseline by 5% 
IV) if price is breached goto II)
V) if price &gt; than 10% of original baseline sell otherwise wait.
This is obviously not a foolproof algorithm and considering exchange and network fees I'm not sure the percentage is large enough to profit but I wanted to offer something since I asked.

People that use Gifs to convey points are not exactly deep thinkers.
I have some coins from 100 years ago that I cannot spend. They have lost their value and worth. That was fiat money. Let's try to go to Walmart and buy captain crunch with some commodities. Oh they don't take precious silk?
What about electronic currency that doesn't hold
It's value and fluctuates over time bases on news, speculation, daily amount of trades, etc. that sounds like an equity in disguise.
I cannot buy some Goddamn Captain Crunch with my Apple stock either!
Currency has to hold value, be universally accepted as a form of payment and be exchanged for goods and services (successfully)  in their order to work as "money", otherwise it's just another gimmicky investment vehicle like a Credit Default Swap and our kids will be making fun of us when they watch "the Big HODL" on Netflix in 10 years, starring a mature but still dreamy Ryan Gosling.

Ah man, you've been into it that long? To be frank, the whole association with the Dark Net is what kept me at bay a few years ago. Obviously I could have looked at it from the currency point of view but I didn't see the possibilities. I thought it was just a currency anonymizer. 
I could buy 3-5 coins right now and potentially stomach some pain but it would only be worth it for a 100% return or more. I don't see that in the next 12-24 months but then again, I'm always wrong on Bitcoin.

If you buy the line that is pessimist you can buy cryptocurrencies on their way down, with the goal of having a rainy day fund. If there is a lot of fuss it my drive the market down some, and create buying opportunities. This country passed Healthcare reform and they are trying to undue it. Nothing is permanent. Even if it was approved it could be undone. Obviously draconian measures like this should never pass, but you know, dumbasses.

Let's break this down. How are they forces to give up their income. Income tax? Not an American idea. Blame the Egyptians. The Americans come in at 16th. Top countries are all Europeans, including those Germans ( who are known throughout history as Freedom Lovers.
Now I'm not going to sit here and defend the current American government for their ideals, but ultimately under our legal framework they were put in power by the (idiotic) people. Idiocy is not unique to American's by the way.
Most of history's asshole leaders are decidedly un-American.
In short nothing lasts forever, including current American political doctrine.
Now I was never arguing that life in America was perfect. i came here with about $1200 to my name, saved by my mother. Since then I've gotten a good education, made enough money to afford a large family, a few houses and every toy I could want. Now that I'm in the 1% I'm happy to pay taxes so that people that can't afford health care have something. 
But I get it, a lot of people hate America, and young people are angry at the establishment, whoever that seems to be.
However I can assure you that the majority of the world is far more oppressive to personal Freedoms (try speaking out against the Ruler or Head of Government publicly for a year. When I was growing up, people in Central and South America would disappear overnight for being desidents.)

The problem ultimately is not a country or government system but human nature. There is no fair system. The game favors the strong. Even in a crypto-state this is true, it just shifts power from one group of people to another.

You are on point on all accounts. I thought it was too expensive at $800, and then again at $1600...

It's all true. I mean my house is not giant giant, it's 2600 sqft. Pretty roomy though. I own several houses though so don't judge me on that one house.
What can I do? Send you a video of me in my undies taking inventory of all my possessions? I could but frankly, I'm not convinced you care. Like really care.
At this point I'm going to conclude that you are either a silly millennial who doesn't know better or you are older but under educated and thus not appreciated by society to your satisfaction.
Or is there an option C? Only you see the truth of what's really out there?
Put up or shut up Shill. Tell me why you think Americans lack freedom. Or some kind of argument beyond "lol, lmao" and winky faces.

I disagree. It's becoming so popular lately and the amount of money held totally is relatively small, that I think it has room to grow. The problem I see is people aren't trading it enough. The volume of trade is minimal compared to securities. This will change since it's only a matter of time before Bitcoin or a different cryptocurrencies becomes an SEC regulated security in the US.
The original intent notwithstanding, the world needs a unified digital currency that is not tied to one country and their economy.

I've never played Golf in my life and I'm proud of that.

I don't understand this post. If you were mining bitcoin and they suspected you would abuse the electricity somehow then I can see an Electric company maybe having doubts, maybe. But if you trade coins, what does that have to do with anything. This smells like there is something more to you and to this that you are letting on. Could you be flagged in their system for something other than being a simple bitcoin trader? Are you a haxor??

When I masturbate, I think not of humans having sex, but of trading assets and becoming unexplainably rich.
