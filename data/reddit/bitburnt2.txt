The exchanges as always do nothing to stop it this should be greatly alarming to everyone but all I hear is silence, will noone stand up for bitcoin?

I don't trust currencies backed by governments.
@_date: 2016-08-28 03:27:59
Arg this again when are we going to stop deluding ourselves and admit that there is serious problem with the price.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:06:04
Small marketcap, badly run exchanges who care more about insider trading then moving bitcoin to the big leagues, a community that doesn't see that the whole point is to replace fiat (I haven't seen anyone else bring this up this should unanimous among the community), people who think their coffee should be on the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:04:53
You could already see confidence for fiat weakening on the way to 20k it may take till 30 50 100k but eventually it will fall. The fiat system just losses value nobody benefits from it and it's all mostly digital anyway nothing lasts forever just because it's been around in our lifetimes doesn't mean it'll continue to be.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:09:25
Everything he said is correct nothing insane about it
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:12:15
No he's not, too much Supply at current prices the last thing anyone should do is put more Supply on the market
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:33:37
The whole point is to push the price up until the central bank's collapse that's not going to happen if you push it down too far scaring away buyers that's what's happening right now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:46:23
This ain't my first rodeo buddy please explain in detail how pushing the price up won't cause the population to lose confidence and shity Central Bank fiat insults are not an argument
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:10:33
So we're back to insults I guess... you didn't refute any of my counterpoints
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:16
This is definitely very disappointing to see we just made a lower low which is never what we should be doing
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:19:29
Hope you get some answers I've also wondered this 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:36:53
Glad to see someone else who understands that the whole point of bitcoin is too push the price up until the central banks collapse I've been saying that for years. Corrections and down trends are harmful because they destroy market confidence causing less people to invest when less people invest the central banks don't collapse. I've seen all this happen multiple times now and it's just as dissapointing as the first time we don't have to go through a downtrend again but probably will because people never change. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:30:56
I agree it's just very frustrating fiat money should be on its last legs by now.

They also said the owner sold his shares and that it's a scam those are the parts that I focused on

Mastercard could just use bitcoin if they wanted to, don't know why they feel the need to compete/attack it.

Google needs to stop dragging their feet and incorporate bitcoin, apple too.
@_date: 2016-03-07 18:23:57
Agreed around late June 2014 the manipulation really started we were beginning to move back up after the gox fiasco every attempt got dumped on and people would make excuses for why it's happening. I don't understand why the exchanges allow this to continue or how they remain blameless in the eyes of the community.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:06:14
Its a shame the exchanges don't use circuit breakers or try to discourage large downward price moves in any way  the exchanges don't care about bitcoin succeeding and are happy to insider trade among themselves.
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:17:20
The easiest way to encourage adoption is by the price rising over time and that hasn't happened in a substantial way in over 2 years. It's no surprise that everyone isn't using bitcoin we should be demanding higher and higher prices until everyone is using bitcoin and the central banks collapse. Iam sure I'll get attacked for this post just telling like it is.

Ah the classic another coin is going to take over fud.
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:22:55
Kinda makes you wonder why the exchanges didn't pause trading and halt withdrawals when bitcoin went sub 200 the other year.. they were probably in bed with the manipulators that did it.
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:01:58
Bitcoin represents an unique asset never before seen in history, my original post was meant to alert others that it is undervalued an has always been. My knowledge of economics is what led me  to bitcoin over 4 years ago.  
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:43:37
Care to dispute what I said other than "laugh" and down vote? 
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:18:24
Insults do not equal an argument.
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:08:05
Its still ridiculously undervalued 10 billion was acceptable in 2013 not in 2016 bitcoin should be in hundreds of billions by now. I just don't understand why people say they want bitcoin to be successful but also don't want the price to increase significantly.
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:33:16
The drop is further proof that the exchanges care nothing for the longterm success of bitcoin normal people don't adopt when the price is down trending. All the exchanges are at fault not just bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:45:48
This needs to be brought up more often I've been saying it for years keep pushing the price up until the central banks collapse. Many people believe bitcoin will crash to nothing this is not the case bitcoin has strong economics principles behind it, the central banks are the ones built on a house of cards.
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:11:26
People just need to grow a pair and not shit all over the price if a government pulls some BS, fiat will find a way in just keep moving the asks up you'll see how ineffective governments can be after a ban.

Ron Paul for Fed reserve chairman!
@_date: 2016-12-22 16:58:23
Its still incredibly undervalued we could have been above 50 billion in 2014 if it wasn't for malipulation and 100 by now. One thing I've learned in 4 plus years of being involved in bitcoin is too many involved in negative malipulation and cowardice (constant fears of government bans, scaling and another coin taking over). Why am I being down voted?

My fear is it will end up like constantly suppressd like GLD there's no reason for them not to take delivery of bitcoin it's not like it's barrels of oil.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:08:06
Never sell in a down trend you become part of the problem
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:00:10
Yes that's the problem it needs to be settled in bitcoin and not one legitimate reason why it shouldn't be.

Definitely made me think of bitcoin and then eminently sadden knowing that their won't be any commercials during the game.
@_date: 2016-09-05 18:04:04
No. Exchanges will continue to keep the price low thus giving no incentive for mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:15:14
People need to fight against this happening again it was detrimental to bitcoin. Right now people should refuse to do business below 4000 call out those who do for cowardly scum that they are.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:02:52
Simple to destroy the central banks.

 I would never respect somebody openly mocking Bitcoin I stand by my comments if contacted today she probably would still think she made the right choice. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:47:12
Yup but everyone is giving him what he wants (lower prices) what should have happened after his comments was a large pump (making him look foolish). I will never understand the logic of this market.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:53:07

I wouldn't sell my coins but I would spend them provided the price is acceptable, it hasn't for 3 years now.

Its unfortunate that we don't see more posts about the ongoing malipulation happening on the exchanges It's obvious that the exchange owners care nothing about the long term success of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 18:22:36
Lol agreed that "ghost money" part makes me think of fiat.
@_date: 2015-10-14 03:38:51
People who use the term "bagholder" its insulting and obviously trolling.
@_date: 2016-05-08 20:43:59
Not until the market is in the hundreds of billions of dollars this should be the goal of everyone evolved with bitcoin but its not, and that's why we remain a joke to everyone outside of the community.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:20:32
Bitcoin maybe surviving but its not thriving and that's the issue.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:26:21
This is completely disappointing  i now refuse to do business below 2000 and recommend not doing business below 2400 together we can end these ridiculous and unnecessary down trends. 2400 is an acceptable correction    anything below that frankly, is traders being the malipulatives that they are. Why do we always "have to retest lows" can't they just call it a day and continue the uptrend?  Why all the down votes check my history, I've been consistent with what I say?
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:08:35
They could come together putting pressure on the exchanges to end this low priced malipulation.
@_date: 2016-07-31 15:54:40
Just more negative malipulation same as we've had the last two plus years gotta fuck over the longs can't let them make any money. This causes a lack of market confidence further keeping people from adopting, does anyone else notice this?
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:11:27
Complete malipulation as usual the exchanges do nothing to stop it and users on here make excuses for it "this is bitcoin lol" make no mistake this is what keeps adoption from taking off.
@_date: 2016-07-15 18:16:27
Because for whatever reason the exchanges and the traders who trade on them don't want bitcoin to succeed, people just need to slowly over the course of months/years increase their asks until the central banks collapse then bitcoin can stabilize. Iam sure I'll get attacked for saying this.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:09:23
I'm glad to see that some on here are waking up to understand the whole point of bitcoin is the bring down fiat currencies. Many on here will still deny this basic premise for some reason.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:00:57
Refuse to do business below 2500 under any circumstances. The problem lies with a market composed of many individuals unable to come to a basic understanding as well as users unwilling to admit ( the whole point of bitcoin is too dethrone fiat currencies).
