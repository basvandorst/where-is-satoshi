The fact that TM is implausible doesn't make this specific theory more plausible, and you haven't really answered my question.  Freezing the cold wallet to track a criminal's funds would be about as useful as locking a bank's vault to track track them.  The cash in that vault isn't traceable to anything, it's the account records they would want.

Yeah, from a legal standpoint, it would be pretty uncontroversial for a court to view a warrant canary as a preemptive attempt to obstruct the judicial process and mandate something like continuing to publish it.  
I still like it, because what may be judicially uncontroversial is often publicly very controversial, as the public doesn't have the same tolerance for nuance that the legal community does.

It seems like you're trying to say that if you get paid in bitcoin and then spend the bitcoin, there isn't much the IRS can do.  Assuming you're a US citizen or otherwise subject to US tax law, this is inaccurate.  There's plenty the IRS can and will do, up to and including imprisonment.  The tax code applies to "all income from whatever source derived" and that includes payment in bitcoin, apples, or cocaine.  You owe the market value of that income minus relevant deductions, and you owe it in USD.  You're giving very dangerous advice that could imperil people's freedom

Exchange volume is the amount of BTC that changed hands in exchange for some other currency on the currency exchanges that bigterminal collects data from, which for bigterminal is bitstamp, btc-e, bitfinex, and formerly Mt. Gox, within a given time frame (here, discrete 24 hour periods).  Blockchain volume is the total amount of BTC that went from one bitcoin address to another in a given time frame (again, here, 24 hours).  
It is theoretically possible that exchange volume could be higher than blockchain volume if traders on an exchange didn't take delivery.  The actual bitcoin would sit on the exchange's wallet and never move, only the accounts with that exchange would be updated until the trader took delivery to an outside address.  The blockchain wouldn't record that as a transaction, because no bitcoin actually moved addresses, but this would also mean miners aren't going to receive any fee, because no blockchain transaction took place.  
If bigterminal's data is correct, it would mean that those four exchanges made significant trading fees for those 9 days, but that has nothing to do with hashing power, miners, or controlling the blockchain.

This is false.


As is this.  
The Civil Rehabilitation Law in Japan differs from the Corporate Reorganization Law in a few significant way, but an important similarity between both of them is the ability to **modify the rights of unsecured creditors**, up to and including unilateral discharge.  In layman's terms, this means they don't have to pay you back, as you are all unsecured creditors of the firm.

Blockchain.info absolutely does include transaction fees in their data, I can look at there data right now and I'm see that that's true.  Bigterminal isn't even talking about the blockchain in it's data, it's talking about exchange volume, which would only make up a portion of the blockchain and would never include blockchain transaction fees in their data, since they do not report on block creation (which wouldn't occur on exchanges).
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:25:52
Yeah, it's what got me to use them.  I would still use a dedicated account and only have one transaction out at a time, because they have had some technical difficulties (it took them 2 weeks to work through my first transaction, and a lot of angry emails), but they're certainly not malevolent.

Why is it highly unlikely that there is a glitch in the charts?  You think it's more likely that for nine days in a row, transaction volume on the exchanges that this site (I'm guessing from the outlay it's bigterminal) collects from were the exact same to a significance of 14 digits?  Unless all of the exchanges foreclosed every transaction where this mythical whale of yours traded, this is nearly impossible in terms of odds.  You have a better chance of randomly picking the right private key to a particular public key than you do of this happening without all exchanges trading exclusively.

Yes, things do, intrinsic value has a particular meaning in monetary theory, intrinsic value is that value an object has outside its use as a unit of account and exchange.  Bitcoins themselves do not have intrinsic value.

Blockchain.info is showing you total transaction volume across the block chain, bigterminal is showing you exchange transaction volume.  Do you understand the difference?  
And this actually proves you wrong, since the highest point in April 2013 is 668,896 BTC, and bigterminal is showing exchange transaction volume alone of 1,000,000BTC a day for 9 days.  Total BTC volume cannot be below exchange BTC volume, since exchange BTC is a component of total BTC.

Yeah, it's stupid from a purely practical standpoint, but they have rules for handling cash that are well defined and ensure, even if their is money laundering going on, they're not liable for it.  Until Bitcoin has clear rules, the fact that Bitcoin ATM implementations thus far have a relatively low risk of facilitating money laundering is irrelevant.  
There are actually a few firms in Vegas (my hometown) that are taking bitcoin by the reigns, and they're working on getting some ATMs on the strip eventually.  The Chinese love Vegas, and they love Bitcoin, so it's a natural fit, I just don't see casinos themselves touching it.
It's unfortunate, because that means a big benefit (never having cash when you're not in the protective bubble of the casino) is lost.

If all the citizens emptied their pockets, you'd have the national wealth, not GDP, these are two vastly divergent figures.  GDP is generally used as the base figure for national debt because most taxing regimes focus on this, and so it is a useful taxable base for comparison.  These are concepts you should understand, and the distinction between what a country's domestic production adds in value over the course of a year and national wealth is one you should comprehend well enough that conflating the two actually bothers you.  You still haven't answered me, why are you trying to teach others when you have clearly not even done basic education yourself?


Why?  I'm describing a market condition.  If I said "iPhones are extremely desirable right now," does that in any way mean *I personally* find them desirable?  I don't find them desirable, but their desirability is clear from the market demand for them.


You're not the one buying the debt, so who the hell cares whether you find it desirable?  Apple's going to do just fine with its iPhone despite the fact that I don't find it desirable, and I would be a myopic fool to claim my desire has any material effect on the iPhone's performance.  You seem to have trouble discerning the difference between the objective state of things, and your subjective view of them, which hardly inspires confidence in your capacity for normative analysis.  More troubling is that you seem to be under the impression that the US will have trouble paying a debt denominated in its own currency.  If you don't understand why that's ludicrous in all but a political sense, you're in serious trouble.  


It'll probably fluctuate, as it has historically, and remain between .7/1 and a 1.3/1 debt/GDP ratio.  Our relative debt servicing costs are the lowest they've been in decades, and based on current t-bill and t-bond maturity dates, that's going to continue for some time.  Most businesses operate with a debt level of around 30% of equity in perpetuity, and they don't seem to have a problem with it.  We pay our obligations when they come due, and that's why *whole other countries* are pounding at our door to buy our debt.  You are missing very basic, non-controversial concepts that you need to understand before you can even begin to have an intelligent conversation about this stuff, much less inform others about it.  Don't perpetuate ignorance in this subreddit, we have enough of it from detractors.  If you don't understand a subject, don't pretend you do.

That makes more sense, but as I see it, the main weakness in exchanges these days isn't poor coding, it's poor management that's then blamed on "coding."  The hard stop for Mt. Gox was that they weren't comparing their cold wallets total value to the total value of what they were purporting to hold.  Most everything to do with cold wallet generation should be done offline.  
So, this is a much better idea than I thought, since you could essentially code in best practices and verify that they're following them, but there's still always the fear of poor management.  If your manager is an idiot and loses or exposes the private keys to the cold wallets, no amount of coding in the world will help you.

I didn't say they couldn't transfer money to an account that wasn't yours, I said you can get it transferred to an account that *was* yours, and Coinbase's account wouldn't qualify.  They're restricting you from Coinbase, not from everywhere, and you can always withdraw it to an account with your name on it.  


Who said it was?  The UIGEA prevents funding of unlawful internet gambling, not gambling, or even internet gambling, writ large.  I don't know what Chase's explanation is for classifying Bitcoin purchases from Coinbase as likely to involve unlawful internet gambling, I could think of a few arguments though.  Lawful purchases and sales from a regulated investment market, on the other hand, are clearly not unlawful internet gambling.

Neither of those are particularly serious changes, but yes, if serious changes were made and not implemented properly, a material fork is possible.  It's unlikely to happen though, given that we have a pretty good understanding of how sustained forks develop now after the one that occurred about a year ago.  The main exacerbating factor is also severely diminished.  At the time, a single service, called "Satoshi Dice," accounted for almost half of all transactions.  This caused nodes and the blocks of miners closer to it to be more seriously divergent than the random spread throughout the rest of the network.

Read the section I quoted again, you're saying the Buyer's total cost in CNY is 2,315.69 for Paypal and 2,385 for Bitcoin.  2,315.69 is less than 2,385, which means Paypal costs less for buyers than Bitcoin.  
I think you just did something wrong with the conversions, because there's no way that 405.3USD equals fewer CNY than 388 USD.

If they have reason to suspect or believe that the transactions will end up at one of these sites:  or if they have reason to suspect or believe many of the transactions from a particular exchange or Bitcoin dealer are going there, they would have an obligation to prohibit transactions.  Sure, it's there interpretation of the activity, but the standards are amorphous, just as the standards for HSBC were, and Chase itself has had a fair number of egregious compliance violations lately.  
Really, none of what you've said supports your contention, which I was responding to, that the bank has no right to stop you from spending your money on gambling.  They do if they have reason to suspect that gambling is unlawful, and it's not just a right, it's an obligation.

Investment accounts are often gambling, but they're legal and regulated gambling, and so do not fall under the auspices of the UIGEA.  
Personally, I think Chase is overreaching in their interpretation (but then I don't like the UIGEA anyway, or any gambling regulations).  My guess is they don't think Bitcoin itself is unlawful gambling, but rather that it's a potential unlawful gambling payment processor, as there are unlawful Bitcoin gambling sites.

It's been used in experimental networks as a way to achieve terabit speed connections by aggregating multiple asynchronous Ethernet connections into a serial optical data stream.  It might be more accurate to say time-division multiplexing has been applied as a conversion mechanism, although the component 'streams' are still within the Ethernet framework.

When financial news sectors talk about money disappearing, they don't mean some USD or Bitcoins actually ceased to exist, they mean they're not where they were expected to be, e.g., at Mt. Gox.  You may disagree with his conclusion about regulation (although it's probably right, mainstream adoption would required regulation as most people wont trust it without that for the same reason they elected legislators that regulated banks), but he's not factually wrong or really disparaging Bitcoin.

I wouldn't worry too much about it, nobody really has an incentive to do that.  A large corporation wouldn't because once they hit &gt;50%, trust in the network would be lost and they'd be stuck with a giant electric bill and a useless system, it would be self defeating.  The US government wouldn't, because the departments with the capability to do that, the NSA and other components of the Pentagon, love bitcoin.  It's relatively easy for them to track and connect to an identity.  The only ones who might are China or Russia, because they don't have quite the "global adversary" capabilities that the US does, and so they can't always connect payments to identities, but that seems unlikely for a number of reasons.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:53:01
While I disagree with usrn that it's a payment system, although there is an inherent one like in any currency:
1. What market are you talking about?  The global market with widespread adoption?  No, not after only 5 years of development, how could it?
2. That's true in most currencies, and why most deposit-taking institutions in countries with well-established currencies are regulated.
3. The first is also true in most currencies, and the banking problem is an institutional one, not anything inherent about the currency.  
4. While probably not responsible for the dip we just got out of, a sizable portion of the bitcoin economy uses the currency as a medium of exchange.

An important use of Bitcoin is as a cross-border unit of exchange.  Cross border transactions under $10,000 USD where the parties use different currencies generally incur fees that represent a relatively high percentage of the transaction's total value.  With Bitcoin, this unnecessary administrative cost is significantly, allowing for those resources to be put to alternative productive use.  This will also mean that transaction that might otherwise not take place because their marginal benefit do not overcome that administrative cost may now be profitable.

People talk about it, but the reality is you'd never get a consensus on exactly *how* to do it, and you'd need a majority agreeing not just to do it, but the way in which to do it, in order to effectuate a hard fork.  If we didn't, the entire network could diverge significantly in several ways, and then everyone would lose everything.  It's not worth it.
I leave a fair bit of money at a few places, Bitfinex is a big one for me.  I could trade, for higher cost, at a well-capitalized and well-regulated ForEx market, but I take on the risk of Bitfinex being malevolent, and in return, I pay a little less.

I'm going to guess this is more than likely an error in the charts.  According to their full historical table of daily trading volume, on which this chart is based, the total BTC volume every day from 4/22/13 to 4/30/13 was exactly 1,000,000.0000000 BTC.  This from data that normally has a precision of .0000001BTC.  It is extremely unlikely that for 9 days in a row, discrete daily volume was not only 22 times the average daily volume from the preceding 10 days, but also the exact same number with a precision of 14 significant digits.
In addition, "Someone did 10mm in volume over 10 days" is just clearly false.  Ignoring that it was 9 days, it is extremely unlikely that one person was on one side or another of literally every exchange transaction over that period.

No they're not, which is why banks are generally taking an evaluative approach.  Notice here that there are plenty of Chase customers that have had no problem transacting with Coinbase.  ACH transactions reveal the name of the recipient, and I'm certain Coinbase hasn't lied on its banking documents about its name.  It would not be difficult for Chase to just prohibit all transactions with Coinbase accounts, but that's not what they do.  Instead, they do what their supervisory agencies have been telling them to do, take an evaluative approach to determine if this customer is likely using Coinbase as an intermediary to a gambling transaction, generally by analyzing the customer's transaction history and relationship with the bank.  


They would get exactly the same scrutiny, and are subject to the same ambiguous rationale.  They would argue they're subject to even more scrutiny, because they get it from the banks, and they get it from their regulators.

What is an "inflationary currency" exactly?  That term doesn't make much sense.

You've described the difference between a liquidation and a reorganization, both are bankruptcy, a state of legal insolvency, and both involve the discharge of debt.

While that's a terrible reason to mistrust Bitcoin as it has no substantive effect on the US economy, deflationary pressure is extremely concerning for any currency seeking stability.

So, the analog world would invalidate the legitimate currency of innocent people just to hurt the thieves?  I really don't understand what you're trying to say.

It's probably best not to discuss with Chase that you're involved with Bitcoin though, particularly if you have a substantial portion of your assets going into it.  From what people were saying, Chase seemed to have fears that some of these transactions are related to unlawful internet gambling.  After debating with some people here yesterday, I called up a friend who is the CCO of another large bank and asked them how they view Bitcoin.  They said the feeling among their peers is that they should review Bitcoin transactions on a case by case basis, and determine if the client's habits and past activity suggest they're using it to engage in gambling transactions or (prompting account restrictions), have an unusual charge-back ratio (prompting account closure) or money laundering (prompting SAR filings).  They don't really care that people put their money in Bitcoin, but they've had enough bad press about regulatory failures lately, and they're extremely nervous.

While I agree he's making a joke, I don't think the point of the joke is that the statement "Bitcoin is evil" is not his real opinion, it is.  He defends that position in his argument.  There is a bit of sarcasm, but its intent doesn't really absolve him of the statement.

Of course it is, because theft is socially defined, and tax, something that is socially approved of, does not fall into theft which, as a categorical requirement, demands social disapproval as a necessary condition.

Jesus, two of these idiotic arguments in one thread? Your existence is theft. That land you live on? Somebody one day just decided it was theirs. Same for the land your food is grown on, the minerals in it, the water you drink, it's all fucking theft if you decide that societal rules don't determine the allocation of resources.
If tax is theft, everything is theft.

Why on earth would you use a pro-government, 'do your part for the state' poster with the phrase "the peoples" on anything Bitcoin?  This just screams centralized planning and state control, both of which are the antithesis of Bitcoin.

Sure, bitfinex.com does.  You explain perhaps why bank lending would be more risky, but lending in general is actually harmed by an increase in M1, at least currently existing loans are.  Inflation hurts savers and lenders and helps borrowers.

His arguments never support his premise that Bitcoin is evil.  Yes, there is a store-of-value problem, but that is a trust issue, not, as he claims, a backing issue.  The promise to buy back dollars is not what makes the dollar a reasonable store of value, trust among market participants is (and, to a large extent, the tax issue).  The sole reason [Rai Stones]( can store value is that there is trust among market participants.  That's it.  There is no real backing to them, you can't do anything with them, it's purely trust.  The truth is, the same reality exists for gold.  While gold has some uses, those uses are limited by price, they don't set it or back it, it's value is based on trust.

Are you kidding?  Of course it does.  By fucking definition it does.  Get back on your meds bud.

Why do you think debt and bitcoin are not fundamentally compatible?  Several places allow to you to lend out your bitcoin at various rates.

The fraud bot is what's causing my problems, and the slow response times and false positive rate is absolutely their fault.

Of course it does, it sets out that no one owns anything except as how the society agrees they do.  Theft, like ownership, is socially defined, and tax is not socially defined as theft.  Your conception of the world is a logical impossiblity.
