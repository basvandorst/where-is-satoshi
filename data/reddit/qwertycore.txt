Not that this is relevant for my hypothetical, but you might what to refresh your memory of what CompuServe was in the 80-90’s before you dismiss it and anyone on it as non-tech savvy.

Then what are bitcoins?  Why should they exists? What it the point? I use a debit card. I use cash. I can't purchase things with out having the money. How is that different than bitcoins?  Or, restated, how is bitcoin different than debit cards or cash?  
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:31:13
I haven't bought on local bitcoins, but I don’t think I’m going to convince my mother to met some guy in a coffee shop and hand over $1,500.  Even if I did, most the conversion rates I’ve seen make Coinbase seem like a bargain.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:06:16
There is a learning curve to using BTC but it is transparent to the customer and offers them no perceived value.  If a vendor accepts goes out of its way to accept AmEx and I use Visa, I really don’t care,  I keep using my Visa.  Now if I am a AmEx user, they will probably get my attention.  On the other hand, if they offer me a 10% discount until the end of time if I use AmEx, I might be persuaded to go apply for a new card.
Keeping reserves for price fluctuations is a complete problem in itself.  I have been sidestepping it on purpose.  I suppose it in itself could wipe out any direct cost savings.
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:48:04
Maybe. Or maybe it’s someone who gave the ecosystem a chance and found no compelling reason to stay.  What I’m trying to say is to get the average mother into the ecosystem and keep her there is that you need to give her a reason.  I don’t (at this time) see any other player then the vendors who 1) have a reason to convince her to stay, and 2) have the means to do so.
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:28:13
Yes, on the surface.  For that hypothetical $1,000, if paid in BTC the vendor receives $1,000. If a CC was used the fee could be almost 3% plus a flat fee.  Now, bake into that the reserves held for chargebacks, fraud, any other CC related costs  the percentage will probably rise closer to 5%.  So for $1,000 BTC the vendor gets $1,000, with CC purchase the vendor get about $950.  If affect, the vendor is happily pocketing the evil CC fees with no additional service the the customer.  Who would you say is taking advantage of whom?
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:41:34
Well, no. She didn’t need a credit card or credit.  All she needs is a bank account, that is what my example (Coinbase) is using. I set up a bank account four weeks ago and it took me less than one half hour.  With that I got a fee debit card (that I did have to wait two days for).
Without a true CC for an ‘Instant buy’, she will always be waiting 4 days for the BTC.
Please correct me if I’m mistaken, but the USA of which my mother is a part on of the largest consumer economies.
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:11:59
I’m still out on Circle, but how can they make any difference without the help of vendors?
The problem is (currently) is that all the advantages of CC transactions goes to the customer and all the disadvantages are the vendors.  Most customers don’t see this nor do they have any reason to.  What does the customer see? Instant transactions, no fees, 1% cash back, airline miles, fraud protection to name a few.  Also, almost universal acceptance.  What does BTC (currently) offer to the **customer**?
CC companies (and consumers) have boxed the vendors in, if they don’t accept CCs customers will go elsewhere. McDonalds is accepting CC charges for a $1 cup of coffee (with no signature), would they be doing that if the customer didn’t demand it?
Debit cards tried to take a shot at the CC companies and where did they end up?  If I remember correctly, the CC’s put conditions in their contracts that vendors could not offer/publicize a discount without being penalized.
Until there is a **compelling** reason for consumers to forgo all the advantages of using a CC (payed for by the Vendor’s fees), BTC will not go mainstream.  The only way to do that is to make the CC disadvantages the consumer’s problem, or better stated, make the advantages of BTC the customer’s advantage. I don’t see this happening until we see across the board discount of 5%-7% for use of BTC.

2) Fiber. Bio-Tech.  Bubble memory. Dot-coms.  People can have herd mentality (yes, even ‘smart’ people).  As I said, I was hoping I didn't have to get into this but it does exist.  Things can have perceived value without real value.
4) Yes. But aren't you waiting and hoping on me?  Why should my mother become one of the consumers wanting to spend bitcoin? 
5) In theory, anything can happen. How do you move it from theory to reality?
I have read a number of articles that I’ve been referred to by Mr. Krawisz. He has a degree in Physics and is not an economist, who co-founded the Crypto-Anarchy Club at UT.  What economic credentials does he actually have?  Has any of his work been peer reviewed?  Why should I respect his opinions?
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:05:39
Yes, I know.  I was hoping to keep that part of the equation constant for the hypothetical.
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:52:40
2) I don’t what to get too far into this.  I’m hoping that you will agree that just because it’s growing in value doesn't mean its useful, there are many other things that could cause that.  Just look to the past.
4) The chicken and the egg isn't required to snowball.  It can result in a race condition.  I hope your view is the correct one but I would like to think there is more that can be done than wait and hope.
5) No, it is not mainstream in my area, but I wish it was.  The original post came from me thinking about how to help.  How can it be made a " compelling case"?
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:17:11
No, that doesn't make sense.  I have cash and a debit card.  With those, I can't spend what I don't have.  You have BTC, you can to can buy things without actually having the money (using credit), it called a credit card.
You have avoided the question. I don't understand why this is so hard to understand, why should my mother use bitcoins when her debit card does everything (from her perspective) that bitcoin does?
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:58:36
I think it is.  The discussion is about how to get BTC in mainstream use.  My mother is the mainstream and I’ll go out on a limb and assume yours is to.  Either way there are a lot more of them out there then there are of us, and they need a tangible reason to use BTC.
The question is, who other than the vendors can provide it?
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:15:19
True, but there is no reason for the customer to want to pay using BTC, so this doesn't really get us anywhere.
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:22:03
At what point is this FUD?  I’m am trying to make the point that if BTC is going to go mainstream for customers, they need a compelling reason to do so.  Who can provide that reason other than the vendors that they are doing business with (who will also realize a great business advantage)?
Look at what a CC offers the consumer, no fees, cash back, airline miles, extended warranties, return protection, theft protection, etc.
What does BTC offer? None of the above.  What is it going to offer? Probably none of the above.
The only way I can see to combat this is for vendors to show them the real cost of using that piece of plastic.  What better way than to discount the cost off when using BTC?
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:19:51
1) True.
2) It’s the ‘probably’ part I’m trying to address.
3) I haven’t read that.  I will as soon as I can.
4) Maybe.  But that is how it works now.  It won’t be easy until its mainstream and it won’t be mainstream until it's easy.  Chicken and the egg.
5) I have seen some of the discounts from Dell (which are not across the board) but I haven’t looked at Newegg.  Other than that, I don’t know how to respond to this. Maybe they have it figured out. If the non-financially privileged are making it work and making it mainstream - how?
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:00:56
OK.  I think this is corny.  I also think it has a lot of merit if fleshed out across the Internet. How would someone get it started?
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:31:27
I see a lot of value in remittances, but trace the whole cycle.  If we do not have mainstream acceptance of bitcoin what does that achieve?  I send bitcoin to my homeland. What happens then? Can I buy food from the vendor?  Can I pay a bill?  Can I convert it into the local currency?  What would be the point?
Offshore oil deposit - you lost me on this one unless you are trying to hide money.
Consumer adoption is what this whole discussion is about. 
Black market...does anyone really what to go there?
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:55:47
I *am* getting  "whenever and wherever it's convenient”.  The scenario I layed out is how a person would enter the BTC world.  Do you think its convenient?  I don’t and I can assure you my mother will not either.  If we accept that there is some learning curve or barrier to enter the BTC world, what incentive is there to the common person?
My main point is that if **vendors** what to free themselves of the sole costs of using CC **they** need to provide the consumer incentive.  No one else will. 
As for the remittance market, I do not think it is not material for this discussion (mainstream customer acceptance).
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:51:08
My point is, no one is looking at this from the consumer's point of view.  Yes, it can be convenient, but swiping a CC is just as convenient.  Why should a customer change?  If I’m in a store selling a hot dog for $1 why should I go down the road to another vendor selling the same hot dog for the same dollar?  What is in it for the customer?

And we could do this narrative with pharmaceutical drugs, energy sources, new propulsion techniques, medical devices, etc.  We could even narrate that since Sergei is not at the forefront of farming technology, he is at the bottom of the pyramid, and thus subject to the follies of Big Agribusiness.
How does this apply to the original thought?
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:31:19
I didn't say the BTC transaction was slow but the **cycle** was, and it cost her money.  And why should it need to be explained?  In the real world, she types in a debit card number and she is off and running.  **Why** should she learn about something doesn't affect her?  Remember, she is not exposed to all the waiting and cost and pain until BTC is involved.  What is her compelling reason for doing so?
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:23:25
Maybe I need to restate this.  The first world countries already have, from a customers perspective, all the advantages of bitcoin.  From my mother’s perspective her debit card gives her free, instantaneous transactions.
My mother has never run a business. She does not see, as most the people here do, how much that debit card is costing her because it is hidden in the price of whatever she is buying.  How many US CC users do you think realize  the cost of all the ‘free’ perks that their CC offers them is being paid for by **themselves** through the fees inserted in the purchase price?  
The CC have worked very hard convincing the average customer the CC use is free.  Until someone shows them the otherwise they will continue to use their CC.  
In other words, the US is not being left out, but it has no compelling reason to opt in.
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:52:55
You are correct. I am looking at it from my mother’s (USA’s) point of view. But, if BTC wants widespread acceptance, can it afford to leave one of the largest consumer economies out?
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:00:16
Well, no.  At no point did she use a CC.  The waiting was caused by the bank and the funds transfer.  You are partially reinforcing my point.  Normally the vendor would be doing all the waiting, now she is.  How does using BTC help her, the customer?  She is now the one waiting and paying all the fees.  Why would she choose to do this when she could just type in her Debit card number and be one her way?  What is in it for her?
Giving her the bitcoins is a nice sentiment but it is not going to scale up to mainstream acceptance. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:08:19
I will look into this.  I imagine that it would be ‘ebay’ like enough to be comfortable for a mom.
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:32:57
And you are exactly right.  
You don’t care how they got that piece of plastic either.  They could have gotten it from a bank or they could have paid $10 to load $100 on that prepaid card.  Its not your problem and it should not have to be.
You will accept any way that you can, but each form has some pro and cons.
Cash - easy and permanent.  Hard to do over the Internet . Security problems with large amounts.  Possible fraud risk with counterfeit bills. Proceeds readily usable with most vendors.
CC - Easy, Internet friendly and fast, sort of.  High fees, charge backs, contractual restrictions. Proceeds readily usable with most vendors.
BTC - (Almost) Instantaneous transfers, Internet friendly, permanent. No fees. Limited use, volatility issues (which I am ignoring right now). Proceeds (currently) unusable with most vendors.
Its up to you to weigh  the pros and cons of each and which it the best for you.
Does BTC emerge as your top choice? Why not? What does Bitcoin need to offer **you** to promote BTC?  What do you need from Bitcoin to make it a **better** way to feed your family?
I think vendors are the linchpin for Bitcoin.  Vendors are what will make it or break it and without them it will not succeed.  Bitcoin needs to focus on the vendor’s needs, who will then focus on the consumer.
From your post, I don’t see you as for or against bitcoin.  Fair enough.
I think do think an interesting question you could answer is: what would make you a proponent of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:45:17
No its not, but I don’t think this analogy works.  Let’s say the vendor want to accept Pesos.  What compelling reason does a customer have to pay in Pesos?  They will just drive the mile down the road to next gas station and use their CC.  The CC accepting station survives and the Pesos one closes.  Yes, the vendor might have a compelling reason to accept BTC but the customer does not so they just move on and vote with their (readily available and comfortable) dollars.
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:36:17
No, she was still on CompuServe.
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:58:01
We are getting into the hypothetical hypothetical here, but what is to keep someone from granting credit using the blockchain to record that credit?  BTC credits/loans are already being done at BTCJam.
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:16:41
She needs to buy gas and the gas station doesn't accept BTC.  She not a revolutionary or visionary, she is just someone try to get by.
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:33:32
That’s the point. 
Why would anyone do it without some compelling reason to do so?
Without the vendors offering the compelling reason, who else can?
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:09:32
Because the Internet gave her a reason to use it.  Who do you see going giving her a reason to use BTC if not the vendors she is doing BTC business with?
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:19:57
If I could offer a word of caution here.  Mr. Krawisz might understand cryptography but that has no intrinsic value to the discussion of bitcoin or its future.  The fact that I understand the Carnot Cycle in no way translates to me being able to build a engine, much less being able to predict the modern US car based society.
Caveat emptor.
