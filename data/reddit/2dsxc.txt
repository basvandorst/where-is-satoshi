You can trade in dildos for all I care.

Growth takes time, you'll jump ship to bitcoin (cash) eventually.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:46:56
Bitcoin Cash 
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:04:53
Well considering that the only people calling it Bcash is this little echo chamber I don't feel there's much risk in it formally changing. Eventually it will just be called Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:53:29
Switch to Bitcoin Cash if you want to use bitcoin. Segcoin is an altcoin.

Don't sell your hedge, that's what fools do (and what made me a lot of money).
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:28:18
I use it and will continue to use it because it is bitcoin. Not your blockstream controlled segcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:30:34
it says nothing, go outside and play
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:32:51
It's also better than blockstreamcoin
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:20:39
Yes but for 3 years prior I never bothered to create a reddit account and was always deeply disgusted by blockstream and their vain attempt at controlling bitcoin. 
The truth of the matter is Bitcoin (Cash) will succeed because it isn't constrained by a malicious private business. Cryptocurrency will only succeed by remaining decentralised, which legacy bitcoin most certainly is not.
Enjoy your ridiculous transaction fees and lengthy wait times and remember, Bitcoin (Cash) will always be cheaper because you cannot have a middleman taking a cut and expect to offer a cheaper service. 
Bitcoin (Cash) will grow organically as it ages simply because people will take heed of it's reliability, low cost and speed. Exactly as legacy Bitcoin did until blockstream got their claws in it.

It's funny how you people claim a man who is far more successful than ALL of you is somehow crazy for supporting the only bitcoin that exists.
It's nothing short of baseless slander, perhaps consider exiting this echo chamber and you'll realise why bitcoin is an altcoin, blockstream and core are your enemies and Ver is the only person with the capital to stop them.
Don't be a bagholder now, buy bitcoin cash.

No at the moment it is called Bitcoin Cash but eventually it will just become Bitcoin as legacy Bitcoin dies off. In reality though legacy Bitcoin should be renamed because after segwit is activated it is no longer Bitcoin.

I bought them at $200, thanks, retards!
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:26:11
It's actually called Bitcoin Cash, not Bcash, try not to get confused
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:59:04
That's just straight up nonsense, when BCC overtakes legacy the market will react positively. It confirms that cryptocurrency cannot be controlled by banksters.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:42:55
There was a non-malicious miner kickstarting the network with over 50% of the hash but that is no longer the case.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:07:43
you're all hypocrites, when the time comes to dump and try to kill the bitcoin cash network you'll all start profit trading instead
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:59:29
you're deluding yourself, segwit only slightly increases the amount of transactions that can fit in a block and enables a host of security concerns and centralization.
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:58:18
I think you guys need to study blockstream's plan a bit more, maybe exit this echo chamber for a while. Read up on perhaps. There will be no centralized lightning network, the miners will never accept such a thing, they will simply fork away and leave bitcoin to the banksters you morons are currently (illogically) aligned with.
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:08:19
Are you joking? Blockstream are destroying bitcoin with their 1MB nonsense. These two are trying to save bitcoin.
