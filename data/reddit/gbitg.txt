moon is not an absolute price level, is relative to the price you bought. I would say 1000x your initial investment is moon. For someone is 10 bucks (they bought at 0.01) for someone else is 10000 and for others is 100000

Actually the achievement  is unanimous trustless consensus between multiple parties aka bizantine agreement.

"consult a tax professional who knows about crypto".... AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, 99.9% of people are clueless, "tax professionals" included. They don't even know what asymmetric encryption is, how it works and why it works. If you "consult" one of those people they will go for the maximum allowed tax possible, just to not incur in any problem with the taxman. They will make you pay 50% in taxes, the taxman is happy, you don't get any problem, they don't get any problem. 50% you know... just to be sure it is the "correct amount of taxes to pay"

and remember: when you buy from Coinbase they just update your bitcoin balance on their MySQL database. So your X amount of bitcoins you just bought is "assigned to you" from the pool of hardware wallets they are managing (there are only an handful of hardware wallets, not 1 for every customer) Withdraw your bitcoins for peace of mind, this forces them to actually send out bitcoins to addresses you control

you can ban at the edge (exchanges, banks and such) but you can't ban Bitcoin itself. Localbitcoin or decentralized exchanges can't be banned (good luck banning wire transfers from person A to person B. At the very end, bitcoin for cash will be still available. You can earn bitcoin from labor, no need to "buy" coins. Bitcoin is useful and it exploits greed from people to enforce its trust-less network. As long as people are greedy Bitcoin will survive, good luck telling all the miners they should stop mining, good luck telling all the hodlers they should wipe their wallets, good luck undoing Bitcoin from history :-)

define "too much". It uses the energy required to preserve its security at any given time. Let it require less, let the proof of work be super easy and everyone can double spend bitcoins which means  everyone is bitcoin rich which means no one is which means bitcoin value drops to zero. Now, digging gold is too expensive right?, let's cheat, lets change the "rules" and find a way to dig gold cheaply and at near zero cost: now everyone can dig gold for free, everyone now has humongous quantities of gold forever, everyone is gold rich which means no one is, gold value drops to zero. Acquiring a scarse token is expensive by definition of scarse, make it easy and it's not scarse anymore thus can't it be used as store of value

If you are italian you should already know that in Italy nothing is clear. Paying taxes is a mess. No-one knows, accountants don't know.. usually people do what other people have been doing, that's the general rule. As far for crypto, again, no one knows... someone says yes, someone says no. The general rule: if you get some money into your bank account you have to declare something. The "something" is the hard part. Other option: convert bitcoin into monero, from monero into bitcoin and then convert in fiat with cash in person. Totally anonymous, totally untraceable, totally tax free. Don't do it. Pay your taxes

I'm going to make many people cringe here but you can think of Bitcoin as a BitTorrent network where people exchange tokens called "bitcoins". It is purely decentralized, peer 2 peer. Can't be stopped... just like BitTorrent even the creator himself is powerless. Those tokens are scarce and unforgeable, they can only be acquired or handed over to other people. Period. That's the (very crude) "What". For the "How" please refer to Andreas Antonopulous and his many talks on youtube

Let's say there are 2^128 private keys out there (not going to happen in the history of mankind but it's good enough for my example). So a 50% chance of guessing any seed is 2^128 (1/2 of the 2^256 available keys). This is equal to winning 5 powerballs in a row. Good luck! Oh, I forgot, only a fraction of all the Bitcoin private keys actually contains any funds

From my understanding futures are bettings against future price of Bitcoin. You can bet $1000 that tomorrow the price will be &gt;X. Futures allow for a very speculative trading. If you just buy bitcoins you are "betting" too but the winnings and losses are tied to the price of bitcoin itself. With futures you can speculate on Bitcoin and you decide how much you are betting, not the price of bitcoin itself

let's make it clear one for all:
the chances of winning the US powerball is 1 in 300 million (300 millions is approx 2^28 )
the chances of guessing a Bitcoin private key is 1 in 2^256
so the chances of guessing a Bitcoin private key is at least equal to winning the US powerball approximately 10 times in a row (256 / 28 approx 10). Not once, not twice... 10 times in a row.  I think it's much much much more rational to have a try at the US powerball once

MY INVESTMENT ADVICE: buy once (or DCA) and then hodl no matter what. Cash out just the bare minimum you need (if you ever need it) and keep the rest growing. Give the middle finger to: banksters, china, bans, fomo, politics, people over 60 talking about this stuff, buthurts and last but not least whales. Real and good end goal: be part of a revolution. Bad end goal for losers: make quick buck and "cash out"

My dear friend, the freedom to manage your own wealth don't make people more evil than when they operate through a bank. Bad people do bad things regardless, bank policies or Bitcoin, it doesn't matter, they don't follow the rules, they don't follow the "policies". On the wire transfer description, they don't write "to fund ISIS", they send money from Joe Foe to Mr Green, normal persons with very western names that know people that know people that know people connected to ISIS. Policies are constantly avoided. Instead, good people get massive problems from bank policies and get great benefits from Bitcoin

Ill not stress it enough. THERE IS NO LIMBO IN BITCOIN. THERE'S NO SPOON!!! :-) Either the transaction got included in a block or it is not.. there's no situation in which you don't have the funds in BOTH the sender and the receiver. You either still have your funds in your sender device OR you have your funds in your receiver device.
What happened is that your transaction made it into the mempool and got stuck due to high congestion. No problem, as long as you have your TWO seeds (seed 1 for the receiver and seed 2 of the receiver device) you are fine 
Option no.1: wait for the transaction to unstuck
Option no.2: rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee, yes you heard me right, double spend your own transaction
Option no.3: use the built in feature to increase the fee (can't remember the name)

bitcoins are not "stored". Your HD stores the private key which is used to move your bitcoins on the blockchain. Your Chrome app just tells the HD the destination address and the amount to send, the HD signs the message with its private key and spits out the signed transaction. The Chrome app gets the signed transaction and propagates it to the network. Your private key never leaves the HD. Actually it leaves your HD just 1 time, during setup, in the form of a BIP39 24 words seed so you can read it and copy on paper. If you HD breaks or freezes or whatever you can restore the deterministic wallet from the seed

your coins are safe. There's no limbo in Bitcoin like with traditional banking. Your transaction is still unconfirmed meaning that it hasn't been included in a block which in turn means the coins haven't moved from your wallet, even if your wallet thinks the funds are not there anymore

ahahah if it was 51% likely it would require 3 or 4 attempts to get it done. 51% is the number of nodes you have to "convince", not the probability of the attack. Convincing 51% of the nodes is the probability of convincing 1 note, let's say 1/p, and multiply it for the number of nodes. So probability of a 51% attack is 1/(p^(N/2)) where 1/p is the probability of convicing 1 node and N is the total number of nodes. I understand that the probability of convincing 1 node may increase depending on the number of "already convinced" nodes, but you know... it's still unfathomably low...

I don't get why people don't get it. Writing a block on the blockchain is purposely expensive otherwise anyone could change the data. Miners don't cheat because when you put $100000 dollars of electricity at stake just to write a single block you don't want  your block to be rejected by the network :-)
Having a 0 effort blockchain would be like having a 0 effort gold mining technique. Everyone could have endless amount of gold, everyone would be "rich" and at the same time no one would be it anymore. Gold loses its store of value property if it is easy to mine and acquire. So, as humans, we masochistically decided to self impose to ourselves to use a hard to find metal. Same for Bitcoin, a self imposed but necessary work

It is a pointless work pretty much like digging the ground for the 79th element in the periodic table. The work is necessary to make writing to the blockchain extremely expensive. This way consensus can be achieved because people are putting their effort at stake and they are more likely to write the truth (otherwise nodes will reject their write and they will lose money and time and effort). Editing the past stuff is also not possible because it would require a massive amount of energy no one has, even a cartel of miners. If writing was cheap then C# wouldn't exist

it always boils down to receiving money on your bank account. Banks are the surveillance institution used by governments. If you receive money on your bank account then you have to declare it and pay your taxes.

You know why they put on hold your account when you want to move your bitcoin? Because they don't have them! I'll explain. When you purchase bitcoin from coinbase they just update a number on your html page, no actual bitcoin is moved or allocated or whatever. Seriously, they go for the path of least resistance they can get away  with, and updating your bitcoin balance on their MySQL database is just that. Then, when you want to actually move "your" bitcoin to an address you own, they get the reality check which is providing the actual bitcoin to you and move them. In order to do so, they put you on hold, they start to do crazy checks on your profile and what not, then they provide the precious asset to you. They can't cheat, hard proof will be on the Blockchain, so they take all the precautions necessary before moving the bitcoins. Please remember folks, before you move your bitcoins outside coinbase you actually own fairy tales on a MySQL database

I don't bother to encode the start of the chain. There are only two possible directions and I will forget about the different dent style anyway. I prefer to keep it simple. In the future I prefer to count the links and have 11 * 24 = 264 of them knowing there are two possible directions

Destroying the wallet would be extremely elaborate and difficult too: can't just throw it in the trash. Either you have to twist all the links and get a chain of all twisted links or you have to cut and detach every single link from the chain (splitting the chain in half is not enough, splitting in three is also not enough and so on..)

Why full nodes need to NAT a port to offer the service is beyond my comprehension. Ok, without an open port they can't receive incoming connections but they could still fully operate by connecting once to external reachable nodes and offer the service through them. It doesn't matter who originates the connection, the important is to establish it.
Tor nodes dont require open ports and can happily serve incoming request originating from external clients

The 12 words are just a way to encode the original seed in a easy and convenient way, so the word seed is as secure as ECC itself.

Transaction history is necessary to bootstrap a node from the genesis block up to the latest one. TH node, while downloading the blockchain, verifies that sufficient work has been made to build the blocks. If that's the case, the blockchain is genuine. No one today can create a different, parallel, perfectly valid chain starting from the genesis block. Transaction history is unnecessary in MimbleWimble, a genius work which exploits some interesting properties of elliptic curves.

10 minutes, it's a Poisson probability distribution. It cant be 5 minutes because 10 is not the maximum time to wait. I would like to add that "confirmed transaction" doesnt really mean anything. What you are asking for is the average time to inclusion on the next block, which doesnt confirm anything. For a transaction to be "sufficiently confirmed" (i.e. negligible double spend probability) you should wait that your transaction get buried 6 blocks deep into the blockchain

very simple, it requires 12! attempts. That's it 12 factorial.

For example, if you have three elements A,B and C and you want to find out the number of possible permutations just compute 3! which is 3x2x1 = 6. So in general, given N elements, the number of permutation is N! = N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)......1

The Merkle root allows a node to: 1 verify that the transactions haven't been tampered with and 2\) to verify that a given transaction is in a block without asking for all the transactions \(the latter would be necessary if we were using a normal hash instead of a Merkle root\). The node just need to ask Log\(N\) hashes in order to verify that a given transaction is included in a block. Otherwise it would need to ask for all the transactions. Why this is important? It allows for very fast checks and nodes can be small and not so powerful, thus increasing the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Most people don't get the 2\) and they don't really know why a Merkle root instead of a normal hash. If we only had to anti\-tamper the transactions, a normal hash \(e.g. SHA256\) would be enough.

I would start asking to myself how many people I told about my webserver.

An IP address is not very useful di per se but you can ask the hosting company.

I think the most sensible thing to do would be to release the private key to the user upon account termination, thus offloading all the responsibilities to the user. I know that given the current Coinbase system design that might be not possible (i.e. ther's no such thing as a 1:1 mapping between user accounts and private keys) but it could be done if for every user account there's a master seed stored in the db.

I think the best way would be to tell Coinbase that you just sent funds to an old address belonging to your now closed account. It easy to verify that you are the owner of that address (in fact, you were).
According to their FAQ:
you are on the second scenario "Sent to digital currency address". On that scenario, Coinbase suggests you should contact the "receiving party" which in your case it's yourself. The "wrong destination wallet" is your now closed account.
Please tell them that. This should put Coinbase on a support case scenario they actually expect to happen
best of luck

I think you can simplify further by removing the concept of hash and difficulty. Just say there is a puzzle to be solved, puzzle which depends on the data on the previous block and on the transaction data of the block you are trying to create. That's it, no hash, no difficulty level, no "many 0s on the hashed string" etc.. I think that's an implementation detail you can avoid completely

why? do you find idiotic to have $100 worth of gold? 1Kg of gold is to damn expensive! The reference value "1" is just that.. a reference value.. you could move it and it wouldn't change a thing. Usually "1" is set on a very convenient place so 99% of the stuff around you is priced in the range 0,+50... this way people can work out other prices fast, it would be very annoying to have 1 USD set as the price of an average house :-) I think in the future we'll use other altcoins for day to day purchases and btc will be the main "bank account". You'll "withdraw" some litecoins from your btc stash and use them to buy stuff daily in a more convenient and fast way. Probably you'll pick the altcoin that suits more the task you want to do, you'll get some litecoins in your pocket for fast and small purchases, moneros for anonimous payments, ethereum for setting a smart contract. People will accept other alts as they will know that they can convert them back to bitcoin whenever they want. Bitcoin will be the main store of value, backing trust and faith on all the other alts... In fact, gold did the same until recently ;-)

1) how do you convince all the partecipants to move into a given country? are you willing to move? :-) 2) why you think that physically moving "inside the borders defined by someone" will make a node automagically to accept the new rule ? 3) cartel cannot form with thousands and thousands of partecipants, that's called market, not cartel :-)  Take BitTorrent as an example. You made a new version which enables you to be a privileged users and to download faster and with higher priority with respect all the other nodes. Your government gives you the "right" to create such network but all the nodes have to be in your country for the law to be effective and (of course) the node have to run your client. Now I ask you: How do you convince all of the bittorrent partecipants (including me) to move into a given country? And when inside that country, how do you convince the nodes to run a specific version of bittorrent? The best you can do is to convince a subset of nodes to run your client but that's not bittorrent anymore, it's just another network.. you hard forked away from bittorrent and you are running your own network. All the other nodes keep doing what they were doing, without asking permission

they simply can't change the rules to their benefits. Let's say they increase the block size to 2MB to gain more transaction fees (Bcash ehm ehm) :-) They will have to convince all the nodes to accept this new type of block. Majority of nodes will be like: "nope, invalid block! rejected!". And they wasted 10000s of dollars on the new block. So miners will start gradually, mining the new and the old type of block, just to not waste money. A minority of nodes may accept the new type of block and there you go the hard fork is born. In Bitcoin you don't force a change in the rules, you fork yourself out

I'll try to explain Bitcoin mining exactly how I'd like someone explain it to me. Mining is the process of collecting the current pending transactions from other users, collecting them into a block of 1 megabyte or less and then appending this block to the current head of the blockchain (the blockchain is a.... chain of blocks :-) ). The protocol rewards you a given amount of bitcoins for the trouble. Problem is, if mining was so easy, anyone could take a block, change it (maybe increasing the amount of bitcoin to itself) and then declaring the block as the valid one. Instead, producing a block is incredibly expensive, to date it costs ten of thousands of usd dollards to produce one. How can it be so difficult? Creating a block requires solving a very complex puzzle plus packing the transaction together. The puzzle is dependant on the transactions and on the previous block) so you cannot "save" the solution for the next block. Why the protocol deliberately makes so difficult to create a block? Answer: to prevent changes by malicious people. You see, blockchain is just a ledger of transaction, declaring how much bitcoin everyone has. No one on earth can get a block, change it and then save it on the blockchain, especially if this block is not the head of the chain but maybe 2 or 3 level down (as I said, the solution for the puzzle of each block is dependant on the previous block). So in order to change one block one would need to   alter the block data (very easy, it's data), recompute the puzzle solution (ultra expensive) and also recompute all the puzzles for the subsequent blocks. An unfathomably expensive task, even a miner cannot do it. Thus blockchain is immutable (I mean, the data written on it is immutable, at least the data under a couple of blocks). Thus everyone can trust the data written in the blockchain, thus everyone can trust anyone else balance. Final goal of Bitcoin: a network of people where no one trust each other but they still can trust each other because they trust the data on the blockchain. Blockchain is the mediator by means agreement is reached, and you don't need to trust anyone to operate Bitcoin. It is a solution to the Bizantine Agreement problem, problem thought to be unsolvable. I think it is the greatest achievement in human history after public private cryptography, even that one was a problem thought to be unsolvable: transmitting an encrypted message without exchanging the key beforehand: impossible! :-)

Point 2: you are self employed, you should know the real meaning of money... money is not just a tool to "buy stuff", it's a language and it's control. Tell your wife about this, she doesn't like her job so I presume she's an employee (can't work for yourself if you hate what you do), ergo she sees money as a "buy stuff" tool..  people with "buy stuff" mentality will evaporate millions in a matter of a couple of years... be careful and play wisely  P.S. you said "Bitcoin may crash to $1000..." uhm, that's not someone hodling for so many years would say...

Look, I'm a software engineer. The very idea that you can block a protocol is flat non sense. You can attack a specific implementation of a protocol but not the protocol itself. Hollywood and Sony have been trying to stop bittorrent for 10 years and more. A bitcoin transaction can be encoded as emoticons on a skype message or it can be transmitted over ham radio or it can be written down on a piece of paper... slower? Yes. Blocked? No. Data trascends the medium over it is transmitted, it is possible to block the medium but not the data itself

uhm why? To create a PayPal account you don't need to provide details about your bank account, just a username and password which can be whatever. The buyer creates a *new* PayPal account with a new username and password not tied to anything else, then procedes to send some funds into it. Then he/she passes username and password to the seller effectively making the seller the new owner of the PayPal account which in turn makes the seller the owner of the funds. Think of it like a disposable PayPal account that only purpose is to act as a container for the funds

when you get paid $10 do you call the Federal Reserve and ask for details about how a real banknote should look like? Do you go online and check how a 10 dollars banknote should look like, features and all? Or do you just accept the fact that the buyer most likely doesn't have a printing machine at home and doesn't go around having free beers, scamming people?
Now the Bitcoin one: when you receive a Bitcoin payment of $10-$15 do you wait for a confirmation (possibly 5-6) or do you just accept the fact that most likely the buyer is not performing a incredible expesive and massive 51% attack just to grab some free beer? I know that a double spend is almost for free but what's difficult is to convince the network that the double spent transaction is the one to be included in the next block. Otherwise is pretty much random which one get confirmed

cracking doesn't imply having a computer fast enough to bruteforce any hash. In fact, it is proven impossible to reverse an hash because for the Pigeon Principle (yes, that's the name) for any given hash strings there are an infinite number of input strings that hash to that given hash output. Cracking means breaking the underlying math involved, like MD5 for example. BTW want the proof that reversing an hash is impossible? Here we go: there are a finite number of SHA256 hashes, they are 2^256. There are an infinite number of input strings. Every input string can be hashed so for every output hash there are an infinite number of input strings. Thus reversing an hash is impossible as you don't know which one of the infinite input strings was the original one

you don't have bitcoins "on a computer", bitcoins are not discrete items that can be stored on a wallet. Balances don't exists. The "wallet" should really be called "keychain" and it allows you to sign messages on the public ledger blockchain. Each message contains how many bitcoins you moved from one of your address to another one. That's it. If you copy your keychain (wallet) on another computer, you just copied the keys, no coins are created.

In my view taxes are the transaction fee. No need for a name to collect transaction fees. In fact, every time you use the Bitcoin network you are paying a tax for the service. Don't want to pay any fee? you lose the ability to transact in Bitcoin.
So governments could collect transaction fees. A government doesn't like to compete for the fees against other miners? It can fork its own bitcoin and mine that one, asking people to use that coin (I said "ask", no "force"). Use my coin, get my public services. Don't use my coin? no services for you. Simple as that

whatever fee you choose you're safe. There's no "limbo", either the transaction get included in a block or it is not. The trade off is on the "when it get included" part. You can go for 0 fee and eventually some saint will include it just in a rush to release its next block or you can go for a reasonable amount and be pretty confident it will get included. Go for the standard "normal" fee and it should be fine. Alternatively, check the average current fee online and go for it

@_date: 2017-11-29 18:00:46
mining centralization is of course a problem but not as big as you think. Thinking the miner as the "ruler" of the Bitcoin network is a misconception. They obey the Bitcoin rules imposed by the protocol as the nodes do. No one is in charge, neither the miners nor the nodes. Nodes will accept only valid blocks and miners have incentive to produce only valid blocks, the ones that will make into the blockchain. They can start producing a different kind of blocks (thus expressing their power to change things inside the Bitcoin network) but at the risk that node will not accept them. At worst a fork will happen i.e. some nodes will start accepting the new kind of nodes. Miners put 10000s of dollars at stake every time they produce a new block, they WANT to make it into the blockchain and the nodes are the validators

I think credit cards and fiat in general will not go completely away. IMHO Bitcoin will be what Linux became: a "base layer" infrastructure no one knows about but still everyone uses \*daily\*. That's my concept of mass adoption. An exchange is basically a bank, with pros and cons, but under the hood it speaks Bitcoin. So users will have the opportunity to go solo with Bitcoin (great power and great responsibilities) or partnership with banks like we are forced to do today
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:42:46
The most compelling argument is less decentralization. I run my own Bitcoin node and I couldn't do it if the block was 100Mb in size. Very few actors would have the resources to run a 100Mb block Bitcoin node. The problem becomes immediately evident if you run your own Bitcoin node.
@_date: 2019-04-19 07:08:13
I think the main problem here is thinking that the Bitcoin mining process is a waste of energy and resources because not tied to any real world problem. The truth IMHO, is that POW keeps bad actors away from messing with the blockchain. Think about castle walls: they are extremely expensive to build, looks like a pointless effort since it's just an annoyance to go through the gates, open and close the gates, instead of just walking straight away from the castle. The reason for POW in building the walls is that it keeps bad actors away from messing with the castle itself. So in my opinion, Bitcoin mining isn't pointless at all, but instead aimed at securing the network and protecting the blockchain from arbitrary changes. Forcing the mining process to serve some other purpose is like trying to repurpose the castle walls to solve "more useful" problems
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:20:56
it's very simple: build an ethereum smart contract which reads the bitcoin price from multiple independent sources (you can use Oraclize api to do so). If the condition is met the smart contract will release the BTC to an address for which you provide the public and the private key and post them here. Once I see the public and private key of the receiving address posted here and the smart contract I described running on the Ethereum network I will trust you.
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:53:11
I see. I'm asking because I had this idea on how implement a zero knowledge custodial service. Instead of giving the private key to some third party service, one could setup a special 1-2 multisig smart contract  where the third party can't spend the funds in behalf of the original owner unless the latter stops any activity on his/her funds for N consecutive blocks. Basically a dead man switch, where the owner is "forced" to send a small amount of btc to itself (or any other address) every now and then (let's say at least 1 transaction of few satoshis every 6 months) to prevent the third party to be able to spend on his/her behalf. If the owner stops sending funds it means he/she lost the private key, and the protocol will allow (after the time as expired) the third party to spend, basically reverting the system to the current custodial approach, where the custodian is in complete control of the funds. Maybe the allowed receiving address could be locked by the smart contract itself, preventing the third party to send funds to an arbitrary address.

10$ or even 100$ long term doesn't make any sense, it would imply Bitcoin has some kind of value but just 210 millions in total. If it has value it must be a lot, if it hasn't any value it must be zero. The current price it's just a transition phase where the market is trying to "focus" the enormous value of Bitcoin as a tool for freeing humanity from oligarchs and tyrants. So to me there's no "balance in between": the right value must be either zero or the value of a world reserve currency

I'll try to explain to you what Lighting Network is:
Imagine two kings trading with each other. The kings are far away from each other. Every time they trade they have to send scouts across the dangerous wood with the correct amount of gold. Scouts demand a fee for the dangerous job. The transaction in gold is costly, dangerous and slow. The two kings then agree on locking part of their gold in a very secure vault, very distant from each other but very secure indeed! From now on they trade certificates where they simply state how much gold their owe to each other. Sending scouts with just paper certificates is faster, cheap and safe.  After many trades back and forth they decide to stop and get their gold back, depending on the current state of their final balances. This way they have transacted dozen of times but they have sent scouts with actual gold only 2 times (one to get to the vault, one to get back from the vault).
The secure vault in Lightning Network is the blockchain, a secure, trusted and impartial third party. The certificates are Lighting Network messages. The kings are the users. The scouts are the network. When you send gold the vault you are "opening a LN channel". When you are getting back your gold you are "closing the LN channel".

I'll try to explain it for you. The real trustless part in Bitcoin is the private key generation. You pick 256 random bits. It doesnt require any third party or any trust on something else. The problem is how you use such privage key: you could actually craft a transaction by pencil and paper, following the protocol and some basic math knowledge, no jokes it can be done in an evening. You are only required to trust math. For covenience you are more likely to use an app or an hardware wallet in which some level of trust is indeed required, other than just trust in math. You can still restore full trust on a third party software if you deny any connection with the outside world. If the app, pc wallet or hardware wallet can't connect, it doesnt matter if it knows your private key. Just copy the encoded transaction it creates and relay it to the outside network.

What a joke, a government issued cryptocurrency is just fiat in digital form. If they were to create a truly decentralized new crypto they wouldn't have control over it. Allegedly Petro is backed by oil so they control the coin creation process which means they can "print" more coin than the actual oil would allow ( = fiat). A true cryptocurrency is not owned by anyone and the creator either is dead or he/she/it doesn't have any interest in exploiting his/her/its creation

I also noticed that we are in a concurrent triangle compressing pattern which happened just before a double head and shoulder scenario. This give me confidence in saying that the bearish bullrun may or may not acquire momentum thus increasing or decreasing the price index in a formal quadratic function which is in a direct correlation to the diverted logarithmic price increase experienced in 2013. So basically the price may or may not change in the near term future. Got it?

let's clarify: invalid addresses are addresses without a valid checksum and for that a solution already exists (i.e. the wallet would not allow you to send money to them). I suspect you misunderstand what an invalid address is. You are not allow to know what's the private key given a public key so "burn addressees" are just addresses for which there is no known corresponding private key
Anyway, bitcoins sent to burn addresses are a gift to the community. The locked bitcoins make the remaining ones slightly more valuable :-)

Bitcoin allows people to choose when and how much give money to whom. This allows for a healthy competition over governments for which one has got the most fair taxation system and best services. No more lies and f*cking around, pure honest competition. You are greedy and inefficient? GTFO, you are good and fair? PROSPER!

1. it's around 7 tps
2. the point of proof of work is that it has to be a deliberately hard computation, harder than the majority of the power around can deal with. If it's easy it's not secure. The difficulty creates a financial incentive to act good (for miners) and it prevents people from changing the data stored in the blockchain. An "easy proof of work" is pointless. It's like saying that a castle should have easy to build walls, because it's cheaper, faster and eco friendly for the surroundings because you use less resources to build them. The point of walls on a castle is to prevent people from getting in, so they have to be diffcult and expensive to build in order to secure the castle. The taller and hard to build walls, the better.

My reasoning is that by adhering to blockchain A people will tie their wealth to that blockchain, getting all the benefits and being subject to all its rules (of course). Blockchain could punish someone by nullifying his/her wealth instantaneously or redistributing it across all the other people or by taking a cut. Geographical location is an issue, yes, for example public roads. I sense IoT is going to save the day on that issue, but I'm not sure. Healthcare seems fine: you get paid X by your blockchain and you can spend this X only on healthcare. Law/justice? I think that one still requires people to work properly

please remind me! set the remind me here on reddit. My point is: it will dip to the greatest point of discomfort which is around 5K-6K then it will start to raise again. Why 5K-6K? I'll show you:
* If it goes &lt;1K I would buy the sh*t out of it, no question asked. I actually "kind of hope" for this to occur
* If it goes 2K-ish I would buy but less convinced
* If it goes 3K-4K I would buy again but a little bit annoyed about the massive crash
* In the 5K-6K I'm in the worst situation, not quite low to buy and annoyed from the massive crash
* In the 7K-8K I would not buy, slightly annoyed about the crash but life goes on
* 9K-10K range still happy
* &gt;10K fine
So, as you can see, the range we really don't like is around 5K-6K. By market forces, that's exactly what's going to happen as everything below there are people willing to buy a lot, everything higher people are willing to sell.  5K-6K is the level of greatest discomfort, prepare for it.

bitcoin can be exchange directly for goods and services, no need to convert back to fiat. You can earn bitcoin from labor, no need to earn fiat. Governments don't have control over Bitcoin, they can ban by creating some laws that have to be "adopted" by people. Exchanges can be close, Bisq (a decentralized exchange) can't be closed unless they completely close and ban normal wire transfers. Banning and blocking are two very different concepts. They can "ban" but not "block", some people fail to understand this difference. The only way to block Bitcoin would be to destroy and close the internet itself.

Very good but I see two problems here:
- the seed should be shown in the built-in display.. having it displayed on the smartphone is a massive security hole. The smartphone knows the private key and that's a big no-no for an HW. I guess this wallet would be used just for small amounts
- the wallet should show the destination address when confirming the transaction, not just the amount. I can see a couple of scenario where this could be exploited to steal some funds

this time is different, if it gets around 2000 I'll buy the shit out of it, and many other people will do the same, it's not like I'm the smartest guy in town... volatility in percentage drops over time albeit volatilty in absolute value increases. So there may be a bearish dip but not so big as the one in 2013. The ship is getting bigger and bigger and it takes quite a lot more effort to swing it.

I think potentially we are headed to $2000-$3000 levels. We are told that past behaviour is not the best predictor but I understand that people's mind is still the same, that's what ultimately drives the market. 
So, here's why:
 * 2009-2011: Bitcoin 1$-ish, spike to $20 then dip to $2 
 * 2011-2013: Bitcoin 10$-ish spike to almost $200 then dip to $70
 * 2013-2013: Bitcoin 100$-ish spike to $1000 then dip to $200
 * 2013-2017 Bitcoin 1000$-ish,10000$-ish spike to almost $20000....
It is like Bitcoin is "testing" the next order of magnitude price by crossing it, doubling and then dipping to 70-80%. Rinse and repeat
so now a dip to $2000 is fully possible. Of course the next stop will be a $100000 Bitcoin so I'm quite happy right now :-)

I think they are afraid of people's reviews  saying "using this wallet my transactions take ages to confirm or never get confirmed, I do not recommend mycelium".

Taxes exist because we delegate a central authority to collect them and spend these funds (hopefully) for public services. Blockchain is going to replace this mechanism: governments run by humans will be no longer. People will "vote" laws and rules to apply to the blockchain by means of shared consensus, people who disagree will fork themself out as a different government. The blockchain itself will collect funds to pay companies for public services, by means of those protocol rules. No one to bribe, no people to corrupt. Just a blockchain running the ecosystem and redistributing wealth in the most fair and most honest way possible. People themselves decide those rules by shared consensus and people who dont agree dont get the benefit

You completely missed the point of "voting". We'll vote like we voted for Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash: by adopting one or the other blockchain. People will come up with a soft/hard fork and implement the change, shared consensus will establish the new code. Who doesn't like it will fork himself out on a different blockchain "legislation".
Unfortunately government tied to a location doesn't work over blockchain, true. Internet itself is beyond national borders... companies are constantly exploiting this fact, juggling data and money back and forth "across borders" making local governments laws (based on geographical location) totally uneffective. It doesn't make any sense to forbid moving bitcoins across national borders.

When someone pays you 20 bucks do you check and re-check the banknote, call the federal reserve and ask what features to look for and what they should look like on a genuine banknote? Same applies for Bitcoin: to carry a massive 51% double spend attack you need so much computational power, so much money that doing it for a taxi ride is ridiculous (and not worthwhile). P.S. did you know that DIY checking a banknote (as most people do) is pointless if you do not know exactly what a genuine banknote should look like (features, contrast, texture, ink, holograms, watermarks etc..)?

probably it's not going to $1000, too many people would like to buy a lot at that price thus defeating the possibility that Bitcoin would reach that price in the first place. I think a more "uncomfortable" level of $4000-$5000 is more probable, a level which has a nice balance between: 
* not so many people are willing to buy a lot at the $4000-$5000 range
* not so many people are willing to sell a lot at the $4000-$5000 range

@_date: 2018-02-15 13:43:29
A cryptocurrency that becomes widely adopted and accepted especially by institutions in finance/commercial/government would not be decentralized nor permissionless thus would not be embraced by people. Bitcoin doesn't rely on government support in order to survive, quite the opposite. The more they fight it, the more they lock themselves out of the new system
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:37:29
I recommend doing a recovery test. Setup the wallet, take note of the seed, send a small amount of money into it, wipe out the wallet pretending to be brand new and then restore from the seed. I always do it before sending the whole lot, it will give you great peace of mind. Horror stories about people not being able to restore due to a wrong seed transcription are real 
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:36:29
Limiting the size of the block creates scarcity and competition for transactions to be included into a block. This in turns create a trasaction fee market. Trasaction fees keep spammers away and creates incentive for a miner to mine a block, especially when the reward will be negligible. Thus a block has to be limited in space (1mb) and in time (PoW), remove any of those conditions and Bitcoin stop working
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:01:29

a collective agreement over all governments is not possible... they can't even agree on a much smaller scale (see EU). I think a total ban will cause an underlying black market where bitcoins are exchange for good and services without ever resorting to fiat at any stage (see prohibitionism in the US, 1920 circa). As an example why greed overpower agreement over governments: China banned ICOs but not Bitcoin itself because it's very profitable

it is not possible to plain reverse an hash because for every hash value there are an infinite number of messages hashing to that hash value. Proof: there are an infinite number of inputs. There are "only" 2^256 possible hashes. Now divide the number of possible inputs by 2^256 and you get the number of inputs hashing to a given hash value. What you can do is to find a collision which means finding one of the infinite inputs that make into that hash value

because maybe 2 mb is fine but soon you'll need 4 mb then 8,16, 32 etc... to scale as Visa you'll need a GB block. This means 99% of the nodes will not have the required bandwidth / storage to run. Less and less nodes will be able to run the Bitcoin network, only few big nodes =&gt; CENTRALIZATION. Few big players are easier to bribe or corrupt, 51% attack would be much easier. Please don't misunderstand, I'm talking about Bitcoin nodes, not miners. Mining can and currently is mostly centralised but they do not control the network, they have to do what nodes require them to do, punishment for mining a block with ad-hoc data is block rejection (performed by the nodes) which means hundreds of thousand dollars lost for nothing
In the past we stopped transacting gold back and forth between people because it was slow, risky, expensive, inefficient and didn't scale. Instead of widening the roads and use bigger and more powerful horses, we then decide to lock suck gold in a trusted location and instead we started transacting ownership certificates. Those certificates could be exchanged back and forth much more frequently, more efficiently and cheaper: when we had enough we could redeem the actual gold based on the current status of the certificates. To me, it looks like the Lightning Network :-)
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:18:41
The real innovation will come from lighting network where the translator will get paid immediately for every translated sentence. This fluid payment method will allow 1) the customer to eliminate any risk, just pay for the first word, maybe a 1 cent risk. 2) the translator will get paid immediately and he/she will keep translating as long as the "money stream" comes in. This applies to utility companies like electricity, water and such. Zero risks for both parties, pay as long as you use, stop delivering the service as soon the customer stops the stream of money. No more "you first" type of dead lock we have today. No more "will the work be any good?" problem

There's no such thing as a "stuck" transaction in Bitcoin. Either your transaction is included in a block or it is not. Since your transaction hasn't been included yet it's like it didn't happen in the first place, so you can just wait a little bit longer and see what happen or perform the same transaction from a different wallet (which doesn't know about the "stuck" one. Your current wallet will refuse to proceed further as it sees a pending transaction, but from the perspective of any other wallet, the transaction hasn't been made at all). 23 sat/bytes are enough, just wait. Even 0 sat/byte transactions get included eventually. Do not worry

OP here, it's a Raspberry Pi model B running a Bitcoin node. I compiled myself the code (2+ hours process on the very same Raspberry Pi), got a spare 500GB USB hard drive to store the blockchain. This Bitcoin node is now part of the peer to peer Bitcoin network and it helps decentralizing the network (the more nodes out there the better).
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:38:30
It's a rp3 model B. I synced the blockchain on my PC and then passed the external USB hard drive to the rp3

Because it's a "reality check" moment for them, they have to send you real bitcoins instead of keeping update their MySQL database with fairy tales recorded onto it. When you buy from coinbase you dont really know if they allocate real bitcoins for you or they just update their database (probably the latter). So when the price of bitcoin skyorckets they throw in a lot of excuses like KYC, congestions, regulation etc.. just to make you wait a little bit, hoping the price will get down

Meaning that in order to understand an answer we first need to understand the question we are asking. "Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme" is not backed by any substantial evidence or facts. "The earth is flat! now prove the contrary to me!" No amount of knowledge can change the mind of someone telling you "the earth is flat because it is so".

Online crypto trading doesn't require to interact with the blockchain at all!  It's all MySQL queries and fiat fairy tales, until of course you decide to withdraw your coins to an address you control

I decided to setup this Bitcoin node for two reasons basically:
\- I don't need to trust anymore [Blockchain.info]( or any other third party api/websites about the current state of my transactions, balances, etc... Even my hardware wallets doesn't need to.
\- I help keeping the Bitcoin network decentralized

I do. Massive bullish signal. It reminds me of Nov 2017.
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:01:09
no, this is just a full node. I compiled the source code on the very same raspberry pi (it took 2 hours to complete) and now I don't even have to trust [blockchain.info]( to see my balance ahah

What address are you talking about? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:20:44
You are confusing total supply with rate of mining. Gold supply is finite and pre determined, no one can change that, although we can  increase the  mining rate by luck (finding a new mines) or by technology (new mining tech) 
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:33:45
it is a full node. The storage you see it's the SD card. Swap is off. Blocks are stored on the external 500GB USB hard drive 
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:17:06
You are the ignorant, short sighted person that couldn't possibily run a business of any sort.  Of course it is their problem because we are discussing their behavior here on Reddit and they just lost one potential customer (which is me).

A Bitcoin full node made out of a raspberry pi and a cheap 500gb USB hard drive

I see logistic function when plotting on a log scale. That's a good thing because many technologies and innovations  follow the same rule for their adoption. Bitcoin is no exception
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:49:33
I did it because Bitcoin gave me a lot of knowledge and now I'm giving back somthing :-)
Also, securing the Bitcoin network is for yourself really, it's a reward in its own right
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:21:19
Probably because there are more exchanges outside the US? But anyway, even the exchange employees  are incapable of convincing the hot wallet to sign a vanilla transaction instead of a time locked one

Uhm, the .com reminds me of a commercial website. I can't stop thinking about an ICO. The proposal is clearly not a scam but the .com domain is really cringy to me in some weird way. I associate it with commercial stuff. I'd prefer a .org 
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:02:25
Thank you for the advice. How can I do it? Once my PC is fully synced up, can I just brutally copy the files on the raspberry USB external drive? Any other files to remove/update?
@_date: 2018-12-23 17:16:26
I enabled on disk swap file on the USB hard drive. Slower than RAM swap file but it's not going to run out ;-)

@_date: 2018-12-23 16:24:43
Correct. Not mining here, just helping the Bitcoin network to stay decentralised by running a peer node. Validating blocks so those miners can't cheat on us and achieving zero third party trust in the process
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:36:55
exactly right!. Like people who smoke usually tell me: "oh you've been so lucky to not start smoking when you were 17yo!" I usually reply: "Dude, I've been saying "no" for a good 10 years  to all of you trying to convince me to start smoking because it's cool!". Now those people are trying to rationalize their mistake by off-loading their responsibilities to an non-existent agent called fate.

Blockchain is currently 200 gb so data usage will be approx 200gb. On a monthly basis you need to  uderstand that a 1mb block is produced every 10 minutes.

There are now N+1 Bitcoin peer nodes, not just N :-)
Bitcoin network is now a little bit more censorship resistant and a little bit more decentralised.
Nodes are in charge of validating blocks produced by miners and to route transactions across the network
That's my reward really
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:15:00
That's the SD card. The blocks are stored on an external hard drive

It doesn't matter how the hot wallet is connected. It could be connected via ethernet cable or via usb sticks attached to pigeons. If it's automatically triggered by the end user then it's automatically triggered by the hacker

prove me wrong please. Your car infotainment system and your smart thermostat are running Linux right now... Your home router, broadband companies equipments and almost any serious server out there run Linux or one of its derivative. Your reply to this very comment touches hundreds of Linux systems before arriving to my screen. Please do not think of Linux as a Fedora/Ubuntu distro you install on your PC... Linux is the 1st choice in embedded solutions almost everywhere
