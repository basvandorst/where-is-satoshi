 Venezuela has been starving with skyrocketing inflation since 2009 
Yet the first economic sanctions were imposed in 2017 - 
 Do you actually think the sanctions **went back in time?**
This question tends to cause heads to explode, so we understand if you cant respond.

Globalresearch used Telesur as it's only source that the Obama sanctions destroyed Venezuela. Telesur is Venezuelan state news media. 
the 2015 sanctions only applied to SEVEN INDIVIDUALS, and there names are listed here, along with the actual language of the sanctions. - 
The sanctions froze the SEVEN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES PERSONAL US BANK ACCOUNTS. Do you think these INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES had so much money in their PERSONAL US BANK ACCOUNTS, that the entire economy of Venezuela collapsed when it was frozen?
Why do these questions frighten you so much?

**Who do you think increased Venezuela's money supply by 100,000%**
C'mon now. Dont be scared. This is the same paralyzing fear that traps millions in their mom's basement. If you are afraid to answer this, then leaving the basement is impossible.

The inflation was caused by rapid money creation, which began as soon as Chavez was elected. The money supply increased by 8,000% during Chavez's tenure. 


Key word is collapsed.

Yea, because the dollar is not undergoing hyperinflation. During times of hyperinflation, people begin using stable currencies.
**Who do you think increased Venezuela's money supply by 100,000%?**
Don't be afraid to answer. It won't hurt, I promise.

Answer the question. Be brave. There is a light at the top of the basement.

So you think the USA "hacked" Venezuela's currency printer, increasing their money supply by 100,000%? 
And you think Venezuela's leaders never bothered to unplug the printer?

Every other currency in the world experiences the same or higher rates of inflation. 
The US did not cause Venezuela's hyperinflation.

**How did the USA destroy their currency?**
Did the USA hypnotize Chavez and make him increase their money supply by 100,000%?
Or was it an inflation attack satellite laser fired from space?
Why do you insist on keeping it a secret?

It's just a coincidence that all socialist economies collapse?
Bad luck, maybe?

You think the USA "hacked" venezuela's currency printer, increased their money supply by 100,000%, causing the world's highest hyperinflation? 
Don't be scared to answer. Conquer your fear.

Venezuela was starving in 2012, when oil prices were over $100/bbl. 
Do you remember that time every OPEC country collapsed when oil prices fell?
Yea, me neither.

I would consider the country with the worst economy in the world as collapsed. I would consider the country with the highest hyperinflation in the world as collapsed. I would consider the country caused the worst refugee crisis in the western hemisphere as collapsed.
You can pretend Venezuela is just as good as Russia, but it's not.
