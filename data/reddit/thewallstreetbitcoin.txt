Banks are pretty much done with fee-based services when cryptocurrencies gain popularity. Digital currency is, even more, cost-effective for the United States government. AI has taken over banking. Without the 5% they charge on everything debited/credited that takes a card, the banks suddenly find themselves in a huge bubble.

Bank of America started putting holds on my check deposits after I started transferring money to Coinbase.

I'm still HODLing on some Bitcoin, sold some profits, bought back in a little high, but $8,000 makes me feel better. Still have some original Bitcoin investment too. Can't wait for $10,000. What is everyone else's exit point?
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:08:26
$10,000 before the end of 2017 looks a lot more realistic now, that's for sure. CME Group coming on in December and Square Cash app allowing buying and selling of Bitcoin will only drive that pull more.

You really think it's that low? I'm thinking today sell off, then they'll try to get there money back again before the end of the year.

Do you think the Wall Street guys will be unloading cash into Bitcoin to try to get out of the tax implications for this year?

The alts are gaining good. I think we are looking at $8200 at the end of the year, then a run to $25,000 maybe by the end of 2018. People want Bitcoin to trade the other coins.

Your saying Bitcoin is expensive, yet your not looking at the market as a whole. It's not just about financial transactions, it's about encryption and giving people their privacy back on the internet. Bitcoin is just the engine that powers all these other little companies because that's all the exchange's ways of getting trading fees, by making you trade through Bitcoin or Ethereum. Your looking at one tiny small function of distributed ledger technology and one of the oldest and most expensive in Bitcoin.

I actually think this is where blockchain is taking us it more towards credit unions. I think blockchains will be more localized as well. Banks will soon no longer be able to justify there outrageous salaries and fees.  Bitcoin kind of eliminates the need for bankers.

Why does a rich person need a bank to lend their money and let the bank make all the profit off them and charge them fees for holding their money. You see banks don't use their own money, they should be paying us.

I think the early investors are taking their profits and getting prepared for CME Group to start allowing futures trading of Bitcoin. Everything is traded through Bitcoin or Ether right now, and I think we are about to see a lot more capitalization of the cryptocurrency market as a whole because of it. There's a lot more capital to come in this market yet.

To make profit you have to sell some off. Getting it back at a good price when it's on a run can be hard, especially when there is a bubble forming. I guess we are all waiting to see if this was Bitcoin's bubble popping with the SegWit2x debacle or not. I would buy it while it's down if it were me.

It's the big time investors getting ready to squeeze in. CME Group managaes over 4 quadrillion dollars. That's right, $4 QUADRILLION. The fat cats are making it cheap to buy in at, and run it up again.

For all you who think banks have money to lend, they don't. 2008 happened because they don't have the money that they're lending. They live on a 3 or 4 day window of floating money around for customers for a fee. Who needs that anymore. Smart contracts, blockchain, even apps. The banks have to cut back on their spending or their doomed. It's happened every 20 years since the Federal Reserve opened and started lending money to banks. Derivatives are a bunch of garbage. Banks make their money on fees, interest is a fee. How many times do you have to watch it play out? I just know classroom economics isn't the kind of math banks use. They make up there own math if they are ponzi'ing off a little to get the books right. You'd be surprised how little money the banks really do control themselves.

I think it's going to be the biggest redistribution of wealth in a long time. I appreciate the insight on the thread.

An exit point is where you have decided you have enough profit and you sell off your initial investment worth or more, depending on your exit strategy. Most people play Bitcoin like a stock. You should research some of these key finance terms and you will be ahead of the pack in college.

Bitcoin will have a correction sooner or later, but the markets are forming themselves. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be looked at as commodities, that's why I think CME Group is getting in so early. Bitcoin will be a gold standard, especially now with all the successful forks of the blockchain. The investment bankers can't scheme the system because it's hard written into the programming code of bitcoin and all these forks. I think Bitcoin does away with traditional banking as we know it today. That's just my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:38:11
Totally agree, and feel your pain to a lesser degree. I try to buy a lower priced Ether or LiteCoin with my fiat currency if I'm going to go trade. I'm holding my Bitcoin from now on too. Great post.

1 second during the Super Bowl is $167,000 and a low-cost payment system like Bitcoin is a bubble at $9,000. This is what all the experts on TV tell you. It's almost like a coordinated effort to brainwash everyday people out of making solid investments.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:13:43
Does anybody think the CME Group announcement and Goldman Sachs being strong on Bitcoin had anything to do with them calling the fork off? I mean clearly they were going to kill the run they've had as far as price is concerned. Everyone is acting like the miners don't like the money to simply because they're making money the decentralized way. Bitcoin is flat right now the day after the announcement and everything else is up 10% or more on average. I think blockchain technology got some good publicity out of this either way.

2nd inning for sure. The botch of SegWit2x was a double play because it split the community.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:51:13
It's down $1,000. Order books look like a big sell off. I think big investors are buying BitcoinCash and trying to make it fork again.

We want good conversation on the topics, and to introduce more people to blockchain technology.

When mainstream media picks up on it, the price of Bitcoin will soar. Nice article. Good to see the BBC News organization knows a little bit about the blockchain technology behind BTC.

Visa has always had the problem of the double spend, that's the problem that the Bitcoin P2P payment solves, and this is what is adding value to it at the current time being. Visa can't turn down a billion dollars in payment processing or be scorn by investors, yet they are having to let people buy stock in their competitors. It's going to be interesting to see what the end result of this is.
