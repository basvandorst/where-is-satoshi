 You're wrong, its people trying to bring Bitcoin to people who normally wouldn't go out of there way to read about it or hear about it. Never mind making a coinbase purchase.  Then these people realize they have to be compliant with regulations written by the people in control of the banking system and it costs 50 thousand just to get a license to operate one.  Never mind all the other expenses.  Ill pay the 7%

I got pretty deep into the process of opening one. The U.S. law is completely ridiculous and is written by the people controlling the banking system to aid them in maintaining that control. 
The real money laundering goes on from behind the doors of the big banks. They launder 70billion get fined 15 billion and walk away with 55 billion profit. While people trying to spread an awesome technology like Bitcoin have to deal with this.. absurd.
