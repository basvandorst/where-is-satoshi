@_date: 2017-01-31 06:35:08
lol, Bitcoin does this, goes up a lot, falls down quite a bit, then goes up some and trades in a tight range till it decides to go up or down again.

u need private key to do that. So U have to download the blockchain to get the key.  
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:40:48
oh damn Son, Coinbase , Hmmm, could be bad. AFOM got a letter from SSI when he sold stocks.

@_date: 2017-01-14 21:02:18
Yep, Coinbase works in US. I also sent u more options
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:37:37
GBTC has been trading for years, silly goose 
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:05:12
Gone, for ever... This one reason we r not at 1 Million per coin.
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:13:51
That is how the fees work, lots more transactions will be put in the block, that is how bitcoin moves. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 08:06:27

Bitcoin Satellites should be going up in space. They will also mine in space. In case something happens down here it will be all safe. Anyone will be able to connect to the bitcoin sats with a satellite dish.
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:34:59
