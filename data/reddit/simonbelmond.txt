We know that feeling. It will get a little bit better over time. Specially consider two advises:
1. If you can afford to buy more without it being bad for your family's life, just buy, but don't tell your wife every day. If you can't afford, stop now!
2. Talk to people about it, but stop if you feel they have an aversion or are not interested. Safe your energy for those who are interested, because there are many. Otherwise people think you are crazy (we know you are only a little bit). Just imagine someone telling you all day about cartography, the science of it, the political importance, how the world would not be where it is today, yadda, yadda ,yada. Or worse about how they collect this and that and that it is the next big thing...

I run a node 24/7 in my basement and it scores under the first 1000 nodes in score. I have no bandwidth or disk size issues if block size increases. My node is ready for the increase shall it come.

google for bitcoin graffitti or something. Lets you embed asci images.
There are about 15 timestamping services. I made a list once. you can find it in my post history. or search r/bitcoin for timestamping list or overview.
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:34:28
I have no connection to them other than having used the service for the first time some minutes ago. Needed to send a fax to PayPal (yes, I know) for some account verification details. they only allow 10mb of .pdf uploads, so I chose the fax route. Thanks for making it easier for us to deal with certain companies that still rely on fax.

you can use one of many mining calculators e.g. the one from Genesisblock. Assuming a given total hashrate its easy to calculate by hand as well. However, the difficult part is figuring out what the rate will be in say 3 month from now.
If you want to mine for profit, buy and hold btc is the much better option. at least this is very likely. You can sometimes also mine altcoins which are more profitable and then sell for BTC. There are also sites telling you which one is the most profitable ones for the algo you can mine. I think there are even pool which hop. Also check out the mining subreddit
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:03:26
Go on, do it! If you have enough people who think like you and you have a consensus on the architecture of the protocol you might grow bigger then Bitcoin. However, beware that lot's of people will feel the same as you do now five years from now. They will think it is unfair that you have many coins and they don't. O and there are about 350 altcoins already, so maybe consider hopping on one which exists. Good luck!

Would it be feasible to create an opreturn email plugin which could submit a hash of every email I send to the BC?
How long can the string be in opreturn?
Would it be feasible that such a plugin gathers hashes of several emails (yours and others) to submit it at once to save fees?
Would the BC bloat be a problem (in adition to the "normal" bloat problem) if a lot of people would use this?
Sorry for all these questions but I just had a case yesterday where I would have loved to have this.

@_date: 2014-10-19 11:02:26
I would like to have a mechanical hashing/eliptic curve machine (in my imagination it looks like an Enigma). I could then use dice ore something similar to generate a private key. Then the Enigma could be sed to generate public key and address. So you could truly crate bitcoin keypairs without a computer at all. Does anyone know if it would be possible to build this mechancally?
For reference:
Edit: I guess it would be difficult...

You decide the grade of transparency regarding two things:
1. Whom you show addresses with Bitcoins on them. The Bitcoins are actually called unspent transaction outputs and could be compared to unspent amazon vouchers. Amazon can make you 2x50 out of a 100. You cannot cut it in half for yourself. The block chain gives you your change back. You can have as many addresses as you like. An Email address is something you need to receive emails and send some, same applies to Bitcoin. Receive and send. You will never be able to send more than you receive, with Bitcoin.
2. How you create transactions exactly and spend your funds. Of course you don't want anyone to see your savings account, every time you pay for a coffee. New wallets with BIP 32, 39 and 44 enable a one time backup, for basically as many accounts as you like. An account again has for practical purposes infinite amount of addresses. New wallets also never receive change back onto the same address by default. So pretty decent default privacy.

First of all thanks for answering and specially for providing this cool open source tool: I first tried it unconfirmed where I had to abort the import as it never finished.

I have seen it in the theater and I hope that the community can stop naging about not releasing it earlier or not it the way it is supposed in the open source community. We are for freedom after all and if these guys want to do it that way, it's their decision.
The kind of people they reached during the film festival are not the people that hang out on this sub or on bitcoin talk. Group of girls, father and daughter, mid 50 housewife groups... Some of these people had no idea before they went to the theater.  Some really had their mind blown. I could tell from the discussions afterwards.
They don't mind if the newest sequence of the film is 6 month old. The end was very well done, by the way. The Bitcoin intro in the beginning had the right level of detail for mainstream. It explained all the what, without digging into the how.
Just wanted to say this as there was a lot of bad sentiment against the distribution of the movie on this sub. In my city it will now screen in normal cinemas for a while which is great.

So with this spiral, why would anyone ever buy a computer ever? Because they need one now.
Economists want growth, growth and more growth doesn't matter if quantitative or qualitative growth. This is why we should not save but spend. Even if we don't have the money. Growth at all cost because we have to pay yesterdays debt. And our children will pay tomorrows debt (if monetary inflation is fast enough it doesn't matter as the debt will be small enough vale or purchasing power wise).
Guess what? I am even playing that game myself. Mortage...

So even if your tx is not yet fixed in a block you get a certain liklyhood back that someone can publish another tx using the same outputs and it would successfully propagate and be included n the next block instead of yours.

The instructions which come with the device is like 3 lines long and that's all you need. A wizard walks you through the rest... Everything easy going... However, I was impressed a lot by the advanced options.
Regarding paper wallets: I am not sure this exists but M/N encrypted wallets would be cool. So it is printer safe. I would write the pw directly on the pieces. Encryptd paper wallets only serv that for me. They are pri ter safe. Write the pw on them directly. Otherwise I would not feel confortable about inheritance. Kind of like a small Armory M/N printer safe wallet. Of course these can not be sweept as easily as normal ones. At least not yet. I know bitaddress has M/N, but I don't think encrypted...

This is an excellent questions and I hope you get many answers to it. here some of mine:
* Remember when Sony lost millions of credit card details? Remember the implications? This can never happen with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a push system (like cash), where CCs are a pull system. Anyone knowing your details can just drain from it.
* Let's say you want to subscribe to a service but it puts you off because these bloody subscription have to be cancled at the right time, otherwise you are going to pay for another year. This will not happen to you with Bitcoin.
* What about splitting a bill after a restaurant visit. Why fumble with coins and such. there will even be apps just for that if you like. Someone forgot to pay their share? No prob as he can send bitcoins from the bus he is sitting on. Doing ebanking for these 20$ is just a pain.
* Credit cards and cash arn't really an investment. Bitcoin can be if you like it to be. NY just declared it a intangible property.
* What about multi-signature accounts? My bank doesn't offer them to me as a private person.
* Bitcoin is censorship resistant. Some like that feature, some don't. Same is true for e.g. blogging on the internet. There are sure people who would like some bloggs to disappear. No more arab spring and such. However, I think people should be able to voice their thoughts.
* Remember how it was to communicate with Australia 25 years ago in writing. How long did it take to send a photo, write back, another letter back. Why should we not apply these principles to money (edit I mean the principles of email)?
* Bitcoin is open source, predictable and ruled by mathematics. I don't think this is true for fiat money. If you are interested in transparency the current economical and finacial system I recommend you to start here: [Confession of an economic hitman]( [Secrets of money 4](
* Bitcoin is open-source and completely voluntary. After checking out [how it works under the hood]( judge if you like it or not. You will never be forced to use it though.
Thanks for checking out Bitcoin. If these points and many others people are going to present do not convince you, feel free to step away.
But be aware, I have not even started to write about the truly advanced stuff you can do with blockchain-technology...

You only synch the addresses generated from a generic seed which derives from your full seed. Addresses contain the balances. The keys are needed to move them.
A signature is not a key. A signature is something which proves you own the key to a certain address. A transaction is basically broadcasting a signed wish to transact. This signed wish does not contain information which gives away the key. It can not be reused like a hand written signature as is signs a specific message. To spend Bitcoin from an address, you need to only expose the signed message to the Bitcoin network.
The general idea with cold storage is to keep the private key (i.e. seedkey) as protected as possible. The transmissions hall be as save as possible. Armory e.g. is planing to do audion cable connection between two machines. If you are ultra paranoid you could write down a unsigned transaction by hand and type it on the offline system and vice versa.
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:10:58
Yes and No. If you use it from your Windows machine while on the net, and stuff no. If you take this site offline, to a computer which will never touch the internet ever again and then do it, probably yes (alpha stage). You could probably test the wallet, (spend from it or sign message), before seriously using it. Inspect the code for more security... Use a safe pringer, which either has no memory or at least isn't on a network.
Edit: Please do not take the seed or private key to an online machine. From then on it would no longer be considered cold storage. You have to sign the message on the offline machine and only take the message. Verify on online machine.

Don't. Just tell them you like Bitcoin and answer questions if they have any. Anything else will be seen as you wanting to pump your ponzi. Ironically some of them will likeley get back to you in 2-3 years and ask you why you didn't stress the point more back in the days when it was still worth to invest. (happened to me at 70 USD). We don't want the sole speculators. We want thouse who see the true value of Bitcoin. Once they see it, they will invest themselves anyway.

However, it is far better and fairer money than government currencies.
And if you don't agree with this statement you can create your own fair money and base it on the Bitcoin technology wich is blockchain technology. It enables to create an almost forgery proof sequence of events, which basically enables digital money (and other consensus) without one entity but a mass to decide if a voucher or value token is spent or not. Compare it to e.g. Amazon gift cards.

Nodes are very important. They are the first layer of security for the Bitcoin network. They decide which transactions and blocks are valid and if they are valid forward them to others.
Miners are the second layer of security ensuring timestamping of transactions if you want to say so.

Maybe think of it like an Open-ID if you want it to be one. However, you can have as many open or non-open IDs as you want. These IDs would be called addresses and are a crystallographic public key. Any of your wallets (you own two so far) can control as many addresses as you wish. Only you decide which ones you are going to make public. The privacy or transparency can be set by your behavior.

I recently had a discussion about PPCoin/proof of stake with a Bitcoin core dev. This has helped me to understand why proof of stake it is not safe.
With proof of stake you have nothing to lose. You can easily mine on two forked chains. With proof of work you have to choose a chain. This is also why the dev thought that merged mining coins are not safe. You can easily try to e.g. do illicit mining on the Namecoin chain while you are not going to lose anything on the Bitcoin chain
Currently proof of work is what really does the trick as it incentivises honest mining as you risk to lose all the profit from your work if you worked on the wrong chain.
Maybe proof of sacrifice would work? Seems very similar to proof of work only that you sacrifice coins instead of HW cost and electricity.
Hope I kind of made myself clear.

Printer safe version. Similar to Armory paper backups. A paper wallet that let's you e.g. add a short code or some dots on a qr code in order to make it work. also make sure they can be tested without any data being written onto HD. May need some more thoughts. It's just a real pain to print offline all the time and worry about printer memory and stuff. Don't know if BIP38 kind of does the job already. I never had use for a paper wallet that needs a PW. I want to hand out tips and so on. Maybe if a new Short PW was chosen randomly which can be transferred onto the paper.

I will do a Bitcoin 101 Seminar tomorrow for about 10 people. I have put together a presentation and i am really trying to tell a story and close the circle. Took me about 20h to put everything together. It will be very interactive with hands on, paper wallets... I will first ask the participants what their expectations are and what they already know.
Is there a central place such presentations are collected? I put mine together all by myself as the mastery is always to condense a field of expertise so you can explane it to others. I am happy to share the presentation and be inspired by others.

My bank only covers losses under federal guarantee up to 100k :-( We had a huge bail-out after the crisis 2008. The governent has already stated that this will not be the way forward. So only bail-ins in the future.
I strongly encurage to research the risk involved. I think the volatility is no so much an isse. However buys Bitcoin probably knows very well about it. The technical risks are fare more interessting. I encurage you to maybe start with the risk assessment done by the bitcoin foundation. It covers many technical and social risks. I do not personally agree with all the ratings there but it for sure lists many real risks.
I was answering OPs question regarding adavantages, because that's what he asked for. I do not neglect disadvanteges at all... Everybody should do their own due-dilligence...

Please share after you are done...
I have just put together a small collection of things and I am sure I forgot tons. I was asked to provide some examples yesterday for a journalist who gives guided tours at the Bitcoin Exhibition in the Zurich MoneyMuseum, so I put something together. It's in German but I guess the people here will understand anyway:
Der momentan vorherrschende Gebrauch ist als Geld/Tauschmittel. Bevor ich auf andere Anwendungen komme, möchte ich erste in paar Beispiele nennen, die alleine der Geld/Tauschmittel Aspekt schon ermöglicht, durch die speziellen Eigenschaften, die Bitcoin ausmachen.
* Zahlen von Trinkgeldern auf Plattformen wie Youtube, Google+, Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, WordPress usw.
  * vorhanden, 
* Messenger Apps, die wie WhatsApp sind, nur dass ich mit meinen Kollegen ganz einfach mal Geld überweisen kann, direkt im App.
  * Beta-Stadium vorhanden, 
* Dezentralisierte Marktplätze, die nur dank Bitcoin möglich werden. Eine art open-source ebay.
  * Beta-Stadium vorhanden, 
* Drittanbieter von Services/Wallets usw. können öffentlich mathematisch beweisen, dass beim Bitcoin Balance Sheet alles stimmt. Auf der fiat Seite ist das natürlich schwieriger.
  * mehrfach vorhanden, z.B. 
* Gambling, mathematisch fair, open-source. Auch p2p möglich. Ich könnte z.B. an Lotterien teilnehmen, wo ich weiss, dass der Erwartungswert bei 99% liegt. Im Vergleich mit Swisslos oder Casino. Die Over-Head-Kosten sind natürlich auch anders im Internet.
  * vorhanden, 
* Direkte Zahlungen
  * vorhanden, link erübrigt sich
* p2p Lending, Kredite
  * vorhanden, 
* Günstige Geldsendungen
  * Ich meine damit, dass jemand am Bestimmungsort Landeswährung erhält. In gewisse Länder gehts bereits sehr gut (z.B. Philippinen), in andere noch nicht. Mit gut ist natürlich insbesondere die Gebührensituation gemeint. Es muss deutlich besser als WesterUnion sein, damit es gut ist. 
* Verwaltung in Eigenverantwortung oder auch in Halb-Eigenverantwortung.
  * vorhanden, link erübrigt sich
* Treuhandservices durch multi-signatur Adressen
  * vorhanden, diverse Web Anbieter. Ist aber auch alles *manuell” möglich mit Wallets wie z.B. Armory.  ist eine Web wallet, die durch multi-sig Vorzüge von Cold Storage und Web-Wallet verbindet.
* Planbare/Definierte Geldmenge. Berechenbarkeit.
  * vorhanden, link erübrigt sich
* Komplett Transparente Buchhaltung für Organisationen.
  * angedacht, de-facto, könnte man das schon haben, es wird sicher SW geben, die einem das erzeugen von Reports usw. massiv erleichtert.
* Zeitblockierte Transaktionen
  * Es geht hier um signaturen, die erst in der Zukunft gültigkeit erlangen aber auch um transferierte Bitcoin, die nicht vor ablauf einer Zeit weiterfliessen können. Das ermöglicht ein paar smarte tricks und kniffe.  
Ausserhalb des reinen Bitcoin als Geld Feldes gibt es auch so einiges, was entweder ganz oder teilweise auf die Bitcoin-Blockchain baut. Hier ist zu beachten, dass es verschiedene Modelle gibt, um mit dem Bitcoin-Netzwerk zu interagieren. Es gibt sog. Meta-Coins, wie z.B. Colored-Coins oder Namecoin mit ganz verschiedener Architektur. Es gibt aber auch ganz per se unabhängige Netzwerke, die gut mit Bitcoin interagieren können. Bitcoin ist wirklich nicht nur “The Money of the Internet” sondern eben “The Internet of Money” und die Blockchain-Technologie zusammen mit anderen kryptographischen Netwerken und Verfahren wird sehr wahrscheinlich noch einiges hervorgebracht, das wir heute nur schwer erahnen können.
* Kleinste Bitcoin Einheiten dienen als Aktien. Dividendenzahlung in Bitcoin gleich an die Adresse, die die Aktien hält.
  * Mehrere Implementationen auf Bitcoin vorhanden. z.B. 
* Blockchain als Notar.
  * Jeder Transaktion kann eine kurze Nachricht angehängt werden. Das reicht z.B. für einen Hash jegliches Dokumentes. Damit kann ich z.B. beweisen, dass ich zu einem gewissen Zeitpunkt im Besitz einer gewissen Information war. 
* Nachrichten schicken über eine Spezialblockchain
  * Vorhanden, 
* Dezentrales sicheres domain-name System
  * Beta-Stadium vorhanden, 
* Seitenblockchains, die direkt mit Bitcoin interagieren können.
  * Erst gerade white-paper released. geht sicher noch 2 Jahre bis es in Bitcoin ist. Allenfalls gibt es alt-coins, die das erst implementieren. 
* Sogenannte Smart-Contracts, also Algorithmische Verträge.
  * Beta-Stadium vorhanden, diverse implementationen. z.B    
* Services wie Uber oder AirBNB komplett dezentralisiert.
  * angedacht
* Belegbar faire Wahlen
  * angedacht
* Dezentralisierte Tauschkreise
  * Beta-Stadium, 
* Dezentralisierte Soziale-Netzwerke
  * Angedacht
Ich habe wahrscheinlich einiges vergessen und werde Dir allenfalls noch weiter Links schicken. Damit bist Du aber vorerst mal versorgt.

Currently all cities in Switzerland fulfill that.

The problem ist, that if these things do not run on many distributed nodes (basically solo mining) the centralization issue is not addresses much. If they all mine on the same pool or on the same pools, there is still a central point of failure.

As Imstated already. Maybe it's not for everyone.
I agree regarding changes in purchasing power (volatility). It **can** be an investment, doesn't have to be. There are wallets, e.g. on Coinbase which are in USD and do keep a stable USD ballance, if you choose that type ofmaccount. So the volatility risk is hedged. But please also check out how stable the value of your dollars really is. You might be surprised... Also remember that putting money in a bank is not at all risk free. You might consider it the lesser risk, which is fine. Bank bail ins are real however. Ask the population of cyprus, they know. In 2008 some very very renouned US banks almost went down. Do you think all the customer funds would be insured?
I don't know venmo. Don't think it's availabe where I live.
I challange you to send 40$ from US to Japan and then to Kenya, Germany, France and back to the US. (might no be a usecase for you but stick with me for the experiment's sake). How much of these 40$ will be left? How long will it take to reach definite settlement? With Bitcoin this cost marginal and you are,done within 1-2 hours.
It's always a matter of perspective and usecase you have...

I have one: A man I do consulting for, is very very fond of Trezor. He likes the ease of use, just everything. By the way, the longer I read about it and consult people how to use Bitcoin safely, the more I like it also.
However he entered his seed words at brainwallet to check if brainwallet gives him the same address, which of course it doesn't. I had to urge him to change to a new seed a.s.a.p. There was some education to be done about when cold-storage is no longer cold.

I still have a screenshot of my account balance fromabout 12 hours before GOX went offline. So yes I did loose coins and I do consider them lost. I also know other who lost more then I have. You are totally wrong if you think that I am not sorry for the people who lost coins. This whole thing in facts bugs me a lot. I agree that the goxxing was hurfull for the whole BTC ecconomy as well. It's not all black and white, however.
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:20:14
I think it depends:
Do you know who's key it is?
Can you find ut who's key it is?
How much is on there?
How likeley is it that someone else finds this key also?
Did you find the key with the intention to find funds?
I have seen another post on this sub where a guy typed his favourite quote from a book into brainwallet.org. He found out that there is a rather large amount of Bitcoin on there. He posted the address here and on btctalk and asked who's it was. If they could provide the quote they would get the funds back (he tranfered them somewhere else). He gave 30days to do this.

Some of the features I picked up during a conversation with the issuer:
* Each Serial and Address is in a DB at the issuer with the exact time the address was funded.
* The QR Code is printed with e certain number of dots. They have a highest resolution scan not the QR in their DB. they can recognize if the Code was printed by them or not.
* Fireproof synthetic paper (pretty heat resistant and it doesn't burn as such. However, the wallet can of course be destroyed by fire)
* They have tried to look through the note with various imaging techniques, without success
* They do not disclose their source of entropy or how they handle the keys. (3rd party trust as with any paper wallet you don't create yourself)
* They exist in other denominations like 100, 200, 500 mBTC
Edit: clarification of fireproof

The thing is this. We are being generous as it meets our incentives.
A holder of Bitcoins is in a dilemma.
If he does it right he can increase the purchasing power of the coins by giving away some of them, be it sales or tipping/introducing.
If he works actively on development in any area of Bitcoin he also increases the value.
A man who knows a lot about money and currency lately told me that money was initially distributed downwards.
A Lord would release something which he could trade for wares. By doing so he truly gave something to the people. The ability to trade among themselves.
Bitcoin is doing that for the internet and the whole world as a kind of local currency. The incentives are set at least sufficiently well so Bitcoin could survive these 6 years.
If (big **IF** from a a **BIG** Bitcoin lover) the incentives are set correctly the last people adopting Bitcoin will not loose out on anything. All the benefits that made Bitcoin grow would still apply to them.
Isn't this awesome! A money which is designed to have the correct incentives to be a good money and at the same time enabling and empowering individuals plus incentivising them to do good and introduce others to profit from the benefits it has.

Another point: You will hand out an encripted backups to a family  member. This is for you to recover it just in case, right?

You should most definitely keep backups of your wallet. If in the scenario above your offline pc breaks, you will never see your keys again. This is why you should write the seed words somewhere. Otherwise you will also hardly be able to inherit these funds to someone
So far I would state that it currently doesn't hurt to reuse in order to protect your coins. However, someone just posted a measure by which theoretically one could compute private keys if some conditions are met.
I don't know about Electrum but Armory will by default always use a new address as change address. This means that an output is always spent unidirectional. No funds go back to the address where they came from.
Quantum computing? I once attended a talk from Vitalik Buterin about a simulator. But I guess now he is working on Ethereum so the simulator has to wait... Let's just hope that if anyone had a quantum computer which was functional that he would rather do something else with it then hacking you or me. But you can never be extra careful enough...
@_date: 2014-10-20 08:03:15
For my part cold-storage is only if I also know that the device will never touch the internet ever again after I created the keys. As I don't have the skills to either check code in detail not check my computers memory/hd for traces. I have a dedicated small computer and it will probably be destroyed once. This is why trezor, piper wallet and such are so good for laymen who don't want this hassle.

The stunt you have seen in this other post only works if you have fiat in there already. Even internal GOX transfers will not work if your account is not verified. So wait untill verified (will take some time in this mess) and then make a transfer of FIAT which will take another ten days. Stay away and be happy you don't have a GOX wallet so far.

I rather have the different model. Spend Bitcoin and re-buy with bank account as I spend. I can by no means cover all allowances in Bitcoin (yet). I try to only spend Bitcoin withing Bitcoin. Work towards a closed loop economy, which would make it a very powerful tool.
Still in an emergency, I would sell Bitcoins to cover something I couldn't pay otherwise.

"Every Bitcoin transaction is verified by a network of computers called “miners”. Anyone can join this network of accountants, which makes Bitcoin more democratic than traditional currencies. To prevent any one entity from taking over the accounting system and cooking the book in their favor, Bitcoin requires each miner to perform a hideously complex computation after it updates the books."
Doesn't seem to be all correct, this passage. It's a shame so many people thing that mining is a waste of energy although it secures the network. Also mining is not transaction verification. It only ensuring the order of the transactions.

I will try to give a very simple answer here:
You always have to keep in mind that a dollar on an exchange is in fact not a dollar. The same is true for BTC on exchanges. They are only tokens issued by the exchanges denominated in dollar or BTC. This is a huge difference compared to the real thing. Untill about a week ago, MtGOX traded higher then the others. This was because an MtGOX dollar is in fact worth less than a dollar on another exchange (If you want it payed out it takes at least, yes at least, four weeks longer untill you get real dollars). Now MtGOX trades lower which unfortunatley does not mean that the MtGOX dollar is worth more all of a sudden, it means that an MtGOX Bitcoin is worth less then a Bitcoin denominated token on any other exchange.

OK isn't there cold storage function on Electrum like in Armory? Never used Electrum but I thought this also has cold storage option by default. Just do your shaking again and enter the string on an offline PC/MAC which has never touched the net and never will (Electrum installed). Even if there was a keylogger, the log would never leave this PC/MAC. Then just create a watching only wallet. Turn off autostart which will reduce the likleyhood of a super fancy USB Stick traveling keylogger. It could only log your PW anyway as you normally don't enter your seed ever again, once done.
I think this should do for keylogger paranoia, right? Questions?

It creates a fully BIP compliant HD wallet seed. Any Bitcoins I receive are true on BC transactions. My GEMS ID is linked to this same seed. The messanger uses end-to-end encryption. Any GEMS I receive are secured through a social crypto-network which does not use BC.

This is why scalability is discussed so often. It's technicaly no problem to increase to 10Mb. There are many ideas and proposals to tackle scalability. Just increasing the size limit is a solution, it is a little blunt.
Even if we assume that full nodes do not care how much HD space they need, there is another thing which is a hurdle for scalability. It's the network latency. The larger the blocks, the longer they take to propagate through the network. This can lead to more orphaned blocks.

I like the post. I think it would be hard to implement, not only in Bitcoin. A lot of people ask why the "halving" is so abrupt and not smoother. The problem seems to be that computers do not like decimal numbers or nubers with fractions. There are always rounding issues and such. The current way the halving works is done baya shift in the binary number which results in the halving (all digits i.e. 1s or 0s are switched one position to the right). No strange numbers with commas there.

Armory is presumably the safest wallet out there. bitcoinarmory.com
It is a deterministic wallet which means that you can back it up once and then use it for ages. all new key pairs are derived from a seed-key (not for imported keys, new backup needed after import, or better swipe the keys, so no new backup is needed) 
M/N means that you can make a fragmented backup of your seed-key. e.g. 3/7. You create 7 keys (e.g. printed on paper) and any 3 of them can be used to restore your wallet. You can keep one at work, one under your bed, on at your brothers place,...

1.) Testnet is just a exact copy of Bitcoin afaik. You can play without using "real" money.
3.) The seed ensures that there is enough entropy and makes it very very very unlikeley that someone else will ever choose the same seed. All keys you ever generate should derive from that seed. If you have the seed you can restore your wallet on any computer.

It is intended. A so called "HD wallet" will give you a new address for each transaction. It will further also use a new address for each time you generate change.
e.g. you have 0.75 token, these are called unspent transaction outputs, lying around and want to send alice only 0.5 Bitcoins. Your wallet will initiate a transaction with 075 as input and with two outputs. One for 0.5 to alice's address and one for 0.25 for your change address.
Using these "HD wallets" (hierarchical deterministic wallets) has many advantages. One is that it helps you keep your transactions much more private by default than just reusing the same address over and over.

I have no problems with it. Please post logs and problem report in the official bitcointalk thread. The team normally responds a.s.a.p.
You point out something important. Wallet backups are only for keys created inside armory. If you import keys a new backup has to be made. so please rather swipe keys.
By the way. It is best practice to not reuse addresses and therefore use a new change address every time. Use coin-control if you want full control of your transactions.

Mining should better be called weaving as it actually is very productive.
Imagine a village which agrees on a monetary system where each transaction is weaved into a giant carpet which started very smalll. The more work has gone into making the carpet longer, the harder it becomes to just present a longer carpet other will accept. You need to invest the same amount of work in total as has gone into the original carpet. The carpet allows to look up any past and present funds and their position. Mining is essentialy just that, weaving the carpet. This weaving is payed by subsideries and transaction fees. The subsideries follow the extraction curve of precious metals hence the name mining.
I think the explanation above is excellent. I do not agree on the point that you have to read the paper to appreciate proof of work. The concept is older than crypto- proof of work and has been used in many monetary systems for centuries. Check e.g. this out: link will be added shortly.

However, If you calculate in the costs to organize a device which is offline and will never go online again to generate keys, and if you also count in organizing either a dedicated printer or a dumb printer, Trezor might even be the cheaper choice. I agree however, that the other setup leaves you more freedom as to how your backup scheme is and what wallet to choose for spending coins.
Trezor ia absolutley awesome for anyone who doen't want to bother to learn all the tech stuff. Just wants to hold or use.

You want some ideas (unsorted):
* DarkWallet still need a few coins to reach beta
* Moneychanger could probably still need some funds:
Alternativley you can invest in Monetas (3rd funding round)
* Armory takes donations
* OpenBazaar
* Once ready fund some stuff on Lighthouse
* donate some funds to the Bitcoin giveaway of the Zürich MoneyMuseum. Exhibition on Bitcoin will open in November. Also If you have any cool objects to go on display... You can read what has been organized already here:
*  Start your own project for the 50$ Bitcoin node
* Donate some to TOR Project
* Give enough copies of Andreas' book so it makes the international bestseller list ;-)
* Give out some free Bitcoin T-Shirts. People will weare them, I know.
* Invest in a BTC startup involved in remittance, If you haven't already.

Potentially the chain can fork everywhere. mining creates the consensus about the longest chain. you have to work for your vote which chain is right. If your work went into creating a block no-one else accepts, the work is wasted. So you have incentive to work on the correct chain.
With a pure proof of stake system, you can easily try to do an attack on the chain without loosing anything. You still get the same voting power on the correct chain as you are trying to vote for an incorrect one as well.

The money has to be distributed somehow, right? Therefore the early miners and adopters have it. Better then a central bank just deciding. The horders are in a paradox situation in a sense that they have to redistribute part of their holdings in order to make the stash they keep more valuable. One single horder can act selfisch, but all together shouldn't. In fact there are a lot of investments, purchases and donations from the inside of Bitcoin. This will most likeley help to disteibute the coins. It remains money after all so don't expect every world citicen to have the same amount.

I was asked to give a speech about Bitcoin for Hayek student’s organization. I thought, sweat I bring them each a paper wallet with Hayek design I have seen here on r/Bitcoin. I liked the design but there is no way to easily generate 20 wallets with different key pairs with this design. That’s why I regimped it for bitcoinpaperwallet.com.
I don’t know how to contact the guy exactly as his name is just Otto. I cannot contact him as I am not a member of liberty.me. I think he would probably be capable of doing a much better job than I but I think these are OK. I don’t know if he would approve...I just did it... If anyone knows the chap, please let him know.
I hope others enjoy the regimp as well. Make sure to find the right calibrations settings for your printer setup on bitcoinpaperwallets.com
My prints turn out a bit dark (especially the 500mBTC one) but my Printer is also not calibrated anyway and not of best quality.
Edit: If you want to use them just copy the 300dpi images into the images folder of your offline copy of bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Shorten the name of the desired design to match "front-300dpi-custom" or "back-300dpi-custom" accordingly. That's all.

OK another hint: Currently Armory needs a full node in the background. However, if you now decide to use another wallet, e.g. Electrum, then you have two possibilities to transfer the funds:
1. Google how to export private keys from armory. No need to be in synch with the network for that. Take any wallet that lets you import or sweep and then transfer the funds. I assume Electrum can sweep and then that's it.
2. Backup your armory wallet and import it at a friends place. Then transfer the fund to your new wallet.
It can take some time to find out which is the best wallet for you. Make sure to back up any wallets before even transfering any money there.

No, no. If you want to spend coins, you can prepare an offline transaction on your online device with the watching only wallet. Then you can export this transaction, which is complete apart from the signatures to a USB device (Armory is even working on audio transmission). you take the stick to the offline pc and open the prepared transaction in Electrum. Then you sign the transaction and export it again to the stick. Take the stick to the online PC and then broadcast the transaction. Your keys or your seed never leave the offline device. The signature can not be cut out and reused as it is only valid for this exact transaction. A signature for a different transaction will look different although derived from the same private key.

Yes, if you have a safe printer or use BIP 38.
However, keeping keys safe but still usable daily is the difficult part. I don't even personally use Trezor (Armory) but I have tested it personally and know e.g. a 67 year old man who does not originate from tech background and uses this. The device is seriously the easiest and safest to use for anyone who does not want to laminate new paper wallets all the time but still wants to use Bitcoin securely, regularly and to a certain extent privately (no address re-use).
All wallets I know of which allow offline signing of transactions are Trezor, Electrum, Armory or some command line based solutions.

The people at bitalo.com also wanted to crate a multi sig wallet. As far as I understood 2 of 3. You give them one key and keep two. One on your phone. After signing you send the tx to teir server and then log in to sign it again. I am not sure how far they are...

If you want to help the network, please run core. However, you need the whole blockchain for it, as you have gathered.
If you would like to download faster, install armory which will automatically download most of the BC via  torrent. Armory is the best wallet to run on top of a full node anyway... The core wallet is kind of old school regarding how addresses are created and such.
Another opinion is to wait for the next core release. it will feature "headers first" which will increase the download speed drastically.
If you run core, consider doing port forwarding of port 8333 to the ip of your system with core. ythis way you will become a full node, which relays transactions and blocks after validating them.

If you want to prevent running into using all 100 until the next backup, consider rather using a wallet like .e.g Armory, which is deterministic.

The wallet should have the coins in there. That the address is different is something the wallet does after it has received a payment. The old address is still good to receive further payment. It protects your privacy to use a new address for every incomming transaction. So that's why the wallet does this by default.
* What does your balance show?
* Have you reinstalled since giving the address to the friend?
* Can you post a screenshot of your wallet?
You should be able to find all the addresses used so far if you dig a little in the options, advanced features.

According to the argument made you can still deliver proof of stake for two chains, which you can't do with proof of work. So the flaw is not only about distribution.

Just state that Bitcoin is a technological breakthrough and that you have no clue if it will be around in 5 years. However, if it is still around they will have most likeley made a very good investment. (Don't get me wrong, blockchain technology will be around for may years to come anyway)

@_date: 2014-12-19 15:24:17
I have seen this argument a lot. You are **not** relying on the device to not break to keep your coins safe. You write down a mnemonic passcode (as many times as you want) to keep your coins safe.
Trezor is mch better if you want to spend coins as well, not just hodl. And safely printing paper wallets is also not that easy and requires special devices (offline device as well as a dumb printer if you don't use BIP38) which can easily cost you as much as a trezor.
I personally do not have a trezor in use, but I have tried it out and it is just awesome for people who want to use bitcoin without learning all the details.

Is there a TL;DR?
@_date: 2014-11-26 17:09:18
This is an interesting discussion:
Technology is always neutral. It has no moral/ethics. Of course the people using it can use it for moral or immoral things. Same as e.g. email or internet in general.
Maybe some years ago you would have posted in about the more or less exact same thing. It can be a good thing to withhold information if someone wants to send to someone else. Well...depending on who you are and who the people are which want to communicate with each other. You have to admit, however, that the internet has begun to empower people in a way which was unthinkable before. I personally think it's a good think information can flow freely, the benefits outweigh the downsides. Same will be true for money.
The core issue is: If we say it is good to withhold money/information in some cases, who will we entrust this power to? How do we ensure the executive force acts as the majority would want it? Are these people representing us well? I think with Bitcoin we would have more power as people. If enough nodes and miners e.g. blacklist (don't giveme hate for using this word, and my node doesn't blacklist anyone ;-)) an address, we have a democratic process in which we decide. We the people/users have the true power, not some people which we voted for (best case) who may or may not hold up to their promises.

Yes: Sweeping means draining the coins to a key you created. This hinders e.g. the creator of the paper wallet to spend the fund later. It is also pretty effective against someone intercepting a private key e.g. when importing into blockchain.info wallet (you are basically sending a private key over the internet which could be intercepted). 
Importing means just copying the private key.
Both have pros and cons. A con for sweeping is that the recipient of the paper wallet does not automatically have a backup already which he would have when importing. Generally sweeping is the safer practice.

No Issue: All you have to care about is that you backup your seed (mnemonic passcode which is 12 or 24 words out of a 2048 word list) accordingly. E.g. keep a copy in a safe and onotherone somewhere else. If you want you could also use special tools to make an M/N shard distribution out of that seed. The coins security does **not** rely on your trezor beeing functional. It relies on how well you back up and protect your seedkey. And because mnemonic passcodes are so easy there are no printers involved in backing them up. Just pen and paper.
Edit: Also your seedkey is never ever displayed on a computer screen. Only on the screen of the trezor. Trezor is designed so you can use it on the most virus and maleware infected PC somewhere in an internet cafe without risking anything. Only thing you should watch out for is that the pin digit display in the trezor is not seen/filmed by someone whatching you use the device.
Edit2: If your Trezor breaks, the seedkey is good to be restored on any other BIP 32, 39 and 44 compatible wallet. So you do not need to order a new Trezor to access your funds in case it breaks.

I like your explanation a lot and all you say is true. However,  I am still missing the hard facts why it can't work in practice.
Psycology can change. People are used to it now, OK, but habits can change an with it the feeling for "the normal".
Unions could easily have their contracts/agreements in purchasing power BigMacs or whatever. I know people who earn their wage in Bitcoin. They have no problem that they earned less coins this year then the last year as the wage is hedged against another value.
I think economy is a big instable equilibrium and it will always swing one way or another. Deflationary currency could be hard to getting used to but it would still work I think.

Why do you want to use another PoW for the second PoW step? Would it not work with twice sha-256? Normal hash against difficulty x. The first Hash, the signature of the first hash (with private key of the receiver address) will be hashed again by sha-256 and must meet difficulty y.
Or without 2-Step. include a signature for the whole block content into the block which has to be valid. We can probably find a consensus. Solves the problem even harsher. Just spinning your thoughts a little further.
Edit: Clarification. The could hashing is still not desincentivised. The main problem I see with both proposals. I like all the proposals however.
Edit2: Ok I think I get it 
Edit3: This confused me: For each such half-solution, miners use a second device, perhaps a CPU or a specialized card, to perform the second check until a full solution is found.

Yep this has certainly happened. E.g. on many exchanges the Bitcoins you have there aren't really Bitcoins. They are IOUs for Bitcoins. You don't control the keys. Not before you have transferred them to yourself. In order to use Bitcoin peer to peer You have to control the keys. Best are keys you alone control and have created yourself. Current wallets allow this fairly well. To have more then a spending or transferring amount of Bitcoin it helps if you understand its principles and act accordingly. 


If you design a commodity like digital currency it seems more attractive to create tokens which allow instant settlements, however. Like cash. You decide who you trust. Of course you have to trust the technology as well. But within that, it's really just that. Trust yourself. If you don't fully trust yourself, spread the trust as you wish. Same for transactions. 


Bitcoin is fully transparent. Google for block explorer and you will find tools to search the blockchain, and even [listen to it live]( You can have a completely transparent balance sheet if you like. I could e.g. proof to you that I own a Bitcoin. I could even make a transaction and show it to you. I could even sign a message with the same key and include e.g. my username. I can do all this without making the Bitcoins tangible to you. This and various specialties of Bitcoin transactions make it a very attractive tool to do direct p2p settlement over the internet.

I think OT has an interesting model for "trustless" servers. And it will hopefully come as far as providing voting pools on these.
However, doing any kind of business will always involve trust.
Even when using things like nash exchange or other forms of two and three party arbitration we trust someone.
And if not someone we trust math. A lot of the game theory part of Bitcoin is controversially discussed. Anything which involves incentives is also individual or swarm and mass psychology...

You don't need to be online to extract your keys. Go to yur settings and choose expert mode. Then look for an option (i think on the wallet detail view) to export a list of rivate keys. You might have to tell Armory how many you have used.
You might have to google a bit but bottom line is that you can extract your keys without beeing synched with the network or without even having a bitcoin core installation.
Edit: If you need help on the way, post in the Armory thread on Bitcointalk. The community is very responsive there.

Trezor should not be a problem. There is no battery. The seed can be imported imported to other Apps/SW as well in case mytrezor is down. In 2-4 years we will hopefully have many other SW supporting trezor, at least Armory or Electrum. You could even take it with you. Maybe there is internet at the place where youmare going in 2 years. Or are you going to jail?
I hope your friend is a good friend. Trusting 100k first to him and then to an exchange has double 3rd party risk. Why can't you just make an account for yourself? For these sums I expect all exchanges except probably btc-e to ask lot's of AML/KYC questions.
For the mother / ant scenario I would also feels safer with a M/N backup. e.g. 2/4. passguardian is a good idear. However, you should take the site offline if you don't want to risk your coins. Therefore rather use Armory offline to generate a deterministic M/N wallet completley offline.

I did a lot of testing yesterday. When trying to connect to btcmp.com on 8332 it redirects to 3333 and gives work in stratum. Diff is normally 32 but it can be other values like 160, 240, 16, 64. I did not find a way to influence it. --request-diff does not seem to help. Also --no-stratum just makes that I cannot mine at all. I have also tried a setting which forbids pool redirection. Once i managed to truly get diff 1 on btcmp but as soon as I restarted it went back to 32. But because I managed to get diff 1 once, I used a lot of time to try and reproduce. no-luck... Meanwhile i googled the Whois info for btcmp.com which lead me to contacting someone on facebook. Let's hope he answeres....
Only shortly tried polmine which does give us diff8 with the right settings. I am probably going to do more testing with diff8 and see if this might be low enough for us...

Two problems:
1.) Transactions are sometimes really  slow (not real time) when transferring  funds to an non-coinbase wallet. There are lots of reports regarding this. Can be embarrassing and uncomfortable if you want to pay that beer and the coiner party states that there is no payment. You then might pay in cash and the transaction will probably go through 30min later. This is not what is meNt by double spending but it would be a good term for it ;-)
2.) If Coinbase looses coins, gets hacked or runs with them they are gone. Of course they have insurance and are a trustworthy business in general. However, are you willing to go through all the hoops and wait for an undefined time if it happens? You din't have these problems with real wallets i.e. wallets where you control the keys. Make sure to have a reasonable backup scheme depending on amount of coins.
Best of luck

@_date: 2014-12-14 06:58:31
THX I already know passguardian and such. What I want is this fnctionality neatly integrated in a wallet.
All I would like is the same M/N backup functionality like Armory. But with Armory I have to use a printer (it has a printer safe function wich protects against compromized printers). And with Armory I have to run a full node (which I do but coukd be a hassle for the usual smart phone user). Plus Armory is not a HD wallet according to BIP standard. It uses it's own way to do things.
So what I imagine is that when I use e.g. Mycelium I have the option to backup mnemonic passcode (as it currently features). This awesome appart from one thing. It creates a songle point of failure and it is my backup.
So I would like the option to instead of one 12 word mnemonic create e.g. 5 and define that any three will restore the "real" seed. I am not sure this is possible the way I'd like it. This would be awesome however. I can than distribute the risk of someone finding the whole seed.
Just ask if you have more questions. I can not help you with implementation though. But I can formulate clean customer requirements if needed.

I would argue though, that Armory is probably truly the safest wallet for any newcomer. The hurdles Armory places are awesome in a way that they manage to exactly point you to the security critical technicalities. If you recommend it to a new user emphasize the importance of the backup (Armory will also do it X times) and tell them to reserve an afternoon for it. The experience will make them feel empowered.
I have learned so much about Bitcoin and asymmetric crypto in general just by using Armory.

I think there are tons of coins from unverified customers. They might have deposited a lot (sometimes e.g. SR related money) at times where no verification was needed. Then gradually verification was needed for more and more stuff. I really wonder how many funds will not be claimed because they are in puppet accounts or from people who no way want to disclose their identity?

OK thanks. How is it different from proofofexistance.com?
I am thinking a lot about how one would make a browser plugin to store the hash of every ingoing and outgoing email on the BC through opreturn. Now this would obviously cost a lot of fees for all the transactions. I am therefore thinking how one could do this so e.g. all people that do it are connected and are joining forces. Something like 1000 email of 1000 people are all hashed. Then a hash of the sum of all hashes is put into the BC. The protocol would require that I get the hashes from all the other 999 joiners. and store it together with my hash and the overall hash. If this is done the right way, there are no privacy issues as the 999 hashes don't tell me anything about the content of the 999 emails. This way I could proof of existance later. Idears, anyone?
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:41:08
OK thanks for the clarification. I was under tue impression that some wallets would allow any string to be used as seed. This would of course be violation of some BIPs, but doesn't really matter for a restore. I think some iOS wallets (probably BitWallet) allowed that, at least at some stage.

Sorry I dont get it. "Bitcoin Association Switzerland" proposes to treat Bitcoin just like any other non-Swiss curreny. This solves almost all regulatory issues apart from maybe mining.
Edit: This is also a question the parliamentary group for digital sustainability asked our federal council.

How are your coins inherited shall you pass away? Use Armory cold storage. Have a good M/N backup scheme.

Priority for most miners is the same. It's a function of TX Size, UTXOs age, fee and amount sent. For large transactions you normally get instant confirmation even with no fees. Dust amounts however require a larger fee to be processed. If the amount transacted gets too small, a TX will not be included at all. I don't know the exact rule. It has to be 7* what is considered dust or something.

have paper wallets with different denominations (e.g. 1mBTC, 5 mBTC &amp; 10mBTC). Maybe some of the clerks will be able to swipe private keys and give you a coffee and cake for it. Depends on the app they are using and if the people working know that app well.

Multi Sig web wallet. Three keys. 2/3 authentication. I park one key on the server, one on my mobile, one somewhere safe. I can not spend funds without sending the transaction to the server, logging in and authenticating it again. Can also be a A or B and C scheme. I think bitalo.com tried to build that but it seems they have downgraded...

Great idea. So like a m/n armory seed backup just for a single key. I don't think there is a special tool for it yet.
In regards to BIP38 (AFAIK the encrypted paper wallets): For a long time I did not see the benefit. However, I think these are awesome in case that you can only use an insecure printer. e.g. create wallets offline and then take them to a insecure by usb stick as a .pdf. Write the PW onto the wallet after printing. I guess there are other good use-cases but I don't know them.

I had an identifier recovered by blockchain fr a friend. They can do it if you can give them enough info about date and time. Even better IP. Then you van send them the PW by PGP and they will send back the ID. Obviously change the PW after that or crwate new wallet all together.

So for what I am looking for, how would it matter exactly? All I want is to be able too proof later that I was in posession of a certain info at a certain time. I would not see a solution anyway with which i could proof the info weas actually created by me (or someone else). Even when I sign the info it is still no proof it was created by me. However, all I would want is a service which basically replaces sending registered mail to myself so I can proof later that I was in posession of the info.
If I have a mail history dating back three years and I want to use it in court, the judge would have to gauge if I have planned all this from three years ago and started to "fake" a lot of emails from my opponent. I think in most cases the judge would see this as unlikeley...
I would be very interessted to hear if you have ever thought about this problem? Do you see a value in such a service? How would you construct it? How would it compare to my proposal above and to Factom?
I have not yet studied the Factom paper so, forgive my unknowingness of the whole topic.

And as others have correctly mentioned. Please backup your wallet. What will happen if e.g. you die? I am not sure if Electrum offers M/N backups, but Armory does.
Some more tips for the paranoid:
--&gt;Run your own node, e.g. through Armory. (With Electrum you don't)
--&gt;Never reuse addresses. This helps if you think someone could calculate the private key from a signature e.g. through quantum computing. This is also best for privacy.
Edit: one more. Never trust printers. Also beware when disposing of printers. Better use a secure print function, like in Armory ;-)
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:37:51
I am not an expert on electrum. Only thing I can say is that typing something on ypur keyboard increases risk of beeing keylogged. If you had e.g. a maleware which sends screenshots fro your pc that would not be safe either.
Always use a cold computer to generate keys. And best to make it stay cold and if it dies one day hit the hd with a hammer before you dispose of it.
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:37:45
Just accept it for goods and services. I do not recommend this yet for the broad mass, but tools like OpenBazaar will empower you to do your yard sale on the internet, free of charge. You should easily get 15-100 with a yard sale.
Unfortunately BitMit (Ebay for Bitcoin) closed (no scams or hacks, they just moved on). But that service was centralized anyway, so let's wait for decentralized markets.

Agreed. My point only was that as I see it right now PoW is still the best. It has a prooven track record. I am not saying that there are no problems, only that I haven't seen a solution which will be so strong to demolish Bitcoin. If the big farmers can destroy Bitcoin, it's not them to blame. Then the incentives are just not right currently. I still have lot's of hope as so many bright people are thinking about these problems every day. Plus every now and then there is a good proposal...

@_date: 2014-06-14 13:19:20
Yes: Sweeping means draining the coins to a key you created. This hinders e.g. the creator of the paper wallet to spend the fund later. It is also pretty effective against someone intercepting a private key e.g. when importing into blockchain.info wallet (you are basically sending a private key over the internet which could be intercepted). 
Importing means just copying the private key.
Both have pros and cons. A con for sweeping is that the recipient of the paper wallet does not automatically have a backup already which he would have when importing. Generally sweeping is the safer practice.
Edit: AFAIK sweeping costs some transaction fees as it happens on chain
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:25:30
I think it also depends a lot of how "old" the coins are you are spending and of course what the amount is you spend.

You are right. You can tackle a single driver. However, Uber fights with many other legal issues on company level. Apparently over 50% of their spending is for lawyers. In Switzerland e.g. they are currently under pressure as the government states that they are an employer (should pay social security money for drivers and tons more) and Uber states that they just facilitate driver/rider matching. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. An open source software gets rid of any company operating it so all these issues are gone.
For me it is basically a dream to have a decentralized Uber and I am willing to deal with some initial hickups/UI issues.
So no it is not immune to government regulation but it makes it much harder to tackle it. Otherwise Bitcoin would be gone already (see Liberty Dollar, Liberty Reserve, ...).

I am by no means a Trum supporter (not a US citizen anyway) but I think what sometimes happens now at these protests is a disgrace (thing that happened to you is just one of many examples).
I hate oppression of the right to demonstrate or to free speech. Problem with any movement is always the same, a few idiots are exposed most and all the image that stays is that of the idiots. No matter what group demonstrates from left to right, gay to straight, plack to white, the outside view is always heavily imprinted by the few idiots. Go look in this thread and you will find at least one guy who would love to "punch a few of these suckers". That would exactly be the idiot who sticks out and gets all the press coverage bout punching someone. Total distraction form the actual message.
Its a true sign of weakness if you can't let others speak and demonstrate in peace.
I don't mind people protesting now and think they should be able to, but I don't get the people who don't vote (who could have) and got to protest after. That said I think it was difficult for many voters as they felt there was no good choice.
I wish you all the best for your future and sorry for what happened to you that day!

Since you have only received semi-serious answers:
Noone knows. It could epically fail tomorrow. However if you search the internet you will find articles which make estimates based on how much of which market takes over. e.g. if Bitcoin takes 1% of market X it has wffect Y. There was even a webpage where you can enter you own numbers. I go have a look...
Edit: Here is one 
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:22:33
This will ony work if the previous transaction is not yet embedded in a block. You are lucky if you send to an address where you know the recepient. Worst case you send the coins to an address where noone controls the key. This is called black-holing. However, Bitcoin addresses have a checksum and this at least prevents you from typos.

1 hash in Bitcoin means one round of double SHA-256
So 1000 petahash equals 10^18 double SHA-256 rounds.
However, it could also mean the hash-rate (speed) in hash/second. A lot of people abbreviate it and use it without the "per second" bit.

Please, if you accept Bitcoin, try to be as professional as possible. Familiarize yourself together with your tenant what app/provider to use. He shall make a proposal. Accepting bitcoin is great, however, it can be done the wrong way. There will be a learning curve for sure. My request is just that you e.g. also train your staff how to collect a payment. I have been to so many BTC accepting places that had isseues, it took very long, personel was not trained. Thats OK there is no "quality standard" which you have to fulfill. The nerds, however, will more likeley frequent your business, if the payment is a joy.
Make sure the ATM can have a stable internet connection. Make sure to clearly state at the ATM that it is not operated by you and whom it is operated by.

Oh ok, sorry for just dropping these on you.
1. IOU (I owe you) is basically something like a certificate. Now if you buy bitcoins on an exchange or on e.g. Coinbase they will credit you bitcoins, right? Except that they aren't. What you see in your account there are IOUs. It means they have a database entry that they owe you x bitcoins. If this exchange goes bankrupt due to whatever reason (heist, theft, incompetence, bad luck, bad security, ...) all you have is an IOU which means nothing in that case. They still owe you but there is nothing to be had. To prevent this make sure to withdraw you bitcoins from the exchange to a real wallet. This means they will pay you out in (this time real) bitcoin. Only then you actually own bitcoins.
2. Now the above mentioned proceeding has many advantages. You won your money and decide how and where to spend it or how to keep it safe. However, there are also drawbacks e.g. that nobody can help you if you loose your money. No company you could call and get a replacement. Same is true if you send coins to the wring address. If you know who's address it is you can ask them to give you your money back, but there is now way to force them to. bitcoin is a push system as opposed to a pull system (e.g. credit cards). This is why you need to back up your wallet and keep the backup (or many if you like) safe. I recommend Mycelium wallet if you are on Android. Make sure to go to settings and create the backup before even receiving money there. The backup will be good for all future funds you receive. So if you backup today and have 0 bitcoins in your wallet, then you receive 2 bitcoins over the period of a year and then you loose your mobile, the backup will restore your two bitcoins and all of your financial history. I can explain more but I think that will do for now.
3. I just point you to one [good video]( to start it all off...
Have fun!
Edit: If you have further questions don't hesitate to ask me.

What I don't understand here, is that not all of the balance is gone. I also don't understand why someone would wait to steal until you are away for a few days. If I had your keys and was a thug I would make a TX a.s.a.p. as every minute I wait it becomes possible that you move the coins.

OK first of all, thanks for helping wrap my head around this. I was also under the impression that we find many diff1 hashes but don't submit until we find one of higher difficulty or have more than 1 together or something. The pool clearly advertises that it's a diff1 pool. So minimum share difficulty would be one. For some reason it seems to be different though.
So the Getworks are packages sent from to pool to us asking us to create hashes of the content. I was always under the impression that diff1 means that any diff1 hash can and will be submitted to the pool and be accounted for. This is of course more traffic and validation effort on the pool side, therefore the higher fees for get work diff1 than for dynamic stratum.
Do you agree that normally a worker sends back the "solution" to a work package as soon as it is found?
Maybe our mining SW is holding back on sending. This might be a reason the Rej are non-zero. maybe the workpackage is outdates until we submit the "solution".

@_date: 2015-01-25 02:14:05
Yes like that and beyond that. The tricky part is getting it right with a distributed solution with no central point of failure or control. Just imagine if e.g. Coinbase becomes the market leader and handles 80% of Bitcoin (IOU) trade/transaction volume. Why not just raise the fees and voila you kind of have a new paypal. Also they could start to dictate what you can or can not spend your money on. Of caurse the advantage with Bitcoin is that it is open for competition because the Bitcoin protocol is open. However having a decentralized, open-source and free solution to support all these transactions is still very desirable. I hope this will be either on Bitcoin itself or on a sidechain or something. Lets see how this plays out.

I was nder the impression this 15$ are no longer charged.
I once sent 3000 CHF to GOX. The deposit never arrived. I asked the Bank and they stated that the polsh bank had some regulatory issues. Long story short. My money was in limbo for 11 business days and came back 200 CHF or currency conversion fees short. I had no way to get my 200 back. This was when I realized that I should buy more. I told my bank that it is fair enough if there are issues but it doesn't justify holding my money in limbo for so many days.

Yep QR or audio cable are on the radar. So long just make sure you have autoplay disabled on both your sysems.
I think (no real clue however) that writing a vector which travels on the stick forth and back when you have autoplay disabled is quite hard. You mght also consider using a different OS on the offline machine. Might make it even harder. There has been some story about standard USB Stick formware which can be altered.

OK, a pure Bitcoin settlement needs to be on the blockchain. However, for certain applications like e.g. collecting money for a few drinks someone consumed, I might not need an on chain transaction immediateley. It might be good enough for me to know, the amount will be on my address tonight.
So if someone e.g. gives me some Bitcoins via ChangeTip, all I get is some IOUs for Bitcoin. However, I can payout my Bitcoins (on blockchain transaction) e.g. after a week with 7 tips totalling 5 $ worth or so. In this case I am relying on a trusted 3rd part to hold my Bitcoin IOUs. This is not ideal but good enough for the amounts tipped.
People are working on more dezentralized/crypto/no trusted third party systems for everyday transactions and mcropayments. e.g. Open Transactions would be such a metha layer which allows for cheaper off chain transactions almost as secure as on chain and also without trusted 3rd party. I will not go deeper into this and there are many other schemes and systems like e.g. sidechains. Search this sub or google to learn more.

Why not open it now, that it's no longer used anyway. Look I am not the technical guy here, but just today I did read your review of BWallet (or whatever it is called) and it was very much appreciated. I am not a tech guy really, so sorry if this questions seems stupid: In this review you made statements about BWallets possibility to track your name together with BTC holdings. How can I be sure that your old non-open-sourced bridge did not do exactly this as well? ~~How much effort is it to open-source it? Are there parts which are licenced? What's the big deal?~~
Edit: Just seen your answer below... I assume you can't track my funds as there is no HW identifier on the device as in BWallet.

I have a totally different proposal for you as the others you got:
Buy the cheapest miner of ebay or so. Learn how to let it mine on a pool. To see direct results use a pps pool like btcmp.com. 
Learn how to mine solo, if you run your own node (don't expect to find a block).
Get everything else sorted before buying a bigger minder. Have your MinePeon or other server ready.
Just to learn it doesn't have to be new and efficient equipment. If you have a way to get cheap electricity however and have a concept how to get rid of the heat, go for it...

Let's say it that way: It is still totally transparent and every coin is accounted for. And in theory the transactions could still be tied to identities but it is much harder and much more outside information is needed.
* Keep in mind that Bitcoin transactions allow for multiple inputs and outputs. So the wallet can e.g. organize a multi in and output transaction on a metha-layer of Bitcoin. Several participants join together in one big transaction, CoinJoin, CoinShuffle and so on.
* Further addresses can be used which can be reused but in the background still create a new address for every sender. Stealth addresses.
* You can avoid mergance of coins from different sources. If coins are never merged, they are harder to tie to an identity. Merge avoidance.
Several ideas exist to get more from psydonymous to anonymous. I guess the idea is to be able to adjust transparency according to needs.

The one I know in Zürich charges 5% and that's also too much. I think 3 % would be fair and sustainable at least until there is serious competition which would hopefully lower the fees a bit more.
As much as I would love to support my local BTM, I rather buy with CC from Circle if the fees are above 3%. According to the owner of the BTM however, there is enough turnover from him to make it worth wile. A plus certainly is that you don't need to give ID scans and such to exchanges.

After all you want to have maximal income per visit. So if the cash drawer of my BTM was always full at 12% markup, I maybe wouldn't change it. However, if the cash register is only 10% full each visit, I would try to lower the fees to attract more customers. If you gauge it right, you can maximize the profit. I doubt, that the cash drawer is always full at a 12% fee.

The other response is good, however you can just create a new wallet on your current mycelium wallet and transfer there. It will war you that you are transacting to yourself which is ok.
Never invest to make an old probably insecure wallet safer, just get a fresh one.
Just for info: if you still have your old phone you could try to delete all keychain data. Google how to do it. Even if someone now has your old phone your current wallet is still protected by your PIN.
Good Luck.
Edit: Only delete the old wallet on your current phone if you are 100% sure noone (including you) will never willingly or by accident send anything there ever. Otherwise just keep it, mark it as archived or something and make sure the new one is your active wallet.

My best guess here is that the best would be a bank transfer. The bank charges you conversion fees but they might be lower then 2* exchange fees. Plus you might have problems to get an account on a Canadian exchange. Now if you don't have a Canadian bank account, there might be another problem. Most exchanges will only pay out fiat to a verified account under your name. So it is probably not possible that they give the money back for you.

Its essential about people being able to trade online just as they would in real life. I ship you something and you give me money. While this works on a flee market, it's doesn't online. People get scammed or ripped of, goods have shitty quality, or one guy ships the other doesn't pay; whaterver... So this problem was solved in decentralizsation 1.0 or light as I like to call it. Ebay, Etsy, Uber, and whatnot. It largely benefits people, to e.g. be able to sell their old car to someone they actually don't know and there is a trust system and some insurance involved. Now the problem remains that all these intermediaries like ebay and paypal kind of do a great job, but it doesn't quite work for everyone. Not all people get banking and credit cards. E.g. in Belarus you can't have PayPal. So you can't participate in the global market. Plus lot's of salesmen get accounts disabled regularly for whatever reasons. What if somebody could solve that problem? What if I could truly connect with you directly but still have securities? If we can build a trust system which essentially doesn't need a central manager. If we can have a market for escrow services whitin that system. One day we might even have have the possibility to trade p2p but still have insurance through [2 party risk arbitration](
My main reason to use it is that I have many things I want to sell which are kind of frustrating on ebay. I't something special and needs time to find the right match, specially in the small country I live in, for items not worth shipping internationally. Now on ebay, I need to pay already to have products online. Every offer expires and needs to be renewed. This was often frustrating for me as I don't want to sell items under value and rather keep them. But I still had the whole hassle to create the offer. Now with OB i know that my offer can be up as long as I want for no cost.

I think Electrum and Armory bascally have the same security level. However, I think Armory is a bit more secure because
* Verifies transactions against your own copy of the blockchain.
* M/N Backup included
* Printer safe backups (so your printer does not need to be secure)
* Also multi-sig if needed
Many more features like e.g. simulfunding
For me M/N is the key selling point. I think a HD seed is something which is at risk if someone finds it. You can back it up as often as you want. If one copy gets found, your coins are gone. M/N lets you choose your security model much better.
Edit: Also consider buying a Trezor if you don't need M/N
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:35:44

Correct. In order to use the full address space you have to use good entropy. Hashing a six digit pincode will not do.
However, this is not a problem of the Bitcoin protocol if there are bugs in random generators. Use dice rolls or coin flips or whatever to create 256bit entropy. Create a private key and address, if you want to be sure to use all the space manually.

I always thought that the number of transactions per minute/hour/day is one of the biggest latent risks for Bitcoin.
I was always under the impression this can be fixed, but it never got quite enough priority and I like that it is final getting it.
People would always argue that there is time and that we can wait for the "real", "clean" solution and I disagree with that point.
The biggest killer for a new product/startup is if it is trending and can not meet the demand. Just imageine there is a currency crisis in EU/USA/Brasil or even in a smaller country (Cyprus 2.0). If people will finaly get that Bitcoin is good for them and serves them as well. Transaction volume could raise significantly within days. Just imagine the confusion, insecurity and bad news this is causing, specially among the new users who are not as drama tolerant as we are if the transaction demand can not be met...
In my view, this change can not come fast enough...

Potentially lower prices, higher variety of products. Todays hippers kind of feel it if they can support people without someone in the middle taking a cut. I have no source for this but I once heard that Uber spends 50% of their salaries on layers. Now just imagine what a decentralized Uber would mean... The driver gets more while you pay less. No company which can be tangled up in expensive lawsuits  and be attacked by the taxi cartel. If it is deemed illegal in some cities or states, the only thing you can target is the individual driver and customer. Kind of makes it hard for the cartel to find the right point to attack.

You don't redirect the transaction. You kind of use your "access code" in another client. Just for your understanding. The public key is derived from the private key. The address is derived from the public key. Therefore if you import a private key into a wallet it know which matching address it hast to scan for funds and show you the balance. If you want to spend the funds your wallet signs a message to the network using your private key. This will signal to all nodes and miners that the funds shall be moved somewhere else.
You can have key to addresses in several wallets at the same time. They will stay in synch.

Hi Orion
Great to hear that you followed up on the topic. I think everything is starting to come together in your head. This will continue on. In my case for several years already, as you never have questions to all your answers and all answers raise new questions.


I guess Bitcoin or something like it is the future, in financial regards at least. This does not mean it is exclusively the future. Hopefully we are going to see a lot of diversity in this space, or at least more than what we currently have with government monopolies.
If a country wants to ban Bitcoin it can do so by creating a law rendering it illegal. This does not, however, technically hinder anyone from participating. It would all be pushed underground and in the short run you would have a decrease in demand. Another way is to monitor internet activities and censor packages which you think are Bitcoin transactions. However, this is not so well feasible as there are VPNs, proxies, TOR, encryption, mesh-networks and many more ways to get around it. That's why there are still government critical Chinese who blog without being caught so far. So it makes it harder, but it will be extremely hard to make it impossible. The legal aspect is also interesting. Why would you forbid someone to to math and send numbers over the internet. If you forbid Bitcoin you almost forbid freedom of speech (which some countries of course do). 
Beware about the anonymous part. Bitcoin is pseudonymous. So once somebody know which group of addresses are likely associated with you, they can look at your past and future transactions. Now of course there are several ways to make Bitcoin more and more pseudo-anonymous (coin-coin, mixers, merge-avoidance, stealth addresses, just to name a few). The great thing about it not being anonymous (other crypto-currencies are trying to do that) is that you can build transparent constructs with it as well. So if you are accepting funds for an NGO or so, you can be 100% transparent about what you received, what was spend already and how much is still there. This is an important aspect of Bitcoin as well.


It wasn't ever an option in many stores. There are still new ones accepting it (currently not the ones which profit from tiny transactions) but it is correct that some have stopped. Currently it looks like Bitcoin might become some kind of settlement layer rather than electronic cash. We will see. It's good this congestion happens now where we are still so tiny so we can sort it out without too much pressure. Even if Bitcoin does never goes mainstream (we are far from that, the market capital of Bitcoin is currently about half of the domain name market --&gt; tiny) it still has huge potential.


Maybe the people in power are just underestimating cryptocurrencies?
China is very restrictive on transactions to foreign counties. I think the Chinese exchanges are feeling this also as they seem to kind of fall into this category. Some countries like Argentina forbid you to buy foreign currencies to not loose power. Still dollars are very popular in Argentina and it seems to stay that way. I think your last point is correct. Since Bitcoin is currently so tiny nobody cares too much. For a national economic scale it is only a handful of people putting money towards Bitcoin, too minuscule to have effect on their economy. Rest assure, if suddenly everyone wants Bitcoin and big businesses would start accepting it and generate significant turnover in Bitcoin, the stance will/would change. So they might underestimate it, some don't even recognize it at all but for now it really is a niche phenomenon.
Welcome again! Beware that you are starting to go down a rabbit hole by investigating about Bitcoin. One might lead to another. Personally I have gained many valuable insights along this process.
CU around!

I disagree with the not taking part if technically not 100% fit. I think some of the devs who are really deep into that might profit from a more distanced view.
Many developers are checking for weaknesses in proposals and code and that is awesome and I am so greatful. However, 98% of those weaknesses are probably not even relevant when considering the whole self-interest/game theory aspects bitcoin brings into play. Not saying they should not be looked at, just saying many seem to be rendered irrelevant when considering the big picture.
Scenarios regarding mining centralization are irrelevant in my opinion. Either we believe that the we have more honest miners in the network or we have a 51% attack ongoing. I see this almost as binary, only these two states really matter.
For these reasons I think that we could allow any block size. Miner will keep the balance in the magic triangle (fees, blocksize, propagation latency). They strive to maximize the profit. Bitcoin seems designed to allow just that and function just right when everyone keeps their own interests in mind. So letting miners strive for profit doesn't necessarily decentralize mining but it keeps miners honest. They kind of know they get the best deal when being selfish and thus serving the public. Further they consider their options wisely as they know that their whole business model is built around a public illusion which could be muted significantly if they take the wrong turns.

Nope will take some days untill you have all blocks downloaded and veryfied. Next time consider using a simpler e.g. mobile wallet. breadwallet for iOS or Mycelium for Android. Now even if the synch does not finish for some reason, your money is still not lost. You could export the private key from the core wallet in offline mode and import it into any other wallet.

As you are also asking what a wallet realy is, it might help to understand further. A wallet is basically any method to keep one or several acces keys to bitcoin funds.

There is a bitcoin stack exchange where lots of your questions have been answered by many people from different perspectives
I agree that asking questions is the way to go.

E.g. your infinite growth assumption. Why would it have to grow infiniteley? Why not assume growth to e.g. a current credit card tx volume and then another 2% p.a.?

As I am running a node anyway, I use Armory which is the best wallet I think, at least if you run a node. You will not find more security features anywhere. Besides Multi-Sig it can also do Simulfunding (just like Mike's Lighthouse).

I see you found out already.
Now beware, the 1$ worth of Bitcoin isn't yours yet. All you have right now is an IOU for 1$ worth of Bitcoin from ChangeTip. In order to have one 1$ worth of Bitcoin for real you would have to withdraw the Bitcoins from ChangeTip into a wallet (e.g. Mycelium) where you control the keys.
I would say it doesn't matter that much for 1$ worth. However, if you were to buy a significant amount (whatever that is for you) on an exchange, this becomes very relevant. So make sure to withdraw, only then you have no lnger any 3rd party risk. You will be responsble for your own funds then, however. So....**backup** your wallet, not later, **now**!
Best of luck to you!
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:30:59
So you mean the next block mined by the pool which offers the service? Because to guarantee inclusion in the next mined block you would have to control 100% of the network hashrate.

double check the address you sent the funds to is actually the correct address in your "gaming" account. If it is, I would contact the operator there. They might have a problem.
Please beware of one thing: You did trigger a Bitcoin transaction. Note, however, that at no time you were in the "possession" of the "real" Bitcoins. On local Bitcoins you had IOUs for Bitcoin and you basically asked them to do a transaction to your "gaming" provider. Once the Bitcoins have arrived there you should get IOUs for Bitcoin from the Gaming provider. If any of these companies go down, your IOUs are no longer worth a Satoshi. Just imagine you let someone hold your cash for you and told them to give it to someone else. You never had the cash in hand. If you want to hold the Bitcoins in hand (no 3rd party risk) you would need to use a real Bitcoin wallet, like e.g. Mycelium.

Sorry I don't have lots of experience with their API. this might help you a bit:
When looking at transactions on their webpage you will only see propagation if the transaction is not yet confirmed. Try it out and you will see it. Plus they will also show you if there is a double spend attempt. I bet someone else can help you better as to how to include in API.
If I was you I would send the licence as soons as their is enough propagation and if there is e.g. no double spend attempt after 1 or 2 min. Once someone really did scam you, with these measures it might be worth thinking about more measures.
Also I think BitPay will not charge you an fees for your first million dollar turnover. I don't exactly know what you are selling so it might be a hassle to go with them. Raw bitcoin is cooler anyway.
Be aware, that maybe the probability that you get scammed by someone trying to show you a fake BC.info site (man in the middle) is probably higher then them trying a successful double spend. I wouldn't be worried at all, especially not if these licences are in the price range you mentioned and especially not if one might not profit from having several of these (as opposed to e.g. gift cards). So going trough the hassle to prepare the attempt is probably more expensive regarding time and effort then just buying it.

What he calculated was basically the influx of new money (mined or printed/issued) compared to the total money of that type in existence.
There are in fact different inflation comprehensions. I mean by it the relative growth of circulating currency. Others would argue that is is also linked to e.g. economic power. In that case there could be inflation even if the circulating currency is reduced just because the currency is devalued by other means like e.g. political uproar. The same is often very confusing when discussing deflation.
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:46:11
All Bitcoin nodes and miners always accept the longest chain and build on top of it. Thats a consensus rule.
If I manage to mine blocks which I don't publish and and secretley mine on top of them and thus manage to create a longer chain than the genreally accepted one (not likeley as you can see in the sheet unless I have close to or above 50% total hash power), I can publish it any time and the chain which was accepted as longes until then will be orphaned.
This has nothing to do with anonymity, pseudonymity or privacy. You can just publish the blocks to other nodes. They will accept it as the root of the new blocks go back to the genesis block and the chain is longer than what they currently see. Proof of work is valid and they will abandon the other chain.
Hope that helps.

Is this the cause for all troubles?
* Wallet backup takes you to the wallet restore. No way to back up.
* Creating new account causes the app to bug out and go to home screen.
* Sending of funds does not work no matter how I try.
Good thing I have the same wallet on my android as well, which works like a charm.

I often hear: "Is it still worth it?"
People mean that as an honest question because all they know about Bitcoin is that its some money you can print for free with your computer. No one acctualy cares about what it really is, at last not when hearing about it for the first or second time. I usally tell them that mining at home most likeley wouldn't be for them but that Bitcoin is about a lot more than that. Sometimes they want to know 2 or 3 things which I gladly give them an answer to.
Edit: I think if it will hit 1000 again, which I think it will if it doesn't die, it will be much more sustainable. Might also be Willy bot III or something. I hope not.

That .bak file is definitley what you need. As other suggested back it up before fumbling with it.
Right now it seems you can't get your node to synch. If the problem persists and a new installation (after complete disk backup) does not help you might want to try daves wallet recovery services (payed service). Lot's of other people here could do it as well but only hand your file to people you trust.
Hopefully you will get away with a little adrenalin kick and be able to post on TIL Bitcoin wallets should be backed up, always! ;-)

So If you were a miner with a certain hash rate (25% in the first case here) anyone offering you a bribe for more than this value it make sense for you economically to accept the bribe and try to mine on a seperate chain for a number of blocks. This break even point is where you expect statistically (over multiple attempts) to have the same amount of BTC in your pocket as if you were mining honestly. It is not as much as the missed reward on the honest chain because there is a probability that you succeed with the "attack" and in this case you get the block reward plus the bribe.
Does that make sense now? 
@_date: 2015-04-13 06:30:18
Thanks for your input. I will check the sheet later on PC. I want to explain some things:
"50.454" actually means 50454 and not 50,454. Was just the standard setting for google sheet. Americans seem to separate the 1000ns like that where I would probably format it like this 50'454. Will see if I can change it.
11.8 is the bribe you would need from where on it gets economically interessting to accept a bribe for the try for the miner. 212 is the transaction size from where it gets economically interessting to bribe somemminer to undo it.
~~Should definitely get more expensive to bribe for more confirmations as the miner works longer on a likeley unrewarding chain. I will have to check that and report back later when I am on a PC.~~
Everything seems fine here. It does get more expensive for more confirmations. Please check again and tell me if you still think it's wrong.
Good idea about making more columns to the right for more confirmations or probably also different bribed hashrate. Just added it.
I think the bribing concept is fine. Not that I wanted to do it. I don't see how another truley decentralized crypto would ever overcome this problem. Bitcoin is in theory not safe for a super high transaction unless you wait for e.g. a day.
Edit: Things.

Thanks for this answer. I actually went and crated a profile on BTCLendingClub today. Still awaiting verification, which I think is not needed for lending, only for borrowing. But I just want to see all the options and features.
I plan to lend some money mainly in South America, India and Philippines. Maybe elsewhere to. I think I'll also start with about 1 BTC to get the feeling of it.
Regarding UX I think BTCLendingClub is pretty good.
What I miss, is fund holding in 2 of 2 multisig with locktime as GreenAddress does it. I think this whole thing is just waiting to get hacked or being prone to an exit scam if this is not implemented next.
I really hope that one day, Services like GreenAddress will just be usable as a platform so anyone can implement their ideas without worrying about keeping funds safe.

It is good an bad. I work in this industry.
* It is good that it does ensure a certain level of testing and a certain level of proof that methods work and are validated.
* It is bad as it basically prevents any startup or young company to be able to compete with the current big players. The only way to have your product on the market is to sell out to someone who has all the processes in place to get approval and is able to produce GMP conform and already has a global distribution network. Forget all about viral spread of new methods, it just doesn't work without the big players. Also think that lot's of countries have their own FDA derivate and you have to comply with all of them as well if you want to sell there. This leads not only towards a centralization of the approval process but also towards centralization of development, research, production and distribution. I beleeve that e.g. in oncology 3 big companies or so could easily make agreements about prices and this might have happend already.
Just for reference: I work in diagnostics but a guy from pharma once told me that only all the clinical trials (phase I-III) for once substance cost approx. 1 billion dollars. About every 10^th subsance makes it towards approval. Some studies can be stopped before phase III so on average you spend about 5 billion on these studies only to get one substance approved. This does not include R&amp;D, production, distribution, marketing, ...

You would have to know where in the network the receiver is listening in order to fool them. Otherwise t is just a random attempt.

Well depends on how much someone is willing to pay. Of course this sheet does not account for Bitcoin reputation losses if someone pulls the stunt. But it for sure shows that you need to be a pretty big player who wants to do a big transaction (and need connections) to make it work. Plus the receiver needs to accept few confirmations only. Plus you need to be more or less unknown to the receiver. If he knows you he would ask you to send the transaction again, as you still have the money. If you don't you don't keep your part of the deal and might be made accountable in front of the law.

I have some honest questions to you and some other buttcoiners who might be on here:
1. What is the actual purpose of This might be a strange question. I have only been there once or twice while following a link. People on this sub often state that people from deliberately come here to troll. Is this one of the intentions? Do these trolls exist? Or is it rally just that the masses on this sub just don't like any negative comments about Bitcoin and regard any critics as trolls?
  * Side note from me: I do see that there are some people on this sub who don't seem to enjoy Bitcoin at all and seem to deliberately only post negative comments (not per-se critical ones by informed participants). I seriously wonder what their motivation is. I mean, who are these people? There are tons of things I don't like but it wouldn't come to my mind to go and just comment on such subs all day.
2. Is a spin-off of the buttcoin website which is now basically owned by BFL? Found the website quite funny before it was sold out. Never went there again after.
3. How cult-like is Is it really just a sub for discussing crypto in a less cult-like manner? Or is the cult just in the other direction. How would you describe the average buttcoiner?
Thanks in advance for your honest reply.
Edit: I think it is kind of dangerous if you consider to be the Bitcoin community. Besides beeing a news outlet this sub is also for circle-jerking and drama. Lot's of people come here for this. If you don't like it, I think it is a good decision to go elsewhere. I would like to understand you motivation to go to and be a mod there rather than getting involved on many of the other subs which are for crypto and try to be more serious than this sub.

Well...I must say that after being in this sub for quite some time, this is just not true. Especially when meeting with other people in real life who also frequent this sub. I certainly don't believe this is going to happen anytime soon and if it were going to happen it certainly wouldn't happen because of Bitcoin alone.
On your second point. That is just the most disrespectful thing to do. You think it helps to empathize your point to make fun out of people? Do you think this is how you win people over? If it is only for your lulz then I think you are just very immature.

Many wallets can do this. Check my comment above. You will probably have to set the amount manually for each.
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:23:32
Technically speaking you no longer have cold storage. If you chose a strong PW for your wallet it is going to be fine. However, it is probably still abput 1000x more prone to brute forcing by others than before.
However, if you consider everything this might still be the safest option for you. Private people are probably about 100 times more prone to loosing their wallets/keys than actually having them stolen or brute forced.
Edit: The question is what do you want to achieve with this backup method? You still need a good way to backup your passphrase. If you only know it by heart, all encrypted backups are not going to be any help, e.g. in case you die. M/N backups are much more appropriate for this scenario.

Difficult topic as there is no such process which is easily described. It's all organic growth (and sometimes decline). The math in Bitcoin is not more legitimate today than it was 5 years ago. Only because there are some voices that Bitcoin is becoming more legitimate, does not make it so. And Bitcoin itself does not care about how legitimate others see this technology.

I think this whole trasury thing is different in switzerland. I am not exactly sure how it works here. Not as transparant as Bitcoin...
Basically what would happen if the initiative passes would be that all book money on bank acounts would be turned into full money. All regular bank accounts would become "depots" for swiss franks. No more interesst on these accounts (negative or positive). Full reserve for such standard accounts. If you want interrest, you would have to get an account with an investment bank.
Inflation rate and monetary base would be exclusivley steered by the national bank. So only the SNB could issue money from then on, no matter if it is coins, notes or book money.
I am not sure if I would vote yes, but I hope that the initiative comes together as it would foster discussion about monetary policies etc. And we could make some advertisement for Bitcoin like this: "Bitcoins are full money!"
I don't completley get the initiative and lots of people argue that it doesn't help much as it will just force the SNB to make more money, so the inflation would just shift. We'll see.

OK just checked on my Mycelium on iOS. v 1.1. has this bug
paging How can he get his seed out of there
Edit: Just tried to create a new account on my iOS Mycelium wallet and it also bugs out. Really wonder how extensively this has been tested....
@_date: 2015-04-12 06:43:11
For someone paying 100$ I would still accept 0 confirmation payments as long as the network propagation rate of the transaction is 99% or so. There are wallets like blockchain.info or Mycelium that listen to other nodes at several points of the network and tell you the propagation rate. When the propagation rate is 99% a double spend is very very improbable already unless the buyer controls a significant amount of hash power himself.
A lot of devs would probably argue against this point but if you accept payments in a brick and mortar store I would't be worried at all. I think for a decent attempt to fool you an actual node connected to lot's of other nodes is musch better then a mobile wallet.
If you use a payment provider like BitPay or Coinbase there is nothing to worry about as they guarantee you your money as soon as the page shows that the payment is confirmed. AFAIK BitPay one stated that they never had a single problem with this strategy. They also have a strategy to check network propagation of the transaction and probably some other parameters like if there is a little fee in the transaction.
For 100$ the problem is about as theoretical as for 5.
Now lets try to calculate a little example how much it would cost you to bribe a miner who has 25% of the hash power to help you do a 1 confirmation double spend. There is a lot of game theory involved and I might not be thinking about all parameters, but let's try:
So first we need the probability that the miner can present a longer chain after the transaction has 1 confirmation. So the miner needs to mine 2 blocks in the time the network mines one. These too blocks should then not include the initial transaction where the one block mined by someone in the 75% of the network does include it.
So the probability of the miner finding the initial, block at the same time (transaction not included and he of course withholds that block and keeps it to publish it later when he found the second) as the network is ~~25~~33%. Now he needs to mine the next block on top of his faster than the network mines another one on top of the block which includes the transaction. Lets keep it simple here and say the probability is 0.5 times 33% (50percent change the event will happen before)~~also 25%~~. So his chance is somewhere around 6.75%. In this case he gets two block rewards plus your bribe. In the other cases he looses his potential to have roughly mined halve a block so 12.5 BTC. So for your bribe you want to purchase Mining power worth 12.5 BTC for a ~~6.75~~ 5.5% chance of success to double spend a one confirmation transaction. So for you to make it worth to bribe him, the transaction has to be something like ~~185~~ 212 BTC just for a break even. Of course you risk to piss of a lot of people and is is still gambling.
However there are some transaction amounts which are that large that from that stand point should never be made in the bitcoin network or let's say you would have to wait for many many confirmations. Also if you assume someone has access to miners wit more than 50% of the hash rate ~~(not another 100% on top of the current hashrate which you would need for a true 51% attack)~~ the success probability becomes much higher. So if you assume your customer has access to many miners or pools there are certain amounts you should not accept at all over the Bitcoin payment network.
~~On mobile right now. I might edit this post later on PC to make it more clearmand remove typos. I will inform you if I do so.~~
Edit: I think I was off by a factor 2 so the break even would be at 370 BTC, but I will give this some more thought and correct the post later when I have a decent keyboard and spreadsheet.
Edit2: Some typos and numbers corrected.
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:51:14
I think you have all types here and I would guess most are kind of both. Beware that is not the whole bitcoin community. This is a good place for news and drama. Other places are probably more serious.
Regarding volatility: Volatility will hopefully decrease as the coins get more widley spread and **if** institutional investors start trading and holding Bitcoin. Today the market can move quite a lot if just one seller or buyer moves a substantial amount. Nobody knows yet what really happened at MtGOX and to what extent the two bubbles in 2013 were related to that. I for sure hope that a professionalization of exchanges will avoid such large (probably artificial) bubbles in the future.

I don't really get where this "lot's of criticism is dismissed" comes from. I actually see lot's of criticism which is taken very seriously and also up voted. Especially if it is constructive criticism or benevolent feedback.
What I do see is ton's of short, non-well explained buzz word feedback, which is not that helpful and not that productive. This might get down voted more often. So if people say e.g. things like "merchant adoption has recently stalled", just like that without any sources, that might get down voted. Most people have read it over and over, so what is the added value? If a longer case is made out of it and some sources are cited, it is very much upvotable. We should still not expect as many upvotes as for a post about a new merchant accepting Bitcoin (e.g. EDEKA) as this is mainly a user fan base as explained in the post above. That's completely OK, I think.

I think you are right, however, I am not sure a blockchain would make sense. Another system where semi-central entities audit each other in a dfferent way might be more suitable. Something like OT voting pools. Much less of a burden to achieve the same kind of security it seams.

Use Case:
You want to buy secret information of someone and this information costs you 500k USD. You have the information already but it is encrypted and the other party is willing to send you the description key as soon as they have two confirmations for a transactions worth 500k USD.
If you had the resources and knew some miners, it would be well worth to bribe someone to try and mine on a secret chain until you get sent the decryption key after two confirmations.
As soon as you have the decryption key the bribed miner release the blocks he mined secretly and thus releases a longer chain which everyone will mine on from now on. So you have successfully double spended on him. You spent the money once, and can now spend it again on the other chain. If the other party doesn't know you, they have no way to do anything against you having the info.
If you check the sheet again, I have updated it with different scenarios regarding hashrate and confirmations.

Mycelim also features watch only addresses which you can also use to receive payments. The only problem might be that a malicious customer might still try to make you spend the coins back although you can't. So in this case just a paper QR-code (several, new one for each customer) might be better. On the other side you want to know if the payment is there...
Edit: The malicious customer will also see that it is a watching only address by the red warnings underneath the QR code in Mycelium. So this could even prevent them from putting pressure on the receiver.

I know but you have to compare the influx of new money compared to the total money in existence. Therefore the halving is not the only relevant factor.
There are in fact different inflation comprehensions. I mean by it the relative growth of circulating currency. Others would argue that is is also linked to e.g. economic power. In that case there could be inflation even if the circulating currency is reduced just because the currency is devalued by other means like e.g. political uproar.

All is lost here. Humor will not fix it.


So only altruistic behavior? Just like the pro-Bitcoiners who have no self interest at all to promote Bitcoin? /s


No I would not. I find it funny too. However, this sounded kind of different then before.


Mocking is actually fine. However, I think that sometimes you can overstay your welcome no matter what the point is. So if you e.g. try to persuade somebody that investing in Bitcoin might not be a good idea and they want to try none the less, why not stop there. Not saying you do this but there are some posters who just deliberately spam this sub with anti-Bitcoin points. Seems like they scan the sub all day and try to look for post which are suitable to dump their negativity on.
I had the same experience with Bitcoin. I had to learn that the average Joe does not give a shit about it and that I cannot tell them about it all day. Guess what, now I only tell people about it who come to me to learn and that works out much better for all. So maybe buttcoiners have to learn that we like to circle-jerk here (we can’t do it in the real world after all) and just move on to spend their time on other things.
It's like someone would tell me that basejumping is the next big thing and that we are on the forefront of an entire new development and industry. I couldn't care less. And if they told me every day I would kind of get pissed off. So maybe the down votes and reporting for these critical points is some kind of swarm intelligence (euphemism here) to protect the sub against this negativity. Maybe unlike you, most of the members actually enjoy it as it is?
What you (maybe not you personally but you took a stance for buttcoin here) try to do is just like if I would spend my time over at all the religious subs to tell people that all the stories that are told in their books make no sense at all and that their religion thing is just a waste of time. I may say it once to a friend but if he wants to go on believing BS then so be it. I respect that actually because I grant everyone their own opinion and the right to develop it further. What would I get out of it to continue?
People who come to might come here because it offers a new way to do things. It offers a new scheme. Fighting what you don't like normally is a waste of energy. Why not work on something better, something which makes the old things obsolete or at least goes into that direction. This is what attracts people to it. Even if it might have flaws here and there, it is an entire new way of looking at things for many of us. People don’t post here that they have their mind blown, because they see Bitcoin on the streets all day. The white paper alone, the concept is enough. Most people just never actually thought about any of it before. Most people actually never think about money at all apart from whether they have it or don’t. Bitcoin made me think about what money is, how it should be and what the requirements were if I was to design a form of money. This alone is a huge step for most of us.
So from what you toled me about buttcoin, I get the impression it’s a club to fight something, to fight Bitcoin and try to hinder new people migrating into it. You try to save them from losing their money, hopes and so on. What's the point? It's evangelizing among people that might have already formed their believes. Just for a different thing than you.
So what is it that brought you to Bitcoin initially and what are you doing besides trying to save others? What is the productive stuff you work on to actually overcome the problems you see with Bitcoin? There must be something which drew you to it initially. What was that? Does it not interest you any longer? Did something else fill that spot?
I know the post was kind of not well structured, but I think you get my points.

No I am not convinced. Ethereum was funded much and fast. But with the promise that people would get Ether in return. Other projects had similarly good funding, AFAIK all with some promise of return.
I bet you DarkWallet would have much more funding if it would be some altcoin/sidechain where people would get some dark tokens in return.
And no, if you look at the link you will see that the 130 BTC did **not** yet get funded.
This probably also shows how important privacy is for the average user?
Even with 3 devs being payed by MIT, there is nothing stopping anyone from adding more funding through other means. Plus it stays open source and nodes and miners stay the ultimate deciders which code they run. If they don't like Gavin's changes, they will not install them.
Edit: Bottom line is that projects or operations where people get some direct promise of return are normally well funded (GAW miner, Paycoin, Cloudmining, you name it) but donations to non-for profit open-source stuff like Bitcoin, R, GIMP, LaTeX etc. are normally not so well funded.

I am not trying to apply "that logic".
I merley wanted to point out that DarkWallet was not a good example to show how things get well funded by the public in this sector. That's whats started this discussion.
I also don't want to say that no non-profit projects get funding. Many are sucessful, you are right. However, talking about logic, because Wikipedia does get the funds does not mean this can be applied to other projects.
I just wanted to voice my oppinion.
Another oppinion of mine is that it's not so easy to just propp up some people to donate, only because they are known to have a position in this. Especially when it is know that they have already spent lot's of money on development in this sector already.
In fact VCs invest in about 20 things whereof 19 will fail and one will return 30 fold. They don't have a problem to let go, otherwise they wouldn't be successful at what they are doing.
**We** have to fund the development and help in whichever way we can. All of us who have something at stake here. And if MIT helps, I am the one who likes this.

Dear Paper Wallets and Liberty Enthusiasts
Before giving a Bitcoin speech at a Hayek Club I saw [this post]( on reddit, and I was excited that I could hand out some liberty inspired paper wallets for this occasion.
I soon found out that the wallets were not designed to actually being produced with standard tools available. Basically they meant manually printing QR-Codes and gluing things together.
As the [original article]( was published on [liberty.me]( and I did not have an account there, I had not option to contact Otto (now on reddit as the creator of the designs. So I ended up [regimping the wallets myself](  so I could print some in an easy manner.
Later I was able to contact Otto through an acquaintance (who has an account on liberty.me and this lead to a collaboration of Otto and me to bring you these designs including a fork of [bitcoinpaperwallet]( to make it easy to print these out easily, also in larger quantities.

If the miner is connected to you through any chain of non transaction withholding nodes, he will see your transaction.
If he sees your transaction he may include it based solely on on rules of mathematics which are applied. these are rules like dust filtering, double spending prevention, invalid signatures (honest nodes wouldn't relay this tx to him in that case), fee rules....
On top of that he might apply any other rules he sees fit. He could e.g. have a blacklist of addresses, Not include OP_RETURN transactions, or many things more.

@_date: 2015-04-11 12:52:23
Wery well explained.
I think one thing is a bit misleading here. An entity with over 50% hash power could not double spend. All they can do is undo history and undo the transaction. So for a successful double spend they would have to have a signifficant amount of hash power plus the private keys for the addresses where the UTXOs were which were used in the TX. So the Entity which tries to double spend needs to be the same or afiliated with the entity with the signifficant hash power.
Bottom line is, that entities with signifficant hash powere will never be able to sign for you, no matter how much power they have. They can only make transactions undone or suddently present another longer chan. Either your transaction is in their or not. They cannot spend anyones money for them.

The main problem you are facing is that there is basically no service operating directly in the Swiss banking environment as of now. All major exchanges go through either USD or EUR. You can have an account for both of these in Switzerland but as soon as you want to make your deposit, you will have to convert and loose something.
Best option as of now would be to ask a broker to help you, like BitcoinSuisse or SBEX.
There are also some 2-way BTMs but there are also some limits per day.
Depending on how much the Canadian banks want to charge, they might still be the best option.
If you get lucky you could find someone who wants to buy a rather large quantity on localbitcoins. Since you will probably not want to collect a huge markup, that might work.

A p2p bitcoin client means using bitcoin with your own node (there are some lighter options as well) which means you profit from the so called trustless properties of Bitcoin
If you use a 3rd party service like BC.info there is always some trust in that party. Trust can be regarding:
* Security of keys
* Personal data, user history, privacy
* 3rd party could fake that a transaction is incomming although it is not
* Man in the middle attacks are possible
* ...

I think the double spend watching like it is done on Mycelium or BC.info is very mch sufficient for normal amount transactions. Only for transaction worth that much that there would be an incentive to bribe miners to paticipate with you such a double spend (they can loose all their work if it fails so they will bot do it for free) would be a concern of mine.

The answer is yes. Acces to your coins is contained. Some wallet use the standard but kind of start with another "pocket" which could mean that you import the see and see 0 balance (exception case but I think Mycelium and breadwallet do not 100% behave the same in this regard). In that case I would try another wallet and if that fails there are tools to basically get every orivate key out which is contained in the backup.

Did that for my kids, wife (yes she is older than 18, just to prevent the long trail of comments below) and nephews. The coins have a letter which company the coin. The letter contains instructions, e.g. that if money is needed it is probably better to sell than redeem and redemption should only be done if money is needed quickly. Further the letter contains a printout of a pgp signed message from Mike Caldwell that he sold coins xyz to me and handed them over to me personally in Salt Lake City.

In your case and with bitcoin being so young, I would probably use a 2 of 3 paperwallet for each kid. Keep one slip yourself, give one to Mom/Dad, Give one to the Kids and explain to them that they have to keep it safe. Depending on age of course.

I have to disagree: Private banks should not be able to "print" government money. They can for sure "print" as much of their own IOUs or whatever. And yes banks should be free to have their business model as long as it does not involve "printing" CHF which they don't have. This initiative will not forbid fractional reserve banking to full extent. You will still be able to give your money to a bank and collect some interesst. It will ensure however, that you can have a depot of CHF with the bank which is 100% reserve banking, obviously there will be no interesst on it. 
I personally collected several signatures. Not because I am 100% sure that I will vote yes but mainly because I think it will trigger a very important and long overdue discussion in Switzerland.

I don't think you are the only person. You actually should download bitcoin and synchronize it with the network first.
How I currently start armory.
1. Run BitcoinQt --datadir=F:\Bitcoin
2. Once up to date with the network. Run ArmoryDB --satoshi-datadir=F:\Bitcoin --datadir=F:\Armory
3. Once ArmoryDB is ready, I start Armory itself with --datadir=F:\Armory.
When you are at step 2 for the first time, it might help to use --thread-count=1
Whenever Armory fails to start try cleaning it's datadir. As you see above you can customize it's location. Armory is tricky to get clean running and synced just after setup. After that you should be fine however.
For extracting the keys, offline mode should be fine. For that you don't need bitcoin or an Armory DB.

It was nice of you to accept it. However, if you prefer cash ($) the cheapest and least hassle method would have been to ask him for cash ($). Since te transaction involved a physical item, that would have been easy. 
Now it kind of depends on how much it is if it is worth the hassle. Probably easiest to just use it. Check out sites like gyft.com (gift cards for btc), purse.io (amazon for btc) or fold app (starbucks for btc). Getting cash notes would either involve meeting someone in person or signing up to an exchange and selling then transfering to bank and then cashing out.
I propose to just keep it safe for now untill you can use it directy. Please back up your wallet!

Don't you think that a massive portion of the coins which are in the Books of GOX will never be claimed as they are from accounts which did not want to verify with GOX in the first place (When that change happened that you had to get verified for withdraws) or from straw man money laundering accounts?

That sound very strange. It should accept it if it meets the standard implemented, no matter if you spend funds or not. However, since you want to abandon this wallet anyway, do a child pays for parent transaction. Pay 5$ in fees to get this thing sorted quickly. If your fees are at least 10 satoshi per byte, you can also try the VIABTC tx accelerator. Ty it just after the full hour has turned, as they only accept 100 tx per hour:
Edit: If they accept your tx they will include it in the next block they mine. Since they don't own that much hash-rate, they only mine a few per day, but still enough for it to work. have used it several times with success.
Also: Maybe try a new Electrum installation on another PC or device to restore your seed. That might help.
Good Luck!
Be aware, your funds are for sure still there and not gone. So don't panic!

Hi there. I found tools to look how big it is over time or to estimate the fees.

People join tx inputs together and split the outputs in one big transaction. If done smart, it gets quite hard to follow the trace. Of course it has to be implemented correctly, otherwise the organizer can get a privacy issue.
If you e.g. give 0.254 BTC as inputs and want to get this as output as well, you might be the only one with this amount and it could be assumed that the input and output addresses are connected. If 100'000 people join with 0.1 BTC each, you would create a huge blob of 10'000 BTC. Hard to link any specific input to output. People do several rounds of this to increase the effect. Beware that the input and output are must likely still recognizable as a CoinJoin tx. Therefore some wallet devs mentioned to include the feature and turn it on by default (option to turn off). The more people use it, the more powerful it gets, the more fungible bitcoins get.
Edit: Best case the organizer is some kind of decentralized trustless protocol. However, I am not up to date what current state of the art is.

OK thanks. After reading your summary, I am not worried much. I mean who would use the last printed wallet if the device got stolen right after using it. Normal room temperature changes for a day or so will probably make this kind od attack impossible already.

Thanks a lot for the comments and the references. Very interesting.
Factom seems kind of strange as it does a lot more than what timestamping alone would need. It introduces much more...

Ruining value is just not enough. Even if it might destroy Bitcoin, crypto-currency will always at least survive in a niche (as it is today). this might no longer be called Bitcoin. This innovation is a genie that will not be pushed back into it's bottle. That I am sure off; to an extent I can be.

As far as I understand it, no one needs to have the key to the bitcoin address you want to spend from at all. A valid signature produced with this key can be constructed after all. that is very smart and I was actually wondering how long it would take until we can take the M/N concept to a whole new level...

Yes I would assume so as well. However, there seem to be some hurdles right now why almost all concepts which are used right now are TX based.
I have just gone through the Factom paper and found a section where they explain why they use OP_RETURN an not the ChronoBit way or block header:


headers (as in chronobit) or in the Bitcoin block header coinbase. The P2Pool headers would
require several hours of mining to find a block which satisfies the P2Pool rules, and the added
complexity to the Factom protocol would not be worth the benefits. Including the Merkle root into
the coinbase of a block would require cooperation with miners, above and beyond the
transaction processing they are already doing. The coinbase entry would still need to have a
crypto signature from the Factom system, so would not save on much space relative to a signed
transaction. Not only would it be un-prunable, it would also be included in headers - first
downloads, affecting Bitcoin SPV clients.
So is the block header method what you would propose?

You would have to normalize these values either per value unit transacted or stored. This then still leaves out the different features but will give a more honest comparison
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:05:07
Hmmm.... I know it's always a trade of between features and ease of use. What I love is that the camera symbol can be used to scan addresses and private keys and takes you to the respective workflow. It would maybe make it a bit more of a hassle for those who want to spend from paper wallets (and have excess money returned to the paper wallet) but I would prefer if it asks me two options after scanning a private key: 1. Swipe (to active wallet), 2: Spend from paper.
An other option would be to give access to the swipe feature in the details of the wallet. This is where I was looking for the feature intuitively. I was expecting an option there to swipe a key to this wallet.
The problem here in Switzerland is that ATM providers are not allowed to have you provide an address. They need to print a paper wallet for you. This is because the licence is basically for a currency exchange. the other way, there is no guarantee I am not scanning the address of my aunt in the USA and thus making it a triangular trade which would need much harder licencing KYC and stuff.
I introduce lot's of people to Bitcoin by either supporting them how to buy at an ATM or handing out paper wallets. I think they should use Mycelium as it is feature rich but still easy to use. I guide them through the backup and explain them shortly what a deterministic wallet is. The sweep process is much more of a hassle and kind of complicated to explain in current Mycelium implementation. This is the reason behind my request.
@_date: 2015-03-29 09:36:32


I am not sure miners would be competitive against the proposed (or similar) way. Creation of the hash tree needs some resources. That part is probably neglectable. However, accepting the hashes and sending out the proofs needs some bandwith. Would that affect their latency? Or is this also neglectable compared to stratum load?
If this is a hassle for miners, I would expect the fees to be higher than what can be done in the proposed or similar concept.
The end user probably doesn't care about paying more or going though more hoops even if he is told that this other method is better as it has no blockchain bloat.
Edit: e.g. Originstamp already offers it's standard service for free for as many hashes as you wish. They just create one transaction a day. Kind or hard to convince anyone that the should pay a lot more.

Ethereum is runner up as they have a more united community (appart from the ones which have forked off already, well technically the current Ethereum seems to have forked off of classic). However, Ethereum has a strong leadership with Vitalik. This is what also unites the community. Bitcoins leader or past leader Satoshi is not tangible. There are pros and cons of this. If Vitalik would e.g. vanish, die or whatever, that could have a major impact on the runner up. This is not a problem for Bitcoin, but clearly doing decentralized consensus finding and leadership is more difficult.

Nope was inquiring about how many GB of ram your PC has.
However, you seem to want to just export the privatge keys.
1. Download lateds Armory version
2. run in Offline Mode
3. When entering the wallet, you can look at different keys. If you don't want to just export all private keys, you will have to check in an online version which keys have unspent outputs. (If you import the wallet onto an online system you can to both in the same version)
4. then you can click the relevant addresses and click on "view address key". This will be a private key you can import or sweep into any other wallet.
Also people on bitcointalk armory sub are very helpful. Maybe there is an easy way to just export the first 1000x private keys of your HD wallet by command line or so.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:13:40
If the TX is already recognized by e.g. blockchain.info it means it will go through eventually. Maybe the fee was set quite low? However, you can export your seed and import it in BitWallet. Beware to safe the seed from Bitwallet first, just in case. BitWallet should allow you to import a new wallet and leaving the old one untouched. Still, ensure you have a backup.
Now, if the TX takes too long, your BitWallet should be able to spend it again. Make sure to choose a high fee like 1mBTC so the miners will prioritize the new transaction.
For next time: To transfer BTC from breadwallet to BitWallet you don't need to send the coins on chain. Just import the seed and the wallet will synchronize and show your ballance.
Does this answere your question? Sorry, I have no clue how knowledgable you already are about Bitcoin.

There are three modes you can choose if you use armory. Basic, Advanced and Expert. In Basc the interface is of course more basic as well.
My guess is, however, that at least 50% run it in Expert mode and probably more than 95% in either Expert or Advanced. Offline signing is only available in Expert and Advanced.

I would like to add my personal little story regarding my pension fund here in Switzerland:
Just to get everyone on the same page. Pension funds are obligatory here and you can not choose which one you take. The company you work for determines which one. Also the government dictates the pension funds how much min and max holdings of which assets they can have. I think e.g. real estate is capped at 5% as the government does not want increased real estate prizes because of pension funds investing. I think shares have a much higher cap. So these funds are sometimes forced to make risky investments for us.
Back to my story. I started to work for a company in 2008 just before the crisis. The pension fund coverage for our fund was 126% at the time. Interests rates quite high and payout rates as well. After the crisis they got scared and sold many shares for cheap and went more into gold. We all know, most shares recovered by now and gold went down. Every year since then I get a letter about decreased interest rates and pension payout rates. So even with these decreased rates the coverage ratio is now just 101%. With the same rates it would be below 90%. Just imagine how much of my pension money was "wasted" during this process. I have no say here.
Guess what happens now. Shares are high, so they are selling gold and buying shares. Gess what will happen during the next cisis.
I am not a full on libertarian or anarcho capitalist. Our system works well for most thing. I probably would be if I were somewhere else. I am generally not against "forcing" us to set aside money for later. However, I think it is a disgrace that I can not choose which pension fund or just get an account where I can do my own trades in case I don trust any institutional pension funds.
Edit: typos
Edit2: I should probably mention that I am still one of the lucky ones. Other pension funds have gone under the required coverage rate and the employees have to pay so called restructuring tributes. These are deducted from the salary and will not be accounted towards the personal pension stash. Of course there is no guarantee that this will actually secure the fund long term. So the pension fund of my company is still considered a good and solid one.

Apart from that I clearly don't like your tone. I think you also might be a little to self confident regarding how reliable your judgment of people is.

It's also called M of N backup. You create N shards e.g. pieces of paper. Any M pieces are needed to restore the wallet. So you can e.g. creat a 3 out of 4 backup (any other combination possible).

2. Merge avoidance so this one customer can not gather info about which other addresses you control.
3. CoinJoin or other types of mixing to enhance point 2.
4. Stealth addresses.
5. ...
Edit: Point 4 is somewhat similar to 1 with th advantage that you can display it on a public website.

Regarding the credit: Switzerland has pretty much the [lowest interests rates for mortgages]( Average joe gets an ~~much better~~ equal interests rate than Mark Zuckerberg (news reports [here]( with all his assets. Just want to say that deflation or low inflation does not necessarily mean that it's bad for borrowers.
Edit: Newsreport states that  Zuckerberg got a 1.05% mortgage. However, they do not state for what period which is very important. 1.05% for e.g. 10 or 15 years would be very good.
Edit2: Below they state that he pays 0.8% on top of Libor which is what average joe would also get in Switzerland, at least at the time of the article. Today it would probably be 0.9% as the banks now need more of their own money to finance mortgages in Switzerland than at the time of the article.

I have no clue about these things on HW level. However, I think you can also give the device a "salt" which will be mashed together with the HW generated entropy every time you create a wallet. So you can add e.g. dice entropy to not depend entirely on HW entropy.

First let me start with an advice from the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy: "Don't panic!"  
I don't know how long it will take each miner to kick your 0 fee transaction out of the queue. Maybe it would get mined after a certain time.  
However, it seems, you would like to make this go faster. I had the same problem once. The easiest way is to export the keys (the ones you used to sign the 0 fee TX) and import them into another wallet. Mycelium can do that, BitWallet, well actually almost all wallets support that feature. This new wallet will tell you that the funds are still spendable. Now you can spend them again with a higher fee and the TX will go through very fast.  
Beware, that some double spend red flags might go up, e.g. if you check the TX on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:16:17
In this case it checks if nodes verified the TX and checks them by SPV? I think the expression confirmation is reserved for "included into a finished block" also if some blocks are already on top, no?

OK, let me try to explain it:
[2.1e7 - 0.0231 is the number of coins which will be the maximum ever reachable]( according to the consensus in the Bitcoin protocol. Scroll down to the bottom of the second table to see for yourself.
People with Aspergers have the tendency - half knowledge again here - to have good feeling for numbers, symmetry. Things need to be exact. Otherwise it kind of bugs them.
On the other hand people with Aspergers have the tendecy - half knowledge again here -  to be a bit challenged socially. Things like sarcasm, irony or subtle hints/jokes are probably not their strength.
so the joke was that "2.1e7 - 0.0231" would be a more correct name for the company than "21", however not a good one to reach mainstream adoption as it is very confusing. People with Aspergers however should appreciate the proposed name by as it satisfies there desire for mathematical correctness. Therefore the joke about getting 100% of the Aspergers market with this name.
This line of posts is exactly what I like reddit for. A classic. And the joke got even better when people with Aspergers joined in. should be on the front page of reddit!
So may I ask you if you dind't get the joke because you didn't know about the exact number of Bitcoins once block rewards are finished or did you not get the joke because of the connection you had to make because you only saw some strange number and Aspergers mentioned together? If the first is true, do you think you would have gotten the joke if you knew about the number of coins? Pure curiosity.

Just spoke to a guy from a big suisse insurance and he was like: "What if we create such a system - not Bitcoin - and put about 10% of our reserves in it just to make payments accross branches and affiliates faster, would this work?"
My answer: I encurage you to think about it more, I see some potential, some obstacles and hurdles and you should first think about what your needs are. What happens if one participant fails to move fiat funs e.g. for a sale of the tokens from sink to source. What if a branch becomes insolvent? Bitcoin is awesome because even though it is a tiny niche product it has some level of global acceptance and although it is currently volatile it will not be influenced that badly because one of your branches breakes away. Why would you want to maintain a blockchain if you can have a shared database?
Was not the exact order and I elaborated some more.

@_date: 2015-10-20 12:49:50
I see it like that after thinking about it for some year now:
* High inflation incentivizes taking of credit but also means you can not finance anything without credit. Therefore investments which potentially result in (economic) growth  are more likely to be made, not matter what kind of growth. You will not get credit from a bank to fund an non-profit organization. I wouldn't give you credit for that either.
* Low inflation or deflation incentivizes saving and thus makes it more likely that projects can be realized where growth is not so much in focus. It therefore helps to realize idealistic projects.
Of course it is not as black and white but this is the quintessence, at least for me.

I am not so sure about that... Why do you think people with approx. 80% of the hash power think they can create an alliance to change? Why do you think a majority of node soft fork might have to do a difficulty change, maybe even an PoW change. Because the new PoW would be "better" than the old? No, because that low work chain would be vulnerable to mining attacks. It is in fact less secure, just simply expressed in numbers. Strength in Numbers, remember? Therefore the big miners simply don't care. I run a full node, I meanwhile consider it a "listening" device which burdens the network more than anything...
@_date: 2015-10-30 23:18:51
There are similar thing but these rather happen client side like Lighthouse, where the funds of many purgers must reach a total in order to be able to be released to a predefined address. Armory also has a similar feature which is called simulfunding. In both cases you basically give a conditional signature, the condition beeing the total of all conditionals must be amout x. Your sgnature is only valid in this case. This is however not enforced by the blockchain itself, so a client must still broadcast the tx after the condition has been met.
Regarding your second question, it can for sure be done with similar but extended smart contracts, but currently I would personally not know how exactly. There are several Bitcoin 2.0 (Metacoins and stuff) implementations in the works?
What would you want to do in this second case?

@_date: 2015-02-23 19:28:47
Basically no. Within the bitcoin protocol nodes are not incentivized. Probably they are incentivized indirectly through game theory.
Edit: One incentive sure is to see incomming transactions without trusting other servers or e.g. blockchain.info.

Hmm seems to be a lot of negativity in the comments of the post. I think it is unfair to an extent as you are not advertising doge here.
I agree that altcoins are a wonderful laboratory for testing of new stuff and i also agree that crating alts should be encuraged, in a sense that it helps to test out new things. I also see that doge doesn't offer much in that direction appart from the community and tipping culture.
Yes we should try to make sure not to give scamcoins a platform. But this is even more so for Bitcoin startups. We are very quick to upvote the newest hype without even personally knowing the people behind them. So lets not get to picky on alts, lets do our homework as well.

So the only real option seems to be shildbach currently or maybe electrum.
However, Armory is also developing a lghtweight version which should be connectable to the full Armory you can run at home AFAIK.
I think for broadcast your own node is not that important. Main advantage is for receiving. So you could probably also have your full node configured to send a message e.g. email when a TX is incomming.
Or as someone else suggested, you can use a remote desktop App like NoMachine. Just make sure the address you are pasting is in fact the same as the one you scanned.

Which merged mining system would that be? Could you elaborate on the "bad ideas included" which apply here? Do you have a link to a write-up on the Factom flaws/bad idears?


That is clear to me. If no miners want to include such a transaction it will never get mined. This is why I proposed creating an address rather than OP_RETURN as I did read that some miners don't include them an longer. What about Eligius? How likely is it that miners will in future no longer include such 1 Satoshi transactions? I would have thought it is rather a matter of the fee maybe. I do agree that the proposed concept is still some kind of spam (in consider the expression a bit harsh, non the less) but my intention was to reduce it a lot. I considered e.g. 1 transaction a day, which can timestamp hundred thousands of documents to be acceptable. As people are already spamming regardless of some main devs oppinions, I was under the impression is was just something people want to do.
 &gt; Get something working and then start talking to miners about deploying it. As long as it's reasonable, you should be able to get Eligius and p2pool on board easily. Given time, you should be able to take advantage of merge-mining improvements for sidechains to get it mined the same way.
I am not sure if that is "easy enough" for me. If you could point out some good links about merged mining and the system you mentioned above, I could study it better. My main concern with ChronoBit was that is is not as easy to use as a Web-Service in it's current state. I am more than happy if we can establish a standard which does not bloat the blockchain at all.
@_date: 2015-03-27 23:03:33
I am currently working on a similar document. No political intentions so far. I have not gotten to read all of yours yet but I can see where you want to go.
 I have created a google sheet with many (hope the community helps filling the gaps) bitcoin timestamping concepts. Also a writeup of why we need a standard (spoiler, everyone does it differently now and I think by combining idears we could establish a standard which would be widely accepted). A standard would also mean that after the first person got a court to accept the method, it would be more likeley the next person would not have to bring in an expert. However. If today I do it with Proof of existence and you did it with another method, experts would have to be called again.
I will also propose an idear for a standard, which I will be interessted to get lots of feedback on.
Timestamping is such an exciting feature of Bitcoin!

Another thing: If you have the private key, you can do two things with it:
1. Import it to a wallet (Coinbase won't work here I guess, as it is not a wallet, at least not a real one)
2. Sweep the key into a wallet.
You would choose option 1 here as the pole guy would still have the private key as well, which means he could claim back his 0.045 BTC anytime. If you sweep a key however, you create a transaction from the address (derived from the private key) to an address which belongs to you. this means you (or your wallet SW) has created-ed the private key. Only you know it.
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:22:05

Yep fucked up! You are basically paying for the incompetence of some speculators, which have to speculate according to an agenda probably made by more incompetent people. Edit2 is just the worst. My example already qualifies for fucked up I guess. However, the people can slowly but somehow more directly than other places change that through peoples iniciatives.
I have to add another point. You are allowed to take out your pension money for self inhabited real-estate. Under normal circumstances I would not recommend to do this. The pension fund is also insurance against falling sick and/or death. So there is payouts to next of kin which could help pay motage. So if you go to the limit and use all of that fund for real estate, you might have a problem in case of something unecpected. But if the interrest rates keep falling, it might still be better to have less mortage (very low rates in Switzerland currently) and pay fewer interesst instead of having your pension money vanishing slowly. In that case filling the insurance hole privateley has to be considered.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:18:54
The private key is a piece of information you need to make Bitcoins take of from your address to another one. the address is what you can make public without being at risk that someone else can send your coins. Kind of like with Email. If your share your address it doesn't mean someone can send mails from your account.
In Bitcoin this is a little different again. The address can actually be derived of the private key. This means saving the private key alone is enough to check a balance (agian, the address can be calculated from the private key) and spend the coins.

Also beware, that the number of confirmations needed to be sure to not be reversed largely depends on the amount you receive as well. For someone paying you $ 1 Billion (yes let's assume an insanely large amount to settle over the Bitcoin network) it would be feasible to bribe some miners for $0.5 Billion to secretly mine on an other chain for x blocks. If you get payed for a coffee that is nothing you should worry about. If people don't want to pay the coffee they could just walk out of the restaurant without paying you. Much easier then reversing history.
Game theory can tell you the exact amount, miners would do this fore in order to profit more than the block rewards. It gets complicated if you include all factors but it comes down to this: No PoW miner wants to invest a lot of work in a chain which will not be the longest one after all. So even when you have lot's of hashpower, this is a risky stunt to try. Therefore you would need to offer the miner(s) some serious money, probably lot's more than what their expected payout would be. Unless of course you want to pay them also if they do not succeed. Then you only need to offer more than what they can expect by honest mining.

I have a question regarding this, after sleeping a night:
Initially when setting up the t/n scheme, do you have to have the private key for the bitcoin address to make the n shards? Or is it even possible to derive the address directly from the shards? So would it even be possible to have let's say 7 shards created on seven devices, and then join forces to create the deriving bitcoin address. This would truly mean that the real private key would never have to be constructed at all and therefore increasing security significantly.
Would be happy if anyone could answer this.

For other who are interessted. I just played around a bit with apps I already have installed. bitWallet (which I liked before already) acctualy has this feature. If you go to options you can set "Background Alerts" to on and configure which addresses (watch only or others) shall be checked. The interval can even be set e.g. 15min. The app has to open in the background for this to work but its more or less exactly what I wanted as it is much easier for several people to set this up. On BCI others would have to all create their own wallet only to import a watch only and set alerts. bitWallet allows to just scan the address and turn alerts on.

I think on older versions Mycelium, warned in red that there was no seed backup created yet, if the wallet was a fresh install and first wallet was created. It doesn't seem to do that any longer. True I thought this was so awesome of the wallet to do this. Case like this could have been prevented.
@_date: 2015-02-28 15:35:57
Don't do it. Maybe you think you are the only one choosing these exact words. (Exerpt from Davinci Code or Fifty Shades of Gray \s) However, there are people mining for private keys with wathever scentences they find on the net and in google books. Therefore you are much better served if you let the wallet choose the seedkey and give you the mnemonic passphrase. A good wallet will take several sources of entropy and mix them together (random generator, mouse moovements, girosensor, gps location history, ...). I think in any case better than a seed made of real words...even if the sentence does not exist anywhere else in writing.

No, no. the opposite. The software is kept in a way that whenever possible, you don't change anything which isn't needed, which could cause different versions to accept different transactions / blocks. So the code change which fixed the bug was released, because it was needed or desirable but the client was still built to not ever spend the genesis coins.

So how do I ensure when I show the extended public key to someone he will pay to a new address? Won't this person be able to see all addresses controlled, thus making it worse than a "classic" paper wallet privacy wise?

Yes it is. Can confirm. I have synch between my iOS Mycelium and my Android Mycelium. I must admit I have not yet tried sub HD accounts and if they automatically synch. They should however.
Edit: Beware, not all HD wallets are fully compatible from scratch. e.g. Hive seems to use a different hierarchical structure than Mycelium. so you can use the same seed, but different addresses are generated. Not user if they ever collide but I just won't use them for the time being.

It is available now. I don't exactly know how the auto updating would be supposed to work. I always switch off all auto update features.
I don't think it is crucial to have a outgoing bandwidth cap through bitcoind or qt. This can easily be set up externally. It is way more important crucial parts are in there. I think most of the dev community (not part of it) thinks likewise. Resources are few and a bandwidth cap does not seem to be something which needs to be in the application itself. My node doesn't need much bandwidth anyway, at least as of now.

No, as long as you control the keys (not a wallet on an exchange) you are safe. When spending after the possible chain split make sure to broadcast two transactions at the same time. One on Chain A with the amount going to "Chris" and one on chain B back to yourself. This only needs to be done if there is no built in replay protection.

Bitcoin "issuing" is done to simulate how natural resources are "issued". Meaning there is a finite amount and it gets harder and harder to find new resources. Also it gets harder to find them the more people engage in the gold-digging.
The halving after each x blocks is is simpler than doing it continuously. Halving of a binary number is much simpler and more exact than doing any intermediate steps. There is no arguments on proper rounding.

At least something like Bitcoin will succeed as the next generation is not going to wait several days or a couple weeks for international transactions. On top there will be uses where instant settlement is required, e.g. ship after payment. PayPal and other Government currency online IOU token system, just don't do that, plus they have higher fees.

I think this is a good use case for a sharded backup (m/n) like Armory features it. I would love a BIP which acrually allows sharded mnemonic passphrases on top of the regular BIP 39. However, noone else seems to find this important. Not even Electrum features M/N backups (unless if course you want to use a command line tool to do it manually.
Also multi-sig address could be a good option for such an amount.

A gamble. I was out of gox for over a year already when it went down. But because transaction malleability was/is a real problem and others like Bitstamp had halted BTC payouts as well I thought that there was a fair chance that BTC payouts would resume at some point.
Without any thorough anaylis, I still think that a lot of funds from GOX will never be claimed as there were so many money-laundering accounts from SR there. Lot's of BTC were probably already in some kind of claimable state when GOX suddenly started to ask for account validation. Lot's of money-launderers are not going to claim their money back, I guess.
Edit: I only invested what I could afford to loose. And luckily, unlike others, I still got the GOX coins when they were still transferable internally. I didn't want to be left with double 3rd party trust. So all my Bitcoin IOUs are now "safe" on GOX itself and I have screenshots and mails to prove it to them directly. Alltough maybe being still in the BTC builder boat would't be that bad cause the guy is still around and filing claims for his clientele as soon as claims can be filed.

Probably equally important to you might be that it is a push system. It means if I pay you in bitcoin I push a transaction to you. You can never just deduct anything from me, unlike with credit card info. You on the other hand can be sure to not have to deal with charge backs. The same applies to you. You will push a refund to a customer, there is no way he can pull it of you.
Just wanted to mention that as your post includes some info that you have been scammed online before. If someone pays in Bitcoin it is like cash in advance.

could be an option?
Or put the PW to your wallet and how it can be found in your will. However, you would have to trust the notary or trust that noeone finds this will before you die and spends all your coins.
As you seem to be running a full node already, consider Armory Wallet. It allows you to make M/N backups. You can give some shards to trusted relatives and advice them to give the shards to your kids in case anything happens. The relatives/friends will not be able to spend the coins on their own, however. This is the main advantage with M/N. You have redundancy (e.g. 3/6) but a single shard will never be enough to spend the coins. So you can leave these shards with semi-trusted entities.

One of the maybe easiest things you could try is to connect an external monitor or beamer to the thing. If only the screen is broken, this could well work. If it doesn't work just like that try booting the notebook and blindly loggng in (wait long enough, type your pw and hit enter, depending on OS maybe some other steps like ctrl+alt+del beforemlogin). Maybe the second monitor can only be activated once you are logged in. Maybe you have to try fn+F4 as well. Your keyboard should indicate it with a little screen symbol. Now if you are very lucky, your second screen will show the same as your first directly. if it shows only your desktop background, try right clicking it and changeing settngs. Best of luck. If that doesn't help, you have some more options. 
1. Try booting from amlife CD, e.g. Bart-PE or maybe Ubuntu. Does the screen do the same? How about with the second monitor connected?
2. Take out the hard disk and read it on another pc. There are special devices for connecting in-built hds to a dock which connects to another computer by usb.
Edit: Really no backup? Are you sure? Check the spots where you would keep it. If you can access the HD google for where Multibit keeps your wallet file.

@_date: 2015-02-23 20:08:28
**The Node** The node is the first layer of security in the Bitcoin network.
It accepts, verifies and relays transactions and blocks.
Person A wants to send to B. They create a transaction stating that they want this amount to be transferred from A to B and sign it.
Digital signatures - unlike manual signatures - are specific for the signed content.
Only A can create this signature not B. The node checks all the signatures and relays transactions if they are properly signed. They do the same for blocks (aka pages in the bitcoin ledger). Blocks also contain signatures but they also contain a block hash (random looking very large number which is in fact determined by certain factors). The node checks of the node hash is a valid hash and is of the right difficulty.The nodes will also check this hash and relay the block to all other nodes.  
The node can also be used to verify incoming payments and broadcast transactions. Transactions are just requests to change the ledger. If they are valid they will be relayed by other nodes and included into a block by a miner.   
**The Miners** Miners take part in the race to find the next block hash. Calculating a hash is something which just requires a certain amount of work. Therefore "proof of work". By combining this with a difficulty factor, it creates a very smart puzzle, kind of like a Sudoku. Any six year old could verify it is solved correctly given instructions, no matter what the difficulty of the Sudoku was. Miners take part in solving the Sudokus and if they find a correct one, they get rewarded with all transaction fees plus the newly minted coins, aka coinbase.  
The miner needs a node to broadcast his block.  
So there is no coinbase incentive for nodes. However, there are still incentives to run one. If you want to use bitcoin like what is called "trustless" p2p you have to have your own node to verify a transaction. No one else can fool you if a transaction is incoming.

I don't agree. A "classical" paper wallet can at least be used to collect payments directly. A HD mnemonic seed is a backup, but can by itself not be used as a wallet at all.

Just wanted to chime in and tell you that there are other ways to to get your BTC without downloading the entire chain. A 2011 wallet.dat is most likley not encrypted. If you open it with a text editor you may be able to extract the private keys. You can then either import or swipe them into a lightweight wallet.

I can't judge if this is the trusted one. However, you probably want version 2.0 now not 1.9. Normally you can get .deb files earlier than via ppa, at least this is my experience. e.g. Bitcoin Core 0.10 was about a week later via ppa than .deb package.

Yes. And address I own but coins can be spent by API through ATM. As the ATM is a prototype it will always print a receipt and tell the visitor that coins were sent, even when it is empty and can not send. I therefore don't want it to run empty. I am also interested how many visitors actually buy BTC there.

Armory is the best wallet! Period!
The best part about it is how you can learn about Bitcoin with it. Yes it's not started in 15 seconds on iOS and has a Win XP looking interface. I like it. One of the best features which no other wallet has and is probably heavily under-rated: The question marks with the call outs that teach you all about Bitcoin and Armory.

@_date: 2015-02-23 16:39:19
Yep this is how it is supposed to work.  
When you prepare a transaction your online wallet will prepare the unsigned transaction and the cold wallet will then know which keys to use to sign. The transaction can then be broadcast from the online machine. The idea is that your keys never touch the "Internet" or a possibly "contaminated" system but still remain useful.

Client decides. However FIFO is best as you will need to pay lower fees as most miners prefor to move old coins (unspent transaction outputs) to prevent spam.
Priority of a transaction depends on size, amount, miner fee and age of the coins
Wallets like e.g. Armory give you features to define which coins are used. You can even lock some coins to be used. It's called coin control.
@_date: 2015-02-08 14:04:38
Only problem with breadwallet is that if you are on a WiFi which does not allow you to use the port it needs, it sucks. Once had to restore from seed into another wallet as it didn't work.

Just to make it cristal clear: It is possible to construct the pub-key like that and derive the address from it without ever constructing the priv-key.
If that is the case this scheme is so awesome.
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:56:42
You can keep track of all the funds no problem. As the way you hand out addresses is deterministic you know how to keep track of addresses and balances all the time and most importantly you have one key which is a master for all keys you need to spend the bitcoins. You can also create a watch-only masterkey to let e.g. your accountant keep track as well, but without him being able to spend a penny.
These wallets also allow for sub accounts. All properties are also available for sub accounts. All sub accounts can also be saved by the same master key.
The other participants won't be able to tell from an address which other addresses you control.
Kind of smart, no?

yes it is. Bitcoin is a lot about game theory. It seems you will always be several order of magnitude better off to do mining instead of guessing.
However, some people watch a lot of addresses which are created with poor entropy. Blockchain.info's address generation was like this for several hours late last year. Someone took the coins....and gave them back. However, if someone els had taken them...
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:56:58

The problem you describe is somewhat real. So if you use Hive on iOS and use Mycelium with the same seed, the wallets seem to be out of synch. However both have the same seed.
However, if you would just find a seed and wouldn't know which structure was used, you would just go down the tree and assume that no address was used further down if none was used 20 steps down or so. I don't know what tools exist specifically to recover coins out of such seeds. If there isn't one it will most likeley be created.
Tip for now: When you write down the seed, write down the wallet used plus its version. That's how I do it.

Yes agreed. You can crate a hash tree and then include it. My main point is that every concept/service does it differently. This will cause trouble and inefficiencies in the future. Just imagine explaining e.g. in court how you created your own hash tree and how the court can verify it.
I personally don't care what the standard looks like exactly. I just combined some idears in this post and try to get feedback. What I do care about is that we can reach some kind of standard which is followed by lots of people so our life is much easier shall we ever have to produce the proof.

Why would selling on darkleaks twice be difficult. You might just have to alter one line spacing of a document and the algo will probably fail to recognize that it is the same as before. From the article I wouldn't even gather that the SW checks at all if this exact same data was sold before.

The main problem is that you will need a computer to crate the address out of the private key. The hashing required (SHA-256, RIPE160) is hard to do with pen and paper. If you want to know more about address generation check this blog post. Generally a very very good blog:
Edit: There once was a guy here on who cut out all 2048 words for mnemonc and crated his hd seed by drawing them from a bucket.
Edit2: A lot of people use 16 sided dice for this sort of thing. gets you 256 bits of entropy way faster than flipping coins.
@_date: 2015-02-28 16:43:31
If you don't that is fine. Don't take any offence please. Just wanted to prevent tears. Then I don't understand why you dont just do it like someone else posted here a wile back. Print all 2048 words, cut the words out and throw them in a bucket. Draw 12 words.  
If you have your entropy alrady, [this]( or [this]( might help.  
Again, just wanted to prevent accidents, no offence ment.
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:38:25
Sha-256 and RIPE160 are both used if you want to generate and address out of a private key. Therefore you would need both of these functions to create a paper wallet without using a computer. That's why I pointed it out.

After the key export bitWAllet on iOS has been very handy for me. Of course most wallets support key imports.
Beware, your key will not be backed up by the standard backup of the newly chosen wallet. So it is best to transfer to a new wallet, preferably to a HD wallet. This meens you creat one seed and all the key you will be using in the future (within this wallet) will be backed up with the seed as well.

It is funny you would say that. I ah e spent a lot of time thinking about paralles between e.g. GMO-tech and Bitcoin. I wondered if e.g. on reddit the relevant subs were also filled with sceptics who post all day about the dangers... Maybe. havn't found the right sub yet but at least in there is not much going on in this direction.
I think it is very important to discuss the downsides of technology as well, however, the general publc often dscusses these things based on main stream media content.
I give you an example. In 2008 i worked in the agrar sector and in my country there was a (non-public i.e. nobody cared from the public) discussion about polyploidisation of fodder grass and wheter this should be allowed in "bio"-production (bio==organic). This is already done wideley since the 60ies. It basically means you bread a plant and once its good you make it polyploid i.e. afterwards it has multiple copies f it's genome. Normally plants get more stubborn, pathogen resistant and they reach a higher yeald. So now the bio-federation was discussing if they want to do it as well. Turns out they voted yes, with the restriction that the chemical used for the polyploidisation had to be extracted from organically grown plants. ;-)
So technically these plants are GMOs and even dirty ones as you dont't even control how many copies of the genome will be in there once you are done. Compare this to e.g. taking one resistance gene out of one strain and putting it into another. No one gives a fuck about polyploidisation and what the effects in ecosystems is... F one gene is copy-pasted the whole world knows what this is about and has strong oppinions.

Stable, probably not. Against what? Hamburger index? USD?
The volatility of bitcoin seems to be getting smaller. I know it may not look like that but see how regularly we had higher peaks in volatility.
The idea of the "pipe-dream" is that as it gets more adopted, more network effect kicks in. It should also be more distributed, more used and thus create a more stable environment. If e.g. a big holder of bitcoins like e.g. the bearwhale decides to let go a few k of them, the price may drop quite a bit. These coins are then in the hands of many current and new users.
If that will work out in the end I don't know. I can live with quite some swings, as it's superior properties outweigh that volatility. This is especially true with much of the net growths over the past years is also brought by volatility.

Would love to buy it but the shipping would be very expensive with the insurance required. Also I would need to know a bit more about the history of the coin (how did you get it?), would need to know its address  and see a photo of it with a piece of paper with your username on it. The usual stuff. Escrow would have to be used....

When you merge all your unspent outputs, and then pay for something somewhere it is much easier to track all the previous addresses and your financial history.

After all the BitcoinXT stuff, he publicly stated that he met [Craig Steven Wright]( talked to him, was convinced he was Satoshi and also had him sign a line out of his mind with one of the keys for a very early block on a fresh laptop. Other members of the bitcoin community did that too. The guy also stated that he would sign a message for the public. That's why these people then agreed to help his social media campaign-coming out. He never did. This is generally referred to in this community as "bamboozled". Actually quite a foul reaction to ridicule somebody becoming deceived and being a victim out of that already.
The general though is that this CSW guy is not Satoshi. I am not as convinced as the masses. There is basically a drama/conspiracy theory around this. Google for Dave Kleinmann, Joseph Vaughn-Perling, Tulip Trust... You can find some articles.

Good I mentioned it. Im Mycelium go to settings and choose backup wallet. Write down these 12 words sn keep them somewhere safe. This is you backup in case your mobile gets lost or defective. Also this backup format is compatible with many bitcoin wallets. The wallet should actually urge you to do it, at the latest after you received your first transaction.
This backup will be good for all addresses you create with this wallet in the future. It's called a hirarchical deterministic (HD) wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-08 08:40:21
Yes it has the preventative effect that I can see when the balance runs low on the ATM and I need to refill it and empty the cash out.
If I understand you correctly you would have wanted to see if someone tries to sign for your address with an correct key, i.e. breaking into your address? I don't think that makes a lot of sense either such a tx would not be relayed by nodes and does not actually cause a threat to your money.

I think you should do exactly as you have palnned. For the offline computer Armory does not need much ram and such. Easiest is to use a cheap netbook. Have a good backup scheme in place: Whatt happens when you die? Whatt happens when your house burns down? ...
Check this:
And maybe this:
And of course check the armory section in BTC talk, once its back up. Version 0.9 will bemout soon. The current test build on bitcoinarmory.com works just fine however. Do some training on all the features before you fire all your funds at a wallet.

It is a huge risk and a huge chance. I am pretty sure one Swiss bank will be the first and take the leap of faith and the one that does that has higher changes then risks. Look how some Swiss banks had reputation issues lately, also internationally. That could all be glued back together if Bitcoin failed. You can never buy back that head start later though. And the upward potential is enormous especially when the first Swiss bank starts with that. They can already make shitloads of money just by insider trading on their announcement. that would maybe even be legal as Bitcoin is unregulated as of now. Don't take me for granted on that though...
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:41:31
Should be possible to prove whether someone did an inside job/the bank was hacked or whether I have actually authenticated the transaction with my 2 factor authentication for e-banking? It would just mean that they have to set up the wallet that in a way that they can not access it themselves unless a judge rules so. If that is not the case a wallet would not be so interesting.

I don't think processing number of transactions has any direct correlation with hashpower. The question is rather, how much hashpower is needed in order to make the blockchain riddle too hard to crack/compromise for any one entity. I think as of now it seems almost impossible to aquire another 10 petahash in order to get 50%, even with your own powerplant and chip factory. And your operation has to be so large that when ot goes online you have 51% of what the hashpower will be then.

I think more hashrate drives interrest to some extent. It makes the network more secure and therefore each coin more secure. Now you can tell people that you need the 500 best known supercomputers of the world x times to do an attack. Next year you might need them 20x times to do an attack. These numbers drive adoption. (I think I saw an article at 40 THash/sec that you need those 500 supercomputers 8 times do have the same hashingpower as the network and therefore could to a 51% attack). It becomes less likeley every day that someone with enough funding can hurt bitcoin by putting together some massive stealth miner production in order to turn them all on at once.

I would not lend or borrow in BTC. Also it is not a good unit of account right now. Would you want to lend or borrow gold, silver, copper? No but you would want to use it as a store of value. And if you could send it around the world within minutes you would use gold as a payment system, maybe. It's designed to be non-inflationary, thats why it is different and that is a big driver of the adoption. If it ever levels of and stabilizes that mght be a different story... still a long way to go.

Hi DanSovereign
The network does something very useful with that "calculation power". I creates a riddle which is becoming harder and harder to break as the network grows. As long as the riddle isn't broken, the ledger of all transactions stays true. This way the decentralized network protects from outside attacker whilst being completely open (open source).
The miners don't primarily mine for Bitcoins. The make sure the time stamps of transactions become hard to forge. The Block rewards are there as an incentive to build the initial network. After about 100 years the network will have to sustain itself by transaction fees only.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:26:44

@_date: 2013-12-19 12:43:54
Good point. OT is not trustless as Bitcoin is. You have to trust the issuer of a currency or title. It integrates very well with Bitcoin, though as a Bitcoin-backed title/currency (Let's call it the OT-Bitcoin for now) can be issued in a basically trustless system. Federated servers build a voting pool, so the issuer cannot just do fractional reserve banking or things like that with the Bitcoins unless it is specified in the currency contract. And yes in OT you can basically trade anything against anything without the need for a currency. I can e.g. repair your boat and you can pay me with 200 fish. As I don't want all fish at onece you can issue them in OT and give them to me. I have 200 fish and you are 200 into the negative. I can trade these fish in our village for other things (on or off OT) and someone you don't know might come to you with a cheque for 10 fish. You can accept the cheque and give him 10 fish. You are only 190 into the negative after. So you can safely and securely barter without a currency. Currencies still come in handy, though. We can even have a scripted contract with several exit conditions and so on. Very, very powerful.

Edit: Maybe once it hits Steam. There is already someone offering Steam gaming with Bitcoins right?

Check out Open-Transactions/ Moneychanger
There is even a way to integrate it with SEPA being worked on. OT will do to economy/makets what Bitcoin does to money.

Plus you can make m/n backups. e.g. make a paperbackup where any m of n fragments can restore the wallet. And you can even make these printer safe, so even if someone hacks into your printer the coins will not get stolen.
Edit: No need to download the whole blockchain to store. Just to spend and watch your funds with a watching only wallet. However, you can also just use blockchain.info for watching, if you trust that site.
