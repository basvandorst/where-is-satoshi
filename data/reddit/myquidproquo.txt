[There is a difference between mining nodes and full-nodes.](
Full nodes can process and relay transactions and have a queue of transactions to validate. Each individual node has its own independent queue, so there is no global pool of transactions.
Lots of people run full nodes. You should too :)
Miners just want to find blocks, of course they need a queue of transactions also, but it's a totally different job. 
If most miners were shut down blocks would just take longer to be mined. The transactions would start filling the pool of unverified transactions of each individual node. Some nodes might decide to drop transactions...
But for a particular transaction to be removed from all the nodes of the network...Well, it would be like making some photo "disappear" from the internet. You know it's possible, just not likely.
Eventually the mining difficulty would readjust as some people pointed out. Mining would become easier.

Content from the original post on FB:




Ray, based on all what has been discussed in the first 60 pages of the book, considering that the US implemented mostly stimulative policy policy 1, policy 2, and is now in the midst of policy 3 - tax cuts and direct money transfers to people for spending, but because not too much deflationary and austerity policies were rolled out - debt restructurings - we are still having quite a large amount of debt left. It was ok to service it under 0% rates, but now when rates are going up, what policy in your view should be a better response? Cutting deficit? Reducing spending? How do we transition from beautiful deleveraging to normalization without pushing on a string?


Because the dollar size of our obligations (to service debts and meet non-debt obligations for pensions and health care) is large and will grow at a rate that is faster than the incomes to meet them, I expect borrowing and printing money will both grow, which will weaken the dollar and eventually diminish its role as a reserve currency. Said differently, the soundness of our finances is weak.

You have to open at least one channel and it might suffice. But it might be in your interest to open more than one in order to get a better chance to route your payment with optimal or no fees. 
Imagine your Ma, Pa, bro, friends are already on the lightning network. You can open a channel between you and your Ma and chances are that you can make payments to Pa, bro and friends and anyone on the LN without the need for any more channels. 
Take a look at this graph of the LN running on the bitcoin testnet. 
See how the nodes are highly connected with each other? By opening just **one** channel you might be able to make payments to all the rest of the network.

I believe you are looking too much into the technology and not so much into the goal of the technology. 
It just turns out that for now the best way to achieve this goal of distributed ledger with autonomous issuing is a blockchain database.
This might not be the case in the future and Bitcoin can adapt if it needs to.
As an example: People are still using smtp for sending emails. We sure could design better than that. But the goal of sending digital mail was fulfilled and we just designed around that to make it better and more secure...
We can eventually, in the future, remove smtp altogether but we would probably still use the same addresses (abc

My leftist views are:

* Global public healthcare complemented by private healthcare for people who can pay for faster/"premium" service.
* Global public education complemented by private education for people who can pay for faster/"premium" service.
* Gun control. As an European I just can't understand why this is an issue. There was never a school shooting in my country. Not in the last year not in the last decade nor ever...Never a public shooting like the ones in cinemas, streets, etc...I just can't understand why this is even an issue.
More to the right:
* I generally believe in free market.
* I believe people should be able to amass wealth.
Regarding healthcare:
* I just recently became a dad and it never crossed my mind to pay for anything regarding the medical care. It is a great feeling.
* As in the case of gun control I have a hard time understanding why someone who is unlucky to have an appendicitis should have thousands of dollars in healthcare bills.

@_date: 2019-03-29 22:12:10
Waiting for more confirmations doesn't protect you at all against a miner adding double spend transactions, miners increasing their mining reward or inflating Bitcoin.
The thing is: The **only** way to know that the rules are being followed is to run the software yourself and validate every single transaction from the beginning. That's it! That's the only way, there is no way around it! 
If you're not doing that you are trusting miners.
You might find that trusting miners is a good compromise for you. You would trade it for the convenience of on-boarding everyone on LN. Fair enough! 
But what if all people begin thinking like you. What if running a full node becomes so costly that people just think "Forget it, I'm not running this shit. Let the miners run it.". 
What if running a full node becomes more costly than the Bitcoins you have? 
If nobody validates the transactions, only miners, how would this model be any different than a bank?
A lot of people are genuinely worried about increasing block size. It's a real thing! If people stopped running full-nodes Bitcoin would fail. And that gets precedence over LN on-boarding.
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:23:09
If you don't run your full-node, do not validate your transactions yourself you are trusting miners. 
How would you know if miners decided to add a double spend transaction? Or increase mining reward? Miners would effectively decide the rules. How would that be different than a bank?
Remember, miners serve the network they do not define the network or its rules!
EDIT: This is not a minor point! This is the whole point! The idea of storing all the transactions since the beginning is so that anyone can validate the whole chain. What good would it be if only miners were able to validate all that stuff anyway? Giving all that power to miners would make Bitcoin useless.

That's not how it works. 
There's no warning, there's no recourse. 
My node would just reject the block, black list the nodes that gave that block and life would go on. My node would patiently wait for a valid block...
Meanwhile the miner who created the invalid block just burned thousands of dollars in electricity on a naive attempt to full the network! Nice work!
That is, of course, if people **do run the full validating nodes**. As long as people keep running their nodes they can be sure that they are safe and all the transactions and all the blocks they accept are valid.
On the other hand if you accept whatever miners give you...Well...Then you get whatever miners decide to give you... 
- Miners want to inflate the currency? Sure they can.
- Miners want to insert a double spend? Yep...
- Miners want to insert invalid transactions? Carry on...
- Miners want to change the rules and mine 300GB blocks? Sure!




Ask yourself? If all comes down to the miners why they don't just change the rule? It's a simple change...Why not just do it? Are they just being cool about it?
The simple answer is this: They can't. Because the network would reject those blocks and they would have burned all that energy for nothing.

Bitcoin is a digital currency.
It’s different from other currencies because you don’t need any central authority (bank) to transact.
Also it doesn’t have a central bank that can create money. It’s supply increases over time in a predictable algorithmic way which no one can change. The supply increase reduces (halves) every 4 years.

@_date: 2019-11-21 09:57:38
As u/art_of_bug said users should be able to validate all the blockchain. It looks like that's impossible in your model.
See 
Also full-nodes can already remove old blocks after they've been validated by enabling pruning. The blockchain total size is not that important as long as you can validate the blocks quickly.
@_date: 2019-03-30 10:11:09
Of course! That's my point! If you trust miners! ��
In fact if you trust miners you can get rid of my node, your node, everyone's node. 
In fact you could just get rid of the whole blockchain! Why keep that junk from 10 years ago??
It wouldn't be trustless but it would be tremendously efficient!! It would be just like...Well...Just like a bank.
EDIT: Once again, miners have shown multiple times that they are completely open to a blocksize increase. Miners have voted for a blocksize increase in Segwit2x. If full validating nodes are so useless why won't you just talk to the miners and convince them to change that simple setting? They have the power to do it. Just do it.
You seem to like analogies: My node is like a soldier. Alone is completely useless, as you point out! 10.000 of them make a difference! By increasing the block size instead of 10.000 we might get only 5.000. Do you think 10.000 soldiers are as effective as 5.000?
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:48:28

No, you're overstating miners importance. 
Once again: If they are so important why don't they just make the rule change and get over with it? 
Actually you should be really upset with miners!
- They have an opportunity to make a simple change.
- They've shown that they support that simple change.
- That change would make them more money by allowing Bitcoin to scale.
- That change would end all the debate around this issue once and for all!
- As you've said. The battle would continue with the generals, fuck the soldiers.
Why would anyone be upset with Bitcoin Core or whatever. Just convince the miners. They've shown that they want the change.

After Segwit approval miners decided that they would increase the blocksize to 2MB. They called the change Segwit2x. The proposal had around 90% of miners support...Since bitcoin core wouldn't accept the change they got a new team of developers to deliver the code.
Once again, ask yourself: A simple change! 90% of miners approval. A new team of developers. Why did it fail?

Disclaimer: It's 3AM in here I might not be at my full capacity :)
Your example is interesting and brings light to some complex issues that usually get simplified for the sake of keeping this conversation manageable!
Anyway, the way to see this is that this is a totally voluntary network! No one is forcing anyone to run any particularly set of rules. You can just run what you like. This is the case for nodes and miners!
You as a user and someone who has some Bitcoins run your full node voluntarily on your own self interest so you can validate all the transactions and guarantee that the money you're transacting is really valid. Also you check if there are no double spends, that all signatures are valid, all blocks are valid and that no one is inflating or cheating the system.
Once again the primary reason to run a node is your own self-interest! If you don't run a full node and don't validate all the transactions you are **trusting someone**. 
This is important, not because we are paranoid but because this is the fundamental reason for having Bitcoin in the first place. To remove the trusted third-parties from the system. Don't take my word for it. Go ahead and [read it from the white paper](
Now for the important part:


You seem to have forgotten to provide an *evil* and *honest* node definition. And that's probably for good reason as I don't think we could come up with a definition for what constitutes *evil* or *honest* nodes. Nodes have no moral values I guess, they just follow the chain that complies to the rules they have written in code. 
So we can disregard the *honest* or *evil* concepts completely.
But you are completely right when you say that your 10.000 nodes wouldn't change anything either way. This is a voluntary network after all, you can't force your view on anyone else!
The question is: What good are your own 10.000 nodes if there's only you behind all of them? Are you going to trade money only with yourself?
*Honest* or *evil* it is irrelevant. What's relevant is what the community voluntarily accept as... well... "the money WE accept". 
Change the rules and you have a completely different community. You might convince someone to follow your own new rules and form a new community. That's what happened with Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, etc...
Now back to the big question:


Once again you can't strictly force them. But by forming an economic community miners are *kind of forced* (as in highly incentivized) to build blocks in the chain that the community accepts. 
Think about it: What would miners gain by mining blocks for the network of 10.000 nodes you've created? Nothing! If only you accept that kind of money why would they burn all that energy? Just to buy things from you?
Miners follow rules! They follow the money...They follow the relevant economic communities. 
They don't define any rule!
Now if the community weakens...If people stopped running full nodes...Well, then miners would just mine whatever it would be best for them.

Ledger is your private key �� 
The analogy holds, it’s like having two identical keys for your house.
There’s no “money” in the ledger, just a key to the money on the blockchain, so there’s no synchronization needed.

The largest chain wins.
So in that case you have two incompatible chains (A and B) until eventually another block is mined on top of one of those chains.
As an example, if the new block is mined on top of chain A all the nodes that were accepting chain B will ignore the previous block and return to following chain A as it is the largest. This operations is called a reorg.

I understand that you might not be one conspiracy theorist but in this particular case you are showing signs of conspiracy thinking.
You sowed no evidence at all, just a vague reference to authority (the top meteorologist). 
These are typical of conspiracy theories.
I concede to the fact that this was all politicized in the US, but that dosn’t make it less real. 
That’s just a very unfortunate fact that makes people choose sides based on political views instead of the actual overwhelming body of evidence and scientific consensus surrounding this issue.
I still would like to see any research, reference or even the statement of the top meteorologist if you care to give them.

Usually, when you create an address to receive a payment that address is a representation (hash) of a public key. 
So the information that is stored in the blockchain **is not** the public key itself and no one can derive it from its representation (hash).
**Only when you spend your coins you provide the public key and the signature.**
The computer validating the transaction will check if the public key you have provided matches the representation (hash) that is stored in the blockchain and only then check if the signature is also correct.
So if you‘re afraid that eventually in the (hopefully) very distant future someone can derive private keys from public keys you can follow the best practice of never reusing addresses. That way you will not have any money stored in a “public key representation” for which you’ve already revealed the actual public key.

When you want to store or send money to someone you probably use a bank account. You trust the bank to: 
- store the amount of money you have in a database.
- confirm that your transaction is legitimate.
- remove the money from your account and put it on the receiver account.
Bitcoin has a similar database. But instead of being privately in a bank it is public. So you can (independently and without trusting no one) download it, check all transactions that ever happened and agree that the current state of the database is valid. 
When new transactions come in you validate those and store them on your local database.
Every user does exactly the same and there’s a mechanism so everyone can agree on what the current state is so instead of trusting a bank no one needs to trust no one.
In addition to that, as there is no central bank, there’s a mechanism for issuing new Bitcoin into circulation.
Computers try to solve puzzles that are so hard to solve that you only can solve them by randomly trying combinations. 
Once a computer finds a solution it broadcast to everyone else and everyone else can, once again independently, confirm that a solution was found. The computer who finds a solution claims some new Bitcoins to himself. There’s no other way to create new Bitcoin.
Once more computers join the party to try and solve puzzles the puzzles become harder and harder to solve in order to maintain a constant number of Bitcoins created over time.
The number of Bitcoins that puzzle solvers can claim for themselves reduces by half every 4 years so Bitcoin becomes scarcer and scarcer over time. 
There will only exist 21 million Bitcoin ever created.

Of course they are entitled to an opinion. I said that in the original post. 
But the agreement was not an opinion.They said that they were going to signal for segwit and then do the 2mb hardfork. Even decided on the date. Not against blocksize increase if developers and miners believe it's best for Bitcoin and agree to do that. This was not the case with this agreement.

Just want to add that this was probably the biggest attack on Bitcoin yet. Bitcoin as a community won against a lot of big corporations.

Currently there’s really no motivation for people to use Bitcoin on a day-to-day basis.

The amount of bureaucracy regarding these issues never ceases to amaze me.
So the **SMSG** advises **ESMA** that they should consider EU’s **MiFID II** but recognizes that **ESMA** does not itself have the power to do it since it would require a change in the **Level 1 Text** of **MiFID II** so they are urged to consult with the **European Banking Authority** and take this up with the **European Commission**.
So to make things easier they decide to divide cryptocurrencies into:
* Utility tokens
* Non-transferable utility tokens
* Asset tokens
They put the **utility tokens** on the **MiFID II** bucket and forget about **non-transferable utility tokens**
Now for the **asset tokens** there is a special treat in store. Someone has to decide if they are **financial instruments** for **MiFID** purposes and **Market Abuse Regulation** or a **transferable security** for purposes of **Prospectus Regulation**.
Did I get it right?
EDIT: I'm just hoping that they get the **Level 1 Text** right. Just imagine what would happen if they escalated that Text to **Level 2**.

OK, that could help.
My main problem is with exchanges. They have listed a coin with no support calling it "Bitcoin Cash" which generates a lot of confusion for newcomers. 
In the process the price of BCH gets inflated giving it the appearance that it is the new cool thing when it has almost no support from miners, developers, etc...
I guess exchanges should be viewed as major actors and they should be more responsible in the process. 
I'm looking from the outside but it seems that there's some communication lacking between the major actors in Bitcoin.

This is why I don't believe in Segwit2x...It feels like miners are deciding to prove that they own Bitcoin. They believe that they can even decide who codes bitcoin.
If we can prove them wrong:
1. developers will be able to code the best for the protocol as they always did.
2. miners will be able to mine in their own self-interest like they always did.
Miners shouldn't be deciding who codes or what gets coded.

The blocksize debate is over. That change was already made. It's the BCash hardfork. [The fees are higher than BTC]( but that's ok too...
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:18:52
This BCH situation has proven that regardless of developer's and miner's overwhelming support a tiny minority can always hard fork for whatever reason, force exchanges to list new coins and cause a lot of confusion along the way.
This means that these protocol updates should be better managed and carefully planned. They should take into account the opinion and economic interests of all the actors (developers, miners, exchanges, users, etc).
An agreement like this that didn't take into account the technical concerns of the developer team is bad for Bitcoin. As it would be bad for Bitcoin if the developer team decided for a unilateral PoW change.
Furthermore it seems that there is little to gain now from this blocksize increase versus the risk involved.
Lets stop pointing fingers and use this time to try to build longterm healthy relationships between all the parts involved in order for these protocol updates to go smoothly.
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:36:43

Miners verify transactions and get paid in Bitcoin for that.The amount of Bitcoin paid is one of the consensus rules. If they now can do agreements to push new consensus rules and everyone is fine with it there is nothing stopping them from changing other rules like the number of Bitcoins issued.

3 could happen but seems really unrealistic because:
- something orders of magnitude better would have to come along.
- Even then people would need to switch, it would need to overcome the network effect advantage of Bitcoin, and the infrastructure would need to be built. 
- As that new innovation would need to be open source to be a contender, we would have to assume that Bitcoin wouldn't be able to update itself for whatever reason during the amount of time it would take for everyone to switch, infrastructure to be built, etc...
I feel that would be like "switching from the internet to something better". Why would anyone do it? We can just change the infrastructure behind it and it would still be the internet.

Sure, stock/flow is not a law or miracle revelation that will unfold and expectations have a big impact on price of everything, no doubt about it.
I just wouldn't make the "halving is priced in" assumption so easily although I certainly see how that assumption might look very reasonable.
In fact that's probably one of the most interesting things about Bitcoin:
1. Its supply reduces over time in a completely predictable fashion.
2. Its supply reduces **abruptly** by half every 4 years.
3. These two rules are impossible to change.
(I know that number 3 is a big assumption, but for the sake of argument lets assume it anyway.)
I don't think we have ever seen anything like this in the history of humanity.
As you've said the price of gold factores in the expectations from the guys who **believe** gold supply will increase exponentially and the guys who **believe** gold supply will disappear. Furthermore, these supply shifts are quite slow and the market has time to readjust and form new expectations. 
Bitcoin is different in this regard. 
1. There's no beliefs involved regarding supply. Supply will just drop. It will drop a lot!
2. There's no time to adjust your expectations. We are currently creating 12.5 Bitcoin/block. There will be a time, next year when the first 6.25 Bitcoin block will be mined and never will a block create 12.5 Bitcoins again in the future...
It's very hard to predict how this thing will unfold because it's unprecedented. But I fail to see how markets, considering their just a bunch of individuals acting in their own interest, can predict such a supply shock. 
The more you try to predict that event the more you have the potential to amplify its effects, because supply will definitely go down a lot and abruptly no matter what those expectations are.
I could certainly pose the hypothesis that factoring the consequences of such a supply shock might be impossible especially when so much individual expectations are at play. I could certainly pose the hypothesis that an attempt to "price in" this event might just amplify the effects of the supply shock.
But we don't really know. Lets just watch and learn from it.
EDIT: There's also another interesting thing to think about when comparing Bitcoin to other "more finite" commodities. Bitcoin is digital and used only as money/store of value, also it's divisibility is unprecedented. There's really no cap on how much you can hold. That has implications on the supply shock scenario.
For instance, imagine that there's a supply shock in car fuel. Immediately a giant line forms on every gas station. But there's only so much fuel you can store. You are not only limited by your economical situation but also by physical constraints and possibly by limitations imposed by government/gas station on how much you can take home...  
Bitcoin is also different in this regard. There is no amount of Bitcoin (money) someone can "consume" and think "ok, that's enough"... Also there's no reason to create a cap or regulate the number of Bitcoins you can have.
Could that have an effect on the way we react to the lowering of supply? Why not?

I'm so glad to have met someone who really has the technical knowledge to know what's really going on. And right on Reddit, of all the places...
Thank you very much sir.
@_date: 2019-08-28 07:40:46
It’s not. If you can understand block sizes and all that stuff you can understand the difference between a company (Lightning Labs) and a network (Lightning Network).
You could subscribe to the lightning-dev mailing list and see for yourself the development being discussed. You would know that there are multiple people working on LN which are not from Lightning Labs.
This is just as ridiculous as saying that [this company that makes solutions to protect buiding from lightning strikes]( owns Lightning Network because it has lightning on its name.
By the way, it’s like saying that bitcoin.com owns Bitcoin. Which is obviously not true since they are just a bunch of BCH crazy conspiracy theorists.
Also CypherpunkLabs??? Do you own all the Cypherpunks? Who is Satoshi?

@_date: 2019-08-26 11:58:23
I'm no expert on this issue but I would like to better understand your question. Could you clarify.
Are you asking if it is economically good for a miner to keep blocks small so they can keep hashing time down?
I guess the transaction fees for each transaction would largely compensate for the extra hashing time needed. 
So keeping blocks small just because it takes more time to calculate a couple of hashes would not be an economically good decision...
@_date: 2019-10-28 08:18:18
Blocks need to propagate in the network.
Every node needs to validate all the transactions and only then propagates the block. This takes time. 
I think you are correct regarding security. It will be the same **as long as you wait for more blocks to be mined**. But there would be a higher chance to create orphan blocks (or even multiple valid chains/forks) so your idea that you would only need to wait for 1 confirmation is incorrect. 1 confirmation would give you 1/10 of the security and you might end up in a orphaned block/chain.
This would probably also affect decentralization and node count since nodes with less processing power and poor internet connections would be in disadvantage as they would have a higher chance of getting their blocks orphaned.

Entirely new cryptocurrencies have been created. Still they find it very very hard to compete with Bitcoin.

I think you might be falling into the [nirvana fallacy]( as you seem to have unrealistic expectations on what it is to be “trustless”. 
Can you conceive of any complex system that you really understand to its core, to its atomic level even?
Can you conceive of anyone that really understand Bitcoin to the point that he/she could write:
- all the hash functions involved
- all the cryptographic libraries
- the p2p protocol
- the scripting language
- the compiler
- handcraft a cpu from raw silicon
- build the operating system on which to run the code
- build the satellite, the routers, etc...
.... so he/she can make a wallet and truly be trustless.
This is the bar you are setting. Not only for yourself but for anyone. With a bar that high Bitcoin can’t be trust. But so can’t any present or future creation.

I really don't get what you're saying here. But no matter how I look at it it seems that you don't understand what Bitcoin or blockchain is...


Stocks, real estate or anything else has flutuation...Here is a chart for Amazon:


What do you mean by China controlling the hashrate? I really don't get it...
But lets consider that it does control it...
Control of the hashrate doesn't mean centralization or control of the cryptocurrency. 
I have a node running, it follows some rules that are programmed in my own software, running in my own hardware. What can China do about it? Can it change the consensus rules? No. My node doesn't care for what China does or not. 
A 51% attack can be a problem, yes, it can block transactions from processing or reorg the network to make some double spends. But these would be easily detected and could be fixed. The hash function would change and the "big China advantage" would be lost forever. They would have to reinvest...All for some miserable double spends... Contrast that with just mining honestly and producing Bitcoins. There's a clear incentive for acting honestly.

You might want to work on that...
Just kidding! ��
You can trust that it is open source, and that may be key!
As Richard Stallman would put it, you have:
0. Freedom to execute.
1. Freedom to study and change it.
2. Freedom to distribute it.
3. Freedom to distribute your modified versions.
And just think of the number of eyes that look at that single code base. It takes just one good actor to detect a programmer who’s trying to insert some malicious lines of code.
And as per freedom 1 you can study the code and see for yourself. As per freedom 3 you can convince everyone else to run your better version.
Will everyone do this? No! But that’s ok. We need to accept that different people require different levels of trustlessness. Some people will use custodial wallets, for instance.
But having the option to go as deep as you want in the codebase makes all the difference.
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:41:24
The propagation time is not the major concern about block size. At least at this size. I don’t know where you got that idea.
The problem is that you have to validate all the txs since 2009 and the blockchain is increasing at a higher pace than tech is evolving, meaning that the time it takes to sync a node is increasing and it will keep increasing.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:04:37
I like the Bitcoin/gold comparison, but I believe that the existence of halvings every 4 years and the difficulty readjustment makes Bitcoin harder to stabilize. When gold is in high demand more can be mined. That’s not the case for Bitcoin.

Well, I compare everything to Euros because that's the currency I use everyday. 
The Euro was introduced around 1999 so before that I was using other currency and thought that I would never get used to the new one...
I was wrong.
Don't know if we will ever get to a situation where everything is priced in Bitcoin, but if your question is. Is it possible?  Yes it is.

Really? Were you there? 
Yes, people had very big expectations back then. 
- The fork wars drama had been solved. 
- Blockchain was the enterprise buzzword. 
- Segwit soft-fork happened. (people shouting "where is my 5.000$ Bitcoin." which actually happened...)
- There was a big expectation for Lightning Network.
- Shitcoins were pumping everywhere.
- Bitcoin ATMs popping everywhere.
Before the halving there were halving parties and stuff like that...
- 
People making unthinkable price predictions before the halving ($900 - $3.000!!!! 6x the price... Woooww).
- 
- 
Hindsight makes all these predictions and expectations look like nothing. We've seen it go to $20.000. But they were incredible back then. The expectation was real.

I see this repeated a lot of times but can’t see any reasonable explanation to justify this belief.
As an example: If BTC were to have a similar market cap to gold one single BTC would be around 400.000$.
And that is the case of gold. You also have silver, diamonds, and all other commodities...
None of them replaced USD.
That belief seems to be completely unjustified. A 1.000.000$ BTC can certainly coexist with a “reasonably” valued USD.

You are totally right. But then the merchant would be trusting Bitpay and whatever rules they follow (and throwing the Bitcoin advantage away).
If everyone did that Bitpay and the 5 or 6 mining companies could just meet in a small room and decide whatever rules they want for Bitcoin. They could easily cheat. There would be no community to *keep them honest*.

This is incredible and unexpected. This type of integration between corporations using LN might really start to create trust and positive pressure for people to use LN.
Big names adopting LN also provide more liquidity, making the payment experience better and more reliable.

Ok. Let me first state something that might be obvious but that I’m not sure you know about. It’s another property of Bitcoin that can be added to the previous list. A property that didn’t exist in any other *commodity* prior to Bitcoin.


So Bitcoin doesn’t stretch in terms of supply but stretches in terms of divisibility. That ensures that there will always be enough of this *commodity*. 
With that out of the way let me try to tackle your main argument:


Ok. Bitcoin is different than fiat. It doesn’t work like fiat money. That’s fine, I can agree with that. Some would argue that the divisibility property somewhat weakens this argument of yours. In fact Bitcoin’s supply is as endless as fiat supply. You might want to give some thought about that.


In general I feel like your overall argument can be summarized by this:


Would you agree with that?
I’m not in a position to argue with that for lack of economic knowledge. I’m totally fine with conceding this. Lets take it as a valid claim. 


Now, back to our original question: **What is the value of Bitcoin?**
Surely something can be valuable without being a standard of value. Commodities are valuable, for instance.
Lets look at a usecase and try to see if we can derive value from it.
Imagine you are one of the 5.000+ people trying to get to USA on that caravan that has been on the news.
Or one of the 2.000.000 non-EU member that gets into European Union every year and that can’t get a bank account.
Wouldn’t properties like the following give it some value?
- being weightless
- able to store it in your mind
- no need for any id or information to open an account
- impossible to confiscate
What I’m really asking is: Can we value Bitcoin as it is and not according to preconceived ideas like: “Bitcoin needs to replace fiat”? 
And given that we can value it: How should we proceed to do it?

Bitcoin as a store of value is a perfectly acceptable use case and probably its most important use case. Scarcity and incentives were cleverly built into it because of that.
Gold, as mentioned in other comments is the perfect example of that. 
We don’t pay stuff in gold and it is of great value. 
Yes, gold has other uses, it’s a good conductor and it’s shiny and all but that does not by any means reflect the valuation given to gold. Most of its valuation is given by its scarcity and its efficacy as a medium-of-exchange, just like Bitcoin! In fact, worse than Bitcoin.
Just by searching gold intrinsic value on google you will find countless articles about it. 
Some examples:
[This one](




Or [this one](




It feels like your opinion is unpopular because it doesn’t look like it’s based on facts.
I concede that it would be good that we all could one day use Bitcoin to buy everything.
I also concede that more adoption would increase Bitcoin value! That’s why LN is great!
But hodling is perfectly fine, it makes Bitcoin even more rare and it solidifies its use as a store of value.

In practice you connect to other people by committing funds that can only be moved if both of you agree.
Then you exchange bitcoin transactions spending those funds. These txs never touch the blockchain, you both keep them private and update them as needed.
Extrapolate that to a network of interconnected users doing the same thing and they can route payments between them.
Of course everything is made in a way that no one can game the system, block funds, steal funds, etc...

@_date: 2019-01-08 19:48:46
No. In a network that needs to be completely in sin having just one reference implementation with many eyes on the code is better than having fewer eyes on multiple implementations.
I was just reading that the last update of ethereum on testnet created a 3-way fork because of multiple implementations. Also look no further than the BCH, BAB,BSV drama.
Or imagine having to review complex changes like SegWit in multiple implementations.
A bug like the one discovered would create a double spend which is very bad. With multiple implementations you would get that coupled with a hard fork. 
The idea of running full nodes has nothing to do with bug prevention.

The basic thing to understand about that particular question is that we’re not there yet.
This is new technology, it has 10 years, almost nobody accept it yet, almost nobody owns it yet.
The market cap is too small. Around 1% of the gold market cap. Bitcoin inflation is still greater than 3% if I recall correctly, it will go down in 2020, and then keep going down every 4 years.
And “worst of all” it works! It works very well! This is the paradise for speculation because the potential is there but it’s just  in the beginning.
Now keep reading, keep researching and keep asking questions.

@_date: 2019-01-08 21:02:33
I know it was an inflation bug, just a mistake.
There’s no reason to believe that multiple implementations would be more resilient to this kind of bugs and no reason to believe that multiple implementations wouldn’t lead to more bugs.
Also no reason to believe that egos wouldn’t get in the way as it already happened in BCH.
The model as it is might not be perfect but trying to make multiple teams understand the subtleties of very hard to change and maintain code, where small, small mistakes can lead to catastrophic results is just chaos.
And there’s more than the consensus layer in bitcoin core. Things are optimized for speed, low bandwidth, fast synchronization and a lot of other things. Most of the complexity comes not from the consensus layer but in the way that consensus layer interacts with all the others in order to make the network run smoothly.
With multiple implementations you can even have multiple completely valid and bug free codebases that lead to multiple hard forks. 
Lets keep it simple and make more tests and better code review.
@_date: 2019-01-25 13:53:51

There are already multiple implementations. 
Multiple reference implementations is not a good idea. We wouldn’t achieve anything, just a guaranteed hard-fork even for minor bugs. With the added disadvantage that we could end up BCH/BSV kind of hard-forks where egos get in the way.

You can spend it, you can store it, you can do whatever you want with it!
We value freedom, and freedom is not "spend and replace" just because it gives you a nice warm feeling. Why would I care about what outsiders think?
This is not like all the other projects with:
- Fake transactions
- Fake nodes
- Fake blockchain size
- Fake decentralization
HODL is just a personal decision.

Ok, not a currency. 
Some kind of asset with a fixed limit supply that can be transacted quickly to the other side of the world with low cost, accepted internationally, permissionless, without any third party and without anyone (company/government) able to limit your freedom to make or receive a transaction. Does it need to fit your expectations for an ideal currency?

There’s a way to replace the tx with someone with more appropriate fee. So miners will look at it and say “I like this one better”. It’s called replace-by-fee (RBF).  I have never used it, don’t know how it’s done.
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:56:35
There is no single mempool. Every node has its own mempool according to the node’s own settings.
So yeah, the transaction might be there for as long as each individual node who saw it decide to have it on memory. 
This might be dependent on the individual node memory availability. 
Most nodes will get rid of txs when their memory fills starting with the tx with lower fees.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:56:58
I agree. Can you point to a chart with number of outputs of confirmed transactions over time? Thanks.
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:20:00

My point is that we have only one internet, we still use http and even stuff completely broken like smtp.
This is due to strong network effect, know how, trust,... And Bitcoin might be one instance of this.
The idea that a technology would come and everybody would think “Well, this is obviously better than Bitcoin, lets all switch” is naive.
Money is something you don’t want to put in some new tech because it looks great. The new tech needs to build trust and it’s very difficult to compete against 10 years of Bitcoin. 
Also most of the new coins are still a long distance away from having scaling issues, centralization issues, social attacks, hostile takeovers, etc...Bitcoin was proven trustworthy.
The same applies to the internet...We can build better protocols than tcp/ip, smtp, http, ftp, etc...but we have been building around it. Trust is not something you can buy with marketing budget and a couple of whitepapers.
This might be a winner takes all market and bitcoin will keep evolving without compromising on its essential values.

In my opinion you're thinking clearly about the idea that Bitcoin doesn't derive most of its **current** value from its use as a medium-of-exchange.
Sure, if you want to send someone 500M USD (112.450 BTC), no questions asked, having Bitcoin at hand would be the best and cheaper way, no doubt about it, and that's a value proposition in itself.
But for mass adoption and "buying coffee" there are better and cheaper alternatives.
Don't get me wrong, that could certainly happen down the road if its price stabilises. And that's ok, that give us time to build the tools needed for mass adoption like the Lightning Network. We want to be ready when we get there.
So lets leave that proposition out of the way: Bitcoin does not derive its **current** value from use as a medium-of-exchange.
So why is it valuable? Have people gone mad? What's going on here.
In my opinion Bitcoin derives its value from the speculation that it could be the best form of [hard currency]( ever created. And I also believe it has a shot of getting there.
Just think about it:
- A type of money that can't be faked. 
- A type of money where the inflation has been set in its creation, reduces over time and can't be artificially inflated.
- Easy to store, with no cost of storage.
- Easy to transport. As people usually say, you can transport it in your mind by remembering 24 words. No one will even notice you carrying it.
- Can be accepted by anyone. 
- Can be spent by anyone.
- Can be used in smart contracts that get executed automatically.
- There's no need to trust no one to verify that inflation is not occurring abnormally, you don't need to trust a central bank.
- No need to trust no one to verify that transactions are valid and that money is not being double spent.
- You just need to trust the software and the math involved that you can study on your own and that is running on your own machine.
Just compare some of these propositions with other forms of hard money, like gold. It looks like it accomplishes most of the good stuff that gold has (scarcity, durability...) and adds to that a lot of good features (transportability, can be sent instantly across the globe, you can prove you have it, etc.).
It's not that hard to believe that it has a shot of eventually rivaling gold has a store-of-value. And just by becoming a better store-of-value it could eventually get 100x its market cap. That's speculation sure. But it looks like a good asymmetric bet.
Only then it might transition to a great medium-of-exchange. By technically scaling and making use of some of its great features like smart contracts and LN. And then I don't even know how to begin to value it. Maybe you can help me with that!

You can mine empty blocks. 
When you mine an empty block (a block with no transactions except for the coinbase transaction) you still get the block reward.
Here it is the first block. There were 0 bitcoins before this and 50 right after
 
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:14:17
I think that the worst case scenario would be to find some bug that somehow was already exploited on a distant past block impossible to reorg.

Sure! Gold is valuable because everybody spend it like crazy.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:05:12
Nobody really knows what would happen in an event like this. I think this post assumption is that there might be some pressure from people afraid of inflationary monetary policies that could lead to an increase in price of Bitcoin because of the 21.000.000 coin limit. A kind of “Gold effect”.
People like non-correlated or inversely correlated assets when there is a crisis.

May I ask you to define what you mean by “working” in that sentence? Are you referring to the possibility that it might replace or rival USD or other currencies? Could Bitcoin still be valuable even if it doesn't replace or rival USD?
I see that you have strong opinions based on a lot of study of economics, current and past. 
You and I have touched on a lot of issues and I am feeling this can easily get way off topic if we don't get to build some common ground.
I value your opinion and the time you're taking on this so I would propose a simple exercise that hopefully can be enjoyable and can stretch our views about this topic. I challenge you to question your beliefs about Bitcoin and I will question mine.
So the goal is to find the answer to this question and this question alone: **What is the value of Bitcoin?**
I ask this question regardless of political views or ideologies. Regardless of what were the intentions of its creators. I couldn't care less for that. 
Reality is that we've ended up with this kind of asset that didn't exists and that has some strange properties:
- It's digital.
- It's scarce.
- Can't be inflated.
- Can be quickly exchanged online.
- It has no cost of storage.
- It is weightless.
- It is impossible to fake.
- It can be transported "in your mind"
- It is programmable.
- Can't stop no one to transact.
- Your account can't be seized.
- ...
I ask us to value Bitcoin for its properties and for what it is and - to accommodate for some speculative value - for what it can become.
I feel that it is perfectly reasonable to compare it to other stuff: Fiat money, gold or other commodities, ponzi schemes, whatever. But also feel that it doesn't quite literally fit in nothing that existed before its creation. 
Do we agree on that? Can we agree that this is a new kind of asset that didn't exist before?

If you run a pre-segwit node you won't see all the block information. 
You also won't be able to correctly validate the blocks since Segwit transactions will look like anyone-can-spend transactions without signatures. That's what made it a soft-fork.
A new node will see a segwit transaction and understand that it needs to perform extra validation.

Blockchain will make a lot of money to consulting firms who sell it to their clueless clients who don’t understand it.

Eric, thank you for your answer.
A lot of people who contributed to Bitcoin Core is not against a blocksize increase. They even managed to do the blocksize increase with a soft fork avoiding a chain split.
Why not just wait and avoid the risk involved in this hard fork. 
Let me remind you that the risk for a chain split and user's losing their funds is independent of Core merging the 2MB blocksize increase. There's no time for the community to upgrade.

Try it in the testnet. It’s great. 
You will open a channel and that’s it, you can pay to anyone in the network. 
You don’t need to connect to the central authority. If I’m already connected to the LN you can open a channel with me and you are done. The nodes in the path won’t even be able to distinguish if a payment was made by you or by me. They will look the same.
There is a lot of technical issues (rebalancing channels, finding routes... ) but they are being solved.
Do not listen to the FUD. Try it for yourself, keep in mind that there are still bugs and stuff and use your own judgement.
EDIT: So if you would open a channel with me that would be one onchain transaction. You would then be able to make any number of transactions to ANYONE in the network. 
Channels are between 2 people. Just like there is only one cable connecting you to your internet provider but you access the entire internet through that channel.

Hi u/evoorhees, thank you for your input. I appreciate that you are taking the time to discuss this issue with concerned users.


Let me just clarify that I'm not a Bitcoin Core developer, just a regular developer and Bitcoin user. But I follow the Bitcoin protocol development to the best of my ability.
As far as I can see every developer can contribute to Bitcoin. It's an open source project. If you follow the Bitcoin Core mailing list you can see that. Every day there is new people raising issues, asking questions and contributing. They are not Bitcoin Core affiliates nor BlockStream employees, they are just random people and developers who are interested in Bitcoin.
I think that the same cannot be said of the btc1 team. There are less developers, there is no innovation being discussed. Less code being written, less revision.
Just compare the September thread from the bitcoin mailing list:
To the September thread of the BTC1 mailing list:
Look at this gif for contributions in Bitcoin Core and BTC1. Both projects have the same history, because btc1 is a fork of Bitcoin Core, but look at the drop in number of contributions in the BTC1 repository since the fork.
We can't afford to lose this level of interest just because of an agreement! There are companies who spend years and enormous quantities of money to try to get this level of community interest and fail. This level of interest cannot be bought. And we already have that.
If miners and companies are so concerned about the  blocksize they can push for that change by showing its merits and discussing it in the Bitcoin mailing list. Let the active Bitcoin community review these proposals and you may find that they are open to listen to everyone.
Destroying this community because of a technical setting like a 1MB increase is not worth it. 
If communication is getting aggressive and there are two polar sides lets invest our efforts to find better ways to find consensus and to communicate. 
This hard fork will not contribute one thing to make this community better. It is a dangerous show of power without anything to be gained in the short, medium or long term.

LN will fix that, but remove quickly if you would like. 10 minutes average is not that bad for non-reversible transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:08:08
Right now you can do it for 2sat/byte that would translate into cents of a dollar. But that will also be fixed by LN. You should read about that. 
The point is that even with all that the other properties already make it valuable. You can’t say that of most or all other currencies (crypto or not)...
You are right about some of the problems that don’t make it great for every day use. But they can — and are being — fixed.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:59:02
Nop. They are not looking only at blockchain.Have you heard the senate hearing yesterday? 
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:28:22
Well, imagine you just copied a USD dollar bill. The bill would be exactly like the USD, with just a small change: Instead of George Washington the new bill has  Mickey Mouse on it.
Would it still be USD? How much would it be worth?
Now imagine Disney Store started to accept the new bills because they love Mickey Mouse. That new bill would be somewhat valuable, but not as valuable as the ones accepted everywhere else.
I guess that users, decide how much a Bitcoin is worth, and how much Bitcoin Cash, Gold, Diamond or whatever is worth.
Currently in Bitcoin the idea is that there is a reference implementation called Bitcoin Core. The Bitcoin Core software defines the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Anyone can make proposals to change this implementation. But these changes are only accepted if the community agrees that the changes are of any value so much of the disagreement is done before the code gets to your machine.
Is this the best method? I don't know, but has been working quite well. It survived attacks and attempts to forcefully change the protocol like the one that happened last year (Segwit2x). Also it looks like it makes it harder for bugs in different implementations to cause unintended forks.
There are people who defend that there should be multiple implementations, but for now this is roughly how it works. [Here]( is a great post by Gregory Maxwell defending the idea that there should be just one implementation of the reference software.

You need to understand one thing. As long as you run your node you accept the rules you want. If 99% of the network is run by chinese miners and they decide to change the rules your own node won’t care. 
A 51% attack concerns mining, not nodes, and even then they can’t change any rules because you control those rules by running your own node.
Bitcoin decentralization is not a democracy.

Can you teleport your lighter to another country instantaneously? No. 
Would a lighter that had that property be more valuable than the $3 regular lighter? Yes
What if there were only 5 lighters like that in the world instead of 5000 would it be more valuable? Yes
Of course Bitcoin would never have value if only one person was using it. The same for the usd or any other currency. The fact that people accept it in exchange for products and services make it have value.

It's hard to go back and try to find what really clicked about Bitcoin. I had kind of a background on network security and cryptography (although not at the level to be a Bitcoin developer myself, unfortunately...).
I first heard about Bitcoin on the [Security Now]( podcast probably in 2013 and completely ignored it. I didn't know anything about investing, money or the economy so I just didn't care.
Later in 2015/2016 I started to hear about it again. I was starting to get interested in economy, finance, valuation and all that stuff. So I've tried to read the wikipedia article about Bitcoin and didn't understand any of it. Public ledger and all that stuff...
Then finally I've stumbled on the original [Bitcoin whitepaper]( Read it. Loved it. 
I was lucky enough to have just enough background in cryptography to understand it. It's very well written, very easy to read. You should read it if you haven't done it already. I believe you only need to have an idea of what a [hash function]( is and what [public key cryptography]( is to understand it pretty well.
Then I've started to dive into the question of "What is money?". Everyone will have a different opinion on it. In my opinion money is just a technology to help people make transactions and if possible to store some value that can be used in the future...
I've read [The Bitcoin Standard]( which is kind of interesting and the famous post [Shelling Out: The Origins of Money]( by Nick Szabo which some people believe might be the real Satoshi Nakamoto.
I really don't care if some economists believe that money needs "intrinsic value" or it needs to be "backed" by something. If you are trading it for goods and services and you can store it it is some sort of money. 
And then there are some properties that makes some money more desirable than another.
Some of the properties of Bitcoin are very similar to the properties that make gold a good store of value. It is kind of neutral, nobody controls it, there's a limit amount of it. But it adds a lot of stuff that can make it better than gold:
- It's digital.
- Easier to transact.
- Easier to transport.
- Easier to conceal.
- You can travel with millions in Bitcoin without being noticed, without putting yourself or your family at risk (just imagine if you're running from war in your country)
- Easier to prove you own it.
- Easier to prove it's real and not a counterfeit.
- When demand goes higher you can't create more supply of it. (You can produce more physical gold by using more miners and machines when demand goes higher. But you can't create more Bitcoins/time)
- You are not dependent on monetary policies that change over time and might be subject to political and social influence. The monetary policy was defined on its creation. No one can change it.
- Bitcoins stock-to-flow will be greater than gold on the next halving. And will keep doubling every 4 years.
I can certainly remember some more properties that make it more interesting than gold. But of course it doesn't have the track record. It just didn't exist 1000 year ago... It is not a good electrical conductor and it is not shinny and beautiful. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bitcoin might not work out but it looks like a good asymmetrical bet to take. Gold current market cap is around $7 Trillion. Bitcoin's market cap is around $150 Billion...

Innovation is not impossible and will get integrated into Bitcoin. Most "innovation" in shitcoins is just nothing.
But with or without innovation the network effect is a barrier very difficult to overcome. This is not like when a new car/phone/computer company comes along and takes the market from another company. 
I can switch car/phone/computer and use it immediately. I won't need to make every one else switch to use it.
This is not the case for Bitcoin or stuff that relies heavily on network effects. Replacing Bitcoin is more like replacing the Internet.
Don't you think that we have better technology now then when the internet started? Don't you think that if we had the opportunity to start from scratch we would make the internet much better? But somehow the internet doesn't get replaced. That's the same for Bitcoin.
Most Bitcoin developers would make Bitcoin different if they could start from scratch. But they know they can't do it. And they also know they can't replace it. So they keep improving it the best way they can. They build on top of it, try to make changes that don't require changes to the consensus rules. Just like the internet.
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:04:53


Oh, you totally right here. Bitcoin represents value, it’s not value. Just like money. Just like usd.
Bitcoin is hard to understand and explain because money is kind of hard to understand and explain.
In the beginning of the internet the internet was really hard to understand also. People were talking about IP/TCP/POP/SMTP/HTML... Just imagine someone trying to sell you an internet connection back then...”Information exchange? What? I read the newspaper and watch the news, thank you very much...”
Don’t let the complexity fool you. I can guarantee you it is there for a reason. 
Keep asking the questions! Don’t let anyone tell you that Bitcoin doesn’t have value or that it is a sure thing! The future is uncertain.
Check for yourself! And then, if you’re interested, learn to explain it the best you can!
@_date: 2019-09-28 07:00:12
The value comes from its properties which are unique compared to anything else:
- Limited supply
- Easy to carry
- Easy to store (you can store millions “in your mind”)
- Easy to prove you have it
- Impossible to counterfeit
- Can be exchanged in seconds
- Irreversibility 
- Difficult to stop you from transacting
- Difficult to make more of it
- Difficult to seize
As someone who is not American and don’t hold any usd I also fail to see your point about the value being linked to another currency which I don’t hold and don’t particularly care about...
We might be used to value everything in some sort of currency. But currency (or any particular currency) is not the value itself.

Segwit2x agreement happened after the UASF initiative.
And Segwit2x was cancelled because the community didn’t want it,not because of any bug.
“Continuing on the current path
could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was
never the goal of Segwit2x.
As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become
obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens,
we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with
a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the
upcoming 2MB upgrade.”

Two interesting points you’ve made:


That’s one of the big differences between digital fiat currency and Bitcoin. You can’t just make it up. You can’t have the FED print it, or have a bank create more of it. It’s scarce. You might like or not like that property. But it is a definite difference!


Also very interesting. That’s not the case for Bitcoin. You transact it without any third party. Without oversight. Everyday there are transactions that are denied because they are too big or too small or were in another country or were suspicious. You can have your account blocked by your bank or government.
This might not worry you, but it worries a lot of people who are honest but not so fortunate as you and me.
Once again you might not like that property, but it’s there. It exists now, it didn’t exist in the past.

The “miners define rules” was indeed the theory at the split.

But with the ABC/BSV drama it kind of morphed to “honest miners define rules”. Kind of subjective, but when you are pot commited anything goes...
I believe the most recent theory is “Roger defines rules”. I’m sure there’s some anagram on a Satoshi email that proves it.

Yes, some people believe that Bitcoin will take over the world. That doesn’t look realistic if you’d ask me.
But the thing is: You don’t need world domination to get to some crazy valuations...A lot of people see it as a replacement for gold with a lot of better properties than gold like:
- Easy to verify that you own it
- Easy to prove to someone else that you own it
- Impossible to fake
- Easier to transact
- Easier to carry with you (you can literally carry it in your brain)
- Way more scarce 
- Scarcity is independent of demand (you can’t produce more bitcoins when everyone wants more)
- The costs of storing it are really small
- Easier to hide (just imagine trying to run from war, on foot with gold bars or money which will probably get stolen or be useless elsewhere vs going with bitcoin stored in your own brain and nobody even noticing that you might be carrying millions....)
There are a lot more than this, but many people feel this is enough to be better than gold...
Now, to be as valuable as gold (with a market cap of around 8 trillion) you’d need to have Bitcoin at around 400.000$ by now. So world domination might not be needed at all.

Not at all! Changing all the nodes, avoiding an hard-fork that would create confusion and corrode trust is what makes it difficult to change or update. And by the way, that’s by design! 
Miners have no opinion. If we decide to change POW to someone picking balls from a box and everyone agrees miners will just disappear. They have no opinion on the rules. There will be no amount of energy they can spend mining that will replace the man picking balls from a box. They are followers. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:41:56
[Have you seen the FED gold bars]( (at around 6 min)?
Are you telling me that all this Gold is there, guarded inside a giant vault with armed guys on the doors, because people realize that one day it can be turned into fancy jewelry and electronics? All the money being spent on transportation of gold in armored cars for some jewelry?
No! Gold has historically been a metal that is rare, difficult to mine more of it, easily recognizable (by its color), won’t be destroyed by water, air or fire, doesn’t need any special maintenance, easy to melt and create bars or coins, easy to store.
These properties make it a good form of money because they align with the essencial properties of money:
- Durability
- Portability
- Divisibility
- Uniformity
- Limited Supply
- Malleable (can be turned into coins)
Can you give me any other example of physical stuff that has these properties?
Of course today we know how to create forms of money that are for instance more divisible or portable...But scarcity has been a problem in digital assets until Bitcoin solved that.
Bitcoin in general has better properties. And even with high fees it is far cheaper to transport than gold.
Don’t get me wrong, once again, everybody would love lower fees. LN is trying to solve this very difficult problem. It needs time. 
Bitcoin is not ready to be a payment system. And that’s fine, we have great payment systems now. I’m in Europe and can instantly buy goods in the US paying with EUR for something listed in USD. Cool.
Yes, I would much prefer to do it in Bitcoin without third-parties, with low fees.
But I would never sacrifice security, independence from institutions, irreversibility and scarcity for low fees.
Also we should always remember ourselves that these high-fees are a sign of Bitcoin success, not of its failure. It’s always easy for the other coins that nobody use to scream that they have low fees. Well, Bitcoin would have low fees if nobody was using it too.
I respect and love Satoshi has much has everybody else, but that is kind of irrelevant for this discussion.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:08:55
Can you elaborate on the problems of this type of centralization?

- Is open source and independent from any company.
- Better protection against corporation takeover. Don’t forget to provide examples of attacks that failed.
- Has more market value than Bitcoin.
- Has more use than Bitcoin.
- More users than Bitcoin.
- Better decentralization.
- Has a better team of cryptographers working on it. Tell us the names, please!

Not liking LN is not a valid excuse to prevent everyone from using it. You are still able to do everything onchain.  
Also bugs can always exist, that’s also not a valid excuse unless you’re advocating for total freeze of the protocol as is.
There is nothing special about segwit that might introduce a special bug. It’s just a change. The most important thing is the process and the number of eyes reading the code. That makes Bitcoin core safer than most alternatives. You can’t even compare it to BCash or BSV or whatever.
There are people who’ve tried to make much smaller changes than Segwit and fucked up really hard. Segwit2x for instance. 
That’s what happens when a ‘genius’ tries to do all this stuff alone not measuring consequences. 
Segwit was checked and rechecked. It’s a change like many others that happened before and that will happen after it.
EDIT: I’m also particularly interested in knowing what you don’t like about LN. Change my mind about it!
@_date: 2018-12-24 11:41:42
Thanks! 
I take these topics as an opportunity to learn more and challenge my views. I now see that you’re doing the same.
This stuff is hard enough technically to understand but the psychological aspects of it are even harder. The simple but profound impact of the incentives involved make critical thinking our most valuable asset.
Just think about all the people running Bitcoin full nodes and LN nodes, add the developers who build this stuff, all the people who are not developing but are learning, add all the companies, the traders, the lambo astronauts...
These people are all different. Different countries, different languages, different religions... Some are libertarians, some are republican, some are democrats... Some want total freedom from state, some see benefits in having a state. Some like regulation, some don’t. Some want ETFs, some don’t. Some just care about small fees, others value the permissionless nature. Some like lambos and some don’t like material possessions at all.
And in the middle of the engineering trade-offs we must also balance the incentives of them all.
Critical thinking is the best tool we have to evaluate these decisions. Else we might end up being manipulated by people who want to profit from us.
I know how hard it is for someone to change their mind about something. 
Keep changing your mind. I’ll do the same!

What’s a good reason for having different IDs for transactions that are spending the same inputs and creating the same outputs? What’s the use case?
So why not just change that and be able to accomplish other use cases that are impossible with transaction malleability?
Why should have we waited for some scaling solution to fall from the sky when there are current solutions that could be tested by fixing such a small issue?
The other question is: why do you care now after the fact? Once again does something bad come from it?

The idea that Bitcoin is inflated because everyone is using USDT seems largely exaggerated.
Never touched USDT. Wouldn’t even know what it is if it weren’t for all the speculation around it.
A lot of people buy Bitcoin in USD, EUR or whatever and store it off exchanges to keep them for years...It’s being perceived as a store-of-value or a 5+ year highly asymmetrical bet.
For most of these people USDT and day traders are irrelevant. Digital scarcity and security is what matters. 
These people watched it go from low hundreds to 20.000$ to 3000$ and never for a minute thought about moving or selling Bitcoin. They are kept safely stored in offline hardware wallets. They don’t care about any USDT news or any other shitcoin.

As far as I understand currently multisig is done with a Bitcoin script. Something like this:
M &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; … &lt;Public Key N&gt; N CHECKMULTISIG
- N is the total number of keys present 
- M is the number of valid keys necessary to unlock the funds.
Validation of the keys are performed by running the same operations as the single key, just multiple times.
As you can see this looks like a very simple construct. I highly doubt that someone will find a security bug specific to this multisig functionality.

People who have bad content and money will still be able to communicate regardless of the barriers to entry.

@_date: 2018-12-15 09:17:01
I understand your concern about paper money.   
If people really want to hold the paper version instead of handling the keys themselves there should be some audit process in place to confirm that these institutions really hold the underlying asset. And that shouldn't be difficult to do. Just some digital signatures and you're done.

@_date: 2018-12-22 22:16:07
Nop. That’s exactly why you think bitcoin doesn’t work and exactly why you are wrong.
I’m not saying this to be stubborn or something...But it looks like you are missing key points in your understanding of the Bitcoin network.
When I download the Bitcoin software and set it running as a node I’m defining the rules that I accept as valid for myself. All the other nodes do the same. Then blocks get mined. If miners decide to mine different rules my node doesn’t give a fuck about them. If they decide to mine the double of Bitcoins of the current allowed reward my software will say: “Sorry, but that block is invalid. And by the way, I’m not talking to you anymore.”
How does that “sets the rules”? It doesn’t! They are paid to mine **valid** blocks (following the valid rules). They are free to mine whatever they like but it won’t be Bitcoin. There is no 51% attack that goes around that. There is no 51% attack that changes the rules that run on the software running on my computer. Same goes for the rest of the network.
An increase of the number of total Bitcoins is not allowed by the code currently running and it would lead to a hard-fork unless you convince every one to adopt that new rule.
Don’t take my word for it. In 2017 95% (!!) of the miners agreed that they would run software that would increase the current block size to 2MB. This initiative was called Segwit2x. Bitcoin Core were against it. 
Days before the update the miners backed down on the upgrade. They knew that they would be mining invalid blocks. They would be spending all that energy mining nothing. 
Miners serve the network and get paid for it. We are paying them for that service. They don’t define nothing.

This is backward compatible! What part of it is not backward compatible??
EDIT: The current rule says that coinbase reward should be equal or less than a certain value. As the new rule would set the coinbase reward to a lower value the change would be backward compatible, a further restriction to the current rules, meaning a soft-fork.
- Increasing coinbase reward is a backward incompatible change (Would lead to a hard-fork)
- Decreasing coinbase reward is a backward compatible change (Would lead to a soft-fork)

No. A 51% attack won’t allow you to change Bitcoin consensus rules.
They could revert some transactions by doing a reorg of the chain or block some transactions, that’s it.

It's now at 80$......
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:49:49
I can understand your reasoning. That question is very interesting. Thank you for that! 
Here's how I see it.
I think you correctly understand the concepts of soft-fork and hard-fork. They are different ways to update the network, that's it. Hard-forks lead to a network split unless 100% of the nodes get updated. Soft-forks won't lead to a network split given enough support.


I think that there is no such thing as a *valid* soft fork. There are soft-forks.
I also believe that you can't trace a line between soft-forks and 51% attacks. It's not a question of perspective. They are completely unrelated terms.
A 51% attack happens when some party (or a small number of colluding parties) has more than 51% of the hashrate. It will allow this party to:
- decide which transactions get in the following blocks
- rewrite some older blocks given enough time
Would they be able to apply soft-forks at will...Well, I guess so!
But does that mean that every soft-fork is equal to a 51% attack? Not at all! Because a soft-fork can be applied by multiple distinct parties that in total have 51%+ of the hashing power.
- soft-forks are ways to update the network that require large consensus in order to avoid chain splits. 
- 51% attacks happens when some party has too much power over the network.
At the end of the day this is a consensus network. People need to agree on the rules and decentralisation is key to keep the network fair to everybody.
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:11:22
Yeah, I concede that...
Please proceed with the conspiracy.
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:30:25
It would be cool if we could broadcast the transactions also without internet. 
Maybe blockstream can now focus on global ways for broadcasting. Radio, mesh networks, sms...
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:56:16


This change is completely backwards compatible!
This is exactly like Segwit. Exactly the same case.
I think I found what you're missing.
The current rules do not state that the miner reward should be **equal** to *some value*. They state that the miner reward should be **equal or less** than *some value*!
The change would be backward compatible because the new rule would state that the miner reward would be a value that is **lower** than the current mining reward. This is a case of further restricting the current rules.
If the bet was "It's  possible to make the miner reward equal to 50 BTC with a soft-fork" that would be false. 
- You need a hard-fork to increase the miner reward. (Because it is not backward-compatible)
- You need a soft-fork to decrease the miner reward. (Because it is backward-compatible. Old nodes would accept it)
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:41:08

There's never a 100% success rate soft-fork. It is a rule change after all...But the definition of soft-fork is that it is backward compatible. And this is a text-book backward compatible soft-fork.

No problem. Everyone makes mistakes. The most important part is that you understand why you were wrong. Take it has an opportunity to learn more about soft-forks and the current network rules.

The algorithm itself defines that blocks should be created at an average of 10 mins each. Of course this varies greatly since the process of finding is by random search.
The difficulty is readjusted every 2016 blocks. Since the creation of blocks is "tuned" to happen at around 1 block/10min it will take around 14 days between each difficulty adjustment.
If for instance all the 2016 blocks were found in 12 days the algorithm will adjust the difficulty up so the "cryptographic puzzles" get harder to solve. If it took 16 days the difficulty will be adjusted down so they get easier to solve. Always trying to keep the production of blocks at 1block/10min or stated in another form 2016 blocks/14 days.
Remember that the same algorithm is running on each machine and will calculate the same difficulty level given the same blocks. There is no central authority.
This way the number of blocks found is (almost) independent from the collective effort of all miners to find the cryptographic puzzle solutions.

LN does not reduce tx to zero. LN is a micro payment network. Do you only do micro payments?
If I want to pay 10.000$ I would never put them in a LN channel. Nor I’m guaranteed to get liquidity to make that transaction go through.
I would go on-chain. 
That’s why some people compare Bitcoin to a settlement network. 
Also there will always be tx opening and closing channels. 
It’s nevertheless interesting the scope of all the worries around LN. Some are worried that it would create congestion on-chain others worried that it would remove all tx on-chain.
Truth is somewhere there in the middle.

It's very important to never forget this: 
- **Every full node validates every transaction, every block and every transaction within the block regardless of doing mining or not.**
- **Miners do not decide any rule! Miners serve the network, they don't define it!**
There is also no one counting the number of nodes who follow this or that particular rule and deciding what is the "Bitcoin network".  The closest you can get to the official definition of the rules that govern the Bitcoin network is the open-source [reference implementation of the Bitcoin software](
People who want to contribute make suggestions to the [bitcoin-dev mailing list]( and decisions usually get turned into a [Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)]( and finally get implemented in software after some consensus has been reached.
So if you really want to be sure you are not being robbed you probably should run your own full node. If your full node is validating all transactions and blocks it will not accept any double spend!
There's no number of full-nodes or miners hashing power that will be able to trick the software running securely on your own machine to accept invalid transactions.
EDIT: 


You also seem to be confused about 51% attacks. There is no 51% attack that will change the rules of the Bitcoin network. 
If you have 51% of the hashing power you can eventually double spend by mining a valid block that contains a valid transaction spending some outputs and then making a reorg of the chain containing another valid transaction spending the same outputs that were spent before the reorg.
51% do not give you super powers of making invalid transactions valid.
As I've said before hashrate and mining don't define any rules.

This is not a guy with a node thing. 
The only way to change the consensus rules with such an selfdestructive change is for holders to want to do self harm. In that case well, they are all in agreement, there’s consensus, so it’s fair.
Anyway, if you’re scared of what the future might bring you really shouldn’t hold a large stake on Bitcoin. It’s true that a lot can happen in 10 years.

Hey! I've done a poor job of explaining myself in the other post because it seems that you've understood that I don't value decentralization.
I do! I am against BCash and was against Segwit2x, for instance. Decentralization matters. But there are various types of decentralization. 
For instance, on the Bitcoin network people raised concerns about these types of centralization:
- decentralization of Bitcoin nodes.
- decentralization of Bitcoin mining.
- decentralization of the infrastructure (aka what if ISPs decide to cut Bitcoin traffic.).
- decentralization of development (aka multiple implementations of the software.)
There are certainly more, these are the ones that I could quickly remember...
Some of these concerns for decentralization I find more important than others!
Taking for instance the first point. Decentralization of nodes. Clearly people value decentralization of the Bitcoin Network. These nodes run by people and institutions are what define the rules of the network. This for me is the highest level of concern. If people stop running their nodes and start blindingly accepting what blocks miners feed them then there is no security in the network. Essentially you get BCash. "Who cares about the nodes. Hash rate is what matters...Miners vote..." and all that bullshit.
Once again, that decentralization I wouldn't trade for anything!
Miner centralization is also a big concern. In my opinion it ranks a little bit lower than node decentralization. Why? Because nodes are there to validate the blocks miners give them. They won't just accept any garbage. If miners want to mine 300 Bitcoins as mining reward the network will be there to tell them "not on my watch! Sorry! I recognise that you just lost a lot of energy and money but I won't accept that. Please go away, I'm not talking to you anymore..."
So why is mining decentralization important if it can't change the rules? 
Because it can:
- remove the permissionless nature of Bitcoin. They can exclude people from the network.
- reorg the chain eventually creating double spends.
- Cause disruption. Mine empty blocks.
This is a cause of concern. Just not as much as keeping the network decentralized. We could eventually change the mining algorithm, move for another method like POS, a guy picking numbers from a box or whatever...It would cost us reputation and cause some disruption, but we could eventually deal with it.
We could do the same exercise for the infrastructure and for the implementation or for other levels of decentralization but I think you get the picture...
So my point is: Centralization/Decentralization should be analysed in context. We should ask ourselves "what are the adverse effects?" instead of going the quick route of "It's centralized. It's bad!".
Looking to a graph and asking if it looks like [this]( or if it look like [that]( sounds to me like someone who is just using a buzz word and doesn't understand why we need decentralization in the first place.
In my opinion you might have fallen for that when you said the following:


You're confusing Bitcoin centralization (mining, nodes??) with LN centralization without analysing them in contest.
So finally, regarding the LN my two main points are:
1. The LN is not that centralized and the fact that there are some highly connected nodes doesn't make it centralized.
2. Even if it were the adverse effects of centralization on the LN are not so bad as in the underlying layer.
To defend point 1).
We certainly can look at some nodes and see that they are highly connected. But how many payments would stop working if one of those was taken down. And how much time would the network take to adapt? That's hard to see from a graph like that, but anyone who've used the LN in the early days know that the situation is improving, not the other way around.
To defend point 2). 
Now if a highly connected node starts to misbehave and tries to censor some transaction or take high fees. 
- What is the cost of just routing around censorship? 
- What is the cost of routing around high fees?
The cost is negligible. I can run a LN node in a raspberry pi. If someone misbehaves the network will adapt and route around it easily. The barriers for entry are so small that competition will be high. The super-node of today will quickly become insignificant if he tries to disrupt the network.
So what if he doesn't disrupt and just keeps collecting fees. Is that bad? Why? What are the other bad consequences of having a super-node?
I don't think the LN is taking anything from the permissionless nature of the bitcoin network. And I think that the importance of decentralization in the context of LN is nowhere near the importance of decentralization in the Bitcoin network.
PS: I'm still not getting the comment 


but it might be just my incompetence.

Right nowI don't have the time to go through it all but just quickly:


You don't need the internet to make Bitcoin work. It's just convenient but you don't need it at all.


It's your responsibility to know what code you're running on your own machine. If you know what code you're running, if your computer/wallet or whatever is not connected to the internet you have nothing to fear.


This is just conspiracy thinking. You should probably read [this](
EDIT: Just think about it. How could the government allow such dangerous technology like the internet and encryption to exist and be used by all of us and criminals and terrorists. It's far more destructive than Bitcoin. Yet here we are.

Sure! That’s a good reason!
So we care about malleability because it enables new use cases that are impossible with it.
It’s very convenient to think that transactions spending the same inputs to the same outputs with the same values are for all measures the same and so they should have the same IDs.

Lets assume that the current difficulty is "Hash starting with three 0s".
1. Pickup a bunch of transactions, the hash of the previous block and a nonce. 
2. Hash that.
3. Check if the hash starts with 3 zeros.
4. **If it starts with 3 zeros** you just solved the puzzle. Broadcast all the information you've hashed to the network so they can verify that the block you've hashed is valid. **If not** go to step 1) and try with another nonce. 
5. Go to step 1) and try to find the following block.
After a certain number of blocks the algorithm will check if the blocks are being created too fast or too slow and adjust the difficulty accordingly. For instance if blocks are coming too fast the new difficulty could be "Hash starting with five 0s" or whatever...

There is also some second layer of protection for currently unknown vulnerabilities in ecdsa. 
If you only use addresses once you won’t share your public key until the time you spend that output and by that time you are already making that public key useless (given that you are not repeating addresses). So if there is some vulnerability in ecdsa, although we might be fucked we are a little bit less so.

No, gold being a store of value has nothing to do with those use cases.
Gold has been a store of value way before electronics. You might want to read Nick Szabo’s [shelling out]( 
The use case of Bitcoin is not payments and low fees. That’s a nice-to-have feature, but it’s not the use case of Bitcoin and shouldn’t be the use case for any blockchain. For that there are already better solutions like VISA.
The value of Bitcoin comes from being a scarce digital asset that can be irreversibly transacted without any third-party and impossible to inflate.
Nobody likes high fees, sure, but people won’t compromise on scarcity, irreversibility or security for low fees.

I don’t feel that it‘s technically any safer. It depends on who/how you store the keys. 
If you’re worried about this stuff there are probably better questions you should ask: 
- how to store my keys
- should I use a hardware wallet?
- how/where should I store my seed?
- Should I use an air gapped computer to sign my transactions?
- what if something happens to me and I want my family to be able to access these funds
- if I’m using multisig how should the setup be? 
- what if something happen to the other parties involved in the multisig scheme?
I feel like these questions are more important (and way more difficult to answer). 
I don’t have that many answers for you, but I can point you to the [glacier protocol]( You might find it interesting.

No, nodes are not looking at miners and saying “Oh, these transactions are fast, lets all update our software to accept other rules made by developers we don’t trust and give power to the miners...”
Think about it, a Bitcoin was worth 20000$ don’t you think that if miners set the rules and given that mining is so centralized they would get a meeting with each other and just decide to mine some more? 
Not trying to beat a dead horse here but it’s really important that people understand that miners mine what has value. They follow the value. They don’t set rules. A lot of people make that mistake and that rightfully leads to the conclusion that Bitcoin doesn’t work which is incorrect. 
Also, don’t get me wrong, 51% is dangerous. I’m not an expert in this but here are some things they would be able to do with 51%:
- Keep some or all transactions from confirming (effectively making a permissioned blockchain)
- Reorg some blocks and make double spends.

Ok, I get your point. You’re talking about disruption if a node goes down.
Let me start by saying that LN is not a perfect solution. It’s an engineering trade-off like many others. If we had infinite storage and infinite bandwidth we would be doing on-chain transactions, no doubt about it.
Let me also tell you why I don’t feel like your concern about disruption is a big deal.
Feel free to prove me wrong. I’m open to opinions.
As an example. When was the last time you’ve tried to make a VISA/paypal/whatever payment and you couldn’t because the network was down? 
Right now the 23rd of December, we are probably at the peak of Christmas buying. People are making more than 10.000 transactions/sec through the VISA network. A centralized network! Oh my god, how is that even possible? Do you see anybody worried that it might fail? What about the internet?
We are kind of used to this type of centralization. I’ll tell you more: that type of centralization works.
Now LN is even better than that. It’s not VISA. Anyone can run a node cheaply. And people do run nodes. Look at the number of Bitcoin nodes. It is increasing over time, not decreasing. I believe the same will happen to the LN. 
We only need a valid path to make a transaction. One! That’s it. If it goes through a node that is very large and is providing liquidity and getting some fees what is really the problem?
I would be concerned if:
- they could completely block the network
- they could discriminate between payers
- they could have absurd fees
- they could remove privacy
If I understand correctly none of that seems viable or more probable than, lets say, an ISP fucking up some router and stopping you from transacting.
Maybe I’m missing something but it looks like you are using “it’s centralized” as if it is a bad word and even than, looking at the graph, the centralization claim seems highly exaggerated.
Also I don’t understand the part of the transactions needing to be refunded...Could you please elaborate on that?
