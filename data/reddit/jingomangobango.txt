gotcha -- yeah I don't have enough holdings to be too worried about that yet but really should be looking into it now. thanks for the answer.

You have the verify your identity by providing more documentation than the DMV requires... what is this...

I eventually did get over the initial reluctance to provide and establish your identity so explicitly (I mean -- in that it really is going against the whole notion of a pseudo-anon cryptocurrency). Just hoping that the next time around or in the future these other exchanges prove to be an ok way to go.
Others have mentioned p2p exchanges like localbitcoins [dot] [com] so I've also went ahead and made accounts there. Learning a lot -- I appreciate the community.

hey I appreciate the tip -- also lol redditor for only 2 days? ;p

yeah makes sense -- as long as the price isn't too wildly different. Even +/- 100 USD is still just a 5% flux in value (but yeah that 5% is still enough to seek the best bargain).
any suggestions on p2p exchanges? or I wonder if you can rig up a modest diy/homebrew Visa/paypal/bitcoin clearing software &amp; hardware setup.

What's Trezor? -- I'm really just a (not complete) n00b to all this. Also, yeah from what I've seen on this forum decided to go ahead and register with Gemini and Bitstamp.

holyshit -- how? with coinbase? No one is able to get on it seems.

Should start your own religion too -- &amp; peg a coin onto it.

yeah - things seem to have stabilized. Coinbase is up and running and I also decided to go ahead and make some purchases -- not at the extreme dip at around 2.55 K USD but eh I'll take it.
