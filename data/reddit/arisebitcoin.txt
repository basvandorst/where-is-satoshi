We will have an official update later this week but in the mean time we wanted to share to following about project 2
No QR code, user submitted image and logo, focus on the New York area, closing deals with large sponsors, all donations go towards project 2. 
Best of all the advertising company we will be using for project 2 is going to accept bitcoins! More details coming soon.

The image used in Project 2 will be submitted and voted on by the community and will not contain our QR code. More details coming soon. Thanks for the support!

Sounds like this is a great idea for Project 2 -the Arisebitcoin Team :)

We still indent to proceed with project 2 but given the events that have taken place in the Bitcoin community over the past couple of months we have decided to lay low and focus on the back end infrastructure work that needs to take place on our side. This includes a better and more informative site as well as moving our site to a different hosting provider. We do plan on releasing an official update over the next several weeks. As of 3/24/14 we raised around 1.5 BTC.

We tried, and it's amazing the power even analog advertising still has. We reached over 10k hits alone from the areas we placed our billboards. Unfortunately the donations we received was less than 2 BTC and we couldn't continue to project 2. While we probably could have done things better on our end, a lot of came down to  the fact everyone wants to do it but only a handful want to contribute. Good luck to anyone who can succeed where we failed. 
For those of you who don't know Arisebitcoin, we purchased 27 Billboards in the San Fran bay area  for around 10k in late 2014 but we couldn't get much traction with the community, maybe it was just bad timing with Mt Gox and the China yap. Project 2 was going to be a flyer drop from a helicopter in New York...

This was a fun project from around 2013....  We spent about $8k in btc at the time to place around 30 billboards around the San Francisco Bay area. Ultimately it was a bust and we could not continue as we only received around 1.5 bitcoin in donations to fund the second project, worth less than $1k at the time. It was a fun ride while it lasted though.
 Fun fact, several "legacy" bitcoin folks reached out to us were looking for ways to incorporate their business to make money, such as adds on our website, not get the word out or support to the project. Most of those guys support bcash now. Kinda obvious what their agenda really is. bcash is trash.

On dec 27th, look to the San Francisco area, an organization devoted to purely promoting awareness to the mass public. 
The sites rough and we still have a lot of work to complete in 7 days but our site, mission, and first project are still on track to meeting our deadline.
 
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:43:20
Take a look at our future projects, maybe your last statement isn't to far off.
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:17:49
That's exactly whats coming on Dec 27th. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:04:44
Great idea, we do have plans for the Seattle area, but at this time we will not be directing it at Amazon.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:59:54
Sorry for the delay. We were working to confirm what billboards were up and what weren't. We don't have any hi-res pics but out latest update on the site has an example pic. We'll be posting user submitted pics as they come in.
Thanks for your patience!

We worked on the design for our first project internally. We are hoping by project 3 that users will be able to submit and vote for the image that they want on the next billboard or used in a future project. Only a handful of our future projects entail using billboards/posters.
Checkout our site under Projects&gt;Project 1 for full details which has the locations of the billboards/posters and the image that was used.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:40:36
Definitely not, and we are hoping to earn the trust of the community with the success of project 1 and 2. Our main goal is to help promote bitcoin to the general public and point them in the right direction. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:38:13
We couldn't agree more. We are going to try and do our part as this is were we can add additional value.

On dec 27th, look to the San Francisco area for an organization devoted to purely promoting awareness to the mass public, not begging like this.

Excellent points and while we do agree with several of your comments, people fear the unknown, and when the day you speak of comes our goal is that people will relate the word bitcoin to digital currency, not something for the xbox.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:46:00
To clear any confusion, project 1 has been paid for and is going live tomorrow. We are already working on project 2. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:46:11
We have added this to our list and plan on posting it for review over the next couple of weeks. Great ideas!
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:43:22
We have updated the site to represent a number of the changes you and others have mentioned.
Space at the top has been corrected
The logo has been updated to take advantage of whitepace. We did keep "The revolution has started" tag as this is what we are using for the campaign in project 1. This is flexible and will probably change with each campaign. Since you took the time to create a very constructive break down of our site, we used a logo similar to the one you created as a thank you.
The image for "new to bitcoin" has been updated, but still has a ways to go but it is better than the one that was there prior... not by much.
We are taking a look at the menu bar, resolution and continuing to work on a number of suggestions mentioned.
Thanks everyone for your support!

Thanks for the input and the team really likes your ideas. You'll notice in the FQA we commented on the current status of the site and plan to improve it. Since we are community driven and we want to show that, the team is going to start working on a logo, similar to the one you submitted. Great ideas, please keep them coming!
