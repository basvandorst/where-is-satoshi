There is no reason for miners to fill blocks other than to keep good faith.  Seriously, until the blocks started filling up and it became an actual issue, they did this all the time, but now that we are at max capacity they can't do it without negative consequences.  This is just how it is.

No such thing as a purchase transaction on the blockchain, they are all just transactions and the only thing that sets them apart in any meaningful way is the fees.  Miners and mining pools have everything to do with transactions because transactions are included in new blocks by miners.  No new blocks, no new transactions.  Miners get the fees when they complete a block, but pools may or may not pay out the fees to its members.

He's right, the smarter the network the more tools people have to suppress the flow of information.  With dumb switching, they are limited.  Things like software defined networking that centralizes control allow a single authority to command exceptional control over the flow of information on a network and code can be added at any time to add more control.  This is the future and it is coming fast.

Confirmation bias, same reason I downvote Trump related submissions.

You can't plan that far ahead, we have no idea what technology will exist then and it is very reasonable to assume it will change dramatically before then.  Go ahead and start planning but no one will take it seriously until maybe a decade before we arrive.
  
Fees incentivize the current system, you can't really apply it to 100 years from now.  Powerful enough computers may become so powerful and so commonplace that everyone is able to participate and support the network with zero cost to themselves.

I used to buy a 1/10 american eagle with every paycheck and now I buy bitcoin.  Been that way since 2013.

Then people will lose faith in the network when they see miners working against the greater good.  So this will affect price and will in turn affect the miners profits.  So they won't do it on purpose too much because it will negatively affect them.

I signed up just to up-vote you because this has been my biggest take away from this whole thing, that bitcoin is resilient and it will take more than just full blocks to bring her down.

Depends on where you bought.  If you bought it from an exchange, the price is usually locked in when you buy it.  So if you use coinbase and you paid 530 for 1 bitcoin that's how much it cost even though you don't get it until the transaction clears.
