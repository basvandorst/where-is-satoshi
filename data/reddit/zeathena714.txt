Yeah I kinda fucked up my last sentence.
What I meant was that if I plan on buying btc every monday for example, but the price is dropping fast on a particular monday (like it did this week) I wouldn't buy while it's falling and wait until it stabilise or start coming back up.

Funny you should say that, because I've been staying further and further away from recently because of all the bitcoin cash drama that goes on in here. 
I really wish we could simply ban this kind of posts and memes because they bring absolutely nothing but drama to the community.

Is there any strategies that would have inherent value that I could read about?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:27:59
As someone who's looking to buy some crypto, could you tell me exactly what do you mean by "dollar cost average"? 
My intuition was to not buy everything at once, but put in the same amount every week (or two week or whatever), unless there's a particularly big dip in which case I would just wait until it goes back up. Is it a good idea?

I think the danger here lies in the fact that there were only 5 nexus 5 offered. And if say 10 people did it pretty much at the same time (it can take a while to upload a video to youtube to confirm that you did it), then 5 of them would have destroyed their iphone for nothing.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:19:56
True, but as far as I know, that tended to happen after a long battle and when no other solution was useful. Kind of a last resort, not a first reaction. That's what pissed me off with this matter. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 08:30:41
Maybe he just bought them when prices were low.

Sorry if I didn't phrase it correctly, I wasn't trying to generalize anything about what you did. After all, I'm not you, and I don't know what you thought when you did it. But I think some people might see it that way, and I don't think it's good publicity for this sub or for bitcoin in general. It's more the way it was upvoted that fast that made me write this, than people who smashed their phones. If you managed to get a better phone for it, then I'm glad for you, really. I just worry about how people outside this sub would have reacted by seeing this being the top post if it wasn't removed.

Sorry, not an english speaker here. I corrected this mistake.
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:37:27
That's exactly what I think. The public doesn't have a very good opinion of bitcoin, and this kind of thing doesn't help. But apparently a lot of people thinks differently here :/
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:32:11
I think there was very little chance it would change anything, but I also think there was a risk here. From what I saw, it was (very briefly) the most upvoted post today, and very close to being the top post for the week. I think it's not a very good publicity stunt, and I really don't see how we can expect to be taken seriously if we encourage this kind of behavior. 
My criticism was more on the thousands of people who upvoted it than on the OP or people who did it. As you said, it was just five guys, with five iphone, nobody cares. But having this the most upvoted post really makes me worry about how people see this sub.

My bad, I was thinking of debit card indeed. We don't have credit card where I live, only debit card, even though we call them credit card for some reason (well technically we do have credit card but they are really really rare).
So for a day-to-day use (i.e. using BTC as currency), debit card wins on all front. You can use it everywhere, it clears literally in seconds, and in most cases you have 0 transaction fees for the buyer.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:54:03
I know they charge the merchant. But the lack of fees for the buyer is a pretty important thing. People will be reluctant to use BTC if there will be more fees, even if they are small. 
And that's just one thing, you have to take into account the fact that currently it's harder to get BTC than to get a debit card, there are fees to convert USD to BTC, there's no guarantee on your money if you get hacked or lose your account, I don't think there's guarantee either for purchases (whereas you have fraud protection on a debit card purchase) and a bunch of other stuff.
At this moment BTC is definitely not a good option for day-to-day currency compared to debit card. The future will tell us if that's gonna change, but I don't see how some of those negative points are ever gonna change.

Email provided a better alternative to regular mail right off the bat. It was way cheaper (if not free) and near-instantaneous. Availability was the big problem at first because not everyone had an internet access, it only really disrupted the regular post office when internet became ubiquitous.
Right now BTC doesn't offer a better paiement method than regular ~~credit card~~debit card. It's slower, costs more and it's not easily available. If BTC wants to disrupt the banking world it needs to become cheaper, faster and more available than ~~credit card~~debit card. Maybe it will happen, but I'm not sure we're going in that direction right now.

That is a pretty bad example.
The reason we know there will be a sunrise tomorrow is because it's almost impossible to disturb the Earth-Sun relationship between now and tomorrow. One of the only thing that could happen to prevent sunrise tomorrow is if a giant rogue planet knocked us out of orbit without warning, and that's super mega far fetched. Essentially, the Earth-Sun system is a closed system with almost no variable that can change abruptly, so we have no reason to expect anything different than what has happened since forever. We also have literally millions of historical data point, not just 3 or 4.
But Bitcoin? Or any kind of human-controlled market? There are thousands of variables that can change from one day to the next, leading to huge price changes. It's still probable that we'll see the same thing that we've seen before, but it's nowhere near the degree of certainty that we'll see a sunrise tomorrow. It's orders of magnitudes away from that degree of certainty.

You know I was just poking fun at the fact that you used an awful example, borderline irrelevant, to prove your point. I don't know how that counts as "straw-maning" but whatever.
But please enlighten me, what was there to learn in your comment? That we can use past data to infer what could *probably* happen? That's it?

Forgot to mention it, I already tried it, but I have a huge problem with it due to my bank : if I want to make a SEPA transfert to a previously unknown bank account, I have to sent a letter to my bank with IBAN informations, and it takes 3-5 days to enable me to put the transfer. So unfortunately this website is really unusable for me :(

Thx, I'm awaiting verification on bitstamp.net, I'll check the others.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:16:10
Tell that to all the business accepting BTC. If they can't easily exchange their BTC with dollars, they won't accept BTC anymore. Most of them won't have the time/interest to exchange every thing with cash on localbitcoins. And business accepting BTC is a major reason for the success of BTC, that's why so many people on this subreddit want business accepting them, or cheer every time someone do it.

I'm betting you are 100% right. Trolling people is the oldest profession on the internet, and this sub won't be spared, especially with all the people in love with BTC. The more you love something, the more you'll get trolled. But calling trolls "shills" and thinking they are out here to destroy bitcoin (or even thinking they can make any sort of impact by downvoting posts) is really taking things a bit too seriously if you ask me. 
It's reddit, there will always be troll, there will always be people taking things too seriously, there will always be people taking literally the phrase "internet magic money", and sometimes the mix of all this is really ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:45:10
Some people on this sub can really become ridiculous sometimes. People who downvoted your post are automatically some shills ? Maybe they just think that your post is grossly disconnected from the reality and adds absolutely nothing to the conversation about bitcoin (if we can even call that a conversation). 
Seriously, I feel like I'm on 4chan or r/atheism reading this kind of stuff. And I feel like I'm an oldfag for thinking that this sub was bay better before a lot of kids came here spamming to the moon posts, putting bitcoin on a pedestal and mass-downvoting any criticism.
If reddit has the power to bring down bitcoin (which it doesn't, reddit has little to no effect on bitcoin prices), it's people who put too much faith in it that will be responsible.

You need to take it at a specific time, shortly before the fallout reach you. If you take it too late, the radiation fallout will already have saturated you thyroid and clean iodine won't do anything. But if you take it too soon, your clean iodine will saturate your thyroid and then slowly gets out of you system before the fallout reach you, leaving empty space for radiation to kill you.
TL;DR : Taking iodine before an incident will NOT help you, except if you take it right before the incident and you get expose to the fallout right away.

Thx for the information, I assumed there was some drawbacks, now I know.

Thanks for the name, don't plan on doing it anyway, I was just curious.

* Drones = world wide PR pn every site for something they have not intention of using
I keep seeing this everywhere, but what are the sources ? Sure the "unveiling" of the drones was a pure PR move, but that doesn't mean they won't use them in the future, unless I'm missing some information. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:40:51
France, but I think it's not this way in every bank. I *think* I can do an immediate transfer from my bank branch, not from my internet account, but I'm not even sure, and I don't want to drive 1 hour each time I want to purchase bitcoins (without even mentioning the fact that the trade might be cancelled by the time I get to my bank). Anyway it sucks.
