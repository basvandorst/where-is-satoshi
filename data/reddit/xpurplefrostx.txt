haha that's like saying that transactions aren't instant because it takes more than a second for them to go through and you to receive your product. you're splitting hairs and missing the point of my statement, but then again i'm not sure what I expected...

You really think the electricity cost from confirming 2 past transactions is comparable to even a single btc fee (&gt;30€). You must be delusional.

just any wallet that supports BTC (which is any of them), look through some of the older posts on this subreddit and you'll find some good suggestions. if you don't have a lot invested something like Jaxx is probably enough, just beware of phishing websites, assume everyone and everything is trying to steal your precious bitcoins and take every precaution to ensure they're not able to.

depending on what coinbase decides to support you'll most likely be able to control one of the funds but not the other. if you want to have full control then you have to be able to access your private keys, something that you can't do on coinbase. no you don't need to spend both your BTC and your B2X at the same time. the monetary value associated with BTC is almost certainly not going to be the same, if you own 1 BTC you will be "given" 1 B2X, which could be worth anything but is not going to be worth exactly the same as 1 BTC. look at when bitcoin forked with Bitcoin gold and get an idea with what happened there.

you would need to create a new offline wallet, using something like JAXX and then sending the BTC to the address of the new wallet. look for older posts on this subreddit with better instructions if you still find yourself unsure about how to procede, a lot of people have had the same questions

Update: Coinbase has sent out an email to all of it's users saying that it will allow you to trade BTC and B2X on it's site shortly after the fork, so there is no need to move your funds out from a logistical stand point. however, security wise i wouldn't keep funds on an exchange website.

They own about 120,000 BTC (give or take), at today's prices that's 723188400 Euro. Zuckerberg's net worth is estimated to be about 89 times this, so BTC should be somewhere around 536000 euro per BTC. all assuming his net worth doesn't keep increasing.

looks like it'll be a while before they surpass our reptilian overlord.
