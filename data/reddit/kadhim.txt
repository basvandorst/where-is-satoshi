Hello, I'm the author of the piece. I don't agree that I have missed the whole point of bitcoin. Part of the bitcoin project concerns its use by consumers. This article is specifically about that.
The very first sentence is "Bitcoin is revolutionary, both politically and technologically."
Later I write: "A currency that isn’t controlled by the state undermines government authority; a decentralized method of transferring ownership of digital assets is a great technological opportunity; but the more the banking sector does to make payments convenient for customers, the case for bitcoin as a rival weakens."
I am not saying that bitcoin is inconsequential at all. I am saying there's a challenge for bitcoin businesses to prove that there's an advantage to *consumers*

Ah yes, I saw! Thank you – you've done a great service in producing all these (high quality) videos.

Ah ok, I get you. Generally though, is there not an incentive for a company that relies on on-chain transactions to make an arrangement for those transactions to be prioritised?

Awesome, sorry for jumping the gun!

Can someone ELI5 why orphans + blocks in a row would raise red flags? ([Text below quoted from organofcorti](
*"So, how about those 19 GHash..O orphaned blocks in one week, huh More interesting though is the five orphans in a row that occurred toward the end of the week. Why so many orphans, and why so many in a row? It might be coincidence, but then they also managed one eight block-in-a-row run, a seven block-in-a-row run, a couple of five and six block-in-a-row runs and ten four block block-in-a-row runs. A run of orphans and lots of runs of solved blocks? That's starting to raise some red flags for me at least."*

Only if you assume that merchants will always use payment processors that convert bitcoin payments into fiat.

I missed your reply for some reason.
I agree Paym is a reactive measure, but I don't think a measure being reactive necessarily means that it should be dismissed.
With regards to why most bitcoin users *currently* choose bitcoin over fiat, I totally agree. At the moment you have to believe in bitcoin as an idea to make the decision to use it as a consumer; for a business to accept bitcoin I would somewhat cynically suggest that you have to either believe in bitcoin as an idea or alternatively as a marketing tool.
The chargebacks argument has always perplexed me. Consumers love chargebacks and in a free market, a service offering chargebacks (all other things remaining equal) will beat a service that doesn't offer chargebacks. Happy to be persuaded otherwise.
EDIT: a word

Have heard the same at Ernst &amp; Young – friend of friend was asked to write an essay on bitcoin as part of their training (or some kind of internal exam).

Hello, I'm the reporter at the FT Alphaville blog who has been writing about WB21 (verification:  I have not spoken to anyone called Christian K in relation to this story. Everything we have published has been researched thoroughly and Mr Gastauer has been given an opportunity to comment in advance of our stories being published. The account "Investigator_FT" appears to be someone impersonating a FT journalist in order to discredit my reporting.
