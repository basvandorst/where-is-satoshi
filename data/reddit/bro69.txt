I for one missed price memes and this sub has been lacking without them 
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:28:27
Very cool. I was looking for a real-time rep tracker to keep an eye on the market, thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:45:54
Yup, but when you look at the order history they’re not selling. Coordinated efforts to drive the price down and buy more probably. Read up on whale sells walls. If you have 10 btc you can control gdax for a bit. Buy walls come in around 14500 though.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:20:05
Whales taking easy money. Sell and buy walls forcing people to play their game.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:36:03
Need some positive news to offset the mainstream media’s negativity.

Just what I’ve noticed, do your own research and good luck!

CLIMB BABY CLIMB
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:43:35
It’s actually the opposite, what you’re witnessing is a sell wall with large orders that can only be bought whole. This drives the price down and allows big investors to buy bitcoin for cheaper. Think about it, if big whale John smith is asking 14500 for his, and you want to sell now, you have to sell for 14499.
It could be in anticipation of a move that would allow the price to climb organically At which point they can then sell for profit. They do this all day and just print money.

Please hodl me
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:48:41
Happens every 2 months, money flows from bitcoin to alts and then back. Weak hands lose theirs, rich get richer. Media hype adds to it all as hype = more new ppl come in.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:02:04
You’re buying it from a seller, not coinbase. In order to immediately fill your order, you pay a premium. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:48:16
Haven’t seen as much group power with the hodl memes lately. This is probably because it’s a healthy slow downward consolidation, which is likely necessary for the long term.

Thee Alfonso wheeler? How do you know THEE Alfonso wheeler 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:33:05
Use excel. Very simple and a good way to track your investment.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:44:39
It’s a market order. You pay more so it can be filled instantly.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:54:38
I would also love to know when they are coming :(
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:06:57
Can confirm, they look similar.

PNS UP = PSY DESTROYED
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:11:09
Your order is filled immediately via credit card. The hold up has to do with fiat transfer not with liquidity, Jesus dude use gdax and learn how to use it. Coinbase is excellent for one thing, transferring fiat into a market.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:57:33
Disagree, check sell walls vs history, these are sell walls driving price down. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:43:49
Can anyone link a reaction video? Has he put one out?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:24
Oh it’s so expensive!!! I wish i bought two weeks ago, if it goes down I’m going to buy!
*correction occurs*
Oh no the bubble popped!
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:06
This guy gets it
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:26:20
My exchange with my brother:
 “sell, it’s a joke.
Did you read the whitepaper?
So you really have no idea what you’re talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:29:28
Buy sell low high as they say.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:35:29
Jesus that website’s font’s kerning tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:37:47
The point is you control your money without a bank. No one forced anyone to sell today.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:47:18
Bitcoin gonna bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:45
Can confirm, i was the coffee 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:25:00
Mine went up with time and more max buys
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:18:39
More like fudstreet
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:09:05
Been there. Now i use averaging and buy 25% staggered.

Adoption comes in waves, even of pyramid schemes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:14:57
I’m just saying, some people lost money today, but some people made money today, depending on their reaction.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:53:05
After early adoption ends.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:53:22
Checks post history 
Ahh. Got it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:50:59
I’m not denying shit, nor did i sell. Guess what, my portfolio is almost back to where it was.
I’m also noticing a LOT less negative posts.
Curious how that happens.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:39:22
Didn’t you hear? The bubble has burst. Pack it up boys the game is over.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:25:25
Then being an early adopter probably isn’t for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:00:57
Morgan Stanley would also be worth 0 if it wasn’t for the print button printing 100 billion smackeroos
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:26:49
If anyone actually read the whitepaper then they should know attack’s are part of it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:36:03
Nothing at all and of course that’s happening?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:31:18
If you believe in the product then yes, “buy the dip.”
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:35:41
It sounds really tinfoil hat like, until you realize that it goes away and the dip suddenly does too. Also they never seem to speak English that great.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:51:33
I’ve only been hanging out since bitcoin was $2500. I felt just as nervous putting more money into it then as i do now. I knew back then it could 10x, maybe, hopefully... and at this point I’d be cool with 2x.
Hindsight is funny, a lot of people act as if they knew without a doubt something would happen. There’s still doubt but less risk now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:28:41
Sent 1000 for 14$ in 30 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:35:58
I thought 42 was high because it would dip back to 39... wish i bought. Oh well, i have made a killing on eth and btc
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:48:37
My only regret is running out of fiat to buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:09
Just means I’m disciplined.
Nothing personal mate, just noticing you’re from bch posting anti bitcoin posts in the bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:36
I believe it. I tried to buy bch during the massive shit storm so i could sell after a short gain. It ended up giving me more btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:23:58
The sentiment i hear the most right now is “oh it crashed? How do i buy right now?”
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:10:57
“I want to start a campaign to improve my online reputation.”
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:17:53
Mine wouldn’t verify. I was using the phone app and it’s not clear it’s asking for the transaction amount, but coinbase already provides a decimal. In other words i was entering “..01” and “..10” instead of “.01” and “.10”
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:34:13
You seem disturbed 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:09:58
If you check the comment history of a lot of the bitcoin cash posters, and a lot of people who are posting news articles about bit coin cash, you’ll see that their accounts are like a-year-old but have very minimal post history, I work in a field related to and involved with lobbying, and a lot of companies i serve hire PR firm‘s to bring an artificial presence on the Internet. This is exactly what’s happening right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:05:27
It’s also not using a linear progression
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:06:26
You ok bud?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:45:45
I️ bought at 3400 after it hit 3600, proceeded to feel pretty dumb til I️ felt smart. Bought more today. I️ feel medium.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:42:16
It’s fungible. The same way you keep breathing all of our used air. If I were you I would read the newcomer post that is pinned.

The particular client I worked in is a very well known company, and they used companies like “xyz media”, “xyz consulting” etc. it’s all public info, i think on guidestar iirc. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:22:48
You’re in a good field, there will be other opportunities. You could say the same about many stocks. Just be ready for the next thing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:42
Look at the bright side, we get to relive bitcoin breaking 10k over and over again!

Same problem here, never got any resolution. I️ tried to use the chat feature to no avail.
