Hi suclearnub
We are crypto only for now, no verification required! Only an email address is required to sign up and begin trading. 
We do plan on doing fiat in the near future and most likely, if you A) deposit fiat via a bank or B) withdraw fiat to bank account, you will need to be verified. But our users will still be free to be trade crypto only if they wish without the need for verification. 
We are always looking for new deposit/withdrawal methods for our customers and some of which do not require verification even for fiat. For example in Hong Kong bitcoin ATM's do not require any AML/KYC to purchase BTC (infact AML/KYC on an ATM might conflict with privacy laws here)- this is a funding method we are investigating.

An app that tracks prices, arbitrage tracker, automatic trading bot, a way to sell bitcoin locally without needing an ATM- there are many many possibilities! :)

Hi sebicas
Our code is based on the Peatio project you can view here [here!]( we continue to make contributions to the github and welcome everyone else to aswell :) Our mining pool Sparkpool is forked off the well known Nomp project too.

Hi KarmishMafia, thanks for the feedback, CEO of bitspark here- George Harrap. Yep trust is something we as the bitcoin community have needed a lot more of not just recently but for many years. 
Let me share a bit about my background- I have a background in electronics engineering and am a long time bitcoiner since early 2011/2012 I started as a miner and progressed to trading, lending and all manner of things- I've been on the receiving end of being screwed by mining companies not delivering and random bitcoin website/companies going bust overnight so I decided there must be a better way a started Bitspark to fix some of these problems. None of our team has a criminal record and we are all active in the HK startup and bitcoin scene, happy to meetup at an event sometime just ask the organisers they are sure to point me out. 
We are tech guys/gals at heart and love building great products. We use open source software (exchange is built on Peatio) and features like auditable reserves mean you don't need to take our word for it that the money is there, its independently verifiable. 
Our company and team has been vetted by Cyberport extensively in order to get into the incubation program and will continue to be. Hope this helps!

I'm George, CEO and founder of Bitspark and last year I went on an extensive tour of Iran (paid for in bitcoin of course) and It's something we've been eyeing for a while. I have been in contact with a number of the people I met and Bitcoin is at the top of the list of things that can improve the lives of Iranians. Are you aware of the Persian shoe vendor in Isfahan? As far as I'm aware they're the longest running bitcoin vendor. Send an email to us at  and we can discuss further. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 08:56:32
We are pursuing a few options :) most obvious for us is Indonesia given the large number of Indonesians sending money back home from from HK too.

On the launch of our Cash in Cash out Remittance service via bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-11-05 14:13:00
Our API is now Live!  unleash the trading bots!
@_date: 2014-11-26 13:17:29
Does WU realise we have a shop right down the corridor from a WU and we send money cash in cash out overseas for half the price WU does leveraging Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:36:00
Much like BTCchina's webapp  :)
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:06:51
Yep, our rate is approximately 1% (larger transactions have a reduced fee) which includes both our fee and our partners fee. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 13:32:19
Thanks dnivi3 will fix the spelling asap. On the remittances: as a Hong Kong based company our first target market for remittances is the large number of overseas workers sending money back to the Philippines and Indonesia. We don't want people to need to learn about bitcoin (although great if they do) in order to send money overseas so we have made our prototype web/app service that just uses bitcoin as the means of transmission. We are currently concluding our talks with payment providers now and will have more info in the next few weeks although right now, the exchange is the priority.

Weekly Feature Update: 
*We added support for 3 new coins: Darkcoin, Cannabiscoin and Nubits
*We added the ability to download an account statement in PDF and Excel with a detailed summary of your activity on Bitspark. 
Our Account statement feature came as currently the only way to prove your assets on the competitors Bitcoin exchanges is to take a screenshot of the webpage which is not professional at all if you need to prove your assets to a bank or a Real Estate agent etc. Now you can download this data and have it cleanly presented for whatever time period you want in a form with our company letterhead. Have a look here (
We continue to get some great media coverage and as always, keen to hear your thoughts on improvements!
The Bitspark Team.

WU are cheaper than other comparative countries here in HK and are location specific (center of Hong Kong its ~1.5-2.6%, elsewhere in HK it can be 7-9% via their agencies). 
However, we compete and beat them at every price point using Bitcoin :-) (we are 1% total fee, spot rate) and are generally half the cost to send money from HK to Philippines.   
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:57:49
We think so too mitchr4, we are utilising Bitcoin to solve real world problems now, not just talking about it. At the end of the day for sending money a user needs to interface with the fiat system somewhere along the line. 
We are providing our customers with the cheapest and quickest way to send money to their loved ones all enabled by Bitcoin and we are winning hearts and minds of people who see Bitcoin as just some speculative thing for traders :) 
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:21:08
Feel free to try us out if you are ever in Hong Kong and compare us to the competition, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised :) 
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:04:12


Hi all, 
Yes it is profitable and yes we are looking to bring costs down further. The total fee is 1% including our cut and Rebit's cut. It's all about volume and for us to scale quickly having our physical location at WWH is the best place for this, lots of foot traffic constantly. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 10:35:46
Is there a bitcoin ATM your family can visit nearby?
Although we can't help you at both ends right now, it's on our roadmap to do so. At Bitspark we specialise in easy remittances from Hong Kong to Philippines and Indonesia using bitcoin as the transfer medium. Hope you find a good US solution soon! 
What about localbitcoins at the other end?

The easiest (and cheapest, only 1.5% fees) way to get crypto in Hong Kong is through the new Bitspark x CalimexHK partnership.  Cash in, Cash out @ our first business Cash Point - Calimex in Sheung Wan.  Read more:  
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:55:09
Fees for cash in &amp; cash out are 1.5% at all cash points + any exchange you do in the app (crypto/crypto, stablecoin/crypto) is a flat 1.5% as well.
Here's some more info where we compare how this works to how Bitcoin ATMs work:[

Hi UScoin, 
This is what we do :). Send us an email at info and we can assist. Most of our customers are over the counter but can also facilitate Bitcoin only customers. Will be launching our services to online customers in the upcoming weeks.

Hi Coinish1, Yes we accept Local AUD Deposits and Withdrawals. The FAQ is something we will update today. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:09:01
I think we would look to target South Africa later this year once we release a solution for more currencies on Bitspark. Stay tuned. For now next up is Ghana this week and perhaps elsewhere in West Africa soon. Thanks!

Hi p76DGOoB9JAH, we are working on a system for merchants like yourself to be able to utilise the bitspark backend and we hope to have it done in the next 2-3months, send a message to info[at]bitspark.io and we can discuss further. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 02:29:28
Stay tuned :)
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:23:18
Yeah, this is what we are going for. Make it easy, make it compelling (cheap, referrals etc) and make it personal. Many of our customers do not have smartphones so an app is not appropriate to them, also many of our customers do not have bank accounts either and get paid in cash. So we need to have a physical presence in WWH and we are delighted to be helping people save money and time compared with in some cases lining up for 2 hours just to send money home. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:26:34
At Bitspark, we charge a $15 HKD flat fee at the FX spot rate. This compares with the competition at $20-25 HKD and anywhere from 0-2.8% spread over the FX rate. Hope that helps!
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:18:30
Bitspark here, thanks for the upvote of our remittance service. We serve both individuals and businesses a few shops down from the well known global companies like WU at half the price, quicker and to more pickup destinations than them to the Philippines and Indonesia.
We have some exciting plans for this year and we are glad to be providing a real world use case for bitcoin right now, not talking about but actually doing it :)
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:43:09
The rate is locked in and guaranteed using Bitspark. Not subject to volatility :)
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:28:18
Hi goldcakes, no we are not an Australian incorporated company and do not charge GST. We are not selling Bitcoin ourselves and we charge no trading fee. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:42:04
Indeed, our customers never need to know or understand how bitcoin works in order to reap the benefits of it there are many potential use cases! 
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:32:51
Longer term, sure, Bitcoin will continue to grow. But right now this is what you need to explain to someone to use BTC to send money: 
Find a local bitcoin exchange, 'get verified' with them (1 week), wire transfer money from your bank account (2-5 business days, if you have an account), learn how to use an exchange and what 'Bid' and 'Ask' mean then buy some Bitcoin, transfer it to a BTC address of your choosing where the person needs to do the above process again. 
Thats a very involved process and our customers just want to do what they're already doing- walk up to somewhere, hand over some cash and walk away knowing it's being sent home at the cheapest rate. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 13:51:37
Bitspark have had positive discussions with the Isle of Man gov for many months, we are making it clear that they don't need to 'fix' what aint broke...
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:18:12
There are a few key differences, to begin with, if you want to send with Cebuana, M Lhuhillier, banks etc traditionally you had to go to a remittance shop where they'd charge you a spread of 1-2.8% plus a 20-25HKD flat fee. Bitspark is a $15 flat fee, to all of the above pickup locations with the spread at the FX rate. So it's cheaper all around. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:40:01
See are above comment on how it works in the way you describe:
Find a local bitcoin exchange, 'get verified' with them (1 week), wire transfer money from your bank account (2-5 business days, if you have an account), learn how to use an exchange and what 'Bid' and 'Ask' mean then buy some Bitcoin, transfer it to a BTC address of your choosing where the person needs to do the above process again in their local country (may or may not have a btc exchange).
Thats a very involved process and our customers just want to do what they're already doing- walk up to somewhere, hand over some cash and walk away knowing it's being sent home at the cheapest rate. At Bitspark we make it cheap, convenient and personal and that's the way it should be!
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:34:38
We cover Hong Kong, Philippines and Indonesia and will be rolling out new destinations in the coming months!
