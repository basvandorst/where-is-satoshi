I should have said almost, rather than "pretty much".

Dude, everyone used to do doublespaces after periods.  Most people I know use two spaces after periods.

Ha-ha sorry. I thought about deleting before I sent that comment thinking you were being sarcastic. But I wasn't sure. Yeah, it does seem as people are just throwing garbage out there to muddy up the works and protect whomever SN may be.

I think David was one of the group that collectively was Satoshi, that's pretty much confirmed.  Wright was one of them too.  But there is at least 1-5 more possibly, as that trust made room for 3-7 people to control the trust.

yeah, but it could have been a pic taken at another time by karapeles, and this guy just inserted it into the convo to make himself look more believable.

He denied any past involvement in Bitcoin, Watch the AP video interview.

I think it's important to take into account that this man has recently had a stroke.  I'm not sure his responses could be taken seriously.  We don't know how minor or serious that stroke was.

I'm always impressed with the Christian Science Monitor's coverage.  I stumbled on them about a decade ago but didn't pay attention to them because of the name.  However after following them for over a decade, they always seem to be very accurate and on point.

Honestly curious, what is a better way of communication?

There's an argument  that goes something like, by creating bitcoin, he created value and therefore should be taxed.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:35:24
That, or he is Satoshi and just threw everyone, including the taxman, off of his scent.  I'm not saying that's true, but it would be a master stroke.

I think it's someone in their late 30s early 40s.  Bitcoin was a major undertaking of someone that's had time to dabble in a lot of different interests, has a strongly formed world view, and can also afford to just give it away.

The government basicaly said we're going to look into gambling in Second Life and evaluate how this effects Linden Labs' taxes unless you cease allowing gambling to US customers.  Linden Labs was conservative and just cut gambling off so that the IRS wouldn't be all over them.  This halved the economy in SL, but the economy in Sl for other goods was strong enough that SL could weather the storm.
Skill based gaming is still allowed in SL though.
