Why do people close the door when they take a shit? 
@_date: 2018-08-18 23:03:23
Only in California, legalize sitting in the streets? Oh no there's all this shit in the street should we make it illegal to shit in the street again? No, let's set up a poop patrol. WHATTHEACTUALFUCK. This is why they steal taxes from us?
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:37:35
Lol what you don't go to prison for declaring bankruptcy.

Difficulty rises accordingly don't worry. The more profitable it gets the more people get into it and the less money there is to go around, the hope is that the price will rise along with the difficulty. With as insane as this last run has been expect to make 15-20% less on the next difficulty adjustment and be surprised if it's less.

Do you know we didn't have net neutrality for the entire existence of the internet and bitcoin until 2015? You sound delusional 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:13:15
Up vote for DuckDuckGo because fuck google lol.

To be equal to slushpool which is at only 5.96% of hashpower you would need 44,796 of those s9's
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:55:25
Switch to slushpool or kanopool this doesn't really happen there and your not supporting some crazy fuck trying to steal bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:30:33
Yeah that's why blocks can hold more than that and if the people creating the problem started using segwit this would all end fuck off shill
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:34:35
So I'm not the only one! Like idc if it taking forever but don't give me the runaround 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:16:45
I like your spunk kid keep up the good stuff. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:59:52
It is not our proudest fact but bitcoins use as a currency is backed by criminal and gambling enterprises, for now. They gave it underlying value and we have brought in the speculation. You may not use it as a currency but there is plenty who do and its effectiveness as one is the only reason it gained traction.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:53:25
Why do we even need mods let alone more allow for the people who are trying to kill bitcoin to infiltrate the mod group and ruin this sub too
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:10:54
Control, like for the entire existence of the internet before 2015? We were so controlled back then omg yeah I couldn't do anything. LOL. Remember these are the people that brought you the Patriot Act, the Affordable care act, No child left behind, all of which were blatant misrepresentations as to what their actual intentions are so just think for a second about how that's exactly what they're doing again and no one ever sees though it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:16:13
Tattoo the words on hidden places all over your body and only you know the order
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:16:39
It's like in grand theft auto when you get a hooker then kill her right after. They got their BTC and their money back.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:31:10
They limit buys too
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:12:38
If your working is actually tracking you I think they would see you post you need to hide your drug activities...and if you knew enough about security to post here anonymously then you wouldn't be asking.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:38:27
And furthermore your post history doesn't mean shit, these shills have been showing they can buy/hack old account with established history.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:24:41
Step 1. Don't spell out your plan on reddit
2 Your work isn't gonna check the fucking block chain 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:19:55
lol bitcoin price moves too much for fake news to keep up
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:23:27
Download tor, find a decent website and for that 6 bucks you can get a membership to almost any porn site for a year. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:32:52
dude go look at the blocks, there is thousands of transactions that are smaller than the fee, this is a constant attack by all means.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:40:17
Goldman sachs has no intention of helping you make money in any market. How can they even pretend like they know what the fuck they are talking about when they barely do with stocks...
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:56:08
The government made it illegal to hold your gold coinage in 1933. You know what a lot of people did? They didn't listen.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:38:12
ding ding ding
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:39:32
clear shill account
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:43:12
But if more people were to use bitcoin as a currency instead of an asset it would stabilize.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:31:56
Hasn't Theil came out and specifically said bitcoin is what he intended paypal to be?
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:40:29
Bitcoin was ruled a commodity. Commodities are regulated. Bitcoin is decentralized but that does not make it immune from regulation.
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:42:31
What about all the other times in multiple different years he talked shit on bitcoin? Where is your snarky response to that.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:25:21
Oh yeah and even though its not bitcoin you should read Margin of safety by Seth Klarman. It is an investment bible. Don't buy it unless you feel like paying $800 as pdfs are easy to find. But still spend a shitton on crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:09:41
That only lends it more credibility. Don't worry the people that need bitcoin will continue to use it and the speculators will continue to speculate. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:00:25
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:10:15
It was always either too expensive or about to fail.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:16:47
did you find a solution?
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:57:35
Hey guys if you're really down with the cause buy some gold and silver to go along with your HODLings. A bunch of major banks got caught price fixing precious metals and the jig is up for now because china and Russia aren't gonna get dicked around like the population of the world and it never hurts to be safe. The gains are slower but the fact of the matter is if you had a $20 gold coin in the early 1900s it could buy you a new suit. That same coin today can still buy you a new suit(in terms of raw gold not even numismatic value). Just something to think about.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:00:10
What backs the dollar?
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:33:45
If you store on coinbase then you might has well have just stayed with money. They are no different than a bank except they have less regulations. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:27:52
It actually popped already as it was almost 3 times the market price last week.
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:13:56
If your gonna invest that much a year put at least 10k in gold/silver. As awesome as bitcoin is its just trying to be like the big boys. If you had a $20 gold coin in 1900 you could buy a new suit. That same coin could still buy you a pretty damn nice new suit(in just raw gold not even numismatic value).
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:21:50
It works the same if you go back 1000 years. You could have bought the most badass toga and a bunch of whores with that same coin.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:49:43
At this point the idea was fun and if the overlords want to use it at least I/we have some.
