You can hardly say that the internet is without flaws. The ability to widely and cheaply distribute misinformation, the invasion of our privacy, inspirational facebook quotes...
Bitcoin on the other hand appears to be mostly about gambling.

These analogies are pretty terrible, since they don’t accurately represent how the economy functions.

“In gambling the house always wins”
This is not true. If we each place bets on the outcome of a coin toss, there is no ‘house’ and the odds are evenly split between us, yet this is still ‘gambling’.
Even if we take a game like Texas Hold ‘Em, where there is an element of skill involved in the game, it is still ‘gambling’.
Finally when you take into consideration that the value of Bitcoin is heavily influenced by a few key traders, the extent to which you can say there is no ‘house’ is in doubt.
But what I was getting at was that in practice, people are using bitcoin as a form of gambling rather than as a form of currency. Yes there are a few places where bitcoin is used as a currency by enthusiasts, but ordinary people are not using it in this way, even those who are familiar with Bitcoin.
And I was not suggesting that the internet cannot be used for good, or that it is beneficial (I am of course using it at this very moment) but we should not ignore its problems.

Is there anyone interested in bitcoin who isn’t a believer in these strange economic theories?

What further context do you need, exactly?  
"The man is a violent criminal" - lists multiple arrests for assault  
"The man was leader of a far-right hooligan group" - He is the founder of the EDL, which are a far-right hooligan group. 
  
Instead of vague demands for "context", how about explicit critique?
