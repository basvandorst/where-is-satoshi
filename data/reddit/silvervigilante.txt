In the past year, discussion of Bitcoin as a currency or money has overtaken an earlier paradigm in which Bitcoin began to be interpreted as beyond money and currency. Like many argue that the US Constitution was written in an earlier time, say “before automatic weapons” or “equality,” and thus making it irrelevant, many individuals have noted the ways in which Bitcoin is actually a part of a paradigm outside the purview of money and currency. While containing most, if not all, of the characteristics of Aristotelian money, it also portrays Platonic interpretations of what money is, such as that the value of currency should independent from the material with which money was made. Thus, Bitcoin is both conservative and progressive all at the same time.
Instead of being seen as currency and/or money, Bitcoin can more accurately be seen as the distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or work loads between peers.  Once a p2p exchange comes online – and many programmers do believe such an achievement is possible – this will be truer than ever. This p2p exchange will transform a large part of the Bitcoin network into a near network of equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. These participants will support a peer-to-peer network of nodes.  Uncommon to the p2p world, Bitcoins’ nodes will not all be made equal. Nonetheless, with the support of p2p exchanges, Bitcoin begins to resemble a pure p2p network (assuming a p2p exchange is developed.), and more accurately, a futuristic p2p network.

Jeff, the presumption is trust of Spiegel. Spiegel noted this in their article, word for word: "What's more, even new, alternative currencies, as well as presumably anonymous means of payment like the Internet currency Bitcoin, rank among the targets of the American spies." In terms of history, that a mainstream publication has now made public it believes the NSA is interested in applying academic studies to to BTC, is one for the record. With all do respect of course ;) .

It's not just PayPal. Western Union, MoneyGram and others have commented on Bitcoin in the last week.
Laws such as the Money Transmission Act in California were put together by a group called The Money Services Round Table. The table is a shady political group that does not wish to reveal it’s identity. However, via the Freedom of Information Act, it is evident that its lobbyists met with the Federal Reserve in 2006 to formalize their vague monopoly. It’s members include:
Western Union
American Express
These companies wish to keep the act of transmitting value under their control. They are joined by some other big players that hold multiple money transmitter licenses:
Google Payment Corp.
American Express
First Data
Ruesch International Inc.
Western Union

The world is on the cusp of a new revolutionary era. Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan, Cairo, Yemen, Bolivia, Chile, Italy, Greece, Mexico, Iceland, US, and so on. What do all these nations have in common? Unrest.  This is the era of the “Global Political Awakening.” Although each nation’s budding revolution takes on its own character, it is largely caused by domination of western powers over the last 500 years.
This “Global Political Awakening” is the reason that Bitcoin has gone “mainstream,” as CovergEx Group Chief Market Strategist Nick Colas wrote about in a note to clients. Cited was CoinLab moving Bitcoin under the Federal Reserve System.

Let’s say that at $49 you had 1,000 ounces of silver.  And you kept it. You’d have 1,000 ounces of silver, valued in USD denominated terms at $27,500.
Now, let’s say that anytime between then and now, you moved just half of that silver into Bitcoin. Let’s look at your silver, now, as insurance on your liquid funds via the bitcoin protocol.
That 500 ounces of silver could have been $15,000 in value to about $300,000 now.  That’s assuming a $10 bitcoin price…That could have been as recently as January, 2013.
Now, let’s say you traded back into silver now, with premiums on silver products rising in price now. You could buy about 10,344 ounces of silver…

Time Magazine has defended the social viability for the spread of Bitcoin, proclaiming that “stopping the movement of [Bitcoin] will be possible only if countries are willing to impose harsh taxes and capital controls. Once alternative currencies are frictionlessly available on the Internet, every laptop will become its own Cayman Island.”
All sorts of characters have come out of the woodworks to take a swing at Bitcoin. As Bloomberg wrote:
Blockchain.info, a site that tracks data on Bitcoin mining, estimates that in just the last 24 hours, miners used about $147,000 of electricity just to run their hardware, assuming an average price of 15 cents per kilowatt hour … That’s enough to power roughly 31,000 U.S. homes, or about half a Large Hadron Collide

Like mistaking the true process of biological evolution, many mistake the ebb-an-flow of supply-and-demand as oozing steadily from the pipes of commerce. The truth behind human action is more complicated than that, and the Bitcoin price over the past week has demonstrated that.
On April 10, Bitcoin climbed to a high $266 and closed at $124.9 the next morning before Mt. Gox, the leading Bitcoin exchange and de facto bitcoin price-fixer, went down for nearly a day. This was the bubble heard around the world, as during this time Bitcoin was the talk of the financial world.
When trading began Thursday, Bitcoin fell again to a low of around $65, before rebounding to sit around $100 through Sunday night trading.
Bitcoin began the year around $13.51. It’s percentage increase fluctuating around 750%. It has outperformed all other assets Year-To-Date, with Natural Gas up 27% since Jan. 1. The green line on top, BTC, would have to be extended 5.5 times to show bitcoin’s 2013 performance.

The idea of crypto-currencies goes beyond the life of Bitcoin, for there are many sorts of similarly decentralized currencies born, in vitro or not even a sparkle in its founders’ eyes. Where one crypto-currency ends and another begins will prove to not be so clear.
Their varying traits will be diversly subtle. A common anecdote reads as such: let’s say you have an axe. Let’s say you behead a man with that axe one day and this breaks the axes’ handle. So you go to the store and buy a new hardware store handle to fit to the blade.
Then, one day splitting wood, you break the axe head. So, off to the store you go to replace the axe-head. Everything is again in the right place, until you arrive home to find…the man you beheaded. He takes a long look at the axe you’re holding and exclaims, “That’s the same axe which beheaded me!”
The catch is, Is he right?
This riddle goes back to at least ancient Greece, where the historian Plutarch asked basically the same question by telling a story involving an aging ship and an adventurous crew.
The riddle has been regarded by philosophers ondown through the ages as a dead end of sorts, since any given person’s answer hindges not on any actual attribute of the axe or ship in question, but on how the answerer chooses to define the word “same.”
So, if you deconstruct the Bitcoin code and then put it together in new, yet reminiscent patterns, do you have Bitcoin or something totally new?

BitPay has announced a capital raise of $2 million led by Peter Thiel’s Founder’s Fund. Max Keiser’s Heisenberg Capital was also a part of the capital raise.  Thiel, through Valar Ventures, also invested $6 million into Transferwire, a p2p online exchange around the same time.
What this betokens is the future of Bitcoin. This will be a future in which Mt. Gox and all the other usual suspects are no longer the main players of Bitcoin. This torch will be passed onto major transnational corporations whom already have Money Transmission Licenses and, in most cases, are operating in the US or were at least founded there.

The same is true for government and other institutions, like banks. In order for these institutions to continue operating in a world of big-data, they will need technologies like Bitcoin in order to operate as they have heretofore and with less concern for being caught than would otherwise be so.
Even in the case of Edward Snowden. If the NSA paid this contractor in Bitcoin, the NSA could take effective means to distorting the relationship between controllers of Bitcoin wallets, and possibly convince a court of law that the NSA has plausible deniability as to ever having a relationship of any sort with Snowden.

Bilderberg's esoteric deal-makings have put them at the center of the debate about who, what, where, when and why in the New World Order. Since their first meeting in the Netherlands in 1954, their storied history has evolved to become a popular meme in Internet circles.
Over the past ten years, thanks to the Internet, the notion that a shadowy network of deal-brokers manage the planet has taken root in the minds of the so-called "meddlesome outsiders."
If it is true, that Bilderberg is a key steering committee for what's termed the New World Order, then something very in particular will be on their agenda this year: Bitcoin.
It has already been leaked that one of the key topics to be discussed at this years' Bilderberg conference is big data and, alongside Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Eric Schmidt will be in attendance.
And what better context in which to bring up Bitcoin then in 2013 at Bilderberg with the Google CEO in attendance.  Not only does Bitcoin undermine the efforts of Big Data to consolidate information and store it via nanotechnology on-and-on forevermore, but Bitcoin also has the banking industry on edge.
A top US Federal Reserve official recently told an international conference that the US is weighing potential risk from online payment mechanisms such as PayPal and Bitcoin.
"We have been talking... with banking organisations over the last year or two, trying more carefully to understand what the concerns are with these new payment mechanisms," Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen said.
She was confident in the US regulatory framework to stifle free markets.
"In point of fact, at least in the United States, there are regulations that apply to PayPal and other payment providers," she told the annual International Monetary Conference in China's financial hub of Shanghai.
"But that said, this is very much on our radar screen and we are carefully trying to identify where the risks are," Yellen added.
So, if Bilderberg is relevant the managing of human society, then there is no doubt that this year at their meeting, they will discuss decentralized virtual currencies and their implications for the future of the world.
What they will have to base their discussion on is the fact that Bitcoin has come into play on the planet through the process of spontaneous order, and not command and control economics.
This makes Bitcoin one of most unpredictable phenomenon in the world.

The means by which we interact with this system – ethics and morality – breathe life into our socialness. When we discuss Bitcoin, we are not discussing a Bitcoin Standard. Stuff and things should compete as money. Some will be better than others. My refrigerator is not good money. But, other things such as pieces of paper, gold, silver and digital protocols can float openly on the market and whatever wins mainstream adoption will be “King.” The other stuff can remain in use. For now, cash remains “King.”
And this is true in a very real sense, and one that Bitcoiners will heed. But, we will detail that later. What GoldSilverBitcoin foresees in the future is an array of decentralized, competing currencies being used through technological mediums, namely the world wide “web.” We also maintain that Bitcoin can be added to precious metals to make a mélange of alternative financial instruments.

Article here: 
The government demands the turning over of your bitcoins. You've held them on an online exchange, so your stash is vulnerable. And, under the Patriot Act, the government maintains this authority.
The government doesn't need probable cause nor reasonable grounds to believe you are a criminal.
Instead, they're depending on Section 215 of the Patriot Act, a provision that makes it legal for the government to mandate the turnover of "any tangible things" from any entity as long as the items are for an investigation to defend against international terrorism.
To exercise Section 215, the FBI and NSA would not need probable cause, nor even reasonable grounds, to believe that the person whose records are sought is engaged in illicit activity. The government agency exercising 215 does not need to suspect that the subject is a foreign power or agent thereof.
Further, the FBI can investigate United States persons based in part on their exercise of First Amendment rights. That means, the government could spy on a person because they don't like the books he or she reads or because they don't like the web sites he or she visited.
Section 215 violates the Fourth Amendment, which states "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."
But, none of this matters. Once your bitcoins have been confiscated as "tangible things" can be, the only thing that will matter is that you weren't diversified.
That's why at GoldSilverBitcoin, we strive to put into the hands of bitcoiners the precious metals they need to have a diversified financial portfolio.

So, let’s be clear: 56.7577° N, 86.4196° W and 40.4230° N, 98.7372° W. In the former geographical coordinates, Bitcoin is free of banking regulation. However, in the latter, Bitcoin is not free from banking regulation.
The case grows increasingly murky in 32.9043° N, 110.4677° E, otherwise known as China. Perhaps the geographical coordinates of 35.1234° S, 71.5720° W – that is Chile – will keep with their recent history of laissez-faire economic policies and be kind to Bitcoin.
Or maybe one with bitcoins would be best off at 18.1667° S, 178.4500° E, far away from civilization in Fiji.
Although it might be difficult to know where Bitcoin’s safehaven will be, one thing that is becoming clearer is that those societies which do not adopt decentralized virtual currencies will not play a very important role in the molding of the world in the 21st century. The US, for example, has been its own worst enemy in its approach to decentralized virtual currencies. There is a lesson to be learnt for the US in the Canadian decision on virtual currencies like Bitcoin.
Just this Thursday a top anti-money laundering US regulator said  that the US is not working to clamp down on virtual currencies, though authorities expect exchanges and administrators for digital cash to comply with the same rules that apply to other financial institutions, what seems to be a guilty before-proven-innocent solution.
The regulators’ comment comes on the heels of charges brought against Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency site that is alleged to have laundered approximately $6 billion. Moreover, the Department of Homeland Security seized an account of keystone Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, alleging that it and a subsidiary were conducting transactions ”as part of an unlicensed money service business.”
With this past March came FinCen’s proclamation that it would apply money-laundering rules to virtual currencies amid growing concern that the equivalent of digital cash would be used to fund illicit behavior. This move strapped millions of dollars of overhead on many Bitcoin firms, placing them under the same umbrella as money-order providers Western Union.
So, thrust onto their lap was  registration with government, internal safeguards, bookkeeping requirements and mandatory reporting for transactions of more than $10,000.
“Any financial institution and any financial service could be exploited for money-laundering purposes. What is important is for institutions to put controls in place to deal with those money laundering threats, and to meet their … reporting obligations,” Ms. Shasky said. Ms. Shasky, who took over the top spot at FinCen in September 2012.
The Liberty Reserve case marks the first time the Treasury had invoked the 2001 Patriot Act against a virtual currency in an effort to choke off Liberty Reserve from the US financial system.
“With this action, we were not painting with a broad brush against an entire industry. I do not think that is fair to any industry in any situation, let alone this one,” Ms. Shasky said.
The US is losing the digital currency race. 
When Fred Ehrsam pitched his bitcoin-based startup Coinbase to more than a dozen Silicon Valley investors – you know, the ones who are supposed to know tech – he got blank stares. The reception in China has been much different. There, he doesn’t have to spend an entire meeting explaining the concept of digital money. Instead, he gets to tell them about his business.
“They said, ‘We’re sold on digital currency; we just want to know if you’re the right people,’” Ehrsam told International Business Times pacing from a windy San Francisco rooftop. “It was a very different starting point.”
Virtual currencies have been around in China. In fact, more than 100 million people on social network QQ have used the Q coin for over 10 years. Eventually, the Chinese government cracked down on it. Moreover, China’s state-run China Central Television, or CCTV, ran a half-hour-long documentary on bitcoin, leading to a spike in the world’s second largest economy of downloads of apps for processing and “mining” bitcoins.
Bitcoin still has lots of room to grow, as it has been heavily concentrated in North America in its incipience. To be sure, North Americans have lots to lose should they lose this digital currency arm’s race to, in particular, China.
What does it say about the global economic landscape that, in even China, where the ‘people’s currency’ is touted as playing a central role in the redefining of the global economic system, Bitcoin is gaining popularity.
An HSBC forecast projected that come year 2015, the yuan will be one of the three most used currencies in global trade, in league with the dollar and euro. China also already has agreements with Russia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan allowing trade to be settle din yuan instead of dollar.
Circulation of Global Payments – January 2013 SWIFT DATA 
1. Euro  40.17%
2. U.S. Dollar  33.48%
3. British Pound  8.55%
4. Japanese Yen  2.56%

The West is embracing the rise of China. London, Paris and Zurich have all made bids to be a preferred partner of China. Bloomberg reported that the Bank of England was poised to be the first Group of Seven nation to sign a currency-swap with the People’s Bank of China.
But, it is China’s history of currency manipulation that renders its’ currency untrustworthy.  Since China oversees the yuan under strict government controls, its mission of decoupling from US dollar debt can be seen in the management of its own currency.
Certainly, the Chinese people remember that, before 2009, the central government prohibited the export of the currency and its use in international transactions. They have experience with currency controls, and so they appreciate a diverse portfolio. That is why the Chinese are buying gold in record amounts, as well as silver, and also why they are taking to Bitcoin. The US is behind in these departments, just as they are behind in science and math in schools.  One of the US’s only hope is to pioneer decentralized virtual currencies, just like it pioneered and dominated the credit card industry.
