They at least make use of an escrow service and seem to have a vague idea of what their business model will be rather than making it up as they go along.
But... they're certainly less believable than even BFL was when they first announced their Single (1GH/s @ 20w).

Slightly off topic:
His business plan is not as big of a deal as it might seem.  It seems he has a contract with a third-party supplier and is not taking the manufacturing development risk... although it's not entirely clear.  This lack of clarity is a red-flag in itself.
In comparison, Largecoin seems to be the real deal, although they're not a huge jump in profitability even at half price.

Ah, I'm jealous of your electricity price.
There's talk that many are planning shut off their GPUs this summer and not turn them back on this fall, given the steadily increasing difficulty and impending halving of rewards.  Of course, as you said the value can always change...

Their mini-rigs are using different chips than the singles.  Also there is no indication that they are having trouble sourcing anything at this point.
@_date: 2012-04-04 03:12:39
It's interesting how this and Largecoin are set up so that the seller still has some control over the hardware.  I'm not exactly sure what to make of it, to be honest.

If you're paying for power, you're losing money, or barely breaking even.  Nvidia cards really aren't profitable.  Of course it sounds like you're just doing this out of fun which is fine too :)




At current difficulty and bitcoin price you're making about $12 per month if running 24/7
300W for one month is 219kWh which is ~$21 in electricity
Even just counting the video card you're still losing money.
Hopefully this is correctly calculated.

cgminer 2.3.1 compiled from source (did this just to get FPGA support, I don't have one yet though)
2 x ATI 5850 @ ~370Mh/s each w/ SDK 2.4 on Ubuntu 11.11
-I 8 -v 2 -w 256 --gpu-enginer 900 --gpu-memclock 300 --temp-overheat 85
I'd be interested in seeing if anyone gets higher Mh/s with those clocks on a 5850.
I'm getting a little over 2Mh/J from the entire system.  It's going to be interesting as GPUs become unprofitable, especially as newer cards seem get worse Mh/J and worse Mh/s/$.  I am a little bit wary of first-get bitcoin miner FPGAs at this point, especially with this mystery (probably botnet) miner with ~20% of the network.

I sold.  I sold all the way up this bubble.
The insane volatility makes taking consistent profit from mining difficult.   Therefore I put my money back into something more stable, USD.  
Don't worry though, it's all going to be spent on mining hardware at some point.  It's just hard to save for something when the price fluctuates 50% (or even 10%) in a day.

Because I've never seen a bank that doesn't take wire transfers.  I don't know how a bank would exist without wire transfers either.
Most credit unions don't have any charges.  It's just some big banks that charge (usually for incoming wires).

No, I threw away $150.  It's not valid to judge value in hindsight.
Of course, I was mining something like 1BTC per day back then.
@_date: 2013-06-13 21:30:50
Just to be the dissenting opinion here... but is this really the best way to advertise Bitcoin?
It screams unprofessional, doesn't explain itself, and the percentage of people who view it and 'get' the joke would be extremely small.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:54:31
It's fucking up the mining scene too.  
I've actually got some profit set aside to buy up used ASICs from overenthusiastic investors (mostly those who don't understand difficulty) when the price gets more stable, this might be 6 months or more from now though.  I mine for profit, but I personally plan for &gt;9 month payback times.

Pointing out issues with the Bitcoin implementation is statist?  Ignoring problems does not make them go away.

Test runs of any new way to sell/transfer/trade/buy are absolutely crucial.
I sent 24BTC to a random, incorrect address since I didn't do a test run.  Of course that was only about $150 at the time.

A 51% attack is not really something that's fixed, it needs to be worked around, actively considered.  The whole 'voting with your hashing power' is actually a pretty cool idea.  
However, needlessly pissing off a state is not a good way to go about things, especially as bitcoin is just starting.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:01:26


Do you not remember the drop from $30 to $2?

The specs you listed made me look up GDDR5 prices...
A very cursory look says 64GB of GDDR5 would be somewhere between [$700 and $1400](  Certainly not outside the realm of possibility even at this point.

There are an enormous number of legal, free streaming sites these days.  Not to mention pay sites.  Many more than when Napster was around.  
It'd be interesting to see the # of songs illegally downloaded per internet user over time.  I honestly don't know what the results would be, but it'd be very interesting to see.
To extend the analogy, if some drugs are legalized the market for Silk Road type sites will probably decrease.  Again, it would have been interesting to see Silk Road marijuana shipments to states that recently decriminalized or legalized marijuana.

Shitty headline edit, it's a alternative bitcoin implementation not a bitcoin alternative.
vbuterin seems to have some vested interest in driving traffic to Bitcoin Magazine, just look at his submit history.

I stopped mining and sold all my hardware last week.

If litecoin gets popular enough people will make ASICs for it.

51% attack by determined government(s) and it's all over.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:27:33


Electricity costs may be higher than profit at that point.  The difficulty is only going to go up.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:55:23
A mildly determined government could severely damage or destroy bitcoin with a 51% attack.

It's always fun to see the reactions of normal, non-computer, people to bitcoin.  My friends and I always get caught up in the aspects of mining, markets, missed opportunities, but we all have IT backgrounds.  
has actually gotten better about this, more posts about how to use bitcoins and fewer about 'ZOMG bubble sell/buy!' or whatever.  It's still filled with those posts right now, but not nearly to the extent of past run ups in price.  Particularly those cringe-worthy posts telling people to 'hold'  We will see, though, after the price stabilizes again how people react...

Welp, he's never getting out of jail.  It'll probably have a chilling effect as well.

I pre-ordered a while ago.
"I've heard good things" is not a very apt description for any ASIC manufacturer at this point haha.  Consider the Avalon and BFL price rises, delays, missed power targets etc.... but it's a new technology, growing pains are to be expected.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:57:59
I'll repeat what I've said elsewhere:
A mildly determined government could severely damage or destroy bitcoin with a 51% attack.  It's in most people's interest for bitcoin to comply with laws and regulations, or at least make some effort.
@_date: 2013-01-31 08:19:34
Yea, although while ASICs are coming online prices might get funky since the difficulty only adjusts every two weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:53:06
If individuals still can buy ASICs then it'll sort itself out.  I mean the argument that since 'casual' miners not mining is moot.  
Currently, I bet a huge percent of the network is professionals with dedicated mining rigs. How are ASICs different from that?  The barrier to entry with ASICs isn't huge (though certainly higher than a GPU).
What scares me is that people seem to be flocking toward 'hosted' or share-based mining.  One person hosting an enormous number of miners is a little scary.
Of course, it would be in that person's interest to not fuck up bitcoin, otherwise they won't make any profit and will be left with a lot of useless dedicated bitcoin hardware.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:39:23
Yea, it was a good time to get out.  I still sold my hardware for more than I paid for it.

Dwolla and bank transfers are pretty cheap.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:11:04
That's outdated.  I already have a BFL Single though.
Investing in more GPUs instead would have been more profitable for me, honestly.
