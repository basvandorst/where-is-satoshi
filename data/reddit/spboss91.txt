Judging by his ignorant response he seems to not be aware of how the UK spread its legal systems on a global scale.. A huge number of countries based their laws upon the UK's, especially the commonwealth.
Not bad for such a "tiny island".

I heated my entire home mining with my gpu's. I turned off the central heating because there was so much heat generated.
My utility bills were effectively the same as the usage balanced out, I paid more towards electricity and hardly anything for gas. I was basically mining "for free".

There is a company using blockchain to track formulated milk powder in china. This is after the scandal of counterfeit powdered milk that killed dozens and hospitalised hundreds of thousands of babies. 
The retailers using the chain are charged more than a traditional database, they are willing to pay a premium for immutable tracking and the parents are also willing to pay a premium as consumers to protect their children.
It's hilarious you said that with such confidence and got upvoted too. This is a real project that already exists and is indirectly saving lives.

If I am correct, Authy uses SMS as part of its 2FA authentication process. That is a major security flaw and I would never use SMS as any part of my authentication process, it's easily compromised.

That was me last year mining ethereum in my home. I turned off the gas central heating completely. My average bills were very similar in cost (more electricity but minimal gas usage).

At least a quarter of my trades have been on decentralised exchanges with no way of me going back to find my "trade history". This was right in the beginning, when I just started making investments.
Now I educated myself on the matter, I've backtracked my binance/coinbase trades and added it to blockfolio.
I'm not sure what I'll do when it's time to cash out. There's a whole chunk of data missing that I simply can't retrieve.
