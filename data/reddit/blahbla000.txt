Arbitrage bots maintain consistent exchange rates across currencies and exchanges. Without them, exchanges would be slower to react. Bitcoin would not be as effective of a method of international money transfer since BTC price might be different in USD and EUR for certain periods of time.

Arbitrage would still happen, of course, but it would be slower.

You understand that Apple has incentive to **not** store fingerprints right? They have no use for them in the first place, and getting caught handing over information against the wishes of their users is very damaging, and something they obviously want to avoid.
But they can't be forced to hand over something they don't have. So they have incentive to design it from the beginning in a way that can't be used against them. They've already said they don't actually store images of your fingerprints, but more of a verifiable hash.
Plus 3rd parties are generally all over new iPhones trying to find security flaws. Bitcoin may be open source, but there will be far more scrutiny over the new phone.
*And I think the biggest point to be made here... Why the fuck would it even matter? What is the actual use of fingerprints? So they can know you were in a particular location?

However, there are situations, such as a fork, that actually disincentivize taking the "healthy" route. In the case of a fork, either branch can be taken without destroying Bitcoin. The head developers preferred taking the 0.7 branch to prevent causing issues with people still on 0.7, but they could have just as easily chosen the 0.8 branch and forced 0.7 users to upgrade. Neither choice destroys Bitcoin, even though one is "healthier" for the system.
A miner, however, is going to want to take whichever branch he is currently mining on. Switching branches would lose him whatever rewards he's made on the current branch. Pools lost quite a bit of money in the last fork, but the central control of a few people was able to force them onto the "healthy" path. This isn't just a natural part of the system, and it isn't something you should expect to happen every time.

Pool operators are a small group of individuals who have a lot of control over this stuff. They forced miners to mine on the old fork. They only lost a small percentage of the orphaned blocks, since they are just pool operators and not miners. Their incentives are different from miners. Because there is a small group, they want to keep their reputation up by doing the "right" thing. This dynamic won't last as the system grows.
And my whole point here is that not every issue with the network is a clear-cut thing. There are issues that can arise that don't threaten the whole network, but still mess some things up. The fork could have also been "resolved" by taking the 0.8 fork. If the pool operators had not been around to force mining resources to the 0.7 fork, this is what would have happened. If this control over mining resources had not been so concentrated, miners would stay on the 0.8 fork, since it doesn't actually destroy Bitcoin or anything and it allows them to keep their rewards. It would be more profitable.
Miners follow the longest chain. It's not blind luck. They don't switch back and forth randomly between forks. They stay on the fork that profits them, which was 0.8, but they were forced by a small group of operators to move to 0.7.

This kind of thing is standard in these niche markets. Look at the Humble Indie Bundle and Linux donations for another example. Linux users always end up overpaying for these games since they have something to prove. They're trying to make Linux look like a lucrative platform to develop games for. But over time, the Linux donations have continued to fall and get closer to those of other platforms, because Linux support is becoming less and less of an issue. They have less and less to prove, and the original high donations were not sustainable.
*And I'm not talking about greed here, I'm talking about sustainability. Linux users obviously aren't doing this for greed; they also believe in what Linux stands for. So they did something unsustainable to try to prove their worth. The same thing happens in Bitcoin-land.*

Buy-in price is a purely emotional thing. If you have 1 BTC at $100, then you have $100 of value, which you are choosing to store in BTC. This is no different than having $100 and converting it to BTC. They can be converted freely, so choosing to not sell is the same as choosing to buy. You have a certain amount of value, which you are electing to keep in BTC.

I'm not sure I'm looking at the right transaction, but it looks like the rest of your BTC went to a new change address.
A transaction in Bitcoin has inputs and outputs. The inputs are the coins you've previously received, and the outputs are the coins you're sending. But depending on what size transactions you've previously received, your inputs may end up being bigger than the BTC you're trying to send. So Bitcoin adds an extra output to capture the remaining inputs. This is the change address.
(Example: Someone sends you 1BTC. You then send someone else .5BTC. Your previous 1BTC has to be broken into the .5BTC you're sending to someone else and a new .5BTC which gets sent back to yourself)
A lot of clients create a new change address for every transaction and then save it in your wallet. So the money should still show up in your Bitcoin client. It's just in a different address, but that doesn't matter.

If you consider the lifetime of the sun (11 billion years, so 6.5 billion years remaining) which is how long Bitcoin will last because it is distributed, and take just 1% of that (65 million years) times just 1% of the current size of the blockchain (11.5GB * .01 = 115MB), you can see that Bitcoin has an inherent value of $747.5E13.

The price fluctuates more than many stocks. And stocks can exchange ownership just like bitcoins. Bitcoin holds more similarity to stock than it does to most currencies. You own a share of the total pool of bitcoins and you transfer your ownership if you want.

Items sold for BTC are priced in USD. So the "product" is the transfer of a USD equivalent value from person to person.
However, the price does not represent the value of that product, since you can just convert USD-&gt;BTC send the BTC and then convert the BTC-&gt;USD. And the price of the BTC doesn't matter, as the same amount of USD is being sent.
This is way different from a product that is sold to actually be used, which would therefore be priced what the market is willing to pay. A lot of people in the Bitcoin community are buying BTC, holding, and trying their hardest to get people to dump their life savings into BTC. But these people aren't buying a product. They want to make money by getting people in the future to dump more money into the system without getting an actual product. Don't be so pedantic about the term "ponzi scheme". Maybe it's not exactly the same thing, but it has enough similarities to be concerning.

They don't take the fee if you cancel.
As for the bid price, if you want to buy immediately, you need to submit a bid above the market ask price. Basically, look at this table: 
On the left 2 columns are the people looking to buy. On the right 2 columns are people looking to sell. If you want to buy immediately, you need to base your price on the asks on the right, since those are the coins available for sale now. If you're willing to wait and take a risk, you can instead submit a lower bid price closer to the ones you see on the left. Your order is then added to the order book, and hopefully someone comes along and decides they want to sell immediately so they sell at the lower bid price. You have to consider how important the price difference is to you, and how worried you are about the risk of the price moving before your order is filled.
Edit: Also keep in mind, when orders are matched up the lowest of the two prices is what's executed. So if you submit a bid for $115, but there are enough coins available at $113, then you only pay $113.

I didn't say the guy is stupid. I'm sure he's quite smart. But there's nothing particularly impressive about the paper, other than the novelty of the application itself. It's a really simple paper.

I understand what you're saying. I really do.
The thing is, no-one is going to have all of their money in Bitcoin. They'll still have spending money in Dollars. I feel like your point really only works if Bitcoin is the **only** currency people use. But it isn't and likely never will be. So hoarding becomes an issue if people are disincentivized from spending, and then the value of Bitcoin is backed entirely by the speculation of savers. Probably not something that would bode well for the success of Bitcoin as an actual currency.

Keep in mind, banks have a large amount of data on what a stolen account looks like. They also have data on how you commonly use your account. Wiring money to an international money service probably just set off some alarms indicating a stolen account, or someone falling for a scam.
It's absolutely absurd to think they feel "threatened" over you sending a couple hundred dollars to some internet money website. They probably just see more people getting screwed by thieves and scammers than actual legitimate transfers to this place. They're carrying out their due diligence as a responsible company.
As for why BTC-e doesn't just open a US account, they most likely do not follow appropriate financial service laws. A lot of exchanges don't, which is why you see them getting their accounts closed. Everyone just wants to make a quick, tax-avoided dollar.
@_date: 2013-03-11 06:48:05
I feel like a lot of the demand for these kinds of services is artificial right now though. People want to spend Bitcoins to prove a point. It's impossible to measure this, of course, but I'm not so sure people's willingness to spend is so clear.
It's like how there are Bitcoin stores running at cost. This is clearly unsustainable and they're just doing it now so people can say "Look at how much cheaper it is to use Bitcoin", even though it's kind of disingenuous.

The phone app stores your primary password in plain text, relying on the sandboxing mechanism of the phone OS. And it doesn't support 2-factor. Your secondary 8 character password could be cracked.
My guess: You have a rooted phone disabling whatever sandboxing protections Android has (not personally familiar), and another app on your phone grabbed the cached encrypted wallet on your phone along with the primary password and sent it to the attacker. The attacker then bruteforced the secondary password.

You probably are leaving out the 0.6% (or 0.55% if you used a referral link) trade fee. You also are likely not considering market depth (though this wouldn't cause it to tell you that you don't have enough funds). You might not be able to buy that many Bitcoins at the best ask price, since a limited number are up for sale at that price.
Anyway, the X-Spend feature is for when you want to spend a particular number of dollars. Try that. It figures out all of the fee and market depth stuff.

It needs the key in plaintext. It could encrypt it with a password you provide, but at some point the key has to end up in plaintext to be usable. The whole point of the API key is that you can make one that is only capable of trading and not withdrawals.

If someone gave you 5 Argentine pesos ($1USD), would you try to figure out how to exchange it to your own currency? Would you try to find a store that accepts Argentinian currency? Would you research the economy of Argentina to see if it makes sense to convert some of your money to theirs?

It might not be drug money. Right now, when I spend my money, I know who gets information on my spending. I can choose my credit card company that I reasonably trust. They're only really one party and they have incentive not to just hand out my information to everyone.
With Bitcoin, every purchase is public. If names can be linked to wallets, it's going to be an issue.

What did you submit? They accept scans or photographs. It sounds like you submitted some digital file that you received in email instead of a scan of an actual paper that was mailed to your house.

That doesn't make this stuff sustainable though.
Right now, Bitcoin users have something to prove. Goodwill acts like tipping and donations are pretty obviously inflated by people trying to make an image for Bitcoin.
It won't last.

No, stop.
There is nothing about Bitcoin that implies it was created by a "group of top notch PhD cryptographers" or even one. Bitcoin is an application of existing technologies. It is a very novel application of existing technologies, and its creator is pretty clever, but what you're doing is worse than calling him a hacker. This just perpetuates all of the absurd shit on about how Bitcoin is some perfect gift from god and is destined to take over the world because it has literally no flaws and anyone who thinks otherwise is just an ignorant peasant. That's how you keep people away from Bitcoin.

You realize that's your fault, right? It's your responsibility to adjust your withholding allowances. The government doesn't know about your individual situation, you have to tell them.

A crash to zero would represent a critical failure in the protocol. Meaning you can't transfer Bitcoins anymore.
In other words. It is actually possible for Bitcoin to crash to zero, unlike pretty much anything else.

If the main devs privately decide to include such a mechanism, they can just include it in the compiled release which then gets signed as official.
This thief put his stolen funds in a web wallet. I doubt he compiles his Bitcoin client from source. Open source doesn't help there.

Imagine being a waiter in the US and receiving a tip in Euros.
Is it money? Yeah.
Can it be used to purchase things? Yeah.
Can it be exchanged for dollars? Yeah.
Are you going to be pissed? Yeah.
@_date: 2013-02-07 06:33:46
So you contacted them about it, right?
Why are you complaining without giving them a chance to fix the problem?
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:59:37
Seriously. It's like he forgot how there was a fork a few weeks ago causing all exchanges and payment processors to shut down. If something happens to the protocol it's impossible for exchanges to operate. If this persists, the price becomes quite literally zero dollars, as the BTC can not be exchanged, verified, or sold.

Miners are paid through inflation of the currency supply. The same way the government is paid.
People don't like to talk about it here, but Bitcoin is inflationary until the block reward goes away. The block reward decreases the value of the Bitcoins you hold.

Yes. And it used to cost something like 5 or 10 BTC...
So it changed. Hence "used to".

Wow, fuck you guys. Literally three people. Three people had orders cancelled. And you just accept their anonymous internet post as absolute truth.
It's like you guys **want** to make it difficult as fuck to start a Bitcoin-related business. They are by far the best service for buying BTC in the US, and you assholes are going to fuck that up.

Easy. For most people, the dirigible IS a scam, in that it has no apparent advantage over the hot air balloon or motorwagon.
(Replace dirigible with any of the millions of inventions that have failed to catch on. Remember, more inventions fail than succeed. Just because something succeeded once doesn't mean you have an argument proving that all things in the future will succeed.)
