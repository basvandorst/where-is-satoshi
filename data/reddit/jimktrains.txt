It takes a few days by law. It doesn't help that it was designed that way for that reason and no one wants to risk updating those systems.


Now remember your audience and ask the same two questions at a meeting of economist. (Also how many of those people who would raise their hand here for your first question actual, really, truely understand every aspect of the system. There will still be a bunch of people, but not nearly as many.)

Then the ops need to start autobanning.  Right now it's whenever they feel like banning someone.
I just don't agree with a ban on linking in general. I don't like their reasons and think the reasons are haughty, stuck up, and will prove to just cause more friction than help.
Also, banning people without any reason beyond "no links" is combative, I proposed a bot that would PM the person with the ops intents and to pm the ops to unban (or quite i proposed, but was ignored) and that idea  was ignored (too).

Thank you. I was apparently out-of-date with my information on bitcoin-qt/bitcoind.

:: shrug :: I'm also upset that the one mod I talked to felt like linking was lazy or a sign that you couldn't fully grok an article (which may be why you're talking about it in the first place! to try to understand) ("They demonstrate they have reading comprehension and they ask about the topic [being linked to]?") and that "There are *virtually no* stories that exist which convey useful information [into the channel]. Anywhere."
I get that they're under attack a lot, but putting users in a bubble isn't the way to solve that, as it doesn't teach them how to protect themselves. Especially by driving away users trying to find information (the op also says that ppl aren't driven away, but I don't believe that).
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:10:43
I'm not upset I was kicked.  I disagree with the principle of protecting users by not allowing urls because I think it's not effective and hampers the channel more than it helps.

Sometimes it's difficult to express a concept in a few words.
I didn't misunderstand plain english.  Linking is a basic piece of being online, it seems silly to outright ban it, so it wasn't the first interpretation.

There is a difference between being able to dump data and modify it. Granted we don't know about the later, it's just not true to say because someone found the data means they could modify it.

This isn't really an attack, is it? I mean, the money still gets from who it's suppose to get from to who it's suppose to get to?
It's only an "attack" if your wallet software doesn't validate against the recommended (iirc: to_addy, from_addy, amount, time-in-tx), correct?

It's a breach of contract, not the law. 
@_date: 2012-09-26 15:28:06
You're right and credit cards aren't a currency. It's vastly easier to just cancel a transaction deemed fraudulent and let the company go through standard dispute channels instead of the legal system. 
This thread is about comparing the transaction procedure for btc to CC so I was bringing up some differences and you brought up others.
EDIT: Also, I wasn't talking about fraud from merchants, but someone stealing credentials and making fraudulent purchases.  Also, sometimes things just go wrong, even with an established merchant.  The CC system isn't the best, but it's better than having to use the legal system every single time.
EDIT2: Yes, I know if someone gets your (real or BTC) wallet your SOL.  BTC are like cash, not credit cards, so it's pointless to compare the transaction mechanisms for them. 
@_date: 2012-09-26 12:06:11
It also doesn't support many of the features that the CC network does.  Don't get me wrong, I love BTC, but it's not apples to apples.
What features would I be talking about?
* Authorizations without Capture
* Fraud detection
* Refunding fraud
* Interfacing with multiple financial institutions (specifically not something BTC is meant to do, but this adds tons of complexity to the CC system)
* Over 30 years old and grown organically (again, not really something to strive for, but this adds tons of complexity to the CC system)
* Compliance with various nations account and financial transaction laws
I really think that not being able to detect or refund fraud (from the consumer's POV, the seller could just start another transaction, but the consumer cannot cancel a BTC transaction) will be an issue as BTC becomes more widely used.
@_date: 2012-09-26 19:29:13
My guess is that eventually a few reputable "banks" (i.e.: "cloud"-based wallet services) will appear and theft of wallets won't happen on such a grand scale.  Trojans already exist to do what you described (key logging).
What will happen, like with cash, is that financial services around BTC will become the object of theft. (e.g.: Credit and Debit Cards (though why a debit card would exist is beyond me other than to tie multiple institutions and instruments together or something...?).
@_date: 2012-03-15 02:51:03
That doesn't make it illegal.

One could argue that CCs have "almost no fees" BTC should and will have transaction fees.  It'll be the only way to make mining profitable at some point.
@_date: 2012-09-26 11:56:32
You have to remember that this system has evolved organically since the 80s, and has to support a variety of systems that weren't designed to integrate with each other.  It also has to abide by many different nations laws and be able to allow consumers to charge-back or report fraud and have that dealt with.

"Bitcoin, like any other speculation, for example stocks and forex, one needs to assess the risks firsts and should ideally not be investing more than they can lose. Especially because the bitcoin market fluctuates so rapidly at this point."
"Bitcoin, like fiat currency, has no intrinsic value. With the USD, people accept it because of the government and it's history. With Bitcoin, people accept it because they've decided to accept the equivalent of cash, a near-anonymous, easy to accept commodity, online."
"Bitcoin can be used to buy an always expanding range of products, such consume electronics, and services, such as webhosting, and consultants. Just recently OKCupid announced that it will accept bitcoin as well."

It was also the interviewee's tone that upset me. Yes, it's been bubbling and yes if you don't have the money to and/or don't know what you're doing, don't speculate.

While I agree with this, I believe it's a first step.  The more people who accept bitcoins and then convert it to dollars means that more people accept bitcoins.  The more people that accept bitcoins, the more likely it is that someone won't need to convert to USD to use their bitcoins.


Actually, that is part of the currency.  A bitcoin transaction can't be undone (baring chain splits and similar).

I wonder what other verification features could be done with credit cards.  Obviously a Kiosk to get Track 1 and 2 data would be a bit better.
By bigger concern is things like the FTC stepping in (


I'm not sure how the law works if you kept a per-card daily limit well below $10,000.
EDIT: If the legal end isn't too difficult for exchanges of less than, say, $1k per card per day, and some other reasonable amount under $10k per card per month, I could see ways of getting this to work with reasonable well ( and/or mailing the address provided with a confirmation code).  I have some experience working with processing credit cards and would love to work on a project like this if anyone is interested.  Again, the biggest hurdle would be the legality of running a (low-volume) exchange and what types of forms and other overhead it'll require.
