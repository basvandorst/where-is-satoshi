Bitcoin deserves to hibernate this winter...look at all those transaction blocks!
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:52:06
Follow your instinct
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:42:12
Oddly specific...
@_date: 2019-11-07 00:25:43
That's great until the business closes unexpectedly and takes your Bitcoin with it
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:07:14
Is that a whistle ?

He's beating up the dollar menu at McDonald's
@_date: 2019-08-26 21:03:02
As much as I'd like you to be accurate...
Most people don't give a Satoshi about using Bitcoin...and try telling someone they have to use keys, side chains, and their money could be hacked unless they buy and learn a seperate hardware device. Oh, and the value of your money fluctuates 5% per day....
Just saying we're very early...

it's entirely possible that somebody bought Bitcoin a few years ago and paid the equivalent of a few dollars to buy that advertising spot...

Only the cookie, the mustard he stole from Harvey's
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:52:07
It will realistically take many decades of price discovery before it is stable. Anyone in Bitcoin now is still so early in that process. Having said that, historically over time the metrics seem to point to a bright future.
@_date: 2019-12-11 09:29:46
I wonder if he gets raises that at least keep up with inflation... that's the real 1%

@_date: 2019-12-25 18:46:48
I bought at 7.1k, then immediately sold at 7.2k so I could buy some of Peter Schiffs gold cufflinks. You know, something with actual utility. People tell me all the time how amazing my cufflinks are.
