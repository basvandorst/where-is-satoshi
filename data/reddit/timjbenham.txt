Received one to a throwaway that I had previously used only to register with bitcoin-24.com

I thought SR was pretty wild. How wild can it get?

Looked at paying for some VPN access with bitpay a few weeks ago. I would lose about 10% relative to the current mtGox price. Ended up using Paypal.

Bigoted article. What is "unsavory" about SR and SD? AFAIK they have cheated no-one. What is unsavory are the persons and institutions who initiate violence to stop consensual transactions.

I'm glad you do have the slightest idea at least. If you didn't even have that you would be stuck!
You could try bitpay on your website. Or bitmit offers an eBay-like service for 1.9% commission.

I just resubmitted (previously rejected) and got 14,840. So the queue has grown by about 660 in 12 hours. That probably represents a slow down.

Depends on how large a premium you consider huge. Omnicoins claims their fee is 6-8% and ziggap works out to about 6.3%+$1.5. Or you could try selling shit on bitmit or SR...
The cheapest way appears to be to buy with a hacked paypal account on ebay.

My USD wire withdrawal (to au) of 13/06 has not been processed.

Selling coupons and pre-paid cards is smart because (a) it locks the customer into purchases down the track and (b) there is always a certain amount of customer lossage which means free money for the retailer. BTC has neither of those advantages.

What I want to know is why is Mt Gox trying to smear bitcoin?
