Your hatred of the metric system is just confusing everybody in the rest of the world.
I will personally refuse to do business with anybody who insists that 1µBTC=1 bit. The potential for confusion is just too great, since I already consider 1 bit to represent the Satoshi base-unit.
The term "mike" is much better (short for microbitcoin).

There is no long-term solution. Bitcoin is an experiment in using "Proof-of-Work" to secure a public transaction ledger.
If we want this experiment to succeed, we have to remind people to not point their hashers at pools with more than 30% of the mining power.
If for some reason this is impossible (going against human nature, perhaps), then the experiment will fail. I would be good to know sooner, rather than later, I guess.
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:07:22
You only think the analysis is rational because you agree with it.
It has a flaw: An entity controlling over 50% of the hashing power is a central point of failure. (Re-reading the post, I see it actually mentions that).
IMO, rational hashers should not point their equipment at any pool with more than 30% of the hash-power. That way, at least 2 pools need to collude to cause serious trouble.
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:56:58
I think with the new-found popularity of this term, sending 100x less than expected is more likely: since bits obviously represent the base unit of 10nBTC.
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:36:06
You can not work around "proof-of-work" without destroying the currency.
Proof-of-work assumes there is some competition in the mining space.
It is not about honour: it is about making it expensive to cheat the system. Ghash.io has made themselves a central point of failure.
If we want to make sure that at least 2 pools must always collude to sabatoge the network, we must be wary of any pool with more than 30% of the hash-power.
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:33:02
Bitcoin's innovation was to guard against malicious updates to the block-chain by requiring a "proof-of-work". This allows the validity of the block-chain to be verified in a trustless manner. The "proof-of-work" assumes two things:  
1. That people are generally good. (Bitcoin also makes is so that cheating in-system is more expensive than being honest.)  
2. That competition will ensure that no miner gets a substantial market-share. (If your business relies on bitcoin, it makes sense to invest in a full node or pay somebody to do so).
Pools having greater than 30% of the hash-power breaks the second assumption. 30% is the magic number because one of the pools may be run or coerced by a malicious person: we would not know until it is too late. Edit: [How A Mining Monopoly Can Attack Bitcoin]( explains that the magic number is actually 25% due to the selfish mining attack.
**"Proof-of-work" is not something to be worked around.** When you participate in the BItcoin network, you have to accept that it is a valid way to form consensus. There are no known alternatives that are still decentralized. Evidently, it is not known if "proof-of-work" can stay decentralized. However, if decentralization is not possible with "proof-of-work": that means that the experiment failed, and that Bitcoins are worth approximately $0.
**I see only only one solution**: hashers need to start avoiding pools with more than 30% market share. Pools with more than 30% market share need to start raising fees.
A related solution mentioned in the thread:  [let miners point their cex.io ghs to the pool of their choice.](
That would do two things:  
1. Prove to people paying for cloud-hashing that they are actually renting out equipment, rather than participating in a ponzi  
2. Reduce the market share of your pool.
As others have mentioned, controlling the majority of the hash-power makes you a target: be it from law enforcement, criminal organizations, or crazy bitcoiners who like DDOS attacks.

The term "mike" is much better (and is short for microbitcoin).
Sort of like how a "cent" is short for a centidollar.
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:43:18
I voted you back up, but you are still wrong.
Controlling more than half the mining power breaks the very design assumptions of BItcoin. If it contiunes, Bitcoin will be worth something approaching $0/BTC faster than you expect.
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:40:25
A bit is an indivisible unit. In Bitcoin, that is the Satoshi.
The term "mike" (short for microbitcoin) would eliminate much confusion.

I think that if there is an agreement to try to keep the UTXO set to say, 16GB, miners will have no problem delaying low-fee transactions that add to the UTXO set.  If the fee is large enough, it should compensate the miners for maintaining machines with 32GB of RAM.
TL:DR: it does not matter if *every* miner cooperates. Even 30% of miners can have an effect on the fees for high-priority 
Edit: they can even bring back free transactions if they reduce the UTXO set.

I think BCH is the technically superior fork. The risk is if the market disagrees temporarily or permanently.
I find the situation similar to the VHS vs Betamax thing.
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:07:30




IMO, segwit was the poison pill: designed to halt (on-chain) transaction growth, and by extension, user adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:54:40
What exactly do you think UXTO stands for?
The biggest problem is that it is being activated with a soft fork: such that half the nodes may be using one set of rules, while the rest may be using another. I have seen numerous guides explaining how to fake the segwit signalling: even on nodes that have no idea what segwit is.
I am seeing two contradictory messages from the segwit proponents:  1. the block space can be saved by moving transaction onto the "segwit" side of the chain. 2. That transactions will be verified. 
You can't have it both ways without risking a repeat of [July 2015](
If the UXTO pool grows too much, such that storing it in RAM becomes uneconomic*, miners will simply demand higher fees for transactions that create more outputs than they destroy.
*Currently, my bitcoind (ABC) is using only  1156MiB of RAM.

@_date: 2017-08-07 03:13:20
 I figured out a simpler reason for AXA to push segwit:








[Segregated Witness Benefits](
As adoption grows, it is only natural that the UTXO table would increase. Not only do you have more users, but the old users may want to split their coins as they grow in value. 
The *whole point* of segwit is to make coin splitting expensive, and by extension, on-chain transactions risky. (I personally don't really trust my computer with more than about $1000).
UXTO outputs appear to be less than 600MB at the moment. Any computer made this decade can handle it.
The Patent theory was a little problematic anyway: not all jurisdictions allow software Patents.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:51:51
Reducing UTXO growth is the only thing Segwit is actually the best solution for.
Therefore, it is not much of a leap to conclude that is the *true purpose* of segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:03:04
At the risk of talking in circles:
If it doesn't cost the miner much of anything, it is not a big problem.
IMO delaying the more "expensive" (net UTXO creating) transactions will be enough. You don't need full miner consensus to achieve that.

Bitcoin Cash is better because it tries to do one thing well: act as a secure, pseudonymous, distributed, resilient, consistent ledger for exchanging virtual tokens.
Monero offers strong privacy and automatic blockchain scaling, but at the expense of being very computer intensive:
      PID USERNAME    THR PRI NICE   SIZE    RES STATE   C   TIME    WCPU COMMAND
    39364 monero       19  96    0 33994M 17388M CPU5    5 2880.4 334.47% monerod
    45902 abc          60  20    0  1172M   671M uwait   1  90:57   0.00% bitcoind
As you can see, Monero uses 33.2 GiB (virtual, 17.0GiB actual) of memory, while Bitcoin (ABC version) uses only 1.15GiB (virtual, 0.655GiB actual) of memory. Edit: the CPU use is simply mining load.
Not very familiar with Dash. I heard they are similar to Bitcoin+coinjoin. They appear to use a convoluted (X11) hashing algorithm.
The problem with Etherium is that they try to do *too much*. They claim the "contract is law!". then roll-back if somebody finds a bug in one of those contracts. Cryptocurrency tokens should not be Turing Complete!
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:44:16
Bitcoin is high-risk right now.
It is stupid to say, with certainty, that it will out-perform the stock market "for the rest of the year".
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:25:38
If they are getting rewarded, then those transactions are obviously paying for the service.
My point is that if it costs more to process the transactions than the fees provide: the miners need no special incentive to ignore the transaction. Miners can even drop a hint through the block-chain: by allowing no-fee transaction if and only if they consume UTXOs.

Segwit seems to be a complicated solution looking for problems to solve like:
* Quadratic hashing mentioned above
* Lack of block space (BCH used the obvious solution)
* Transaction malleability (don't need a parallel chain to solve that).
I don't think it is a bad thing to copy the actually good ideas.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:50:44
I recall in the early days, when Bitcoin was just getting value, that detractors called it a scam as well.
From my point of view, the low prices are almost too good to be true: I am basically betting that the market will only be "wrong" temporarily.

Monero is actually good; so wouldn't fit the joke.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:05:40
Or, once the UTXO pool becomes problematic, miners may make it known they will charge extra fees for transactions consuming fewer UTXOs than they produce.
It does not even require a soft fork, though client software should be aware of the new fee structure.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:43:05
No, the whole point of Bitcoin is to track UTXOs. By restricting those, you restrict Bitcoin.

The B-money paper specifically points out:


solution to a previously unsolved computational problem. **The only
conditions are that it must be easy to determine how much computing effort
it took to solve the problem and the solution must otherwise have no
value, either practical or intellectual.** The number of monetary units
created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a
standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours
to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3
standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer
on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that
problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.

Pretty much.
I personally see Bitcoin as a long-term investment, so don't worry about day-to-day transactions much. I obviously disagree with whoever chose the "cash" moniker.
I am a big-blocker, but did not think fees were out of hand. My high-priority transaction fee to sell BTC for BCH was only about $1 in fiat equivalent. A wire at my local bank would cost $50, and probably* take longer.
*No confirms on my BCH yet.

Those numbers are based on BCH having approximately double the network capacity of Segwit BTC.
If the capacity is actually used, then yes, there will be market demand (that was a tautology).

Because that is the *whole point* of bitcoin. Rasberry Pi 2's can't handle it, they should step aside and let a machine with at least 1GB of RAM handle it.
We are in the "early adopter" phase. Temporary exponential growth is to be expected. If you remove coin validation as the primary purpose for bitcoin, it is not Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:09:08
I was referring to limited awareness and market-share; coupled with properties that seem "too good to be true". In the case of bitcoin cash: transactions can be cheap because computing power is surprisingly cheap (network and storage not so much though).
BCH changes are actually more conservative that the Bitcoin Core changes (ie: changing fewer things at once).
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:49:49
Transactions consist of a series of inputs that are consumed to produce a series of outputs. If outputs are restricted in some way, you obviously have fewer coins, which implies fewer coin holders.

I have been thinking about this for a couple of days; and started wondering: are these actually capital controls disguised as consumer-protection legislation?
Wire Transfers are one of the few irreversible transactions that banking system has. As far as I know, it is also the only (legal) way to send more than $10,000 in one transaction. It is unrealistic to expect the International Banking network to suddenly make wire transfers reversible just because new regulation (not law) in the US says so.
This means that International Wire Transfers are essentially barred. As a concequence, transfers over $10,000 are essentially barred as well.
What is interesting is that the OP's bank has apparently found a work-around. They simply have to hold the wire transfer for 30 minutes. Since wire transfers are famous for intermediate banks tacking on fees: the OP's bank eats those as well (raising the price enough to cover it 97 times out of 100).
