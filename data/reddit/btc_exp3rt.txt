What's the problem then?

Chinese pools don't know what to do to pump the dying Litecoin anymore.
@_date: 2015-07-13 11:49:25


Oh god, here we go...
@_date: 2015-07-19 04:00:19
Or in the genesis block.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:58:04
Already tried that and didn't work. Time to use the ban feature.

Or maybe you are not qualified to understand what he's saying, so it sounds like buzzwords to you.
@_date: 2015-07-19 10:19:19
Doesn't work very well. One of my accounts got ranked very high for a match that is wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-11 18:44:43
LTC was just a pump executed by its creator and now it's back to normal.

Oh look the buttcoin trolls suddenly like "alternative systems".
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:17:53
Don't name it!

And what are the site bans for? Spam/disinformation sites like Coindesk should be banned.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:59:02
Banning spam/disinformation is not "censorship".

Use Coinbase only for buying. Take your coins out as soon as you buy them, and be free. Or avoid Coinbase altogether like some of us do and buy through Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:14:44
Some wallets let you choose the inputs I think.

Only educated Argentines. Ignorant ones are still wondering why everything gets more expensive every day, and still voting for the same politicians that make them poor.
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:17:01


Can we stop with this meme already? It's not the people who make the mistake, and it's not even a mistake. It's politicians, who benefit directly from doing this kind of thing, so I don't know why you expect them not to do it.

So if someone posts 99 spam articles and 1 non-spam article, it should not be banned because think of the children?

He said he can *save* 193 USD per month. Sounds like he's in the top 1% of humanity.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:56:22
Yes please. This should have been done long ago.
@_date: 2015-07-12 04:53:20
301 Wealth permanently moved from fiat to Bitcoin.

Haven't you heard of There are people who dedicate their lives to hating a technology. They spend more time here than normal people spend working.
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:19:02


Ah yes, classic Argentines.
@_date: 2015-07-10 18:45:32
you have some explaining to do...
