So what if the establishment wants to get on board? Give them enough rope to hang themselves. We want them to open that Pandora's Box.
I do think it is important to support dark wallet though.

I doubt anyone is buying bitcoin just to spend it, even if discounts are offered. If anything it will hurt the price as newegg exchanges to USD. But realistically at this point the retail market is pretty much irrelevant either way.

I love when they give a timeline like this.
Bitcoin has the network effect. Bitcoin is good enough and where its not, it can adapt. It is not going anywhere.

Seems most people are put off by the very notion but I look at it as just the next evolutionary step -- a wholly natural progression in the human condition that we are on the vanguard of.
@_date: 2014-10-23 04:26:24
From what I can tell none of the bitcoin online auction sites have been able to get the network effect needed or deal with the compliance costs of escrow.
This is why OpenBazaar is needed.

Cool, put it in cold storage if you intend to hold onto it for a while, the easiest way is probably to create a paper wallet at bitaddress.org or on the coinbase site 
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:43:57
It is going to take many years to build the ecosystem. Most retail operates on very small margins, and currently they have to pay the vast majority of suppliers/employees/other expenses in fiat. 
That's why its good to support companies like Overstock, which has pledged to hold a certain % of the BTC they receive and find ways to incorporate its use in their business going forward.

You have to send it from the changetip site to your mycelium public address. (as opposed to the private key, which is used to prove ownership of the coins associated with that address). 
I assume that is how changetip works, I've never actually used it.

People don't like it is because it promotes the use of stolen credit cards.

They are adding bitcoin (or at least having the option to easily do so) through Braintree eventually

Considering it is a paradigm-shifting new currency not backed by any central institution, I think Bitcoin has done very well for itself in its relatively short time.

Yes it works with prepaid VISA/Mastercard (not Amex). 
It is definitely a step in the right direction.

Agreed. Gox set us back at least a year.

They do take it. It's listed on this page:

I prefer to give to: 
The wayback machine and music archive are great plus they say they even pay some employees with bitcoin, furthering the ecosystem, as opposed to wikipedia who won't even post a public wallet address.

OK I just remember people complaining about having to fill out personal info to donate.

The cause of the rally is bitcoin was way oversold.

These ones are pretty good if anyone is inclined:

Getting the brand in front of tens of millions of people, who are already engaged in online commerce, can't hurt. Plus, more places to spend gives the coin more value in most people's eyes. 
Even if it is automatically converted to USD it is just a necessary step in the development of an entirely new ecosystem. 
I think we'll eventually see mainstream adoption, not necessarily driven by Bitcoin innovation, but rather the ineptitude of the world's politicians and central bankers. All it will take is a small disruption in the financial markets. Just look at what happened with the price after the Cyprus bailout in March 2013. They're playing with a house of cards.

Who exactly do you want to add this checkbox? Web wallets like blockchain.info? They're not going to go for that. 
I would contribute some bits in a 1 day "money bomb" for them. It would help if there was a specific target and an automatically updating ticker. It would probably have to be set up by the devs themselves to be successful. I do think this has great potential to become the "killer app" we need and thus is worthy of support.

I think it will definitely happen eventually. They never gave a specific time-frame for implementation. Let's see where we are by January 1st.

Expedia, CheapAir, Dish Network, Menufy, third party services Gyft and Snapcard

Everything is relative. Relative to credit cards and checking accounts its a tool for freedom. Those tools are already inextricably linked to identity, not just theoretically. And of course they will never completely control the base unit like they do with fiat.

I think people get the wrong idea when they're bombarded with information. It takes very little technical know-how to safely store your own coins. Bitcoin -- be your own bank!

I perfer"digital" currency. It implies universality without needing to explicitly state it. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:21:47
As far as I understand it, any encryption threat to Bitcoin would be a threat to the entire banking sector as well. 
That said from what I've read quantom computers are still a long time away if it is even doable at all.

Anti-money laundering laws are a bitch but you can quickly and easily buy bitcoin anonymously through localbitcoins.com -- you just have to pay a premium for the privilege. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:31:32
Well it depends on the worldwide proliferation of bitcoin exchanges and what kind of rates they offer.
If bitcoin ever becomes universally (or near-universally) accepted, and all middle-men are cut out, then yes, remittances and the like will become much cheaper.
But right now I'm skeptical of huge savings if one has to deal with local currency exchanges on both ends. Hopefully Bitpay, et. al will prove me wrong.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:47:55
Unlikely this has anything to do with an upcoming retail event or proposed regulations or any other specific reason. Bitcoin was simply way oversold.

Thanks, looks like pretty cool service - I'll pass it along outside this sub.

Simplest and most obvious explanation: Bitcoin trolls are liberals whose ideology is threatened by its increased adoption. That is their motivation.
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:40:10
Agreed. I think the current format is fine. Most people are not so stupid or intractable that decimals will scare them away.
It is still early on but it is not so early that a change like this would go over smoothly. Because even though few own it, most (in the U.S. at least) know what it is and almost certainly have a basic idea of the unit ratio. To upend that now would needlessly cause confusion and set adoption back, IMO. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 04:32:26
So if the bitcoin business owners are fallible, corrupt humans, what does that make the people drafting the regulations? Are politicians, lobbyists, and bureaucrats sort sort of angels?
@_date: 2014-11-15 08:20:30
Agreed 100%, bitcoin needs dark wallet if it is ever to go mainstream. People and businesses won't and shouldn't be expected to give up their financial privacy, and for perfectly legitimate reasons. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:19:04
Payment processors like Bitpay, Coinbase and snapcard have received a good amount of funding.
I think the future is in open-source collaborative efforts like OpenBazaar, because for the first time there is a technology that allows for the elimination of the middle man, and the competitive advantage this provides is enormous. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:08:14

We don't currently have that in the U.S. You can walk into a 7-11 and buy a VISA gift card with cash or send a Western Union, but no bitcoin. There used to be BitInstant, which used Moneygram, but they unceremoniously shut that down a year and a half ago.

Gotta have patience. Uber and airbnb (and other Braintree companies) should be coming on board very soon. 
Braintree being a PayPal subsidiary, that could lead to very big things, because if and when Paypal itself incorporates it (as the CEO has indicated will happen), it will be a game-changer that forces their competitors' hands (namely Amazon).
