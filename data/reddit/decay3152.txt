I’m a small investor and believer in btc but at the rate it’s going at I highly doubt that.

I’m not saying it’s not possible. I just mean that it was waaay over valued. There will come a point where all the fomoers with weak hands come and go and hype dies down. Which I believe will cause the growth becomes slower and more consistent. I do hope you’re right cause like I said; i am invested but i just don’t think it will happen.

Kinda with you on that one, but I’m very optimistic on crypto so i definitely don’t have weak hands. That’s all you need while you absorb and learn as much as possible.

You guys talk like there’s some formula and you’ve got it all figured out. It’s ALL speculation! And I’m just giving my opinion. I do believe in crypto and think it has a huge chance of taking over. What doesn’t make sense is people just tossing numbers around and making predictions on something that simply can’t be predicted in the long term. All this does is invites more people into the market (that don’t understand the technology) that think they’ll be flying to the moon in their lambo tomorrow. People who freak out and sell when ever there’s some slight dip or fud being spread. 
Ps. Definitely aboard the train.

I’m not saying I’ve got it figured out. Notice how I never gave a price prediction? I also said that it is possible for it to reach 50k, and I hope it does! I just don’t think it’s likely. 
I get why people want to think btc is going to do really well. I think that’s why so many people appeal to John Mcafee cause he’s a huge “bitcoin to the moon” promoter. Can’t wait to see him chop his dick off..

Don’t get me wrong, I do believe it has room to grow, I just mean it became overvalued in such a short period of time. A lot of the money was people trying to make a quick buck. If it wasn’t, then we wouldn’t have had the huge correction that we had. of course some of it was fud which caused weak hands to face and panic sell.  
I agree that you can’t compare it to ordinary stocks or anything that we have ever witnessed in the past, but the run up that we experienced was ridiculous imo and it’s finally going through a much needed healthy correction.
Again, i really hope I’m wrong haha cause I bought in a little higher than I should have and didn’t expect this kind of dip.

Didn’t realize there was a formula for figuring out bitcoin’s valuation. Do tell me if there is cause I’d love to be able to predict the market. 
I’m just going by the fact that you know... most people I know that are or have been invested in it have no idea what it even is.. I believe the growth is going to come with mass adoption and providing a financial opportunity for those people who are denied access to banking systems. I just don’t think we are quite there yet because it’s at such early stages.
