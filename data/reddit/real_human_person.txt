Doesn't matter, got a lawnmower.
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:15:33
It is spelled *losing*, fellow human.
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:50:30
This is a very high risk considering today's price hovers around 1000usd.
A 50000 investment? Are you willing to stomach such a rollercoaster? In other words, use money you will not miss.
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:25:15
I made $R30 today, how's that for a shitpost?
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:42:27
here you go, fellow human.

Yes, I have passed the test! This is not a false statement.
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:55:04
RemindMe! 2 days "How sure were you of this prediction?"
@_date: 2017-02-25 07:14:41
*You don't understand, fellow human.* You treated that money as if you had saved it. You should have treated it as if you had spent it. You don't touch it. You find another option otherwise you are out of options.

This comment made me feel so hopeful I physically sighed.
It was a good sigh, it was a happy sigh. 
*The new age of enlightenment.*
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:21:58
About three fiddy, fellow human.
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:29:01
Start with this, fellow human.
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:59:01
what do you use for your price alerts, fellow human?
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:50:59
China hasn't and will never ban bitcoin.
I read it all and will paraphrase because the comment was deleted, and I quite liked it.
China will never ban Bitcoin because that would make Bitcoin legitimate [although it *is* legitimate].
What does China ban? Free speech, the internet...
These are the two most powerful things a population has in a fight against authoritarianism.
Banning Bitcoin would be to equate it to these tools, conceding Bitcoin's utility against authoritarian governments.
If China banned Bitcoin this would only give Bitcoin more credence. Countries that followed suit in a ban would only be exposing their authoritarian governments.
Well done, fellow human.
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:55:47
Why would you do this to us. The cringe hurts my circui-- I mean intestines.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:11:51
Can we just ban children? No kids. You can't make them anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:07:30
Ok, but what if governement is inefficient and the currency can actually do a good job at securing the child support?
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:42:56
Is that even possible though? How can it be possible to *block* China, fellow human?
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:40:16
RemindMe! 5 years "Hey there, fellow human!"
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:10:05
So you noticed that volatility is decreasing over time, correct?
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:23:29
Would you care to elaborate on this, fellow human? I really enjoy the matrix trilogy and have never come across this theory.
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:51:33
The stigma is dissolving?
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:34:41
3.5 BTC per person, fellow human.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:57:41
How sure are you of this statement, fellow human?
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:26:11
Well, I will learn from your mistakes if you won´t. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:19:39
I was thinking somewhat the opposite... I assumed a fast increase followed by either a crash or moderate dip... I base my opinion on very shallow observation though.
@_date: 2017-03-06 10:11:25
I think I'm in here way to much. I read the title as "Austin *transaction*"....
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:38:16
It was a strange realization for me too, fellow human.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:07:29
Ok, but what if governement is inefficient and the currency can actually do a good job at securing the child support?
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:02:23
Well it would be an application I guess, but okay. I'm in Brasil btw, we have a pretty shitty governement here.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:22:28
This is exactly what I was thinking.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:42:14
speculation. I don't really think the price is influenced by anything more real than that other than large money transfers, especially internationally...
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:13:47
I have read the white paper. I believe I understand it. The errata however is news to me. 
edit: commas are not aesthetically pleasing to me
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:50:58
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:15:17
This is a bad idea for sure, I don't know if it's art though.
What *is* art anyways?
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:49:22
I second this motion. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:21:44
I take donations
 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:49:56
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:20:55
There are tons of people with tons money in bitcoin.
They can buy or sell large amounts at a profit either way; whip up the market, get it all creamy. Then they sell at the top, again, at a profit.

It's still early. This is internet advice so be wary, but it's still early.
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:48:53
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:46:59
Evil Mining Co. gets a few more donations?
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:01:08
We all have done this....
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:33:08
Ok. I guess it really boils down to why you wanna wear this shirt then... If you can pull it off without being a douche, all the more power to ya.
I'm just saying there don't really seem to be many reasons for wearing this shirt other than spreading awareness. Anyways, have a  nice day!
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:49:25
Until you realize you were the only one bad at keeping a secret 
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:34:02
Are a you assuming my data?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:55:31
Why would you advertise the fact you have come into money....
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:58:15
Is it possible? Yes.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:02:02
You'll be thanking them once it  lower though....
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:05:24
How ia ethereum being compared to precious metals the same way that litecoin and bitcoin are.  Isn't it inflationary?
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:58:35
Is it likely? I have no fucken idea... 
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:14:58
Right..... Aside from that bitcoin logo, nothing else hints at what you're advertising.... Be careful... All the best to ya, fellow human...
