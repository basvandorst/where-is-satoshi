or attacker, gave new keys gave to bitgo as new 2-3 internal bitfinex address. signed tx with bfx key, and "new key" that was just given. hence bypassing bitgo's security checks.

huge possibility it was this
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:51:59
1 key with bitgo, 1 or  2 with bitfinex (some instances 3rd is with client).
but imagine bitgo receiving automatd request from compromised bitfinex system to generate new address from compromised bitfinex key and a new key they're sending (actually belongs and generated by hacker). so now intruder now has 2 keys, one he just sent to bitgo, one he obtained from compromising bitfinex. hacker sends a tx to  bitgo to sending stored coins  to new "internal" address, which bitgo system might not see as a problem and signs (cause internal). hacker now has a way to bypass bitgo's security system, by broadcasting a transaction spending from the newly minted 2-3 address himself.

System Archt Here:
Currently we don't require the currency code for a request. A request must match a pattern we set for them the request to get processed. Filipinos are are already used to a system like this, being the "sms capital" of the world.
As for confirmations, as a poster already mentioned. We are doing 0-confirms and are only limited by the speed telco networks are able to send messages. Usually though its pretty quick.

@_date: 2014-06-30 10:31:49
that is actually in the drawing board. but right now we chose to do it this way first, as the lower rates we offer can be a motivator for migrant workers to learn and inquire about bitcoin

Gavin already addressed  the second claim  on this paper, when the paper  about selfish mining came about.
A bit of a concern though is when an actors best interest is to create mistrust in the block chain.

Funny though no one has forked it yet after a year of no updates and nothing happening. Its pretty easy to call out a guy crying/bitching cause he wants to get paid more for the work he does, than doing the actual work yourself.

yes ideally and theoretically, the economic majority will determine the direction of bitcoin. but right now there is no denying that the core devs actually hold huge way compared to BF

this! 
letting mining contract owners decide which pool to use would mitigate circumstances like this. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 00:20:21
yes, and exactly why it's moot, imho. the bitcoin foundation as it is currently organized is controlled by industry giants, the economic majority in the bitcoin space. this is in line with how bitcoin as a protocol is setup. as ultimately it is the economic majority, those who put the most value into bitcoin, who will determine the course bitcoin takes.
even if someone comes up with a solution or an organization that allows 1:1 voting for each member, it will be useless. as whatever decisions this new scheme/org comes up with (i.e. changes to the protocol, changes to core implementation) if it is to the detriment of the economic majority's interest, it wont prosper and will die out.

@_date: 2014-05-17 18:16:04
the direction of bitcoin will always be determined by the economic majority. when an new organization gets the support of bitpay coinbase, other large exchanges and majority of miners. then that's the time things will change. such is the sad reality. more value you put into bitcoin, the higher sway you get to its direction.
in short he who has the gold makes the rule.

skyhook needs to improve their system architecture before trying to ship 1000 units imho. 
right now the speed of the current camera makes it cumbersome when trying to capture your QR.
the packaged 4gb sd card, also fills up quite fast. which when that happens, will make you need to clone the sdcard and  ssh into the raspbian running the php/mysql server to resize and restart it.
the android device and the browser also needs a few more restrictions if ever you plan on deploying it on location.
right now as it stands, the ATM still stands for: Assisted Teller Machine.

no please?
- use utxo / unspent transaction as a vote wieghted according to value of bitcoins contained in transation
- median of votes will be new blocksize
- utxo without vote is considered a nay vote
- to accomodate for and negate current "lost" coins, age based weighting using block height will also be used.

jdillons proposal is actually a pretty good idea, he should prolly submit it as a bip
shouldnt call it proof-of-stake though, makes it sound like an altcoin proposal to others. bitcoin-holder voting or money in mouth voting comes to mind as a better alternative.

digital ocean's a bit pricey. if you have the dough, adding an $80 server from them would be ideal as you can use their private network to link up your 2 servers.
But being the case that your budget is constrained, you can perhaps use a cheaper provider to host a node there independent of you current prod server.
like this:
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:09:20
^ rather ruin train company by congesting train station and filling trains up over capacity with people who all have discounted tickets.

agreed. China has been clamoring for an alternative global currency for years. they've been asking for IMF SDR to be converted into such, but there has been strong opposition form Germany and the US. Bitcoin when it will be widely accepted will provide an even better alternative given how it can show the real weigth of world's currency  compared to  how SDR's valuation is derived from the currency of just 4 countries.

well there's an idea!!! how bout an exchange for gold to xbt
@_date: 2013-10-18 07:00:24
I dont mean consensus as such that there is synchronization, but rather each node checking if it is a valid block. 
Because the block hash requires a valid block time stamp. I dont think mined blocks when disconnected would get accepted.

@_date: 2013-10-18 09:22:48
yes definitely, but right now though after the discussion above, it seems bitcoin isn't yet prepared for this eventualities. Or rather has no protocol in place for when something such as this happens.
@_date: 2013-10-13 18:42:35
A couple of court cases in the past have ordered defendants to produce decryption keys, if law enforcement officers already seen or know of the contents of the encrypted media.  
But then again, Ross Ulbricht has no motivation to. And the only thing the court can resort to with non compliance is jail time.
@_date: 2013-10-18 06:11:06
From what i understand, this isnt even possible. Given that part of the block hash, the proof of work, is a timestamp and a hash based on all of the transactions in the block. 
Theoretically after an "internet" shutdown. Being that a consensus is required for a block to be accepted, when everything comes back online those pre created block wont get accepted. Meaning most likely, bitcoin will continue from how it was before the shutdown. Although  creating transactions during a worldwide "shutdown" would be another matter. 
But if you think about ti, if the whole internet shutdown, your bitcoins would be the least of your concerns as this means some cataclysmic event  has occurred and brought down a system designed to withstand even nuclear war.
@_date: 2013-10-15 03:06:31

lol... or refuses to see the point entirely because of vested interest
@_date: 2013-10-18 07:44:36
Reviewing the protocol rules has actually cleared it up. Yes you are right. Those blocks would get accepted if you have the longest chain when the "internet" is back up. 
This got me thinking though, because a race condition is created. A prolonged disconnection of a large networks could create a problem. (i.e. if a war ever occured between china and us, those countries could theoretically cut connection to both countries) Seems like a person could theoretically "double spend" while the networks are apart.
