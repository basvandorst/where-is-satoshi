You people belong to USA (i think), So you people are aware of bitcoin. But i recently (5 September) got info about bitcoins and bought 2 BTC @ 4500$ and still holding and will hold for long. I can hold alot of btc if i heard back about Bitcoins because i invested in property.
Btw which countries bank offers 1% interest? Seems your bank is taking huge profit from your hard earned money and giving nothing.
I am from India and here only 1 bank offers 6% interest and all other banks offers 4% interest and largest bank of India (State bank of india) recently reduced from 4% to 3.5% interest (because of Demonitization &amp; GST).

Segwit transaction size is around 130 bytes.. and Non-Segwit is around 230 bytes.. So check mempool How much satoshi per byte is required to get in Next block or Second block or above.
Example: if you pay 8 sat/byte fee then 1 txn will cost you 130*8 = 1040 satoshi per transaction.

Yes. Its was the best option for me.. But 1 months back they stopped USD wire transfer. While they are using CAD, JPY, Sepa.. So Sepa is for europe only and not for India. While CAD, JPY are for domestic users only.
Any other exchange in your mind?
@_date: 2018-04-07 08:12:25
Again around will face 6% loss their due to cross currency markup !!
