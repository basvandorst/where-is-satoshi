Sound, so where would I go then. I want the trades to be anonymous... No handing details to mtgox

This is quite worrying... Conclusion seems tight.
But it wouldn't make sense for the owner of all those coins to drop them at once. More likely, stay rich for ever by dropping enough to get what you want, while not destroying the market.
It's probably a subset of the initial programmers (Gavin etc.) anyway and i believe they would like to see the protocol last forever.
So, in the mean time, I welcome our new bitcoin overlords.
Here's something you can drop a little on already while still staying comfortably distanced from the proletari.
Shit, just noticed this website is gone, another scam.... :-)
Address has taken over 750 bitcoins....

I think this is class... Theres already services that do this with your details (companies that hide your details). Even big registrars offer it as a service...
Fuck half the sites I vist on the net are registered fraudulently.... I wouldn't be worried as long as you have a back up of your data. Whats a name?

Amazing Video... Great tool... shows how much time and work these guys put in...

Ive been thinking about this for a while too... making an ad...
I kind of now what your going for but the feeling people get from music differs emotionally... while imagining the ad I was thinking of making I was actually going to use silence... images of nature expanded with questions posed over it in a good overvoice. Because the ideas bitcoin gives me is this idea of freedom... I detest ads but admire the art. In reality though i suppose the idea I have is personal, if people dont understand the concept its more than confusing.
Maybe try some lemon jelly kind of sounds, simple build ups to some nice crescendos with a jazz/electronic kind of feel. All very placid...

I was saying this same thing to a friend... better people to have 8m...

I was thinking maybe 2.00 or 1.50. But Im just guessing, have you any reason why you believe this?

The reason I thought Bitcoin instead of gold silver is it's still usable as a currency to some degree, where as gold/silver are kind of useless. Although the rises are great, even if it was stable it might mean a more safe investment than having euros. I stopped using banks for most of my money in the last year but still keep a lot of it in the credit union. I'm just worried that one day I might wake up and be told there's a freeze on all money in the country (I've read recently that this situation may occur in Greece rather soon if they drop out of the euro). Are these fears justified? At least having some disposable bitcoin, I could get them transferred to a trusted party abroad at a moments notice. (Paranoid I know but just trying to balance the risk). Living here, knowing what our government has committed to monetarily and the hyperbole that is constantly spewed at us, it just doesn't add up. We will never be able to pay back our loans. And most of the people I know are un-employed carpenters and tradesmen with no chance of re-education or work. If any do get jobs they do so under the counter.

thanks, ill look into this. didnt know where to start with gold
@_date: 2011-09-11 15:25:59
Another bounce to 12 from 6... is this a bot gone wrong? Anyone any ideas?
It's a shame, could have made some money today with all these shenanigans...

It's just that coming from an IT backround, I can see the use for bitcoin and how to use them. Bonds and blue chips etc. is all foreign to me. I've never invested before in my life and I am only seeking to do so now to have some means of saving my current (limited) cash assets.

Yea, something along these lines might suit. Initially I was interested in all the mining and speculation talk but when it comes down to using it for transactions, I believe I would be best ignore a lot of it. Depending on my trust of the currency I can always exchange as much as I determine necessary. Little bit from column A and a little bit from column B
@_date: 2011-04-30 10:57:36
Im with you. I wanted to start using this, Im not so keen on the massive jumps. It makes it an unusable idea for its intended purpose.
@_date: 2011-07-20 15:54:10
thanks, this will help. Ill transfer the bitcoins to them and then withdraw...
Sorry mtgox, I was taking money out to pay my car insurance. Real world doesn't wait. (or accept bitcoins yet)
@_date: 2011-07-19 17:26:29
Been trying to take money out for the last week or so. They rejected it saying they needed the country (even though I had an IBAN code).
This is bollocks.... I stayed with mtgox even after the crash. Now I can't get my money out... You idiots.
@_date: 2011-04-06 08:24:56
I thought the rate of creation is kind of fixed in time due to the algorithm. Most of the jumps seem to be from more speculative gambling on the currency. I think a big early adopter would be great aright though.
