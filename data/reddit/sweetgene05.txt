Have you watched any of the bowl games so far?
The crowds have all been sparse because most are celebrating xmas with friends/family and are watching on TV.  
The bowl game in Honolulu looked like it had a few hundred people in the stands by comparison.
Also, keep in mind that most CFB fans will scan through the scores/highlights of every bowl game, including this one.
ESPN will do highlights and replays
The Bitcoin Bowl was a big success IMO

"science is often wrong"
I'm pleasantly surprised that you aren't going to fight me on that, well done!  
Repeat that to yourself everyday to help bring it home.
You then go on to name call and build out a few straw men you can knock down.....shows weakness
To help you out, I will clarify my position once again.
I agree the climate is in a constant state of change.
I disagree man is the leading cause of this change.  
Do you see the difference?
People are on both sides of the debate.   As much as you think you know the truth, you do not, and neither do I, which is why I don't push an agenda.   I simply disagree with your premise.
You could say the same thing about God.....some leading scientist are Atheist, while others are devout Christians.
Stephen Hawking versus Issac Newton.......using your style of prose, who is "retarded" in this case?
Q.  What doom and gloom prediction were made if the USA did not sign the Kyoto treaty back in the 1990's?   How many of those came to pass?
Q.   Same with the gloom and doom prediction made by Al Gore.   How many came to pass?
Q.  Why did the tag change from global warming to climate change?   
.....and seriously, stop with the name calling.  It is not helpful.  
Do you really have an open mind....?
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:01:41

@_date: 2015-03-24 03:31:08
oh my goodness 
you really think this big story broke world-wide, and it was all made up...nothing to see here folks....really?
I suppose we will have to agree to disagree - believe what you want.
Those of us keeping abreast of the climate literature have known for quite some time that the explanation for Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) relating to climate change, was far from the entire story, with almost all dissenting opinion having been actively suppressed. But the full extent of the problem was not made clear until November 19, 2009, when approximately 160 megabytes of data files and email correspondence was leaked from Britain's government-funded University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU).
An initial review of this material revealed four damning facts:
Current global temperature data was being actively manipulated in order to conceal real-world temperature declines that did not support the computerized climate models that were being used to predict runaway global warming. Additionally, historical data showing that during the Medieval Warm Period (900-1300 AD), the earth had been warmer than what was seen today, thereby shattering any causal connection between man made CO2 and temperature rise.
For quite some time, as is a normal part of any scientific peer-review process, independent scientists and organizations had been requesting the release of the raw temperature data used by the CRU in determining its results. Nevertheless, the CRU had continually refused to make their data available. (And now we understand why!) Additional requests for the data were made under the UK's Freedom of Information laws, and the scientists at the CRU are seen discussing how to circumvent these laws, including destroying correspondence and the temperature data itself, rather than allow it to be seen by others.
A review of the source code for the computerized models used to predict the significant global temperature gains being reported, showed that much of it was completely unintelligible to the programmers charged with maintain it, and in some cases, these programs could not be made to reproduce similar results previously obtained by others using the same code base and data sets. This code was in a constant state of manipulation in order to produce predetermined results.
The correspondence shows a small group of scientists frequently discussing ways to subvert the normal scientific peer-review process. This included having climate papers only be "reviewed" by one another, or by people already fully committed to the belief in AGW, stopping publication of any papers that were skeptical of AGW, and working to remove editors from scientific journals that were willing to publish any dissenting opinions.
Soon after the release of the CRU files, this event came to be known as Climategate. However, none of this came as a real shock to a group of skeptical scientists who had been questioning the AGW results for some time, but had been effectively barred from publishing their analyses in standard scientific journals and media outlets. In this way, the general public had been manipulated through the presentation of an unchallenged propagandist viewpoint, into supporting drastic government interventionist policies in order to stave off the supposed pending crisis to all of humanity.

I can reference countless sources.
If you want to attack the author, then let's just go with the "Climate-Gate" scandal and the falsification of data by the supporters of climate change.
What is your rebuttal to this?
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:17:21
yikes, the passive aggressiveness is dripping off your comment...might want to do something about that
"meta-study".....&lt;rolling eyes&gt;
"it is very clear".....to you I suppose
then right after that you go on to say
"there are studies that show no correlation"....yes, I know.
Q.   What is the difference between scientific theory and scientific fact?
I'll help you out....
Science uses specialized terms that have different meanings than everyday usage. These definitions correspond to the way scientists typically use these terms in the context of their work. Note, especially, that the meaning of “theory” in science is different than the meaning of “theory” in everyday conversation.
Fact: In science, an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as “true.” Truth in science, however, is never final and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded tomorrow.
Hypothesis: A tentative statement about the natural world leading to deductions that can be tested. If the deductions are verified, the hypothesis is provisionally corroborated. If the deductions are incorrect, the original hypothesis is proved false and must be abandoned or modified. Hypotheses can be used to build more complex inferences and explanations.
Law: A descriptive generalization about how some aspect of the natural world behaves under stated circumstances.
Theory: In science, a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses.
now tell me again how the issue is settled?

yep...you got me
government agencies and climate scientist circle the wagons and say everything is good....nothing to see, back to man made climate change people
cmon sheep - we need more taxes, more regulation and less freedom to save humanity from itself!!!
I actually agree we are seeing climate change.  My point is that irrefutable evidence that these changes are man made is just not there.
Remember Al Gore and his wild claims about parts of California collapsing into the ocean by now.  When the media and governments get behind something as strongly as they have with man made climate change.......well, believe what you want.

....just try to keep an open mind.
If I see irrefutable evidence that humans are the primary variable in climate change, then I am open to changing my position.
Are you open to changing yours....?

nice rebuttal to the definition of scientific theory
and with some name-calling....very strong.  :)
I suspect you are one that whatever you believe in is correct without question.  I mean how could it not be, it is what you believe?
If the issue was settled, man-made climate change would not be a hot topic and all those laws/regulations would be in place and embraced by the citizens of the world.
Was the issue settled back when the USA refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol?   Or was everyone still "retarded" back then as you call me in another post.  Hmmm, or maybe you weren't active in the "cause" yet to set everyone straight?
I'm apologize in advance for posting any links.  I can see how you dislike that.   
Pro-Tip:   Google is your friend 
I'll say it again.....the issue is not settled
climate change &lt;&gt; man-made climate change
sorry bro
The Kyoto Protocol will still run until 2020, an extension targeting 18% carbon cuts on 1990 levels.
It’s not a target that will tax those who sign up (although many haven’t so far), and the main value will be to keep reporting and accounting practices, along with the CDM, ticking over until a Paris deal comes into effect.
Its biggest legacy – one it shares with the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit – is likely to be its abject failure to address the causes of climate change.
Any deal struck in the French capital later this year may not resemble Kyoto, but the way it is constructed will be, in no small part, a result of lessons learnt by policymakers since 2005.
Chief among those is that while the world’s superpowers will not accept legally binding carbon caps, they can be convinced of the need to implement greener policies and the long-term benefits these will offer their own countries.
“We cannot link all these emissions reductions directly to the Kyoto Protocol, but it clearly played an important role in catalyzing this promising trend which has led to a collective and very welcome ‘over-achievement’,” says Figueres.

this has not been proven
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:18:16
we will have to agree to disagree
fact remains, man made climate change has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt
climate changing, even dramatically does not prove that it is caused by man
scientific theories are just that....theories
always remember it was "another ice age" back in the 70's
then when the facts didn't bear that out, the switch to "global warming"
nope....that doesn't jive, so let's go with the ambiguous "climate change"
who could disagree with "climate change" right?  
now all we need is to work in the man-made angle and we have a winner!
unfortunately, you'll probably get your wish one day
carbon credits for individuals and a big exchange to manage it all (see Al Gore)
thermostats controlled by government to control energy consumption
plenty of extra taxes to fund all the groups and agencies to enforce
loopholes for corporations
while we are at it, probably should put some laws in place to control population and control all that man made climate change right?
smells like freedom and sounds awesome!
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:17:56
Of course humanity needs to move forward and work towards a better future.  Do you know of anyone that disagrees with that statement?  I sure don't.
That being said, this is a much different topic than "man made climate change" and the taxes and regulations that will follow.

your own comment hints at doubt
I'm not dismissing anything - I agree climate is changing.
I disagree with humans being the primary factor.
Disagreement is not ignorance, it is disagreement.

@_date: 2015-03-24 12:41:46
ok, we are starting to go around in circles a bit
let's do this
show me irrefutable facts that human activity correlates with climate changes on planet Earth
keep in mind causation &lt;&gt; correlation
you have climate data points 
we have human activity that is causing some amount of impact on the climate....what is the % you think impacts the climate?
now whatever % you think that is....prove to me with data that this activity correlates with Earth climate changes beyond a reasonable doubt
short answer - you can't
long answer - you have a few theories, but have difficulty explaining away the other variables (sun activity, natural weather patterns, etc).
ok, now back to your claim I am ignorant
enlighten me with your statistical analysis that proves the correlation - I took statistics years ago in my Masters degree, so yes, I will be able to follow you.
fyi.....not believing man made climate change as the primary variable behind climate changes SHOULD be the de facto position of a logical mind....it is far from "believing in unicorns"?
the world is not black and white - nothing is 100% certain including your analysis.....for example, have you looked into the variations in data recording from the multiple global weather stations?  
Temp record is unreliable
"We found [U.S. weather] stations located next to the exhaust fans of air conditioning units, surrounded by asphalt parking lots and roads, on blistering-hot rooftops, and near sidewalks and buildings that absorb and radiate heat. We found 68 stations located at wastewater treatment plants, where the process of waste digestion causes temperatures to be higher than in surrounding areas."
In fact, we found that 89 percent of the stations – nearly 9 of every 10 – fail to meet the National Weather Service’s own siting requirements that stations must be 30 meters (about 100 feet) or more away from an artificial heating or radiating/reflecting heat source." (Watts 2009)
even if the IPPC scandal did not happen.....the issue is not settled
Yes - this it is a hot button topic - calling names, claiming the other side is ignorant (far from it) or throwing out standard climate data points and claiming "man" is the problem behind it.....just doesn't fly with me.   
Do you not find it interesting Al Gore had his carbon credit exchange all ready to go?
Do you not find it interesting that the USA and other governments already have the laws/regulations/taxes on deck and ready to roll in?
I remember this type of name-calling a few years back, when discussing my anti-war stance and the US going into the Middle East.   I was an idiot back then as well.  I mean, you saw all the reports and the organizations and the respected authority figures all come out and show us the evidence........see a pattern?
