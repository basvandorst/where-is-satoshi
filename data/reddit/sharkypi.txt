Doesn't feel like a big issue... and arguably it exposes a potential (light) security weakness whereby one can access the app from the background without needing to re enter the passcode... so if I just had the app open, then left my phone on the table, looked away, someone stole it, they could check the recent app stack and transfer all coins in the wallet, if present. Unlikely but terrible if it happens.

Cheers for taking the time and (ostensibly) taking this seriously. A straw poll of responses on this page shows that some people (, myself, possibly others) are willing to give you guys the benefit of the doubt, for a while.
So: how long will this take? It seems to me that if you're looking to monetise our info as a business model then changing this will impact your business plan and be a huge decision. If this is, as you suggest, poorly worded and possibly hastily drafted, then fixing the wording - especially for a privacy expert as you seem to be - shouldn't be too troublesome.
Figuring out how to roll out the policy changes should be easy enough no? Make the changes, PM / bulk reply to the people on this page linking to the amended sections, slap a notice on the changetip frontpage, etc..

what if the bubbles get bigger and wider as the community and total wealth gets bigger and dissipates volatility?

and every bad actor's removal leads to the ecosystem addressing the problem that led to their presence in the first place.
If the guy in Catch Me If You Can tried his early scams in his latter days he'd get caught immediately &amp; it'd be game over, because the arms race of exploit/fix leads to increasingly difficult exploits that only a few rich/genius can manage. This holds for confidence scams too - already we're seeing companies touting their reserves through open audits, keen to advertise they're not confidence scamsters.
This all strikes me a little like the wild west / gold rush times. The start is risky and those who went all in either got rich and got out, or got dead. Infrastructure built up around it and it stabilised and it calmed down in a flash because of the weight of people working to make an efficient system.

they can, they will, they do. but as the total value of money put in to buy bitcoins goes up, and the total number of bitcoins stays flat, the value per bitcoin goes up. Which is just fine. The classic story is the guy who bought 2 pizzas for a bitcoin value that would not be equivalent to some $10,000.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:36:11
I think you've touched on an important point to remember here: we're talking about tiny amounts of money. Yes, yes, the principle etc etc., but the people liable to be in this situation are going to be those who logged in, saw it, then never did anything and forgot about it. And if it transpires that a year later they remember that they might have a dollar in an account somewhere, is it really that big of a deal?

Hey man, hope you're well. Coming back to this, as I still have my coins in an exchange and am still not sure what's the best thing to do.




Will the labels feature in the app fully address the current (potential) browser insecurity, i.e.: when labels are implemented, can I start a new separate fund in the wallet and therefore no longer be at risk of the browser insecurities which I was exposed to when I set up the account?
If not, please can you let me know what you advise? Should I start a completely new account, register within the app, set up new security protocols for that account/wallet, then login to the old account, send money to the new account, then close and delete the old account?
Thanks very much for your help. Obviously I'd like to do the least and easiest thing possible, but not if that's not the safest thing to do!

Strange one I've just found: if you log in on the app, then click the link in gmail and open that in the app, you're prompted to log in again, which seems normal, but then it says i'm already logged in &amp; do I want to logout... which makes it seem like there's multiple instances of the app running. Is this a bug or am I misunderstanding?

i read an interesting thing a fair while back which posited that if the world esp China were to genuinely embrace something e.g. bitcoin, there'd be no need for countries to be required to stockpile massive quantities of USD in their reserves, which is the world's 'base currency' (*sketchy memory, by all means other people jump in if you know/remember more).
This would apparently devastate the global value of USD and potentially murder the US economy.

factoring into this, we're only on bitATM version 1, if you catch my drift. People are complaining about them, but surely they'll improve. Everyone seems to be focusing on how annoying it is to go to an ATM and turn cash into bitcoin; as a regular traveller I love the idea of being able to easily turn my bitcoin into cash without fees and bank transfers and such. And its presence in the downstream country makes it more likely that local vendors will accept directly anyway.

@_date: 2014-04-02 19:16:05
i think there's also the lag effect. it's a pain in the arse getting into bitcoin, I almost don't care if people tell me to the contrary (I know that makes me sound like a prick!), and subsequently I expect I'm not alone in taking my time to fully research it, and then going through the process of getting involved, slowly. If you're already in bitcoin, it's easy to add, say, 100 USD value in bought bitcoins. If you're not, it's phenomenally more difficult. But those people slowly trickle through. I suspect that the drip drip drip of news e.g. bitcoin ATMs etc, will mean there are a lot of people in the shadows, watching to see how far the price drops before getting in for the first time.

another thought: on the app, it would be useful if the default behaviour, after filling out the login code and hitting 'next' on the phone's keyboard, would be to either highlight or even hit the main OK button, rather than go to the next thing, which is the mnemonic passphrase, which is an 'OR' not a required AND.

International travel to the USA, moving from good to bad banking systems. The ability to avoid paying to convert a chunk of currency is appealing, and the notion of an international currency even more so.

@_date: 2014-04-08 00:46:19
i don't know if other people would like this, but to help people (inc me) get used to BTC valuation, i'd like to see the bot interpret the amount and print a line of all btc valuations AS WELL AS common currencies e.g.
"Here , have 1 mBTC on me!"
Sharky-PI has tipped 0.001 BTC / 1mBTC / 1000 uBTC. @ 01:44 GMT 08/04/2014 = 0.0245 USD / 0.0823 EUR / GBP / AUS / BLA / BLA / BLA / etc.
Though maybe it would be annoying. What if it only came when called?
"BTC converted how much?"
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:20:49
I'm with you, there's an important hole in the shape of a simple website which shows all the decimal variations &amp; names &amp; symbols for BTC, lined up with satoshis and one, two, three or more currencies of the users' choice.
Then after that, a reddit which, when called, would spit that info back at you relative to the parent comment e.g. "BTCcalc how much?"
And it spits out a little table.
Did that gaittip work?
@_date: 2014-05-07 23:53:22

Hey dude, just coming back to this, preparing to create a new wallet in app &amp; transfer my coins over. Just thought: will the desktop java version eliminate the current safety concerns?
It would be great to be able to manage my account on PC rather than app - not that the app is bad, it's good and will hopefully be great for on the go transactions, but doing account administration etc is a pain, and lastpass integration into mobile isn't as good as desktop, and ther last thing I want is to not be able to access my account.
Cheers. Final thing: am I right in thinking that with greenaddress, one acount = one wallet? I can't create a new wallet with my current details? And would that negate the point of statring a new wallet in any case, i.e. creating new login info?
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:45:37
Thanks. Ok, so as much for my own future reference as anything else, that would thus be:
1. Buy trezor, set it up which generates your private address (functionally analagous to your bank account number, ish)
2. Set up an account with e.g. kraken or itbit, get verified, transfer currency to them, they convert to btc, you give them a public address, which means the btc gets magically sent to your private address without anyone seeing it. You now have money in your account.
3. Trezor is the only way to access the btc associated with your private address. You can transfer money to other public addresses (e.g. friends or businesses) from Trezor when plugged into a computer.
4.  A: For big cash movements, use Trezor on your safe computer to transfer the money directly.
5. For small cash movements e.g. paying friends or buying things, use Trezor on your safe computer to transfer a chunk of 'walking around' money to e.g. blockchain.info wallet, then pay directly from that. Trezor won't be involved in these transactions.
Thanks again for the help. Sounds like Trezor will be super useful for the main bit that was worrying me: cold storage security for someone who moves around a lot.
EDIT:  From Trezor website: "We will be introducing a light-weighted web wallet for TREZOR owners, that will be easy to use and ultimately secure at the same time"
EDIT again: maybe not. It looks like the web wallet is actually just a transfer interface to move btc from the trezor account to elsewhere (
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:31:21
100% open &amp; honest question from a n00b who's basically just been studying bitcoin for 8 months without yet buying any:
given how much of bitcoin advice, info, and technological development centres around security, and how the most regular thing you hear is how &amp; why one should back up their btc in safe places (which until very recently, possibly still now, have been offline cold storage), how did so many people have so much in there at one time?
Was it that there's just a ton of trade volume being done at any one time and the second they closed, that instantaneous snapshot was lost, or were people keeping their btc in the exchanges coffers in order to trade back &amp; forth, or just for ease?
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:03:46
So would it make sense to use this as one's cold storage wallet for all their Bitcoins, and then use it to transfer small amounts to their own software wallet e.g. on mobile, to use that for spending?
Thanks. Still getting my head around all the concepts!
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:01:38


I kinda see these as two sides of the same (bit!ha!)coin. IMO until shit hit the fan re: global financial meltdown, there were a ton of people, myself very much included, who had little or no idea about what was going on, or even know what fiat meant (other than an Italian car maker). I see adoption being likely because bitcoin is the solution to the problem, before which there seemingly WAS no solution. A huge part of bitcoin's story is exactly that it's inherently trustable in ways that fiat isn't.

Re: bounty: yeah, I'm all for that. Not done bountying before but I'm happy to throw a few currencies into the hat.

@_date: 2014-04-02 16:04:56
So you'd be advocating using this as an all-in-one solution to storing, and using btc? Brilliant if true.
So - apologies for stupid questions, just wanna make sure I'm getting this right - if one were to get into bitcoin using this route, that process &amp; their final setup would look something like:
1. Buy trezor, set it up which generates your private address (functionally analagous to your bank account number, ish)
2. Set up an account with e.g. kraken or itbit, get verified, transfer currency to them, they convert to btc, you give them a public address, which means the btc gets magically sent to your private address without anyone seeing it. You now have money in your account.
3. Trezor is the only way to access the btc associated with your private address. You can transfer money to other public addresses (e.g. friends or businesses) directly from Trezor... without a computer or phone or anything? Or do you still need to connect to a computer to transfer money into a software wallet and then from there directly to others? Or from there (e.g. blockchain android app) to others, authenticating using Trezor?
Thanks for the help. I guess the flipside to the regular gamechanging improvements to bitcoin security is that I have to keep learning afresh!!

this interests me. do you know the conversion charge/rate? One of my key personal interests (outside of libertarian etc etc) is that I live across Ireland, the UK and the US, and would prefer to have one eCurrency which is can spend anywhere.
I suppose one thing about your post is about being charged fees to convert BTC to dollars (and then also to withdraw those dollars, really?! Boo!): my intention is to pay for whatever I can directly on bitcoin. Since that's not realistically possible directly (more possible through gyft etc), I just wouldn't change everything to BTC.
I guess my overall opinion is "when you put it like that, the appeal is slight, but things are changing, and if "the average american" travels much, this is immediately beneficial"

Thanks for the reply; the analogy has me a little confused though: the leather wallet maker in this case would be Kraken, who are really a money exchange service. At the moment I can exchange my euros for dollars but can't take my dollars unless I have an old fashioned leather wallet rather than a new, i dunno, carbon fibre wallet with a funky zip that makes it more secure.
Sounds from others in this thread that to allow me to take it out wouldn't take more work from them, and unless I'm mistaken (re: the exchange vs wallet point of kraken &amp; GAit), I don't see that they're competitors...

Apologies for n00bishness: how would one go about this? Setup a paper wallet, transfer in &amp; out of that?
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:03:26
it's all coming though. And the technologies spread like a virus, and stack, because of the community desire for open source, so if someone comes up with a good security method, everyone else can implement it.
If one can guard against MITM as you say, then I don't think we can be too far away from a simple way to get people using cold storage that they'll understand, and/or increasingly reliable hot wallets. The continued improvements to greenaddress have impressed me, for example.
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:16:49
thanks for all the info, helpful as always!
One quick follow up about the last point: would the introduction of labels mean that there would no longer be a need to create a new wallet?
If so I'll wait for them to come out. If not would I have to set up a completely new account with new username and details etc, then transfer my BTC from old to new?

I'm hoping to use my stupidity for good in the bitcoin community, so:
"if my coins are already in a greenaddress wallet, does this mean it's simply safer to access them via apps than browser? the fact that I set up my wallet through a browser before doesn't impact my security in the future, right?"

Plus an easy &amp; ubiquitous option to finance content is what's been missing, IMO, for ages. The assumption/demand that everything you get through a PC should be free, flies in the face of the obvious amount of time money &amp; effort that content has taken to create, but people seem totally fine to just steal it. Subsequently every player in the affected industries have to try to find new ways of monetising what they used to just be fairly paid for. Mostly: begging, compromising their product to make it primarily an ad distribution service, cutting back expensive services, and going out of business.
A simple &amp; standardised way of regularly micropaying for content could fundamentally shift the balance of online writing, journalist, software developer, musician, etc etc etc careers, and catalyse an explosion of god content in all those fields.

So you could call it "cryptocurrencies" assuming (maybe wrongly) that the others tick all those same boxes, but then you should *still* say "cryptocurrencies e.g. Bitcoin" because there's little point in being technically correct at the expense of being understood.

This replaces a choice of two different words which most people don't inherently understand nor regularly use, with a few words people do.
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:59:23
the flipside is bitcoin discussion so often descends into long bickering threads about technical minutiae, which leads to the need for this, and threads on here are usually ok with being technically correct at the expense of being comprehensible.
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:23:07
so e.g. paper notes which are really not technically the value themselves, but an instruction to transfer that value. Not all of which (not all of ALL the banknotes added together) needs to actually exist in the banks?
Or just the need for physical material itself?
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:45:17
The massive fundamental difference, though, is that people don't have to know anything about how TCP (or, better example, the current banking system) works in order to use it. And in fairness to Bitcoin, I have no doubt that as more &amp; more innovators move into the space, the ability to buy &amp; spend bitcoin will get so easy that everyone can do it, and won't need or want to know why.
The issue, I suppose, is that bitcoin is new and different and so people want to know HOW it's different and WHY it's better. And to explain that, you have to build a phenomenal store of knowledge, and ideally have a Feynman-esque ability to convey that in simple concepts. I'm in EXACTLY the same life situation as (spookily) and I'm half giving up on trying to explain bitcoin to people. I feel that it needs to weather this storm, increase in value, and become more ubiquitous, and then I won't need to explain it to people, because I'll just use it and they'll want it.
Example: we went to Bulgaria on a stag do (bachelor party) this weekend and tried to use [Revolut]( which could have worked out great but it's full of bugs &amp; it was useless. Bitcoin does EVERYTHING it does, cheaper, and better, but local merchants wouldn't accept it. If they did, and I rocked up and bought a round of beers with one-tap NFC then transferred to money to a friend with two clicks, EVERYONE would want in. No question. Similarly, one of the guys on the stag founded Transferwise. Great product, I use it all the time, but again, rendered redundant once bitcoin really takes off.
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:56:49
I wonder....have you seen the "this week in science" posts? [Example]( hosted on their site but it sprang from reddit.
I wonder if there wouldn't be HUGE value in having someone essentially curating news of the progress of bitcoin, especially now. It could almost be an infographic blockchain: start with your first one and every month? Or howeverlong made sense, add another one.
Lots of work though. Cheers for doing this one, it's super helpful.

Very tempted to do the same. Foolishly converted from BTC to BCH on the 11th, ratio was &lt;0.2 when I started trying to convert, was 0.308 2.5 hours later when it finally went through, so conceptually I should have 1.54X more BCH than I currently do. And/or I should feel less bad about buying up a spike as I'd only be half as far up!

I'm a Brit living in a phd-work-cave in Ireland so I only see bits of the US political machine, but the rand paul references seem to be all over the place.

Maybe he's just one of those guys who will literally say anything at any time in order to get votes?
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:44:20
Very good. Bookmarked for use in future conversations. My only criticism is  I think it's rather confusingly written, for one, and since bitcoin's deflationary nature is not yet 'in play' maybe it makes sense not to talk about it unless you're going to make a strong point about why it'll be a great thing? Such points are there to be made.
In  you also bundle in profit potential without explaining how it's related to deflationary currency.
In  you introduce the concept of greater divisibility vs the US dollar but A. don't really explain why this is beneficial and B. don't account for the fact that higher divisibility of the dollar has never been a bit problem and gets increasingly irrelevant as the currency inflates.
Also in  you round out with the infrastructure comment without overtly explaining how it's different from fiat. "If I own $1 surely I own a piece of the US monetary infrastructure though?" would be my thought if I didn't know better.
Like I say, overall 90% success rate, but I feel overhauling that section would improve it. Off top of head suggestion ("bring me solutions not problems approach"):
- There is a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins. These will all be in play by [YEAR]. At that point bitcoin will become a *deflationary* currency. All other currencies are inflationary: more money is printed, so the relative value of one unit goes down. Bitcoin will be the reverse: no more money is printed, so as demand rises, the value of one unit goes UP. This is an enticing prospect: not only does bitcoin serve as a value transfer system (pay people/businesses for stuff) and a store of wealth (bank), over the long term it could be a very reliable source of investment revenue generation (pension/stocks &amp; shares).

IMO they're not models. They're just different styles of presenting the data, some of them with assumptions (bear, bull, flat). They allow you to interpret the underlying data in the context of those assumptions. Which assumptions you choose to believe are the most realistic is up to you. No need to slate the website because you don't understand what data visualisation is for.

@_date: 2013-07-02 23:39:46
but even with that being the case, would you concede that cautious adopters are likely to have greater confidence in an ecosystem where one universally supported cryptocurrency is being considered, rather than array of competing ones, which you admit may supersede bitcoin? That feels like the kind of knowledge which would cause would-be adopters to hold fire and have to do even more research before committing. While they still might do so, it's also possible that this could have been the straw which broke the camel's back, and they said "fuck it, i'll put my money elsewhere".

maybe. but there are more people who will benefit from the new financial world than who'll lose out... it's just that the potential losers are the 1% with 99% of the wealth. And while they're hugely influential, they don't have as much influence over the poor masses in other countries.

are you - like me - somewhat confused as to why a guy who's so strongly convinced that the big nations will kill bitcoin, is subscribed to a sub about bitcoin?

well i'm a noob to bitcoin. but this is my point - i've been into computers for years, am in mensa, doing a phd - i'm defo above the average level of IT understanding, and this has still been a massive pain in the arse. Many on here &amp; elsewhere have done a much better job that I could of explaining bitcoin &amp; its benefits... but if it'll near-inevitably defeat any converts who want to get into it... what's the point? (kinda)

Looking into this further, if I were to be using BIPS (for the eWallet + european bank transfer combo) and it already has an android wallet app, would it be worth using that, to keep everything in one place, or better to use Mycelium instead?
Or is that a flawed understanding of how things work? 
Thanks again!

given how hard it was to shut down the silk road and pirate bay, shutting down the exchanges, in china, will be no easy feat for the US to do, even if it wanted to. Silk &amp; Pirate were flagrantly breaking laws, bitcoin isn't.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:40:38
the advice at the time was that on-PC wallets were more secure. what I was unaware of was that, to work, they have to download the whole blockchain* which takes forever. Boo.
*may well be the wrong term. Needs to know all the transactions until it's knowledge is "live".
And sure, the getting started thing is helpful, but it omits the security stuff you really should have, and it doesn't cover the problems you're going to face when going through the key steps. I've just created an account with the intention of improving it.
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:28:11
well, yeah, i guess, but i'm only reporting to myself :)
i suppose it looks official researchy since there's so much to learn *technically*, but tangentially - as you've confirmed - there's more to it than a simple business decision, like buying Daz instead of the next leading brand.
Were you pretty knowledgeable about all this stuff - banking, reserves, fiat, etc., before doing research for bitcoin? As this seems like a current barrier to adoption (the learning curve before people take the leap), but OTOH also therefore a potental benefit to those who are prepared to do the work and get onboard early...
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:52:29

so if one talks to one's bank and says "i appear to be a cheapskate but am about to add (say) $10k to my account because bitcoin" they'll be like "okey dokey, no flags or huge tax implications for you good lad, off you pop, cheerio"?
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:14:44
multibit is for newbies i.e. it's limited for experts, or it's just so simple it's recommended for all, including newbies?
why downloaded wallet e.g. multibit (potentially easy install &amp; setup but requires lots of technical securing of machine &amp; connection) rather than an online wallet (much of security concerns outsourced but account setup more of an arse)?
p.s. i'm very grateful for the response, but "i don't get what's so difficult" is rather unhelpful. Multibit may well have come along since I first tried and failed with pc-side wallets, but aside from that, you're vastly simplifying the whole process by ending with "Done"... which you allude to by saying how people will look up the security themselves and need experts later on.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:53:33
Just did. Other than vague mention of planning to pay taxes and a tax attorney, and "banks talk to governments", at no point do you opine whether one's likely to experience any problems if they forewarn their bank of an unusual &lt;=$10k deposit.
Btw, while reading your comments in this thread I came upon this, from you:


So you insulted me after I asked a perfectly reasonable, related question in a jovial manner, then sneerily insulted me some more, while being wrong, having responded to THE ISSUE I ASKED YOU ABOUT exactly zero times, and having responded to me just one time, with a sneering insult.

2 quick follow ups:
1. if i lose my hardware wallet have I lost all my bitcoins? (if "no", i'll research the rest later!)

@_date: 2013-07-03 00:22:47
I fully agree. Bitcoin is the leader &amp; thus the prime candidate to set precedents for any others to follow, e.g. payments in stores, direct tap from mobile, etc., but most importantly teaching the world what cryptocurrency IS, and slowly jostling into global worldview &amp; mass acceptance.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:01:43
this process has made me realise the same thing! And the fact that it's necessarily going to get easier to buy in (because people will make money by having the lowest barrier to entry and thus being the one who gets to charge the handling percentages) suggests now is (as it always has been!) the best time to get in. Kinda gutted I gave up in a huff howevermany months ago, when I see the price now!!
@_date: 2013-07-03 00:19:21
i half agree with you &amp; it's heartening to hear you think it's early adopter time, since that's what i'm keen to do!
The half bit is "little economic knowledge required" - technically true, one can follow the extensive how-tos for technically setting up wallets etc if you're computer minded enough, and just get stuck in, start converting cash to bitcoin, but that seems to me like just hurling yourself in the pool without having had any lessons - you might save time and money and instantly realise how to swim, or you might drown. I'd assume most people would wanna assuage their fears of losing money before they spend their first (cent/pound/credit/multipass), which is where the knowledge/understanding... *quagmire* comes in.
