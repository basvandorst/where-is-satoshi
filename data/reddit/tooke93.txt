Is it fat32? If it is, you should try the mini recovery tool as well

Nope, you will only get a few cents if you mine several days on your pc

Any crypto, forget about pc mining. It's just not profitable at all

I try to reopen the wallet several times on the btc chain/segwit. So that was all fine. It’s a problem of the ledgerwallet itself. Thanks a lot for your help!
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:34:29
I Just gave it a try to see if that works. But it seems like there is a problem with the ledger segwit wallet for the moment.. thanks for your help guys!
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:32:07
Great, thanks!!
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:41:05
This was 0,1 btc, so that’s quite a lot, no?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:36:46
Use a segwit wallet... your problem will be solved..
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:35:57
It was just a test to see if it was working. A problem with the segwit legderwallet causes the ‘failed’ transactions. Thanks for your feedback!!

Same story here ��
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:25:35
Nice, that’s how it should be. Learning from your mistakes in the past! Great job!

Which pool and what is the configuration of this miner? Are you sure you use the correct username to connect to the pool?

Slow buy over a few days/weeks or at once it doesn’t matter. The best day to buy is nearly always ‘yesterday’ or the day before...
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:18:19
I don’t think it will drop to that point anymore :(
