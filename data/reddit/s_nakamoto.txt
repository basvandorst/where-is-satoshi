After being unable to withdraw fiat (the equivalent of a high six-digit USD value) for months, I had a Japanese court prepare an order for immediate processing of my withdrawals. I received a bank transfer the next day. The only thing I lost were a few thousand USD-worth in legal fees. No, I don't want any central authority intervening to correct that.

If you plan to heat your home using electricity anyway, it might make sense to use a recent high-efficiency ASIC miner instead of a space heater.

You don't need to "report" payments under $600 as income to the payee on an information return. But you still need to account for capital gain or loss on your own tax return and report it appropriately.

Transactions do not occur unless the number of bitcoins being bought is equal to the number being sold. Every trade has a buyer and a seller.

This is New York State saying "Apply for the license today, and if we accept it then later in the year we will tell you what rules you must abide by."

Using two different names for two different units makes more sense than using one name for two different units. "bitcoin" already means 100,000,000 satoshi. There's no practical way to change it to mean something else.

Sorry, that's not conservative enough. You need to use 5% of the cash amount, plus 10% of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.
(Just to be clear, that was sarcasm)

For every bitcoin sold by one person, that bitcoin is bought by another person. There cannot be more bitcoins sold than bought.

You appear to be assuming that requires a centralized service. It does not.

Neither generalization (that early adopters are out, or that they're hanging on) is uniformly correct. I for one have recently cashed out a significant portion of my holdings from years ago, and yet I continue to hold a large position, run a mining operation, and invest.

The block size limit was added as a spam control measure, not as an economic incentive.  The economic incentives are present even without the block size limit.  A miner pays for building a larger block with an increased chance of having the block orphaned due to additional transmission delays.  The miner trades that off against increased fees received for including additional transactions.  These incentives balance each other to control the block size and transaction fees.

I've claimed capital gains on bitcoins for each of the past three years. The IRS doesn't need to prove anything for you to be required to pay your taxes owed. If you can't account for the money mysteriously appearing in your accounts, or where you got the money for the new Tesla and yacht and real estate, and you don't pay taxes on that apparent income, you may have serious problems later.
On the other hand, if you don't sell or use your bitcoins, you won't realize any income (or loss) so there is nothing to report. HODL!

As long as we're doing thought experiments with arbitrary numbers...
If 200% of the $22T in Chinese deposits moved into btc, then what?
What if 100% of Chinese-owned btc were dumped?
