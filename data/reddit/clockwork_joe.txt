Actually, I was simply selling my assets- you do not need a business account to do such a thing.

I may have paraphrased.

Fuck the downvoters, this is good advice!

No, they will mail a check with the remaining balance.

Convenience. I have 2 bank accounts because I frequently move between 2 locations.

Selling assets does not equal transmitting money. Too lazy to look for a link to the specific definitions, but I do not hold on to anybody's money, transport it, etc. I only make trades. The exchanges, on the other hand, are money services businesses and must register as such.

I love bitcoin, but this is not a sensible option for many reasons- and I see it suggested way too often.
Bitcoin is:
1) too volatile. How am I supposed to put $10,000 of my money into something that turns into $5,000 overnight?
2) not widely accepted. If I have $10,000 in bitcoin, what good does it do if it's only widely accepted on the Black Market (which I would like to keep as much distance as possible from)? We're getting there, but we're still a long way from acceptance at your local grocery store.
3) Expensive or inefficient to convert into USD. 1% from Coinbase? Way too much and takes 4 business days. 0.2% from exchanges? That's good, but then I have to wire money into my account, which takes days (and I need a bank account). Sell on localbitcoins? Instant, but I lose at least 5% and it's unnecessary work.
I'm working on fixing number 3 because nothing like this exists in the USA, so keep your eyes peeled. But until then, it's just not plausible.

Seems like bitcoin-related bank accounts are getting harder and harder to come by.
Is it more money laundering related or fear related? I'd be interested to know.

Coinbase and Bitpay are both excellent choices. I, personally, use Coinbase all the time and can vouch for their legitimacy and customer support.
Coinbase will take a 1% + $0.15 fee from the buyer and a 1% + $0.15 fee from the receiver (in this case, you), thereby totaling 2.5% + $0.30 in fees.
However, Bitpay, to my knowledge, will process bitcoin payments for non-profit organizations free of charge. Keep in mind, though, that they act as a middleman for Bitstamp (a bitcoin exchange) and that their non-profit rate must also include Bitstamp's fees, so you won't necessarily be getting the most bang for your bitcoin (so to speak).
There is another payment processor and exchange coming out in Chicago sometime this year (hopefully September or October) that will give the buyer and receiver/seller the best returns and low fees for multiple cryptocurrencies, as long as you have an American bank account or are based in the United States. This is due to the fact that they will be not be another Bitstamp middleman (i.e. Coinbase or Bitpay), but an exchange in and of themselves. Processing of bitcoin payments is free until you convert to USD, GPB, etc.
Your copyright tells me that your non-profit is based in the United States, so any of these three options is solid, but option  will not be available until later this year.
Best of luck to you and your endeavors and welcome to the world of bitcoin!

Hi, Robin. First things first, good luck moving on with your career! I hope you can remain a part of the bitcoin community.
I only have one question: what bank does Coinbase use? I've been on the hunt trying to find bitcoin-friendly banks and haven't found a single one! I even got a rather sarcastic/rude email from IAFCU (previously bitcoin-friendly Credit Union).
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:59:40
No problem.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:36:47
This is actually probably the most clear response I have gotten yet.
Thank you.

I fear that bitcoin is still viewed rather badly by most people who don't really know anything about it (further than silk road, mt. gox etc.), so that makes sense.
And I suppose it makes bank wires next to obsolete, so there's also that lol
Thanks for the response!

That was the irritating part though. They didn't ask, they just said they're closing my account. It's not like I'm worried about anything, it's just annoying having to shop around at a bunch of banks.
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:23:15
I thought the magic number was $10,000 actually.
And I understand it's a requirement of a credit union or bank, but I feel credit unions wouldn't close my account simply because they don't understand something.
