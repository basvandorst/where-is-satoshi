How adorable.

Everyone? Not really. Just a very *very* small number of people. Most people don't even know about cryptocurrency at all.

No, it's stupid. I'll just make a billion of my own coin. Sell 1 of those coins to my friend for $1. Now, the "market cap" of my coin is 1 billion because the last (and only) traded price for that coin was $1.
A better metric is to look at volume traded over time.

Yeah if we only were getting raises. Unless you are the CEO, you need a "reason" for why you deserve a raise today. And no, "because the purchasing power of my dollar went down, and my rent doubled" is not adequate apparently.

No, there aren't more robust cryptos. 
Pretty much the majority of the focus of Bitcoin's development is spent making sure it maintains decentralization and adheres to strong security. Most altcoins are experimental and sacrifice one of those attributes - hardly "robust" at all.

Are you kidding me? This is their new "toy". Everyone wants an asset class uncorrelated to traditional markets, and crypto is exactly that. They will probably blow this up to a bubble just like they have with everything else. That doesn't mean they won't try to create a bunch of FUD or tank the market first though.

Yes. That's basically what I wanted to illustrate.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:59:40
Yeah dude, trying. It's just hard.

Even ignoring inflation, prices are rising on everything in my area. It sucks.
