Exactly. I really hope OP spoke with a tax accountant and estate attorney (who specializes in charitable trusts/foundation's) before putting any of this through.
Avoiding a ton of tax on all of that gain is the tip of the iceberg.
I'll copy and paste something I wrote elsewhere recently:
"The very wealthy can get more benefit from their charitable aspirations though. My favorite strategy is this:
* Place highly appreciated assets into an Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT). Maybe you own $10m of Bitcoin and you originally paid $25,000.
* You receive a huge tax deduction that can be carried forward. You also avoid paying tax on all the gain those appreciated assets had.
* You receive income from the trust as long as you are alive. This can be setup in a few different ways, but is often 5% of the value of the trust.
* At your death, the remaining assets are given to a charity that you had chosen.
* Funny thing is, you designate a foundation. A foundation that is formed at your death.
* This foundation's purpose is to monetarily support a cause (e.g. a foundation that awards a scholarship annually for low-income students interested in programming).
* Your offspring manage this foundation, drawing salaries (finance, accounting, attorney work etc.). Foundation's are generally required to output 5% of their assets annually to support their cause. These salaries eat into that 5%.
That's a whole lot of benefit. It's kind of fucked up how many crazy opportunities open up when you have a lot of money."
Now, the main problem that strategy is that the charities don't see benefit until you pass away. Really, you could just give part of your income to charity each year. Or, you could just put 50%/etc. toward the remainder trust instead of the whole thing and the rest could go into your foundation right now. You could then start giving how you want now with the foundation, while receiving income to live off of from the remainder trust which will eventually pay a huge sum to your existing foundation.
Lots of possibilities.

I'm not sure how Canadian taxes work, but my post is regarding charitable transactions. In the US, transferring Bitcoin or other assets to charity is a non-taxable event. That charity can then sell those assets and won't pay any taxes.
It's an incentive for folks to give to charity. They get a big tax deduction without having to pay any tax on the growth of the asset.

It's funny because my high school social studies teacher (not sure which actual class it was that he was teaching at the time) used hand motions to signal swiping down as bear market and bull horns sweeping up as a bull market.
He didn't say this is why they were called these things, but the physical motions helped cement the meanings in our head. He was a solid teacher.
Either way, this post should be somewhere else.
