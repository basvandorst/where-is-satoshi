Bitcoin is money now? What happened to it being property? Ohhhh I get it. The $250,000 revenue for lack of license....

Buy drugs and conflict diamonds first with BTC and then sell those items for cash. If you need help with buying those goods just call your local politician or their friends.
@_date: 2019-10-14 18:04:14
Just buy it

Are you fully synced?

I'd not run a full node on a laptop. Buy a refurbished PC for cheap. Maybe something small like this .
Just replace SSD with 1TB SSD/HD or look for something else with at least 1TB storage capacity.  You could always use the PC for other things besides running a BTC node. Media server for example.
If you just want have a wallet you control, buy a hardware wallet or use a wallet like electrum and have full control of your coins.
