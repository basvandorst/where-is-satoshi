You may jest, but doge is indeed a better choice than bcash :)
At least it doesn't have all of that negative baggage and scammers at the wheel.

Yup, I guess that is so :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:13:58
I think they are smarter than that. The'd either cash out directly at daily intervals or what's more likely hire an economist specifically to sell their coins at better price on the market manipulating them in such a way to gain the most profit. Certainly not dumping just like that :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:26:52
No. Don't spread FUD :)
It's better to be on the safe side for sure, but that's just not the case.
Can it go lower? Sure. But not like your picture is showing.
Recent crash was exacerbated by the mempool getting clogged to shit. Many people were "fuck! bitcoin is unusable, it will be dead tomorrow!", plus we had a lot of weak hands with this recent rally panic selling. Now, however, there isn't any external news to push the price down so much. So, yeah... don't spread bullshit FUD please :)

Again, it is users who pay for transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:13:26
Segwit is already 2X, though. Companies need to start using it ffs...
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:37:17
Very unlikely to actually happen, because pools won't risk their reputation. I'm merely stating the fact that it could, and with ease.

The hell does it even mean?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:37:12
There are already plenty of coins that use PoS and similar algorithms.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:37:54
Because it's users who pay the fees, not companies.
As for why (choose any):
- can't be bothered to implement changes
- "security"
- political agenda
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:01:01
Because they invest in people's education and as a result a lot of people there understand the value of this technology. Meanwhile barbarians like we see in the news for the past 10 years just keep pretending they know everything and that it's a bubble, a ponzi scheme and other bullshit. Yeah... the entire crypto currency innovation is the ponzi scheme... right.

Well, essentially this: 
In application to Bitcoin - it means that you can't tell the difference between two coins. Right now you CAN. For example you know that a certain address is used by terrorists. So if you accept coins from there you ... well, you can imagine consequences - it creates a connection. But if coins are fungible - it's not possible to tell them apart. Fungibility is also very tightly liked to privacy of transactions, which unfortunately Bitcoin doesn't have either (currently it's entirely transparent). There are some good solutions proposed, but we are years away from it being live if ever.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:04:27
Buy them hardware wallets or tell them where they can buy it themselves.
You can thank me later. I also accept tips in bitcoin :)

Frankly I don't think BTC will be the world currency unless we have some MAJOR changes in how it works within the next 2 years or so. But as a store of value - absolutely. But then again, I wish it was the defacto world currency :)

When you move money to exchange - you pay the fees. When you move money out of exchange - you pay the fee. As for small number of transactions that exchanges have to manage their wallets, it is nothing in comparison to the money they are making.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:35:23
Miners decide whether to drop the transaction from the mempool or not. But you can send a command that will cancel your transaction if it hasn't yet been included in the blockchain. Though, very few wallets can do that.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:12:29
This sounds like a great strategy. I'm going to do exactly that next time! :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:45:41

This shows severe lack of understanding what Bitcoin and Crypto currency in general is.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:59:08
But seriously, if we ARE concerned about it that much we need to start using SegWit and adopt schnorr signatures ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:48:42
You need to learn more about how LN transactions work. If the "middleman" goes down and the contract is not fulfilled to the satisfaction of both parties the channel will close and you get all your money back. And if the party is malicious... well, that malicious party will lose THEIR money, and not you.
I'm not saying that LN is THE solution to BTC scaling issue, but it will be extremely useful for a certain a class of use cases.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:13:13
It works the same as any old fiat currency. People trust that it won't go bust. And the larger number of people trust it the more stability the whole ecosystem will have. Not to mention that it is backed by math, unlike fiat which is not backed by anything but promises.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:15:17
Couldn't have said it better myself.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:54:21
You don't need to withdraw your entire bitcoin at once. Just take a little bit  every month and let the rest appreciate in value. If you have enough you will be withdrawing less than it will be appreciating.
Now, 1 BTC might not be enough, but 2-3 could be okay if you can wait 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:28:46
Never leave your coins on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:21:05
You have to remember that LN is not the only solution. There are a lot of other things being worked on that will make it possible to process more transactions on-chain and other approaches like LN.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:00:48
Bitcoin is backed by math. I thought math and laws of the universe is a better backing than some government with debt, but I guess not :)

You are looking at this from the wrong angle. The electricity is not wasted. It is used to secure the network. How much electricity is wasted for heaters in winter? THIS is wasting it by just generating heat. How much energy is wasted for entertainment and other stuff like that? This amount of electricity used in bitcoin is nothing if it enables new world currency.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:32:34
I'm thinking of creating a fork and calling it Beetcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:06:29
Indeed, even by lowest estimations BTC price doubles every year so far. Now, it won't go on like this forever, but 40k in two years is perfectly possible. But I'd bet it will be higher.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:19:57
I see. Thank you for sharing your view.
Still, in my opinion all the things you listed can be figured out after just couple of hours or googling. And if someone can't be bothered to learn about something new before putting money in it... well, it's their choice.
Also, personally I think buying hardware wallet resolves all that. It is just so easy to use like that. Not to mention 100% secure.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:41:05
Not necessarily, there could be a rule that blocks the addresses of that whale in that new fork. This is why fungibility is extremely important. Unfortunately Bitcoin doesn't have it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:55:13
I wonder what if someone receives a "donation" in BTC? Do they need to pay anything in taxes?

You don't have to get defensive. I never said a word about the US. I'm merely talking about individuals giving their opinions on this technology in the news. They have no understanding how it even works.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:08:21
Get themselves hacked, get asked to provide your details to some government or third party exercising power, decide to scam you, etc. Not saying it has to actually happen. The point here is that this possibility exists. And whether you want to take that risk or not.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:58:03
You don't "invest", you buy bitcoin. If you buy 0.5 bitcoin it doesn't matter how much the price changes. You still own 0.5 bitcoin. What changes is your value in USD or other currency depending on BTC price.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:02:38
If I could get get sent my order the same way I would send a transaction in Bitcoin - I would. But international shipping is horrible :(
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:55:20


Yeah, it's called *centralization*. If you want bitcoin to be controlled by barely a dozen mining farms in China then sure, we can increase the blocksize. In fact, that's what Bcash did already. But if we want ordinary people to be able to host nodes than we can't allow blocksize increase as it will destroy current decentralized advantage that bitcoin has.
So, since we can't recklessly increase the blocksize we have to find other ways of scaling. Segwit is merely a prerequisite for other technologies. LN for example, can't easily work without it. And LN is one of the solutions to enable larger number of transactions without being bound to the blockchain for each one individually. And there are more innovations being worked on that will further improve the situation with transaction fees and in other areas.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:30:48
I'd love this to be the case, but it seems we've run out of steam for now and at best the price will keep where it's at in the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:53:23
The thing is - you can have a thousand transactions in a month with zero fees. But then, after one month it will be settled on the blockchain with decently sized fees. So, in fact it can make fees much larger, but because for you, an individual user the fee for a single LN transaction is minuscule - everyone benefits.
Obviously it doesn't work for all transaction types, but for recurring transactions it is the perfect solution. Plus it will free up space on the blockchain for other transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:23:50
Have you opened the price charts in the last week? Read my comment again, I said in the short term. Long term is obviously the moon. But for now I expect the price to stay where it is.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:36:34
I'm not. I'm merely stating that likelihood of that happening is pretty slim, so it's better to avoid spreading FUD that has no basis in actual facts or at least respectable opinions :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:53:55
Nothing will happen what so ever.
The futures will be settled based on Gemini exchange price. And Gemini has at best 1500 BTC volume a day.
I don't expect any significant effect on the market what so ever. Except for one fueled by FUD or FOMO. But not actual trades.
But I could be wrong obviously, so if you have any good arguments against what I wrote above I'd really like to hear it.
Edit: and here's the futures specification 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:04:56
You are assuming that you will be the only person doing it. When most people and especially automated payout services switch to LN the number of transactions will drop significantly.

Yeah... if only people stop FUD-ing now and just wait a bit until all of that is implemented... then they will get their $1,000,000USD bitcoin they wanted :)

Actually, they do disappear. People lose access to their wallets all the time. Though, that decrease in supply isn't by design obviously.

If your coins are on exchange - the exchange is in control, not you. If you have your coins in a hardware wallet or cold wallet made out of steel - you control it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:46:52
BCash is like a shitty Litecoin. But Litecoin is a legitimate project with a good development team, while BCash is just a scam fork by a few millionaires controlling the price and everything about the project.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:09:59
What do you think is difficult in BTC? I think it's super easy. But I'd like to hear an answer for that if you can point a few things out. Genuinely curious.
Sure, you need to learn a few things to understand how it works. But when internet first appeared for general public people didn't know how it worked either. You have to spend couple of hours learning. But once you know the basics bitcoin is ten times easier than anything you'd normally do with your bank, credit card or whatever.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:06:14
This is just bullshit scam site that literally does nothing, but say "oh, we generated some bitcoin for you, now PAY US some MONEY to receive it" :)

@_date: 2017-11-13 10:07:58
Well, you are absolutely correct. But it's an open market. If someone wants to have another coin we can't really do anything about it. The only thing we can do is vote with our wallets and simply not buy coins that are worthless investments and not offer any useful utility and future potential.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:37:53
Bitch cash seems to be rising again though. And it's mostly KRW, around 60% in volume.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:10:54
For a bitcoin? Ofc, anyone would do it!
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:02:54
That might be technically correct, and yet it hasn't happened before. Even with actual deliberate attacks. Maybe bitcoin technology and infrastructure isn't that bad actually. I'm not implying anything here, just merely stating my observation.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:49:39
RemindMe! 11 months
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:17:50
That's why I think when you trade bitcoin you should never use more than 3x leverage unless you REALLY know what you are doing. Even if it means your earnings are much lower than what is potentially possible. But because one can be reasonably sure that bitcoin isn't going to drop more than 50% in a day* you can be sure that overall it will be profitable in the long term.
*Although, with the current price movement you can no longer be sure of that :)

This is a simple mathematical exercise that isn't representative of reality and not an advice on what to do :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:00:56
Well, those attacks do indeed help bitcoin in the long run as they provide information about possible vectors of attack. Future development of the technology takes this available information into consideration when making decisions about future changes to prevent things like that happening in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:40:54
That spike in Bitch cash is solely pushed by KRW though. About 60% in volume.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:03:03
**Disclaimer:** I obviously not intend this graph to be representative of reality. Just a fun calculation I made that is theoretically correct in an ideal world.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:29:38
It was a rhetorical question, but you are absolutely right!

@_date: 2017-11-02 09:57:42
I always say that the price means nothing. Adoption means everything.
The same people who jump to buy bitcoin now will immediately sell when the correction happens out of fear that it will drop even further. As has happened many times already.
Don't buy bitcoin to speculate. Buy bitcoin to use it. The more you actually use it as a currency the more places will accept bitcoin as a payment and THAT will drive the price up in the long term, not speculation.

Different governments tax it differently. The most sensible way it should be taxed is when you change it back to fiat. And let's be real here, it will be taxed. And it already is in many countries. And frankly, I see no problem with that as long as it's sensible.

I learned a valuable lesson today. Even though I was always "hodler for life (c)" I allowed myself to got influenced by FUD. Never again.
BTC will be back up after all this craziness and we will have Lightning Network shortly too, then moon is next stop.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:13:17
Well, I don't invest more than I can bear to lose. But yeah, I get what you are saying. Still, there's this thing called "anti-fragile" and some smart people say it applies for bitcoin. Every attack makes it stronger because it can adapt to make the same attack nonviable in the future. I'm not saying it's actually true, but I do believe that it gives a valuable lesson for the future non the less.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:27:49
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:59:04

How can that instrument be used? I realize it can give a good idea of how much you can expect bitcoin prices to jump around. But for non-geeks and non-economists - is there some practical use aside from getting just the general idea?
