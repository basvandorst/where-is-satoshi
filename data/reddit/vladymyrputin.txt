Oh, no it's basically a long-distance bus. You buy your ticket online and show up a few days later on your day of choice. Think Greyhound type bus service.

I'm not sure. I've used it once and paid via Paypal. They scanned the QR code off my smart phone when I entered.

They can automate "what is bitcoin" questions.

Ok I'm glad I haven't been doing it wrong all this time.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:39:52
Well yes of course.

How do you x-post? Is it just copy/pasting and adding (x-post from at the end?
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:39:29
I didn't think about that. I assumed it does.

It's about as likely as a complete nosedive to $0.10

Venezuela. Zimbabwe.

Of course not. I'm just saying there is much higher volatility in some currencies. 
You wanted sources and I provided them.

The backups are sadly also encrypted. It is on windows and I'll read up on shadow volume.

I wanted to give people healthy eating tips.
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:17:30
Well the company does.

Because it takes longer than 18 hours to transfer money via bank transfer. If he takes longer than 48 hours, they want him to pay 20btc.
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:45:38
No it was a legitimate question. I just wanted to be a dick right back at you. Of course he could pay 10000€ and get some immediately, but firstly, I wanted to see if anyone had tips in regards to ransomware and secondly, I don't want my uncle to pay 10 grand if there's the possibility of paying 6 grand.

There are only ~5 bitcoins for cash sale in germany and sepa bank transfer would take longer than 18 hours I think. 
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:18:49
Thanks man. You're a lifesaver. Which city and where can I meet you there? 
@_date: 2016-09-20 19:34:35
Well you see, this is why I made the damned post.

Basically, bitcoin cash uses an unlimited block size to achieve what bitcoin achieves with segwit and the lightning network: faster transaction times. Each has merits and drawbacks and most hate for the other is undue and stems from the coin's respective echo chamber (r btc and r bitcoin).
Edit: I may have misread your comment. However, I'll leave this up for other passers-by.
