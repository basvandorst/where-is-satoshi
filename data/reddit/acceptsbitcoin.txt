This, for the love of god, everyone move on with their lives.  
'Bitcoin Cash' _is_ terrible marketing though. Should have been called 'Bitcoin Plus' or something more distinct. It's like calling a new car model 'Toyota Vehicle'.

Note: it's not a simple "one side or the other" situation. This simplified framing has created the ridiculous tribalism. The problems at hand are complex computer science, cryptographic, economic, and human behaviour questions. Reductionism is hurting us. More collaboration, testing, reviews -  actual science - is needed, less popularism.

TIL: There are bitcoin taxes.

Well, to be practical, devs can also be, and some likely are, also quite active users and will run the software of their choice and have their say.

The fact that so many bitcoin have been lost like this makes me feel the supply is far more limited than people would believe.

Seriously, the only time I see them is cashing out at the casino. ATMs pretty much all give out $50s in my experience. Fine by me, and if btc gets a minor bump, great.
@_date: 2016-12-19 06:29:02
Yeah but will you show them how and where to buy a coffee with it?
@_date: 2016-12-14 13:49:26
Not very to bitcoin, but warming to blockchain technology in general more recently. A while back there appeared to be an unspoken policy of simply closing (without explanation) Australian bitcoin business's accounts.

Why would he have come to Safeway or anywhere to get it back?

Confirmation bias. Gains in crypto are a massive (and awesome!) anomaly this decade.

Yeah I'm like... huh?  
Bread _is_ $5, at least, for something edible.
Ask us how much a packet of smokes is.

Who is the audience for this appeal? The ignorant don't care about financial sovereignty, and traders who need a constant float on an exchange should already know what they're doing.
@_date: 2017-04-27 11:47:41
Yeah it 'feels' like a badly written / incomplete feature, not a malicious backdoor.  Although looks like blackhats can theoretically exploit under the right conditions.

BTCMarkets mostly, used Coinjar a bit a couple years ago, but don't like the vig on their trading service, prefer being matched to the market on BTCMarkets. Like the novelty of the hedging service and the EFT card but don't use it really anymore.
I use Kraken by sending BTC and switching to alts. I enjoy their front end and depth is better for every coin obviously. Had no issues getting fully verified.  
@_date: 2017-04-14 05:15:53
Yeah I'm having a hard time finding information / thoughts / reviews from anyone else. Came up in my fb advertisements so they're pushing themselves pretty hard. Could be legit. Or could be sending your crypto into a black hole.
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:02:41
I'm so guilty of this.  
I've spent a couple using a Bitcoin connected debit card, but otherwise, the groceries and everyday use case is still pretty lacking for me...
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:45:09
Yeah I'm having trouble understanding this also. If the very first ASICs were coded in this way to begin with, rather than an incremental improvement to firmware, is it still an exploit?  
I can totally understand someone having a potential commercial advantage to want to continue doing so, and I can also see they might want to block protocol changes which negate their advantage.  Not saying it's good or bad, just I can see the logical argument there.
I've no side in the scaling debate, but shouldn't an efficiency gain be applauded? The network's energy usage has been a hot topic since day zero.
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:31:52
In AUD?
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:48:02
I'm in same boat. I don't want to take 'sides' in what I see primarily as competing software development projects.  
I don't buy this 'attack' mentality. Let open source code implementations stand on their own merits, the cream will rise to the top. As they say in the Agile world "if it's painful, do it more frequently, until it's not".  
There's got to be a law of diminishing returns at some point where continual hard forks offer no valuable improvements and fizzle out quickly. At this point you could argue your code base has been through the conceptual grinder, and is stronger for it.  
Isn't it a *good* thing we have hundreds of Linux distros? Although to be fair, if I released a new distro called 'Red Hat' a few people would be upset.  
So I can see the naming standards (what is the true 'Bitcoin') as being contentious here, but not much else.
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:14:44
I agree. I love Bitcoin but this is fairly irresponsible. I think it's cool to make some bet on cryptocurrency, but nowhere near 90% of your super. Diversification and risk management may be "old world" thinking, but it does protect you somewhat.
Good luck though, I applaud the ballsiness even though I'd have slightly different risk appetite. If you're super sure on BTC, you can use this BTC as collateral (you're not moving it anyway) on some DeFi platform like BlockFi and double down on your investment ��

As someone with no real skin in either game, thanks for this summary.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:06:52
This is how conversations should be approached. Glad to see little personal attacks in this thread. I've got a few new things to investigate also.

For full transparency you should mention using your referrer link.

I have had unlimited data connection with no shaping for the last decade for around $60 / month, give or take.
Not *everyone* will have, and to be fair Australian internet is complete pants.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:16:58
The real meaning of the post is always in the comments :). 
Good luck with it all mate
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:33:39
So the problem is the software patent, not the actual optimisation?  
Otherwise, smaller chips would be controversial in mining rigs.  
Am I understanding it correctly? Just seen ASIC boost bandied around recently in regards to the scaling solutions underway and still couldn't understand the "problem" with it.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:39:12
Agree, and posted as such in Old folks in the crypto game will remember silence and "just wait" is the same thing that went on with Butterfly Labs and a dozen other hardware providers afterwards.  Maybe a bit harsh since they're not taking anyone's money for nonexistent products, but the total lack of communication to me is like... _here we go again_.
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:48:10
This is what I was thinking? A screwdriver to unseat the HDD way easier than trying to plug a VGA cable into what I can assume is some sort of bare display bus after the screen was snapped off. Ahh well...
