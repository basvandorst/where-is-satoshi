I do not have the necessary time, but having solved several of these puzzles in the past I would say that based on the given premise:
"Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution", I interpret that the work to be done is to put the words that appear in the image in the order in which they are in the whitepaper. Take the result as a passphrase and make a brain wallet with this.
If this does not work then the second option, would be to use only those that are inside the Bitcoin logo. If this were useful for someone to get to get the prize I will appreciate any donation: 1HUwxzaNoo1Qdw9Sh5esHhAf5FXFZ7tk8N

Sorry, but NdLEoUJCqNLlZFQBKEr7lxTK-PKQjqi5FtBM8k5lqs8 is a hash automatically assigned to the file by Reddit and it is not in control of the user, so they discard that clue completely.
