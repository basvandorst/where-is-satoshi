I find this talk to be more propaganda than informational.  He totally ignores potential problems (even disasters).  Easy example: even a block-chain-provided song will still end up playing through analog wires and speakers.  At that point, anyone can re-record the song, copy it, and share it for free with negligible loss of sound quality.  But much more importantly, in the 1930s, our current banking system solved the centuries-old problem of **bank runs** by having a central authority, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, print up and dish out cash at critical moments.  And just a few years ago, central banks saved the world's financial system, averting another Great Depression, by creating trillions of dollars out of thin air for banks to put on their screwed-up balance sheets.  I don't think such a centrally controlled response to crisis could be done in a crypto-currency world, because nobody can "print" more Bitcoins than the algorithms allow for.  The 2008 crisis was largely caused by private, secret transactions (Credit Default Swaps) that nobody had an overall picture of.  Yet privacy and secrecy are what Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are all about!  We **just had a financial crisis** mainly due to a mania in **private transactions**  in which people and institutions were free to do what they have done over and over: follow their emotions, gamble on odds they don't understand, and produce a massive economic bubble that inevitably bursts.  Unless crypto-currencies and their supporters engineer a way to deal with such human behavior, I think our future might bring a massive depression that no central authority can prevent or respond to.

In Comedy Isn't Pretty, Steve Martin said, "Comedy is an agreement between you and the audience that you are funny."  The audience laughed!

Sell immediately.  *To me.*  :-D

No there doesn't.  Many can sell to the same buyer.  (Which is what happens at market bottoms, FYI.)

You think paper money has no "actual" value, but gold and Bitcoins do?  There are damn good reasons we abandoned the gold standard all those years ago.  Google it.  Further, we just had a financial crisis 9 years ago that was caused by unregulated banks being free to massively gamble with borrowed money in secret.  Bitcoin would not have saved us from that.  And Bitcoin would have prevented the emergency measures that the Fed and Treasury took to prevent Great Depression 2.0.  FYI, Great Depression 1.0 was caused by deflation, something Bitcoin allows.  (Well, if you ignore the fact that ANYONE can create a new kind of "coin" out of thin air: Litecoins, Dogecoins, shitcoins, etc.)  Bitcoin also allows old fashioned bank runs, something rare thanks to FDIC insurance, but which swept through investment banks and money markets in 2008.  Those runs were halted by the Fed when they stepped in and guaranteed deposit accounts, aided by their ability to judiciously create money out of thin air.  And notice they did it with little apparent inflation.

I recommend the OP do both, i.e., sell 2 BTC to get back the original $1000, but hold on to the rest in case they appreciate more.
