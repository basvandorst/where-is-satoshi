Odroid actually so its a souped up Korean pi.
Cool concept.  Make one yourself!

Right.  I had to go so i just threw some parts together.  the Bitnodes price is not ridiculous at all.  But lets be honest, who buys ethernet cables and cables like that at that price.  The only one I see on the site that is worth the price is the little HDMI thing.
Regardless, bitnodes is also taking bitcoin for this thing, which odroid does not.  I think the price is fair enough.

Am I wrong to say that the way they do business is just so Chinese?  Not a racist thing, this is the textbook style of how business is done in China.  Huobi is probably doing the same crap.

They are running this on Ubuntu and Django, its open source here:
The reason this probably won't work on the Pi is because of the Pi's limitations, and the blockchain is still growing.
In fact, you'll probably find a few nay-sayers in this thread saying that the odroid's (the rpi like thing they are using) is probably not going to stay up to par for too long.
Same parts, didn't price hunt, but you can build one yourself.
Their price is not ridiculous, but I'm sad they aren't being open about it (although they have open sourced their code... so kudos).
