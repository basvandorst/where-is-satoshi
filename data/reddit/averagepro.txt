Yes, to process the network. Not just for gaining BTC.

Oh.. Oh..  But I sold themfor 1020 USD..  I'll keep waiting I think..  I'd mtgox known to just abandon verifications?  I chose that exchange as at the time they seemed to have a good reputation

Okay, if it is 1 TB you want to enter 1024 in replace of 500 in the above instructions. For me scanning 750 GB took pretty much a full day.

Thanks for the info. Ouch that's long. Would you recommend to buy back BTC , sell them on Bitstamp and withdraw to an EU bank using Bitstamp?

You're right the instructions out there are not geared at newcomers. Here are some simplified instructions:
So from what I understand you have deleted the wallet.dat off a drive that does not have your operating system. It's important to stop using this drive for now, the file you deleted is probably not 'gone' rather it's position on your drive is marked as 'free space' and therefore is liable to be overwritten with new content should you continue using the drive. That aside, here are instructions - 
1. Download and install Python (you will need this to operate pywallet) .  download this package and install .
2.  Download pywallet from  
3. Unzip pywallet to your Desktop
4. You should now have pywallet residing in a path like this -C:\Users\Name\Desktop\pywallet-master 
5. Start up cmd as an administrator. 
        Start Menu &gt; Type 'cmd' into the search box &gt; right click CMD  and click 'Run As Administrator 
6.  In the console we now want to change directory to where you unziped pywallet to. So therefore type into there the following 'cd C:\Users\Name\Desktop\pywallet-master' . Obviously not including the quotations and replacing Name for your windows username.
7. Now find the drive letter for the drive which you deleted wallet.dat off and it's size. I'll assume it's E:/ for this but substitute as necessary and it was a 500 GB drive.
8. Next is actually running pywallet and telling it to hunt E:/ for the private keys (notice we're not looking for an actual file called wallet.dat) . 
9. Type into the console (change E for the real drive letter and change 500 to the size in GB the drive is)
**pywallet.py --recover --recov_device E: --recov_size 500Gio --recov_outputdir C:\recovered_wallets**
10. This should start pywallet and it will begin to ask you questions, firstly the password you want your new wallet to have - enter a password and don't forget it! . If you password protected your lost wallet enter it's password.  Pywallet will now run and will probably take a long time, when it is finished it will throw all the private keys into a new password protected wallet.dat in the folder C:\recovered_wallets . Move this wallet into the data directory of Bitcoin-qt and start it up, with any luck your BTC will be recovered 
If you are still confused/stuck PM me and I will explain it again, there is hope!

How long did your SEPA bank account take to validate? Ie. how long after entering your IBAN etc were you able to make your first withdrawal?

Use pywallet to recover the keys, this will dump them into a new wallet.dat . Then move the new wallet.dat into your bitcoin-qt data directory. Restart bitcoin-qt and you should have your BTC back.
Do not write to the drive you just deleted them off.

Seriously? What makes you say that?
