Re-earn it in a year? So you put a year worth of pay into bitcoin? Seems not a smart idea to begin with.

I know what you mean. It's only a loss if you sell them. I've had this happen to me with dogecoin in late december. It went from 180 to 30 satoshi's, with me buying at 90. It sucked. But after a month it went to 250, and then 290 due to media attention and a halvening in blockrewards. It's now back to 100. The only regret I've had is not buying at 30. I've bought more now at 98 and expect it to rise again since there is another halvening in 2 weeks.

Bter.com / cryptsy.com for btc trades. Kraken.com / prelude.io for USD trades. You can also use coinsachs.com to buy with paypal but its a bit more expensive than the exchanges.

Great now everyone knows where he lives, who he is and who is family is. Great reporting. He needs some serious protection after this story. Maybe move to another country and get another name. I don't know what that reporter was thinking. Why do you reveal that much of a person.

Really... needs to loosen their buttcheeks a bit. You can crack a nut between them right now. Vote brigading because some of us here actually like dogecoin?

I wouldn't be into crypto if it wasn't for doge. I now have doge, btc, ltc, vertcoin and some a tiny tiny bit of auroracoin. Bitcoin was honestly a bit scary for me at the beginning. The bitcoin community is also a bit harsh to noobs from my experience so that didnt help. Doge is waaaay easier to get into. At least it was for me.

I hope that is fake, because I want to punch that guy in the face.

Lol which chart have you been looking at. A few weeks ago when btc had 10% ups in the proces of going up from 450$. I suggest investing in less volitile shares/stocks if you can't handle the crazy world of crypto.

I had times where I thought the world was over. I was trying to suicide a couple of times (not because of crypto crashes, personal issues). This may sound cliché but things will get better even though right now it seems that it never will be. Hang in there man. Your son needs you more than ever right now. It will get better I promise. I don't know how to help you but all I got is this bit of doge I got left on my tipbot. +all doge verify
