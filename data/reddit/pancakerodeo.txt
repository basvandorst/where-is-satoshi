Do you think btc will become a viable currency though? I'm still learning about the technical side of cryptos and it's overwhelming/fascinating. What I can't seem to understand is that if btc fails to become useful as a means of transaction, how will it retain its value as an asset? I see comparisons to gold/silver but I feel like that's a flawed assumption. Precious metals have physical applications and can also be used as a medium for exchange and therefore value. If I buy one bitcoin, what can I do with it other than hope it appreciates to then trade it for a physical good or fiat?

Yeah I'm with you. I was just reading some cnbc article about some guy predicting the next 10 things to happen with btc. One of them was talking about how it's a likely going to be the currency that's relied upon once either Venezuela or Argentina's collapses.

Yeah they're obviously going to try to keep themselves relevant and attempt to prove their coin is better.

Right I agree with you there. I have no idea whether it's used more in electronics, jewelry making, hedging, or by Trump(heh). I'm just saying that there's demand and it has utility. China either already did, or is about to introduce oil futures contracts that can be settled in gold, and I imagine there are plenty of under the table transactions that happen without a trace. Btc has demand, but without it being able to make transactions where is the utility? Maybe hedging? That's what I think is difficult for people to get their minds around. It's awesome, but at the end of the day if it can't be used to transact, it's very complex code that the world collectively agrees has value because we're all sick of the deck being stacked against us right? It's just crazy to me.
Edit, grammar.

I don't think that, it's clearly bought/sold/uses all the time. I was making the point that if it's not eventually more widely adopted as a form of practical payment (making it a currency) its value would take a hit. Certainly more practical than gold.

So I think that's my point. Strictly looking at btc as an asset to hold, what are it's advantages other than its ability to be transferred between parties? Btc holders are relying on its demand &amp; scarcity alone to drive value?

Thanks, yeah most of that makes sense to me haha. I'm just thinking it needs to retain its transactional utility to keep a large amount of its value to some extent. Otherwise it becomes a digital asset like Panda was talking about above. In order to do that (in the long run at least) something like this lightning network will need to be implemented.

Yeah sure,
