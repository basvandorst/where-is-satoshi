Looks like we are seeing exactly what happened before. If this is truly the case we are in for one hell of a ride.

Looks like we are finally getting out of this bear market which is a natural cycle of any financial market/commodity. We once we break $4,200 we should breakout and we should expect this to happen by April 11th.
Will be posting more on twitter [

He's a billionaire who just lost probably 30% of his money. That'll show him.

I don't give dates for price targets. But I would not be surprise if it was by the end of the year
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:09:48
Its not an opinion its a fact
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:57:16
It crashes every time it hits 8888 yuan, its never been above 8888 yuan, ever

He never denied having possession of that amount of bitcoin, as far as the article suggests. Perhaps he is just denying the defraud part?
@_date: 2019-04-20 22:12:41
10 billion actually
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:07:10
Did you read the article? It says it in there...
@_date: 2019-04-10 23:49:14
Ah so you’re one of those.
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:04:50
Doesn't matter, even if it is he could have created/had a second bitcoin address and just transferred it there. No one would even know, its quite clever actually.
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:06:00
Yeah the bigger picture is 24 hour transaction times and 30 dollar transaction fees
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:10:42
2k is my ETH prediction which i have posted on my charts

If you buy now it looks good (.0000737). Stop sell at 0.000734. Resistance at 0.0000787 (soft) followed 0.0001 (hard).

If I was a whale I wouldn't be wasting even a second of my time posting on reddit. I'd rather drive one of my 5 lambos.
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:53:28
Do you have them hours for a transaction to confirm?
@_date: 2019-04-10 23:57:46
I was referring to Bitcoin being at 28k, not ETH.

OP is right, Bitcoin is like that phone. Why would anyone want to use that thing when you can usr a smart phone like Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:22:08
Doesnt matte if there are even only 1 million bitcoins available when there a new alt coin being made every day diluting down the "scarcity" of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:24:02
Yeah demand it cant keep up with, its poised to collapse
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:20:56
It wont happen without a fork producing two different types of coins, the miners/devs are all arguing with each other 
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:45:42
200,000 unconfirmed transactions and growing, with insane fees. Bitcoin is reaching a tipping point and can't sustain the demand. Even if the block size was increased from 1mb to 8mb it still wouldn't be enough. Looks like people are switching over to ETH.
