[The global 1% apparently starts at a little under $900k net worth]( It's a bit easier to see that people's fortunes could go up or down at that level. Like a small business owner could grow up into that level and then suffer a setback that knocks them back down. Or a person could save up that much then retire and drawn down their investments. 
But I would actually guess that the people marginally in the 1% probably make up a much bigger portion of that group. The ultra wealthy with true generational wealth are a small fraction of even the 1%.

"Quantitative Easing" in the U.S. doesn't refer to the interest rate. It's a euphemism for an extraordinary program of the government buying up bank assets on a massive scale. Calling it QE makes it sound like it's just normal policy of adjusting the monetary base with the interest rate, something they've been doing for a long time. When they say QE is winding down, they're saying they're ceasing to buy up all those assets. So QE could end without the interest rate changing at all.

It's by a "contributor", so it's not even a Forbes employee. It's essentially a random blogger that is publishing on their platform, and has little to do with Forbes itself aside from trading on the name.

This wouldn't be the first time. Bitcoin price slowly declined for like almost 2 years after the original Gox hack back in 2011.

Mtgox collapse wasn't one of the biggest bitcoin moments of the year?

Is that what they say? I thought the criticism was that we use linear charts when the price is going up, log charts when the price is going down.

The thing about Forbes though is that they essentially let bloggers just use their name in exchange for add revenue. The author of this article, as well as many other we see around here from Forbes, is not a Forbes employee. They are a 'contributor'. You can read a bit more about it [here](

A couple of people have said this and I'm not quite sure I understand it. The reason people complain about insider trading isn't because it changes the price (insiders are buying/selling in anticipation of a news release that is supposed to change the price anyways), it's because it is unfair. Some people might [disagree that it is unfair]( but even if the market were large enough that insiders couldn't shift the price, that wouldn't mean that the issue would be resolved for people who are upset by it. It would just mean that it would be harder for everyone to detect.

I'd like to point out a very good book that I think is relevant here: [The Innovator's Dilemma]( The book offers an explanation of why big companies often seem to miss the boat when it comes to new technologies. The argument is that new technologies come to prominence via a strange pattern. When the technologies start out, they are inferior to current tech used in the industry, but do have some utility in certain very niche areas. These areas are often not as profitable or large as the customer base that market leaders currently focus on. But in serving these niche users, the new tech has time to develop, improving over time to compete directly with the old tech for the broader market. The companies that reigned previously are caught off guard by the fact tech that was not fit for purpose when they first looked at it is suddenly taking over their business.
In terms of bitcoin, there are quite a few uses for which it is already great tech. Sending money to a friend, whether they're sitting next to you or in another country, is crazy great with bitcoin. So while I don't think Bitcoin is ready right now to take over the entire consumer market, there are certainly some places where it can continue to be useful while it potentially develops into something most people would want to use for all sorts of transactions.
The key there is 'potentially'. The Innovator's Dilemma doesn't predict that all crummy tech will eventually improve to the point that it takes over the industry. Just that it is a pattern that can be seen to have happened in several different industries.

The agenda is to get people to read their blogposts. That's how they generate revenue. There's lots of people writing about it on forbes because as stocks-to-crypto mentioned it's a blogging platform. It takes very little to get on their platform and publish clickbait stuff, so a lot of people will just jump on whatever trend to try and get some of that sweet revenue. They don't need the people reading their blogposts to aggree with what is written, so the fact that you're sharing their links here is pretty much what they are hoping for.

Honestly just about every reason that people gave back at the start for why bitcoin would succeed turned out to not be true, except that the price would rise. Not anonymous, not beyond government regulation, banks are moving into the space not being replaced by it, transactions aren't necessarily cheap, and it's not super decentralized at this point. But the price does keep going up, so we got that going for us which is nice.
