More to come.
@_date: 2015-06-26 04:59:08

@_date: 2015-12-07 00:54:39
To the moon ?
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:20:00
Cloudbet I've used for 3 years. I've off and on with sports betting nothing crazy but Bitcoin is the only way to go.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:15:06
You can use to see who is online also.*typo fixed
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:34:07
 specifically. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:55:56
That is my other acct. I've submitted it to and it came back true. So will have to wait to see what they say.
@_date: 2015-06-03 04:50:14
Yes, this has been mentioned before. Make sure to drop a message [here]( to let them know!
There are boobies [NSFW]  :) - We verify each stream that shows up in @_date: 2015-06-17 02:59:05
Never to late to buy BTC everyday something amazes me :)
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:27:57
@_date: 2015-06-03 05:03:53
Added :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 02:40:25
Haha ya seems to be the case.
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:01:37
Yes, was thinking that. I don't think they have a way to add additional fields. I'm looking now :)
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:52:04
Btw: This guy is the infamous Bitcoin scammer [TradeFortress]( one of the biggest Bitcoin scammers in the world. They got the wrong guy as TradeFortress lives in AUS.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:45:59
Thx. good suggestion
@_date: 2015-06-12 18:57:23
like you mean the way they've set it up ?
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:59:06
Cool. Make sure to drop it in when you can.
@_date: 2015-06-01 03:59:34
It is real.
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:44:11
just don't date lorena bobbitt .
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:56:11
It is a good question. Be curious to hear this also.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:25:38
I'll check this out also!
@_date: 2015-06-01 03:59:34
It is real.
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:59:03
Thanks for this. I'll check it out.
@_date: 2015-06-03 03:17:38
I suppose that is the one downside so far of streamium is there is no description of what users are seeing at the moment , but that should change. I'm not on the stream right now so can't confirm what is going on.
**Update:** just was in there the stream is super slow and there is a girl ( don't know if real) hopefully they will add chat soon and audio.
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:45:57
lol I was just revisiting that whole story right now ...HOLY OWW!!!
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:30:44
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:50:59
watch out this is a scam.
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:39:21
Any devs want to put together a directory of Streamium streams ?
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:15:47
@_date: 2015-05-29 04:41:34
The boys are working hard! 
@_date: 2015-05-24 05:45:17
Yes. I was just thinking that also. Essentially, we need a place to let people know they are up and streaming.
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:52:14
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:52:50
Check out does just that.
@_date: 2015-05-15 04:34:44
Check out people tip you in bits of BTC and you can give them a free chapter or two in return right to their reddit inbox :)
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:38:05
this is the most mind blowing news I've seen re: Bitcoin. I've been with it since the start.
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:14:40
Right, but what does it mean ? what is this ?
None, of those results tell me what excatly is this.
@_date: 2015-05-11 02:36:27
Sports betting. Totally changed the way I do things.
@_date: 2015-05-24 06:27:40
I literally was just going to post this haha.... but ya chargebacks.
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:13:59
Ya I've seen that now :)
@_date: 2016-03-26 23:51:40
Yes, that is the use-case for it so to speak. Good to know.
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:03:39
Right. Chargebacks can happen ,but got a pretty good way against it. What is considered a high fee these days ? Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2015-05-30 05:33:47
I would have said bitcoinstarter.com but it is down.
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:54:13
someone needs to create a list of all the books on Bitcoin out there. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 06:30:45
ya looking forward to getting this also.
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:31:57
This sub I created directly links to each stream . Keeps everything nice and orderly and says offline/online.
@_date: 2015-05-24 05:49:22
Imagine the gyro copter dude who flew into the capital lawn doing this :)
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:06:29
Right, that is what it was set at. Make sense.  The only advantage to go with us vs. coinbase is there is no registration etc.,etc.  Good feedback thanks.
@_date: 2016-03-26 23:40:25
Right. This was geared for people who like to gamble a little bit here and there without all the hassle. Good to see there is want for it so far it seems.
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:47:03
You should check out they plan on being the full-circle for this.  Tip/lead -&gt; small on the fly store page.
@_date: 2016-03-27 20:06:12
That does suck I didn't know that.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:11:40
Mostly digital goods. You are actually familiar with the subreddit.
@_date: 2016-03-27 20:00:30
Thanks for the list. I'm seeing so much registration for this trying to figure out a better way.
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:19:29
This is Netflix ?
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:36:57
Heineken cracked open!
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:42:16
They are always busy working on things so things can break once in awhile.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:02:06
This guy just do this guide:
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:37:50
Along with the other 12 other posts :P haha ...all good fun!
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:44:32
Dude, post on hahaha ...
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:42:51
You would die and not be able to enjoy your fortune lol
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:26:42
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:31:01
Hahaha ;-)
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:51:18
Does Mr. Robot send people bitcoins ?
@_date: 2015-07-11 18:46:36
This weekend.
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:31:50
Couldn't agree more!
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:09:58
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:02:29
There is a [NSFW] using PopChest being developed also called [NakedBitcoins](
@_date: 2012-03-24 20:17:11
I like your thinking. Please update this post if you head over to bitcointalk.org . Thanks!
edit 1: there is all   which has good traffic and activity.
edit 2:  I've used betsofbitco.in   loved it - so might seem a lot of people don't use something but they do.
@_date: 2012-03-28 05:41:46
looking forward to this.
@_date: 2012-03-28 05:43:28
can't wait for it!
@_date: 2012-03-28 05:42:36
bitbeer ?
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:06:06
It is just sell - &gt; cash. 
@_date: 2015-04-11 19:42:28
In other words, bitcoin is the most transparent money the world has ever seen.
@_date: 2015-04-26 06:30:08
It isn't an exchange in the true sense.  It will just convert out crypto to cash with a better incentive to do so. Like not having to sign up a million times to things. I guess I answered my own question a bit. I'm trying to see what other things people would want to see implemented to push them over to something else because yes competing against CB and exchanges in that sense.
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:33:40
Yup! I hear you. I was more thinking if you were to design a service that you would rather go sell your Bitcoins on to say bank account or paypal or whatever what would you want to see in it.  But, I get it!
@_date: 2015-04-11 19:46:15
I got a Bitcoin Boner.
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:00:11
Not quite. A person has BTC right and they send it in to covert to cash. There is no need to hold BTC.  Will thats what I'm saying I can do a customization of some sort to price it better as in give more cash. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:17:01
I agree. So basically even a card of some sort that lets you take out cash ( maybe, even in the currency of the country you are in ). Good suggestion.
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:21:36
Not sure why the DV ?
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:40:13
Strange stuff. It only betters the whole Bitcoin economy if people help others market their services and products ,but that is just me.
@_date: 2015-11-22 01:54:06
Two good places.
I think I read where Bitcoin subreddit ad space is totally booked deep into 2016 so that isn't an option.
Bitcointalk.org they way they auction of adspace is odd and confusing unless things have changed.
At least these are two places. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:02:09
@_date: 2015-11-17 20:16:56
Strange ok.
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:46:40
Yes, heard about them. You've used them ?
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:37:34
Honestly, I personally don't have anything , but was planning on something I just don't know what yet. Then I became curious how would anyone go about selling anything here. Its disturbing this isn't the top of thread right now with many ideas.
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:28:55
Thank you added to my list! I'll make an official guide soon so we don't have to go through this!
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:12:28
Yes, Ad at Bitcointalk is one way of doing it very true. I like that suggestion. I was just wondering what other 3rd party methods there are.
@_date: 2015-11-28 06:37:47
In bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:44:04
Totally agree.
@_date: 2015-11-22 01:53:17
Thanks. I really do think there should be defintive guide or something to this. I've asked this numerous times and nobody ever gives an answer when I post here. I'm building my own guide and will share it here shortly.
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:46:54
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:29:39
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:39:28
Does anyone know if btc-e is in on this ? I mean  do we even know who owns btc-e ?
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:47:04
Sure. Address ?
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:04:07
Why you say that ?
No, this is non-drug related. I'm saying items for sale would be ipads, jewlery etc.,etc. Sorry, should have made it more clear.
@_date: 2015-11-17 20:17:10
Ok odd for sure.
@_date: 2015-03-27 06:02:20
Hey, whatever makes us money. You might get the the uptick on the send back.
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:26:40
Eh a little different.
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:59:09
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:29:24
I'm not sure. I think its expensive also.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:42:29
[DOPE]( ,[DOPE](  plus, the got listed on [SilkRoadReloaded]( can now buy ma drugs!
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:44:24
Its good to know what he is up to no ?
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:40:50
No problem . It was BitZino. One of the first services I used when I got into BTC. Even it was bit dust I would be happy.
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:40:20
Lol this comment was epic phinn
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:56:14
I shall pass it on! I promise!
@_date: 2015-11-22 03:15:45
Thanks for this sources.
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:16:35
I just sold for that amount just fine.
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:30:44
total insanity I agree. And to think they actually put other companies on top of this ?
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:29:36
I got dinged by CB for my gambling lol
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:46:07
lol 
@_date: 2016-07-09 00:34:05
I'm at 4 now lol
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:34:20
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:24:39
This ^^
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:00:02
Totally, make sense. Can I PM you ? The BTC won't be going to be directly to me but to the programmer who I've done business with before.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:56:57
Lol. I know it comes across that way uggh ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:37:02
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:07:49
Right. And at the moment only one transaction per person to start with because I can see people buying $20 dollars worth 5 x's . 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:00:57
k...what amounts of interest to you? I was only thinking of doing $1, $5 and $10 to start.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:12:08
Which one should I go with in your opinion BitStamp? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:18:44
I need to figure out how to integrate with the website. I'm still having to put this up on a webpage then I can PM you when ready.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:04:38
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:03:12
I just want that asian chick to sit on my face!
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:06:42
Interesting haha ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:18:12
lol ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:08:40
This is one area Bitcoins should be able to do is provide small amounts of BTC to people. Sometimes someone just needs $1, $5 quick.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:25:43
Do you know what the [Bitcoin TipBot]( uses for an exchange price? Could even do it right through that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:53:09
that is how it felt.
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:30:43
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:00:24
Can I PM you ?
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:06:47
Hi Jesseinman,
Yes, I know a lot of peeps are kicking themselves for sure. I'm sure it will drop down again shortly. At the moment, I'm only interested in selling small amounts of BTC @ the moment.  In the future, I might do larger amounts.  I just want to get a little bit of return on what I have.  Good luck with your search mate!
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:59:24
please do!! was going to go myself also.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:07:42
Will do thanks!
