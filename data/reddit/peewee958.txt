I reckon trump will be left holding the bag. But the seeds were sown in 2008.

In Europe you’ve got the extremely high cost of living in Scandinavia or the you could live in Romania for a fraction of the price.

If it breaks 10700 I think we’re going to see 4 digit BTC.

At record low zombie interest rates. It’s not really worth that at all.

I bought a 10 trillion Zimbabwe dollar note off eBay a few days ago for 8 of the queens finest pounds delivered. I know I’ve been had but I’m well chuffed with it. Wasn’t prepared to shell out north of £50 for the 100 trillion one though.

It’s a bit obvious now. A disaster waiting to happen. I can’t for the life of me understand why this isn’t mainstream in the BTC community. 
This guy must be pulling his hair out.

A lot of bitcoins’ problems seem to arise from exchanges (centralisation). Is there no way to operate the system without them? There was bitcoin before the first exchange was created but is mass adoption even possible without exchanges? What functions do they perform that cannot be replaced.

Don’t go with the best offer. Go with the guys with most feedback and longest on the site. People been stung months after the transaction occurred by scammers charging back banks saying the transaction was fraudulent etc. So don’t be greedy and take what looks like the safest deal not the best one.

This was my favourite bit of the dip so far.

That’s just run of the mill criticism mate. Cyberbullying would be sending that to your parents to show them what a let down you are.

There’s a detailed section in the FAQs written by Brits that have went through the process. Seems like a nightmare tbh. Good luck mate!  
And if it’s anything over £5k I’d speak to your bank and make sure they know it’s coming.

Bull pennant, original parabolic curve blah blah. I see a tangental rooster. Or maybe it’s a rising fire eagle. You cant actually believe this stuff surely? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:49:36
Duno mate. Look at all the prospective buyers profiles and decide for yourself. Check account age, number and volume of transactions, feedback and method of payment. Good luck.

What made you buy as an investment back then? The volatility scared me off holding it for more than the time it took to complete my transactions. TBH I never for a minute thought it would get to the stage it is today. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:42:37
With no update in sight to scale bitcoin it can’t function as a currency. It’s value as an asset it based on confidence. This could be terminal. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:19:06
Both probably!

Trading has been suspended. 
Oh wait it’s bitcoin. HODL!!!

Is Japan’s uptake in Bitcoin anything to do with its economic situation? Huge debt, printing unprecedented amounts money, low growth, population crisis etc. Are the Japanese losing confidence in the Yen?

It’s doing some crazy shit from 0045 onwards too. WTF?

People who value money and material things will always want more. If you can be genuinely content without all that BS then that’s one less thing to worry about in life. Better being poor and happy. 
It’s a bit of a cliche but for me all the best things in life are free. Laughter, family, sex, friends, beautiful women, nature. Only a fool would value houses and cars more than any of those things.

They’re just picking off the small guys. Letting the market re-inflate then BOOM! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:59:48
Your guess is as good as anyone else’s on here. At this stage investing in bitcoin is a gamble. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:27:41
Reckon it will stabilise somewhere between 9-13K for a few days then fall off a cliff again. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:00:57
When hedge funds etc come out and say publicly that they are going to invest in bitcoin it makes me a bit suspicious. 
Are they under any obligation to do this legally? 
Why would you make an announcement that could drive up the price of an asset that you are planning to buy? 
The cynic in me says they already hold significant amounts and are trying to inflate the price. I mean it’s stupid to think that Wall St in only getting in on the act now. They’ve probably been hodling longer than your average hodler. 
Thoughts?

The plan is to hide the paper wallets and gold and forget about. I don’t think I’ll need it for 5 years+.

At $15K there seems to be a lot wiling to cash in. Hopefully it can break through that mark in the next day or two. Would be a real sign of intent. Here’s hoping.

Fuck that. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:53
Then why doesn’t the price do that at other round numbers? I’ve never seen it before anyway.

The question of how low this might go can be answered by another one. 
When do people think this bull market started? Start of December? January? 2106?

Haha. I’ve gave thought to what would be most valuable in a financial apocalypse. Stuff to barter with. How a bike is more useful than a car etc. I don’t think it’ll be a doomsday scenario though.

From the ATH at $19891 on Dec 17th until it hit $10700 today bitcoin fell 46.2%. 
Was that the bottom?
