very interesting, unfourtunatley with todays geopolitical climate its a good shout. Thanks for the reply. Im gonna use a soft wallet with 2FA until i get the Nano s..

Coinase is pretty secure tho compared to the other exchanges  
@_date: 2016-11-11 20:15:57
soft wallets are safer than i thought then, maybe i'm being too paranoid? Or trusting exchanges too much..
How much would you store on a soft wallet for ether say? as they don't have hardware yet - 10k?

Think you've very well hit the nail on the head here. This was my initial thoughts also. They also pay hackers to find loopholes- at the very least, with exchanges like Poloniex and Kraken around no one will bother trying to take down Coinbase. Very good reply, thanks.
Will definitely be moving my funds into the multi-sig, had no idea.

its fundementally wrong to keep your money with a third party when you can hold it yourself, youre right.. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:05:25
feel so stupid for trusting Coinbase just because its a big institution -great example of social conditioning tbh!
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:07:23
just found out theres soft wallets other than Jaxx that have 2FA, much safer if youre worried about security 
@_date: 2016-11-11 21:08:49
Great, its not as as good as safe as Trezor app, but it gets the job done pretty well, right? Do you know how it works
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:25:22
Never heard of it will have a look, thanks.

Appreciate the reply. Do you recommend the Nano s?  Or shall i wait for the jaxx hardware- Icecube if im not mistaken? How long will that be, can we get a ball park figure? 
@_date: 2016-11-11 20:11:52
when do you reckon itll hit the markets. Im looking for hardware for ether myself 
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:43:56
whats your veiws on the Nano s then- for eth
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:42:27
ok, but isnt it more likley that your phone (jaxx wallet) will get hacked than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:04:31
how do you know it will start at parity? 
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:07:38
Thanks. I hope so. Ether is in a crazy bear atm and btc looks to hit 1300 soon. The enterprise ethereum coming on the 14th should have a major effect on price, or is it already priced in?
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:07:28
thing is i cant even w/draw to a btc wallet- i used ether so it should be fine?
