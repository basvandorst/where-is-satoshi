You're off your rocker if that is the conclusion you draw. I agree in theory that not spending money stunts the economy but having a mutable and arbitrary interest rate only serves the purpose of making it harder for the masses to save and invest capital. Furthermore, how do you justify your logic with respect to tax cuts on the rich? They are hoarding capital more than the masses could collectively and subsequently have every industry under their thumb through the securities market.

It is completely a zero-sum game. No wealth is ever created, you can only fight for market share or create something new that wealthy people want to buy. 
The internet took over the publishing/postal/telecom industry, among others. Uber didn't just create value out of nothing, it centralized the taxi industry market share.  


Only a wealthy person could perceive it this way. Here are some ways the right steals from "you;"
De-funding Education
Lobbying to prevent Medicare/Medicaid from being able to negotiate drug prices

The wealth you mentioned is figurative and none of it is comparable to the sheer volume of wealth we are discussing

I'd trace it back to feudalism but yes essentially, little wealth has shifted since we started instituting modern monetary policy
