"In Tether we Trust" 
Guess who got the fresh printed tether 7 hours ago just when bitcoin were short to break psychological 10000 ??? 
Bitfinex Exchange got from tether "personally" a suitcase with $100 000 000 in unmarked 100 notes the weight about 1000kg and save the crypto world again.
This is fully developing into PONZI scheme
We all will be pissed off when any big HODLer will decide to withdraw his funds and bitfinex and tether will be declared insolvent
Artificial pumps to save the banks in 2008 were the reson bitcoin were invented by satoshi nakamoto now we are in same game
This will not end good.

To explain in simple...
There are currently 15k BTCs per day on market in all Exchanges together.
For a half a year only bitfinex were trading 10k btc now at most 5k.

Seems everybody is convinced that the high trading volumes of BTC were fake.
This makes my point stronger that there will be a crush as soon as traders making fake trades will be back into market.

Volatility is also rising, close to situation in 2013.
High volatility means every short seller with a small volume of BTC could force a crush selling.

Volatility is nice for speculations, means traders, but not for business..
But if you prefer to have bitcoin as an object of speculation, then you will lose in any case.
