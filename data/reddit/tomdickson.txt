Your upline is the miners you pay fees to on the coins you receive; your downline is the miners you pay fees to on the coins you send, I guess.

In theory an "unstable store of value" could work if it was heading *predictably* in a given direction - for example, the dollar's inflation can be *roughly* predicted and so t-bills are a usable unstable store of value.

The “we can’t all have lambos” is the key. And if bitcoin becomes king and there are too few bitcoiners, the people will rise up and “confiscate” them quite bloodily. Or ignore them entirely.

Gold has intrinsic properties and therefor intrinsic value, even if that intrinsic value might be quite low; there are certain things the element AU can be used for that nothing else can, or does it worse.
You can't argue that gold has no intrinsic value but a "legacy and brand name" does.
And if "legacy and brand name" is all that matters, CocaColaCoin™ will surpass them all.

Correction^*[to* ^*what?]* as old wikipedia would say.
"Correction" implies there is a "true and proper price" that it went above (or below) for a time; this makes sense with *securities* that go above or below an average P-to-E ratio; but makes no sense with a *currency* which bitcoin purports to be (or is it a store of value now?).

Many of the attacks would *cripple* the coin but they can survive. Block seizing happened to bitcoin cash - there wasn't enough miners to mine the blocks until a difficulty adjustment could be done; so the chain "stopped" - but they updated the software to do an emergency difficulty adjustment (EDA).
In the worst case scenario, if 99% of bitcoin's miners turned off right after a difficulty adjustment, it could take 2000+ blocks until the next adjustment, and each block could take 1000+ minutes to find. After about 4 years the difficulty would reset to 10 minutes per block. But I suspect emergency code changes would come into play before that time.
Even if a coin survives one of these catastrophic (but unlikely) events, it would probably have its value shaken pretty substantially.

Don’t try to entirely avoid tax and report your cost in fiat and gains in fiat and you’ll probably be fine. IRS doesn’t have enough agents and as long as you don’t appear to be trying to hide gains you should be fine.

Assume a decentralized currency identical to Bitcoin but with a 2MB block instead of a 1MB block. The 2MB block could transfer more transactions per second, roughly double.
So the problem would *eventually* occur, but not exactly the same way or time.

There's lots of ways it could be destroyed - but all of them involve significant resources (besides the everyone gets bored and goes home one).
They're worth studying and understanding (block seizing, for example). Some have already happened or nearly happened to altcoins.

51% attack lets you control the chain or double spend - flooding the block size let’s you cripple the network itself.
A combination of getting 51% of mining + flooding the blocks would effectively kill a chain and not be insanely expensive fee-wise (as you’d get half the fees).

It could be a huge way to make even more money - sell some off to get whatever (cash, alt coins, blow, tether, monopoly money), then crash the price (no survivors) and then buy up tons of coins at the lower price.

If you have the coin, you talk to other coinholders - I'm sure the exchanges know who to connect you with (rumor is most of the actual bitcoin exchanges happen between whales on various exchange OTC boards).
And you pay a hefty fee - it bitcoins are trading at $15k you may sell your 1,700 for $14k or even less - but you're willing to do so because you get cash fast. Trying to dole them out on the market would take ages, or crash it.

The way to arbitrage this is to *NOT* have to move the coins - if you can identify that coin X is always higher on one exchange, but coin Y is higher on another, you buy and sell on the exchanges between the coins without moving coins.
The fact that it *hasn't* already been done when you notice it indicates something is preventing it.
[Arbitrage]( is normally done by huge banks/investment firms because it is programmable and risk-free. The fact it is *NOT* being done on these exchanges should be taken as a risk indicator - Mt Gox famously had bitcoin prices ABOVE other exchanges - just before it burst.

The SEC basically doesn't have to do much because so much of the enforcement is already programmed into the stock/commodity exchanges. The regulations prohibit things like spoofing, and the exchanges track spoofing and cancel orders that would trigger it, and ban those who do it.
It can still be done, perhaps, by using lots of shell accounts, but those also get tracked and caught. Lots of fancy math goes into this stuff.

I think you can find a reasonable upper bound for bitcoin by calculating the cost of *personally* executing a 51% attack - if bitcoin is worth significantly more than that, it will be done.
