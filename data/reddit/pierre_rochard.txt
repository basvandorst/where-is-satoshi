Reread what I said, you clearly didn't understand it. I'm arguing that the price is fundamentally unrelated with what the block size limit is. I'm arguing that moon landing can/will happen whether 99% of transactions are on the blockchain or 99% are off the blockchain.

It's not a question of should or should not. Bitcoin's day-to-day trading value is random, people just overlay their personal patterns and expectations on top of it. Bitcoin's medium term value is a linear relationship with time due to the Lindy Effect (  ). Bitcoin's "happening" "moon landing" value is exponential due to Thier's Law (good money drives out bad).
In no way is the price remotely related the block size limit.

Get a degree in Managing Information Systems from an accredited university. 
Focus on taking accounting, database, and programming classes. Put in 110% on the classwork and on your own time think about how to apply the concepts you're learning to Bitcoin. Write a blog with this material.

Haha, well, still waiting for your highness to refute anything I've written in a coherent manner.
