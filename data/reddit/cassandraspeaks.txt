That's less than 100% incentive you would have had before Bitcoins were treated as an asset, making the opportunity cost of assuming the risk of, and spending time doing, day trading relatively greater.  Most people, I'm assuming, would also much prefer selling at the long-term capital gains rate of 15-20% + state LTCG tax (which requires holding the asset for more than a year) instead of the income tax rate of up to 39.6% + state income tax.  And, it's simply easier for people to pay taxes on their Bitcoin holdings as infrequently as possible to prevent banks from closing their accounts and the IRS from auditing them.

A fractional reserve is where customer accounts are used to finance loans, i.e. assets. When money is taken or stolen from customer accounts and is simply missing, it's not a fractional reserve, it's a Ponzi scheme.

Only if it serves frappuccinos.

Yeah, but as stupid as that law is, I don't really want to risk decades in prison for tax evasion/money laundering.

Why bother even buying them when they could just take them?

Don't you have to pay the capital gains every time you sell and then rebuy it now?  Kinda removes a lot of incentive to do that.

Yeah, it could easily have been an inside job by someone who had Mt. Gox's source code and identified a gaping vulnerability.

Or, on a more mainstream level, it just branched out into funk and New Wave/synthpop.

Sorry, couldn't read your comment because I'm riding my iScoot right now.

I know, but it's still a tax on day trading, so it will still discourage it relative to the way it would be if Bitcoins were treated as currency instead of as an asset.  It's econ 101 (which I'm not implying you're not familiar with).

But other exchanges do not make it so difficult to withdraw.  Also, if they aren't pocketing anything, why would they have a cap on withdrawal amounts?

Might it perhaps, then, behoove them to have their bank be in a different location, seeing as ~99% of their customers are outside of Japan?  It's a rather convenient cover story.

Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying in the OP actually.  It's especially concerning because it used to be that you could withdraw BTC instantly.  I'm not sure why I'm getting downvoted; I think people just don't want to listen to what they don't want to hear.
