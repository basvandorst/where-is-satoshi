look up the address on a blockchain.info

lmao. I can't understand the altcoin craze. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:51:32
realize how unfree we actually were.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:36:55
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:03:50
I'm not sure if you know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:08:48
lol.

Miners get rewarded in two ways. The block reward will be a lot smaller yes, but transaction fees are also rewarded to miners. I think transaction fee's are actually on pace to be a greater reward very soon. I'm not sure on the exact timeline, but fee's will be the incentive for miners to uphold the network.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:33:14
What does this mean?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:38:23
There is a maximum.

Can you link me the intermediary protocol? This is the first I've heard of this.

Why do you think inflation is needed for a currency to be successful? I would argue the burden of proof is on proponents of inflation.

When a coin doesn't explicitly lay out how it's different or innovative compared to bitcoin I immediately disregard. buzzwords and hype are easy.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:47:21
is that hard to do? I'm to the moon or bust

Princeton has a free book online. Google Princeton bitcoin book. Also this is more technical but a good read as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:31:35
interesting. I'm not sure how many more halvening events until it's always the case. 1 or 2? it's at 12.5 right now.

lightning network is trustless. I'm too lazy to look through that site. Bitcoin cash claims to solve scaling by increasing the blocksize. I don't think an 8x increase solves much of anything. A short sighted solution to congestion. An 8x increase also makes it harder to run your own full node.

You're right, I'll recant what I said. Taking into account coins lost over time the price has no theoretical limit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:24:01
You have to link for me to care.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:46:29
I'm with you as well. It's hard not to be obsessed. There are so many people who are uninformed, so we are doing our part, however small, to inform and raise awareness.

1 bitcoin will be worth 100 trillion dollars each.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:59:05
buy after you educate yourself!

poor people are sad that bitcoin is now a game for the rich. This transition is a painful but necessary one. off chain scaling

Use twitter
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:29:35
agreed. I would really enjoy a 2 dollar bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:07:00
op really attempted the most minimal amount of research before posting this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:37:21
Also the people who are taking the risk investing in our generation are definitely the more technologically savvy and aware. I'd rather people who invested early have a greater share of the wealth. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:40:48
try calling the IRS. ahahahaha
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:26
bitcoin cash just got listed on the biggest exchange in america. Coinbase. Nothing else has changed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:39:32
I hope that happens, I would buy more. I don't really see people who understand how it works selling, most think that it's going to go a lot higher.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:09:28
If you don't believe 16k is a fair value then sell your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:11:44
It depends on your goals. My goal was to be in control of my coins in the cheapest way possible. Paper wallets are free and allow 100 % control.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:07:25
yo I need to buy coffee right now.
@_date: 2018-08-13 05:38:21
scoreboard. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:44:35
find the private key and move the coins
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:26:18
yes. Keep in mind bitcoin inflation is still at 4% per year if I'm recalling correctly. The real fun will be after a few more halvenings.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:57:15
you're paying for the network as well. BCH network is much smaller. Why not just make your own shitty altcoin and use that instead? It would be fast and cheap as well.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:14:44
transactions aren't a human right. We need laws to protect people. /s
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:12:17
the video in the comment you linked doesn't even work. Immutibility is a factor as well. Hard Forks change the rules of bitcoin. Who gets to change the rules? How often and when? Seems like corrupt politics. The chain that never breaks the rules seems more valuable.
