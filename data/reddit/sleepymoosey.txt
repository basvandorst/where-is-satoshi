When you have transferred to a paper wallet. How can you check the balance in a secure way without giving your private key and password to a app like for example copay? 
To OP, use bitadress.org to make a paper wallet. Watch a couple of YouTube videos about it first. BTC sessions show you how to send from Coinbase to paper wallet

Hope one of you can help me out. Im wondering how to check the balance on my paper wallet in a secure way, without giving away the private key?
I have bought some coins and I sent some of it to my paper wallet, to just see If it worked, before sending more. 
I have seen that i can sweep the paper wallet through Copay etc. But then I have to give the private key and password, which feels unsafe considering hackers etc. 
My plan is to move everything to a paper wallet and just store them there until I’ll sell them.

I see that I was a little unclear. Sorry. 
What I’m wondering is how I can check that the bits I transferred to my paper wallet actually is there / is received. Ex. So when you buy bitcoins from let’s say coinbase, and you want to transfer them to your paper wallet, how do you check that they actually are received in the paper wallet?
On YouTube I have seen that you can do this by login in on the paper wallet in ex. Copay and there you also can sweep the wallet. But then I have to give the private key so that feels unsafe.
I understand that I can find the value of my amount by converting it on google.

Thanks for answering! Really appreciate it. Do you have an app to recommend for checking the balance on a paper wallet, without giving up the private key? Doesn’t have my code with me so can’t test if the coinbase app can do it. 
I have looked at ledger and Trevor. They look nice but until I get one, I want to move my coins from the coinbase account to a cold wallet.
