Does anyone else see the parallels between this debate and the heated OP_RETURN debate?
Counterparty, at the time the biggest proponents of increasing OP_RETURN quietly advocated for unrestricted OP_RETURN limits. Publicly, they cried foul at 40 byte OP_RETURN and loudly demanded 80 byte OP_RETURN with popular support.
But the Counterparty devs gave and continue to give no assurance whatsoever for being truly satisfied at 80 bytes. And there is absolutely no reason to think they *are* satisfied at 80. It's like oxygen to them. Just like there's absolutely no reason to think 20MB proponents are truly satisfied at 20, because to most of *those* proponents the block size is *oxygen*. And now that we have NASDAQ and Overstock using OP_RETURN, what makes you think these big name companies won't attract more popular support for increasing OP_RETURN?
The bigger the blocks, the less fee pressure there is. The less fee pressure, the cheaper it is for users to stuff arbitrary data into blocks rather than OP_RETURN. This creates more incentive to increase OP_RETURN further and further, endlessly. Anything to keep arbitrary data out of the UTXO tree.
The fee market is supposed to stop that from becoming an issue, and if growing pains are what it takes to develop a fee market, even if slowly, then so be it. The alternative is a growing OP_RETURN, and if not, then OP_RETURN users will move back into the UTXO since there are no arbitrary limits on packing data into the UTXO and the UTXO is guaranteed to outlast OP_RETURN since it isn't subject to the whims of the core developers.
Is the future supposed to be an arbitrary block size, with arbitrary OP_RETURN? Is the future of Bitcoin feeless transactions full of UTXO spam largely to appease popular whim?
Then there's this gem:


I'm left utterly speechless at this. Even worse than the OP_RETURN or UTXO spam issue, in the absence of a fee market, clearly there exists no long term plan for mining incentives. This quote is from the lead developer of Electrum who evidently believes mining incentives to be more of an issue than the block size limit.
Without a fee market, we'll need artificial incentive solutions like industry funded surety bonds. The BitLicense forbids all regulated companies from working with unregistered or anonymous entities, hence surety bonds would be the end of anonymous mining. Register your company with MIT or the Bitcoin Foundation to receive a mining subsidy.
That, or we'll just have to remove the supply cap of BTC and raise it beyond 21,000,000 over the long term to keep paying miners.
This is what the future of Bitcoin is? Really?
We might as well just remove the hard limit. There's no use in delaying this any further.

Thomas should comment directly on the performance characteristics of Electrum server then. It is objectively speaking awful at 1MB blocks, and you should verify what I am saying.
The server is in need of serious upgrades, but it isn't clear what is even achievable in this respect seeing as Libbitcoin server, it being rearchitected in C++ by a ZeroMQ core contributor is also *highly* disappointing in its performance characteristics.

It's highly notable that Bitcoin Core has no good software engineering principles behind its reliance on mempool for storing unconfirmed transactions:




I stopped listening here:


The block size debate is about the future of Bitcoin scalability. This means **the future of SPV**.
Hearn is incessantly conflating SPV with bloom filtering, and it's got to stop.
The future of SPV is most definitely NOT bloom filtering, in fact, this is true because of the existence of Electrum SSL and to a lesser extent VerSum and other promising future scalability trends. No company or Bitcoin user would choose non-SSL connections or non-VerSum SPV connections if given a choice. Non-SSL connections are strictly an inferior subset of the more private and secure SSL connections Electrum, as a general SPV model, can and does provide. These technologies have a harsh truth to them, however: they require a federated network of servers running on modern, performant server class hardware, these servers must be known in advance to allow for certificate checking and cross-server SPV verification.
With this in mind, I insist everyone run Electrum server who can do so.
**No debate over Bitcoin scalability is complete without discussing the future SPV, and Electrum is a major part of that.**
Electrum server can *barely* keep up with 1MB blocks on anything other than top end hardware, as has been my experience. Talking about increasing block size by an order of magnitude, even if strictly needed to keep all user transactions on chain, would severely harm Electrum, by demolishing its federated network which currently is comprised of less than 100 servers in total.
Bloom filtering SPV as per BitcoinJ is not a silver bullet. **This debate is BitcoinJ vs. Electrum**. And if you would merely run Electrum server I guarantee you will see increasing block size harms Electrum SPV to the benefit of BitcoinJ SPV. That's the reality.
BitcoinJ is not a silver bullet.
It is really quite difficult at 1MB blocks just to maintain Electrum server, which makes it all the more frustrating to witness the accusations flying when I bring this up. It's even to the point where my posts on Reddit have become censored, which is *highly* concerning.
*Just run Electrum server*. That's all you have to do. Don't let me tell you 1MB blocks are difficult for the server to manage. Do it yourself.
Check the facts: run [Electrum server]( today. Should you refuse, this debate is *over and done*. If you think BitcoinJ is the scalability silver bullet, then we'll have to agree to disagree. Best of luck with the Bitcoin-XT fork.
