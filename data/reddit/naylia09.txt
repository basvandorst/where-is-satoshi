He actually bought into Apple at 90 just before it climbed to 170s....when Carl Icahn dumped his shares because there was no room for growth....but yes he bought Apple when it was established and he thought it was on sale, not in the late 90s. He’s a value investor. There’s nothing wrong with waiting for assets that yield dividends to be on sale and then scooping them up.  Crypto wil not improve his quarterly cash flow buy HODLing it. Buffet is a giant HODLer. He just wants his investments to generate dividends while he HODLs

Also they FDIC USD they are holding and they insure your coins. If you are going to have your coins on an exchange Coinbase is one of the better options. Just make sure to transfer to the GDAX side before transferring out to another wallet (GDAX covers the fee)

Someone has to actually deliver on the futures contracts at its delivery day which will involve a transfer of ownership of BTC at that future date...it’s a bet on the price but it’s executed by buying/selling the underlying asset to fulfill the contract
I remember an interview on NPR with a commodities speculators who didn’t unload his pork futures contract before its delivery date to someone who actually wanted pork and then received a phone call asking where he wanted his 40 hogs dropped off....

Your price is locked in at purchase time when you buy from a bank account in Coinbase. You should easily be able to view your pending purchase.

The Canary Foundation 
The Canary Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to discovering highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of early stage cancer and building tests for these markers. The goal is to identify cancer through a simple blood test, isolate the disease through medical imaging scans and then to intervene early enough to dramatically increase the chance of a full recovery with minimal side effects.

If you decide to move it, create a GDAX account (its linked to your Coinbase account) and move the funds into it. This transfer is free. From GDAX you can then move to a personal wallet much cheaper/maybe free

That's annoying. ~~Can you go back to the fork date and still work from that cost basis as the grant date? Technically the coins are yours on that date and when a particular exchange updates it software to allow withdrawals shouldn't really matter.~~
What date is Coinbase showing for transaction history? ~~That is going to be the best record for tax records. If they are showing yesterday, then yeah probably f'd.~~
Edit - nvm...just actually read the article and Coinbase users are clearly fucked by the "clearly realized" portion of the tax law...

If it is, they are putting a ton of effort in $1000, $500, $50, even $20 buys. It’s really interesting to watch the gdax charts and order history when someone puts up a 100 BTC sell order and it gets chipped away at by all these .05 buys.

People are focused on GDAX today because of the sudden influx of BCH into wallets on coinbase (free transfer to GDAX for trading). It's interesting to see what sudden supply can do to a market. There's certainly opportunity to arbitrage the exchanges when things go haywire.
Regarding your other questions, this sub-reddit doesn't spend much time discussing other cryptocurrencies.
I actually think all of this is extremely interesting from a pure science standpoint...what happens when the government is hands off a market....

I love the soft limits at 7% and 13% where everyone essentially gets 2 minutes to catch their breath so they don't stroke out....
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:15:32
15% is only for the middle tax brackets. Higher income tax brackets trigger a bump in long term capital gains to 20%. The 3.8% mentioned is an extra tax on people with high incomes: "Medicare Tax on Investment Income. 3.8% over $200k/$250k". The 9% is an estimate of what some states my charge at the state level. So yes, travwill is spot on.

I agree with daddyneedsmoolah. I probably wouldn't sell your crypto to diversify, but maybe hold that while starting to diversify your future savings. A couple things to check:
- maximize company match in a 401k if available to you
- consider contributing beyond that if you can to shield the income from taxes, $175k should have you in a high bracket, but not the highest so I'd probably go straight 401k/IRA 
- investigate intelligent portfolios with tax loss harvesting if you don't want to be too hands on with stock choices
- give it 5 years and maybe you can start thinking income properties if that's of interest to you as a method to diversify as well
- in general buy assets and hodl them all, hodl that crypto, hodl that real estate, hodl that sp500

Cashing out to dollars to cover tax liability is exactly what is done when you vest large chunks of stock at a company. Similar issue, you need to make sure that you have enough of the currency the tax is paid in on hand come tax bill time. Many people get themselves in trouble by not setting aside $$ for taxes when they sell land, stock, crypto, accrue gambling winnings. Remember if you suddenly have more $$$...the govt is likely going to want their piece of the action and you should understand the tax consequences or check in with a tax accountant.
