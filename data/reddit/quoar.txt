I spend my life between the UK and France/Italy, having to juggle with these two currencies is a mess. If I could buy food/train/bus tickets and pay taxis in BTC it would make my life so much easier.
Not mentioning the dozen of non-Euro countries I have visited those past few years.

As a person who lives and works in a € country but spends a lot of time in the UK, I am really looking forward to the day I can use BTC as easily as I use Visa. I am sick of paying for payment, withdrawal, and that it costs £5 for my girlfriend to transfer money to my € bank accounts while it costs €0.5 for me to transfer from Italy to France.

It's a different mechanism, but still a case of people buying stuff while the price will predictably go down.

I'll take a look at that, thanks!
I'm still looking forward to the day when sending money will be like sending an email though.

Maybe. But I was happy when I jumped from the population slice that doesn't income taxes to the one that does.
I know a lot of people who are into Bitcoin are also people who consider taxes are theft and some of them secretely hope a Bitcoin-based economy would make them totally out of reach from states. But I'm not one of those people.

I have read about using the proof-of-work and timestamps provided by the BTC protocol as a contract for wider purposes. Although I understand the idea of anything being validated in the blockchain of being *trustworthy*, I can't come up with real-life cases using it. Do you know more than me about it?

In many fields of science you make a "selection bias" sanity check. What matters is not only the size of your sample, but how it was built.
Knowing that 96% of the polled didn't answer the poll is relevant. A random 4% sampling would probably be representative, but in this case it is not.
Anyone here claiming that 51% of those who didn't answer are probably in favour of being paid in BTC is dishonest.
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:07:07
At the risk of emitting an unpopular opinion: if Bitcoin ever hits $100,000 I'd be happy to pay my share. That would be fucking amazing!
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:57:59
Not trying to circlejerk here, but I think *this* is going to be a game changer.
Not many brick and mortar businesses accept it yet but the main issue was how hard it is to obtain BTC. I think this is a mile stone.
@_date: 2014-01-20 13:02:41
Is $400,000 that much? Silicon Valley investors probably invest similar amounts in things that don't necessarily boom. I don't know, just a thought. It is a good sign, but not necessarily a proof.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:02:54
Thank you for your enlightening answer.
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:17:12
As long that your business doesn't run on BTC (a majority of customers pay in $, you pay your providers in $ etc) I don't think a fixed amount of BTC makes sense anyway.
@_date: 2014-01-15 11:13:32
I don't know who is speaking right now (11:08 GMT).
He is saying that BTC is changing for the "tulip-like" mania to something with a real transactional value, and that if people start using it it should be regulated.
Grandval is getting mad at people using the word "tulip". Cool!
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:51:57
I was thinking of BTC as a great way of exchanging value through internet, and eventually in a few years a convenient everyday currency, but this may come much earlier thant I thought.
Seriously, I travel to the UK very often and I am tired of paying fees for VISA payments or cash withdrawals. If I could buy my train tickets, pay the taxi and buy food with BTC I would start using them instead of exchanging for £ each time.
When I see the progress made since just last October, I start dreaming of it happening before 2015!

To avoid this unwanted effect, I now suggest that we only use negative questions in titles:
"Risk that BTC is not going to go mainstream?"

Since I know nothing about this, I will ask: why is it that so many people think inflation is necessary?

To me it will change when I can easily "top up" my BTC wallet. Now it takes too long, but if I could convert fiat to BTC as easily as I get cash at an ATM (or almost) then I wouldl really play along.
When that happens (in year?) I also expect the price to be high enough so that buying a pizza is not a significant fraction of my investment (it is already not). I don't fix myself a price limit.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:03:38
From what I have looked up, the Google searches correlate "exactly" with the price of BTC. But now you mention that I suspect there is a delay.
For a second I just felt super intelligent and thought of predicting markets through Google searches. Yeah, clever, I am probably the first person ever to think of that in 2000 years.

Having been only recently introduced to a certain number of concepts in economics, I am happy to read something about economics and not just the usual thing about why BTC is bad or why BTC is perfect.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:30:03


It is the purpose of BTC as well. Except that since BTC does not replace anything (like Euros replaced a lot of national currencies) it will take a while for it to find its pace and market.
I don't thin any of the current Bitcoiners would disagree with you on the volatility. But it is not inherent to BTC, it is something that will most likely disappear. Sure, all the current owners of BTC are keeping some of them in a jar because they think it can potentially be worth a lot more in a few years, but in a matter of months if a lot of businesses accept BTC and if the prices kind of stabilise (at least stop booming like in November that will probably never happen again) then BTC will start circulating. It is a very plausible scenario.
A lot the critics against BTC are critics against the current state of things, not really against the actual potential. **The problem is getting from "geek collecting shiny strings of code" to "a protocol that makes many people's life more convenient"**. Obviously many people bet on the fact that it will take off and their buying power in BTC will be much more than the quantity of USD/EUR they cashed in at first. That causes huge fluctuations, but it is not a flaw in the design, it is I think a natural consequence of the potential of that thing.
If tomorrow it becomes possible to buy your gas or lunch with BTC, a lot of those who own BTC will start trading them directly for goods. Why cash out $50 to buy gas if you can do it directly with 50mBTC? You became a millionaire with your BTC and want to buy a house? You can buy it directly with BTC...

This should change before 2015. I really think that in 2014 we'll see a lot of new things. I like your description of an open platform, it makes things so flexible that I'm looking forward to the stuff some people will set up.
I wonder if some other alternative currencies will be created, but building the infrastructure and trust is a colossal work (we can see it right now) so I am pretty confident Bitcoin will last, whatever it will be used for.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:18:29

What was the total amount of money in there then? Were there as many potentially life changing selling decisions as today?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:14:12
Or immediately, or they keep them in the long run, but chose the example of a retailer selling a computer for 1 BTC, and cashing out a few hours later when the BTC has lost 30% of its value. He said it is a disaster for Bitcoin, I was explaining why I disagree.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:49:14
He said that if the dollar disappears, the alternative currency that will be most popular will be remembered as the one that killed the dollar. He said BTC "might be one of them".

I really don't understand who could use that. In the current state of things, if you are competent enough to use this product you are certainly competent enough to make it yourself.
If you understand enough how to use it, you understand the risk of using it.
Even if this was for free I don't understand who would use it.

Bitstamp accepted my photo of a document issued by my city council. This + my passport made the trick.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:31:37
Just to say I went through the exact same steps as you, decided to start buying when it was around $500, and for other reasons haven't been able to buy yet (probably very soon). I have a street address and got a document from my city council, so my situation is easier than yours.
To me the fundamental problem of Bitcoin at the moment is the difficult access for most people, and virtually impossible access for a lot. Converting your local currency to BTC can prove very hard, and since the prices play so much in favour of early adopters, the great trans-border trans-national mission of BTC risks to fail...

I still don't get this. Who would spend $4 on a sandwich if instead they could buy 0.004 BTC that will be worth 40$ in a year?

You will need USD, EUR, GBP to pay your taxes probably.

I don't know the real terms, but its price now is driven by the hype and the (hypothetical) speculative value, rather than the fact that it is a convenient currency.
I have no idea how to price it, but the fact that it is more currently accepted and the faith in its potential future stability give it value. Between Nov 1st and Dec 1st, the situation didn't change that much, not enough to justify the price to go up by 400%. I cannot say if a price is reasonable, but if the price goes up by a large factor while nothing but speculation justifies its value to increase, then you are clearly in a bubble phase and it risks collapsing.
That's what you see around Nov 18, the prices went stupid, no one trusted this sudden increase in value so they decided to sell, then we got back exactly on the trend.
I think the question to ask is: **is the price mainly driven by people who want to make short-time profit (and will panic sell, bursting the bubble) or is it due to people willing to leave money in it for a long time, reinforcing the whole system**? If you see a sudden increase because a large company has decided to pay salaries in BTC, maybe then you can trust it. If you see a sudden increase because of a series of articles talking about a sudden increase, it may not last long...

Be sure that loads and loads are in the same situation. I took my decision to buy BTC one month ago, and because of papers and verification processes I wasn't able to do it until this morning. Maybe that sucks, but that's the way it is. You can't consider money you didn't make as money you lost. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:15:41
Exactly what I am thinking right now. Been waiting for my profile to be verified on Bitstamp, I would have loved to buy last week, now I don't know anymore.

He is saying that the Bitcoin protocol has the potential to carry much more traffic than it currently does. I agree with that, if it gets easier for the random Joe to buy BTC (it is not at all the case today) and mostly if it gets easier to spend BTC (at McDonald's, to buy train tickets, whatever).
If don't get YOUR point at all. I don't even know if we agree or disagree. If you wrote real sentences maybe I would.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:55:24
If you are a retailer that has recently decided to allow payments in BTC but instantly convert those to USD, then maybe you should not accept BTC after all. We are in the phase of early Bitcoin, if you accept payments in BTC because you bet on the price having gone up by the time you cash out, you must be ready for mini crashes like that.

...the point is: "and 7000 is still tiny, if Bitcoin was to replace only a fraction of another system, like, for instance, you know, it's not forbidden to talk about it, PayPal, yes, ok, I said it, all right, then it would be more than 7000 next year".
