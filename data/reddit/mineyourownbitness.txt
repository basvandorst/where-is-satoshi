I care- and probably people trying to log in to the site do also. Maybe even *anyone* that has a vested interest in Bitcoin.
I'm just getting into Bitcoin and can only afford very little. I bought one at around 150 and spent at least half of it already buying goods to help add my little part to the bitconomy, I was just waiting for the price to drop so I can make the most of what little cash I've put aside, so I can get more BTC to spend. Is that wrong that I should expect the exchange should be stable, more so during these situations?
Do you have anything useful to add? If not sit back and quit being a dick.

Barely working for me- 15 minutes after the big rush &gt;.&lt; 
I can log in now but takes several minutes to load any page - almost useless with something so time sensitive.

Is there a support email? I could not locate one on the site. I got the Captcha incorrect on the first try, and each subsequent attempt says my activation code is expired.

Yea the lag is quite shitty. I'm not even tryin to sell, I just want to buy low so I can get more bit for my buck.

What exactly was updated? Am I missing something? I joined CBX about a week ago and I don't see any update...

Aaaaaand, it's down again. Ugh. Why does it have to fail at the most critical times?
