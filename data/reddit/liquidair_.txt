They come from different compromised email accounts from all over the world. You can see the source and IP (the source isn't the "hacker" rather the compromised machine) if you view the full email source.
These jerks are making money though :(

My first guess is bots. What do you think?
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:29:22
True that. I wonder if they detected malicious trading. Is that a thing?

They serve as a historical record for technical analysis. Yes, you can switch to different aggregated lengths of time but this aids in making a better or educated guess on where the market is going. You can't solely rely on wicks since it can and will change without notice.
Interestingly for me was seeing technical analysis of Bitcoin and how accurate they can be as far as knowing the trend will change and that support areas, previous bottoms from past years, all served as indicators. These and many others are what veteran traders use to make informed buying and selling decisions.
Hopefully I understood your statement correctly.

Ahh, perhaps that's considered volume.  During any period a certain amount of positive vs negative volume occurs. I've seen some technical analysts state that if a high amount of volume occurs at a resistance level but then falls to red that reinforces that resistance point.
I don't recall seeing TA on the length. I agree that doing some kind of analysis of the wick length alone doesn't mean much beside the obvious more buyers or sellers existed within that period of time.

BNB drops 14% at times and recovers over time. Bitcoin will do the same.

I've received three of these emails.  They must have hacked an exchange or one is selling email data.
