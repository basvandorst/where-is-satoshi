Sorry I'm panicking
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:20:57
You have my condolences
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:52:17
Crush the price as in how an ETF denial would crush the price?
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:59:15
BTC is back. Back again

How do you determine whether they are cheap or not? Serious question
@_date: 2016-11-04 10:59:13
Sounds like a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:26:37
I'll take that trade off

Obama is a communist at heart.
@_date: 2017-04-06 09:27:13
What does this mean in layman's terms?
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:25:47
Can't wait to pay $100 transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-04-18 16:52:48
For maximum results we need to go deeper still. If you want to be on the cutting edge of blockchain you need to be investing in 4th to 5th layer start ups right now.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:55:03
Damn you sound like you are a visionary
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:39:51
2nd layer solutions will still require lots of space on the primary layer.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:42:02
that time has passed a long time ago
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:40:17
And? I didn't say I was against 2nd layer solutions. Because I am not.
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:11:20
Most likely explanation is that he's dead
@_date: 2017-04-18 10:27:46
I'll believe it when I see it
@_date: 2016-10-25 16:24:16
No, leaving power in the hands of the states instead of the federal government = decentralization.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:20:18
Nice man
I very rarely get that strong ‘you know it when you see it’ gut feeling but I’ve had it a couple times by now where I literally can’t sleep unless I act upon it and looking at the track record it has not failed me so far. Seems to happen very rarely though. Like less than once a year.
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:28:39
Past results are not a guaranteed predictor of future performance..
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:46:44
I believe the concept is also called decentralization
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:10:37
that's playing with fire my man
not saying it can't be done but the odds are heavily stacked against you which by definition makes it a bad choice for most people and the likelihood that you are an exception is doubtful, unless you have a multiyear consistent proven track record which hopefully includes bear and bull markets, both ranging and trending
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:26:20
How do these exchanges make money if they charge no fees?
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:43:35
no but it's definitely not out of the realm of possibilities 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:38:54
Right. That sounds like a good policy
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:16:05
Lol you only get that type of thinking in a bubble.. this confirms it
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:44:09


Well that’s hardly an issue is it
It’s buying bitcoin with borrowed money that is really problematic
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:30:26
let's not fret over minutiae 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:20:25
Yeah calling the market is a fool's game, but assessing the risks is not
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:12:22
if poloniex exit scams bitcoin price will halve at least, probably more than that
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:28:44
The centralized exchanges really are bitcoin's achilles heel. The nervosity is justified imo.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:30:37
I don't think you watched the video. They are in talks to propose a law.
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:43:45
You got it in reverse
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:30:41
How about a 80% correction tomorrow, you ready for that? It has happened multiple times in the past so this is not imaginary
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:39:05
I don't see why they couldn't make it illegal to buy and sell cryptos with fiat. That would permanently damage their potential
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:44:13
Cause it regularly goes through 80-90% drawdowns lol. If you put any leverage on that you’re done.
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:29:39
Can you specify what you are saying?
