I believe so.., this doesn’t mean that there won’t be places to buy SegWitBTC, we just have to wait till we get some more clarity.

Agree, the thing is 2x has no intention of changing their name which will create a lot of confusion since some exchanges which support 2x will call it BTC and other exchanges who doesn´t will call it BTC too. This is not good in the long run since it will confuse actual and new users.

I believe its because this exchanges, along with the other services and mining companies, were the ones that signed the NY Agreement, on behalf of what their costumers or all Bitcoin users want, supporting the 2X fork as a scaling solution. Although some of them dropped out, other are still commited.

I think we will just have to research on which exchanges trade the original one(SegWit), in fact, most of them must to comunicate their users which is their position(SegWit or SegWit2X). If this is not your case i recommend you to ask them or consider moving your BTC to a [desktop wallet]( like Electrum or Green Address where you will be in control of your private key and BTCs.
Here is some[usefull info and a list of the services]( that support the 2X fork.

Does Bip 91 Lock-in means that there is not going to be chain splt? As far as i know this does not guarantee that miners are going to signal for SegWit. Please someone who can help me with all this confusion..
