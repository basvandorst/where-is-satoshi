Yes, Bitcoin and other cryptos can be used for criminal activity, but isn't it the same case with fiat too...

Don't bother reporting it to the law enforcers. Seriously. They won't give a shit in this civil war. In fact they might be laughing at us.

This post is not new information. We already know that Roger is a "serial scammer" and "fraudster" who promotes a "shitcoin/scamcoin/altcoin" named "bcash"

PayPal is a currency now? wow

This is not a theory, this is a prediction.
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:56:54
In that case, fiat would already be crap
@_date: 2018-07-11 05:00:38
How did that happen? We are smarter than this

Yes, I know, I won't argue with that. But what I am saying is that this post is not new information. You could have created a new wiki page, and put there the reasons (including this post) why Roger is a fraudster and must not be trusted. I hope this suggestion doesn't end up like in r/btc.

Don't expect not to get banned. Remember after you get banned, post it in r/btc ;)
