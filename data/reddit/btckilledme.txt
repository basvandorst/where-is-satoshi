@_date: 2018-01-20 12:53:07
Of course it can become 0. Don't put in money you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:35:10

@_date: 2018-02-01 20:57:40
Why tf did u sell right now after bitcoin increased over 700 bucks in less than 30minutes
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:34:29
I can send 1000$ worth of LTC with just a 0.34$ fee. Are the fees higher when u send btc?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:58:13
