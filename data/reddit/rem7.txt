Done! It worked! I went to the ATM located inside the Sam's club in Santa Fe (Mexico city). As soon as you walk up to the ATM there is an option for "dinero movil". Select it. Then input the two codes I received by email. Cash came out.

Received my code to withdraw the cash from the ATM this morning. I will go pick up later. From the email I received sounds like this reddit post is generating quite a bit of transactions on their website. I'm not sure if they have their backend fully automated, looks like someone manually processed the transaction.

This is so awesome. I'm in Mexico at the moment telling all my family about bitcoin and how awesome it would be if there was an easy way for them to exchange bitcoins into pesos. I'm gonna have to test this out.

So, just sent myself 0.04321 BTC (Exchange Rate: 1 BTC = 4664.19 MXN) or, $14 USD, which came out to be $200 mexican pesos. ($202 including service fee). It's supposed to be available for pick up tomorrow at noon. I will report back.

People have to stop seeing bitcoin's main role as an investment/stock and see it for its true beauty. It's a currency. Use it to buy and sell stuff. Don't just buy bitcoins and hope to get rich by keeping them in your wallett. Use the true power of bitcoin and spend it. Send money, even better, send money to other countries. You can't even do that with his check analogy, try to cash in a foreign check in your bank and watch them laugh.

I use coinbase and haven't tried out circle. Are they less strict with identification?

I think the Mexican government can possibly crack down on BBV Bancomer. 
In the last two years Mexico went from an extremely US dollar friendly country, where dollars were accepted pretty much anywhere, to a country where the dollar is avoided at all costs by all businesses and people. American Express would even mail you your card statement in dollars so you could pay in dollars instead of pesos if you preferred. The Mexican government has very strictly forbidden the use of US dollars now, mainly because that's the currency used by the drug cartels. So moving dollars in Mexico has become extremely difficult. When you go to exchange houses or banks to exchange currency you now get IDed and copies of your IDs are stored for every transaction you make. You will get audited if the government feels you're exchanging to many dollars to pesos. 
I have a feeling that once the Mexican government figures out how BBV's services can be used to "exchange" money they will start regulating it very strictly or even have BBV stopping "dinero movil" service until some transparency can be established with the service.  The Mexican government will probably want to be able to identify which users are using the service. Maybe BBV will start requiring some sort of ID or to have a bank account with them. 
I live in the U.S. But most of family lives in Mexico and my sister lives in Europe. Moving money across countries is something we've always done and dealing with bank's ridiculous wireing fees, time delays, dollar issues etc, has always bugged me. I've always supported bitcoin for what it is, a currency without borders, I don't care much for making a quick buck as I ride the bubble. I want to be able to send my mother some money on a random Sunday (when banks don't even work) and bitcoin can help me with that. My only hope is that this gains some big traction in Mexico and people  start becoming aware of what bitcoin is. If that happens then I don't care if this website gets shut down because then the people in Mexico will be resourceful enough and come up with other ways to make Bitcoin work. There is a huge incentive for Bitcoin to work in Mexico. This well could be the begging of something.

Their windows 8 machine probably forced update with Windows 10 and picked up the old configuration that used to say they didn't accept bitcoin.

Going full bitcoin is just as stupid as going full fiat. Diversify.

I have completed everything including a purchaste and validated a CC and I don't have the 1 bitcoin instant buy :(
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:15:19
probably just as difficult as if someone who wanted to kill the US Dollar and started to buy all of them.

Welcome to the bitcoin community! 
I think the best analogy is if you think about it like real life gold mining... you know how during the gold rush people used to pick up gold from the river? it was that easy... eventually it got more difficult and they had to start digging for it... and now its gotten to the point where you need special machinery to mine for gold. 
Bitcoin was designed around the same principles. In the early days of bitcoin your machine was able to mine coins pretty easily... eventually it got harder and people started using GPUs... now its gotten so difficult that they buy special hardware specifically programmed to mine bitcoin. This hardware is expensive, and companies are taking too long to ship it, by the time they ship it its too late, difficulty keeps rising. So eventually people never make their money back, because they spent so much money on the hardware and they are paying for electricity costs, the amount of coins they will get back won't pay off their investment. It doesn't mean it won't make anything, it just won't make enough to cover the investment. So maybe using that money to buy bitcoin is better than buying hardware.
The hardware is also known to produce crazy amounts of heat since its so intensive... that's why I said "it'll be a nice heater" :)
Hope that helps.

Yeah, I haven't been able to withdrawal BTCs all day...

There are other altcoins, like peercoin that don't have a limit so there is a 1% inflation every year.

Can you explain what you mean by convert to hex to use as electrums seed?
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:25:35
in Norway you can use justcoin.com. I have an account with them but I've never used them. Just passing the info.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:54:12
When you import a private key, the proper way is to do a sweep. Meaning, you will transfer all the coins in that private key wallet to a new electrum wallet. That way you will have the coins with the seed.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:02:49
as far as I know, their API is down as well...

I started with coinbase but it was frustrating to wait so long to be verified and the stupid limits. I highly recommend localbitcoins.com that was a better experience it was fast and easy. I would recommend to bring a friend if you feel unsafe. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:32:34
I wouldn't be surprised if they assume a role where you have a BoA bitcoin wallet in your acct. And you could buy coins from them, assume the role of coinbase. I don't know, just thought.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:43:32
Did you just effectively lobby for bitcoin? Or did you bribe a US Senator :p
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:32:55
Also localbitcoins.com you can remain anonymous easily if that matters to you. Which is something you lose when using coinbase.

@_date: 2013-11-20 07:18:29
fair enough... just as difficult as if someone wanted to buy all the gold.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:04:21
Your analogy doesn't fit his example. His arguing you change the unit based on the context. 
- You don't say I bought a bag of chips for 200 cents. 
- You don't say I ran 0.01 of a kilometer. You say I ran 10 meters.

Awesome, not only is bitstamp is crippled but I can't withdrawal my bitcoins. They're trying to keep the volume there. Status says: "E-mail confirmation needed" and I haven't received anything from them. I'm only trying to withdrawal less than 10 coins... this is ridiculous.
