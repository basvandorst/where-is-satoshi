This makes us all look terrible. We need to focus on the tech and less on price.

That's a ripple effect I've never heard or considered before. Can you point out the knock on effects to back that up or was that a joke?

Posts like this are what make me think time travel exists but to avoid the effects of it, they aren't using it to kill Hitler they are using it to troll people with random things on the internet.

Literally the first one I made.

Thanks. I missed that blog post and will read it now. Take your time with Schnorr but it seemed like something that would be a priority for you once it is ready. 
Keep up the great work and I look forward to what is released over the coming years.
Only point of feedback though, I would love an easier education page on the website. There are links to Gitub, Medium, etc. but a "normal" features page and a "learn more" button would go a long way without having to search through updates and backtracking pull requests.
I know redesigning a website takes time and I'd rather have more features but it may get more people to try your product because it is effectively a download page with two paragraphs of information.

I expect sometime in 2019 we will see an official BIP for Schnorr and some working implementations. Once that is written, will you immediately begin supporting or will you wait until some other wallets start to use it and learn from their development findings?
