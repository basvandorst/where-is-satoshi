So why doesnt core wallet have segwit GUI again? Can the super talented and motivated brilliant team not sort that out?
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:07:53
Yes. On coinbase/gdax, your USD is insured at least. But your crypto is not.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:39:49
Are you implying that cypherpunks have a unified social agenda and political stance apart from a shared interest in privacy?
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:07:36
The coins will transfer... For a $40 or so fee. Will not get the lowered segwit fee, at least was my experience doing exactly that (nano segwit transfer to coinbase.)

Long term bitcoiners have also seen -70% loss in one day that doesn't climb back for three years. So there is that.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:38:31
By LN "working" what I mean is that it is functioning at scale. Even if some beta version of it exists, that doesn't mean it will "work" in terms of solving scalability. Segwit adoption is only 10% currently. There are other social and economic factors at play that will determine whether scalability is feasible besides the actual existence of the concept.  There will need to be good ux or adoption will simply not happen.

Inflation= value of your currency goes down.
Deflation= value of your currency goes up.
If you have negative currency (i.e. debt) you want the value of it to go down. Therefore, inflation encourages you to be in debt while deflation encourages hoarding. In an exchange economy, we want to encourage circulation of money through lending/borrowing. 
The stagnation of currency (hoarding) can lead to a deflationary spiral where the hoarding creates false scarcity of money supply, which makes the value go up more, which causes more scarcity, which leads to more hoarding, and around and around.
If the value of currency is constantly falling a little, it makes people treat the currency like a hot potato and invest or spend it rather than just let it sit there depreciating. Thus improving economic circulation.

But you will always physically need a nano to restore from, correct? What if you stick it in a drawer for 30 years only to find that USB standard has changed, the nano doesn't work anymore, nano has gone out of business a decade ago, etc.
Is the seed on its own enough to generate private keys some way that does not decay over time?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:18:37
It’s funny that at this point when people say “public adoption” it is implicitly understood that we mean the public buys into it as a speculative asset. I remember the days when we were trying to push “public adoption” of using it as currency.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:43:27
Have you seen videos of all the core guys? How do you not know that douches are not among them as well? If that is the basis you go by.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:02:28
Then I guess those are the more important traits.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:04:37
Except you can't buy instantly on gdax locking in current price. You can only transfer USD onto the exchange which appears to take about 7 days at which point the price will be who knows what. Probably high enough to cover the fee you would have paid buying on coinbase.

What about if you get hit by a bus suddenly and then your loved ones cannot inherit you BTC because no one can access them but you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:08:01
It’s not a simple answer. The answer is yes if LN works, and no if it doesn’t. Without it, we have no scalability. We don’t know if it will really work at scale yet. So all we have is faith in something promised.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:26:40
No, you are right. People will not pay it. Price is in free fall. What makes you think that's over? Can fall much deeper or even collapse as people are pissed off with these fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:13:40
Why is “problem” in quotes? High fees are a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:14:35
That's what the whole fucking point of this was supposed to be, and part of it's utility was fast cheap transactions, any amount, anywhere in the world. Now it's "nothing worth a lot is quick." Ok.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:18:59
Wait, but it can be stolen from you? Someone can just take it. Or does it not work without password? Do you like the nano? I'm considering one but makes me nervous if I stick it in a drawer for 30 years and it becomes worth a million dollars and by then it doesn't work anymore and the company is out of business and I can't get it off the thing.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:44:59
Yes, the passage of time is what established this as "normal." The first month after it passed $1000 would not have been the time to call that normal unless one can tell the future.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:29:31
You keep money on the exchange. This makes trades free and instant.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:49:51
No they have moved on to monero and other more functional alts. No one who actually uses it as currency will stick with these fees now that there are perfectly viable alternatives.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:14:38
Wait, if Amazon started accepting BTC what incentive would people have to use it? Currently I get rewards on the credit card I use, and I have buyer protection to reverse payments if I get scammed. Why would I want to send irreversible payment, basically same as mailing cash? For people interested in trustless systems, that puts a lot of trust in the seller. 
And don't say the intecentive to use it is to " promote btc" or "get the average Joe interested in it." That is circular logic.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:46:34
Cool post complaining about people complaining. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:57:43
Do you not find it alarming that 95% of BTC is held in just 4% of wallets? How decentralized is that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:10:11
Yes this is the reasonable response and sound logic. Which is exactly why I sold in the free fall, which turned out to apparently be the exact bottom of the dip. And as if on cue, the price started marching right back up the second I was shaken off. Bitcoin is an asshole. Price goes up for no reason even with $50 fees.
I’m hoping it’s a bull trap and the real bottom is around 8k where I wanted to jump back in with more. But then this rallying bullshit starts in.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:32:23
The problem with that as a long term strategy is that you are keeping your btc on an exchange. Basically, you don’t even have any btc if you do that. It belongs to them. All you have is a bank account with someone who you are trusting to cash you out if you ask. And to my knowledge, your btc is not insured on an exchange, only your usd. Sort of defeats the purpose of the whole thing to just hand it to some company to hold for you. Could have just stuck to Bank of America for that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:00:45
Has anyone who has read this tell me whether there is any good technical information in it? 
I am looking to take my understanding of bitcoin to the next level technically, and I’m looking for a good place to start. (Meaning I want to move beyond sweeping general idea of the concept of decentralization illustrated through analogies, and into what it actually is that’s happening.)
Is this book good for that? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:58:33
Some dude who recently dumped all his litecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:15:05
Sounds like a great way to get a ban. Rules or no, they are very ban happy around here.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:10:30
Because they would be the biggest stakeholder in it with a million coins.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:12:04
Cool, now move it again. Or at least check your wallet fees to move it again.
Gdax pays once while leaving and after that you have to pay. Like $30 or so.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:10:05
Or so they claim. I thought we were in a trustless system here? Why put your faith in something until there is evidence of it working?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:14:04
Who cares? People who have bought very recently. These people care.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:47:22
Wait, I thought you don’t get access to your private keys with a hardware wallet and that is the whole point? You just have a seed to restore from but no private keys. It is confusing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:11:57
I have been verified on coinbase for years and gdax still required uploading license and webcam photo. Not sure what process you went through to avoid that.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:32:08
Price going back below 10k is getting back to normal. It has been there for years and only jumped up like this for one month.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:45:28
There is no need as coinbase to gdax to wherever you want is free because gdax will pay your fee for you.
Also coinbase does not support ripple yet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:27:06
So how often do you transact in BTC and how often do you see others doing so? I keep hearing about Japanese adoption but it is beyond me how that works with the current fees. People just  pay $20-$40 to transact, or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:03:23
Bitcoin is irreversible payment similar to online cash. Why would you prefer to send that over the internet to a stranger? If you get scammed you have no recourse. If I get scammed paying with visa through Amazon they will reverse payment.
The reason this questions will always get downvotes but no replies is because there is no good reply. No one acting in rational self interest would choose a payment method that leaves them more vulnerable to getting scammed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:59:18
I don't know that they were really "taught a lesson" about segwit yet considering less than 10% user adoption. It may very well be the users who were taught that lesson: soft forks can lead to weak participation and possible failure.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:25:19
How do they use it as a currency with $30+ tx fees?
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:40:11
Right, but I already have an account with coin base. I already jumped through the hoops of getting verified and giving them my bank details over a year ago. They still want to withhold funds for 6 business days. Once my other online banking accounts are set up, it's instant after that.
There is no way to make btc magically appear. Back in the days normal people could mine, you sort of could but that's all done now.
Now, you have to go through an exchange, or meet up with a stranger in person. Either way is laughably inefficient and requires trust. It negates the point of a trustless system when you need trust to buy into it.
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:13:13
It's true, it's not practical for regular use for most people now. 
I recently made my first actual Bitcoin purchase online. I've had about 1btc sitting on coin base for like a year that I forgot about, so when I saw a thing I wanted to buy online had a "buy with Bitcoin option" I thought I would try it. The site sent an invoice with a wallet address, I sent payment, done.
I thought "this is kind of cool after all, maybe I will buy more btc." So on coin base I go to buy a little more and it said "this will become available to spend in 6 business days." Then I thought, fuck this, I was right it's stupid and non functional. 
I can get anything in the world delivered to my door in 2 days through Amazon prime but I'm going to wait three times that long to top off a wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:26:36
I only ever use a credit card to reap rewards and to positively impact my credit score. I don't use them because I "don't have the money." I find it annoying when I can't use it. I could have gotten so much more rewards paying off my student loans with them but that isn't allowed either.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:34:29
I don't think you are understanding. Miners are the ones who make the decisions. When you say "we can just change the algorithm," who is "we?" Non-mining nodes cannot fork, and cannot even validate transactions. All Bitcoin decisions come down to miner consensus.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:04:46
For bitcoin protocol, “economic majority” is meaningless. Hash rate majority is what matters. Full nodes witness and verify transactions but do no validate in the sense of adding them to the blockchain. Only miners do this.

This argument is great if someone is already wealthy.  Otherwise, it only works if one's life ambitions are limited to working for someone else and to never stop renting. (All while depending on public transportation.) The rest of us need to borrow money, whether we are punished for it or not. Building a home, starting a business and buying a car are all prohibitively expensive for non-wealthy people after all. Which makes up the vast majority of us. 
So which should we punish? I say we should plan our economy around punishing the least amount of people who are acting in good faith. This means "punishing" savers by default. (Which really just means encouraging them to invest money rather than sit on it.) 
Most people who are young can beat inflation simply by maxing out their IRA contribution. If not, then it's because they are even more wealthy which is not a bad problem to have. These fortunate people can invest their surplus elsewhere to stay ahead of inflation with very low risk.
