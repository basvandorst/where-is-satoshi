If you want to build a GPU rig to mine then by all means go ahead but mine some alt coins, mining bitcoin with a GPU is useless.

My advice, buy bitcoin or ethereum even perhaps another coin and hold for at least 12 months.

Personally I hold bitcoin and ethereum but there are some interesting other coins. Search around, trading may be another option instead of mining, buy low sell high, you can make money but there is risk. If you are set on mining look at some of the cloud mining options or look into mining alt coins with GPU's but I wouldn't bother buying your own hardware for mining bitcoin.

Free power is good, how much can you spend on mining rigs?

He means if you were mining years ago you would be worth millions but now it's hard to compete to make the dollars.

You can mine them if you want, it wouldn't be my choice but it is up to you. I would advise against it.

By the time you make back money for the machines and the immense power you need to keep adding as difficulty increases it ends up a losing battle or a barely profitable battle unless you have tens of thousands to spend on gear and free electricity so buying and holding ends up better.
As someone else mentioned if you really want to mine, look at mining alt coins.
If you were mining years ago when less people were doing it and difficulty was much lower you could have bought heaps of gpu's and made a mint, now companies spend millions on mining so unless you can also it will not be worth it in the long run.

If power is free and you want really to mine then asics but as has been the way for years now, buy &amp; hold = profit
