Do not ever ever ever speak to law enforcement.  You do not know if you don't have anything to hide.  They are not on your side, they are on the government's side.  IRS CI I'd paid to put people in jail for crimes against the US Dollar.
If you absolutely feel compelled to speak with him., Do it through an attorney ONLY.  An attorney will call the Asst. US attorney and get the real story of what's going on.  You may not be a target now, but that can change over night.  Get a lawyer involved now, or you may be eating your words in court.
Never ever speak to LE.
