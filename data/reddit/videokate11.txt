For example? Good food? No. Health? No. Nice material things e.g. nice house, nice car etc.? No. Love&amp;Wife&amp;Kids absolutely not free. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:08:48
yup "at least" are the magic words
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:36:25
im not an expert or anything but as a long time hodler usually if bitc drops simultaneously with ltc, eth and xmr then it pretty safe to say it will go up again 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:14:03
Where is it possible to see the warning? (If there will be any obv. Lol)
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:41:23
 shows the current unconfirmed transactions and bitcoins price is based on transactions soo
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:15:29
expected btc lightning network 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:13:21

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:07:40

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:03
those walls at gdax rn though 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:11:50
Who else watches gdax all day and checks for new comments after every significant change
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:18:50
It still remains total speculation imho
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:26:33
Can you explain why though
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:24:29
Blockchain.info again started to have massive login problems for a lot of users incl. myself.. i read somewhere they got 500.000 new users in last few days maybe thats having an impact on btc price right now 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:40:28

Im searching exactly for something like this,most likely it doesnt exist because no one knows even close how the price will be
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:13:47
I am confusion
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:47:27
so you think all unconfirmed transactions are already taken into consideration for gdaxs current price?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:08:05

Damn thae best action movie in action movie history is going on on gdax right now, im.eating popcorn with adrenalin and serotonin
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:58:53
I dont know how to have one without reaching all of the above
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:55:03
there it is! Trading will be enabled on the BCH-USD order book at 11am PST. If significant volatility is observed, GDAX will pause trading.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:56:48
no one knows. btc could be 1-10million or somewhere around 1000$ by then no one knows 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:48:45
depends on how old you are right now. if you are 90 then i am pretty sure the averge investment of a user (~0.0000001btc) will be enough 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:33:37
I don't think so because to me it looks like bitcoin is in a downtrend right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:12:25
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:11:12
What a rollercoaster of emotions i just went trough!
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:52:06
i know right, one minute of silence for those who panik sold (i didnt, hodl all the way)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:32:56
Not really because the raises were higher then the last ones and the dips are lower but not a lot
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:38:12
oh i am talking about the dips on december-january from 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. The dip from 2017-2018 is a little bit harder but the raise was also higher
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:23:17
If you have 89€ in btc just leave so you already have 89€ invested? Why do you want to turn them into euro
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:50:39
ouh thats awesome
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:47:08
lmao thank you had a good laugh 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:45:13
nah, im only 99,999% confidend
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:48:55
RemindMe! 6 months
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:12:10
Yes but shouldnt the price be falling when there is a much higher sell than buy wall
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:25:52
Bitcoin my dear friend, can you make up your mind on which direction you will take a little quicker please?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:25:16
