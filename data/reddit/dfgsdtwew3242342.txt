The hashing wouldn't even be an issue if you were doing bitcoin manually.. assuming everyone was hashing manually the difficulty would be very very low.. transaction verification would be so much more work than finding a valid hash.

I think we should just admit that it can never be increased.. I don't have a problem with 'uncontentious hardforks' - the problem is that they will probably only ever happen if something so terrible happens that bitcoin is essentially dead anyway and it doesn't matter anymore. While bitcoin continues to function on the 1MB limit, I predict that the original 1MB limit will continue to exist.. sure you can start an altcoin and maybe try to usurp the bitcoin name, but I don't think it will work.. it will certainly be messy.. I realize this is terribly unsatisfying, but ultimately the inability to change bitcoin may be what makes it so valuable.

There aren't that many people selling BTC.. maybe a few hundred with most of the sales probably being by less than 50 individuals. 
If you made a list of accounts that a bank's customers have sent payments too and order them by the number of different bank customers that sent payments there you can probably find those sellers near the top of that list.. in addition lots of people put some localbitcoins transaction id in the memo field which is pretty easy to identify as such.. 
I don't know if that's how they do it, but really it'd be trivial to identify all the people buying bitcoins.
