I concur, it was a bit of an apples to oranges comparison. The point was though, regardless of the size of the user base there are many other factors that could burst this bubble, if in fact it is a bubble.

I do agree with this. The technology behind Bitcoin is fascinating and potentially very useful. I'm just genuinely questioning about those out there who are buying Bitcoin right now for the first time because of this hype, who feel they too can profit. The hype being created by current or early investors of Bitcoin, as long as it drives Bitcoin purchases, is of benefit to themselves and will potentially be of detriment to new investors. No?

Mind blown. The more I think about it the more I realize I couldn't imagine the impact of this in the real world setting.

Bravo to you. Take this upvote as consolation prize!

The housing market had a pretty sizable user base in 2007.

How does it "double" the profits? As a former business owner I admit transaction fees are high, but circumventing them entirely still wouldn't "double" gross margin.

Bitcoin is about a decentralized currency... and getting rich.

Fair, I will agree there is a potential benefit there. But although I am a supporter of Bitcoin, this is the biggest point of contention for me as a benefit. Bitcoin is too convoluted in it's current form to be viable as a widespread currency. Example: My mother can't easily go to the gas station and pay for her gasoline even if she had Bitcoins and even if they accepted Bitcoins, as easily as she can whip out her check card and swipe it through the reader. In order to create widespread adoption, to make it more appealing or considerable, for large retailers someone would have to streamline the transaction processes as banks currently do with credit and check cards. As every current Bitcoin exchange or transaction does, this would require the implementation of transaction fees, to not only cover the operating costs of the business - but to make money. (Not only that, but some transaction fees on certain Bitcoin exchange sites are currently higher than the transaction fees that certain credit and check cards charge?) So now we are back where we started. Transaction fees for currency exchanges. I don't see how Bitcoin could eliminate this.
