I was just trying to be helpful, so no one had to click buttons for a billion years :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:31:19
That is my hope/thought as well. 
Yeah I don't think I could handle it. I'm also currently in the non-profit sector so I don't have a whole lot of income, buying in on a semi-monthly basis with just a little bit of disposable income has gotten me into the 210 million club. That's a thing, right? lol

I'm not worried about it, I'm in btc and most of my other investments for the long haul (majority of my investments are tied up in my 401k and I'm no where near retirement lol) so I'm just riding it out. 
I believe also there was some noise about the Federal Reserve and interest rates, so that may be a factor as well. I don't play the market, I DCA with bitcoin, and as the years go on I move small percentages of my 401k from riskier investments to more stable ones. For me, there's just so much information and it's hard to know what is legit and what is just noise, so I feel like if I tried to really day trade or anything like that I'd end up totally broke lol

I don't really know what I'm talking about, but perhaps the whole market (stocks and crypto) is dipping ahead of 45's SOTU address, in case he says something incredibly stupid that has ramifications in financial markets? All of my investments seem to be down today.

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:57
I am by no means a financial professional. If your gut is telling you to wait, then wait. You're already hodling some, so that's good. (I also bought some this morning - threw in a limit order at $15250 and it ended up getting filled) No matter what you decide, only invest what you're willing to lose completely. It used to give me crazy anxiety when it dipped $500 or $1000, especially after I bought some, but if you zoom out that chart to 1 month, you'll feel way better. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:11
yeah, it's overloaded right now 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:05:42
Well, think of it this way. Price is ~$16k right now. You sit there with, say $1,000 waiting to buy during a dip. That would get you 0.0625 BTC right now, but it would get you 0.1 BTC at $10k. The futures market opens and there's no dip, and the price jumps up to $30k. That 0.0625 BTC that you could have bought at $16k is now worth $1875. (Of course, there might be dips along the way, and no one can predict the future, that's why I'm a fan of buying what I can on a weekly basis regardless of price, and having a little extra cash in reserve set for limit orders in case there is a dip. I'm up 1600% by this method, and I only started buying this year. YMMV of course)
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:03

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:05:17
well, duh, but why would I marry someone and not fuck them afterward? The only reason to lock it down is so I have access to sex anytime I want. I have no other reason to tie myself to someone

yes, they support it and are ready to implement, it just hasn't launched quite yet. Someone posted this link in another thread: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:45:37
They have a dynamic fee schedule, but if you're not a super high volume trader, it's .25% 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:25
we got it early lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:31:34
did you, because one of them has 55 BTC on it 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:40:27
At the top left where it says "Balance" click on the button that says DEPOSIT. In the window that opens, click the tab that says COINBASE ACCT source will be BTC wallet, transfer however much you want to GDAX.
Then back on the main page, click WITHDRAW and then BTC ADDRESS and send it to your hardware/paper wallet address.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:40
well when I woke up it was over 16k on GDAX, I was just jokingly guessing 20k by dinnertime. Last time I looked last night it was somewhere in the vicinity of 15k.
The price momentarily jumped over 19k on GDAX a short while ago, but it's back to 17k as of me typing this.

Hopefully Guy will have a LW&amp;T in place with instructions for the family/beneficiary. If not, then yeah, they would probably just sit wherever they are for eternity. If Guy's bitcoin was held on an exchange that had verified his identity, there is probably a way to get them back with a death certificate, etc, and I'm sure it would take FOREVER. 
Coins falling out of circulation increases scarcity and in turn, value, generally speaking, but I don't know that there would be any real effect until all 21M coins are mined. I could be very wrong about that, though. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:04:04
I mean... the price hasn't even dropped below yesterday's low yet so maybe just zoom out the chart and relax a lil' bit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:16:37
I did the same thing! haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:37:49
you're taking me way too seriously, but if I ever get married, I plan to have the same amount of sex after as I did before with the person I choose to marry. I am well aware that marriage is an emotional endeavor, but sex is an important part of a relationship, imho, and i don't foresee marriage changing that in my circumstance. I wouldn't marry someone who i wasn't sexually compatible with. I know that it becomes more difficult for those who decide to procreate because so much time and energy is spent on the children, but I won't be having any and neither will the person I marry (kids are a dealbreaker for me) so the act of marriage itself shouldn't hinder sex.
tl;dr: I was mostly joking and I guess I should have put an "/s" up there somewhere
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:17:12
well on the "status" page it says that BCH will remain in post-only mode until liquidity is established, so I'm sure they are hoping more people will be in a buying mood today to help even it out, and will not open for trading until it's at a reasonable price. (That's my logic talking, I hope like hell it skyrockets back up because they cancelled my sell order last night and I want the $$ that I thought I was gonna get, not 1/3 of it lol)
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:15
You should have it now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:05:27
No, you don't need a hardware wallet. Be aware (as everyone says here constantly) if you don't hodl your private keys you don't hodl your coin. I would suggest creating a paper wallet, buying on an exchange, and sending your coin to that wallet if you're not planning on spending it anytime soon. You could also use a software wallet if you didn't want to worry too much about keeping a physical paper wallet safe. (I'm somewhere between "I'm just testing this out" and "HARDCORE ENTHUSIAST" so I am utilizing paper wallets as they give me more of a sense of security than a software wallet. Someday when I actually have a decent amount of Bitcoin, I plan to get a hardware wallet)
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:59:35
Trezor, nano s, paper wallet. I'm personally using paper atm because I don't have current plans to sell or purchase anything with btc right now
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:24:36
this is what I do with GDAX. I don't buy on coinbase though unless I'm buying with a CC. Set a limit order, don't pay a fee, transfer to my wallet off the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:06:22
Agree, but because Satoshini sounds like some type of sushi to me. ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:51
Oh that's so lame, I'm sorry. I hope you're able to buy without any trouble from here on out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:13:32
I am of the opinion that it will continue to rise until futures trading gets in full swing. I have no idea what's gonna happen after that, but these last few weeks have been fucking bonkers! I wouldn't mind a correction, though, if only to grab coin at a discount :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:40:43
this is why I left limit buy orders sitting on my accounts. I almost cancelled them after the futures trading started because nothing really happened, but I figured I'd leave a few just in case another bch pump happened/coinbase gave everyone their bch. My limit buy orders were filled before I even knew I had access to bch, and now I'm just waiting to dump it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:18:55
there are people that have coin to sell and people who want to buy, when you put in a sell order at X price, the exchange finds someone who wants to buy coin at X price and they fill their order with your coin. (sometimes they fill multiple orders or partial orders just depends on how much your selling) That's the general gist, but you don't have to wait for someone to buy it from you directly. It works basically just how you bought it. I hope that made sense.
edit: a wise time to sell would depend on what you want, specifically. Once the coin you hold is worth a certain dollar amount, etc. I wouldn't try to time the market, and if you're not into hodling long term, make an agreement with yourself. "When BTC hits 30k I'm selling it all." Then put in a limit sell order for all your coin at the 30K price and wait.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:18:10
Well you'd sell it for USD and transfer it back into your bank account and whatever exchange rate your bank has will turn it into CAD, I would assume. You could also just find an exchange that deals in your currency of choice. I believe there's a list on bitcoin.org. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:02:38
LOL agreed, but sharing for anyone who might be in Albany or the surrounding area. :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:22:47
I've got limit orders in place in case there is some volatility over the coming weeks, and I just DCA every week otherwise. A little bit here and there (even when I bought during ATHs) and I'm up 1600% ROI. If you can afford it, I'd say buy now and buy more if you catch a dip. If not, just buy more anyway lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:50:25
Get set up on an exchange (Gemini, Coinbase/GDAX) and only invest what you are comfortable losing. Set up a paper wallet or hardware wallet, transfer your coin there (free on Gemini/GDAX) and let it sit. You can transfer whenever you buy, so your coin stays secure. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:56:41
&lt;3 and have an upvote. Glad I could make your day a little happier :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:12:50
If market price is what you want to sell at then yes, you can sell whenever. If you want to sell at a higher price, you can put in a limit sell order and hope the price swings up. You can't sell for 5k more than market price unless someone is willing to pay that much. I hope that made sense!
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:16
No, not really. I mean, there's a "hold" on the money until the order is filled so you can't use it, but you can cancel an order anytime if you need to. They just sit there waiting. 
I do think many people do this, but I think it can be intimidating to people who are new and aren't investors to begin with. I have never played the stock market or anything so I had to look up what it meant and make sure I was doing it right and I still didn't know for sure until it worked lol. The fees are usually lower/waived for limit buys as well. I've had a limit order in for like $8450 sitting there since Nov 25th. If you have the extra money you don't mind being tied up I think it's a good idea. It's just one of those decisions. You could buy now for 13k, or put in a limit order and get it at 10k, but if it never dips that low again you could've bought it at 13k and now it's 20k... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ That's why I have limit orders set and I usually also buy once per week regardless of the price. It's super easy to get caught up in the minutia but I believe it's going up in the long term so I don't get too worked up about it, I just buy and hodl. :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:01:34
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:03
You're welcome! Happy Hodling! :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:35:45
I wonder if it's on Gemini's end or Chase's? Either way I hope they figure it out quickly! I have accounts on both GDAX and Gemini right now, kind of as insurance. If one fucks up or crashes or something, then I can still trade on the other. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:28
already have a limit sell order in :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:03:57
This made me smile :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:22
Yes, but I think that might have been the remainder of the initial stash being moved when the wallet was swept.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:20
It should be in your account now. If you had bitcoin on coinbase at the time of the fork, they put the same amount of bch in your coinbase account, whether or not your bitcoin is elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:06:26

25850 pounds of Bananas = 1 BTC (based on market price of $12925.00 USD to BTC, and the average cost of bananas being ~$0.50/lb, according to google)
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:22:03
I think they verified me on the same day. My issue was the bank stuff, because my CU wasn't on their list, so I opened up an account with Ally and had to fund it in order to fund my Gemini account, so it took me a few days to get everything set up. I would contact them about it, but unfortunately with this influx of new people it might be a minute before they get back to you. I hope it works out for you! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:31
It's selling now, they said they had to wait until there was enough liquidity to open trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:52:23
as long as your cash back percentage is larger than the percentage in fees, that doesn't seem like a terrible idea. Granted even if it's not, you'll make that money back in like 15 minutes anyway lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:26:45
The accounts that have $$$ in them are usually listed first. BCH was on top for me, but it's because it had the most $ in it. All my BTC is stored safely off the exchanges, so it's last. (this is on the desktop version, I don't use an app on my phone)
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:05:33
I mean, it's really just: Current bitcoin price in USD/0.5 = so many bananas (in lbs)
or, for the rest of the world:
**BTC price (in x currency) / cost per kilo (in x currency) = kilos of bananas**
so for GBP: 9800/.6 = 16333 kilos of bananas (based on 60 pence as the going rate for a kg of nanners)
*I'm sorry for the way that I am*
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:39
That's a decision you have to make for yourself. People said there was going to be a huge correction at 10k and that didn't happen. You could buy in now and make sure you have some money available to buy again if there is a dip soon. Even if you go all in now, and there is a dip, just ride it out. I've bought a couple times and there has been a dip shortly thereafter, but within a week it was back up over what I bought in at. It also depends on what you want out of Bitcoin. Do you believe in the tech and do you plan to hodl? Buy anytime. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:37:37
Honestly between $10-25. I'm headed back to school starting in January (in my 30's) and I work in the non-profit sector, so I don't have a lot of disposable income at the moment, just getting what I can. It's not a lot but it adds up!
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:15:06
in my experience, my very tech friendly people aren't even into bitcoin. they are asking me to explain how it works to them and how to get it and what it's for, and every once in a while "I thought that was for drugs and shit??" 
My tech unfriendly people definitely don't have even the slightest clue at all what "a bitcoin" is.

all of this. I'm hoping I might be able to hit 0.1 BTC by the end of the year. I just keep buying a little at a time, and if I see a large dip (like today) throw a little extra at it. I'm way up, overall, it's just slow going. :)
