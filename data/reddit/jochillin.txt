Warning: excessive generalizations ahead!
You said the belief that human nature is bad is central to liberalism, I countered that it is much more central to conservatism.  For example liberals extol the virtues of public assistance on the assumption that people are good and will improve themselves given the chance, whereas conservatives see those same people as leeches, mooching off the government teat, taking advantage of the system.  Which view is more "human nature is bad"?
Religion comes into it because ones view of human nature is intertwined with ones religion.  It is a fact that the vast majority of conservatives are Christian, a religion that teaches all humans are flawed (bad) and must be saved, and many believe that morality requires religion - without it people are bad.
I'm not arguing whether the liberal or conservative view is correct, but that you are completely ass backwards when you say seeing human nature as bad is central to liberalism...  And yes, every generalization has outliers, there are religious liberals and atheist conservatives, but when you start a conversation with a massive generalization, don't be all surprised when it continues in generalizations...

Assuming we are talking the US, the vast majority of conservatives are religious, I don't understand how that is even a question...

Um, no?  It seems much more central to a conservatism, which needs a God to enforce morality.  But I think you're mixing up religion/politic/ethic/morality a bit.
