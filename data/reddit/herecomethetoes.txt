Maybe my understanding of Woz is wrong but i'm under the impression that he has never had any desire to be ultra rich. He's a geek and cares about technology. He became insanely rich from building awesome tech products which he seems to care deeply about

I've had no luck trying to sell my Phantom 3 via Facebook and thought this would be an interesting experiment
I don't really want the cash that much and the sale of the Phantom would've just gave me cash to buy Bitcoin with
Any body want to buy a Phantom 3 Advanced drone with a Bitcoin payment?
This is 100% legit and mostly an experiment for me as i've only ever bought Bitcoin itself and I have never received payment via Bitcoin

I've never met Woz so I haven't asked him "What do you think about money" but lots of books and articles quote him and he doesn't sound interested in being a rich man at all.

I've struggled to get my hands on an S9
I've seen lots being advertised for sale for £4000 at least but that's not the £2000 that Bitmain are selling them for and not a price that i'm willing to pay

News headline from 2030:
"Reddit user once bought sunglasses with Bitcoin which today is worth $1,000,000,000,000,000. That's nearly as bad as the guy who once bought 2 pizzas for £100,000,000,000"
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:19:32
The quicker you sell the better. The high price of the S9s can only hold out for so long before Bitmain release more / somebody releases a better ASCI
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:10:15
Haha, I like that
The stupid thing is that if you take a step back and think about the benefit of buying an S9 at £2000+ it's actual value, there is zero benefit. Yes you get to mine but mining that £2000 is going to take longer than waiting out the stock shortage or a new product that betters an S9

I've noticed CNBC have stopped calling BTC 'Bitcoin Core'. I guess Rodge has stopped paying them off
All in all history tells us that scams rarely work out for the scam artists. I have no doubt that in 1 years time that Bitcoin Cash will be as respected as BitConnect

It's seems fairly obvious that something's not quite right with BCH. 
 - Nobody seems to be using it yet it's promoted as being used all the time in - They rip off the Bitcoin brand
 - Roger and Craig as super strange people
 - Bitmain owns a large majority of BCH
 - - Who the hell rips off a ticker that's not even correct? :D
 - If you mention anything bad about BCH you get downvoted in (obviously people paid to down vote and comment)
It's overwhelming to me that BCH is a scam dressed up

I'm a software developer so i've always had exposure to new technologies. I remember hearing about Bitcoin around 2009 in the office and it was always something we joked about: "You should mine Bitcoin" and then we'd all snigger. None of us had any idea of the value it would increase to
Long story short, none of us mined Bitcoin. If we had, would've probably mined a lot. I can imagine the competition that would've arose in the office "I've got 500 more BTC than you"... "Oh, I better get mining some more then"
I'm sad that I never did mine Bitcoin when it was easy......

@_date: 2018-06-14 12:09:34


I think you're right on this
Applying logic to a dip, which many people don't seem to perform, you have you ask yourself if you were planning to sell at the time the dip occurred and if so, then yes, it sucks. 
If you're planning a long game, which many people are then a dip shouldn't affect you unless you believe the dip is the start of a crash to 0 and cryptocurrency being wiped out of existence, which we're all confident isn't the case, I hope
I guess overall, the panic sellers are the people that are making the game easy for the logical thinkers. Weak hands mean i'm getting A 50% off price sale, which i'm not complaining about. I just wish people were more reasonable and intelligent about the actions they take. Sometimes I feel like facepalming and asking "how can they be so gullible and stupid?"

I don't particularly want to speak about volume specifics. I have cleared a chunk of my savings account into crypto along with the majority of my income for 2018. I started investing in December 2017
If HSBC were kicking up a fuss I think I would've heard from them by now. If I did have my account suspended/closed it wouldn't affect me at all. I'd quite happily open an account elsewhere or even an internet based bank account and continue exactly as I am now. The only reason I bank with HSBC is because they came to my school 25 years ago and pretty much got us all to open an account with them. I've been with them since purely because it's easy. HSBC don't seem to offer anything that no other bank could offer

The internet happened. Pics or it didn't happen
And to your other first question - I read between the lines

You're right

Keep in mind 1 BTC can be denominated into 1 million pieces (sats (satoshis) )

I dare you to post this in :D
Not sure how Roger does it but he's brainwashed most of them to completely not see evidence and facts in front of their face. You could show them successful LN payments going through near instantly with low fees and they wont believe you.
I get it that LN threatens Bcash to the point where Bcash has no purpose and people may be heavily invested in Bcash but just don't be a mindless robot about it

Don't bother telling They wont believe you because Roger tells them it's not true

Everybody buy in so the whales can sell off and scare you all into selling so they can then buy back

You're naive
If you think the market is your friend then you're mistaken. The market wants to take what you have at a price lower than what you paid for it. That's *fundamentally* how *any* market works

Somebody selling a lot of BTC may also trigger bot trading
Once you cause a few people to sell off a lot then you get a chain reaction. It works the same way up and down the charts
Any market works this way, whether it's a market selling oil, sand, stock or bacon. Markets are based completely on human physiology and emotion
I'm not at all excited with the market movement in the past 72 hours. I don't believe it's anything other than a "bull trap". People are posting thoughts of rejoice as the market has moved up *slightly*. I've been watching the crypto market for over a year and i'm not falling for "the bear market being over". It goes down 30 billion as easy as it goes up

Classic Rodger. Scamming and bribing

I've never told family about my interest in it
If it goes well, you get sucked off
If it goes bad, you get mugged off

I wouldnt if I were you
Im planning to spend 10,000 GBP on Bitcoin before the end of the month so its going to drop like an anvil in one of those YT videos
