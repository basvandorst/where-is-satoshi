Maybe this is a dumb question. If it bitcoin is infinitely divisible why should the supply impact demand?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:24:12


I’m confused. If they are trying to decrease the money supply by selling of their assets, aren’t they INCREASING their money supply since they’re exchanging assets for money?? If inflation  is occurring the purchasing power of money goes down which means that the assets are more valuable. Do you have a background in economics?

All three of those points are easily refuted because they're each more nuanced than that twitter guy is letting on. 1) US Dollar is accepted as legal tender, taxes and debts as mentioned above. 2) This one isn't a strong argument to begin with except if bitcoin were completely anonymous. Its not, but its probably going that way at some point which would make it ideal for money laundering and organized crime. 3) "so short it then lul" is stupidest shit I've ever heard people say when ever someone expresses doubt on markets. Shorting is a matter of timing, if you try to short now and bitcoin collapses in 5 years you probably lost alot of money if it went up in the meantime. Take a look at herbalife and Ackman. Herbalife is 100% a ponzi scheme and ackman tried to short but eventually had to stop because he ran out of money. 
Whenever I see this kind of shit it reminds me just how mindless a mob really is. This post has 1281 upvotes and that drives mob mentally even further. It really makes you think twice about what other shit we take for granted due to our own minds getting swept up in the mob mentality.

@_date: 2019-03-07 15:46:34
It's funny how there's such a big discrepancy between the comments and the content that actually gets upvoted in this subreddit. It might just be an effect of the bear market but it seems that culty memes such as this one get upvoted on the main page but then more self-conscious/sobering comments get upvoted on the actual threads. Imo it points to two non-mutually exclusive possibilities: the bear market means that bulls are quite and sober comments get more traction from bears, or this subreddit is being astroturfed with culty memes in an effort to drive up price and increase sentiment and it's easier to spoof upvoting than getting bullshit comments upvoted in a bear market.

Forgive me if this is a stupid question but what is stopping the people who control and distribute Tether to "buy", thus "create" tether, and buy bitcoin with it and then turn around and sell the Bitcoin, thus keeping both their initial investment and the change pocketed from selling the Bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-11-09 12:45:35


Just curious how do you know what the fees will be? Is that predetermined? And I don't know exactly what you mean that miners can chose what transactions to include in their blocks? Is that to say they may reject a transaction if falls below a certain amount? 
Personally I'm still learning about Bitcoin as I go along. It astounds me that people, not meaning you here, they just take things for granted without trying to fully understand the complexities.

Personally, I don't know enough to offer anymore insight than is offered in the tweet but I was hoping that we had some more knowledgeable folks that could shed light. I would offer one caveat I'm noticing a change of tone towards BHC on this subreddit out of nowhere and I'm beginning to suspect it might be some sort of campaign to increase interest in BHC since the B2X cancellation. I'm not certain as I don't have evidence but I suspect brigaiding is occurring.

dude you sound awesome. Have you thought about forming a non-profit and making this an operation? A grass roots movement using bitcoin and a non profit to help feed Venezuelans would be a great thing and give more legitimacy to your operations that would incentive people to donate more.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:07:46
So, from what I gather from what your saying you simply can't just sell your B2X after the split? Its better to just hold both in case you don't unintentionally sell your Bitcoin as a byproduct? If true, its criminal.

If we assume its true that the current state of bitcoin does not support or have scalability currently to do menial transactions amongst the wide populace, how would that impact the use of bitcoin and the miners in the future? 
Bitcoin may have an issue with fees and speed when it comes to small transactions on a large global scale but it offers security on the other hand that might prove valuable for companies and institutions trying to move around large sums of money. My question is would this be enough to sustain miners through transaction fees alone once bitcoin is fully mined? 
The problem with bitcoin in my opinion is in the future if its no longer scalable to continue to use it transactionally and people adopt another lightening network crypto like Litecoin for coffee-buys then what does that do to the price of bitcoin and how does that impact the miners?  At the end of the day its the miners that are the most important part since they're the ones that are incentivized to keep the ledger going, if they don't have that incentive bitcoin will no longer hold that value. Can anyone with a deeper understanding address these issues?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:40:44
I'll have to disagree with you on that one. BTC's issues need to be addressed, for sure, but this isn't something that needs to be fixed immediately.

This is what gets me, that confidence in BTC should have grown since the S2X failure and yet here we are. Perhaps it would have been better for us to face the test of S2X instead we didn't get a chance. Something fishy seems a foot since nothing changed for this move to BCH to occur. Going to HODL BTC till the end of days.

Thanks for the great post. The great crash will happen as the built in price for bitcoin at the moment is largely speculative. Its just a matter of when. Don't put up any more than you're willing to lose. Any money invested in bitcoin should be considered "lost" so as to not kid yourself into thinking you *know* the market, because you don't, no matter how well you understand bitcoin. Even if you listen to the top experts like Andreas etc., Bitcoins future is far from assured. Here's to you "It is not the ship so much as the skillful sailing that assures the prosperous voyage."

I don't doubt regulators ability to creatively apply legislation to attack the anonymous currencies. I can't think of how but I wouldn't be surprised if they did it somehow, whether that just means simply making it illegal to own it or transact etc. Get in the way of Uncle Sam and his taxes and he'll bring down the hammer. Similarly to how degenerates who operate in the dark web with cp and other illegal things, they might be safe in a technical sense that they are encrypted but the weight of the justice system is on their heels if they ever get caught. I don't know personally. For one thing, the easiest move is to not allow exchanges within the United States to carry it. Some people have no issue with this but me personally I'm only ever going to US or European companies as I don't trust overseas companies as they're not going to be legally libel for illegal activity or fraud.

@_date: 2018-12-13 17:53:37
I just don't see how demand can increase on such a volatile asset beyond the speculators... Retailers, especially small business, are not equipped to handle a 90% loss of their assets in a year. If there's no demand, the price is not going to "moon". It's a fundamental issues of the hard cap. It needs a mechanism to respond to increases or decreases in demand or it will never overcome volatility problems IMO.

I thought the core developers were moving away from Bitcoin acting as a currency for exchanges and more towards a "store of value" Why would anyone want to send something that could be worth more later? Alternatively why would anyone want to accept as payment something that could decrease 90% in value in a year?
