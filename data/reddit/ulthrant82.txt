That's not how a savings account works. You -can- put money in and take money out of a savings account, but thats not its intended purpose. You're talking about chequing accounts. Just like what you are describing is not the intended use for bitcoin. You're trying to manufacture a negative situation using very specific criteria.
If you had put 30k in a savings account 2 years ago and let it collect interest (ignoring the fact that most savings accounts will not accrue interest under 5k) you would have made around  $170 in interest.
If you had put that same 2k into a bitcoin account 2 years ago, you would have made $82,484.

Since we are speaking in highly unlikely hypotheticals, what happens if the US government devalues the dollar? What happens to your $30,170 If there's a bank run? Banks only carry 5% of the currency stored by its customers. The rest they loan out again at up to 20x. You're gonna want to say it's insured up to a certain amount. But if there's a bank run, there's isnt enough money in the insurance pool to cover it all. Likely it will all collapse and your money will be gone. Look at Greece as a perfect example. When the banks closed, many people turned to bitcoin when their government backed currency failed them.
Oh, and I screwed up on my math. You would have made $1.5 million with a bitcoin account.

By your logic, cars must be rare, since roughly only 6-7% people own cars. Every jewelry store has shelves full of diamonds and every mall in the civilized world has at least a couple jewelry stores. Right now, in any city in North America. I can likely find a store that will sell me a diamond.
The only real worth a diamond has that only a diamond will do is in industrial applications, and industrial diamonds are cheap. If they were rare, they wouldn't be cheap. The only reason diamond are even mined right now is because of unbelievably good marketing.

Why not? Banks still provide a service. It's the currency that bitcoin looks to replace. A "bitcoin bank" could provide all of the positive services a normal bank does with non of the negative (at least for us non-wealthy types) atributes. Imagine a bitcoin backed interac service that charged a small fee to provide instant transactions. You would complete your transaction in store, then the bank and the store would complete the authorization after the fact because the store could have faith in the bank completing the transaction, when it can have no such faith in a random customer. Interac is already in very nearly every commercial store in the world. Bitcoin adoption could skyrocket.

Lots of people missing the point. Crypto isn't anti-bank. Its anti-fiat.

What can you make with a $100 bill? How about a $5 bill? Intrinsically they are the same, no? Can I trade you a 100 for a 5 then?
Also, diamonds aren't rare or intrinsically valuable. It costs Jwaneng diamond mine in Namibia something like $40-$45/ct to produce diamonds.

Perhaps you should look again at what you posted. Your question was how can Capitalism be a failure when it's the most successful form of government, which is what I commented on, not the latter part which you stated it was the most successful form. I only stated that capitalism cannot be labeled a success by merely comparing it to other forms.. -that's all-. And it remains true no matter how much you try to obfuscate it. You're ignoring the actual question you raised because it is quite simply, illogical. 
By the way "Capitalism is the most successful Capitalist" is just stupid.

The point wasn't which one was good and which was bad. I simplified things. Sorry for confusing you.

A punch in the face is a better than a kick in the balls, is it not? By this logic then we say that a punch in the face is a good thing. I disagree.

Just because it's better than something else, doesn't mean it's any good. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:01:17
By ANY measure. You can't say A is good because it's better than B.. You can't say A is pretty because it's prettier than B.. You can't say A is loud, because it's louder than B.. You can't say A is dumb, because it's dumber than B.. Take your pick. By any measure. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:10:16
I'm not suggesting that at all. I'm suggesting that you can't say that Capitalism is a success based off the fact that it's better than, say, Anarchy. Just because it's MORE successful than another method, does not make it successful.
I never made any claims for or against any model of government. It may well be the best.. But that has nothing to do with what I said. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 07:24:09
Just because it hasn't failed as spectacularly as other systems doesn't make it a success.  It may make it "more successful" than another system, but by that definition again doesn't as a whole make it a success. It can still fail or be a failure while succeeding farther than all methods before it.

For the most part, yes. If the jewelry includes precious stones those will be factored or if it has a higher quality of craftsmanship, they might offer more. But the price of the gold is usually what they will offer you.

@_date: 2017-08-15 16:06:57
Gold has a sell and a buy price. So does every precious metal or collector coin.

Which way benefits the government the most? That's they way they will interpret it. Which is really all that matters in these types of scenarios. Whether you are in the right or not is irrelevant. 
Bitcoin is not considered currency, but they have no problem selling it for profit or taxing your profits.

Think of Interac, but for cryptocurrency. Imagine a card with a balance, but that balance was btc instead of USD. You can make purchases the exact same way, and the seller doesn't have to wait for the transaction to confirm, because the system has verified you have the necessary amount and has promised the transfer.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:52:31
But crypto is considered property, not currency.. So how can it be a cash advance if crypto isnt cash??

The punishment has to be severe enough to make the act not worthwhile. 
Incidentally, the lack of this behavior towards bankers has helped make bitcoin so popular.

The we should repeal the law that states he needs a permit. We can't blame the cops for enforcing laws we don't agree with. The cop isn't to blame, the law is. The cop was just doing his job too. How much are these permits that he wasn't able to get one? Perhaps the ability to waive the fees for people without the cash to pay them? Is it so bad for a governing body to maintain order, health and safety?

And that value cannot be hidden, that's the key. A bank could not simply say you had 1 btc and add it to your 'account' along with several others like they do with fiat. You can look at all transactions on your own and 1 btc cant be split.

Depends on how you look at it. 
1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC
Besides the price, what's the main difference between a $1000 camera and a $20 one? Accessibility.. Affordability. 
Almost everyone has a digital camera now as opposed to almost no one. Widespread adoption will not mean a $20 bitcoin. But it might mean 1 satoshi = 1 USD.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:04:32
But wouldn't that be a bank specific dollar? If the bank fails, it's coin fails.. if it's coin fails, the bank fails, but bitcoin keeps on. That actually sounds pretty good.
