Good question. Think that will actually work. Check  for up to date info about the fee to use. Beware though that fees could rise exponentially as a lot of people are experiencing the same problem.

Very good question. People are talking about it. But not on this forum.

Your site lists some information on palladium, but  gives a 404. Do you trade palladium?

What is your marketing strategy?

1) Your employer wants to pay you in (digital) fiat currency
2) You have to pay taxes in fiat currency
3) bitcoin is not yet adopted as widely as fiat

Good call. There's other banks that won't give you any trouble.

A human being is a part of the whole, called by us "Universe," a part limited in time and space.  He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.  This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.  Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of bitcoin to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.  Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security

The game isn't as smooth as agar yet, but we're having lots of fun. Give the free faucet rounds a try. :)

Tried to withdraw some ETH. Transaction completed. But it doesn't show up on the blockchain. Coins seem to be lost. Made a ticket. Many people are having the same problem (ETH and DASH)

Same day for me. More money and still nothing.
