do you really think China has neutered bitcoin? they are fast-tracking it for easy adoption as a 'non-currency' by drawing a line so soon. sure it is a bearish signal for the daytraders but this is far from 'neutering'. bitcoin doesn't need 100% market share to be successful. us politicians are too weak to control commerce, so china will field any currency advantage they can, and since china actually have power to be much much more commerce-restrictive on btc, it is very likely that there is danger of a short-bubble, where people sell off, thinking they will be able to buy even *more* BTC at a lower price.
people forget btc was never meant for 'mainstream adoption', it was meant to circumvent mainstream methods, which it still will do, more and more effectively all the time.

saying that tg people are 'somewhere between the two genders at best' is quite dehumanizing
people like to feel like people - this requires gender, its not calculus

the guy on the right and the girl on the left are basically in the real-life equivalent of the hunger games, except it is about investing and is represented by spacefaring creatures simulated on a modern battlescreen. the gladiators will have been readily prepared, perhaps, in the fashion that is equivalent to the standard, and with no undue force or unruly threat provoked unmeritoriously, they will have descended upon the battlefield represented by their separated data screens determined by a distinct mechanism purported to correct for any diversion of fair intent in careful maintenance of a just and forthright system. all correspondences have been gathered and combined into a salad of visual overload and the sound, a sheer sense of shrill cacophony as the partners in coincidence share part in the emergence of a distinctly baroque form: the keen eyes of the participants adhere to a strict order, a unconscious pattern intermittently relayed and mutually semitangible. No, no small order of events transpires around this confused call of modern epitasis. This is no dogecoin. This is the episteme metaphysique, the nomenon of continuous discretion. A meeting between two who's determination my fates has led them to this very unlikely place, seeped in legend, mystery upon mystery, like dolls inside one another, the kind you can keep removing layer upon layer like filo dough, just awestruck at the multiplicities, until you finally get to the very last one, and it is a potemkin village and every building including the chapel is really covered in nickelodeon green slime.

I think it was great news for bitcoin.
I own no bitcoins and think the price is way too high.
Precipitous declines would do it some good IMO.

Nobody with 's narrative has ever had the pretext of casual observation. He did not accidentally stumble upon a secret here. He is an asshat.
