I meant to say watch your *wealth* disappear slowly. Not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is here to stay. The cost per coin isn't.

The key is to hold, and watch as it all disappears slowly!

You said you made a large investment at 600 and again at 380. Do we have the same definition of making profit?

Sounds like you didn't actually invest $140,000.

It would be, and it doesn't make it any less valuable of an investment.

This is the same sentiment I have been materializing over the year. The interest is dying off. The media spun it like mysterious hacker money. The general public did not adopt it. If this is true, then shorting now will reap amazing rewards at the end of the year. 
On the other hand, a large, structured, and simplistic campaign or company could easily take bitcoin by the reigns and lead us to mass user adoption. There is a high probability of this given the amount of vested interest. This is why shorting could turn around on you very fast (e.x. the trend reversal on may 18)
Regardless of user adoption, bitcoin and other crypto markets will continue to fluctuate significantly based off of the market movers and human psychology. That is the only thing guaranteed.

Unless you have more money than you will ever be able to spend from  bitcoin. Then you might not care so much.

It was delusional from the start.
