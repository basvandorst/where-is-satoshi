The mobile app, ok that makes sense. I'll make sure this issue gets looked at right away.

Where are you seeing that? I see a much smaller spread. Would you mind posting a screenshot?

Bank wires do usually arrive same day if we get them before 2pm PDT. That's our cut-off. Of course something has gone amiss with yours, so let's figure it out. PM me and I'll see if I can help. We often get wires that don't have reference numbers. Unfortunately it seems that banks aren't consistent about how they format wires. It's almost like we need a better system...

Yep, that's what I'd do.

Every trade has two sides. So, yes.

Useful link:
We operate a maker / taker fee model. Only takers pay a fee. If you place an order onto the book, you will become maker. If you match an *existing order* on the book, you become a taker.
Bid / Ask is $910.00 / $920.00.
I place a limit order to buy at $900.00. My order would not be matched, and would go onto the order book until it is matched. When it is matched by someone willing to sell for $900.00 I become the maker, the other side is taker.
A limit order does not guarantee you will be maker, unless you select the 'post only' option under advanced order types.
Second example:
Bid / Ask is $910.00 / $920.00.
I place a market order to buy $100 worth of BTC. The lowest ask is $920.00 so that's the price I get per BTC. I become the taker and the other side is maker. All market orders are takers as they are filled from orders already on the book.
You can be maker or taker both when you are buying or selling. And in some cases of partial order matches it is possible that your order would fill as partially maker / taker, though that would be rare.

The fast drop in price certainly attracted our attention. We've investigated this and can confirm it is all legitimate trading activity.

Please email us about this so we can take a look.

I explain it the same way. The follow-up question is usually "what is mining?". I tell them mining is the act of checking each transaction and providing unalterable proof that a group of transactions happened. Every 10 minutes the miners that provide the proof are rewarded with bitcoin. You need supercomputers for mining.

For placing limit orders you can try GDAX.  - just sign in using your Coinbase account credentials.

At the top-left of the page switch the trading pair to one with ETH in it. That switches the context of the interface and you will now see the ETH deposit option. :)

Glad I could help. :)

We don't have trailing stops yet, but maybe in the future as we add more advanced order types. Limits are different on GDAX, there's only a withdrawal limit that starts at $10,000 a day. No other limits on trading or deposits.

Authy is a third-party service used to manage your 2-factor. It's connected to your mobile device and means you can use SMS as a backup for 2fa codes. Authy have made some great security improvements recently.
Google Authenticator is not associated with your device. It's very secure but there is a slight trade-off in convenience.
On Coinbase / GDAX you can choose to use Google Authenticator and disable 2-factor via SMS. This provides a great balance between security and convenience.
Check out a write up by our head of security that was posted last week here:

We get about 3,500 customer interactions by email each week, and only about 20 on reddit. It's very low overhead for us to respond to people on reddit and try to help. Nine times out of ten when we check their account they are already in touch with someone here and there's no additional way to help them. In this particular case the customer account is being mandatorily shut down, so they started this process with unfortunate circumstances.

Hi - we delayed the ETC withdrawals from GDAX until around October 17th. The recent issues with Ethereum node stability have taken the attention of our team, but we'll get there soon!
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:02:42
We've seen a few reports now, and we're looking into it as a matter of priority. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 05:15:51
Our official announcements on this issue:
As a reminder: don't attempt to send ETC to GDAX or Coinbase. GDAX and Coinbase is not supporting or storing any incoming ETC.

Hi. The idea here is to have the same requirements for all our customers. This allows us to provide better features for everyone. I'll go over some of the differences:
Limits - On GDAX right now there are limits on how much you can deposit and withdraw daily, and this is awkwardly connected to Coinbase buy/sell limits due to the way the platform is set up. The new requirements (which most customers already meet) allow us to remove the deposit limit, and have a $10k daily withdrawal limit. 
There is also currently a balance limit. This is very counter-intuitive. The new requirements allow us to remove this limit too.
Wires - Wire transfers are available only to customers that go through an extensive enhanced due diligence process with our compliance team. We're simplifying this greatly with the new requirements (which is just verify your ID, and your address) and enabling same-day bank wires for all customers. Faster deposits and withdrawals is one of our top requested improvements.
The new requirements are not a very high bar. Upload a photo ID, and confirm your address. Most people have already done it long ago on our platform. 
We're excited about these changes, and the future changes that are coming.

You can try signing out on both GDAX and Coinbase first. Sorry if you already tried this. I don't know of a systemic problem similar to yours at the moment.

Coinbase is a company, and you would never be asked to send your funds to me as an individual. The appropriate equivalent of asking for ID is asking for money transmitter licenses in this case. You can see those linked here where appropriate:  
I hope that helps.
