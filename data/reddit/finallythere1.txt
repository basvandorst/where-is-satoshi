Expect the unexpected. it will go upwards. Logic says we have to short it but always reverse makes money always.
@_date: 2018-08-01 08:24:02
We need to reverse the question and ask to him ? What solution Fiat money offers ? 
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:35:45
Let me ask you a question. What if miners stop mining due to cost ? I mean for instance if price drops 1000usd  nobody is going to Mine and there will be transaction.
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:11:04
For instance the price goes up from 50 to 150 if you look on lineer scale you will see 3 units up. Then the price goes to 200 from 150 just one unit. As you can see there are not same from 50 to 150 %300 increase on the other hand from 150 to 200 just %33.
İn order to see big picture you have to use lig graphic which shows percentage better.

Havent you had any mathematic lesson ?
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:29:14
1,) who sells ?
2.) its impossible to collect such a big amount of BTC without moving price.
Answer : probably big exchanges moving their cold wallets, nothing else.

Another prophecy fucked up.
@_date: 2019-08-05 08:52:46
Every traditional chart expert says that there is a GAP in BTC. What they dont see is there isnt any GAP in BTC. Let me express my thoughts . BTC is traded 7/24 if you have an asset like this there cannot be any GAP.  Traditional markets close on wekends and so cme. So ? İt not bitcoins problem its the problem in the stracture of cme. I do not say BTC never hit 8600 8400 area where cme GAP stays. I just say there was never a GAP bitcoin and there will be never a GAP bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:37:05
What can I say , u are right
@_date: 2019-02-20 04:39:28
Fucked up ?
@_date: 2019-02-10 04:29:53
Yes Izmir
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:31:16
Fk you
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:48:09
Friendly reminder : cme GAP is one you should omit, techically u know as well as I do that there cant be a GAP in 7/24 open product, it doesnt mean it is not gonna fill, what I mean to say is just ignore it while considering future price movements.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:19:01
I can write down all details but this is not my point. I pay 20k Satoshi and 2.45 USD and expecting receive it, not waiting for confirmotion for 22 hours.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:35:32
As a payment method It seems so :(
@_date: 2019-02-06 22:26:50
Thats what I am talking about its backed by bitcoin on the platform not in my private wallet, in case of bankrupcty of this firm who is gonna secure my bitcoin ?
Whats more in classical stock investment even a broker banckrupts my stocks are going to stay in custadian account. That is my point. Now what is your counter argument your turn buddy. ???
@_date: 2019-02-06 18:57:23
For instance I invest 50k USD in stock if abra banckrupts I will lose the whole money I invested just because there is no custodian. No thanks man such a very risky way to invest in stocks. I dont wanna trust in a 3rd party solution. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:34:19
Its bitmex, bitmex to my wallet and I paid the fee to miners not to bitmex. And once again its just a detail. The problem is its not yet a payment method. I dont complain here about my unconfirmed payment Its another case I am trying to say we need an improvement and other ways in order to achive scability problem.
