What do you mean? I was motivated not to be like my parents who lived paycheck to paycheck, and worried about what we would have supper each day.
I was motivated to go to college so i can work somewhere other than a factory.
I was motivated to choose a degree that is in demand instead of something stupid like history.
Education and motivation. You can come from nothing. Stop giving out excuses.

poor education choices and lack of motivation.

Father is a factory worker supported family of 5 worked 70+ hours a week, now I work at the biggest professional services company in the world in their IT department so my kids do not have to worry about what they eat. I put myself through college and put school and work above my social life my whole life. Not going to give a in depth spill because you do not care nor would I expect you too.
If you live in the US you have no excuse outside of disabilities. I wouldn't classify my life as luck at all. Or you can over simplify it and blame everyone else but yourself.
Darn Fiat.

I know it seems obvious to you guys, but last November someone told me to buy Bitcoin (I've known about it since high school in 2012) I wanted to but the price was like $700 or something so I knew I didn't have that much cash for it so I passed. I did not know at the time that I could buy part of a bitcoin. I just assumed it was like a stock or something.
So it may seem stupid to you guys, but us normies need our hands held.

Is bitcoin in a bubble?
