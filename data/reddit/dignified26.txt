Maybe satoshi wanted the impression of scarcity to be the driving force to support or belief in the technology.... Items being priced in less than a "whole" unit gives ME the impression that whatever im paying with has alot of value and/or must be hard to come by..(scarce)

Bitcoin don't have nothing on religion. Aint got shiiiiiiaaat.
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:00:20
Of course its unreasonable and greedy...you paid 1.8 btc you should only be refunded that amount...your mistake is you are pegging your coin to usd so you want equivalent in usd back in coin....would you still be so supportive if it jumped higher and your refund  would be only 1 btc????
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:45:06
Scarcity will kick in the halving after next...thats ~5 years, also the amount in existence will be known unlike many other forms of money. But hey, semantics is fun to argue..for some people.

The number of possible addresses (2^160)  or 1.4 x 10^48  ( wallet id's) how you put it.
If there actually were a billion users of bitcoin who EACH  generated a billion addresses every day..we would be fine for millenia...
Many people have problems comprehending just how large these numbers are...they are limits of classical computing thermodynamics..
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:46:30
 .4btc/day?? What calculator you using...you would be lucky to get .2/day at current difficulty more like .12btc/day and thats if you had it right NOW not taking in consideration next diff jump is less than 4 days away and ~17% jum which means you make 17% less and less and less every jump
Dont buy the shovel...too late...... the rush in mining came since dec/jan and hasnt slowed down since

Its a roller coaster...bitcoin is inflationary for the next decade or so...plus most major companies accepting it cash out to fiat immeadiately and 3600+ a day from mining alone maybe more ....who knows if most miners are dumping..and to add alittle more on top ...all the trading at these exchanges which provide margin trading etc...
Enjoy the ride...cost average down and be prepared to be on this roller coaster for the next couple years in my opinion...

Your paper wallet would be "randomly" generated by the specific software you would use to create it...how good the actual randomness is dependent on the software.
Imagine the wallet you would print out which would have your bitcoin "address" and priv key as being random numbers chosen from a large set of possible numbers...
Keep your private key private..if it is comprimised then so are any of your coins you sent to the associated address
Preferably a computer not connected to the internet on a fresh operating system install to create your paperwallets ....then uninstall if youre that paranoid

I thinks it is safe to say that centralized systems TODAY can carry out tasks more efficiently and in the situation you describe more instantaneously. However bitcoin is the first of its kind. Its fundamentally different because it is DE-centralized. ..bitcoin is the only tool where a distributed consensus can exist ON A GLOBAL SCALE..being global satoshi chose 10 min confirmations as to limit the amount of orphaned blocks to ensure most tranactions are included in the subsequent block while taking in consideration of network propagation on a global scale...
If you have another method that exists outside the SYSTEM is DE-centralized, global and solves the Byzantine Generals Problem of TRUST on an UNSECURE NETWORK by all means compare. If you dont then all i ask is take in consideration bitcoin is 6 years old and brand new and DE-centralized systems are just starting out...Welcome to the future.

SHA-2 is an open algorithm and it uses as its constants the sequential prime cube roots as a form of "nothing up my sleeve numbers".  For someone to find a weakness or backdoor in SHA would be the equivalent of the nobel prize in cryptography.   Everyone who is anyone in the cryptography community has looked at SHA-2.  Not just everyone with a higher degree in mathematics, computer science, or cryptography in the last 20 years but foreign intelligence agencies and major financial institutions.    Nobody has found a flaw, not even an theoretical one (a faster than brute force solution which requires so much energy/time as to be have no real world value)

Im going to have to agree with  my biggest concern...polite bu115hit...up until the last day...im pretty sure most of the drafts "improvements" from now until the final draft will be minor changes that probably wont even apply to the clauses that bother us most..
As for  i am amazed at the audacity of these regulators and how far-reaching this bitlicense is in its current form

A centralized cryptocurrency will have worse ramifications then even our current system everyone is always crying about on /rbitcoin...it would allow full manipulation of code and mining power to a central authority....who can double spend withhold transactions etc...
Id rather have cash than a centralized crypto...at least you can have true anonymity with cash transactions

Reread the whitepaper, or read it if you never had. Part 6 incentive...i think the bitcoin retards are the ones that want to seperate bitcoins from the blockchain forgetting that the current inflation of bitcoins is what gives the blockchain its security and the incentives satoshi developed are the genius behind Bitcoin.
