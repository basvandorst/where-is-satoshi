I believe in this revolutionary technology too. We are in the beginning and it will evolve beyond our imagination. Too long, the world has been dictated by centralized arbitrarily-created money, and all its associated problems. Decentralized, more rule-specific (algorithmic generation) bitcoin will serve as a powerful counter. I see these two forms of money co-existing side for a time. 
It would be cool to see in the far future either a moneyless society (a utopian dream society with essentially no cost to food, shelter, medical, etc) or a society where all members receive each a set algorithmic periodic amount. For example: 100,000 members x 3currency per day minus a small fee designated to an algorithmic entity or entities for each generation of money. This would be a fair distribution of money. There would be an unfixed amount of currency that can be generated, however the intelligent nonhuman algorithmics can release currencies or decrease generation base on advanced rules or even destroy currency (using their pool of currency collected from fees) beyond the normal generation rate to adjust for market supply and demand to keep value relatively stable. Someone decides to hoard a large ratio of currency? No problem, the algorithmics account for this by adjusting the currency in their pool.
And the algorithmics would serve as impartial sytems. What do I mean by impartial sytem? It means a trustless system and paradoxically a trusted system. Imagine defendants going to court, for the same or similar crime, and each is tried by different judges, and each will be given different sentences. One gets one year, another gets ten years, and so on, etc. This is a very partial and unfair system. You cannot trust it. However, instead you had advanced, complex rules that determine what the sentencing should be, and this is encoded into a system. This system is trustless because it's a known rule; you can trust it to be fair and impartial. This is the same thing that happened with the Diffie-Hellman public-private key invention. They created an impartial system that could be trusted by removing the need to trust communications between sources. You are a company that needs to transact orders with a million other companies. How do you validate honest and secure exchanges with each company? Enter public-private key communications protocol. And now we have bitcoin, a new communications protocol that go beyond public-private key. For everyone one of us here that don't lack imagination, we are aware how BIG this is. Bitcoin introduces a way for a thousand people (or a group or whatever number you want to put in here) to achieve consensus. This is mind-boggling sigificance and excitement.  
In an even further future, people could split themselves up like Agent Smith from the Matrix and each become 100% representatives of rule-making in Inception time-layers. ;)  
Also, the 100millionth in bitcoin does not have to be the final unit. We should make changes when we determine its fit.

You can make the timer any length you want. Say 1 year or 2 years, and keep resetting/modifying the timer at your discretion.
The point is: you won't die and have an encrypted container that no one can feasibly access.

Sorry for the late reply. Just logged in since last post.
With the type of distribution I'm thinking of, it's not forcing any group to give it to another group. I see it as another way of filtering artificial money into society to represent value. Right now, money creation is controlled by the powerful few, and as such policies of distribution and spending are askewed as a result of that system.

Basically, unless you're insane, you're not going to try and corrupt the network. And even if you do succeed in doing it, it would only be for a small window of time, and the cost you spend will far outweigh what you would gain. You can't steal someone else's bitcoin through it.

I am not making any claim that btc will destroy fiat currency. In another post, I even mentioned that they will exist side by side for a time. I was responding to your mention of bitcoin being adopted exclusively and how bitcoin would possibly grow in reverse to accommodate new value. Like fiat $1,000 becoming $10,000, bitcoin 0.00000001 becomes 0.00000000001, and so on.
My example of value creation is simplified too. But to create any large number of things requires, sure, that can require a large combination of resources. Money in the form of investment makes it easier.
When you involve bitcoin, one of the properties is that it is decentralized and we are just beginning to find out what that means.
I also mentioned the creation of fiat money, and the questions how much do we print and when we do print? What is the criterion for this? This is a big problem. Print too much, national currencies collapse, like has happened and is happening. Don't print enough, and economies get depressed. Right now, it's practically impossibly for humans to determine how much money to circulate to align with value in the system. 
There is also the distribution issue, which is a FUCK YOU and FUCK ME, the common people. Corruption happens, the corrupters get billions, and you pay your taxes.
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:36:27
We're aware of flaws. We're aware of valid criticisms. We understand it's not perfect.
However, the freedom of bitcoin and its properties supersede these flaws and criticisms. And bitcoin also offers other forms of protection differentiated from the traditional bank-and-credit-card, as well in that it is far less corruptible than traditional fiat. 
I trust math more than I trust our ambitious counterparts, with all our varying and sometimes conflicting interests. Give me a system that is impartial and more fair than the current system. Give me a mechanism that won't violate people's livelihoods and inflate their reality with lies.
In the words of Andreas:
It's good enough.

We are entering a new era with new systems. The world is expanding into greater digital environments, and bitcoin is emerging as a highway to connect that digital realm.
We have electronic sports (starcraft, league of legends, etc) and we have streamers who make a living *playing videogames*. We have app makers who solicit for donations but donations have been a painstaking process.
Now you have a community telling you, implement bitcoin as a donation method and we'll donate. What is more straightforward than this? And will it really negatively impact those who don't use bitcoin?
Microtransactions will become a part of the future. You can literally support or patronize anything you want. Like a comment or a site or a song or a drawing or an article or whatever. Karma with real monetary value.

The creation of value can be represented by anything. It does not have to be just money. 
You don't have to create "new" bitcoin to create new worth in the world; and new worth would not require any central authority. We create new value everyday. You go out and grow potatoes for food and create worth. I go out and hunt bears for meat and fur; there is worth. We don't need anything else to exchange between meat and potato; however, given there are many things that can be exchanged in the real world (ideas, thoughts, products, labor, etc), a form of money is useful and extremely convenient as a standard of exchange to represent value.
Also, bitcoin is divisible; right now the smallest unit is satoshi but that can change in the future. To absorb new value creation on an exclusive bitcoin standard, the value of bitcoin rises and/or becomes more divisible.
The other issue is how much and when a country decides to print money. There are too many variables for a human to currently account for to determine how much money to print and when, so the powers extrapolate as best as they can. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 03:19:41
This security aspect is definitely an issue but I don't think the majority of people in developed nations will want to be their own bank any time soon.
If you don't believe that fiat will run to zero or worthless within a certain timeframe, there is better protection in institutionalized agencies rather than you trying to secure it yourself.
That said, there is minimal risk for people to acquire small increments of bitcoin for use. I think with this gradual adoption in small doses, once people become accustomed to the workings of it, there might be a proliferation in adoption, resulting in greater need for security and possible solutions.

Of course, everyone participating in bitcoin wants to see its value rise. I hope that more people realize that instead of hyping up value, it's better to help create value, and a good approach to do that is to show it, as we somewhat are doing.

This is what I have on a dedicated machine for bitcoin wallet, running windows, using firefox browser:
* requestpolicy
* noscript
* betterprivacy
Set the options for these addons. 
In firefox about:config, there are alot of options you can configure, especially more in-depth settings for addons. Delete or change anything that you prefer no connection to. Stuff like safebrowsing, etc, are website checks sent to google.
Free software: 
* windows 8 firewall control
* sandboxie
If you can find linux versions, let me know.
Imo, sandboxie is extremely useful (after first free month, you have to wait 5 second for loading). Drive-by-downloads, rogue ads have extra barrier to infect the rest of your system. 
Don't use a static ip if you can. Unplug modem. In your wired router, clone your mac address. Save it. Unplug router. Plug modem back in. Wait for it to fully connect, then power up router. You may have to restart your pc, or, depending on your devices, power up the router first then modem.
Use wireshark (older versions that don't phone home; wireshark 1.8.8 or something) and monitor your traffic. On my system, even with the browser open, I see no traffic going in and out to the internet if I haven't surfed to a site or used app that requires connectivity.
On windows,  I disable all unnecessary processes, services, scheduled tasks. You should do similar on ubuntu or whatever linux your using.
Also, you should still have usb drives with encrypted containers to protect your wallet.

This is the fundamental premise of the value of currency. It has value because people say so. 
Reading the comments below, it seems people are taking the topic statement too literally. That a government, gold, armies, assets, or nothing can back currency, no one is disputing that.
There is nothing to detract from the reasons why we agree to something of value. We are all aware bitcoin is agreed as value because of its properties. Ease of transmittal, teleportation-like effect, an advanced algorithm monitored by a living network, no known hacking vulnerability in the protocol itself, a fixed amount, an impartial system of trust, decentralization, etc.

Base on what you mean by everyday transactions, there is not much benefit to using bitcoin. However, if you care, as a single male that likes to buy lipstick and women's underwear, and having that informationed collected into a marketer's database when using debit/credit cards, then there might be the pseudo-anonymity aspect in personal privacy.
If your definition of everyday transactions include, besides buying drugs, other things like: 
* playing poker online
* tipping/paying for online strippers
* tipping/showing appreciation for something you enjoy or strong affect
* donation to a cause or open source software or kickstarter games
* porn site access
* vpn
then there is alot of benefit, particularly if you don't want easy access to your financial habits.

There are excellent responses to this already. Let me add:
When we educate people and are able to get to them to accept how it's in their interest, we also prepare their minds to accept a new way of doing things. Many people become so accustomed to how things are, they don't see how cumbersome and outdated a credit card payment system is. Sure, there are benefits in these traditional systems that currently are superior over the bitcoin system. With the bitcoin system, if your money is lost, its lost (until m-of-n multi sigs and escrows). You have to look to yourself as the ultimate responsibility, and that may not necessarily be a bad thing. This is not new to the unbanked parts of the world. 
We have to keep in mind the strengths and weaknesses of the two systems. One has been around for decades. It has the strength of infrastructure and backing. But one weakness is that it can't be decoupled. You're a member of a very conservation church but secretly support gay-lesbian organizations, and you want to donate funds over the internet. Any donation, any online service requires your personal information. With bitcoin, the pseudoanonymous aspect takes out that factor. If you're concern about privacy, about your habits and inclinations, your medical history, pricing discrimination, it would be much more be difficult for marketing companies to collect your information. Also, the harm to your credit when someone steals your identity, in a bitcoin world their is no credit identity to steal.
Bitcoin has its risks, no doubt. That's why we educate people on safeguards and let them make informed decisions, and we support those who are pioneering new technologies. Bitcoin is not user-friendly, no doubt. That's why we need wallets that are essentially cash or giftcard or credit card parallels; something with one or more proximity barcodes (can be hidden barcodes) that you carry around and protect like current cars (and just wave near a sensor to use; the hidden proximity stuff has been around for a while, just not converted to bitcoin).  
One does not need to completely destroy the other. It can and should exist as an alternative way of doing something. Centralization is not wholly bad. Even bitcoin hasn't gotten away from that (centralizationed marketplaces like coinbase and exchanges).
Ideally, we should get people to realize the improvements and the strengths. When the technology is ready, they will be more incline to embrace it.

Being non tech-savvy, I would highly suggest getting a second device (like a cheap desktop or laptop) and using that solely for bitcoin. Connect it to the internet when you need it, and limit what sites you go to (like coinbase). 
If you get a laptop, make sure to disable wifi when you're not using it. Laptops typically have two "adapters" that allow connection to the internet. One is a physical connection adapter and the second is a wireless adapter. You can disable the wireless adapter and directly plug your ethernet cable into the router.
 
Get a few usb drives and store wallet copies on them.
Ideally, you want to encrypt those wallets. You will have to do your research on that. Until then, physical lock and key in a steel fire/water-proof mini-safe.

I'm trying to see your perspective, but I can't see the parallel of what Switzerland is attempting with what you're referring to.
The government is already legislating currency. The people are already giving money from one group to another through their social programs and universal healthcare.

That's why I want to see what happens.

One possibility: a timer or lifespan on the password that protects the wallet. Basically, the password dies after a certain time has passed.
Suppose you use something like a truecrypt container to hold the wallet. You, the owner, can set the timer for any length you want, and reset/modify the timer at leisure. Once the time is up, the password requirement disappears, and the wallet can be accessed without a password.

I see greater adoption happening through micro-uses. The average person in developed nations is not going to place all their funds into bitcoin. However, they will see something they want that is best purchased using bitcoin, funded in small doses. There are alot of vendors out there, alot of apps that people want, alot of games, alot of online gambling, alot of porn, alot of other services. You really don't want to risk your banking/credit/debit history being opened to all these places and data mining firms. Or consider, you're a private researcher looking into weird fetishes whose site are paid content. Bitcoin or your personal credit card? Or you just want to donate with minimal hassle and greater privacy. Or buy handcrafted quality shoes from persia. There's all kind of stuff that you can do right now with bitcoin that is more useful than other forms of payment.
These micro-funds will enter into the bitcoin network, and reinforce usage and value. It will grow the network like rain torrent swelling over the river bank.

It was derived in the market but has evolved for a reason. Salt, pepper, ivory tusks, feathers, gold, wheat for wood, etc. There were too many standards of trade.
The creation of money through algorithms, although initiated by humans, is taken out of human hands and becomes less corruptible. This holds true for the distribution as well. Allow everyone to mine, or credit everyone participating equally. Over time, the distribution obviously won't be the same as people leverage their abilities to render products and services for others' credits.
