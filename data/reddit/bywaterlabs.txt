I think this article is pretty ridiculous. Nvidia and AMD both decided not to prepare for the 2018 GPU crypto mining market by refusing to make more chips than the previous year. As far as I understand it, they both thought that GPU mining wasn't going to be as big of a deal as it has turned out to be so far this year.
Well, they were wrong about that. Although profitability was down for a while, it's currently back up due to the price of ETH and the forking of Monero. Both obviously important altcoins.
So, are we to trust their opinion now? Their being wrong caused huge price hikes this year. We're still going through that. If they just made more cards, it wouldn't be as much of a problem...
I get it. Crypto is volatile. If I was the president of a GPU chip company I probably wouldn't be super into making mining equipment if I thought it might not be around for that long.
It's almost like the inclusion of GPUs in the decentralized network has forced a whole industry, the gaming industry, to either choose to become a part of cryptocurrency, or just suffer the price volatility and become an even more divided community. If I was a hardcore pc gamer, I would definitely mine, too. But, I'm a miner and I really don't game that much at all. Not with new cards, either.
I know this comment is all over the place, but really all I'm trying to say is that articles like this bug me because they take price charts and just write some text above the dips and act like they have uncovered some deep truth. Oh, hey, look... I can use photoshop. Woo. Look, this is what that dip means, and this is what that dip means and...yeah. Can you really make these super precise explanations for the little dips and bumps we see every week?
