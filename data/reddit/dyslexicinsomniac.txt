As an average person i will look and say DANG thats awesome but then figure how its super hard to get bitcoin and lose money on the exchange rate fluctuations and exchange fees then decide fuck this and never use it because i like convenience. The big online megamarts will laugh and realize they have less friction to enter their ecosystem and economy of scale advantages as well that make price/convenience  competition with them near impossible even with their middle man cut. Open bazaars lack of built-in privacy features will make it barely used for the types of thing that would make it take off like moonshine and tax free cigs Or people that just want to run a business without going through the nightmarish process of getting business licenses and complying with bullshit laws and proper accounting for tax bullshit. 
  Im not anti bitcoin or open bazaar. Its just a pain in the ass to enter the bitcoin ecosystem and open bazaar is useless if i have to worry about the government raiding my girlfriend for all the handmade jewelry she sold in the free market but didnt pay uncle sugar a cut or have a proper business license.
