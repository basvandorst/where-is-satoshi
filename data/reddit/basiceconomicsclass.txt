I dont know, I think if the average person understood that anywhere from 2-10% of their money is stolen from them every year, they would gladly turn to bitcoin. Education is key.

Not voluntarily, therefore its theft.

The flow decreases aswell.

Wouldn't having less money make them care more about how much is taken?

Utility in a monetary role yes, but not much else. Most people think money should be a commodity with  uses outside of money, but in actuality that will hurt the money in the long term.

The best money through history has had very little real world utility, as utility could potentially cause wild swings in production of the money, and therefore devalue the money. Gold being the best example. It was used as money for its scarcity and lack of utility, and was prized for its monetary use. Bitcoin is the first money with guaranteed scarcity and almost no utility beyond its monetary role, making it the most perfect money that's ever existed.

Maybe the value is just conversing with other adults. Maybe not the right place for yourself.

Let me ask you a question. Who do you think would _value_ a $10 bill more? A poor man or a rich man? The more money you have the less each extra dollar is valued, and the less money you have, the more each extra dollar is valued.

This idea that we need to promote consumption through inflation to build the economy is based on Keynesian economics. The reality is consumption consumes wealth, while production produces wealth, and production requires savings and investment.

I think you're better off going back to your parents basement, playing your call of duty, with your Dorito covered finger tips, than attempting to have a conversation with adults.

Cheap money means cheap loans. Cheap loans mean more loans. More loans means more currency inflation, through fractional reserve banking. More currency inflation means less currency value. Less currency value means more currency pours into real stores of value.

Because you cant eat, drink, or live in bitcoin. Gold is deflationary, yet the largest economic growth in human history happened under a gold standard. This idea that we need to promote consumption, and to promote "wants" is ludicrous. Its human nature to "want", and to consume. We should be promoting savings, as its capital accumulation that increases our productive capability, and our wealth.

The _price_ fluctuates due to supply and demand. _Value_ on the other hand is completely subjective, and can change at any time.

Doesnt matter which one you would spend or hold. The only reason btc doesn't get spent is because merchants still want fiat. Once merchants want btc, and dont want fiat, you'll have no option but to spend your btc. Only if merchants have to accept both at the same face value, does Greshams law apply.
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:32:47
Greshams law only applies where legal tender laws require both monies to have same face value.

With bigger block sizes comes the risk of centralization.

Golds purchasing power increases slowly over time. Not necessarily due to the supply of gold, so technically not deflation in the Austrian sense, but due to improved productivity. Either way gold could purchase more goods with the same amount of gold over time.

What's your alternative? Some sort of socialist/communist utopia?
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:54:48
Well there you go. Absolutely nothing is stopping a group of people from coming up with an idea and creating a buisness model like you describe. So what's your issue? You want to force people to do it this way?
@_date: 2019-06-07 23:46:37
Increasing the block size also increases the size of the blockchain, which then requires more storage to run a full node. If the blockchain increases faster than storage technology, fewer people will be able to run them.
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:48:18
Nope, I'm asking in which way you would want private companies to be run? Money theory and buisness structures are two very different things.

Gold backed fiat made sense, as gold wasn't very portable. What attributes of fiat does bitcoin not do better?

Money replaced barter, as barter was too inefficient.  An example is If I had a cow, but needed a chicken, I needed to find someone with a chicken who wanted a cow. The goods had value to someone, but finding the right person was difficult. This is where money came in. Finding a medium, that represented the value of goods, but that everyone could agree on. Salt, sea shells, precious metals, have all been used as money, not because they have a value, but because they are an agreed upon representation of the value of goods and services, that people can trade in exchange for said goods and services.
@_date: 2019-04-23 09:46:05
Money isnt meant to be worth anything. Its an intermediary to make trade easier. Money helps facilitate the trade of goods and services, which are the true wealth.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:46:02
Because you dont like the answer, doesnt make it  not true. Money is only valuable because everyone agrees it has value.
