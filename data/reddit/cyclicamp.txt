Just because chargebacks don't occur frequently doesn't mean they don't serve a very useful purpose.  They won't faze reputable merchants, but it's not like sleazy fly-by-night merchants don't exist out there.  And many of these can't accept credit cards, not just because the cc companies revoke usage after a certain number of infringements but also because they leave a paper trail.
Sticking to using a credit card offers quite a bit of protection against this type of company.  One might not need it when buying an xbox that's available from many merchants that have widely known reputations.  But if you need something specialized and expensive, and is only sold by 3-4 places worldwide, trust and protection become relevant.  
And sometimes, even those trusted merchants can start getting lazy, perhaps due to new ownership, poor customer service policies, or simply because they're circling the drain financially.
Obviously this doesn't mean bitcoin should be written off completely.  But without an incentive like a direct, advertised discount there's little reason not to use a cc everywhere you normally would.

The comment is upvoted by people as opposed to reddit or a third party assigning it a score, the score being tied to the score of another comment, a bunny pressing a button with food on it, the score being generated randomly, etc.
Everything has some amount of value and some amount of utility.  In general, these two words are synonyms.  I would define their difference in that people assign value or worth by judging utility.  And they occasionally diverge, and thus the two do not necessarily correlate all the time, because people can be irrational in assigning value.

Within the context of that section, they're saying that because *in the specific function of being a medium of exchange* bitcoin does not offer an advantage, and in that regard there's nothing compelling people to switch from what they're already using.
There's nothing wrong with this paragraph.  You can say, "but what about gold?  That was grassroots!"  It was, but at whatever historical time point currencies began to be used over simple trading, *gold would have had the advantage of being a superior medium of exchange*.  Along with other choice items like copper and silver, it's a stable, dividable, portable (as in, due to value/rarity, you don't have to carry pounds of it to do trading) and recognizable element as opposed to, say, seashells or some other naturally occurring item.  There actually was a driving force, in that specific aspect of currency, for its adaptation.

I don't doubt it, but if scammers were really trying to get money there'd be more requests for a less noticeable amount.  Like in the disclosure page you've posted around the thread, a 1 BTC request would have a better chance of getting accepted than a 730,000 BTC request.  Just like the Simpsons robo-caller.
Make no mistake though - now that the information's out there, the worst is yet to come.  Payment requests will start looking more legitimate, email addresses will be targeted to be compromised, accounts will be attacked, etc.

It would be nice, but I have my doubts that sort of thing is possible at this point.  Now, I spoke of everyone *here* in my last comment, but outside of here there's big numbers and big money that couldn't care less about something like that. There are so many people who really don't care as long as they make money.
Now, these types of people will also follow the money.  So if enough people take a step back and disinvest due to incompetence, others will follow for other motivations.  But I'm not sure, at this stage in the game, if there's enough interest in doing so.  
It may take an even more catastrophic failure on mtgox's part to convince people to pull out their money at any cost, and for those people it might even be too late depending on the type of failure (and for USD users, there's the chance it's too late now).

I see hypocrisy in a community jumping to make/upvote comments that label Karpeles "a fraud and a thief with a target on his back (*wink wink nudge nudge*)" while at the same time going out of their way to defend Ross Ulbricht of all charges despite the amount of evidence against him.  
Karpeles makes statements contrary to the evidence against him and people are outspokenly ready to lynch him (in many cases literally).  Ulbricht makes pleas contrary to the evidence against him and people are ready to debate every aspect of that evidence, examine the parties making these claims, and look to shoehorn the word "allegedly" into every instance of casual conversation on the topic.
Obviously these two cases are not the same.  I'm not saying the evidence against each of these people are equivalent, and that they necessarily should each be afforded the exact same level of benefit of doubt.  But I am saying that level has been absurdly lopsided.
**The tl;dr thesis if you want to skip the above**: The minority of people who argue on principle are good, but the majority just want their money/service and get pissed when it's taken from them.  Which is fine, but obnoxious when it's made out to look like some moral high road.

You're right, I'm just addressing the part of the post suggesting that the account received an amount of money that it did not.

But as said, that's a question of how the industry as a whole grows.  If there's 6 companies worth $6 total, then one company worth $5, then the industry shrunk.  Growth isn't guaranteed of course, but you're still coming out on top in your investment and I think that was the point he was making.

I agree at the moment.  Basically, for one to do better than not investing at all, the growth of the company/value of one share has to exceed the growth of btc/value of one coin.

Right, you'll always have the value of the percentage of the company.  If fiat is stable, you will retain that value in fiat.  
Now, you could always lose fiat if that particular currency decided to skyrocket in value compared to the company as well, that just tends to happen less or at a slower rate.

You're pretty much right, it depends on which side there's unreliability.  We've seen both.  When there's problems removing a major currency (like USD), currency/BTC goes up.  When there's problems removing BTC, currency/BTC goes down.
Volume's guaranteed to drop in this case, but there's no guarantee as to how the rate will play out.  In a general unreliability case, we would probably just see this market lag behind other ones.

Let's consider the alternative to full disclosure.  Coinbase still does nothing, and someone else eventually figures it out along the way.  Then the issue becomes, what does that person do?  Eventually, someone's going to find this and do exactly what was done - exploit it.
The difference here is, instead of everybody freaking out about how coinbase could have been hacked, we already know the method and severity thanks to the previous disclosure.  
Disclosure might have sped up the exploit process, sure.  But it definitely mitigates the damage as well.

The meaning behind the phrase "too big to fail" in the context of banking crime means "too big to *let* fail."  Obviously nothing in the world is permanent.

You're making those two bets no matter what currency you're dealing with.  Everything is a speculation.  If you buy a stock with USD, you're also betting that the growth of the company value will outpace the growth of the dollar.  Otherwise it would have made more sense to just keep your USD.
Of course, it just depends what you value.  If all you want is a percentage of the company no matter how it does, you'll never need to see the price again as you'll own that share in the company forever*.  If you value USD, it makes more sense to measure shares in USD.  Same goes for any other purchase mechanism.  
It only makes sense to measure shares in BTC if you value BTC and that is your ultimate goal.  But if you value BTC, at this stage in its development you're speculating on it already no matter what you do.  And you absolutely need to make the decision if the company's growth is going to exceed the growth of what you're putting in.

First, I want to say thank you for breaking the mold on these type of opinion posts.  Typically they seem to be written as a statement of fact, and I really appreciate your framing the topic as a call for change rather than telling people what they should/shouldn't do.  I feel this opens up discussion a lot more.
As a premise, I feel the root of why bitcoin was started/adopted was more in response to runaway inflation.  And I think this is why we see less of an ethos to store one's own coins surrounding bitcoin now.  But you're right, if we want the good to continue we need to demand it.  Low transaction fees and low third-party fees are the norm now because that's what the culture has spawned, and the only way that sort of thing continues is us.

In Russia, yes.  Even though you're being incredibly generous by offering 800 dollars for it.  You would have to go to an authorized currency exchange to buy rubles with your BTC (which...may not even exist at this point for all I know), then buy the coffee.  The same holds for dollars or euros.

I don't blame you.  It's redundant, and also doesn't actually have much to do with the next clause about bitcoin being a good investment.
Mentioning a current price when making a call about an investment can make sense.  But talking about a specific price at one point in time seems meaningless when you're talking about "the best investment in computer history if not human history."  
"If you buy today at 705, bitcoin is the greatest investment ever" includes extraneous words that imply that buying at a mere hundred more yesterday or tomorrow would somehow make it no longer the greatest investment.
Also, logically the idea that whether or not someone invests that day ("you" in this case) has anything to do with whether or not it's a good investment is nonsensical.  You don't have to assume anyone is buying today to talk about how good of an investment it is.  At best, it saying that in order for it to be a good investment for you, you have to invest in it.  Which is already known.
tl;dr - "assuming you were to buy today" is completely unnecessary at best and wrong at worst, "at today's panic price of $705 per coin" includes irrelevant information
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:57:21

I have an email on the leak that isn't from bitcointalk.  The way the hack works is you need to start with an email list of your own and then there's a stupidly-easy way to confirm if that person is a coinbase user. 
I would imagine the big leak was done by compiling a number of other email lists (bitcointalk, inputs.io, other btc and non-btc related sites, previously generated spam lists available elsewhere) and making the coinbase list from that.

Not necessarily, it would work the same as it does on the site.  If I'm stealing your info, and I'm prompted for a 2FA code on the real site with your credentials, I just ask you for that code in the same manner.  If you ask me to send an SMS or email, I tell the real system to send you the code (they already know where to send it if I don't), then you end up giving it to me.  If it's being generated on your phone, you just outright give it to me and I pass it along.
The only trick is when 2FA is requested, and offhand I don't know how blockchain does it.  If it's only asked for on withdrawals, then you have to wait for the user to initiate withdrawal on the spoof site which may or may not happen during that session.  If it's asked for on login, then there's no problem since handing it over immediately is what the user expects.

My point was I disagree with how fast you imply that times change.  The conversation was whether or not bitcoin can be adopted now or in the near future.  The time it takes for private companies to design, build, get approval for and implement even a country wide network using blimps and drones is not trivial.  
Saying in general that technology will continue forward and spread over time is like saying the sun is going to set.  Of course it's going to happen.  But this is clearly a case of trying to put the cart before the horse.
Edit:  And you might say that an internet-based bitcoin project can be implemented simultaneously to these things.  This is true, but only to a limited extent in most cases.  If you don't know for sure how people will have access, whether it be facebook/google's projects or something completely different, you can't adequately make any plans or do much more than get the word out about the basic concept.

To put it another way, they'd be making 1.5x coins during a week of lower difficulty, then 0.5x during a period of higher, they'd still make 1x average.
I mean, it's a great idea for them.  Mine more coins all at once for less electricity.

If bitcoin spikes in value, the share price will probably go down.
Say I'm a coin mining company, and difficulty never increases.  I mine 100 coins a week, every week.  One share will be worth X btc.  Since my btc income is constant regardless of the value of a btc, if btc price surges my share price will stay the same in btc.
But say I sell anything else.  My income will be based on the value of the item I produce.  If btc value increases, I wind up with less btc because, even though I've sold the same amount, people now pay less btc for it.  *The value of my shares hasn't changed, but its price in btc will still go down because the value of my company hasn't increased with the value of a btc.*

What you're describing isn't really front running.  That's when you already have a buy/sell order from a client, and sneak your own in front of it to skim.  What you're talking about is more akin to insider trading, which can be done by any party (including but not limited to mtgox) with non-public knowledge such as a news leak.

People went into reading JP Morgan's report assuming it was an attack.  Now this article is doing even worse.  First thing I think is wrong from this article:


There is a section called "Bitcoin as inferior money."  It comes immediately after a section titled "Bitcoin as better money" which everyone seems to ignore.  The JPM reports lists what it finds as pros and cons.  
The summary of the "inferior" section - As a medium of exchange, they say it's no different from fiat except it has the hurdle of acceptance.  As a store of wealth and unit of account, the current volatility makes it worse than fiat.  Volatility which they acknowledge could just be a result of it being new (and they even write that in bold).  
Their argument is that, as a currency as defined by those three things, it is *currently* inferior.  This doesn't seem unreasonable, given that they still acknowledge bitcoin's appeal in the "better money" section.


That doesn't occur from what I read.  There are no predictions to what will happen to bitcoin.  The closest they come to making a prediction is saying the chances are low it becomes as widespread as legal tender, but the price will climb as high as demand can carry it.  The closest they get to a recommendation is saying it's "worth limiting exposure to," as in, treat it like a risky asset.
The quote this article uses immediately after about "paper money" is from an unrelated section where JPM is literally defining fiat currency and not extolling fiat supremacy like the usage of that quote would imply.


I really can't find anything in the report talking about anything else besides how bitcoin compares.  So there really isn't anything I can refute. Since it seems like, for the rest of the article, the author is writing against an argument that was never really made in the first place.
tl;dr - Audacity isn't an insult.

*"Did Mr. Andreessen share this strong view with Mr. Donahoe?"*  Sure dude, I'm sure the rest of the board said they were looking to sell off shares, and Andreessen just said, "Well, gee guys, I *guess* I'll buy it off you even though I don't really wanna I suppose...*shucks*...."
If anything, the whole Andreessen section reads like study on why he's been correct more than the rest of the board/CEO, effectively making the case for why they should hold on to him as tightly as possible.

"Getting started" and "buying" bitcoin are two different things.  Get started by getting yourself a wallet (aka figure out how you're going to store these things), and getting familiar with some minimal security measures if not relying on an online service.

It's pretty great for bitcoin, which currently has no guaranteed interest generating offerings.  The low number also keeps the system running a lot longer, and doesn't scream "scam" as much as something like 20%.
In this regard, it's interesting to note that the daily interest rate is being adjusted down from 0.016 to 0.01, and max deposit is being raised from 999 to 10,000.  Pay out less, take in more.  It's a smart strategy to keep the system rolling farther.  Hopefully it signals to people that they're going to get burned though.

There's no reason to assume, at any stage of betting, that the odds are 50:50.  New information about the hashrate comes with time, while the prediction point doesn't change.  The site's prediction point makes no claim to being a 50:50 chance even from the start of betting.  
I'm certain we're on the same page here on how gambling works.  If people feel there is a 1/2 chance for a side to lose, it's definitely stupid to accept 1/11 odds.  But if people determine there is a 1/100 chance one side will win (maybe halfway through the day new info comes and we find out some pools crash), it's fine to accept 1/11 odds against it.  
In fact, it's even beneficial.  If you add that much to the pool, it makes it harder for more people to come in and dilute your bet.  Ideally, you want to add so much to the pool that it's not worthwhile for anyone else to bet your side (which would reduce your payout and affect your payout odds) while still balancing the bet/payout with what you feel are the odds of winning.
I do agree that the payout calculator is completely incorrect.  To the point of absurdity.

I'm afraid there are people with much, much more optimized and specialized mining setups, that make the amount of coins you would mine negligible.
There are a number of places where you can buy coins with paypal.  localbitcoins.com has a number of sellers who accept paypal.  However, with paypal's very buyer-friendly policies, there are few that will sell coins worth more than a few hundred USD.
If you want bitcoin, now's a fine time to buy.  If you're looking to use them, you might as well buy as soon as you need them.  If you're looking to speculate, no one has a time machine so no one can say for sure what will happen to the value.
Some people do this type of buying on one exchange to sell on another.  This type of exploitation of a price difference is called "arbitrage."  Normally people will do this immediately if there was nothing stopping them.  In this case, it takes a long time to withdraw money from mtgox, enough so that for many people it is not worth holding up $900 of their own dollars to make $200.
In addition to the localbitcoins.com mentioned before, and the other exchanges you mentioned, coinbase is also a popular option.

The amount in each pool is advertised.  If there's only 1 BTC to win, it's your own fault for betting 100 BTC against it if you think that's too risky.
Also, the odds aren't meant to be 50-50.  It's like you're betting on a sports outcome.  But instead of getting paid on 3:1 or 2:5 odds as the casino dictates, you're betting against crowdsourced odds based on how others think of the outcome.
The site works to a certain threshold based on popularity.  You can't make a 60,000 BTC bet on just-dice right now.  Is its bankroll too small to work?  Picking 100 as your threshold for whether or not a site can't work is arbitrary.

Let's get the semantics out of the way first.  Bitcoin isn't a bubble just like a house isn't a bubble.  Each have a worth, but the monetary value of these things can go through bubbles, where the current value is artificially inflated beyond an intrinsic value through hype or other factors.
Take this quote from the article:


The author contends this isn't a "bubble" because the price eventually rose again.  The only problem is bitcoins weren't worth 32 dollars *at that time*.  There were much fewer merchants accepting them.  Wallet software and exchanges weren't as fleshed out and accessible.  They simply weren't as useful.
This is like arguing that Apple was always intrinsically a multi-billion dollar company even when it was just a few guys in a garage.  Would you have paid $500 for a share in a publicly-traded Apple in 1980 (accounting for splits, etc.)?  Of course not, because there's always a time element involved.  The potential future of anything should certainly be included in its present value, but the amount of time it takes to reach that potential should be considered against it.
Like the author says, bubbles can only be reliably judged in hindsight.  We'll only know if the intrinsic value of bitcoin **today** is higher or lower than the current price over time.  Is the current price mostly indicative of the word getting out and people buying into the idea and the utility, or is it mainly people buying out of hype?  We won't really know for a while.

When I say 50% chance, I mean that if a trillion addresses were randomly generated per second, there's still a 50/50 shot that none of them match each other in 10 billion years.  Not just a targeted address.
For a one in a quadrillion chance that any two randomly generated addresses match if a trillion are generated per second, it's under a decade.  But that's fine.  If every ten years there's only a 1 in a quadrillion chance that two addresses match, that's completely reasonable.  If there were a lottery with those same odds held every decade since the dawn of man, and the current world's population played it every time, it probably wouldn't have been won yet.

I honestly didn't see it as negatively as you saw it.  Let me go through and respond to your points how I saw them.
The present tense is meant to be understood as being true at that time period.  They are subject to hacking and were stolen, to say anything else is dishonest.  The first instances of theft are important.  Not just because they could be stolen, but also that they were worth stealing.


The price of a bitcoin isn't mentioned *anywhere*, except when discussing the large bubble (and indirectly in the purchase of a pizza).
Speaking of the pizza, it is not explicitly stated there either why the time point is a milestone.  In every entry, good and bad, it's left for the reader to infer why it was important.  It's abridged, after all.


You could also interpret this entry that the ATM complies with regulations and laws of its home country.  I mean, if you just include one extra word there it becomes "curb money laundering and other fraud."
The article is sorely lacking in any mention of merchants and organizations using the currency legitimately, which is a huge misstep but also difficult to sum up in one entry in the past.  But beyond that, it's not negative.  It just doesn't go apeshit with praise and call it things like "disruptive wave of the future."  Even though the second sentence calls it a breakthrough in transactions.
It's not meant to be positive either, or negative.  It's the story of bitcoin still growing despite anything negative, and the major positive things that have happened to push that forward.

Malware can get in through exploits in your browser and its add-ons (such as java or flash).  Typically these exploits allow it to get around asking for permission to install.  But some malware does request permission and uses these exploits to disguise itself as something legitimate.  Some malware doesn't use these flaws, and is completely dependent on the user installing it mistakenly.
Malware can potentially be picked up at any website, from that website code itself or through from an advertisement displayed on that website supplied by a third party.

Theoretically, you only earn interest on your own money.  It would be closer to a drug dealer specifically paying interest on a loan to a bank, which the bank would then pay to you as interest on your own account.  The FBI could probably go after all funds paid on that loan from the bank, including interest.  They just wouldn't be able to identify if some of that interest went to you.
For Visa, the transaction fee would technically be paid by the store as a service.  If a dealer paid $100 to the store, Visa might get $3, the store would have $97, then the FBI would just take $100 from the store.  It can't prove what the store did with an individual dollar from the transaction.
In the situations you describe, the money is just too fungible to go after precise units.  I was saying this because it's a pretty unique scenario.  Every fraction of a coin is identifiable and can be traced on the blockchain.  And it's more unique because they're actually using seized funds to pay for the transfer of seized funds.

Yeah, and the reverse is true too of course; an unreasonable parent would view a reasonable child as unreasonable.  But while there are plenty mature and reasonable 14 year olds out there, they are going to be in the minority (and especially unlikely if their parents are unreasonable/setting a bad example).
Basically, kids come up with bad ideas all the time because they don't yet know any better, and the parent has to rule on it with whatever information they have.  They won't always be right, but in the general case they'll be right more often.  Which makes "disobey them because some guy on the internet is BOOM dropping logicbombs" a bad idea.

Well technically, mining (the most common definition) can't stop ever or else we'd have no transactions.  I think it's important to distinguish between "mining" and "creating new coins."
Also, transaction fees won't necessarily outpace block reward.  Bitcoin may no longer be as popular, and there might not be as many transactions.  But that will just mean mining will scale back until there are few enough people to where it's worthwhile for those few to do so.    Even if a single coin becomes nearly worthless and there are zero transactions, there will be someone with free electricity who has an incentive to mine every block.  It's a nice equilibrium.

We Use Coins is there now, so you may have affected change already.  It also looks like bitcoin.it has now been explicitly labeled "Bitcoin Wiki" instead of simply "bitcoin.it", which is helpful.
I also don't think it's possible to explain how to buy bitcoins in an easier manner than the buy bitcoins link that's been there, the info may be a little stale but for the most part can be followed with little correction.

It would be if they were saying that, but instead they're purposefully circumventing paypal's policies.  With bitcoin payment you know what you're getting.  Paypal is a service, and they're taking away an aspect of that service for their own profit, like a store refusing to honor a warranty that the manufacturer has mandated as a requirement to sell the product in the first place.
And since a big part of their business model seems to be "we accept paypal for bitcoins" that could come crashing down pretty quickly if paypal decides to care that someone's trying to sneak around their buyer protection.  We all know they're not seller friendly in the first place.
Like I said before, they don't need to be using paypal if they have a problem with it.  There are plenty of other payment methods that would require trusting the merchant that don't violate any policies.  The 60-day waiting period is a bad business decision all around, which is why my opinion is to stay away.

Don't get me wrong, you have a great point.  Bitcoin has monetary value, so it's much better suited as a gift.  The Bible comparison by no means a perfect one, but in some aspects there's still some validity in it.

Assuming that I did use that, no, I still wouldn't share.  Dice/dictionary is a fine way of generating a password.  But there's no reason to say something like, "I used this list of 7000 or so words and picked 8-9 of them at random" even if it only narrows the amount of possibilities down to the same number as there are picoseconds that the universe has existed.  I take a stance that paranoia is the strongest policy in security.

A layer of trust for the producer's benefit is true of any hidden-source bitcoin product.  That doesn't have much to do with the product's concept.  I liked the concept of having bundled software specifically for an offline wallet provided on presumably clean media.  Getting trust-ably clean media, to the point where there's 0% chance of risk, is pretty involved.  And the OP was pretty open to discussing the trust issue.  You might have seen it if people hadn't blacked out when they saw the price and started downvoting everything he had to say.
The price was too high for anyone commenting, myself included.  But most people here would also already know how to make the wallet themselves.  For people who know nothing, or for a large institution looking to secure a large amount of coins, the price may well be worth it to them.  Convenience always carries a premium, after all.  But this doesn't have much to do with the idea itself either.  If it's something people would use if free or cheap, it doesn't stop being inherently useful if the price rises.

~~Reward is fixed, sort of. It's mainly the difficulty that changes.~~  The difficulty changes based on mining with the goal of keeping reward halving around every four years, or new blocks every ten minutes.  For example, when the 15750000th bitcoin is mined, the reward will drop to 12.5 whenever that happens.  Difficulty adjusts so that will happen on schedule to mitigate increases and decreases in the amount of mining occurring.  
Transaction fees are (more or less) market set, the total of which are simply number of transactions * average fee paid.  Fewer transactions = fewer fees per block paid.

First, wicketr didn't say "Ulbricht" but DPR, and I think it's pretty factual that whoever that moniker describes presided over SR and therefore a ton of illegal activity.  
You can choose not to believe the evidence that this person is DPR if you wish, even though apprehending this person led to the shutdown of SR and the seizure of a fuckton of coins.  
You can also choose not to believe that the person known as DPR tried to contract a murder, even though the logs appear real, is corroborated by other circumstance, and illegal activity involving tons of money often turns violent.  That's fine, honestly the contract thing is minor in this context.

I think the original point isn't quite refuted from that, it's just at the point where people take electricity for granted.  Everything that computers or the internet have done wouldn't be possible without electricity but it's just a given at this point.
But I do still agree with you that a derivative technology can be more disruptive than its predecessor.  I think when people say disruptive, they mean the time it takes for that thing to develop and foment serious change.  Electricity took a while, whereas the internet took only a couple decades.  Bitcoin could be under a decade.

It is the most "internet" advertisement I've ever seen.  Essentially in image macro format, requires knowledge of honey badger meme.  In terms of market segmentation, its style is probably targeting the right demographic.  Early, very tech-savvy adopters are in, and I think it makes sense to branch out to the heavily internet-connected, somewhat technically inclined young crowd who may not have heard of (or are on the fence about) bitcoin.  It's an easier transition than, say, jumping straight to your grandmother who still has AOL, and you're more likely to gain traction with a group that's already buying and selling goods online.
I do agree that the execution could have been a little better, but I'm not a marketer nor a graphic designer so I can't speak to how to improve it.  But I do think that it has enough appeal to a key demographic to be considered worthwhile.

Astrology is based upon astronomical events (and, I guess, magic or something).  In context, the word astronomical was used correctly here.  Astronomical events are what are supposed to cause astrological effects.

Why, what's wrong with, instead, taking the initiative and actualizing a straight-shooting paradigm that reduces mining entitlements while augmenting user satisfaction and value?

I apologize, but I'm afraid I don't feel comfortable sharing that after admitting to the world that my wallet has been uploaded and floating around somewhere, as I don't consider my reddit account anonymous.  But to sort of answer, I keep up with brute force methods and try to maintain passwords that counteract such methods to a level that I am comfortable with.

The logic in spending X^\* USD to get X USD is fine when you say the miner will "pay for itself" rather than "get me more btc for my usd." You never had 2 btc or 1 btc to start with.  It's not a loss, just a missed opportunity. 
Maybe I could have bought 10 ltc for $2, then bought 3 btc with it.  Would that mean buying straight btc is now a loss?  Maybe I could have purchased 200 namecoin, then bought 20 ltc, then bought 6 btc.  There are an infinite number of possibilities, it doesn't mean that not finding the absolute best one is a loss, just that money has been left on the table.
As long as I end up with $2 at the end then it's paid for itself.  When you are talking about something "paying for itself", the only way for that statement to make sense is by measuring it by the initial cost in the initial units.  Otherwise nothing can ever pay for itself.
^\* (Let's call "X" miner+all associated costs, e.g. electricity)

People.  Particularly people who suck at investing and dive into things they don't understand at all, and parrot ideas they've heard others talk about.
Of course, this isn't going to stop the true believers out there from taking this silly internet sketch as a slap in the face and writing a long-winded diatribe that makes them sound as dumb as the guy in the video.

Some are claiming that people are upvoting the post due to relevance rather than necessarily agreeing with it.  But if people were truly upvoting based on relevance rather than opinion, the same would hold when voting your comments - and how could the comments of a mod/submitter be irrelevant to the topic at hand?
On many posts, the trend is often that people who agree have nothing to add, so they upvote or ignore and move on, while people who disagree go to the comments.  But honestly, there's no way of knowing the motivations of people's voting en masse on either the post itself or any of the comments.
Since you're a moderator, I doubt I'm saying anything new to you.  My main point is, when you do go to discuss the results later, I humbly ask that you try not to infer too much from the voting and commenting here, and to solicit both praise and critical comments in a later discussion thread if you do want feedback.  And if you do want to rely on a vote, to not rely on the reddit system where visibility/being top comment will affect things.

Satoshi's objective then.  And all the people buying it with the hopes of spending it.  It's even in the title of the original white paper.
Honestly, this objection is like arguing against someone saying that a bill or law has an objective to fight a certain crime.  Yes, it's only just words on a paper, and maybe sometimes the law will enable something originally unintended.  But the creator of the law and the community that implements it gives it an objective.  This is just a semantic argument that takes the word way too literally.

It gives your customers more options.  If you have no interest in holding bitcoin, it's still good for business and customer service.
It's not like anyone likes paying a percentage of income to credit card companies, but they still offer the option because it's a good business move in many cases.

The problem is people keep making comments about not taking their pants off before pissing, so to speak.

I didn't intend to imply that *everything* is out in the open.  Just that it's open knowledge that hoarding exists, and likely to a high enough degree for the bubble potential I mentioned.

Large influx of new hardware all at once, so there's a large number of people looking to recoup cost all at once.  Makes sense to me.  Personally though, I don't think it's the only, or even the main, factor.

If you can get enough drones in your botnet, it will always be worth it.  Also depends on price of the coin.

It's not so much the worry that they remove it but rather the public narrative would become "no one actually uses bitcoin, they all just hold onto it to get rich."  Which would set things back quite a bit.

Except if those were the true points, and there was truly nuance intended, there would be no "palpable irony."  
The only time one would see irony coming into play is if making a blanket statement like "well well well, looks like paypal isn't so bad after all, stop hating on them!"  When in reality nothing's really changed, and it's easy to still call it a crappy company for a number of other reasons.  Or for a statement like "looks like bitcoin isn't so good after all!" when it still is good in a number of other aspects.  This is how I think PotatoBadger is interpreting it, and I think it's a fair rebuttal.
Or it could be another option, one which I feel is the most likely and just as unproductive.  Irony would also come in if one was making a blanket statement about one's audience. Something like "You all blindly hated everything about paypal and now you're all using it!  Irony!"
The points you list are pretty obvious statements to anyone who doesn't blindly hate paypal or blindly worship bitcoin.  And it's being demonstrated that people already understood those points; it's why people getting refunds used paypal in the first place.  People wanted a service and chose paypal as the best available provider of that service.  
So, altogether, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume OP was trying to make a grander point than what you suggest.

These are the same complaints that have been echoed by freelance developers long before bitcoin.
My only advice to bitcoin specific "entrepreneurs" - stop naming your project bit-* or *-coin.  Seriously.
