Interesting observation. PBoC announced the freezing of withdrawals on Feb 9th I believe. I don't remember a specific date that they said they would unfreeze. I think they said about a month. I remember that it conveniently coincided with the ETF decision. Have not though about this as a mechanism for a dip. 
Maybe the Chinese folks will decide to hodl. But if the ETF is denied and there is a more coin flooding the market because those people can now withdraw, could be a great opportunity for some cheap coin.

I have had questions lately about the last part of your comment. What are the exact security risks of receiving at the same address multiple times? It seems when company's or people ask for tips it is always the same address. Does using a QR code keep you from using the same address?

Well I mean what else could it be used for? Camouflaged hardware wallet and a laptop mouse. If you could get both of those to work from the same device pretty incredible. It would be weird to see someone using a mouse for something other than to move a cursor on a screen. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:48:47
Well done
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:03:46
Excellent explanation. Thank you.
edit* So it is not necessarily all one seller?

It bounced back before the first person could even make a post about it

I know you are u/glockbtc and to be honest I generally agree with the majority of your opinions. However, I will have to staunchly voice my opposition regarding this matter. Release the memes.
@_date: 2017-02-10 00:36:05
Get the toggle switch in there and have dual functionality. Also if it's possible you could encrypt access to bitcoin so even if it was stolen you would still need a personal pin or password to open the wallet. Great hiding in plain site idea.
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:26:03
Kraken, Gemini, Poloniex, Localbitcoins, and many others. Coinbase complies with KYC/AML laws so that is obviously not an issue for you. There are many exchanges to choose from, just do some DD and find out what works best for you.

Care to explain what I am watching? Not super savy with the TA. 
I see the sell order there for the 300BTC, but what is the mechanism by which it is "annihilated"? Is it one buy of 300 BTC or are smaller buys making a dent? I am not even sure I'm asking the right questions. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:25:23
My bad. Woof, it's been a long time since I've thought about leet.

If you want to see the price over the course of the last month, I think looking at any price chart is the way to go. There are no short of them posted here. I like OP's style of hitting the biggest news instead.
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:56:31
Genius in its rawest form! 
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:26:48
Look forward to this every month, well done as always. 
February was excellent for the coin. 
I think with the ETF decision still looming March will be very interesting to look back on.

Also you can create additional wallets in a single Trezor with a "25th seed word" which is just a password you come up with. These wallets do not even appear in the Trezor UI allowing for plausible deniability .
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:16:34
No worries, this is a scam the real Trezor site is buytrezor.com
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:37:56
Not sure if it has beed resolved, but as I understand it there was security issue with Jaxx a few months back. I believe your private key was somehow stored in the source code of the software. It did not make huge news at the time aside from some Shrem tweets. Someone may know more about it??
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:12:37
I am wondering the same thing. From the reading I have done breadwallet has syncing complaints from a year ago, but can't figure out why not recommended now 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:15:11
P/E comparison is completely ridiculous. They do make one good point in that article and it is that as the ways to trade in bitcoin derivatives increases that increases supply. One of BTCs strongest characteristics is the ultra limited supply. If people are out there increasing supply that is is not actually BTC but merely a representation of the underlying asset, this could be very problematic.
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:03:30
I agree. I don't see how this could have been a surprise to anyone involved if this is true. Which would help explain the recent run. Imho 5k is still a ways off. Hope I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:42:01
OP obviously expected it

Wow I have never heard of this possibility before, very scary. Who knows if the aftermath would play out like the predictions, however this seems to be a legitimate concern. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:05:51
If true, and there is a sizable correction due to sell off, it will bother me the whales still have this much influence

For a while at the end of last year my Friday nights played out like this 
-Get a little buzzed
-Start talking about bitcoin 
-Get drunker
-Won't stop talking about bitcoin 
-Buy .25 BTC in the Uber on the way home

Looking for patterns in an often irrational market. I personally think it holds a small value but certainly does not tell the whole story. 
Look at the January and March dips for example. At the time I remember seeing people posting that those were the 5th wave and yet here we are 150% higher than that value.
