Just as long as you remember that it isn't that private

You also have the forked coins as well like Bitcoin Cash. What are you going to do with that?
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:23:22
If you owned BTC through Aug 01, 2017; then you have equal amounts of Bitcoin Cash. Also there were other forks like Bitcoin Gold

Thank you. I needed that constructive criticism. Maybe tomorrow..just maybe...I'll be better

Quite the shitpost we have here. Bitcoin was suppose to be a revolution, but now it is a way to make money to buy Apple products

To maintain purchasing power, while in control of my money. Spend anonymously without my purchasing data being sold to marketers. Libertarian crypto punk ideals started this, but has became something else

A local transaction with someone with Bitcoin to sell
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:44:29
Coinbase is insured. Even that exchange?

This is a fake screenshot! Right now Bitfinex is the largest by volume at 10%
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:22:25
Some say hold, but I think they secretly sell

Free money?

Like a debit card. When you swipe, it pays the merchant in the currency they accept (e.g. USD), then it sells some of your crypto assets to cover it. All automatically

How about now?
@_date: 2016-02-21 03:12:50
I don't understand why jumps are so important to everyone. DON'T treat it like a stock, but a currency that needs stable value. Not upward or downward volatility 
@_date: 2016-02-22 05:33:30
Even insured services like Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-09-20 02:48:56
What issues would arise from doing so?
@_date: 2016-09-20 03:23:05
Thanks for the insight. I'd hope, if they were just making assumptions, that they would at least reach out to him/her
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:07:10
Bitcoin ATMs too?

Is Looney a new ICO? Where can I buy
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:47:51
Agreed. Can we even call this a dip?
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:14:35
Currency and money can both be described simply as a medium of exchange. 
Cigarettes in prison take a form of currency.

No FB friend status requirement. They offer a few field types to find someone, and there is no requirement once found.

I was about to look at historical prices and compare to past auctions, but if this research has all ready been done I'll just hold off. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:46:12
You only make it until you sell.

You should have given him the coinbase referral link. $10 BTC for you and them

It is not largely printed,  but the FED purchases bonds from companies and banks. That money is then put in a bank where it is lended out creating an increase in the money supply.  
Government gets money by the FED purchasing US T Bills. Electronic money is....created I suppose.

It doesn't mention a gambling platform.

Is your target market, and advertising dollars, being focused on the BTC and LTC communities? 
@_date: 2015-10-31 09:22:32
Yes, the episode when that FBI tech guy has to steal money from a random account and make it untraceable while Reddington has a gun to his head. Bitcoin was one of the steps.

Making like-minded people aware of documentary they may enjoy? 
Raise awareness to the jailed owner?
