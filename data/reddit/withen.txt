So you had 1.5 BTC and yet still saving for a hard W????
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:58:45
I was referring to BItcoin. It's coming down hard... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:21:26
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:22:51
I would say the price has dropped quite consistently since the 20k....
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:10:49
Exactly why bitcoin has very little mainstream utility other than storage.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:50:46
Supply &amp; Demand
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:40:25
Please tell me hands down that you don't think the recent surge is driven by mass hysteria and speculation? As opposed to people tanking and believing the ideology itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:10:40
I Got of the train at 16k..... However lots of fools were lined up to jump aboard. The last fools on the train will lose the game...  
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:28:28
Thats not major... Wait and See..  You'll know what major is
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:07:27
Whats your gut feeling..... If it were the latter.... The price wouldn't be dropping consistently.... It would be rising...
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:09:42
Ahh ok sorry forgot is at 23k now..... Good luck and happy New Year
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:55:35
2~4000 by the end of 2017
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:33:37
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:30:34
Right now is a good time..... The frenzy will blow over... Value will normalize.... If you honestly think 1 BTC is 16k worth then hold it... If on the other hand you acknowledge the fact that a main stream media frenzy has driven the latest rise..... You know what to do...��
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:28:41
And Thats what most don't realize. It has very little utilisation value other than trading and storing.....  
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:23:10
Trust your gut......  All the hype aside, what do you honestly think it represents in actual monetary value as we speak.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:40:14
That's gonna be fun when future self orders a coffee for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:56:34
Are you serious????
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:56:47
2~4000 by new years
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:39:01
Returning loans based on gambling is probably the dumbest thing ever..... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:54:00
It wont
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:27:03
Sell them would be an option
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:54:25
Whats that 1
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:09:08
This is not "a dip" it's spelt "major correction"
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:20:29
Bitclub is a Ponzie scam....   
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:46:25
That was not panicking... That was rationality setting in.✅
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:15:54
Well it's not gold either
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:34:34
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:05:06
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:02:45
Which is currently impossible
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:17:17
   When people start selling out
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:34:23
It's gonna drop far more this year
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:34:56
It's a scam..... Devide the mined blocks with total amount of users.... Which they won't tell you for some"odd" reason
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:19:05
Much easier to buy crypto than to sell it.... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:32:09
Its a beautifully orchestrated scam
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:34:07
And worthless
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:06:32
Sorry for beeing noobious 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:44:37
Why 100K? I dont See the point....Thats not holding Thats Trading.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:47:14
Thats exactly what is worrying here....
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:24:07
Exodus Does not have your keys
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:51:47
So you think "the dip" has ended
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:41:23
Go for a cool million
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:41:18
Ha ha ha ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:15:43
Whats your main argument for HODLING? What's your end game?
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:42:17
Are you serious?????-
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:01:49
John McAffee is also a very stable individual
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:33:37
People rushing to exchanges to cash out... They bought in on the hype and realized it's an entirely different game to cash out again..... Hence the drop will continue
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:16:49
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:50:56
Wait until the new year
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:14:32
Not a stock but the majority of buyers right now have no idea what they are buying. Hence purchasing based on mass hysteria.... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:47:17
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:42:43
No we already have useful value deposits. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:53
Two people... Wow were in for a ride now
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:28:07
Most newcomers do not buy on exchanges but directly from a wallet ie. Blockchain..... To sell from these you need also an exchange account to transfer to.... Hence the flooding of exchanges as we speak.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:37:59
Some Say the new gold..... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:20:22
Yaaaawwwwnnnnn
