Your comment makes absolutely no sense at all.   The last peak was Dec of 2017. BEFORE THAT, the last peak was Dec of 2013.   So the peak bagholders of Dec 2013 had to wait 4 YEARS for the next peak.  They also had to wait 3 years and 2 months to get back in the black.  Why don't you do yourself a favor, and just stop.   It's only been 9 months.  Seriously.  Just.  Stop.

OK you sons of guns, I bought the dip!  I still think it's going to test 6000, maybe more.  Perhaps not this plunge, but at some point.  I think we're at least 12 months away from the Next BIG Leg Up.  If we see a global economic contraction at any point during that 12 months, then all bets are off, we could be holding multi\-year.  But that's why it's called investing, not gambling. \(though it's really all gambling, even investing, hahaha\)

We'll conduct an experiment.  You will be the proud owner of a bitcoin wallet engraved on a pure iron medallion, with 100btc on it.  Mine will be the same except gold.  The experiment necessitates that we bury them for 10 years, then we can dig them up.  Afterwards, someone will have a number of lambos parked in a multi-million facility. The other will be revisiting basic chemistry  when all he finds is a reddish brown powder, where the medallion used to be...  I mean seriously, there's a _reason_ why NASA shot a gold plated disk into space that was meant to last millions of years.

If the general markets take a shit, and there's a global recession, bitcoin is going to track with that recession.  I really hope that doesn't happen.  I'm a buyer, I'd like to see $5k btc for a time, to do some more bargain shopping, but I don't want $5k-ish because we're going into a global recession.  If that happens, we'll see $2k or $3k, and it'll take years to see the next peak.

Losses are inevitable.  It's part of the game.  The only way to have zero losses, is to not play.  Even tried and true stock market strategies all incur losses.   All risk/reward ventures entail losses.  Short players have an important role keeping the market honest. But they take losses just like everyone.  It's about managing for the long term. And looking far enough out.   Keep diversified.  For people with small amounts of capital, their best investment is themselves.  Earn, and save.  Earn, and save.  The nice thing about  being young, is that you can take $500, or $1000, and put it into something like bitcoin when it comes along. Maybe it'll pay off. But if you lose it, it doesn't even represent a drop in bucket of a lifetime of earnings.  Just don't make it a habit to buy at 20k, and sell at 5k.  ;-)

Look peeps.  We're near the bottom.  But "near" is relative. For people who haven't spent one penny on btc, when the height of insanity was 20k, and now we're at 6k, "near" could be $4500.  And that would be correct from their perspective.   Even $3500, could be near.  Or Maybe $6000 is the actual floor by consensus.  Who the hell knows?  For those who bought high, then "near" will never be near enough, as we continue to look for the floor.   I've already taken losses larger than most average people.  The only thing I'm worried about is a game changer, that could impact all of crypto currency.   A technological breakthrough, a new tech that surpasses the current one completely, or a flaw found in the foundation, or maybe a global economic contraction of the biblical kind.  That's what I get a bit concerned about.  Not the price floor seeking.  Let the sumbeech go to 4000.  I'll just buy some more.  It'll help with my earlier losses.  It also gives opportunity to people with lesser means when the price drops.  Patience is the word.  We could be riding the floor, plus or minus 15 percent for a long long time.This is not a new pattern...

The reason prices go up and down is humans being human.  We don't really need something real to collapse a bubble.  Yea, go ahead and bring in some bad news, and we'll fit it into the narrative, and drop the price some more.  Even with age old, legitimate, markets that are influenced by hard data, people still don't need a good goddamn reason to send the price plunging, or soaring to the sky.  I'm not saying hard data doesn't do it's thing, it doesn't hurt to have it reflected in the price, but it isn't necessary.  You're mentioning of the nonsense, which is correct, and reflected in my opinion above, is, in itself, just more nonsense.  And that's OK.   I guess we needed to break a certain number of comments today or you needed to "hear yourself talk".  So you posted some drivel.  I responded with some drivel, in kind.

Then someday, it'll be off and running, and everyone will be on fire, waiting for the sprint to the mainline.

@_date: 2018-11-19 20:06:49
Why would you not expect this?  It's simple math.  We have plenty of examples of bubbles to look at, crypto and non-crypto.  Looking at the bubbles that had a recovery and another run, we can look for mean/average/patterns.   I sent out an email to a few close friends, laying out the case for BTC being a buy, post 2017 bubble, between $2500 and $6000.    And the $6000 would be highly optimistic as a bottom.  And $2500 being if a global economic down turn coincided with crypto problems and fundamentals.  I figured $3800 was a good buy in.  Then I saw this subreddit, and omg, the stupidity, and utter ignorance, and non-reasoned, non-logical, full-on-emotional discourse that substituted for debate.   Anyway, the early (months ago) dip to 6k, and then the follow up touchdowns to 6k-ish, formed an unlikely pattern that when adding in the weird volumes and defiance of solid high-percentage predicted elliot wave moves,  I knew that 6k was a total farce, and the judgment day for btc would be much harsher due to the systemic widespread propping up of the price, for countless months.  This is because there's not really a large/diverse enough number of crypto holders.  And the chart distortion shows it.  The whales, the infrastructure players (miners, nvidia, datacenters, etc), the exchanges,   ....they're all desperate for price and volume increases.  Without those increases, the consequences would be dire.  They had every reason to prop up the price.  Exchanges (not just crypto but all exchanges, gold, sheep, stock markets) are notorious for some really fucked up behavior, the smaller ones tend to bury themselves, because they get caught up in the spread during the down turn and increased volatility.  So look around, everyone and their mother made their crypto plans based on the absolute most optimistic numbers, and had no plan if things did not go that way.  This is where the weak are going to be shaken out.  The real shake out is just beginning.

I think bitfinex is showing the symptoms of an exchange that will eventually bite the dust.  I'm probably wrong on this one, but still.  The weird banking issues, suspending cash deposits at times, having people complain their money disappeared or is missing, the once in a while slow pays, and that $200 premium.... sure seems like that is a symptom of them eating their own dog food, and other problems.  Like I said, I'm probably wrong, but if they go tits up in the next 3 years, it'll just be another example of a trading entity showing all the little signs early on, but they are explained away,  and/or ignored.

My guess is that the moment the ETF kicks in, it'll be another avenue for shorting in the near/mid term.    It's coming.   I posted a few weeks back that paper/digital markets are vulnerable right now, and we're starting to see a clearer picture of a future global recession staring to form.  The recession may be 18 or 24 months off, hell even 36 months, but it'll get priced into global equities markets way before it actually hits the street.  
Depending on the timing, we could see a jaw dropping correction coming to the world markets, and crypto currency will track with it.  It's already tracking with it.    
So if the world's equities and commodities markets take a 33&amp; kick to the nutz, so will crypto.   Imagine 66&amp; X $5000.   Of course 99.9&amp; of the people in these forums think in terms of absolute dollars, not percentages.  "Bitcoin lost $15,000, so what's another $2500?" mentality.  
People with large sums of BTC, can't sustain repeated 10 &amp; 15&amp; shocks, over and over.  You're better off selling, taking the cash, and buying some hard assets when there's blood on the streets of the world's markets, instead of riding crypto all the way down to $2500 a coin.  Why would a guy with 10 million in crypto watch $9000/coin go to $3500/coin, knowing full well the global economy could start to heavily price in a future contraction any month now?  This is why the recovery isn't bouncing back in the expected time frame, or with the expected vigorousness.
