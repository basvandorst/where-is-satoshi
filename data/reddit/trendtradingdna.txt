Well there is a solution for your trouble, stay away from this analysis and turn back to your hocus pocus magic you are living now.

If it doesn't break above the 8000 level sure it is a possibility

Yes you can post your opinion about the gardening. Trading is not for you.

Yes I am trying to make you billionaires but unfortunately since you think TA is not working you will make billions from gardening

Bitcoin is a trading instrument and applying TA is up to individual. When you burn your fingers trading it you will come back to read TA. Until then keep your opinion to yourself

My view was simple and clear and with the levels explained in details and already in play. When you want to give a different view you need to expose arguments not some futuristic projections, because bitcoin is a trading instrument it is not some distant planet in a deep space. That goes for all of you so called crypto experts, get to the ground, now your instruments are in the hands of the market.

I do not know then why are you discussing here your thing 
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:32:20
Then please do not speak in terms of much higher prices. Your wishes and reality are two different things. If you need some mentoring in trading and all of the other crypto traders send me a DM

Do a little thinking if fiat money collapse in what monetary terms you would express value of BTC for transactions? The fiat money will never collapse it will only change its shape and expression

If the petrodollar collapse the whole world would collapse then BTC won’t matter
