If anyone has additional needs/wants, please add on. It'd be cool to know what functions other apps include or should include

I downloaded the app and I want to use this app, but some things I NEED before I can start. 
N.B. I also included a list of things that would be nice, but not necessary for me to start using the app.
- Option to add/view holdings in different currencies. (Ex. Buying ETH in USD and then selling ETH for anySHILL, I tried changing currencies but that changes currencies for all holdings and not what I need.)
- Tracking prices from more exchanges (I personally only trade using Binance (no. 1 volume exchange) or GDAX (used by Coinbase, also biggest in US))
- Option to go through tutorial again
- If ^^, possibly making tutorial modular so I can choose which screen's functions I want to go through
- Making a subreddit to interact with users &amp; organize feedback
- If ^^, edit this post and include subreddit link
- Possibly add in-app hyperlinks/icons to social media/email/website/etc.

I might not know much about portfolio/crypto-graph apps (I use delta and haven't looked into many others), but I'm going to try it out because I'm a fan of the news and community functions - which I haven't seen in other crypto-tracking apps. 
I think reddit is a good marketing tactic bro, and I think it'll definitely stick as long as you actively improve it &amp; keep interacting with your audience. Good job!
