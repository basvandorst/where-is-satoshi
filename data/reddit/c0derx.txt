The thing I'm curious about is how can they 'ban' bitcoin ? 
How can you ban something that people are trading independently ? 
Surely it cannot be legal for a government to just say "oh people are trading that thing, now it's banned" , it's not a dangerous substance, it's just a thing ... a digital thing at that. 
I honestly don't understand (maybe I'm stupid) how they can ban something like bitcoin, if we all just decided to start trading in staples could they ban staples ?

Desktops are the biggest target for virii / malware, if you leave an unpatched XP computer online for about 3 hours it will be riddled. 
Most malware / virus creators don't target servers because they are difficult to crack, much less change of a system admin clicking on something they shouldn't or downloading a random program that contains the virus, that's not to say it doesn't happen, but it isn't any where near as common as a windows desktop being infected. 
It is so much easier to target desktops than anything else. To be specific windows desktops, they usually have the most flaws in their security as being the most common there are a large number of people who don't really know how to protect themselves or even use the computer properly. 
Linux users tend to have a bit more know how other wise they wouldn't be using linux.
I do subscribe to the idea that linux is safer than windows, not through any one being better just a matter of popularity, like I said, most target the low hanging fruit which is most cases is a windows machine that has little security or a user who can be baited into clicking a link / opening a file.

That's something I was not aware of, I thought the bank would have to be involved or knowingly assist in the fraud. I would have thought there was regulation in place to ensure cannot be liable for their customers actions, clearly there isn't.

Eventually the idea is to not change it to FIAT at any stage though. It's only changed to FIAT now because you cannot spend bitcoin everywhere. 
With more adoption we will see less conversion between the two.

Just keep in mind the only reason it's been unbanned is because of the new sub that doesn't ban ANY of the keywords that are still currently banned on the technology sub.

Love to see more merchants using crypto coins, btc ltc and hopefully vert  soon. I like to spend my coin, and I like it even more if I don't have to muck around trading to 3 different coins and trading for USD into paypal and then spending it.

I mentioned bitcoin to my tax agent and they said it's irrelevant to my tax return, so I guess take it  up with H&amp;R block. There is no specific law here that recognises bitcoin or any crypto currency as currency or property. 
The only time questions could be asked is if I cashed in a whole lot and ended up with a few hundred thousand or million in unexplained money in my bank account, it would have to be converted to FIAT before it would even be looked at. 
In Australia we can hold / mine / trade crypto and none of it is taken into account until you transfer it into FIAT, and even then it would have to be a significant amount before questions were asked. It also seems like tax agents are not interested in dealing with it.

Some people just don't understand it all straight away, they tend to get whatever wallet is first on the download list. If they have the lite wallet then it won't bother them, but if they like many I know grab the QT wallet then they will be downloading the entire blockchain. It may not be practical but it's common among people who don't really know much about it.  (I tried to get some friends into mining doge, but because cgminer is flagged as malware in avast they totally gave up and won't touch crypto now because they think it's a "virus", no amount of explanation undoes the damage that the one little "malware detected" box did). 
IF you want increased adoption you can't just say use linux, it needs to be fixed. 
Looks like the fix will have to be on MSE side anyway.

@_date: 2014-03-10 06:30:04
There is a psychological part of it, seeing that you have 0.00141 units compared to say 1000.0 makes a difference. 
I know there is no 'real' difference, but I find lower valued coins easier to calculate, for instance with doge I know that when I see something for $10 AUD, that I could spend Ð10,000 but ask me to make that calculation in btc and I will have to resort to google. 
What exchange would you recommend that has a lower withdrawl limit than .5 btc ? 
I'm not against btc, not at all, but the above are the reasons I have not really gotten into it as much as other coins. I tend to deal in a few dollars here and there maybe 50 at most, but a lot of the places I've tried dealing in btc you have to start with hundreds. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:10:58
So it does boil down to time / money due to fraud being the primary cause. In that case it's not so bad as I originally thought. I was under the impression they just didn't like bitcoin which is where my original comments were coming from.

If the bank was saying "we will no longer extend credit or loans to bitcoin based business" that I could understand... but this ? 
I just don't understand how they can just not do business with people trading in bitcoin, even paypals methods I don't get how it can be legal. 
For instance on paypal if you buy a "bitcoin mining rig" they will suspend your account / not honour the payments, how can that be legal ?

I contacted support a few hours ago about the whole passport only ID allowed from Australia, but so far have gotten no reply.

I think really go with whatever, android is great, it lets you do what you want with it. 
I've never understood why people are so infatuated with iphones, yes they do what they do very well, but you can only really do what apple wants you to do with them. 
For instance, on the iphone if I have a .rar file i can't plug it into my pc and just drag and drop the file into the phones hdd, with android I can, with apple I can't just copy paste music / movies onto the phone hdd I have to use itunes. 
Itunes is one of the worst interfaces I've ever used, hardly anyone but the most tech savvy know how to make it do what they want. 
anyway... before I get carried away... basically anything android is good.

Most people creating malware and virii are targeting the low hanging fruit. Linux provides a tougher target so is generally overlooked, it is also not the most popular desktop OS so again not the biggest target or the most profitable to target. 
(on a side not, you all know mac is UNIX right ? ) 
In saying all that, it's not hard to be secure on windows either, if you are totally paranoid then have a look at Qubes OS for something very secure and private, but again any OS can be secure if you set it up and don't do silly things.

I think I'll take my accountants advice over some random off the internet thanks. 
I can see what you are saying about capitol gains, but for instance if you purchase a product and that product becomes worth more than what you paid, then you sell it, unless you are dealing in large amounts then no one is going to want to put into a tax return, accountants included. 
It seems that this whole thing is only really relevant for people with a huge stake in it. (10's of thousands of dollars worth). 
From what you are saying the uproar is over nothing since it was all in place already . . . 
What I'm saying is that there is no provision until you actually trade it for FIAT. 
Until that time there is no way for an agent / ATO to work out how much it's worth or isn't worth. Most people in this country still don't even know what bitcoin IS let alone how to deal with it as an income / taxable property. 
Hands up who is about to calculate their bitcoin worth and hand it over to the ATO with their original spend on it ? 
@_date: 2014-04-14 04:55:05
So what you are saying is that the banks might be looking at charge backs and that kind of thing associated with bitcoin scams / people committing fraud and then the banks having to deal with transaction reversals and costs associated with that ? 
I didn't think it was illegal to not deal with something because of the above, I thought it was unreasonable and possibly illegal to shutdown accounts simply because the business is based on bitcoin. 
I don't have a grasp of the ins and outs of  banking regulation / problems with bitcoin in relation to banks which is why I am asking. 
I've googled "why don't banks want to deal with bitcoin" and mostly all I got was garbage about sticking it to the man and so on.

Simply because it's value is too high. It requires either a phenomenal investment in hardware or in the coin itself. 
I don't have 10's of thousands to throw around, to be honest I don't have 10's of dollars to throw around. 
I started mining vertcoin because my hardware is able to produce a decent return and it is resistant to asic. 
Originally my plan was to trade vert for btc but since then I've basically held it, only traded some of it for doge to buy things off stores that accept it (Ð). 
If I had the money I would invest in btc, but it's simply too rich for my blood at the moment.

It's still not really sensible to expect people to download and install a second operating system just to keep cryptocurrency. I think my above example sums it up, if a game producer did that the community would lose their minds. No, bitcoin isn't anything like a game in the way it operates or it's function, but it is a software, one that currently has an issue, regardless of if the MSE team fix it or something can be done on this side of it (don't think so) it still needs a fix.

If linux became the most popular desktop OS, you would very quickly see new malware and virii targeting it, so it is mainly a matter of being a target. 
How often do you personally go through the source code for a program ? 
I liken learning linux to be the same as learning windows if you have never used either then the learning curve is similar. 
The only time you actually need to know what you are doing through and through is if you are using something like Arch that requires you to install all the packages yourself / compile the code. 
I thought this was about vulnerability to virii / malware not backdoors put in by the manufacturer which are present in anything from OS to routers / switches / PABX systems, those issues are not a threat to the average user only companies using the hardware, your average user is not going to have issues because the NSA is spying on their porn habits ...

I can make purchases with the bitcoin and it won't affect my taxation, I know as soon as you transfer it to FIAT it can have an impact, but until that time it's totally useless to a tax agent here. 
Isn't the new 'thing' in the US about being able to tax the actual bitcoin currency itself ? (so you pay based on your btc transactions not just how much you make when you change it to FIAT). 
So really without our government having a record of the btc addresses / who owns what wallet then they have no real hope of taxing anything until it changes to FIAT. (that part I could be wrong on , but fairly sure it works that way). 
edit: I should add to the whole "purchase with bitcoin" bit by saying purchases that not really significant, like cars / houses etc. Buying a bunch of graphics cards with bitcoin isn't going to affect my tax.

That is right in a way, it's the perception, and the use as well. 
For instance I have .00234 btc stuck in an exchange because I traded a few thousand doge for it, I could withdraw the few thousand doge to my wallet, but I cannot withdraw the btc until it's .5 btc, so to use a lesser valued currency and have more units allows me to move it around much easier than if I leave it in btc. 
That was the first and last time I tried trading for btc, now I just stick with vtc / doge.
