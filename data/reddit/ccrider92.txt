What got you into it?  Just curiosity

With only a few million people, absolutely not.  We'll be thrown back to the Stone Age.  It'll be centuries before we begin trading metals again, if not millenniums.

Ahh I see.

It's an easy way to forget the importance of water...  Collapse of society, at least in my book, means about 60% gone within the first three months.  95% after a few years.

Yeah, I wouldn't wanna learn shit from you.

Everyone I know on social media was asking about cryptocurrencies during the '17 Run.  None of them care anymore, and I still HODL.

Ha.  Keep believing that.  Ammo, water, food.  But keep carrying around your heavy metal :)

So what's the point?

Your logic is awful.  Weight is weight.  The usefulness of an item determines it worth and application.  Also, you need ammo to guard anything of value.  E.g. gold, a flash drive, water etc.  Basically anything that is useful to YOU in the collapse of society.

Well, I for one spend when the price is high.  So I'm saving.

Don't just HODL, spend some and make those transactions happen!

Well actually, we have a pretty fair assumption of how much USD is in circulation.  That's why they have serial numbers.  Of course some is destroyed or lost forever but the fact remains, they do keep count of how much is out there. 
A better way of explaining your stance would be to use gold as the example since we really have no clue how much is in existence(we didn't print it like money).
