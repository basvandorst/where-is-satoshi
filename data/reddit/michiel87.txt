It is not ready for becoming mainstream just yet - it does have the potential though. 
- valuation should be stable, but that will come with a growing marketcap. If bitcoin marketcap growths x1000 times i would not expect panic reactions. But you are right until then it will be hard.
- transaction fees should be next to 0 first.
But the potential in economics is huge; no more fx costs for example which would greatly improve international business) No more banks that should be saved because they messed up (in Netherlands the state had to save 3 big banks a few years ago in order to prevent the economie from falling apart - to big to fall) 
Furthermore why should we continue to waste resources to print money?

Or it could be a disruptive technology that could change our personal finance. 
I believe crypto will become disruptive, but only time will tell.

From risk management point of view great advice! This holds for every long term investment (i do the same for EFT) sometimes you buy undervalued, sometimes you buy overvalued.
Keep in mind though, weekly buying brings more transaction costs (eft bit higher then here, but something to be aware of) 
So mine addition would be determine the buying frequence (daily, monthly or what ever) and stick to that!

37 people were denied access to Tomorrowland. The organisation based their decision on the identification of the people as a security / safety threat. Intel was provided by law enforcement. 
Many of the 37 people - including the director of Belgian BF do not have a police record other than some old traffic violations.

Why all the hate on Coinbase?
Every sub is suggesting to hold your crypto's offline - now Coinbase is transforming to offline wallet and they do not get the love they expected ��

Exactly meaning that a move from a large miner would tricker an event, right? 
Therefore they can wait till august, or they can set the correlation in motion before that. In the latter they would sell at current prices (giving them advantage). In the former they won't be able to benefit from the correction - and are exposed to quite some risks
Therefore I would expect that the correlation happens either before august or that it would not be initiated by this event..

Not sure of the correct hedge would include other cryptocurrencies. 
As all coins are pretty much depending on BTC or ETH (and even they seem to be positively correlated) - i would expect a hedge with fiat rather then with a (highly) correlated asset. Otherwise you only hedge  the exposure on one asset rather then the entire market. 
Interesting times to live in =)
