Most people have heard that college students have a lot of debt. We all feel sorry for college students.
To add insult to injury, many are offered unpaid internships. Bad corporate employers, like food corporations and libraries, cast their "net" to ensnare poor unsuspecting college students into working for free by calling the job an "internship."
I can hear that lightbulb going off in your head! A "net" that catches "interns" or in other words ........ The Internet!
We have to stop this unseamly practice for the sake of college students anywhere.

Great question. Not everyone knows what this is yet. The word "Bitcoin" is a shortened version of "Bi T Coin." 
The "coin" part represents a state of mind that can, conceptually, buy freedom, just as some would say that money can buy freedom.
The "Bi" part is for bisexual, and the "T" part is for transsexual. 
It is a well-known fact that bisexuals would really rather be transsexuals, but as a group known for chronic indecision, they are less likely than, say, tall people or redheads to take the plunge and actually become transsexuals.
When bisexuals find the strength within to become transsexuals, it can be said that they "bought the bitcoin."
If you think of it as an internet meam, it makes complete sense.
