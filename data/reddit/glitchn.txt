He wrong. Kid wants $100 worth of btc.

What makes you think they can't stop them all. They have bombs, planes,  and lots of guns, they could stop literally millions of civilians from entering if they wanted to.

Fair enough, I did do a quick search for phishing and blokkchain, didn't see any threads here. But I'm guessing the majority of people in this sub are savvy enough to know better.

Hello! I come from AND (Orlando Represent!)!
I love reddit this time of the year and seeing all of the charity going on, this is just great! Last here there was so much money donated, it was like a bandwagon effect and everyone seemed to jump on board and give a little.
Great work getting that bandwagon started this year.
Favorite game is probably Titanfall right now but tough to say. I don't have experience using bitcoin with Microsoft though, did they start accepting it for xbox live and such? It's awesome that bigger companies are adopting it. I don't have much experience with it myself, the volatility scares me too much and can't really invest. I used it once to buy a humble bundle to try out out and it was pretty cool.
Again, great work here guys!

Why can't gift cards charge for inactivity? Is it a new thing? Because I definitely recall several gift cards and prepaid visas that start talking a fee after so many years of storing it. I assumed they had to do they can avoid huge accounts payables that keep building up whenever someone leaves less than a dollar on a card and forgets about it.

Wait, you're telling me I can just google how to do something, and I'll be presented with instructions?

How would the dispensaries convert their cash to bitcoin though, if they can't open a bank account to purchase the coin with. Of course there are always in-person transactions, but that would be a huge hassle to constantly have to convert it. They wouldn't want to force users to pay in bitcoin, so I don't see how it would work.

Because someone saw the list and send some to it. Thats why it's usually going to be on the first pages.

If you just make sure you only use the network of choice (bitcoin) then you won't lose money like this. And even if you did mix the two up, so long as you are the one in control of the wallet/keys, you could recover any "lost" coins by basically accessing the same address on the opposing network.
All thats happened is we had one bitcoin with its blockchain (a record of transactions). Then someone decided they didn't like how bitcoin was going and decided to literally copy the same blockchain over to their new bitcoin cash, and from there on the transactions will be different.
Just make sure you know which version you want to be on (probably btc, not bch), and make sure you software you use for a wallet uses the same system, and you will never lose your money. Promise.

Thats up to the exchange. But in the case of coinbase, they do give you an equivalent amount of bitcoin cash.

The point is that you don't know what the app is doing behind the scenes. It might not have any malicious code in it today, but the app might update and then have code in it to send your keys along with the 12 word password to them, compromising everything. Or for all we know it does have malicious code in it now, we just don't know because they don't let us look into the source code.
Thats going to be a risk with any closed source wallet. If the code isn't available, you'll never have everyone onboard with it.

The end is only visible in hindsight.

RemindMe! 6 years "Am I rich or am I still poor?!"
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:16:25
I feel you. I'm poor enough that $16k would be life changing so it would be hard to return it. I still don't know if I would or wouldn't. I like to think I would return it but I know in the heat of the moment the thought of exchanging my money stresses for ethical/moral challenges is really tempting.
But I'm also poor enough that I wouldn't wish it on anyone and feel like putting someone else 16k in the hole could really fuck someone else up. Like I said I'm honestly not sure how I would react, I would probably debate it in my head and not tell anyone for at least a couple of days.
