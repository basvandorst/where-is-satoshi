People that support republicans that are not a) directly connected to the military industrial complex or b) in the richest 1% of the country are just dupes. This guy is NOT a Libertarian, at all, whatsoever. He's just another rat bastard republican suit ready to shred the constitution and put limits on personal freedom.
He's pro-life, anti-science, and honestly a little scary. I can't believe people in this sub are excited to support him... YES, I get it's a big deal he's accepting bitcoin, but dear god do not give him any!

No offense but you kind of sound like Josh Garza... the idea that comments on reddit drive the market is absurd.

This guy is a piece of shit. Just because he "likes BTC" doesn't excuse him for being a part of the same party that bankrupted the country and will continue to pump fed dollars into the military-industrial complex while giving tax breaks to the wealthiest in our society. Even with his "social policies" removed he is a piece of shit - and his stance on those issues *does* matter when it comes time for supreme court nominations.
I'm sorry but if you support this guy just because he accepts BTC and has a Libertarian dad, you're a dupe lapping up a brand.

These comments are beyond embarrassing...

Remind me how Paul is somehow not a "corrupt establishment candidate"?

No, I understand, but half-baked philosophy taught to most high school students doesn't work in the real world.  As much as you want to swallow the red pill and fly around like Neo it's not going to happen - because it's impossible to fly.  You think a law is unfair?  Ok, go ahead and break it.  Then be prepared to go to jail if you get caught.  If you want to change a law that's a whole other process - one that doesn't involve pounding cheesy nachos while browsing reddit.  Either way, the thing I find funny are not the laws themselves, just that people can't believe he's going to jail for providing an online marketplace for illegal drugs.  What's so hard to understand about crime and consequence?

God I'm tired of this circlejerk. Yeah no shit - drug laws should be different... but they're not. Why is everyone so appalled when someone is sent to jail for knowingly breaking the law, no matter how "unfair" it might be?

No, it wouldn't be bad.  Read what I wrote - it just wouldn't be surprising if that person faced consequences if he were caught.
