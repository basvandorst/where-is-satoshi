I just had Samurai create a wallet, I didn't specify segwit one way or the other. 
However when I try to import it into Electrum the derivation path defaults to 0. I have tried changing it to m/44'/60'/0'/0 but then the 'next' button was greyed out and I couldn't progress. 
What did you put in the derivation path?

I do actually get that, because it minimises the risk of your private key/seed combination becoming compromised. 
But, as this was a test wallet, it only had £1 worth of bitcoin because I wanted to play around with the recovery on different wallets. 
Unless each wallet has a different algorithm to calculate the private key from the seed, they should all validate to the same address right?

Yeah I'm ticking both 'BIP39 seed' and 'Extend this seed with custom words'. 
Even if I don't select 'Extend this seed with custom words' I get the account number screen and not the derivation path one.

Weird :-) I'm going to try it the other way round. Create on Electrum and import on Samurai. 
Thanks for the help though :)

In order.... I enter my seed &gt; enter my seed extension &gt; I am then taken to an Account Number page (which is defaulted to 0) &gt; Then if I click next it asks me for an encryption password &gt; Then it loads the wallet
I don't get asked for a derivation path specifically

If I add any of these into the 'Account Number' screen the 'Next' button greys out and I can't progress. 
How did you enter them in?

And you created the wallet on Samurai? Then used your 12 words and passphrase to open it on Electrum? 
Just tried adding the custom word after the seed, and had the same problem. How strange!

Where are you based? Are you looking for postage costs covered etc?

Have you settled on somewhere? I work in central London and may be able to help you out...
