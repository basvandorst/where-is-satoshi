Oh! You took a wrong turn. U-Turn back to commodities and take a left at ETFs. You're looking for the sign that says United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG). You can't miss it.

Where are the calculations?

And now I want a marshmallow.

Right? Thank God.

Can be bought in a ROTH IRA so gains are tax free. 
You can buy bitcoin in an IRA, but would have to be self directed which requires a bit more savvy and expense.

I have no need or reason to sell in the next 10 years or so. If something were to change with the fundamentals, I would reevaluate accordingly.

Because I suspect the price is going to move higher from here. Simple as that.

You're a smart man. Do what you gotta do.

I'm not a fan of a lot of the posts here either, my pet peeve is all the memes. That said, Bitcoin doesn't have to mean the same thing to everyone. I'll go so far as to say that for Bitcoin to succeed, it has to expand beyond those who hold it for ideological reasons.

You fell asleep didn't you you asshole?

I'll regret buying the dip later?

If you are intent on shorting Bitcoin, I would look at shorting gbtc. The reason is it's a Bitcoin trust that's trading at a super hefty premium.
That said, I wouldn't recommend shorting Bitcoin right now.

This guy gets it. Most people DCA for the wrong reasons, it actually has a lower expected return.

"The USA" doesn't hate bitcoin. It's barely on policy makers' radar. Banks only care so far as it's another asset class to offer and monetize (they'll find a way).
Everyone wants bitcoin to succeed? Most people don't give a shit.

I can speak to what generally happens in the US 
Coins get moved to an escrow wallet and then a service like bitpay is used to complete the transaction in dollars. 
The hardest part about an all coin transaction would be that there are parties at the table (title insurers mostly) who don't understand how to work in a non dollar transaction.

Putting an exclamation point at the end of your sentence doesn't make it true.

I've been on reddit for years.  I use an account for a month or two then move on.

Ya know, you being on the toilet has zero relevance to this story.
