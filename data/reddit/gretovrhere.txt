Agreed, the central message of the piece is that bitcoin should not be considered a sound investment and is only speculation at present.
As an investment it would be impossible to have bitcoin rated as anything other than junk due to there being no backing to the value.
This does not mean that people in the right financial positions cannot and should not speculate in bitcoin , or that a community that wants to see a decentralised banking system should not proceed in its efforts and the article should prompt no emotional response from those groups. The only people affected by the article are incompetent financial advisers who have been advising pensions to invest in bitcoin and they are probably few.

Not quite true, op has found an even more risky place to keep it, in some kind of online account with an exchange, most likely in a different jurisdiction and with very few obligations to him.
If it's in a bank the tax question can only be what should I have done? 
It's financial incompetence either way.
He'll probably invest it all in magic beans and then later ask if magic beans are a good investment.

Crypto won't help you here, you're spending money on that credit card that you don't own, bitcoin won't let you do this. Why do you think your bank should not charge you for providing you with credit?
If you don't need the credit, don't have the credit card.
If you do need the credit, have the card and pay the charge, it's not rocket science.

This is where the attitudes of many in this sub come into play.
There will never be anything like a mass adoption of Bitcoin whilst the prevailing mentality is to try to amass and hold as much Bitcoin as possible and never spend it.
Why would I accept Bitcoin as a payment method when noone is actually going to use it to buy something. If I can't sell for Bitcoin then I can't pay my staff in Bitcoin.
I would suggest the best indicator of approaching mass adoption will be the exchange of goods and services for Bitcoin, I don't mean how much Bitcoin is traded on exchanges or passed from one address to another, but how much Bitcoin did Walmart take in, or Microsoft or Steam and how did that compare to their visa income.

No it won't, it will be a hard fork.
If bitcoin cannot survive such a fork then it is destined to fail either now or at some point in the future.
I am sure bitcoin will be fine and I do not worry at all about 2x. If all hash power goes to 2x and we do a btc pow change I for one will be fine with that.

Unless you make multiple physical backups and store them in secure locations that you personally own on two different continents you can easily lose you private key and backup without being stupid.
Think fire, hurricane, earthquake, burglary, seizure by authorities or third parties just for starters.
I'm not saying it isn't possible to have a secure, resilient and redundant setup, but given the investment needed to do so you cannot say losing a private key is stupidity.

I appreciate what you're saying, but it just cannot be this way. 
Bitcoin can be easily forked by anyone, if the integrity of the network is reliant on forkees implementing replay protection then there must be something fundamentally wrong with the Bitcoin protocol.
For bitcoin to survive the network and wallet providers etc are going to have to learn to live with forks without replay protection, I dont see any viable alternative.

There are many online brokerages that function fine and will never need faxes or emails since it is all done online.
Any sensible broker should tell you that if you are likely to need to be liquid in a day then you shouldn't be investing in stocks in the flrst place.

Satoshi Nakamoto is the alias of the unknown creator of Bitcoin.

Just to be clear, you're saying that anything prior to central banks is not an acceptable example since before central banks world productivity was shocking?
Greece and Japan are good examples of countries with deflationary currencies in the last 30 years that greatly impacted  their productivity, there are many more. 
Poor financial decisions and investment instruments are not the result of fiat currency, it is just as easy to create financial instruments that abstract Bitcoin and grow to have more paper value than the Bitcoin backing them.

Your wallet should let you set a fee and tell you what the fee per byte is. I don't know many wallets, I use ledger wallet in chrome and mycelium on android and they both support this.
The size of the transaction I believe is mainly down to the number of input addresses, but again I am no expert.

Whilst what you say is correct, I think my problem with this sub is that this is very often not the attitude at all.
You see the silly "I've remortaged my house and invested my kid's college funds in Bitcoin" posts and the general comments are that this is an awesome idea, how could it not be, Bitcoin is guaranteed to be $10,000, $100,000 really soon!!!!!
This is obviously ridiculous, I'm a Bitcoin holder since $400 BTC and invest a little each month, and I'm up massively, others are up even more, but Bitcoin is way more precarious than some of the tech bubbles in the 2000s, there are no underlying assets, revenues or IP being owned, the only thing you own is abstract confidence. A loss of confidence could immediately drop Bitcoin prices to near zero in the space of one block. This could be too many forks, competition, mtgox esque problems, miner politics, technical exploitation(esp. disruption by state actors), there are many more ways this could all go wrong overnight.
Obviously in my interests I hope we see $100,000 BTC soon!

Life is just too short for this. Everyone is not trying to rip you off. Put the effort into increasing your income rather than putting it into an unnecesarrily overly defensive payment strategy.
You might find some errors, but ask yourself if the number of errors you find justifies how much of your life you wasted checking. If you are finding many errors you just need to change your suppliers.

"why not just add replay protection, letting us keep our shitcoin, and let the market decide?"
Just on this one comment, the Bitcoin protocol does not require any replay protection so why would you provide it?
Why do you think you need it? Surely you don't care if your btc transactions get replicated on the fork you don't care about? It should not affect you at all?

I quite like the idea of regular proof of work changes requiring software to do alot of the work, this should surely help promote decentralisation?

Hard forks would be inevitable, but hard forks are an opportunity for user decisions on how to proceed, hence the decentralisation. 
There should be options to lesson the impact of transitions (though I do not know their complexity)  eg by nodes accepting current pow and pow-1, as each pow is introduced the current becomes the legacy but still accepted pow, and the current legacy is dropped and no longer accepted.

ETH was priced at ~$350 in Jun 17 and then ~$150 in Jul 17. 
If you think your wealth is safe in crypto you are wrong. You are only gambling on crypto which everyone can sensibly do, but only with a percentage of their wealth.
It has come back up towards $350, but is still not there and you haves no guarantee that next time it will come back at all.

History has shown that deflation does lead to more prudent spending, which leads to a reduction in production, which leads to increasing unemployment, which leads to further reductions in spending, further reduction in production and more unemployment, effectively a deflationary spiral.

A shocking amount of paranoia here.
This is private individuals trading Bitcoin funds through JPMorgan as a broker.
When JPMorgan are buying Bitcoin it would not be this visible. They will definitely be buying bitcoin anyway since hedging is their business and they kind of have no choice, even if they think it will collapse they will allocate a calculated percentage to it based on their level of confidence it could be a success. They definitely will not hold zero Bitcoin or zero Bitcoin funds and I'm sure they have been holding for over 12 months.

Fiat money is money printed by a government with nothing of intrinsic value backing it, only the word of the government that the money is good. All the world's major currencies are fiat currencies.
Ln is the lightning network, it should provide faster payments with less load on the blockchain.

This is definitely an amazing idea, put all your wealth into a commodity that has recently demonstrated losing 25% of its value in a day. 
If you cannot keep your money in the bank then put all your wealth into gold, and maybe 10% in crypto if you're feeling adventurous.

I don't really care about the outcome but do want to play the game:
My last transaction was 7.9 sat per byte and took 20 mins
