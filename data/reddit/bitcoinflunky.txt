I can easily see that happening in developing countries, although at least in India I see it more of a Bitcoin Wallah situation.  Prepaid mobile phones are ubiquitous there so there's already a vendor network in place. You just need a service that allows one to credit stored value cards in Rupees.

I didn't bother to map the value of potential currency exchanges into the total 21 million bitcoins that can ever be issued.  It would be a strawman at best, and terrible hype at worst.  Will wider adoption up the value of BTC?  Presumably, but I don't anyone can really quantify how, yet.

Wow, thank you for all that data!  Why is Africa so expensive? Because of higher fraud incidence, smaller volume or tradition?  Any idea?
Sounds like the first place to set up a BTC ATM is there.

Nice. Step in the right direction, anyway.

Yeah, maybe.  The article states transaction fees "as low as" 3%. Which means a fixed cost + sliding scale fee, most likely.  Certainly an improvement, but a bitcoin ATM that spits out local currency with say no more than 1% conversion cost is what is required.  It's not like the ATM holder is taking any currency risk unless they also accept fiat and issue bitcoin. So there's no reason to build in a huge margin to hedge against big movements in the exchange rate.

No, I think he's actually right.  You can't have a new currency without a transition period, otherwise you run into the classic chicken/egg problem.  For bitcoin to succeed as an exchange currency, it must be readily portable into local fiat.  Eventually if bitcoin succeeds and we can all agree that's an unnecessary step, but until it's as widely accepted as the Euro exchange to spendable fiat must take place.  So a bitcoin ATM that doesn't impose a currency fee is indeed a good way to go.

That's the whole point - you really need a way to get back to local fiat without an onerous exchange fee until bitcoin sees wider adoption and becomes its own currency. At present bitcoin is just a *lingua franca* for state-issued fiat.
I like your suggestions about the P2P exchanges, that's a step in the right direction.  If the farmer selling vegetables in Mexico can pay his suppliers in bitcoin the whole thing becomes moot. Until then, we need something less dear than the 5% transaction fee to help accelerate BTC adoption.
