If you have bitcoins on sites like Coinbase or exchanges, your trusting them that their security measures will keep your BTC safe. However things do tend to fail and the possibility of getting your BTC stolen in those sites are real. You might want to look into cold storage and limit the amount of online sites that have your coins. There are offline software cold wallets like Armory and Electrum and there are physical wallets like paper or hardware wallets (Trezor, Keepkey, or Ledger Nano). 
The Ledger Nano and Nano S is cheaper than Trezor and Keepkey, if you are stretched on money. Paper wallets are free but you need to follow specific steps to make sure your private key doesn't get compromised

Paper or hardware wallet.
Paper wallets are free if you have a printer, but you have to do specific steps so that your private keys doesn't get compromised. It's good for long time storage if you keep it in safe (away from water, fire, etc)
Hardware wallets like Trezor, Ledger wallets, and Keepkey. If you want a cheap hardware wallet Ledger wallets are cheaper than Trezor or Keepkey. But a lot of good reviews are pointed towards trezor. Good for long term storage and even if you forgot your PIN/Password you can recover them with a recovery seed.
I don't think offline software wallets are good for long term storage because you might accidentally throw away your computer/laptop
