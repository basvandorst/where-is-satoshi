I just tried it out. I don't know about the POS, but for the regular QuickBooks Online e-invoice it shows a QR code.
The setup was very easy to do. I like this integration a lot better than the Coinbase integration, since the Coinbase integration requires that the customer also have a Coinbase account.

I guess it depends on how much you buy. I don't know what the currency exchange rate is with CIBC, but with RBC they charge 2.5% for the currency conversion [
If you use CAVIRTEX, you pay $1.50 for the interac online option [ and then 0.75% to purchase [ 
So, assuming $500 (which is the max you can do with CAVIRTEX), this is the breakdown for both.
Debit Visa or Mastercard $500 x 2.5% currency exchange rate = $12.50
CAVIRTEX Interac Online $1.50 + ($500 x 0.75%) = $1.50 + $3.75 = $5.25
But what about $100?
Debit Visa or Mastercard $100 x 2.5% currency exchange rate = $2.50
CAVIRTEX Interac Online $1.50 + ($100 x 0.75%) = $1.50 + $0.75 = $2.25
Note that both methods are virtually instant. So, provided the prices for Bitcoin on both Circle and CAVIRTEX are the same, CAVIRTEX is the cheaper option for anything above $100. I should also mention that CAVIRTEX does charge 0.0005 bitcoin to transfer bitcoin out, so at $400 USD for 1 bitcoin is $0.20. The fee with Circle was 0.0001 bitcoin, which at $400 USD for 1 bitcoin is $0.04.

I just tried it, it works! Although, to be clear, the iTunes gift card is only valid in for accounts where the store is set to the United States (which means you must have a United States address and credit card).

Anyone know if there are fees associated with accepting Bitcoin via Stripe? I ran a couple quick tests and quickly looked through the docs but don't see any indication of fees anywhere.

They are [officially]( accepting Bitcoin through an integration with Coinbase now. More info [here]( as well.

I've used them to purchase bitcoins and it was a fairly smooth process. I mainly speak English as well.

Just tried and it worked like a charm! Cool stuff and so easy. No usernames, passwords, etc... only instant gratification.

What do people think of the best way to handle hot wallets (or spending money) for the average Joe?
I would guess (but I could be completely wrong), that using a desktop app, the biggest risk is losing the private keys rather than having them stolen. The loss may be due to hard drive failure or accidental deletion by accident.
Would using a service like blockchain.info with 2 factor authentication (2fa) be safer for the average person than a desktop app (assuming it's connected to the Internet)? I know that blockchain.info also have a chrome app and mobile app. How does the safety of those two apps compare to using the regular web app?

I really hope that the Canadian Senate takes Andreas' talk to heart in their report. I also can't believe that I watched the entire 2 hours. It was quite interesting to listen to, as the senators raised a lot of common objections and concerns around security, identity, control, valuation, and regulation.
At the start I found that it the discussion was more high level and theoretical, but as the talk progressed, I enjoyed hearing some more practical examples. 
A few takeaways:
* There's a big opportunity right now in international remittances
* There's a also lots of potential in the unbanked and underbanked in non G7 countries (even more so than in G7 countries)
* Bitcoin is like the Internet, in that you can regulate it in one country, but you can't stop it anywhere. So, stifling innovation early on has a great potential to set Canada behind on being a player in Bitcoin
* That currency is an app running on the blockchain, but it's not the only app. Just like how email is an app running on the Internet, but it's not the only one.
