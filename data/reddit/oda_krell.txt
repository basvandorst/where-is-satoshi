Did you ever consider or discuss with the team making the currently *optional* wallet passphrase *mandatory*? 
It has bothered me for a while that there's presumably a large share of Electrum users who skip setting a passphrase, thereby opening themselves up for additional attack vectors. And, apparently, today's vulnerability does in fact rely crucially on the lack of a wallet passphrase to steal user funds.

Wow. That's some grade A cognitive dissonance going on there in the OP. Here's my take on it:
**Coinbase (some time ago):** Let's properly scale this motherf*cker! SegWit combined with a moderate blocksize increase should be a fair compromise, right?
**Core:** You wish. We don't negotiate with terrorists!
**Coinbase:** Okay, suit yourself. But don't come crying if this blows up and the network comes to a grinding halt.
**Core:** (comes crying when this thing blows up)

Agreed. I should have written above "an archaic misunderstanding of what made gold interesting throughout history", not just "gold".
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:11:54
I like the style of your argument.
First, I should say, there *are* in fact valid arguments against raising max blocksize, or raising it too much (the often cited centralization concerns). However, most network participants (miners, merchants, regular users) seem to agree there are even *stronger* arguments in favor of raising it (namely: to avoid artificially "capped" adoption), and that raising it to 20MB now is far from exceptional.
And I believe your argument, or thought experiment, is spot on: by the logic of those who put the centralization concerns above everything else, why not *lower* max block size? 
One thing should be undisputed - as you pointed out yourself: the current value of 1MB is entirely arbitrary, entered as an hoc fix of a technical problem, not as a permanent and motivated solution\*, or because of strong economical convictions that *Bitcoin must be like gold as much as possible* ... Because that's, I suspect, the real economical reason behind most of the noise about max blocksize.

Great job, OP.
If the average new Bitcoin user would just get Electrum, instead of setting up some online wallet with a less-than-optimal implementation, or worse even, use a service that doesn't make him or her the sole keeper of the private keys, the crypto world would be a safer space, imo.

No, your question is entirely justifiable.
I can think of two scenarios, assuming the order actually went through as shown, and it's not an API glitch:
- the order was placed as 'market order', but momentarily the trade engine matched it with an offer that was deep into the order book, as opposed to the nearest order
- the order was placed as a (rather low) limit order, in which case Bitstamp's engine still should have matched it with the highest existing orders first, i.e. well above 633.
In either case, the engine must have ignored order much, much higher.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:27:23
That's a bit of a simplification though. That belief of "smart money" could well exist, but in combination with the belief that they can suppress the market rather effectively and maximize their long term profits by first bringing price down, or at least "stabilizing" it during their buy-in period.
Please note, I'm neither calling this "manipulation" (because it doesn't require privileged information or exclusive tools to influence the market, other than more capital than the average participant has), nor do I necessarily say that's the case right now ... I'm just pointing out that the syllogism "price stays below 700, therefore big money doesn't believe in above 700" is a bit too simplistic.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:15:44
You're kidding, right? Did you read my first comment?
The order executed at 633, **3000 BTC below what was actually on the order book**.

@_date: 2014-11-05 12:52:53
Complete agreement!
Electrum is, in my opinion, the currently best balance between *security* (you are in control of your own private keys, and the Electrum software itself is extremely well maintained), and *usability* (it's a 'lightweight' client, so it's not a full node in the Bitcoin network but relies on servers to broadcast transactions).
On the one end of the range, running a full node will always be the right thing to do if you're on a big enough machine and have a fast enough connection. On the other end, online wallets can have their place as well, for small amounts of coins being stored, or to get someone introduced to Bitcoins. But in the middle (actually, leaning more towards "full node" in terms of security) sit the lightweight clients, and in my experience, Electrum is the best of the bunch currently available.
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:27:52
To store/transfer coins, best to get [Electrum]( a so called *lightweight* client. Faster and easier to use than the reference (core) client because it doesn't download the entire blockchain, and **a lot** safer than online wallets.

Bitstamp did a good job containing it.

I know, a news format on TV (or print, for that matter) prefers news items as 'the reason' for a rise, but I'm going to suggest that the largest influence on the recent breakout are technicals.
In a nutshell: ever since January 2014, until mid-May, both extremely good news were received ($30M for Bitpay, first significant retailer, Overstock, accepts Bitcoin as payment method), as well as extremely bad news (Mtgox implodes, China putting pressure on exchanges, transaction malleability scare).
Probably for no bigger reason than that we were in a correction anyway (double top November/December 2013, then failure to break $1000 early January), by and large, only the *bad* news took hold, while the good news kind of slid right off.
Which can only go on for some time. The biggest change in April/May was that selling pressure had decreased to the point where no more sudden crashes seemed likely. Which led to a brief period of sideways trading through mid May. Which in turn gave the market the chance to price in the, so far ignored, good news mentioned earlier. The rest of the rise is just momentum creating more momentum.
Someone, I forgot who, suggested the image of a "coiled spring" that had been compressed quite hard for the past 5 to 6 months - which is an eternity in Bitcoin terms. At some point, that pressure had to be released, and that release was predictably violent.

@_date: 2014-09-27 10:10:30
First: The level of security that would allow you to "relax" depends on your usage case, and the value of your (hypothetical) Bitcoin holdings:
You plan to get $10, maybe $50 worth of Bitcoin? By all means, go the easy route and use an **online wallet** service, like [Coinbase]( for example. It's not extremely safe, but then again, it's not a lot of money at stake either.
You plan to put more money into Bitcoin? $1000, or more? Then your security needs obviously are much higher before you can relax. 
Ideally, you should follow the recommended route: **cold storage through paper wallets created on a computer without Internet access**. 
That would be optimal... but is also rather unrealistic, in my opinion. A lot of effort, and you can't actually *use* your bitcoins without compromising the paper wallets.
So here's my suggestion... Please understand that this is not accepted by everybody in the Bitcoin community as "safe enough", but I'd argue for most users, it actually is:
**Step 1:** Get and run a computer with a sufficiently safe operating system. Which means: Unix based or Unix like. Which means: Linux or Mac OS. Note that this will also allow you to use online banking in a much more secure manner from now on.
(Note: It is in principle possible to get your Windows computer to the state of "safe enough", but for the average user, it's a lot more difficult.)
If a Mac is too pricey (I think they are), consider buying an ultra cheap netbook. Lenovo or Asus offers netbooks for around $200. If you accept them used, closer to $100.
Then get and install [Ubuntu]( or, if the computer is comparably underpowered, [Xubuntu]( The OS is for free. If you need help installing the OS, ask the resident nerd around :D Keep the OS up-to-date, and you now have a "safe enough" computer.
**Step 2:** Get [Electrum]( That's a so called 'lightweight Bitcoin client', which means two important things:
a) it is not as "trustless" a full Bitcoin client (you rely on others to relay your transaction to the network)
b) it *is* trustless in the most important way there is: **you, and only you, store and manage your private keys.**
Point b) is the single biggest problem for those who  use Bitcoin exchanges, or online wallets, etc. You are not really in possession of your owned bitcoins because you don't hold their private keys. With Electrum (or Armory, an alternative client to Electrum), you have a lightweight, easy to use, way to make sure the private keys are in your own hands.
And that's it. You're done.
Final remark: generally, employ good security practices... 
1) Keep your operating system (like Ubuntu) updated. 
2) **Use strong passwords**, both for the OS's user account, and for Electrum. Here's a nice illlustration of how to come up with a very secure **and** rather easy to remember password: [XKCD 'Password Strength'](
(don't use that exact example though :D)

@_date: 2014-03-04 20:40:13
For context: the order book was entirely filled around market price. No way this trade would have gone through, unless their engine glitched.
Also, it's not just a matter of btcwisdom displaying wrong data: Bitstamp's API confirms it was executed at that price:
{"date": "1393957577", "tid": 3913507, "price": "633.64", "amount": "12.23303074"}, {"date": "1393957576", "tid": 3913506, "price": "633.64", "amount": "0.14733528"}
I'm not trying to be an alarmist, but if Bitstamp doesn't answer what happened today, I will remove my business from them. That's what I always told the people that kept trading on mtgox, to leave after getting the first warning signs, and a buggy trade engine is *exactly* such a warning sign that things are going wrong on an exchange.
**EDIT**: To be absolutely clear: this was not a trade that should have gone through. It executed at a price that was **3000 BTC into the order book**, in other words, a glitch. Possibly the trade never actually happened, and their API glitched instead, but Bitstamp *really* should explain what happened there.
**EDIT 2, UPDATE:** user/hazek from Bitstamp answered on btctalk: they say it was an isolated glitch while updating their engine, and they're reimbursing the trader who sold below market. Thanks for the response, Bitstamp. Confidence restored, I'd say (but I hope it was really an isolated case)
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:03:56
You make it sound like we know for sure that those two groups aren't, more or less, the same. We never had to really put that to a test until now.
But even if they're not identical, what's the point of pissing off those who invested heavily to secure the network (and make a profit, of course)?  *Especially* when the concern is a valid one: if you are not a huge mining operation, without pooling, any investment in mining equipment is just a lottery ticket: spend $2000 on a rig, hope that in about a year's time you get a shot at making $10,000 by soloing a block. And most won't make their investment back.
Miners being economic actors, this will most likely lead to: more centralization. 
Small miners won't even bother upgrading their hardware, big ones however will, because they are essentially their own pool which mitigates the high variance of rewards.
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:12:19

I heard the "full node" argument before, but I never quite understood how that could be relevant... if you spend a substantial amount on ASICs, isn't it comparably trivial economically to host a full node as well?

Not a bad article, and I'm glad to see a (more or less) mainstream article shine a light on the unique position of Gavin, but there are still some misconceptions.


Even this article operates under the incorrect impression that there is **the** Bitcoin code, and that only the core devs have "the power to change [that] code." 
Bitcoin has to be equated with the Bitcoin network in the context of this article. The network is defined by its nodes. In principle, you don't have to run the original client to become a node, just one that is compatible initially. Hypothetically, over time, that could even lead to a network comprised *mostly* of non-original clients.
Sounds like nitpicking perhaps, but it's an important distinction in my opinion: the Bitcoin network can, in principle, steer away from the current dev team. Not saying it should, but it's important to understand that there's no "special power" (beyond a lot of well-deserved trust) that anyone, including Gavin, holds over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:31:40
I still don't get why there isn't a *market driven* mechanism that sets the fee value? 
By the way, it's quite possible I'm too naive about this, but maybe someone can explain it to me why the following doesn't work:
I understand some form of minimum tx fee is necessary to avoid tx spam. But why can't it be based dynamically on what turns out to be the lowest fee that miners currently accept?
Some form of bootstrapping issue is there of course, but that could be solved (say: min_fee = 1/2 current average or maybe median fee). It seems that, in principle, it should work, and it would mean the minimum fee would be readjusted to whatever is the minimum miners are willing to accept.
Like I said, maybe I'm missing something obvious, so I can be corrected easily by someone with a better understanding of the protocol.

The project sounds great, but am I the only one wondering if there was a subtle shift in the overall goal of the contest?
Mike Hearn is very active as a BCF member and head of the (law &amp; policy, iirc) committee. I find it hard to be believe he is really interested in *replacing* the Foundation, or more accurately perhaps: in my own discussions with him earlier this year, I didn't get the impression that he considers it necessary to replace the Foundation. The bounty provider Olivier Janssens seems to believe that however, or at least his originally call for the contest sounded like it.
Anyone care to speculate who switched sides since then, or am I just misinterpreting the situation?
@_date: 2014-11-08 17:03:11


That's exactly what it would be. My point was, it would be great to have a really *fun* interactive faucet so people from outside the crypto community want to play it, and then hopefully become interested in the topic.
That game I linked to is fundamentally a way to *make* money for the developers. You can earn in-game currency by performing some actions, or you can speed up the process by buying (the 2nd tier) in-game currency with real world money. 
I guess the big difference is that the faucet version of this game would *cost* money to maintain (and/or be ad financed, as you point out). The greater goal here being a marketing tool, if you want, for Bitcoin.

Dogecoin is a joke. A mildly funny one, and one that is traded enough to lead to a market cap of a few million USD, but make no mistake: it's most likely a passing fad, and at best will be a (humorous) niche usage crypto. 
The above isn't changed by the astroturfing attempts by the dogecoin community, quite a few of which are probably trying a bit of a pump&amp;dump by posting in r/bitcoin,
Two less polemic, more analytical remarks:
* I will take dogecoin more serious if and only if I hear about the first dogecoin related investments (a well funded start up related to it). Didn't see anything like that yet, and don't expect it.
* USD/BTC is relatively stable for the time being (well, for the last few weeks). That's good for BTC adoption, but less interesting for those of us who like to actively trade (I know it, I am one of those). So smaller cryptos are a profitable diversion, to trade larger swings, and see more price action. Once BTC leaves the consolidation period (probably not before early/mid February, and possible as late as mid 2014), I expect the doge fad to largely be over, as traders will be more interested in the more liquid BTC market again.

Excellent PSA.
Forget about the bear market for a second, and let's realize what's really relevant: a strong network.
Everyone keeps talking about the hash rate of the network, and how relevant it is to keep the network secure, but it is often omitted that the total number of full nodes is just as important to keep it safe.
So, please run a full node, even if you use lightweight wallets like Electrum for your everyday transactions. Think of it as your "civic duty", like going to vote in the elections.
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:38:00
While the idea behind what you write is fine, you're also oversimplifying: *Investing* more than, say 10% in an extremely risky asset like BTC is not a good idea (although I do also cast doubt on the exact number 10% -- the Kelly criterion might help here to get a value), however, if you are willing actively *trade* (not necessarily day trade, but trade the larger swings), then I claim a much higher value is perfectly fine.
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:40:09

In my opinion, OP's satirical message is based on a misconception.
OP thinks of it from the *moral* perspective: shoes are just as responsible for criminal activity as the currency used for it (i.e. not at all), so there's no moral justification to restrict either.
Government action is however not based on moral reasoning (mostly), but on *practical* considerations. Restricting on which shoes you wear wouldn't change one bit the amount of criminal activities. Placing strict rules on use of currency however *does* have an effect.
It's up for discussion whether it's really effective (for every money laundering case that's revealed there's probably several that go undetected), and you can also (justifiably) point out that a lot of the crimes that are prevented by placing restrictions on transfer of private wealth are monstrous creations by the state itself (e.g. "the war on drugs"), but you can't seriously argue that capital control is *completely* ineffective. Just try to transfer a large sum of money to a foreign drug cartel and see whether the authorities will come knocking at your door :D
tl;dr OP argues from a *moral* perspective, however the government desire to restrict Bitcoin is based on *practical* consideration.s

Not criticizing the methodology per se (much better than what you can usually read in the popular media), but there's one blatant omission: deriving the number of Bitcoin owners from blockchain addresses alone ignores the (sad, maybe, from a security point of view) truth that a lot of people probably "own" bitcoins only on an exchange. 
Their coins will be gathered inside a few huge exchange addresses, which doesn't allow drawing conclusions about the total numbers of owners. In other words, there's quite some room towards the upper side with that number range "between 1/2 and 3/4 million". I could easily imagine it being twice as many as that, considering what we know about account registration numbers on the major exchanges.

No downvote from me, but:
You're an example of a "dumb miner" (assuming that you mine, and not implying that all miners are dumb).
Whether you sell immediately or hoard your mined coins for  the long term, you are a effectively a stakeholder in BTC and should have an interest in seeing maximal valuation of it. 
Participating in the mining centralization process is a bad choice. Economically irrational. Detrimental to your own interests.
Don't believe me? How about the Bitcoin Foundation's risk management study, identifying centralization aspects as the greatest current risk factor for Bitcoin? ([link](

It seems so obvious, don't know why we don't have this already?
I like the reddit tipping we're doing now, and I also know there are already bitcoin faucets, but what is missing, imo, is a really *slick* looking, fun, addictive little game like this one, *Bitcoin Billionaire*, but instead of earning some in-game currency, you gather bitcoins (bits, whatever).
At the end of a session, the game suggest that you can withdraw your earnings, and helps you set up a (real) Bitcoin address, guiding you to blockchain.info or Electrum.
Anyone else thinks this would be a great (and playful) way to get people involved? How much does a mobile game that looks as good and is as well designed as Bitcoin Billionaire cost to develop, anyone can comment on this?

True, they probably exist, but - especially the Bitcoin "bulls" - greatly overestimate their importance.

Good answer. I'm pretty sure we'll see some legal action down the road about what exactly "investing their profits" means in this context. The solution could turn out to be as simple as BTC companies keeping a substantial active reserve of bitcoins for liquidity, as a de facto "investment", even though it will not be one by name.

@_date: 2014-03-04 22:57:07
Yeah, I agree. I'm just a bit angry to be honest, because I've it just happens so regularly that I contact Bitstamp and ask them for some reply, and they never answer (like when they disabled some accounts BTC withdrawal as a security precaution). Their PR can be really quite annoying at times.
In principle, I agree though: it's too early to declare them as bad as gox. I just *really* hope they answer this question, and don't just ignore it, hoping we will forget about it tomorrow.

Thanks for the link, interesting read. I didn't have in mind though what they are talking about (which seems to be: efficiency considerations).
I can be corrected on this, but the way I understood it there are plausible (though not necessarily likely) attack vectors on the integrity of the network that don't rely on a majority of computing power, but establishing a majority of dishonest nodes, or perhaps more accurately: certain attacks on the network become more difficult assuming a larger number of honest full nodes are employed (e.g. sybil type attacks)
But I mean it when I say: this is based on my, possibly incomplete, understanding, so I can be corrected by someone with a deeper understanding of the network.

Latching onto your comment, if you allow...
Complete agreement. 
contribution is much appreciated, but imo the biggest remaining problem is the high reward variance and the disincentive to (average, non farm sized) solo mining this causes.
I admit, I'm not well informed enough about the current state of affairs, so I'll have to ask:
Are there any (serious) proposals so far, to make "small" solo mining viable? Some way to simulate the reward scheme of a pool, but without miners having to actually be part of a pool?

Pretty disingenuous presentation, OP:
You throw together, under "sceptics", people that start their quote on the topic with:


However, both the title and tone of your post insinuate the disagreement is much broader than the question exactly *how* the max blocksize change should be handled...
Bad post, and you should feel bad about it. Re-open it, with the same content, and the title "Is there consensus that we need  a 20 MB max blocksize?". 
That'd be the correct title, but immediately sounds less sensational than the insinuation that there's widespread disagreement about needing a change of max blocksize *at all*.

Well, anonymity is *not* the problem here: you can ask for a Bitpay payment link without providing any additional information. I just did so, in fact.
But it's true, accepting Bitcoin through a payment provider like Bitpay possibly means they convert to USD immediately. Which is something we have to deal with for the time being, I believe: Bitcoin is a brilliant Internet payment system already, but as a unit of account, I can see why companies (or non-profits) prefer USD for now. 
When Bitcoin per unit market value stabilizes in the future (and eventually, it most likely will), I expect more companies / organizations to accept it without immediate USD conversion.

re: "permanent" damage
In principle, that's my understanding as well, although I think it *does* include the possibility that an attacker could isolate individual nodes (with some likelihood) into a separate network in which double spending attacks are easier to execute for him.
Plus, even if the attack doesn't necessarily mean the integrity of the blockchain is threatened, it does definitely entail a serious disruption of how the network is intended to work, i.e. an individual node could no longer trust to be on the "right" network. 
This could mean serious *reputational* damage to the network, which is not inconsequential at all, considering that Bitcoin's functionality does depend on the trust the participants have in it.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:01:16
Maybe somone with a better technical understanding of the protocol can help me out there: everyone worries about the "51% attack" of hashing power, but isn't there the (maybe more practically relevant) risk of a "node majority" attack?
Say a majority of hashing power is honest, but a majority of full nodes is *not*. Am I guaranteed to be relayed to the truly longest version of the blockchain, or can the majority of dishonest nodes prevent me from seeing it (with some probability)? 
Like I said, I don't have a solid grasp of the protocol, so I need to ask for confirmation for the above. But if I do get it right, isn't &lt;10k full nodes a pretty low number considering the value at stake, and constitutes a rather worrying possibility for an attack vector on the network?

Awesome news. First the PETA announcement, now this...
Time for a quick plug/crosspost to my bitcointalk thread, where I invite Bitcoin investors/stakeholders to make donations to p2pool miners, to give them additional incentives to join the pool. 
My argument, in a nutshell: it is **in every investor's own self interest** to support decentralized mining like p2pool.
[\(bitcointalk.org/speculation\) Should we (the investors, I mean) help incentivize p2pool?](
Note: I get that p2pool scalability is still an issue perhaps, but wouldn't it be awesome if, in 2015, p2pool would the single biggest pool?

Right. Not saying it's impossible there was such a 'directive', just that I also know that the individual Sparkassen are usually fiercely independent. 
There is such a thing as a "Sparkassenverband" which works as a regional body collecting all Sparkassen of one of the German states (Bundesland), so the first question would be: are the "no transfer" results all from within the same state?
If not, there is the "Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband", a national organisation collecting all local Sparkassen, but to my knowledge, they (usually?) don't influence the daily business of the local affiliates.
I still consider it more likely that individual Sparkasse branches (which, as a bank, is relatively "conservative") decided to block Bitcoin related transfers, rather than some centralized decision being the cause. Bitcoin isn't the only decentralized entity :D
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:25:05


Or, go about it exactly the other way around and *do* use dictionary words for your passphrase, just enough of them, in what I colloquially refer to as the 'xkcd password method'.
First, absolute password/phrase strength seems less of an issue for BIP38 from what I gather, because pre-computed table based cracking approaches are ruled out. Note that I'm following [the argument presented here]( which makes sense to me, together with reading the [BIP38 specification]( If I repeat wrong information though, please correct me.
Second, even if you are aiming for a 'maximally safe' password, the desired entropy bits can just as well be generated by using a sufficient number of dictionary words. The two main points to keep in mind though: (a) use a sufficiently large dictionary (ideally, if you're bilingual, consider combining more than one language), and (b) make sure that the choice of words from the dictionary is purely random and not subject to your brain's bias to "pick the first word that comes to your mind" or "to pick the page of the dictionary that opened the easiest". Use an algorithmic method instead to be sure.
The huge advantage of (natural language) word based passphrases is the relative ease with which even high entropy passphrases can be remembered by the human mind, and the very high error tolerance with which they are recorded - ever wondered if that password you wrote down years ago had a capital 'i' at position 3 or a lower case 'L'? Then you know what I mean :D

To recap: 1) Andreas made a mistake, agreed. 2) banning him for this one remark is a pretty heavy handed reaction.
From what I gather, he didn't organize any serious vote brigading off-site, but he was making the rather flippant remark to "downvote trolls". That remark on its own is probably still below a bannable offense, especially as a first offense. 
Delete the offending post if on reddit itself, and write a warning to him before banning - that would seem to be the reasonable approach in cases like this. Immediate ban for a grey area case like this is bad style, unrelated to whether the topic is Bitcoin or not.

Like the article a lot. Critical, to the point where I'm sure it'll piss off many of the more 'hardline' crypto enthusiasts, but it's remarkably accurate and fair, in my opinion.
Example: *So* many mainstream articles get the "Bitcoin based service X has been hacked" news items wrong, instead more or less implying *Bitcoin* itself has been hacked. Bullshit of course.
Then there's the countering view of the enthusiasts, us, that I've read so often: Bitcoin itself has never been hacked, it is abundantly safe. Ergo, nothing to worry about. True of course, but also missing the point the WSJ article makes:
As long as Bitcoin based services are hacked left and right, it doesn't matter if the network is "secured by the laws of the universe". In the public eye, security in Bitcoin is an issue.
Nuanced point, and I appreciate it a lot. WSJ is writing some excellent articles lately on crypto in my opinion. *A lot* better than much of the trash coming from Wired or the NYT, to name just two papers that seem to take great pride in misrepresenting crypto whenever they get a chance.

Not going to diss Coinbase, they're solid as far as I can tell, but it's really a lot better not to think of a company holding your funds for you as a 'wallet' in the strict sense, no matter how reliable they've been in the past. 
That's kind of the magic of btc (or most cryptos, in general), that you can be solely in charge of your funds without resorting to archaic methods like storing wads of cash under your mattress :D
I've recommended [Electrum]( as the best wallet for most users for a long time now. It's a 'simplified' type of wallet, compared to Bitcoin Core, in the sense that you don't download the Blockchain yourself to run it, but rely on servers run by others to provide that information for you.
The risk for your *funds* by doing so is zero, since you're signing transactions (and store private keys) locally, the only 'risk' is that, if these servers were compromised, your transaction might be delayed or never broadcast. 
The huge *advantage* is, setting up a wallet with Electrum is trivially easy, you can immediately start using it, and on top of it, it has a neat deterministic wallet creation/reconstruction feature, i.e. you get a very long 'passphase'\* that allows you to recover funds from your addresses if you should ever lose access to your wallet/its password/your hardware/etc.

Valid point. Sounds a bit like damage control / spin mode. That said...
How about acknowledging the uncomfortable truth *why* any of this had to happen: falling bitcoin market value.
The foundations (afaik) keeps a substantial part of their assets in bitcoin, so their funds (as measured in USD) went down as well over the last year. And I'm pretty sure, if they would have diversified more, the community would have complained even more ("How dare they not using BTC as a store of value, as intended!").
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:42:46
Problematic as well - given that there's no guarantee of being paid any substantial (USD) amount in case of a long bear market, it would only attract the "true believers", which I personally don't think is such a great idea. I simply think BTC just isn't very useful yet as a *unit of account* (but it's a pretty great value transfer &amp; ownership registration mechanism already), so 'raw' salaries in BTC is perhaps a bit too idealistic.
Maybe something like 'hedged' salary would have been a good way to go: salary denominated in bitcoin, like your suggest, but capped to a max USD value (bull markets are nice, but they don't last forever, and your salary shouldn't go through the roof just because of them), and on the other end, defining a guaranteed USD floor as well (foundation members have to pay rent as well, after all :D)

I agree in principle with what you say (about the hard to define "retro vibe" coming from the project), but let's also be clear about something else: It is currently maybe the best lightweight client out there (beating MultiBit because of the deterministic wallet function).
Electrum is a project by people knowing *exactly* what they are doing on the back end side of the software, who maybe know a bit less about it from the front end side (the UI looks a bit dated), and know comparably little in my opinion (unfortunately) about marketing.
Hardly their fault though, it's mainly a budget constraint I'd say. I would love to see some venture capital going their way, so they can hire some interface designer (a guy wearing big horn-rimmed glasses :D). The only problem is, how do you monetize an open source client like Electrum, in order to attract that capital... no idea, I admit.

Current value of the limit is arbitrary, that's not even a question. There being some limit makes sense (to prevent flooding), but demanding to treat the current value as immutable is an insult to your own intelligence.

Makes sense, unless of course you have a very different plan for the network in mind...
The only ~~good~~ (EDIT) logically valid, but still pretty bad reason I can see to be categorically against adjusting max block size as the network grows (*adjust* the limit,  not *remove* it entirely) is if you would like Bitcoin to turn into "semi fungible high limit poker chips for the elite" in the long run.

I personally suspect there's a second reason they have in the back of their mind, but that they're not openly admitting:
By treating arbitrary value  as "holy" (max block size), they hope to prevent discussions in the far future about the *other* arbitrary value, the big one.
Now, to be clear: I am *for* raising max block size, and *against* changing the total no. of coins mined. Still, "21 million" as a particular number is arbitrary as well. 
It's just that there are good reason to cap the total no of coins/units **and never change that limit**, because otherwise the perception of a 'finite supply currency' would be damaged.
On the other hand, Bitcoin was never intended (or widely understood) as a 'limited no. of tx per day currency', so gradually raising max block size as the network grows isn't a big deal.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:08:50
I'm not sure what exactly you're arguing against...


Never said anything else. I was talking about the reverence one feels for the original protocol, and which parts of it one considers 'immutable' (not technically immutable, but as an imperative.)
For example, I guess you consider 21M to be one of the immutable parts of the protocol, but not 1MB, right? So do I. 
Not everyone does though: some people think the 1MB limit is a strong (economic) factor as well, just like the cumulative reward limit, and neither should be touched. 
I'm not saying I agree with them, I'm just trying to determine the reasons why some people feel so strongly about adjusting max block size value as the network grows.

Meh, the old "TA is just a self fulfilling prophecy at best, and cargo cult at worst" sentiment. Mostly borne out of ignorance, and a very superficial understanding of what TA actually can be, when properly employed.
I've written so often about this, I became very selective in my responses... it almost entirely seems to depend on the forum/audience whether they actually bother to read the arguments in favor of technical analysis (in the widest sense, which includes algorithmic methods based on factors that discretionary TA users also employ)... if they're semi interested in TA, it's can be an interesting argument which parts of TA work, and which ones are just BS. But if the target group is completely convinced it doesn't work **and** they don't even bother taking some look at the literature, then it's hopeless.
So, I'll just drop those three (mostly unrelated) bread crumbs. Read it if you're interested, or don't. Doesn't really matter either way :)

I see, I just noticed the word Stammtisch at the beginning of a page, but I guess I failed to see that the page is at the end. Anyway, it was just a minor observation, I think it's a good idea to make bitcoin sound less like "technology" and more like something approachable.
I'm German, but I live in Amsterdam at the moment. Don't know enough about the Dutch mindset to say if they care about inflation as much as many Germans, but judging by the big similarities otherwise, I'd say probably yes.

No, not really. No major language is "managed" in the way you seem to think it is. Even French, with its Academie Francaise, isn't a controlled language in any meaningful sense, and certainly not controlling the grammar (language is a complex construct, partially natural, partially social, but almost certainly impossible to control completely in a top-down manner)

Thanks for the link. That's the answer I was hoping for.
EDIT: did a quick etimation of the hashrate based on the Titan specs and the mining hardware comparison, and while the gap is still substantially higher, it seems to close a bit when comparing hashrates:
Titan: (estimate) (16-core opteron x 18,688 + Nvidia Tesla K20X x 18,688)  ~= 16,408,064 Mhash/s [1]
Network Hashrate: 61 Terahashs/s = 61,000,000 Mhash/s (correct me if I'm wrong)
[1] Note: I have no idea if it is actually true that the hashrate simply scales with the number of processors.

Really? The only site so far I've seen saying it's a "DDoS attack" is mtgox. And I don't trust the bullshit that comes out of that site's news section any more than I trust them to run their site properly.
But by all means, correct me if I'm wrong, and if you've found statements by, say  bitstamp or bitcoin-24 saying something similar.

~~Complete bullshit. Your experience as a "professional equities trader for 3 years" seems to have clouded your reading comprehension skills.~~
Go back to the article, and read it again. The part that you dismiss in one, completely uninformative sentence:


is actually the core of the argument that prices were (and will be again) manipulated in a relatively simple way, analogous to a DDoS attack, only that instead of hammering the web server indiscriminately, the attack constists of micro-transaction spam. The fact that this method doesn't work the same in your line of work has nothing to do with what can happen at a bitcoin exchange.
Is it "proof" of price manipulation? No, that claim is too strong. But a lot of people came to similar conclusions upon noticing the micro transaction spam, and the fact that it drove down the (perceived) price, while also causing a lag. 
At the very least, the big exchanges need to introduce measures against this kind of spam, since it serves absolutely no purpose (e.g. 100 trades of size 0.001 for the **same** price by the **same** trader with less than a second in between them can, and should be,  collected and executed as one trade)
EDIT: spelling, added a line, removed dickishness
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:08:55
yeah, I figured it would be ranked by "country". Problem is, for many purposes, the EU acts (almost) like a country, so for example for someone located in Germany, getting money into bitstamp is as easy as getting it into/out of a German exchange. 
But I don't want to look like I'm nagging. Great site!

Wow.  I love it. And the charity thing is really, really smart.
I have some minor critical points: 
- maybe mention that this is actually "for real" (it is, right?), i.e. that you really made a (small) donation. people might think it's a demo otherwise that doesn't do anything
- I'd advise to say maybe one more sentence about *real* wallets, and how they are "super secure" because of encryption.. just make up some nice sounding lines :). BUT that the security of your real bitcoin wallet depends on either how you store your private key, or if you use an online wallet, how strong your password is. Just prepare people for the fact that it won't be just as easy as the drag&amp;drop thing they can do with your temp wallet, but that they need to apply some common sense and use a strong password.
Finally, this would really benefit from being translated to some other major languages, no?

I'm talking about the wild ride (down, up, etc) after we hit 250.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:21:42
It might fall again, and it might rise again a bit, but to me it looks a lot like the market tested out the bottom (50 USD was never really reached), and the top (100 USD seems to high, for now).
From this point on, I expect the market to converge around 70. Not saying it won't continue to grow, but slower. Not even ruling out another bubble, but probably not right now. Just saying that, at the moment, I'm under the impression the market has found its temporary equilibrium.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:04:07
Any chance you could stay polite?
No, I'm not mad. Put things in perspective, please. 2 days ago, bitcoins were suddenly valued at 250 USD. They violently crashed, as we all know. Some people started speculating that the price will drop all the way down to single digit dollar values, maybe even less than a dollar, because, according to them the trust in bitcoins was completely destroyed.
If I'm right, and it will stay in the range I suggested for the coming days, maybe weeks, that would be quite a bit more stable than many suggested.
Is it stable enough to invest your entire savings in it? Obviously not. Bitcoin won't be that kind of stable for a long time. But stable enough not to worry if tomorrow a bitcoin will be back to one dollar: yes, I believe that's going to happen now.
@_date: 2013-10-03 11:55:54
Much higher than volume on April 10 even.
Makes me think the main reason why volume was comparably low on mtgox was that people there (for obvious reasons) are wary of letting their coins go.
Anyway, at least for selling coins, bitstamp is now the no.1 exchange :D (I know, you could already see that before, but the volume yesterday really drove home that point.)
P.S. hi, fellow bitcointalk refugees
EDIT: for fairness sake, volume was still higher on mtgox in absolute terms. relative to previous volume though, it was much larger on bitstamp
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:17:15
Exactly. That will be organic growth, and it will continue. But the sudden breathless race to 250 and the explosive burst of that bubble was anything but organic, and it's over now, I believe. Back to more sustainable growth, I hope.

Others already mentioned a few big names (amazon, ebay, etc.), but I'm not sure how realistic this is right now.
Here's a company that I feel *could* realistically be convinced to accept btc, and it would be both a great signal and pretty convenient: Google, and in particular: Google Play.

Mmmh. Hearing the word "cromulence" always embiggens my happiness.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:00:19
Just read your link. Until now, I was reluctant to believe in market manipulation (via micro order spam) as the explanation of the crash, but your evidence looks rather convincing to me.
So shouldn't this be easily solvable? Sure, exchanges have to be careful not to implement too draconic measures and destroy the ability of honest traders to do their job. But there are several good approaches, it seems. 
One (as was pointed out before) would be to demand a small fixed fee for each transaction, making it more costly for spammers to perform such an attack. 
Alternatively, and perhaps a bit more elegant would be implementing an algorithm that evaluates, based on a traders current behavior, this trader's "spam potential". Based on a few simple heuristics (number of orders per hour of that trader, average size of orders) the algorithm assigns each trader some numerical value that expresses how much like a "spammer" the trader behaves. Then, if the trading system starts suffering from lags, each trader whose "spam potential" number has reached a certain threshold will see his ability to buy/sell throttled (but the effect wears off over time). 
That should pretty much stop the problem immediately. I simply don't see which incentive for example mtgox could have *not* to take such precautions. There would be the occasional false positive, but I'm sure the vast majority of (honest) traders would greet such an anti-spam measure with open arms. What prevents the big exchanges from implementing such trivial measures against manipulation?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:55:17
Compared to a 50-something% drop, followed by a 40-something% recovery, and a few more big swings: yes, I would call that stable. Relatively stable, if you prefer.
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:19:54
I'm sorry, but that doesn't make any sense. At all.
Sure, the creators made some simplifying assumptions, but it's not coincidence that they chose to compare the cost of a 51% network attack with military budgets.
So your first point about "out-competing" rivals, and needing to earn enough money to be profitable, is simply irrelevant here. The scenario described here is, presumably, that a large government agency decides to "take over the network".
 ~500M USD or so is all that's necessary. A tiny fraction of, for example, the US military budget. Profitability is not the issue, since it would be politically motivated ("protection against money laundering", etc). Acquiring enough computing power isn't the issue either, if small-ish private companies were able to design and produce ASICs, so can a large enough government agency with enough funding.
For now, I'd say it's rather unlikely that some government sees bitcoin as a big enough threat to pour 500M USD into an attack. That might change though once bitcoin becomes more widely used, and used for more high-profile criminal activities (say, the first time some large terrorism attack has been partly funded by bitcoin, for example).
So the only "protection" I see at the moment is this: network composition. We generally know who has how much mining power. Assuming that the big players of today are not already "corrupted", any massive new influx of computing power would either have to join one of the existing groups (in which case the group members would notice if their pool is being abused), or create a new pool, which would raise suspicion if it comes out of nowhere, outcomputes everyone else, and doesn't have any previously known miners in it.

Not likely that it's an attack. Go take a look, all the major charting/stat sites are down as well. Bitcointalk as well. It's unlikely someone attacking the trading sites would, just for good measure, attack the forums and chart sites as well. No, the sad truth is, herd instincts have taken over and people desperately try to sell, hammering the servers and as a result increasing the panic.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:17:30
Complete agreement. Wrote something similar a few days ago in a different thread: reasonably secure system (Linux, properly updated) + proven, open source thin client software like Electrum = enough safety for most people with amounts less than 100k coins, IMO. Not everyone in the Bitcoin community agrees with that however.
EDIT: get a cheap netbook. install x/lubuntu. install electrum. set daily autoupdate frequency for OS. give netbook to your mother/father/grandparents. done.
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:03:36
At least for those based in Europe, bitstamp is the better option I'd say: zero cost &amp; fast wire transfers via SEPA, and if you're new to bitcoin, i.e. more likely to be a buyer, it's also way cheaper (per coin) than mtgox, and has been so for months.
Maybe I'm biased, since I personally use bitstamp. Still, I think even the pro-mtgox crowd will admit that, right now, if you're about to buy your first coins, then mtgox probably isn't the best option -- too much uncertainty regarding their fiat status, and higher prices to boot.

Interesting. That's one of the things I've wondered about before. I don't think I'm comfortable running an exit node, after reading a bit about the legal complications that can result. But I wouldn't mind running Tor as a "regular" node. 
Can you give a quick explanation what would happen if the majority of exit nodes were compromised, but the nodes in the middle would be largely not compromised. Is there a known attack that allows the owner of the exit nodes to identify Tor users at will, or is that scenario considered safe?

Happy to see that traffic is spiking. But who runs this site? Is there a way to not make mtgox pretty much the top option for exchanges? 
I'm not hating on mtgox, but I think there are better options currently, and certainly *cheaper* exchanges to buy your first bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-20 16:41:04
I like it. A lot. 
Very well designed, and pretty smart to mention your "Stammtisch" right in the beginning... makes it sound relatable, and non-threatening, to the random passerby reading it, which is important IMO.
One point of criticism though: I'm not too fond of the slogan "Unser Geld. Frei, sicher, global. Werde Teil der Revolution."
First, I personally would have avoided the word "revolution". Call me conservative, but I believe the majority of people on the street will mainly have negative associations with that term, even if they will come to understand how revolutionary bitcoin really is.
But in the end, that's a bit of a matter of taste.
More importantly is, I think, is the following: I think it is a good idea to almost always mention, prominently, the **inflation free nature** of bitcoin.
All economic fine details aside, that's one of the biggest selling points for bitcoin in my opinion for the average joe. Example: I recently told my mother about bitcoin. She didn't care much about the mathematical beauty of the protocol. She didn't care much about the ability to transfer wealth globally, with low transactions costs.
But she *did* become interested when I told her that, as a result of the fact that the number of "coins" is eternally limited (let's say, they are, and that part of the protocol never changes), there can never be the same inflation we know from our current money.
Don't underestimate this effect on people. A lot of economically relatively conservative people could become interested in this if they understand that part. Think the stereotypical German "Sparer". They *hate* the fact that, even in the absence of hyperinflation, their hard-earned belongings shrink in value by about 1 or 2% each year. If we tell them that bitcoin is like money, but without the permanent loss of value, they'll bite.
Pretty long post, sorry... anyway, here's an idea for a slogan that incorporates the inflation aspect: **"Unser Geld. Effizient, sicher und garantiert inflationsfrei."**
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:10:50
I get what you're saying but:


My Dutch isn't that great, but if I understood it correctly it says that, outside of the classroom setting &amp; the administration, "everyone is free to spell as he wishes".
Which is kind of my point: a) it's only orthography (something that linguists tend to consider a minor point of language anyway, since it's kind of arbitrary), and b) it's not even really legally binding.
But like I said, I get what you're saying. Germany had a "spelling reform" some years ago, and that one also gave people the impression the state is managing/interfering with their language.

Don't know about your family OP, but where I'm from declaring *any* well-meant present "not a good gift" just isn't a thing you do. But maybe that's just my weird family tradition :/
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:16:29
yes, that's a very good point: the site does what it *can* do: determines the character set that your password is chosen from, and the length of the sequence.
any half-decent password cracking algorithm will include a way to look for repeating patterns, so the "hahaha..." password would (probably) be trivially easy.
That said, a long enough *sufficiently random* sequence of pure alphabetic characters (a-z), not even including capitalization, can be very secure.
Here's a common suggestion: get a big enough dictionary. open pages at random, point with a pencil at random words. Being human, the result won't be *truly* random, but close enough, and if you chose enough words, the overall entropy will be good enough. chose, say 10 or more words like that, and under pretty much all reasonable attack scenarios, you should be secure.
EDIT: bonus points for including words from more than one language :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:13:44
Point taken. The "proof" argument muddles up the (relevant) microtransaction argument with some (incomprehensible) argument about much bigger orders.
I don't see how the paragraph you quote contradicts that though, because it does in fact describe the method that some users think triggered (not caused) the crash: dominate the order book with (tiny) trades at 106 when the "real" price, i.e. the price established by trades with some actually relevant size was around 150, in order to give the appearance that the price just dropped drastically.
[This comment]( is a much mor concise, less sensationalist summary of the argument that the market that day was at least *influenced* by microtransaction spam.
Unless your point is that the paragraph you quote doesn't make clear that the argument is somewhat speculatory. Sure, but like I also said above: there is nothing to be **gained** from allowing 100s of microtransaction by the same trader for the same price during an already intense and laggy  time. 
Combine them, introduce a minimal fixed fee, throttle speed of traders that spam, do whatever you want -- the argument that those microtransactions should be limited at certain times does not rely on knowing with certainty that the spam triggered the crash, just that the *cost* of allowing this spam is much higher than the *benefits*, for the market as a whole.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:25:05
Depends what you mean by "other security".
If you run it on a Linux machine, say: xubuntu (lightweight Ubuntu), with the latest updates, and you use that machine for nothing but bitcoin transactions, you're pretty safe.
Note one thing: electrum doesn't by default encrypt your private keys, AFAIK. So after installing it, you should set a password that is required for sending from the addresses you control, in which case your private keys will be encrypted. 
Those two things, dedicated linux machine (can be a small cheap netbook) plus electrum with transaction password enabled should be safe enought for 99% of users.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:16:23
I understand the point you want to make, even though the way you do it is a bit shady. I mean, you can construct a line of best fit of *any* slope if you are free to arbitrarily select the time interval for that line. And there is nothing compelling about the fact that the current price is exactly back to what that line predicts -- in a minute it could be slightly higher or below again.
But I agree with what I think is your point: to me it seems that, at this point, any value above 20/25 USD is still perfectly in line with the organic growth of a currency that will be (relatively) stable in the long term.
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:39:22
If you're extremely concerned about security, that's probably not good enough. As others pointed out before, anything that can run on the one partition has (physical) access to the other.
That said, if you use electrum on the Linux partition, set a transaction password, and **make damn sure that your Electrum password is sufficiently strong**, you should be reasonably safe.
*Sidenote: I got downvotes in another comment for making a similar suggestion. I invite anyone to describe a (feasible!) attack vector from a dual boot setup, in which Bitcoin transactions are performed within the Linux environment, and the master seed of Electrum is encrypted.*
I cannot stress enough the importance of a properly chosen password: the entire 128-bit key strength of Electrum is pointless if your password is "abc553". [This site]( is one of the best password strength checkers in my opinion. Think of a password, and then enter **a variation of it** on that website to see if it's good enough. Your goal is to reach (or surpass) 128 bits of entropy. 
[this well-known xkcd]( gives a good example how to do this: chose a large enough sequence of sufficiently random words. The xkcd example, 4 words, is not good enough for our purposes. Fortunately, the human brain is pretty good at remembering even long sequences of natural language words.

@_date: 2013-05-02 07:41:10
The details of the article notwithstanding (actually, they're relatively favorable), **we need more articles like this**: talking about bitcoins in the context of real purchases ("living on bitcoins"), rather than constantly reporting on and analyzing the speculative aspect of it. The former will give the public the impression that bitcoins are just another Ponzi scheme, while the latter will hopefully make them interested in using it as real method of storing wealth and making transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:36:48
Yeah, I'm going to disagree with this.
There is a step between *web wallet* (generally a bad idea for anything larger than a bit of change) and *paper wallet*, in the sense of a physical document containing your keys.
Right now, I would suggest newcomers that deal with moderate amounts of btc to simply use one of the well-established Bitcoin clients: Bitcoin-Qt if you don't care about speed and it being somewhat cumbersome, but you want to go entirely trustless. MultiBit is an option as well. 
But my personal favorite right now would be [Electrum]( Very pleasant to handle, fast, and light-weight. Yes, you do have to trust a server when you want to perform a transaction, but your keys are stored (encrypted) on your own machine, the software itself is open source, and there is no *unique* server you have to trust, so the risk is small, I would say. Unless you deal in coins worth millions of USD, it's perhaps the best balance between security and ease of use at the moment.
**EDIT:** As others pointed out, what I recommend presupposes a secure system to work on. I forgot that part. So I will add: Run Electrum, **on a Linux machine/dual boot with Linux**.
