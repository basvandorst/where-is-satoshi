In short? Tax fraud.
Often times when large amounts of cash are involved, say to buy a car from a private party, it's to keep the actual transaction amount off record so fewer taxes need to be paid.

Plot twist: Many late model cars with manual throttle linkages and cruise control still have computer control over the throttle. How do you think cruise control works?

How exactly can you push the industry ahead if you don't know what you're pushing, where you're pushing it to, or why you'd even want to push it in the first place.
Uninformed actors with social skills are the bread and butter of Washington and she appears to be cut from the same cloth. Bitcoin is going decently well right now, we don't need someone like this fucking things up by misleading legislators or suggesting poor ideas.

I see what you're saying about how they went about deconstructing her. I haven't listened to this show before and don't know anything about them or if this is their MO. That said, I'd be frustrated too if I had a guest who was only interested in giving a fluff piece interview.

Actually _using_ it needs to stop being a yak shaving endeavor. Setting up wallets, backing up private keys/seed phrase, transaction fees, getting USD (or other fiat) containers linked up to deposit, correctly sending to the right recipient, etc. And then once someone does all that right, they're told "no no stupid, you should be using a hardware wallet" and their mental model of how all this works implodes again.
Circle was perhaps the closest at making this feel non-weird, but IMO we're still a bit off from the Venmo-esque easiness. The margin for error is very low with bitcoin transactions and it's non reversible, so many-a-noobs will unfortunately learn some hard lessons. I have faith though that some app/service will come along and make something well designed and organized that makes it easy for new users to get in. Gemini, while being an exchange, seems to have the design chops and thoughtfulness to pull this off. I wouldn't be surprised to see them offer an app that doesn't feel like a stock brokerage in the future.

Frankly I'm sick of price threads all together. Whether it's the memes or circle jerking, I'm tired of people yipping about prices. Talk about something constructive rather than chart-chasing.

If keys are shared then they're inherently not private.
If you're sending everyone a hardware wallet then how are you making money?
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:29:03
You might look into GDAX (Coinbase's exchange). They charge 0.25% and the BTC is closer to spot/market rate. Coinbase charges 3.99% + a slight markup on the BTC they sell you.

Oh cool, another exchange/"bank" that gives noobs the impression it's totally okay for them to not hold their private keys...only for the exchange to get hacked and yet another round of users gets soured on BTC.

How long does it take to get up to $3,000 for your rolling reup on Circle? I've been held at $300 for ~5 months.

So once my account got "verified" (which occurred after I had signed up, linked a bank account, and a human probably looked over my details), I was able to ACH in USD and buy BTC instantly. I can't transfer the BTC out of the exchange wallet until the ACH transfer clears (that's slow as shit but not Gemini's fault, banks take ~3 days for that typically) but the actual conversion/purchase of USD into BTC was instantaneous (and at a _really_ low fee over spot, like $1.25).
Once the ACH clears I'll move it to my own wallet (and probably a hardware wallet once I get one) as it generally doesn't seem like a good idea to hold coins in exchange wallets if you don't need to.
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:33:52
What are their fees? And in your experience how close has their BTC price been compared to spot?
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:12:46
Just wanted to chime in with a datapoint that Gemini has been very smooth for me via ACH after signing up earlier in the week. Wish they had an app. I previously used Circle and Coinbase. Also, Gemini's significantly lower fees compared to those two are very attractive.

We’re talking about personal choice though. We don’t have the market penetration here yet to say “well someone could pay solely by QR code/digital cash exclusively in the US if they wanted to.”
Also, credit cards work _really_ well. So whatever comes along has to be more streamlined and bulletproof than that. Apple Pay/Google Pay is getting there, but again, it’s not everywhere. China basically went from cash to WeChat/QR payments from what I understand.
@_date: 2019-04-29 14:29:08
You write in how much tip you want to apply on the receipt they bring you after they ring up your card for the bill. After you leave or at the end of the night, they then amend the charge to represent the final total inclusive of tip. I know it sounds sketchy but like I said, after _thousands_ of tx like this I think I’ve had maybe one (a bar) that fucked it up.

Did they look like [this?](
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:49:03
Yep that’s fair. These apps unfortunately don’t really come into play in a retail setting.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:56:23
I disagree with that notion. I’d say the norm is for young people with phones to pay each other with Venmo/PayPal/Square Cash/Chase Pay/etc.
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:52:34
See my [other]( comment. I was mainly responding to the notion that people "aren't using payment apps by choice" in the US.

It’s not just restaurants. It’s everywhere. I hate it too, but it’s ingrained in our culture (and economy) and isn’t going away any time soon.

I'm going to say I've probably done somewhere between 1,000-1,500 credit card transactions in the past year. A good number of those were online, but a bunch were in person (stores, dining, gas stations, etc). 
Without fail the cards that always get ganked are the ones I typically only use at gas stations. The pumps are just easy targets sitting there unattended at night, so they often get skimmers installed in them. Slowly the companies are adding contactless payment to the pumps, in fact I just used Apple Pay for the first time at a station the other month, so this problem will eventually be eradicated.
Meanwhile, the cards that I put "in the line of fire" so to speak at restaurants never have issues. I know it has happened, and probably still does, but it's very rare. And in most cases the credit card companies don't bat an eye at it if you _do_ have fraud, and will rule in your favor as soon as you report fraud. There's also something slightly less awkward about not having the waiter stand over you as you conduct the transaction, plus in America we tip so you generally don't have to alert the waiter to what kind of tip you're giving them in our system (you just write it on the receipt and leave it -- they find out later).
Anyway, the point is: yes, our system is less efficient and less secure than having the payment terminal brought to you. But it works, and in an overwhelming majority of cases, it works well (or well enough). Don't mistake me for saying it can't be better, I'll welcome with open arms any kind of contactless payment setups, QR codes, whatever. But it's going to take a while for my fellow countrymen to see the point of shifting from how we currently do things.
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:22:59
You're telling me things I already know. Credit/debit cards are accepted _just about_ everywhere in the US, and they "work" (scare quotes because fraud is still obviously a problem).
I like using Apple Pay when I can, but there are still just so many things that it's not available to pay with. Take any kind of sit down restaurant, for example. In most other parts of the world, if the restaurant accepts credit/debit cards, the waiter brings the payment terminal _to you_ so you can pay right at the table. In the US, you give your card to the waiter, they take it to the back and charge your bill to the card, then return your card to you. 
To make something like Apple Pay work in that context in the US would require restaurants to start carrying mobile payment terminals like elsewhere in the world. Could they start adding QR codes to all of the tables? Sure, but there are onboarding hurdles with that too.
It's not that it's an insurmountable task, it just takes time and more importantly incentive for the shift to happen.

You're not wrong, but Facebook's rampant and relentless copying of Snapchat via Instagram has closed a lot of ground. Insta Stories has more daily active users now than Snap.  Granted, the demos probably aren't identical (Snap's still being younger) but Instagram is definitely in the process of eating Snap's lunch.

You’re proving my point. I interpreted his comment as “people aren’t using things like Venmo because they don’t want to” and I was attempting to disprove that assertion.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:46:25
It looked like the first time she was doing it, honestly. I’d imagine your average Joe using Venmo for the first time, or worse, trying to figure out how to setup and pay someone through iMessage with Apple Pay would take longer.
