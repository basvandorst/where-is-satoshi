Shouldn't your lack of faith be the result of Mt. Gox still being the dominant exhange, after multiple fuck-ups?

That's a cool story, but it presupposes that the banks and credit card networks are powerless to participate. Do you doubt for a second that if Visa wanted to acquire 10,000 ASICs and obliterate the market they couldn't do it? As BTC becomes more mainstream, it'll be absorbed by interests that will monetize it. Bitcoin isn't some magic swords wielded only by nerds and libertarians: it's a totally fair game, and like most games, the more resources you have to play with, the better.

I appreciate the critical thinking, but don't assume it's all a scam. (Not sure where you get your "trillions" from)
I have a pretty serious medical condition (not cancer), and within the last year, the first medicine to actually treat the underlying genetic defect was released. This came from a $75M investment by the primary foundation. Medicine development *is* expensive.

It's not that hard to explain, if you put it in non-technical terms. At its basic level, it's not technical. It's about a currency based on trust. 
An analogy I use: "Imagine you have someone verify that $5 bill is legit. Every once in a while, someone gets a $100 bill. Since the $100 bill is kinda uncommon, folks agree to team up and split the $100 amongst the team."
If you start with the technology or talking fiat, you'll lose them due to cognitive noise.

What % of the active traders are on Mt. Gox? That's the problem - it makes them an easy target. If they were one of many moderate sized exchanges, it would make DDoS'ing for profit harder. For BTC to succeed, even Mt. Gox has to get government-level durable, or their market share needs to drop to less than 20%. That would probably crush prices over the short term, but result in longer term stability of BTC. After all, everyone who says they're in it for the long term isn't concerned with daily price fluctuations, right?

What's LOL is the fact that people keep giving them money
