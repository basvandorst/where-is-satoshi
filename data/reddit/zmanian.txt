Read the document. It might be something to talk to your tax account about.

One of your observations is that the difference between tax regulation currency and property rests on medium term inflationary expectations. The asymptotic decline in the rate of minting in the bitcoin blockchain sets expectations that inflations rate is expected to decline. Alt blockchains are setting their inflationary expectations in different ways. Dogecoin, Ethereum etc are setting inflationary expectations but are viable capital investments because of expectation of demand for liquidity.  
Maybe this has practical effects under the current legal structure. Does the inflationary structure of Dogecoin cause it to naturally converge towards a currency like tax treatment i.e. because you'll always have fiat losses relative to doge over the medium term?
It seems like treating cryptocurrencies as property is the most flexible tax treatment for the spectrum of crypto use cases.

Who is "they" in your question? As mentioned in the article, business activities in the popular cryptocurrencies are conducted essentially in public.

It worth reviewing this thread on ModernCrypto.
Some key takeaways:
The way large scale email service providers work is
- All deliverable SMTP traffic is signed at the domain level by the SMTP server. Key discovery via DKIM.
- Large Scale email providers track reputation by domain and by individual address and also look at plain text content when available. This is "good enough".
- In a pervasive E2E + decentralization context, this good enough may no longer be as useful.
- Reputation could be migrated to user level PKI
- E2E spam is not yet a problem but it will be if we win.
- The most immediately useful thing for heavy crypto users would be ordering of messages from messages not current in trusted list.

The point is your anonymity on the Bitcoin network is provisional at best. Businesses and individuals face the same reporting obligations with Bitcoin as they do with other economic activities. This is an attempt to determine exactly what those obligations are.

I'd love a better explanation of this.
