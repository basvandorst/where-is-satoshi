I used to have a similar setup with an offline system running Armory.  Since then I have moved my funds to (albeit less secure) a ledger wallet.

The only way I see these kind of bills working in real market situation is if these are backed by some kind of legitimate bitcoinbank . Bank issues these notes backed by bitcoin, the bill has some form of unique ID for point of sale scanners. The bank has some high speed database meant for checking if specific bill has been opened or not. IF user want to extract the bitcoin he would have to tear the bill to extract the private key, which is part of multisig, upon extraction owner of bill get 95% of stored fund and bank get 5% (don't know if this is programmable with current version of bitcoin) this (whatever)% for the bank is for damage to the bils and to encourage that people use the bills.

it does not really matter in regards to segwit or unlimited. Though I would recommend you look into hardware wallets. Also why do you need to use an old address?
