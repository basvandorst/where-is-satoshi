It's extremely stable, it doesn't corrode, and is an excellent electricity conductor.

Errr... What's the challenge with sequencing DNA? We've been doing it for a while. There must be additional hurdles the data scientist created.

But it's a different exchange so you'd need to transfer to your gemini account right? What'd the fees be?

Is there anything similar for Europeans?

What if the miners switch to another coin? What if a really bad 0-day exploit is found?
We can afford banks to go bankrupt, it happens regularly and they're bailed out. You cannot afford bitcoin to get compromised.

 &gt;Bitcoin is going to be the most disruptive and freeing technology ever. 
It's cute but there is no point, almost nobody needs trustless transactions. Our whole system is built on trust, and it works pretty well, unless you're trying to buy/sell illegal stuff (the only sector disrupted by bitcoin yet). Making transactions irreversible is incredibly dangerous, and the reason why I won't touch it with a 10 foot pole. If my bank account gets hacked, I get my money back instantly. Bitcoin cannot beat that.
Blockchain can be useful to solve a few problems (tracing back goods for example), but it's a shitty way to store wealth.
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:20:55


You heard of SEPA transfer? Free and instant. It is done in Europe, it can be done elsewhere.


Neither can they trust Bitcoin for that, as we've all witnessed for the last 2 years


Been existing for more than 10 years amd blockchains are even older, I'd hardly call that incredibly early.


WTF are you saying, of course it can be hacked, exactly 0 program is hack proof. It got hacked very early after its creation for example: 


Incredibly more complex and unsafe than say, opening a bank account, we've seen so many pre-compromosed wallet apps and hardware. 
Bitcoin is a solution in need of a problem.
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:25:19


Like when Coincheck of Bitfinex compensated victims with other users's funds after getting hacked?

You're being silly friend, you don't need to know your key (yikes) but you definitely need to access it, be it on a piece of paper or tattooed on your dog. A good little torture session will make sure you tell where it can be found.

@_date: 2019-08-21 06:44:21


Looks like somebody forgot that if you forget/lose your wallet keys, the BTC in it will never get out, and you've effectively burned that BTC and reduced the supply. As time passes, more people lose their shit, so a BTC is certainly not 1/21000000 of the supply

I think he means that he won't buy additional coins with cash, he only sells high and rebuy low, without withdrawing money.

I used to want to do that on coinbase, but you pay fees at every step, when you sell and when you buy, it seriously diminishes your profits. Transfer your funds to GDax for free and do it here, the fees are typically 25-50cts, 0 if you make a limit buy.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:10:51
Because it will cost society less to help the guy, compared to letting him slowly die with a myriad of shitty health problems that will greatly diminish the possibility of him ever contributing positively to the world.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:53:10
Register at GDax (more serious exchange owned by coinbase), transfer your coins there for free instantly, then you can transfer it again to the wallet of your choosing, that you control, for free again.
If you skip this step and transfer via coinbase, you're gonna pay fees.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:29:44
I don't see an exchange only available in 5 US states kill anything

Even if that was true, we're veeeery far from ever being as dangerous as the US...

Currently live in the UK, I concur. In France tough, I've never seen a single credit card, it's all debit. We actually mean debit card when we say "carte de crédit".
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:04:01
I guess they aren't made to be used as a day trading exchange, that's why they have GDax for. But yeah those fees are fucked

Retarded reasoning, evolution doesn't work like that. If you're able to reproduce before the problems stemming from your genetics arise, then you're going  to transmit them ad infinitum. Otherwise we'd have much less genetic illnesses as we have now.

 Am scientist too, and that's a totally made-up number. Genetics vs environment influence vary greatly depending on the issue you're looking at, it can be mostly one, the other or a combination of both. It's an insanely difficult question to answer.
