Yeah, ok. You want to pay your rent with an ever changing value of currency? You want to trust that your paycheck is accurate with an ever changing value of currency? The dollar works because we can calculate inflation easily, roughly 3-5% yearly. What about market shifts of 3-7% daily! So when your paycheck comes in every two weeks are you paid at the value of currency during each day worked or at the time the check is cut? Someone is going to come out ahead and someone is going to come out behind with a fluctuating currency like btc. You gotta make a choice: security or currency? Which do you want?

So why is everyone concerned with its value tie to the USD?
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:09:02
That’s why we need a coin that people stop trading. It’s why the dollar is the world currency. The value of a dollar is a dollar because we the people agree that it is a dollar. The reason we need to get rid of the dollar is because we print it without proper oversight. 
Do you think that one of those alt coins that puts more coins into the market each year is a solution to the investment problem that is plaguing most coins today? Somehow, someway we need to abandon this hodl mentality.

You are missing the point of BTC being a replacement to cash. The localized currency will be btc. You’re think 2018 and I’m thinking 2028 for long term adoption. The speculation must stop or a different coin with a stabilized value must be used as currency.

Really, it has nothing to do with the charts. It has everything to with how the HODL crew views the coin. How are they buying lambos with their bitcoin? By selling it off for fiat that’s how. Bitcoin is not a currency right now. It’s a financial instrument for fiat currency. That is until the HODL crowd gets burned badly and we can start using it or another coin in a stable fashion. 
All currencies are somewhat tied to one another in the Forex market.

I believe that’s exactly what I’m doing now. Stop hodling and start spending

Bitcoin doesn’t have any true value right now. It’s tied to fiat in a huge way. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:56:51
That is not true at all. There are the types of securities and currency does not fall into any category. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:17:03
That doesn’t fix the problem of people using bitcoin like a security instead of a currency. The value of the coin has to remain stable for use as a currency. Also, imagine going to the store and paying for something for 0.0047 btc. Enjoyed y calculating that in your head for errors. But then a few minutes later that price is now 0.0055btc. How does the store advertise it’s pricing? Hell, how do you adjust the rate at which you pay your mortgage each month? How about the rate at which you get paid by your employer? If BTC rises by 7% during a pay period do you get paid the entire 7% increase or do we now have to calculate your wages based on each day you work? There’s just no way of using a wildly fluctuating coin like bitcoin as a form of currency. You’re focused on the tech and transactions speed when you also need to focus on real world application.

You pretty well summed up this entire sub ��
@_date: 2018-08-15 12:31:11
I firmly believe that bitcoin will be treated like gold and an alt coin will be treated like cash. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:59:23
You are preaching to the choir my friend. I feel like there might be some alts out there that exemplify a stable currency better than bitcoin. Growth of those coins, however, might cause speculation and we’d end up at square one. Monero and stellar come to mind (I’m not holding either for the record). 
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:49:36
The long term adoption of crypto aka satoshi’s vision was for crypto to be a currency replacement to fiat. If you treat it like a security it will be tied to fiat instead of replacing it. Currency needs to be spent and cycled. Not hoarded and speculated against. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:15:21
Very well thought out post! I’m going to say that bitcoin has been adopted by the market as a security. There’s no chance of that changing due to the mainstream popularity. I feel as though a different coin with better tech will be utilized for daily spending. Isn’t there an alt that releases a set amount of additional coins through mining each year forever? That could be a mechanism to thwart speculation. I don’t know if that’s the answer, however. What other financial mechanisms can stabilize a currency? The country of Zimbabwe and Columbia are dying to know this answer as well ��

You told me to fuck off. Why do you think I’d enjoy that and provide you upvotes? 
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:55:00
Exactly! These people only want to get rich quick. They are gambling/investing. Bitcoin was meant to be currency, not a security. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:33:27
Why are there 11 candles tho? Is satoshi trying to tell us something??? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:51:34
I make a new account every year or so. What’s that got to do with it?
