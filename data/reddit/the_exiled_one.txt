Can it recognize stuff like $2.5k?

Let's try again ;)
4m dollar

So how does this actually work?

A perfect antivirus cannot exist. 
Proof by counterexample:
Assume A is a perfect antivirus. 
Using A on a code will tell you whether it is a virus or not.
Now assume the following virus code with the malicious fragment V:
    if A identifies V as a virus do nothing; otherwise do V.
Now there are two possibilities: either this virus is not detected by A, or it is, but then it's a false alarm; therefore A is not perfect, which contradicts the assumption. QED

You may be experiencing the error described [here](

Aye. Btw I found out that bitvisitor pays after you've reached 100 µBTC. I updated my script to better show your current profit.
@_date: 2013-06-13 13:35:06
Sorry for responding so late. Yeah, bitivisitor seems to delay payments for me, too. Sometimes for weeks even! I wouldn't rely on them too much for getting your hands on bitcoins, there are better ways e.g. mining.

When I get some free time, I'll probably build a Java application that will combine several of such services.

I filtered the view to this particular user to better get the point across.

You've got a typo in the fifth step of your info graphic.
It should read

As concerns click fraud: 
Firstly, the script is primarily for when you already visited all the bitcoin-relevant sites presented in bitvisitor, and just want to earn a little something without staring at the same sites over and over again. 
And secondly, it doesn't say anywhere you must glance at the browsed sites with thou own eyes; as a matter of fact, bitvisitor doesn't even have any formally laid out rules. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:11:08
Well, there are code-reuse attacks, which can turn any program into a virus - your browser, your email client, even your operating system.
@_date: 2013-01-03 13:20:10
I have made a small python script to make earning with bitvisitor easier. You can check it out here:  
I suppose I could also make such scripts for other sites as well, but I wanted to try it on just one first. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:52:06
I'm sorry, but I don't see any html code on that page, only javascript.
@_date: 2013-01-05 18:04:57
Initially the script used Tor, but the site always recognized the connections as proxies and blocked them, so there was nothing I could do. 
Also, the script is not intended to be run as multiple instances from one IP because bitvisitor uses both the IP and bitcoin address to identify a unique user. This might also be a clue to your exiting with 0.00 mBTC.

I don't quite understand what you're saying. 
But let me give you an example: 
The firefox browser is not a malware, a small valid-html file that I have is also not malicious - it can be displayed by opera, chrome and even internet explorer without any problems; if opened with firefox, however, the computer will freeze up until you manually reboot it (tested on win and mac). 
Should then firefox be classified as malware in your opinion?
@_date: 2013-01-03 19:42:27
Thanks for your appreciation, and yes - it was indeed a fun little project. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:45:25
There is no way for pure html to check what browser it is displayed in.
Browsers are required to be compliant with the html standard.

I like how you spelled "spelled" as "spelt" and "learned" as "learnt". 
Today I learnt that it can be spelt both ways.

Not that I disagree with your statement, but the research method you used might be biased because of a [filter bubble]( you were in at the time of search. 
(More accurate results could be produced, if you were to repeat the search query several times from different proxies, and then averaged the result).
