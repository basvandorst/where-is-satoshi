I don't think you realize how long it took for Ethernet to become the Internet, or for something like ICQ or AOL messenger to become whatsapp/facebook.
These things take time, the protocol stack isn't ready for *any* cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin. and the software stack itself isn't ready either.
When you can send crypto in a messenger app, or you can use it via an assistant like alexa, siri, etc. you know crypto will be ready for mainstream adoption. And we're not there yet, not by a long shot. We're years away.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:19:25


Crypto will be the currency of choice of AGIs and DAOs. We have pretty much invented the perfect currency for them.
We've had software that can beat people on Jeopardy for years, and more recently a game like go. And you have trouble believing that in 10 years we'll have "assistants" that will be able to learn your habits, usual mistakes, cravings, fears, etc? It's already happening.
Not sure if such an assistant will be an AGI or not, but it will know you better than you know yourself on many regards, and it will be more eloquent than you are. (and it will speak every language on earth to boot) 
We already have voice assistants that almost sound human like already:
Pretty soon they'll even do things like simulate breathing to sound even more realistic. (I think some alrorithims do already, actually)
So like I said. Who knows if we'll have an AGI in 10 years. But we don't need an AGI for something like the smart assistant/wallets I'm describing, those can be achieved with a lot less than that.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:15:37

@_date: 2018-01-02 07:49:30


The hardware wallet itself will be simple, and so will the soft components, they'll just be much more usable than the shit that is out there right now.


in 5 years voice assistants will be more eloquent and smarter than you, in 10 years they'll be smarter than all of us collectively.
Don't assume things will stay the way they are. AI is on the exponential bandwagon, and eventually they'll know you better than you know yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:22:25
That's fine, most people didn't use the internet until Facebook was a thing, you're just going to be one of the users that gets onboarded when crypto goes mainstream since it's too complex for you atm.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:59:05


Your lack of imagination is disturbing.
A hardware wallet is nothing but a computer that never goes on the internet, that's it's main feature. 
Hardware wallets *today* can be used with different software, and that's all a smart wallet would be, software that can be used with your existing  and future hardware wallets.
I run into people like you all the time. Some people just lack imagination. If you really think hardware wallets in their current state are as good as it needs to get, there is nothing left to talk about.

Be patient. Rome wasn't built in one day. 
We could take the easy route and just make Bitcoin more centralized to be faster. But this has never been what Bitcoin is about. If we go that route, we'll just end up with paypal.
Honestly, it's not nearly as bad as it seems. The current situation would be a really bad one if crypto had gone mainstream and we lived in a world where you had to use it to buy everything in your life.
But we're not there yet, and it's not just because of the scaling issue. It's actually more to do with the shity interface on top of the protocol, it sucks right now.
By the time crypto is as easy to use as an app like facebook, whatsapp, snapchat, etc. (which will take crypto to mainstream adoption) The scaling issue will have also been solved.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:54:37

Yes, because simple means better, amirite?
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:50:01
Serious problems?
Nothing has changed in the Bitcoin network itself. The only thing that has changed is the huge influx of new users on the network.
And as everyone that has done their due diligence knows:
Blockchains suck at scaling. So the problems you talk about are hardly surprising. You would also know that L2 solutions that *will* make Bitcoin scale are very close to release.
But yeah, let's talk about the "serious problems" you are doing nothing about to solve.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:01:27


Alright then, let's just compromise the security of the network to make you feel better.
If you want to simply dismiss the scaling solutions for Bitcoin because they are not available right this second for you to feel better, that's fine. Sell of your BTC, and go use some ghost town alt coin that has no network congestion instead.
Meanwhile, the rest of us will wait patiently for the L2 solutions instead of yell "the sky is falling" and beating a dead horse.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:40:56
No, not really.
Ventrilo and teamspeak are what you could call a very rudementary version of something like discord, which takes the concept of group chat to a whole new level.
Ventrilo and teamspeak have pretty much the same functionality, but aren't nearly as user friendly or feature packed, which makes the adoption of those early attempts much lower than something like Discord.
With wallets, there is even more to improve:
We need easier ways to keep our funds safe with out compromising security, there's a lot to be done in just that one thing.
There is also the need to have wallets that prevent you from fucking up a transfer. (like say... having a wallet that warns you that you're sending more than you probably mean to, to say, a twitch streamer, etc)
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:04:27
That sucks man. I had my two most profitable days of mining worth of BTC with then (around 110 bucks) I could've withdrawn Monday's gains, but the second payment (which was already over 60 bucks) wasn't due for another two hours.
Not that it would have mattered, since my plan was to withdraw until the next Monday. So i guess In a way, even though I lost the best 2 days I've had. It could've been worse if it happened on Sunday.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:55:34
I agree that the LN is extremely important for enabling mass adoption. But really, the LN is just another step on a long ladder.
The biggest issue right now, in my view, are wallets. Wallets are too complicated to use currently, and securing your coins is too hard.
The current interface is barely better than using a command line, since you can easily fuck up and lose all of your funds.
We need wallets that are as easy to use as a voice assistant (google now, siri, alexa, etc) but are way smarter than current assistants. And for GUI wallets we need them to be as easy to use as some of the most popular social apps, such as wassap.
I would be very surprised if there aren't developers tackling this issue right now, because the current wallets are all just a terrible user experience.
Wallets are begging for the top talent from silicon valley to step in and show the incumbents how it's done.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:38:35


Future wallets will be to current Bitcoin wallets, what an application like discord is to old voice apps like ventrilo or teamspeak.
Sure, Ventrilo and Teamspeak do the same thing as Discord. But they're on a completely different league when it comes to usability and interface to name just a few advantages.


I figure a lot of people might not see where I'm coming from, so I'll give you an example:
An assistant (which could support hardware wallets by the way, by just asking you to confirm transactions by clicking on them) that is smart enough to act as your wallet would be amazing. Because it would make sure you don't do stupid mistakes, like sending more than you meant to, in situations such as:
"hmm, I'm going to send this twitch streamer some Bitcoin, because I really like his content"
The assistant then would realize that the person you are trying to send your Bitcoin to, is in fact, a twitch streamer. At which point it would ask you:
"Hey, the person you are trying to send money to is a known twitch streamer, are you sure you want to send a $300 dollar donation, or did you mean 3 dollars but mistakenly tried to send him more?
At which point, you would realize you fucked up the quantity of BTC you wanted to send, and tell the assistant "yep, I meant 3 dollars, thanks for noticing"
It's a common mistake, and you can think of many other similar examples where having a smart wallet, would save you from doing either poor choices, or mistakes.
Such as a smart wallet noticing that you're about to buy something online that is overpriced, or out of stock or any other details you might miss that would make it a bad purchase.
And as far as what I mean by applications like "wassap" (or snapchat, etc, etc)
That's even easier. On whatsapp your contact list contains a lot of people you might need to send money to, for any number of reasons, such as:
Raising funds for a party, sending money to a family member, or maybe even helping a friend in a ditch, like:
 "Hey bro, I'm almost out of gas, and I don't have access to any of my funds right now, can you please send me some BTC?, I'll pay you when I get home"
Right now, it's extremely easy to send pictures, links or videos to anyone in your contact list in those applications. So what if those applications had a wallet component to them, such as a built in softwallet, and hardware wallet support?
Then it would be as easy to send your friends, (or group of friends) money for whatever reason you can think off, just as easy as sending a picture, link, video, etc.
Another example is wassap groups, where friends on a group could chip in funds for "the game" or "the cookout", etc.


And what exactly, do you think would prevent hardware wallet support in an application like wassap or an AI assistant?
Hardware wallets are nothing but offline computers. And once crypto gets popular enough, having a "hardware wallet" component in your smart phone would be piece of cake:
A phone manufacturer could decide to add very small second screen on your phone that is never connected to the internet, and if they decouple things like touch ID from the main OS, and make it work as a device that just signs transactions, and allows logins, etc. 
That way your login credentials (such as your fringerprint) would never be on the internet or the main OS (I suspect this is already the case) and neither would your crypto keys.
TL;DR- Crypto will go mainstream when it's just as easy to send secure funds, as it is sending a cat picture on a social media app.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:28:03
you mean 14k
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:29:55


But it is FUD. The Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are the only networks under significant use. Which is why they are the only networks suffering from scaling issues.
Again, if you had done your due diligence, you would know this isn't surprising and in fact expected:
Blockchains don't scale very well.
And sure, you can go for short term fixes like making blocks bigger; but it wouldn't solve the scaling problem in the long term with out sacrificing decentralization.
So your "objective facts" aren't news to anyone that has done their homework. And if you had done your homework, you would know that the scaling issue has been known for years, and for years there have been solutions in the works that are finally close to completion.
Everyone that is investing in Bitcoin for the long term *should* do their due diligence. Otherwise you'll be scared into selling by half-assed opinions claiming that Bitcoin is in trouble because of X and Y. when solutions have been in development for years.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:24:58

"insider trading" isn't illegal in crypto as far as I know.
But to be honest, it wasn't hard to predict that CB was going to start selling bcash. Why else make the infrastructure to have their customers recieve bcash if they can't trade it?
Hell, I was under the impression (because I forgot) that they were going to start trading bcash, not just make it available to their pre-fork holders.
I'm not saying there wasn't blatant market manipulation at work here. But It was hardly surprising.
There's one thing I learned from the previous pump and dump:
Roger and Jihan have a lot of Bitcoin... and if they want to cash out, it will affect the price, at least in the short term.

We don't need to rush it. That's just what bcash suportters want poeple to believe.
Bcash supporters push their solution as if we lived on a world where everyone uses crypto for everything already.
The truth is, most people don't even know what crypto is yet. So we have time to make layer 2, and even layer 3 solutions.
The current state of wallets tells you a lot about how close we are to bring crytpo to the mainstream audience.
Because wallets are still very hard to use, and it's easy to screw up security and losing funds.
If I had to market a software analogy with other software. I'd say we are in the early "TeamSpeak" or "ventrilo" days. With a full fledged app like "discord" being far away still.

Here's the thing:
Moore's law has been over for a few years now. Just look at how long Intel has been stuck on 14nm, and a look at the prices also reflect the death of Moore's law is already in place.
Miniaturization will continue for some time still, but it will happen at a much slower pace, and the benefits will be lower and lower, to the point where it will no longer make any economic sense to chase a smaller node.
There are many ways in which progress will continue after miniaturization is finally over for silicon. But none of those seem to be enablers of exponential growth.
Information technologies grow exponentially, but this growth has almost everything to do with Moore's law. 
A lot of people don't expect anything below 7 nm to ever come to market, so who knows how we'll continue to scale after 2020-2022. 
And let's say we can magically get to 1 nm, we'd still wouldn't be able to make transistors that are smaller than an atom.
TL;DR.- Unless we can find a substitute technology that scales exponentially, computer processing progress will seem to have come to a complete halt.

Then you have to read up on what Bitcoin is all about.
Miners can threaten all they want about their intentions. But the rules of Bitcoin would make sure they would never mine a chain that isn't Bitcoin (because it wouldn't be as profitable)
The market controls the price, and the miners will always follow the price, they are not that stupid.
They *really* wanted this to happen though. But the market ignored their takeover attempt and the bluff was called with no effort.
The moral of the story is:
Don't be an idiot and bet against Bitcoin!

Then it's important you keep your eyes on the ball.

And hopefully, if we do see on chain scaling, it will be for better reasons than just making the chain more bloated.

@_date: 2017-11-23 05:24:12
I disagree.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Bitcoin, the LN, and whatever other protocol layers come later will eventually enable mass adoption.
There is going to come a point where to do anything useful on the internet, you're going to *need* crypto. Because any other medium of exchange will not be suited for the next generation of applications.
This is when we'll start seeing a mass exodus from fiat to crypto (which will bring the price of Bitcoin per dollar up... but since dollars won't be worth nearly as much by then, Bitcoin won't go up in value as much as the USD/BTC ratio would suggest)
So the govts. and banks will have to scramble to stay relevant.
They could ban crypto, and try to run the economy like they always have. But that would result in people finding ways in trading fiat for crypto anyway, since crypto will be the only currency that works well on those new internet applications.
So they could go to plan B, and make dollars tokenized. Which would seem like a good idea at first, since now that money would have the same properties as other crypto.
But, that would result in the dollar having to compete with Bitcoin and others in an even playing field. Since now trading it would be frictionless against other crypto.
That would result in a much faster exodus from USD to Bitcoin.
So I think that anyway we look at it, fiat is fucked in the end.
And if you think we 're seeing mass adoption right now, I'll just say:
You haven't seen nothing yet. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth our planet has ever seen.

Don't worry about pushing those companies to adopt it. We don't need them to.
Eventually, developers of actual Bitcoin applications, will have no choice but to adopt second, third, and who knows how many more layers of the protocol we call Bitcoin to make compelling financial applications.
The innovation in this space isn't going to come from the exchanges, they are just a necessary tool for people to get into this space at the moment.
When Bitcoin goes mainstream, It will be buried so deep in the layer stack, that most people won't even realize they are using it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:13:49
I agree that buying equals amounts of coins is buying into the FUD...
With that said. It's not something completely unreasonable.
Jihan and Ver did show one thing the day they pumped bcash on bithumb:
They have a lot of Bitcoin... a lot. It's not unreasonable to think they won't try to pump it again. But the problem of buying into the FUD, is that usually they'll be the first out the door, leaving everyone that followed holding the bags.
But again, if they do pump BCH again, which I believe they might. It wouldn't be *unreasonable* to hold a little bit of BCH that you can hopefully dump back on the market *before* they get out.

Yep, when BTC goes down, everything goes down with it, but harder. Because the market cap is much lower on alt coins.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:50:17
It's worse, the guy bet against Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:35:20
Yes, it's an attack. But think about it. If BTC can't survive such attacks, then it would be a failed experiment.
It's good that the network has to prove itself now, instead of later, when there is even more at stake (not to say it won't be attacked in the future, but at least this way it will be more resilient)
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:52:06
This is why you shouldn't have your coins in an exchange.
By your reasoning, they would be obligated to support any random contentious hard forks that come along. Or any forks.
Should they also add support for Bitcoin bronze plus, or Bitcoin Mars?
Anyone can fork Bitcoin, but they only trade Bitcoin, and didn't claim otherwise.

I guess everyone has their own reasons why to invest in something. Yours is pretty fucking dumb.
But fear not, mine is dumb too (at least short term) I could be making a killing right now riding the Bcash pump.
But I just can't bring myself to invest a single cent in what I consider to be a far worse project, for many reasons.
The biggest deal breaker for me, is not even the deceptive marketing tactics, or the brand stealing.
For me, It's the complete lack of vision by it's supporters. Bitcoin having high fees would be a horrible problem to have if everyone in the world was using it. (if it was mainstream)
But it's not, is it? we're a very long way from having *any* coin being there. So in the meantime, the devs should do what they are doing, and work on scaling on top of Bitcoin.
By the time we need cheap transactions, because everyone is using Bitccoin. Bitcoin will have scaled way beyond what any current payment system can do. And a lot of it will have to do with doing the right thing, right now. 
Instead of being forced into hard forks because of peer pressure.

Yep, and what's worse: All of the "promising" successors to moore's law aren't exponential enablers. (one trick ponies)
The only thing I can think off to keep the exponential train going is if A.I. could somehow shorten the time scale of the breakthroughs needed to keep the bandwagon chugging along.

So in other words, it's probably never going to happen for Bitcoin.
And he also isn't convinced anymore that the LN will help privacy that much, if he is now saying that it needs to be done at the base layer.

Come on now, most of the alt coins are very scammy, even some of the interesting projects like ETH, Zcash are not as obvious a scam as bitconnect, but 20% mining fee on zcash is scammy as hell, as is the ETH presale.

Yeah, just like when it went from 32 bucks all the way down to 2 dollars... it never recovered from that.

It is, because Bitcoin is not run by miners, it's run by nodes.

I think blood is a massive understatement. This is more like brains and guts on the street. At least when it comes to the whole crypto market, not just BTC.

OK, wrap your mind around this:
What will happen, when sending money is as easy as clicking on a snapchat/whatsapp/etc contact and instead of sending a dog picture, you send them bitcoin? (interestingly, you could send them bitcoin in a picture of a dog, and no one is looking to censor dog pictures, and if they are.. Bitcoin is the least of your worries!)
Bitcoin is to internet money, what TCP/IP is to the internet itself.
Do most people even know they use TCP/IP daily? I'm sure they don't, and it doesn't really matter, does it? the internet still works, and everyone uses it.
Right now Bitcoin has the equivalent interface to MS-DOS, and when it gets implemented to user friendly interfaces like smart wallets and social media apps, It will change everything, just like the internet has.
Bitcoin is revolutionary technology, because it allows anyone to transact with anyone, at any place or time, with out using any sort of third party. Now we just need to build the interface and infrastructure for it.
Of course, by the time sending Bitcoin is as easy as just clicking on your contact and clicking "send" Bitcoin will probably be worth a few orders of magnitude more than it does today.
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:01:41
I think you should've named it PayBull.
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:45:46
It is a big deal. No other blockchain has been worth as much as BTC does today. Which is why people are now showing their true colors and are doing the first coordinating attack on Bitcoin in this scale (and making it seem, that because it's coordinated, it makes it A-OK!)
Do you really believe that LTC wouldn't be the one under attack if so much was at stake?
If the users make another chain more profitable than BTC, that would be the chain under attack. 
This is something that had not happened because BTC just wasn't big enough yet, but now that it's gotten this big, it's going to be constantly under attack. This is the first of many to come.
Of course those other blockchains don't have this problem, they're not as relevant yet.
It's time to see just how resilient BTC is when it's under attack, hopefully a lot will be learned from this and other blockchains prepare for it. Because if those get big enough, similar drama will unfold.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:18:34
You're assuming it's over though, we could very well set 6k or higher as the new standard.
Remember when we hit 3k? That didn't last very long.

@_date: 2017-10-04 15:56:29
best of luck to you bud. I wouldn't think of picking up BCH at current prices, maybe at 200 -250 I'd consider it.
Bitcoin itself is seeing very low volume, and BCH volume is dead by comparison, and the miners just aren't there. (I think somewhere in this sub someone says that it's taking about 6 hours for transactions to complete)

Segwit, bigblocks, LN. Do not fix the scaling issue. So he's right.
There is enough users out there to bring any blockchain to it's knees, the scaling problem won't be solved any time soon.
Just go back in time 2 years in BTC, and everything was just fine.
But now that the game got real, the attacks on Bitcoin, or any chain big enough will get very serious too.
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:45:41
20%? What wallet are you using?
I moved 150 dollars from one wallet to another and the fee was less than 11 cents.

A 1MB blocksize increase is a shitty excuse for a hard fork.
Hardforks are a very big deal, and are the way to go when you're making significant upgrades to the protocol.
But doing a hard for for this reason is very reckless with so much at stake, the reasons behind this can't be as simple as "really, they just want bigger blocks!" (there's already bitcoin cash for that)

Who cares about the number of institutions? Some of which are banks (lol, exchanges)
The whole point of Bitcoin is that it doesn't need any of them. 
very soon, even exchanges will be replaced as a means to get Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:45:31
Actually, the miners can leave if they want, nodes will simply reject the new chain.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:59:24
Except more than 80% of the hash rate was on the side of ethereum developers. Which makes this extremely different.
Make no mistake, this is an attack on Bitcoin. This is a highly contentious fork.
There is too much at stake, so power grabs and attacks are to be expected. We will see how the protocol deals with this attack soon enough.
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:16:04
why compromise with miners though?
They already get paid a lot, and now we should also give them control over the project?

They'd be fine. But the "CEO" of Bitcoin Cash is trying to make people believe that their coin is actually the true Bitcoin (they are basically trying to get rid of the "cash" name, confusing newcomers)
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:51:17
The answer is, who gives a shit.
Wallets like these, and exchanges are basically trying to become the second and third layers of Bitcoin as companies.
We need wallets and exchanges to be built from nothing but protocols in the end.
