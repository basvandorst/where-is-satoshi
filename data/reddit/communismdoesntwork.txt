Overproduction is rare because it is very costly to over produce.
Natural resource are doing fine.

Of course.

These are problems to be solved, not fundamental problems. Bitcoin might not be the solution, but there are many people working on these problems right now.

Now that's a really good point. I haven't thought about it too hard, but off the top of my head, I do know it's possible to set up a smart contracts/DAO with it's own native currency. With this native currency, they could create out of thin air a theoretically infinite amount of tokens. And just like in fractional reserve banking, they can set the limit to some multiple of of how much "real" money(like BTC or ETH) is in the smart contract. So if people invest 100 ETH into the DAO, then the DAO could be programmed to lend out a max of 200 ETH equivalent or whatever. MakerDai does something similar, but they used this technique to create a stable coin that's pegged to USD.


True, but the principle is there. I'm still optimistic that someone can come up with a solution

Capitalism is the best economic system period.

But decentralized technologies like cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will make it more efficient, and give capital-seekers more capital to pull from. Think crowd funding but with decentralized smart contracts. ICOs are a decent example, but it's yet to be seen if that model is sustainable.

And when the losing side dies and can't pay back their loans? This stupid conspiracy doesn't even make sense on paper.

Crypto is secure and counterproof.

Because one is dictating, and the other has no choice. The difference is power vs no power.

You've got it backwards. The value of a dollar went from 6.19 to 1. The value decreased.

Allocating capital to the best projects can be done with DAOs and other forms of crowd sourcing

But? Earning profits is a great thing, because it means you've helped people with their problems. 
And we don't hate corporations, we hate central banks.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:23:11
No, central banks are the government

It absolutely does not lol. The dead state just defaults by default.

Is that a serious question? Why are you even here?

There aren't any modern examples because there haven't been any opportunities. Venezuelans have the most to gain from an armed uprising right now, but their government took away their guns. Now they're stuck with a brutal marxist dictator, as they slowly starve to death. 
And you can't fight tyranny with a lawyer. Tyrants done respect the law. They either become blatant dictators in which they determine what they law is unilaterally, or they rig elections to do it subtly. Either way, your lawyer isn't going to do shit. If lawyers could stop tyrants, Venezuelans and North Koreans wouldn't be suffering so much right now. So let me ask you this, if you had that the chance you arm every able bodied Venezuelan, would you do it? Keep in mind they already tired country-wide protests.


You're also ignoring the fact that guns are used in self defense situations. If someone breaks into your home, how are you planning on stopping them? I the US, there are over a million defensive gun uses every year. Guns put a 70 year old granny on the same equal playing field as gang members in their 20s. Guns are the great equalizer.

Bitcoin is great, but the scalability problem hasn't been solved yet. Keyword: yet.

Governments kill way more than people kill, and the right to bear arms protects us from tyrannical governments.
