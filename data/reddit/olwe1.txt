You forgot the most important : You are working to reimburse the interest who don't belong to banks, which literally makes you a slave because you're working for nothing.

The thing is that once the point of no return has crossed (the point where banks will have no money to withdraw) people will get completely rekt by not having bought btc in the first place.
Bitcoin defeats fiat since 2009. By its highly competiting aspect, it will siphon every other assets. This is just mathematics applied to the actual economic system. Why would you have everything else if btc is by far the strongest asset ?
We are still in the early phase where you can make money but somewhere between 35% 50% of adoption you will lose everything due to the insolvabilty of banks.
Like it or not, IMO it's not a bad idea to buy some now.

Why don't you use a raspberry pi ? It's 50$ and 2-4watts

In 2009 the most advance AI was definitely toasters sooo... nope.

This is why everybody should learn code. It's like voting for a president without any informations but just because he/she looks nice !

Plot twist : ViaBTC is owned by central banks !
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:25:56
Any good BCH wallet ?

It means that people who are using bitcoin increases in an exponential way. Which means that people using fiat decreases in an exponential way.
Central banks doomsday is coming

Actually it's 0.00006%, but yeah it has a really big potential

Most of medias are owned by bankers. What's happening is just a chess party as always.

Nothing, it's just that I am less confident with hardware wallets or even phone and desktop wallets. You have to be online to make transactions and just this is a threat to your coins.

Good idea but now the ledger nano s is 70€. I think I prefer to put 20€ more in this.

What we need is a place where we can buy bitcoin with gold !
@_date: 2016-10-15 17:17:16
That's the point with bitcoin, it's a store of value, you don't have to sell...
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:28:59
What's the point of this thread ? All cryptos have not the same purpose... They are legitimate if they're different from each other. That's why lite coin is hitting new low and that's why monero has hit new high recently. Ethereum is also different from bitcoin it's a smart contract blockchain not a store of value.
Who care if bitcoin is wining, the goal is mass adoption of cryptos and cryptos kicking central banks asses !

Hardfork is the only thing that could kill bitcoin now. In the bitcoin sphere, division is a really bad thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:16:57
This is the main problem of a democracy except that in bitcoin we can make no choice at all and remain functional.
Actually, I think the only dangerous thing in bitcoin security is the manipulation of users.
