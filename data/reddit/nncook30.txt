I talked to them via email and Facebook a couple of weeks ago. They will finance that 25k at 0% interest for 25 months. Even better, though, they will sell you pieces of the car so you can build it yourself at your own pace. They get pretty good bulk pricing on all of the components so you would still come out ahead if you bought parts from them vs building from plans and sourcing it all yourself. For instance, they get the complete suspension setup for $600 whereas the same setup costs over $1500 retail. I asked for a price on just the pre-welded chassis, since I fail at welding aluminum, and they quoted me $1000. I plan to build one this winter, hopefully.

Do you plan to do this on the public internet or hide it like Silk Road? Hell, you could sell it on Silk Road if you wanted.
There are quick and easy ways to get a Bitcoin shopping site up. [Bit-Pay.com]( can get you set up pretty quick. I talked to them when I wanted BTC on my site and they were awesome. I ended up just using mtGox and Bitcoin Wallet mobile apps. I'm a service business and I didn't really need heavy website integration when I'm already face-to-face with customer. They'll process your BTC payments and forward them on to you in USD or BTC. I don't know if they'll handle you unless you're completely legal. 
If the "legit" merchant providers won't help you, then there are easy plugins for most Open Source shopping cart software. Any Linux Host provider will have one-click install of the best free shopping carts. If you can't find them, I can probably dig them up. I know I have one or two on my computer here but I'm not sure if they still work with current versions. I got them from the programmer early last year and didn't use them because I couldn't think of anything to sell that wouldn't get my door kicked in.

Fair enough. I haven't dealt directly with CARB since I usually just ignore them and do what I want anyway. When I first moved there I had a one year old MazdaSpeed Protege and they tried like hell to make me pay sales tax on it even though it was paid off and titled in another state. I know most Cali residents can't do that and it's benefit of only living there part time. I have given up on NGV projects in the past because I didn't want to deal with them.
Still I don't think a common Honda engine will have too much trouble getting an exemption for a rerouted exhaust. I guess that really depends on how much money Cali people would be willing to donate towards getting it approved. It's not like CARB actually cares about anything but the money, anyway.

Yeah, I started mining in Jan, 2009 but I stopped soon after because I wanted to play games more and BTC was only worth a cent or so. I cashed out about 13k bitcoins @ $.98. 
If I had waited 2-3 weeks.....  But I figure it's for the best, I was worried about Gox paying out $10k. I can only imagine if I had asked for $300k.

It's a decentralized DNS system. It puts the .bit TLD in the same realm as bitcoins. All of the strengths and weakness of bitcoin but for domain names. It makes it very hard for a central power to knock websites off the internet by appropriating, redirecting, or dropping domain names from the DNS system. It's a few layers of anonymity. It's not 100% anonymous but it stops governments from getting at site owners by issuing subpoenas, passing laws, or other bureaucratic means.
Namecoin does, however, require that people devote some GPU time to their network. So, it kind of competes with bitcoin.

I sell real goods and I find the best way not to go broke is to charge the current rate and sell the coins on an exchange, right on the spot. Holding for appreciation is cool when you don't have to restock. Not that I have a lot of experience at it.

Accepting bitcoins and being paid in Bitcoins is two different things. We do accept them but haven't made a single sale in BCs yet. We're based in a large city, only have local reach, and we're still very small. 90% of our customers are B2B. The ones that aren't don't concern themselves with internet culture.
This business was funded with BC profits so we're trying to give back and give BC a foothold offline. I'll help in whatever way I can, but at this point I don't think there is much we can offer.

**tl;dr: There are financial statements available. I know they were published or reported on @ Wired.com and referenced by many other blog and news sites. These are the details as I remember them.**
A fully registered and legal German non-profit handles all of the donation money and they have released financial statements as required. Their report puts WL's base expenses at somewhere around $200k per year. This includes hosting/bandwidth and hiring outside journalism and legal experts to process the leaks before publishing. Almost everyone involved is, ususally, an unpaid volunteer. They've stated that it would require about $600k per year to pay all of the volunteers but that has only happened once (this year) due to lack of funds. Assange and one or two others have had their travel and non-personal legal expenses covered but don't generally take a salary. Assange did, however, take close to $90k as back-pay for 2010. WL pledged $50k+ to Bradley Manning's defense and has delivered on $15k of that pledge. Though, the estimated $100k needed for his defense has been raised by other means. WL also paid to send people to Iraq to get first hand accounts from the people on the receiving end of the events depicted in the "Collateral Murder" video.
Since Jan. 2010, WL has taken in a little less than $2million in donations. Over half of it came in via PayPal and Wire with the majority coming from the US. Before 2010 only about $6k total in donations had been taken in. It wasn't until after the last time WL shut down, then released the "Collateral Murder" video that they could even be accused of having too much money.

Yeah, but by the time this goes through, I'll probably have to pull the USD out again. It'll be time to pay out various business expenses. I didn't need the money before and had time to make it back before these bills came due if I lost it. If I can't get it into and out of Bitcoin in the span of a month or so, I'm afraid I really can't afford to put USD into the system.
@_date: 2011-06-25 14:13:21
Because PayPal hates us. They will freeze accounts and keep the money if they find out your transactions are related to Bitcoin. More importantly, PayPal transactions are reversible. If you sell bitcoins to someone, they have 30 days to initiate a charge back. Which means they keep the Bitcoins and the Cash. Because PayPal hates us, they will always let the charge back go through and you have no recourse to get your Bitcoins back. 
[Dwolla]( is a good replacement for PayPal when dealing with Bitcoin. They're slow as fuck about getting transfers through but they are safe and reliable.
@_date: 2011-10-25 13:07:52
Square/Card Case already does all that in the US but the transactions are instant no matter how many banks are in the middle.
For Bitcoin, this is gonna be real simple once Near Field Coms are on most phones. Starting with the Sumsung Google Nexus Prime Galaxy S III 4G, or whatever name they decide on, that drops on Verizon next month and iPhone 5. The mtGox app already does every bit of what this Australian system does except for the NFC. Someone will build an NFC app for BTC at some point in the near future.
You don't have to worry about storing and sharing all of these addresses and account details on a central site. You can use the Gox app or a standalone wallet app and just bump phones to transfer. If you must use facebook to send BTC (I would avoid it like the plague), a wallet app could easily send any relevant information to the contacts that Android and iPhone already autosync with FB. I can already send anything on my phone to a single person 12 different ways and my phone automatically pulls in contacts from 4 different sources. All that matters is that you can acquired some kind of contact info for that person. 
All the pieces are available, they just need to be put together.

No, man. It's still early days. You'd do well to get a decent video card and keep mining. The real trick though, is to find ways to create services and products to sell. Everyone that can do that now will be on par with early miners.
But yeah, it's going to get harder and harder to sit around on your ass and keep pulling in BTC unless you can come up with something that competes with the likes of MtGox or Deepbit.
@_date: 2011-11-21 23:12:22
It may take a little longer on the first transaction. It was something close to 10 days on my first Dwolla to Gox transaction. It could be different now, though.

FWIW, I'll keep watch on your project. Once it looks to me like it will get funded and more details are available, I'll kick in at the $250 level at least. I have a business (brick and mortar type) and I want to accept bitcoins. So far I've just been posting my prices in BC and dealing with educating ppl on their use.
So, what kind of cost are we talking about for vendors to accept the card? Few will pay a monthly fee in the beginning. It may be even be years before I'd make my $250 back.
Will you be developing mobile solutions? A large part of my business involves running cards on web based services from an Android phone or the 4G connected laptop in the service vehicles. I don't use terminals for any CC.

Ok. I'll try again. Hell, I know it's confusing. I learn a little more every time I try to explain it and I'm probably missing something that would make it easy to understand.
You're mining coins that can be spent on DNS services. Each coin you generate contains a domain name, where it points to, which account owns it, etc.
While you're mining for coins, you're also processing transactions for everyone else that uses .bit domain names. When some one buys a new .bit domain name with a namecoin, the rest of the network confirms that he has paid the correct amount and transfers ownership to that person. Every time a change is made, ownership, renewal, or server change, people processing transactions on the Namecoin network are paid to confirm those changes.
Everyone, collectively, does everything Netwoksolutions.com or GoDaddy does when you buy a domain name from them. Except the middle man is gone. All the records that control which server a domain name sends you to is stored in the block chain which is on everyone's computer.

I understand the volatility issues. I'm not too very concerned since I will have to pull BTC out to USD on a fairly regular basis since my service also requires that I keep supplies of other volatile commodities that I can't get with BTC. I could potentially lose on both sides but that's fine. As long as I don't go I broke, my intention is just to provided a needed service and keep BTC growing. I started this business with BTC in the first place. I have to give back somehow.

Well, you know. I didn't want to mislead. I imagine namecoin could face some of the issues bitcoin does. Like data mining for user info and block chain take over. Or have they dealt with those issues and I'm just ignorant?

That's reasonable at the moment. I'm paying 2.75% to accept the four major credit cards anyway.

Oh, thats awesome. I just installed it it for the first time last week and  had no idea.

The chain is transparent to you. All you know is you got money and shipped the monitor out. The other guy gets the monitor and just has to pay his brother or close friend for it at some point in the future.

Now if I can get them to send me some phone verification emails. I'm sick of dealing with gox and I've been out of the game for a while. Come on Coinbase. Let me in.

Sounds good. I have a couple of places to add. I just haven't put them out there because I'm having kids and haven't really had time to do any business, lol.

There's too many things in the Misc. category.

I've accepted BTC since the early days but have yet to conduct a transaction in BTC. It's a local B&amp;M, though. I'll be starting a new delivery business in few weeks that will also ship to where ever so maybe more people will be willing.
