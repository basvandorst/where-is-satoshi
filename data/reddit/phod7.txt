Obviously its not the protocols fault, and I realize that coinbase can not be held accountable for my mistake of deleting the wallet. The issue that I have with coinbase is that they don't allow you the same level of control of your funds that is inherent in any other bitcoin wallet. I was unable to see where my funds were through the blockchain like I could have with any other service, and because of that I made a mistake that cost me money.
edit: forgot a word
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:02:03
There is definite risk with holding bitcoin as far as their value is concerned, but the risk of mishandled transactions is negligent in the protocol and I was simply using bitcoin as a means of transaction. I actually save more money as I get 3% back when I use bitcoin and gyft which negates the small coinbase fee. I prefer to do this instead of a rewards credit card partly because I dislike using credit cards often, and I also truly appreciate how Gyft works as a company and I like to support them with my business.
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:22:31
Why would I not assume the issue had been resolved though? The transaction was deleted and the money was "safely" in my coinbase wallet which I was then able to send to another address with no issue until this morning. As far as I was concerned the issue with the first transaction was done since I still had the BTC to use, or so I thought.
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:47:14
Yup that lesson would have saved me from losing funds. But hopefully others will also learn the lesson that coinbase handles transactions in a bit of a different manner than is found for most every other bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:41:09
I wasn't expecting to take on any risk by putting it in bitcoin. I wasn't trying to speculate on the price, I was purchasing bitcoin and then going to transfer it into gyft to be able to spend off amazon and at my grocery store. Coinbase has never given me an issue like this in the past and I've never thought that funds listed in my account actually weren't there to spend. Losing the funds was obviously my fault, but the transaction processing was very flawed which is why I wanted to share this experience as it is important to note for any other users.
@_date: 2014-01-17 09:04:33
With this I can instantly receive the BTC to use?
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:36:33
Yes but the way coinbase is structured is that as soon as you make and approve the transaction, your account balance is reduced so that you can't double spend the money. I wasn't concerned about having an issue with my second transaction since the BTC had been returned to my account after previously being removed when I made the first transaction. If I see a balance in a BTC wallet, I have always assumed that the funds are there which has been right in every case but this one. I assumed that since the transaction was cancelled and the funds were returned that it was safe to assume that the transaction would not be sent again, at least without my permission. Coinbase should have a warning that the balance listed may not be correct if that is the case.

He signs off to commercial with "Baby steps, Bitcoin people!"
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:28:16
Me deleting my wallet obviously isn't their fault, but the way they handle their transaction processing and reporting is very flawed if you ask me. Using bitcoin, I should have no issues trying to figure out where my funds are at any one time through a publicly verifiable source. I had that issue with coinbase which is why my opinion of them is changing.
@_date: 2014-01-17 09:03:46
The limit is 1 btc/week for instant, that is pretty easy to do. I'm trying to buy 1.5 BTC right now and its not gunna happen...
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:56:39
I see what you are saying. If thats the case, then any funds returned should be disclaimed with a warning that they still may go through shouldn't they? My favorite thing about bitcoin is the complete transparency it provides with handling your funds. Coinbase doesn't seem to provide this and its a bit frustrating to me. I assume that a customer service rep was the one who fixed the transactions as nothing happened until a minute or so after I saw a rep was assigned to my problem. In that case a simple message from them with a warning about the issue would have sufficed in stopping this situation from happening.
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:44:11
It generally is actaully, but I hate having a ton of empty wallets I'm not going to use in my mobile app so I periodically clear them out anyways to satiate my OCD. I just had bad timing and no foresight when I did it last night.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:05:57
He's talking about Mt. Gox and painting it as "brazen fraud". He trashes the big banks throughout as well.
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:50:55
I saw no harm in deleting what I thought was an unused key, and yup I was wrong. I definitely facepalmed in real life once it occured to me where my funds were this morning...
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:17:27
Well I kinda find the insinuation insulting, but I think you meant it in good nature so its fine. 
I haven't taken money from my parents since I left HS and went to college 6 years ago, which is partly why my student loans are so high. This has more impact on me than you may think though. I realize its a small amount of money relatively, but I try to manage my money very tightly since I work hard and have a lot of bills to pay. Missing a rent or loan payment is not something I want to do as it has consequences, and not having the money from the transaction has a larger effect than just losing a couple of dollars when money is tight and you are on a strict budget. This purchase was supposed to go towards buying both groceries for the next two months and for a gift I was going to buy today, and I had money specifically set aside to do this which is now gone. 
I guess I was being dramatic in my wording so I will edit my post to make it more accurate, but please try to understand that money issues are relative to the financial position you are in...
@_date: 2014-01-17 14:50:00
Ah ok I just edited my post to mention that thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:41:14
I plan on this presentation mostly serving the purpose of getting everyone in the room on the same level knowledge about bitcoin, as there will be people from many different areas of bank operations who may know more or less about certain areas. I think making the transaction will be the biggest way to drive home the true utility of bitcoin! Do you have a link to the coinbase transaction by any chance? I'd love to show that as well.
And I love the idea about talking briefly about the past, I had skipped over that but I will try to add it to the last section as a basis for adoption in the future maybe.
edit: a word
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:41:30
Interesting, I'll check them out in the morning thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:55:25
Yeah I'm really lost here
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:49:37
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:03:09
Yes they ended up both giving me their cards and I have spoken to them both through email and phone multiple times since it happend.
I don't want to get too specific as I feel that would be a breach of confidentiality (This is a very public forum after all), but one is a Senior VP at a bank and the other is a director at a firm that handles Mergers and Acquisitions and private equity.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:49:22
That will be stressed as I talk, didn't really want to have to clutter up the presentation with that explaination. I will add something in about the 3 party, though I think you are referring to "escrow" not "arbitrage". Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:32:39
Hey sorry it's been a busy night. I have went in today at 3 and gave my presentation to about 12 people. I got great feedback from multiple people there and was able to answer any questions they had. There were a few things discussed as options for a bank to have a service that catered to BTC users that kinda surprised me, but would be amazing if it came to fruition (Think instant ach transfers to an exchange). It was a fantastic experience to be able to speak in front of a great crowd with many good questions.
Many of the people there had minimal knowledge about Bitcoin beyond a few headlines and I was told that I handled the difficult subject of explaining it's mechanics very well to them. We ended up discussing bitcoin for about an hour more than planned which was a good sign I think. 
I wasn't offered a job, but I was told that I shouldn't be surprised if I get asked back to talk some more which is great for me. All in all it was an amazing experience being able to educate a room full of bankers and get them excited about the possibilities of BTC. I can answer any questions you guys have about what exactly they wanted to know more about, ect. just ask!!
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:01:34
This sounds like a fantastic idea and hadn't even occurred to me. I will contact them tomorrow morning!
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:48:02
I can't say I'm feeling any pressure yet, but it'll come later I'm sure. I get about an hour to speak, but maybe more if there are a lot of questions. I thinks its gunna be hard to stay on track like you said. Hopefully I can organize this well enough to where any potential questions will be answered quickly after they would potentially be asked. I appreciate the encouragement though, I have to say I'm excited!
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:21:58
And I'll add more to the last section just hadn't had time yet. I put basic stuff in as a placeholder for now 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:03:20
Yes I was thinking of using something like the 3 year chart with a log scale. This shows steady growth with a seemingly normal amount of variance. Any time periods in particular I should highlight?
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:44:20
Right now it hasn't been discussed and I'd be more than happy to do it pro bono. 
Like I said in the title I'm a bartender now among other things, but I studied Finance and Economics in college and have been doing investing on the side for 5ish years now. I am fairly knowledgeable on the subject of bitcoin, but no expert. Being able to talk about it in financial terms and how there were potential market opportunities and threats opened their eyes and really had them enthralled with the conversation. It seemed they had only understood it through the random headlines that pop up on the news.
Should I even ask for payment? I'm 24 and have no professional experience to list in the banking field outside of my college education. They were the ones who insisted on giving me their cards and said that they would have to take me out to lunch to talk some more, though. 
Like I said I'm thrilled just to get to do this so I will gladly do it for free! I do however still work full time with long hours so it would be nice to get some payment for this as I plan on spending a considerable amount of time doing additional research and preparing :/
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:26:56
Not everyone is out to get you. If you could switch to a smaller bank that was in some way Bitcoin friendly and had better fees than BoA wouldn't you at least consider it? I think besides the money they could make through a service directly linked to BTC in some way, there is an even bigger opportunity to attract a customer base that they didn't have before. This can be especially important for banks on the medium to small scale.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:55:28
Can you elaborate on this?
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:32:45
This is where I'm going to put emphasis on for a little. As a bank they have more direct effect on the fiat side and may have some perspective on this. I will be able to ask them questions too and this may be something I try to start a discussion on. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:16:20
Hmm hadn't thought about that aspect of gift cards. 
I'm not sure how to approach mining here... I don't want to waste too much time on it as it can get confusing and I don't think this is where they want to focus. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:06:24
Yup I agree. I think there are some great connections here I could build off of and at least it is a solid experience and reference I can use in the future. Good advice!
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:49:35
Not the first person to say this. I need to look at that page again but I'll mess with it. And some color will be added tomorrow, but not too much I like a simpler style.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:52:36
I see where you are coming from, but they would know that I don't have a standard rate and would likely see through that. I'm not trying to get as much profit as I can for this. I think cultivating the relationships with the two men I met and any one who will possibly attend would be more beneficial.
I would rather do my best for free with the hope of it being valuable for me in the future. I figure the worst case scenario is that I am still working at the same place and got a cool experience, right?
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:44:08
I agree. Thanks for the sage advice!
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:54:56
This is more along the lines of what I was thinking. No chance of failure doing this right?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:04:40
I will probably run a bit longer than 15 mins but we'll see. I was told I'd have about an hour total for talking, questions, and discussion.
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:26:54
maybe not the best wording, its removed for now
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:50:29
I'll be on my laptop for a few examples after the presentation is done and I will bring this up then I think. Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:50:15
Yeah I'll fix that tomorrow good eye!
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:04:59
And I will definitely report back to reddit haha
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:47:59
I asked the one guy who directly works for a bank what their opinions were on it and he said that they "were scared of it" so... MYTH CONFIRMED?
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:50:41
Go Hokies haha!
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:18:38
And should I do it now or when I finish my first draft of my presentation so I have something to show for it?
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:13:25
You would be surprised the number of banks in the US. There are definitely plenty of "small" banks with 10+ branches too.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:56:03
No way this is true, maybe you are just reading it wrong? I have bought many amazon gift cards through gift and paid the current exchange rate and instantly got my gift card with 0 fees. So $ 100 worth of BTC bought me a $100 gift card. I even got points for past purchases I had made automatically once they came out with rewards last week. I love Gyft it gives me a great way to spend BTC without converting to fiat first!
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:41:15
If it is I'm in haha. How would I go about finding companies to present to? Just start calling people?
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:46:58
This is awesome. Cool way to look at the growth!
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:01:35
This is a cool way to illustrate volatile growth. Where did you learn how to do this?
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:31:49
Just posted it from mobile let me see if I can link. I will update tonight sorry!
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:20:02
Hey this is because of the way the way the presentation zooms in as I talk about each subject. If the text is small it's because it's not supposed to be read yet.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:52:16
I have updated the presentation again. I added a lot that wasn't there before and changed the color scheme a bit. I also added a QR code on the last slide that I will use at the end to send BTC to from my mobile app and then confirm the transaction on blockchain.info. Any last minute comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I give the presentation at 3pm tomorrow. Once again thanks to everyone who helped so far!
Its the same link as above, the presentation is just updated now
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:13:46
Good advice thanks. I am already doing all the reading and research I possibly can (I actually love research haha) and they have provided me with some general questions they want answered. There was brief mention of the limited amount of BTC's in the future so I should probably address that.
I'm not sure if I should even address altcoins? I will only have an hour to talk and then do a Q &amp; A session after and I don't want to waste unnecessary time and introduce more confusion in what can already be a confusing topic for someone who is new to cryptocurrencies.
I'm trying to be as conservative and analytic as possible, as I am sure they will be offput by large boasting claims and will easily see through anything that is not supported by data.
How would you answer "What is Bitcoin?" in the simplest way possible?
I tried explaining it to my girlfriend last night after I told her about this and it was difficult to explain from someone who has no clue what it is or even how currencies work really (She's a very smart girl and talented graphic designer, just not really into finance!). 
Thanks for the pointers!
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:56:37
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:33:57
I was going to do this but using my own android phone. I think these people would be weary of me taking there phones and installing something on them as they likely will be company phones and would represent a security risk.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:40:34
Yup it was a visa gift card. The best part is that one of the other guys said "We could have just paid him in BTC I guess". I think that about summed up the entire presentation.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:45:08
Oh and I saw the story and plan on trying to use it already thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:11:11
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:33:38
Oh thanks I'll look over this now!
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:25:27
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:42:46
Never knew that! I would say its probably out of the realm of what I'm trying to briefly cover though.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:33:42
Its gone? It says I can still buy instantly?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:14:05
I was given a $100 gift card which I thought was a nice gesture. I figure the hours I put into this can be translated into getting work experience on my resume, so an acceptable trade-off for me. Plus I now have a specific marketable job skill that few people have with multiple solid references to back it up. Worth the time spent busting my ass on this to me!
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:52:15
I'll play around with it in the morning and see. Check back in tomorrow night after I make some changes and let me know what you think of it please.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:34:19
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:00:17
Not a mogul or expert. I think I just had the perfect mix of financial knowledge and experience with bitcoin to speak about it on their level. One guy (The one who does MnA) told me he had never thought of the application for merchants before I put it in the terms I did and thought it was quite interesting. I've always loved finance but never found a job in the field I could see myself doing, so I kept studying past college basically as a hobby. Bartending is just a way to pay the rent each month while I figure out what I want to do with my life haha.
@_date: 2013-10-25 04:01:20
I saw it the other day moving a couple grand at a time and then this popped up again today
@_date: 2013-10-25 04:01:54
AM shares?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:13:13
Ok then how much do I ask for? As of right now other than the 45 mins we talked, they don't really have any references on me. I don't feel it would bother them that I ask for payment though. I'll be spending considerable time on this regardless.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:50:32
I'm on it in the morning thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:33:34
One of the biggest things they kept asking was how the everyday user reacts to the volatility of the value of their BTC. They want to know if that will be hard for an average person to deal with.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:24:10
I never thought about this being an issue. I will declare all the money I've earned off the transactions and pay taxes on it so I don't really see an issue? I didn't think this would be illegal would it?
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:47:50
I will be qualifying most the issues you brought up as I speak to address what you are talking about. I would argue that BTC is highly liquid in theory and the lack of liquidity in practice comes from the $ side of transactions. 
I do like the term "pseudonymity" though I will change that out tomorrow thanks! Follow up questions will definitely be asked, these people aren't leaving without getting my contact info haha :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:34:24
No video sorry. You can click the link in the previous thread to see the finished presentation that I started with today though!
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:07:00
I may use that as inspiration, but I never liked the idea of showing a video to a group of people that is trying to explain what I am presenting on. Seems like I should explain it if I'm talking, not someone else in a video ya know?
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:55:36
Ok I have just contacted the Bitcoin Foundation. I will let you know if they are able to help me.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:35:57
Thanks! Every one I spoke with today was incredibly nice and not what you envision as a typical banker. The guy who gave me the hardest time was an IT guy who is concerned with security. He was still quite nice and joked around with me after I finished.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:33:41
Just added it. Im on mobile sorry!
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:39:37
The best outcome would be to find a way to make money off my knowledge and interest in emerging digital currency. I'm not sure if I'd like a job they would offer me in the commercial banking sector though, but that's a hurdle to cross over if it comes up really. I agree that asking for money will come off as desperate. If they want to pay me great, if not I still get cool experience that most people won't get.
I will be dressing in a shirt, tie, blazer, and kahkis with semi-formal shoes so nothing too casual, but not too formal. I've dressed for many business events before and if they didn't specify I would say I should be fine. My goal is to be professional about the whole presentation as I think that is what will speak to them best. I'm sure the Silk Road will come up again, thats a great way to label it.
The risk aspect will come into it too I'm sure. One of the questions I was asked a lot when we first met was how the everyday consumer would react to the change in value of their currency everyday, and what steps do people take now to avoid this? I have my name on the first slide with some qualifications, but I will add my email on the last slide. I would love a follow up opportunity with a few different people attending.
This was very wise advice, I appreciate you taking the time to write this out!
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:08:31
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:17:45
I plan on updating with my first draft of the presentation when it's done this week to get feedback/criticism from reddit. I'll also tell you guys how it goes after I present for real of course!
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:30:59
I like that method of starting the conversation! Maybe it would be a good way for me to start the discussion on how it can be used or what it is. I could then narrow it down to BTC at the end.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:32:52
Very good to know. I'm sure I haven't broken any laws yet but I will need to review this before I decide to make another transaction through localbitcoins. I am in the US if that helps. I was under the impression that since I was just selling Bitcoins as an investment asset and not a currency it would not fall under this jurisdiction and I would only be concerned with paying taxes on any gains. I am certainly not a lawyer though haha. Any idea what would be the best method to find out if I am doing anything against the law or not?
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:34:39
I'm going to use graphs of historic prices at different scale and time periods to try and illustrate this point and argue against some volatility fears I think. Anything useful you think I should use?
edit: forgot my question
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:34:37
OK I'm changing it around today so check back in tonight and let me know if you like it better please!
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:10:42
Yeah not a bad thing to have as work experience right?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:08:24
I don't feel used and I don't think they are trying to use me. It was beneficial for both of us to have me come speak. Some people spend months at an unpaid internship and do nothing but get coffee, ect. This was a way for me to make a tangible impact on people who could help me find work if needed, and it sets me apart from almost anyone else in the industry right now. That is valuable enough for me!
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:54:30
I have the chance to make handouts as well. I was thinking of listing some resources they would find handy. Perhaps I could give out a paper wallet QR code on it and incorporate that into my presentation.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:55:30
Tell us this earlier then so we get a heads up haha!
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:02:33
Worth noting that I was a finance and economics major so I'm very familiar with financial systems. Still a great moment to remember none the less.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:56:49
I like the concept but I don't think these guys will care about getting the BTC or any gift that I could give them. I want to maintain the image of bitcoin as a serious and viable payment option and want to avoid the gimmicky aspects of it. I would say demo's like these work amazingly well for inspiring the average consumer to adopt BTC though. I think the bank guys would just want to see how it actually transfers and stores value in the most literal ways. I just have to figure out a foolproof way to do that haha :)
edit: added some stuff
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:14:30
I believe there is an exemption for transactions valued under $200. Or maybe that was just if it get classified as a currency not an investment asset. My tax law knowledge is lacking in some areas haha.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:29:21
shorted how?
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:53:18
Whats 3) about? I'll talk about the other two.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:05:03
I was given a $100 gift card at the end which was nice. Think about it from their viewpoint though: other than a brief conversation with me for 45 mins, they had no idea if I would be able to give a coherent speech or be professional in any way. The way I see it is that it was a fairly big risk to have me speak for an hour in front of this crowd so I'm appreciative just for the opportunity. If they want more work from me I'll be able to ask for money as I now how some solid footing to do so.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:23:40
You have to go through security to get to the building, so this would probably be more hassle in coordination than it is worth. Cool idea, but maybe a little gimmicky for me.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:40:28
Ok I'll add some more. I think the last section is where I need to work on tomorrow before I practice some more.

Well we do private parties where I work and this was a group of 30 or so people in a small room. Three guys were making small talk in front of my bar when one says "Hey you guys heard of this crazy bitcoin thing?". Apparently I snickered a bit and after a minute or so of talking one guy asked me if I had ever heard of it since I was a younger guy. 
It obviously went on from there, with a couple people joining the conversation and many questions being asked of me. I did a pretty good job of talking I think, since they started making notes on the back of business cards they had received earlier from other people after a while. One guy was even texting his friends from a much larger bank as we were speaking to see if they had heard of some of the things I was talking about. 
It was a fun time and by the end they both had asked for my cell number and had given me their business cards with their personal cell numbers on the back in case I had any issues contacting them. I don't really know what exactly they would want from me past this talk, but their interest in me seemed very genuine. Either way I want to jump on this opportunity and make a hell of an impression when I meet anyone else attending.
Travel is only 30-45 mins each way. Seems like a bother to ask for gas money from them right?

Will do thanks

Wasn't really mentioned so not sure. Definitely not in the short run. I was told that I shouldn't be surprised if I get asked to come back and talk again which is a good start I think. I also have some other possible people I can give a similar presentation to so maybe that is a route to go?

What effect is this going to have on the market when we see it go back up?
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:47:22
Wow good stuff here. If you have any sites I should look at, share them please! I'll be updating my presentation in the morning and I'll add some of this stuff so check back in tomorrow night.

Yeah the BTC atm I would like to at least briefly go over since one of the VPs is in charge of ATM operations I believe. I know nothing specific about them other than seeing headlines about them being put in at different places. Where should I look for more info on them?
And what other cheap items other than pizza could I buy quickly?

Posted a reply here in the comments that briefly says how it went. Gotta say it was really fun to present to this group!

This may be a dumb question, but... why?
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:39:00
This is where my mind was originally. If I can show them I do great work perhaps they can find a job for me within their company or through a contact? I wasn't thrilled with the entry level jobs for finance majors out of college, which is mostly why I bartend and invest now as a means to a living, but if I could work in something bitcoin related I think that would be worth wearing a suit for haha. Good advice man.

No sorry a little further south down the east coast

I will add that it doesn't mean they will see it as I do, but that is one of my goals for this presentation so hopefully by the end they will!
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:56:17
Challenge accepted haha!

What is an appropriate fee to request then? I also have to drive ~30 mins to get there if that would matter. Would it be too cheeky to ask for payment in Bitcoin :)

These aren't really fat cats. They are from a smaller, more local bank than say BoA or Wells Fargo.
