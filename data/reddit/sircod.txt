Added it to the stocks tracker in Google Now on my phone (had to search for "currency:btc").

With the power limits of USB (.5A * 5V = **2.5W**) it won't be using much power at all. I imagine a graphics card that gets 300 Mhash/s could consume 100W or more.

Market isn't quite as good now, but a few weeks ago you could get 2-3 times your worth of bitcoins in Steam wallet funds by going through some hoops.
* First step is using [TF2WHX]( to buy TF2WH credits using bitcoins.
* Second you use your credits on the [TF2WH]( to buy keys.
* Then you take your keys and sell them on the [Steam Community Market](
Doing some quick math you could use this method now to get Steam wallet funds at an effective rate of about $100/BTC. This is assuming trading at 1400 µBTC/kWHC on TF2WHX and selling keys for $2.30 ($2 after market fees).

You could also try buying keys for about $1.40 via BTC direct from some guy on the SourceOP forums and then sell the keys on the market. But then you have to trust some random guy on the internet or use a trusted middle man.

¢ is to c what ₥ is to m.
As he explained, we don't use centidollars as it is rather cumbersome to say and just saying cents makes things easier. With bitcoins this is an even bigger problem since a bitcoin is worth so much more than a dollar, we could really use a convenient smaller denomination. Writing mBTC isn't terribly difficult, but when talking about bitcoins having to say millibitcoins all the time gets annoying.

Although dollar futures (the [U.S. Dollar Index]( aren't USD/USD but rather USD compared to various other currencies, mostly the Euro. And it started at 100, so we arent't talking about an 80x increase, but rather 80% of what is was 40 years ago.
