Explain to me how you think the equity market is safe with so much world debt, lowering interest rates and quantitative easing?

I loved the part where Schiff said, “I’m kicking myself I didn’t get in when it was $10” if he believes bitcoin has absolutely no value at all, why would he say such a thing. Shot yourself in the foot there Schiffy! ��

First things first even if he is wrong obviously he will not eat his own dick it’s a figure of speech. Secondly I would say he has a bit on his plate and obviously it’s not wise for him to expose himself to what he may or may not have. Of course he has bitcoin.

Acts well educated within the space by organising coins into tiers and use of big words, takes all the newbies money and profit. Seems legit ��

Don’t do it, if you don’t hold your coins in a personal wallet. You don’t own them.

Hahah this post made my day. Clearly you have no idea what you’re doing or what you’re even investing in. Go and educate yourself before you jump on reddit and start blowing your trumpet.

If he decided to sell his one million bitcoins and dump the btc market:
1. He would have to sell it for an extremely low price therefore he would be missing out on billions of dollars.
2.  Bitcoin wouldn’t die, we would get cheap bitcoin and then the market would probably rally in a frenzy so fuck him. There’s nothing he can do.
