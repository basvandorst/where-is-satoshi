Hi.. Did you get any reply back from coinbase?

Guys tweet coinbase support / CEO to look into this. I saw in twitter some one had warned coinbase / GDAX about the website like Nov21. They could have taken action but they didnot do anything about it.

Hi even i got hacked today with authy app on.
Here is what i did .. I wanted to log into GDAX. instead of putting URL directly i selected the first link from google search. which has AD(advertising) symbol next to it and i was also using new computer. It went to GDAX first login page. I clicked on login it navigated to coinbase oauth user name and login page. I had not notice the URL was changed and when the url was changed.(URL :  )
 
I enter the username and password. it asked me authy app code i entered the same and it said GDAX is taking longer time to login wait for few minutes. Then i got a page saying you need to authorize the device using your email and to navigate to gmail click here. i was in office meeting could not concentrate more so clicked on here link which directed to some page to enter email and password of gmail. i entered gmail username and pass word and i got a code as well for google entered that as well then it said wait authorizing the device and gave an error message saying GDAX is down try after 24 hours. i concentrated on office meeting and with in 15 mins all my ethereum and bitcoin was transfer from coinbase to gdax . To my bad luck i had linked my debit card user took ethereum worth 5000$ and he transferred everything to some account in GDAX.
All my email related to Coinbase and google authentication was in trash.
I lost total $10252 today.
Called coinbase they blocked my access and they sent an email I explained them the situation. Hope coinbase can find the address and return back my coins.
Called my bank to stop the bank transfer as well. hope i get that money.
Have even filed a complaint for Internet crime in fbi website

Local police just filed a complaint and said they will check and approve and then they will take care.
FBI was online process did not hear anything back from them.
But local police said FBI will take into consideration only if the amount is more then a million.
