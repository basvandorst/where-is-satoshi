Brain just exploded*!*

I feel like the big obvious reason is the China Fake Ban notice. This caused a HUGE sell off, and as the price recovered once the news was clarified the following may have happened.  
* Whales sold too low, so they're driving the price down to pick up again
* Traders saw the sudden spike down as a signal to sell once the price recovered a reasonable amount
* As the current price trend seems like it's going down, it's easier to convince some people to sell.
There's probably many other possibilities, but this dip in price is not a big concern to me. The way I see it, Bitcoin isn't going anywhere and there is a large amount of investment capital churning into Bitcoin products and services. Either we will see this money grow Bitcoin slowly, or a giant spark of positive news will again throw the market in an
 upswing.
I don't know shit though, this is just how I feel.

Wait what, are they going to start needing scans of personal IDs now? (AML/KYC Laws)

Back in september or so, my friend talked about bitcoin and silk road. Didn't even bother because I thought (*at that time*) that it was simply a complicated means to purchase drugs anonymously.  
**I hate being this wrong.**

Well, I've been mining LTC since march and bought in BTC at $118, so I'm in the party too!

The obvious answer is that it takes more time and items purchased at retail devalue once you try to resell.

Where do you guys grab your prices from? (Shows 1144.60CAD right now, GOX is 1064.64UAD right now.) Is the same price provided when people sell you Bitcoin? 
What is the process for buying Bitcoin from you guys? (Are you using bitpay or a simple "pay cad$ and we'll send to your address" type deal?)

Did not want to make a new thread, but how are you guys' experience with VoS? I'm canadian, with TD currently. Do I need an account at BMO to make a deposit to VoS? How good is VoS for wuickly changing your fiat to btc, then transferring funds out?

Wow, absolutely awesome. What a generous person!

Am I supposed to retype the questions I asked, or are you not comfortable disclosing them? 
As a small time trader (*small*), I would like to know what my coin-to-cash options are and how they are operating. What market the values come from, what application you guys use for exchange, and any other relevant news that is allowed to be disclosed.
Great location and website though, I will be checking back from time to time!

Damn! I miss watching you and Alex on Diggnation. I used to watch you guys a ton a few years ago. It's good to hear that you're on the Bitcoin wagon as well!
