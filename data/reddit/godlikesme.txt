Russian here, it probably will get buried. We have "soviet Russia" jokes, just like you guys. It is mostly an (internet) meme though.

Sort of, menu lists two sizes for each sandwich: 30 cm and 15 cm, but when making order you usually don't use centimeters and simply ask for "big" or "small" sandwich.

Tx fee was automatically suggested by the app, 0.1 mBTC ( ~0.1$, ~ 0.5% of total transaction). Lower than Visa/Mastercard fees AFAIK.

A couple days ago I've read a report by some private company on bitcoin(not very interesting and in russian, but here is [the link]( ). Long story short: it is not illegal, it is not "fully legally defined", and you may have trouble with paying taxes. Sort of grey area.
Personally, I would say that legal risk is quite low(especially if you manage to (not) pay taxes somehow). 
As for future policies, the russian government is unpredictable, but I doubt it will ban bitcoin. CEO of Sberbank(government-run bank), German Gref, says that "you can't stop development of virtual currencies", so my guess that in the worst case we will have "china scenario"(legal to buy/sell, but not legal to use instead of roubles)

Why plural? This is a single subway shop(you can find it on  btw).

AFAIK, it is the only one in Russia. 
Also, there is a subway in the USA:

I could spend the same amount of time describing use of my debit card. ;) 
Mycelium is really cool app, and I'd say that anyone, who can figure out how to play angry birds and use android phonebook, can figure out how to use mycelium. True, my grandmother wouldn't be able to pay in bitcoins without assistance, but neither she knows how to use android phones.

I don't know about subways in other countries, but every russian subway I visited had only one cashdesk. So, they could simply wait until transaction with necessary amount of btc gets broadcasted and safely assume it is yours.  
Also, to uniquely identify transaction a merchant may ask to include some message in your btc transaction(e.g. timestamp + cashiers_desk_id), or have multiple adresses per each cashier desk, or maybe even encode cashier disk id in transaction amount(e.g. 1 extra satoshi for desk  2 extra satoshis for desk  etc :) ).
I'm going to visit this subway this weekend, so maybe I'll post about my experience here.
