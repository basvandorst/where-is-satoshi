I am rather worried about people experiencing so much stress over FUD or small volatility. I think bitcoin is worse than smoking.

Thank you very much

Day trading on crypto = losing money, shortening your lifespan :)

So this future people talking about its today? What led to this theory?
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:33:44
Thank you very much
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:27:09
hey I would like to read more about the stuff you are talking about. I know the definitions and reasons behind hedging and etc. But the actions you are mentioning above are far from my knowledge. Could you suggest a keyword to google for me to begin, book would be even better. Thanks in advance. (I just like to learn new stuff)

You sound like a battle-scarred veteran
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:53:30
Thanks. Why do they need price to be low at the expiry?
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:09:05
I meant to ask what led people to believe future contracts will have effect on the bitcoin price.

I have been waiting for APPL to hit 5 dollars for 5 years

I have been just following the bitcoin price since march last year. I just have gut feelings so nothing anyone else can rely on. We’ve been sitting on this 9k level for too long and it seems we are just ready to go down now. I will suggest you tradingviews.com in ideas section there are people who have TAs and graphs on how it might go. Some of it get lot of traction so they might help you. Good luck
PS i mostly trade on sharp swings
@_date: 2018-05-01 08:57:32
Yeah the indicators are not trustworthy on crypto. They are too late on swings and sentiments. I also missed the early april train. And i did not enter until it tested 9k. I am sorry you are at loss. But best thing you could do is to move on. Its annoying but lingering on what could have been just holds you back. Hope market will be kind to you from now on.
