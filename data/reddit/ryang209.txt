I think the loan and interest value should be 'hedged' so that no matter what the financial stability of the bitcoin is you are paying back exactly the amount you borrowed plus the interest you promised. Say for example you got a 1btc loan at 200€ (If your American) and the bubble bursts, if the loan is hedged you will still pay the exact amount you borrowed plus the exact interest agreed upon. Just my theory :)

Thanks bud :) Maybe one day it could be a 'thing'. Then again it could be someone elses great idea. That is the great thing about the future, it is unknown :)

Hopefully one day bitcoins will be added to googles currency converter but in my personal opinion, i don't believe that will happen until a stable 'norm' is established. Just seems to me that a company as big as this won't back it until the currency has leveled out and has a wide potential user base. (wider then we have now anyways) I however believe that it will happen and when it does other exchanges will follow suit with actual exchanges. But for the foreseeable future it is unknown as bitcoins life expectancy is skeptical to many people due to its great price rises and falls. 
Thanks if you decide to read :)

Quick question. Why don't a group of people form together with a large amount of BTC sell them all at 1k and have sell orders for anything from 500-900 surely if they had enough btc they could make a killing and get their coins back?

Well yes, it would be nice to have a stable currency to loan out or get loans from, much like we do with fiat. Its as simple as this i like to think: You give me a loan of 10 btc right now... I plan to repay you the full amount in 6months with 10%. Now if the loan isin't hedged and the bubble bursts, dropping the price back to 10$ a coin, I only have to pay you the original 10btc plus the 1 btc interest, meaning for giving me roughly 2000$ of a loan expecting 2200$ back you would get 110$... But to sum up your question in a nutshell, the stability of a bitcoin means absolutly nothing should services such as loans use hedging as you will get exactly what you gave plus your interest. I know i sound like one of them teachers that explains everything really slowly but some people might not understand me. So example number 2: you loan me 10 btc  + 10% interest. I pay you back in 6 months. But oh no the bubble burst :O Not a problem the loan was hedged. So if the value of a btc dropped back to 10 i would have to pay you 200btc+20btc interest. Hope i didnt complicate it too much :)
