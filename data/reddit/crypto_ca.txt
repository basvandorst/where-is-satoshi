Can other coins be added? Like ones on Binance?

If it’s not profitable, doesn’t that make bitcoin unsustainable and worthless as it scales? Again I’m new so I’m just trying to get some understanding. From my understanding, without mining, transactions won’t be verified and bitcoin won’t be created...if no one can make money verifying transactions then to me it seems like the critics of bitcoin are right in the sense that we are in a huge bubble. Am I wrong?

No, we’re not cloud mining, we will have the hardware in a small office suite.

Sure, but what about future mining? The miners who made money before won’t continue doing it if it’s no longer profitable.

Rent is about $300/mo. Electricity we are calculating to be around .10 cents per kw.

I haven’t invested yet but they have looked up a place to rent and the average cost of electricity. If I invest we will be buying 5 Antminer S9’s.

I’m just copy and pasting my response to another comment.
