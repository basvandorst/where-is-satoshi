Pledge: a solemn promise or undertaking. Charitable gift: A gift made by an individual or an organization to a nonprofit organization, charity or private foundation. The anonymous Bitcoin holder pledged (made a public promise) to donate $86 mil, of which $24 mil has been given (charitably gifted) to 31 charities thus far, providing solid reason to believe that the remaining $62 mil will be given as pledged.

Joining a mining pool is still feasible *if you are contributing enough hash power.* A laptop wouldn't. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:29:36
Yes but block rewards aren't random lottery tickets. And mining pools split block rewards by hash power, not just equally to any participant. With your laptop's hash power competing against data centers full of ASICs, the odds of you earning a significant portion of a block reward are infinitesimally small.

I chose my words poorly with 'lottery ticket', I was just responding to OP saying 'but one ticket'. But I know how it works well enough to know that with the hash power of a typical laptop you could mine for thousands of years and not get a single block reward based on the [current total hash rate]( If we're going the nitpick on words, yes its theoretically possible to solve the puzzle with a tiny amount of hash power. But what are the odds? 1/10,000,000,000? I don't know exactly, but I know that the odds are small enough that it would be doing OP a disservice to not encourage an alternative.
We're talking thousands upon thousands of ASIC miners that can do &gt;15 TH/s versus a single laptop that's doing maybe 10MH/s. It's like having never thrown a punch before, then getting into the octagon with a UFC fighter. You're not going to luck you're way into winning that fight.

In his paper [Hardening Stratum]( Ruben Recabarren says that "even an exhaustive use of encryption will fail to ensure miner privacy." He also talks about the heavy overhead encryption adds.

Braiins is supporting the new protocol in bOSminer, which is being developed as an open-source replacement for cgminer. That's the component on the mining machines that interacts with the mining protocol. 
bOSminer is currently in the developer testing phase but will be production ready soon. At that point, it will be possible for any miner to run Braiins OS + bOSminer + Stratum V2 on practically any modern ASIC regardless of support from HW manufacturers. Here's some more context about bOSminer if you're interested:  [
@_date: 2019-11-18 10:04:56
You're correct. Stratum V2 and BetterHash allow miners to choose the transactions they include in a block instead of the pool always doing it, so they prevent transaction censorship. However, they don't prevent somebody from getting a majority of the network hashrate and attempting a 51% attack. Any person or group with that much hashrate wouldn't need to mine with pools anyway.
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:13:37
Thanks for your feedback, it is much appreciated! You're right that V2 is a grounds up redesign. The main reason for keeping the "stratum" name is simply that we hope it will help with adoption, particularly for miners who aren't English speakers and might be harder to reach with content if they don't recognize the name.
I passed your comment along to Jan and Pavel so hopefully they can reply to points 1-3 if they get some time.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:08:54
We haven't heard from any manufacturers yet, but that's probably to be expected while the specification is still a draft. Perhaps that will change when it's published as an official BIP.
However, we are working to release a fully-open source BTC mining stack (bOSminer + Braiins OS + Stratum V2) so that any miner who wants to implement V2 in their operation can do so, regardless of support from HW manufacturers. (More info on the bOSminer + Braiins OS part of the stack here:  [ )
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:14:09
That's unrealistic from a business perspective. Most miners can't afford to spend electricity continuously for days without a high probability of earning any revenue. However, [Stratum V2]( allows miners to choose their own transaction sets while still mining with pools to stabilize revenue, so it effectively eliminates any problem of pool centralization once its widely adopted.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:48:04
That makes sense, thanks for the thorough reply!
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:02:54
Thanks for mining with Slush Pool! We couldn't work on projects like V2 and Braiins OS without you :)
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:42:32
It likely doesn't make a significant difference in profitability for retail miners, unfortunately. V2 can reduce overhead for bandwidth and physical infrastructure, but it doesn't change the two most important factors in profitability: cost of mining hardware and local cost of electricity.
@_date: 2018-10-22 08:48:17
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you'll be really lucky to get it back. As they explained, the proper action to take  if you want to receive BTC is to go to your wallet and copy and paste the address directly from there. Skipping that step costed you.  
It sucks that the user experience for cryptocurrencies is still this confusing, but that's the reality for now. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:25:27
It's expected that some miners will capitulate whenever a new generation of more efficient ASICs is released (e.g. s17's making s9's obsolete). All of the miners who can remain active while others capitulate will see profitability increase with the next difficulty adjustment, so it's a natural event that weeds out the least efficient miners and makes room for the next generation. In other words, not a cause for concern at this point.
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:09:17
Haha, even ELI15 might be tough but here goes... The part of v2 that's relevant to this post is 'Job Negotiation'. This essentially means that miners can choose which transactions they confirm instead of the pools they mine with choosing for them.
So with the current stratum v1, pools send blocks to miners for them to work on, and the transactions in those blocks are determined exclusively by the pools. In other words, the OP chart shows who has a say in which transactions get included in a block and which ones don't. With stratum v2, the miners themselves can propose the transactions that they include in their block, such that there could be e.g. 10 different miners all working to mine blocks that have different transaction sets from each other while still mining on the same pool. Meaning that each slice of the pie in that pie chart can effectively be broken down into many smaller slices of pie, as each miner in the pool now has the ability to choose different transactions to confirm than the other miners.
That still seems like it could be confusing so in an attempt to summarize:  
\- In V1, censorship resistance goes as deep as the pools. If there are only 10 pools, then there are only 10 entities determining which transactions can get confirmed. That's probably not an ideal level of censorship resistance long-term.   
\-In V2, censorship resistance goes as deep as the miners themselves. So even if there are only 10 pools, but each pool has 100 miners, then theoretically there can be 1,000 separate entities determining which transactions can get confirmed rather than just the 10 pools.
I hope that helps :)
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:29:49
bOSminer includes a reference implementation of Stratum V2. It's currently in the developer testing phase and we're working to get it out for the general public ASAP. You can read up more on bOSminer here:  [

Slush Pool currently merge mines Namecoin and RSK, but not Elastos or Vcash.
At this point, the liquidity for NMC has gotten so poor that it's difficult to convert it to Bitcoin and redistribute it to miners. The value has also dropped such that it would be a negligible amount even if it could be easily distributed.
We like the RSK project and will continue to support it as long as it remains feasible. However, the mining rewards are currently very close to zero, so RSK isn't incorporated into the Slush Pool miner dashboard. If value increases substantially it will surely be incorporated at that time.
As for Elastos and Vcash, the incentive to merge mine just isn't strong enough right now. Most of our miners would likely get a few dollars more per month at best. Moreover, those projects aren't being very actively used. E.g. the typical Elastos block has \~2-3 txs.
If any merge-minable coins increase significantly in value, we'll reevaluate supporting them to increase rewards for our miners. At this time, the value simply isn't there.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:44:14
Good questions! 
To your first point, transaction times: Transactions can be validated by nodes and propagated throughout the network in milliseconds. There is a big difference between validation (by nodes) and confirmation (by miners). E.g. If I want to spend $3 of BTC to buy a cup of coffee, the merchant on the other end of that transaction can accept the payment with extremely high confidence before it's been confirmed because I don't have much incentive to try to pull off a complicated double spend to save $3.
The tax thing is a much bigger barrier to adoption in my opinion. Supposing you got some Bitcoin and exchanged it immediately, you likely won't have any significant capital gains or losses to report, but it still makes your accounting way more complicated than if you never used cryptocurrencies. I think that the best hope we have is that enough countries adopt more reasonable tax policies for cryptocurrency transactions that the rest of the world has to come around to remain competitive. That seems like it will take years though. Another thing to consider is that Lightning adds a whole new layer of complexity to taxes. Is the act of opening and closing a channel the taxable event, or is every transaction within the channel taxable? The policy probably points towards the latter, but that's going to be 100% impossible to enforce if people are using non-custodial Lightning wallets.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:21:46
US is probably well under 10% currently, but China is anywhere from 50-70%. During the wet season in Sichuan (around May to September) it's a safe bet that more than 50% of hashrate is concentrated in that region alone. On top of that, the biggest 4 or 5 SHA256 ASIC manufacturers are Chinese companies. So I agree, mining centralization in China is still a legitimate cause for concern.
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:44:37

@_date: 2019-11-28 18:27:56
You're right, but in fairness to u/sickel_avocado, I don't think they're talking about a state actor trying to pull off a double spend for financial gain. Supposing there was a mass exodus of wealth from China through Bitcoin, would that not be an incentive for the CCP to attempt to erode trust in Bitcoin with no expectation of profiting directly from a 51% attack?

@_date: 2019-11-21 11:08:11
Pool centralization isn't a big issue to begin with IMO, but once [Stratum V2]( is widely implemented it will seize to be a problem entirely because the protocol allows miners to choose their own transaction set while still mining with a pool to decrease the variance of their payouts. If pooled mining didn't exist, most small scale mining operators would have way to high of risk to operate and there would only be maybe one or two dozen large mining operations total.

Basically a timelapse of this chart:  [
Pools usually identify themselves in the block headers of the blocks they mine, so it's possible to estimate what percentage of the total network hashrate each pool has at any time based on the percentage of blocks each is mining.

That's the gist of it, yes. Double check the address after you copy and paste it and the amount you're sending as there are no do-overs if you make a mistake. There are almost definitely some quick Youtube tutorials on it too if you want to be really comfortable with the process.

Somewhere on twitter I saw a chart showing a correlation between new users on Coinbase and the price increase. Saw a similar chart for increasing google searches and increasing price.

Last I saw (about two months ago) it was estimated to be ~18 months out for Bitcoin. It'll be implemented much sooner than that on other cryptos like Vertcoin and Decred. And now that SegWit is live, the hard part is over as far as consensus. So the decision is kinda already made, it's just a matter of developing the software at this point.

@_date: 2017-11-30 15:55:14
I think the main point I'd make is that the LN isn't going to be fractioned that way. For example, if you go on Amazon to buy something, you don't get on Amazon's internet hub you just get on the internet. If you use BTC to buy coffee, you don't need to have a channel to a coffee hub you just need to have one payment channel connecting you to a major hub. But you're right, whatever BTC you put in that channel isn't available until you close it. For me, I imagine the majority of my BTC will be in cold storage and then I'll have some smaller amount constantly in LN for small transactions, but I wouldn't put any BTC in that channel that I'll need immediately
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:18:06

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:55:14
Good questions. First the things I can answer for sure: people who run LN nodes are compensated by transaction fees (separate from Bitcoin tx fees). Yes, Bitcoin nodes can choose to help run LN but would need a good amount of bandwith and would need to store some extra amount of money to help route payments. I'm not positive about software implementation but it doesn't make sense to me that it would be a default part of Bitcoin core.

To be honest, while I don't like the politics at all, I think Bcash has some fair points. The fees and wait times have gotten completely out of hand and I do worry about LN still being a long ways out (probably over a year last I heard). But those issues were glaring at the beginning of the month and it still went up over 70% since then, so I also think that I just have no idea what's going to happen haha. 
Plus, necessity is the mother of innovation. In other words, high fees and long wait times will give people incentive to quickly adopt LN once it's available, which could help make LN robust and successful. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:27:44

@_date: 2018-11-01 21:32:12
Not an ignorant question at all.
1 important thing to know: the block reward is a step function and the final reward won't be earned until all of us are long gone from this earth (barring some crazy medical breakthrough.) Also, block rewards are only part of what makes mining profitable, the other part being transaction fees.
The total hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain is a way of quantifying how expensive it is to attack Bitcoin. In order to carry out a 51% attack, you need to control 51% or more of the total network hash rate. So theoretically you only need 1 miner with a tiny bit of computing power to keep processing transactions, but you need tons of miners with tons of computing power to secure the network.
If mining profitability decreases, some miners might quit, decreasing the total hash rate. As a result, the algorithm would decrease the mining difficulty (i.e. the difficulty of finding the nonce that solves the cryptographic puzzle and allows a miner to propose a block and earn themselves the block reward &amp; transaction fees from that block), making it less costly to mine and somewhat re-balancing the ratio of revenue to cost.
Basically, the answer is that mining will stay profitable for a very long time to come baring an event that causes Bitcoin to lose trust, such as a major bug explotation or a successful attack of some kind.

It's a bear market. If you're playing the short game, you should definitely get out now because who knows when things are going to turn around. But if you're playing the long game, the lack of interest in cryptocurrencies now shouldn't be very concerning. I was much more stressed out during the bull market because there was too much hype and vaporware was worth billions upon billions of dollars. Now the values are more realistic. The hype and mainstream interest will come back when projects with good products achieve real world adoption and build intrinsic value.

I said we'll be long gone before the final block reward is earned. That's true literally, so I don't know why you'd say it's nonsense. Additionally, the way that you earn transaction fees and the way that you earn block rewards are the exact same, you propose a block that gets added to the end of the longest PoW chain. Supposing transaction fees are becoming more valuable as block rewards shrink, if the total value of mining a block is still high enough the incentive to mine is just as strong.
Also, the relative value of Bitcoin is an important factor. If the block reward is 6.5 BTC, but 1 BTC is worth $50k, then the impact on the miner's profit margin is the same as if the block reward was 50 BTC but 1 BTC is worth $6.5k. Personally, I don't foresee a future in which Bitcoin just continues on in the $5k-$10k range. It will either achieve significant adoption in the next decade and become significantly more valuable or it will eventually die / forever be used only as nerd money, in which case this doesn't particularly matter.
