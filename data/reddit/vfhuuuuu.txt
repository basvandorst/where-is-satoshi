Bit = 1/1,000,000 BTC
Satoshi = 1/100,000,000 BTC
These should be the standard measurements.

I'm guessing that Bitcoin will be replaced by another currency far before then. As much as Hodlers want you to believe, Bitcoin isn't perfect, and there are problems that Forks, Lightning networks, or anything else aren't going to be able to fix. Currencies like Ethereum are objectively far better than Bitcoin due to the very fundamental code and technology they are based off of. It's really only a matter of time before some currency comes along that is so much better than Bitcoin, people are just going to switch to it.

Fun fact: Felix Baumgartner got his Facebook page deleted four years after his jump for supporting right-wing populists in 2016.

Once you've done the research and delve into the philosophy, it will become clear to you that we simply cannot go back to fiat. It's too dangerous to let the Government have control over the money supply. As such, cryptocurrency will ultimately be it's successor. It might not be Bitcoin, but some other currency will definitely do it. I have 100% confidence that crypto markets will expand well past their 2017 peak because of this.

I'm not saying this is a good thing. I don't agree with what he believes in, but I 100% believe in his right to say it. Facebook should absolutely not have done this.

I had $630 that I wanted to put into Bitcoin. When it was hovering around 6400, I thought that Bitcoin would drop a little more based on what it did during the previous crash cycle. Then I decided, nah, it wouldn't really matter in the long run anyway. Oh well.
Don't worry too much about when you buy right now. If you had bought at $3 and your friend bought at $2, you'd both still be plenty rich.

Do the math. They'll be about 18.5 million bitcoins in a year. 18.5 million x 7000 = $129.5 billion.

Price prediction: In exactly one year, on 12/21/2019, Bitcoin will be worth around $7000
