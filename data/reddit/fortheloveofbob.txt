Bitcoin attempts to make the math the regulator and central authority so that it is fair and impartial.  Everything is public and has well understood working parameters.  Everyone can see that the trust is close to being breached, unlike governments that can do things in secret.  I see this as a feature.

All the world over, so easy to see.

I didn't make any claims of government conspiracies.  I'm only suggesting that digital currency has the potential to improve transparency and fairness.  Governments and people can and will likely do bad things.  
By the way, I'm not Libertarian either, as your reference seemed to indicate all Bitcoin supporters are.  I'm not advocating the abolishment of regulation and government, I'd like to see better, cheaper, fairer, more informed, and more transparent regulation and government.

It's not always what they're doing, but why they're doing it.  Nefarious intentions are nearly always be cloaked in some way.  By the way, I'm not a conspiracy nut. I'm not saying that current government is bad or that Bitcoin specifically is better.  But it seems to me digital currency holds the potential to greatly reduce the possibility of corruption, and I applaud experimentation in that direction.

I basically agree that the community needs to react, but I think the solution needs to be a technological one.  Any currency can rely on politics to defend it, what is supposed to make bitcoin special is that it *can't* technically be manipulated.  If bitcoin is failing that test then it should be improved or replaced with a better digital currency.  But I think everyone should relax, this is the kind of test that bitcoin and any such digital currency must inevitably face and surmount.

I'm glad people are thinking about this.  Fascinating problem, almost paradoxical.  A coin must be untraceable, yet simultaneously, easily proven valid.
