I missed my chance and I do not understand it, I tried to learn it but its a little out there for me. That's okay. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:03:05
I downloaded the wallet from bitcoin.com it says bitcoin.com wallet. Did I just get fucked before I even successfully used bitcoin? Yay google. Sigh.

api-ms-win-crt-math-I1-1-0.dll is missing api-ms-win-crt-math-L1-1-0.dll

You are trolling me right? I am using armory. 
EDIT: FYI, ?I blocked you, its obvious your not trying to help me learn how transactions work or how to connect a wallet online or anything, your literally upsetting me more it seems, I have no idea what your issue with me was, I am looking for help, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:58:02
How would one go about doing this? Just get a usb and install the program on the usb?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:06:25
But I fucking hate Trump? What the hell is this? I am trying to get help with starting bitcoin, the hell are you trying to do guy?
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:59:10
I am, and the bitcoin.com website and the faqs and everything is really helpful. 
Do you have to spend money to mine? 
I checked my hash rate and its apparently 7.3 hash a second (yay laptop c:), so I don't think there is much I can do. :(
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:01:20
Theoretically its nearly at its peak then? Once its fully mined, what makes it retain value as an asset?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:31:59
I am literally new at this and it seems like your trying to scam me already... sigh. I am basically in a full financial hardship, I really just need help setting up an appropriate legitimate wallet, and then I can go from there, why are you showing me all this stuff when I don't even have a wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:19:14
:( True. I am on electrums website right now, I am on a windows laptop, should i do standalone executable or the windows installer? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:00:27
What are you talking about? I could not get a single one to install, I got armory to install, but now that I got a wallet I don't really know what to do from here. There is no conclusive guide to understanding this basically huh? I used to run Etal and scripts back in my d2lod days and stuff and I will admit that wallets/crypto currencies don't seem to be friendly to new people.

I just want to be able to fucking eat this month. I don't know what else I am really doing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:42:13
I do not have a smart phone, I do not enjoy the normal things people do, I have a flip phone, my laptop is also 6 years old. 
It seems armory is working, I am creating a wallet, I will keep this thread updated. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:26:38
Just gonna add a comment here, I installed Electrum and it says its fine, but when I try to open it, I get 2 error boxes/messages, one says:
"The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-math-l1-1-0.dll is missing, etc etc." Tells me to reinstall, same error everytime. 
Second error reads: 
"error loading Python DLL and it shows a program file link to electrum/python35.dll
LoadLibrary: The specified module could not be found. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:04:18
Once it loses value, that's a further incentive for its price to diminish completely, right?
EDIT: Actually, theres too much bitcoin and its worth too much for this to be a cog in the wheel. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:17:37
Great, still absolutely nothing about connecting to a network or anything... It says its offline. Why is it offline, It says it will go into online mode automatically. The "Preparing databases" is bolded but the bar isn't moving. 
I just want to connect now. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:13:35
Its all good. I won't lie, I am in literally the worst financial place a person can be without having his life threatened, I really appreciate the help man. 
Is there by any chance a science forum or something where people go and ask people to search for peer reviewed papers on their requested topic in trade for a small amount of bitcoin? 
EDIT: This is a service I know I can provide I just don't think its a thing, yet. c:
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:07:37
I do not need introductions, I need something to show me how it actually works, how to perform a trade with armory, how to earn a bitcoin, how to do trades legitimate, how to watch out for scams, how to know if you have been scammed, etc. 
I keep being told to look at everything bitcoin.org has available and its honestly confusing me more, it seems like everytime I try to find out how it actually works I keep getting told to go learn what it is. 
At this point I don't even think bitcoin is accessible to poor people like me, seems that everyone knows I am not of a certain class level or financial level or something and refuse to help me take the first steps to actually do stuff. 
Thanks though, going to be honest, I give up, going to Canada food bank to survive this december and uninstalling armory, I tried, I feel like my soul is tired. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:41:18
I researched, seems I am missing an update on my computer, cannot install it because it gives me an error. I have no clue. 
Also RPC (remote procedure call, its a service meaning someone is remote connected, but checking all settings and everything doesn't show anyone else or anything. I get something called "com surrogate" that runs often but only when I stop doing anything on my laptop for like 10-20 minutes) goes off by itself, if I turn the service off my laptop crashes, I believe I am best off not trying to open a bitcoin wallet it seems, and I do not have a smart phone. : /
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:38:15
Sigh I give up, been trying for a few days now and nothing but errors and nonsense. 
I honestly think this is just one big circle jerk and bitcoin doesn't exist, there's like 8 wallets on bitcoin.org but none of them work? Is this for real?
I am trying armory, this is my last attempt, sorry if I seem crotchety, I am just mentally exhausted. 
I have 38$ dollars for the entire month to live off of, my rent is payed but nothing else and my fridge is empty, all because I worked in october and am being penalized in december for it, so I won't lie, I am not psychologically okay atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:26:20
Actually i am getting a system error, keeps telling me uninstall and reinstall.

@_date: 2017-12-05 07:07:30
Is my email or information or anything compromised using bitcoin.com wallet? I didn't put any debit/credit card info or anything, just used my legit email and my real name. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:22:08
[Alright, Thanks man]( Its sfw. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:30:15
All the errors associated with this, all the windows updates that I apparently need and stuff ALL give me errors, electrum WILL NOT work it seems no matter what I do. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:22:21
[Because of this](
Doesn't work. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:52:32
Is there anyway a person who lives off of 800$ a month and has 14k debt could profit from this in anyway? : /
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:59:51
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:59:43
Buy it with what? I don't really know how bitcoin works, I was told you cant do it with a laptop, that you need a large sophisticated setup and zombie computers to mine bitcoin or something? idk. c:
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:05:15
Yup, most places abuse the 3 month probation here in Ontario, just worked 5 jobs in the last 8 months that all got arid of me at various times between the first and second month, and it was always for some sale/rush/event they have going on and then they let me go. 
Been out of luck for the last month or so though, so that number is accurate.
