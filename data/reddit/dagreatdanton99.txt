Sometimes I think, If we increase the block size to 2mb, what would Bcash folks do ?

This one never gets old :D

He's definitely has a lot less bitcoins as before. He's in deep loss due to selling all Bitcoins for Bcash

How does it feel to buy at the lowest price of 2018 ?

But they'll HODL you forever !

Keep your coins in either private wallet, or an exchange that supports  that fork.

I had a question I wanted to ask regarding segwit. If I create a segwit wallet in electrum, can anyone from non-segwit bitcoin address send me bitcoins ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:28:45
Years of HODLing experience ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:21:10
After years of such drama, only thing work is HODL !  ~ Every bitcoin veteran

It's time for 2mb blocks. Maybe even for few months, but we need it now. There is no shame/ego hurting here. Just plain listening to the users and customers.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:42:43
Exactly. Especially when most of the trading value is from Asia.

This thread is about price discussion. You think price fell because of the transaction fees ? This is just long due correction that had to happen as bitcoin was becoming unstoppable. It's healthy for the community to fall once in a while. If it doesn't fall, then it's characteristics of a bubble. You're mixing money with emotions. That's a noob mistake in financial world.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:59:36
It fell to 5500 from 7k that day, But this whale got eaten in a single day :D ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:24:37
Lol. This is the noob we're talking about :D
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:34:17
Ofcourse. 
Here's the post regarding the move of almost 25000 BTC to bitfinex.
And here's his own tweet that same day 
Same day, BCH price went from falling 600$ to $1400

Only 5 rich people using something doesn't makes a currency. They may use super computers to mine lot's of BU blocks, but what's the point if nobody wants it ? It's worthless. Their gamble is going to just drown them.

Coz he's not a billionaire. And nobody knows who is he ;)
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:08:57
Totally agree. But people don't care about the block sizes. People care about less transaction time and fees. Solution to that is not a fork, but improving bitcoin. Step by step, securely. If miners really cared about less transaction fees and time, they would have activated segwit. But they just care about the money and don't give a rat's ass about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:25:39
This is totally expected. If he wants to regulate bitcoin, tell him to get in line behind the chinese :D  We have been over china, India is not a big deal. Bitcoin will have to fight many governments ahead, and will always win !  
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:42:41
I think someone bought a alot coz of insider trading. Then many people's automated system sold the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:29:32
Buy now and forget about it for next 6 months. That's the best strategy.

You might wanna see this too then.
 
He claimed that MTGox was having no problems 7 months before the crash. He lied to all of us. Ask anyone who lost their money in the crash. He has a history of lying.

Everyone who trusted Jihan, pulled money from bitcoins and put it into altcoins.
So:   Altcoins price increased, bitcoin decreased.
Now Jihan's true lie is out, everyone is putting their money back into bitcoin. 
So.. Altcoins price is slowed down, bitcoin is back..
Bitcoin will always come back. Invest now.
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:56:32
The last guy bought at 3400 :D
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:55:00
It wasn't just charlie, Even jihan tweeted. Although he added "according to rumor", Which I think is just being safe. This move is actually a good move from China's perspective. Their Fiat is loosing. Crypto and ICOs are moving all the funds from the country to outside world. Ofcourse they are scared.

What he did was best for us. Telling us the news in advance saved us from insider trading. Also now trolls can't spread fake news just to manipulate the market. Transparency at it's best. He asked for HODL, because most of Chinese people might sell soon. See, there won't be any way for them to get yuan from their BTC if it becomes illegal. So winter is coming.

You all realise the FUD is no because of bankers right ? They say this shit all the time. China is the real culprit here.
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:39:40
I kind of wanted mining to be banned in China. Only then people would realise how centralised systems  ( b*cough* ) systems are vulnerable and why bitcoin is the future.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:34:33
I just can't wait for this 2x thing to get over. I think all people supporting Jihan and Roger have lost so much money, that they will finally start seeing the true picture. 
Anyways I just unsubscribed from the troll infected /btc. Had joined it read the opinions of the ""other" side. Finally it's good riddance. Time to focus on the one true bitcoin.

Finally i'll buy some Litecoin till segwit activates on BTC
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:32:57


BCC are forking the BTC but removing the segwit from it. Some of us does understand the technology and can clearly tell what's happening here. The whole game is for money and more control over the network.
Reasons given by BCC for the fork is network is crowded, slow and requires more transaction time.
BTC was never "slow". It was under a spam attack. Google for proofs. 
Now that the spam attack has stopped, most of the blocks mined are less than 1Mb.
Why no bigger blocks ?
More block size will only make mining difficult for small miners. 
So more block size = Less Small miners = Large corporation miners = Centralisation
Save Bitcoin. Dump BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:53:52
Bitcoin is invincible. Not matter what you throw at it, it'll come back, stronger, faster, better!

Copy pasting wikipedia and expecting people to start using it instead of the original wiki just because yo have more money isn't a very good thing. Think about everyone worked to make it what it is today.

It's still the dip ! BUY !
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:48:34
Activating segwit is gonna make the litecoin price skyrocket. It's just 30$ now, Im expecting around 100$ price jump..  and then a drop.
