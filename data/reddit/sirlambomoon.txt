Or what? It is not spam. I called it right, I am excited. I am 3 for 3 w BTC forks. I've played them all pretty damn good. Now let's grow crypto!!!

Bitcoin announces square cash with Jim Cramer involved mad money

You know when I investigate these people (highly regarded C-suite mainstream incumbents) on twitter, I see the same thing. A lot of them bad mouthing bitcoin and not a little bit, but a lot. I understand people fear change, but to me this trend is very telling. 
So I started to ask them "Why do you tweet so much about $btc? It appears you don't like it, is that true? If so, why so many tweets, and how does it negatively affect you? Genuinely curious." 
Like here - 
No response yet, but maybe others will see the reply and think outside of their eco-chambers and at peoples incentives

Could it be tied to an email address? That is strange on different phones. Did you leave your phones where someone could access them and send the coins out from your devices?

This makes no sense to me. Anyone else want to comment or give their opinions??

Cool. I find people either love or hate that guy, not much middle ground.

Good question. I know it's not December.

You chart it. Keep cash on sidelines. Then you buy at certain levels on the way down (Fib retracements). Interestingly, I just tweeted about this subject not even 3 minutes ago, lol 
But I do agree, if you don't know what you are doing, dollar cost averaging (DCA) is the way to go.
E: also I trade to increase my BTC holdings, with proper TA and a good pulse on sentiment you can profit. TA = when to buy, FA = what to buy.

All crypto is going up, BTC included :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:00:09
It may, but not for long. Way too much $$$ on sidelines looking for dumps, especially with CME coming onboard soon. If uncertainty priced BTC above 7k how could certainty keep it under for long?

Owning lots of bitcoin via CME futures requires shorting bitcoin via protip

I doubt it will drop. All the 2xers will only have BCH for their scalling. Besides BCH/2X want the same thing.

To be clear, I don't think I am a genius. You are labeling me that. I just have a system and strategy that has been working. 
Why will I join them? Because it fits your narrative and makes you feel better about missing the dips? Since there are people that have been succeeding and profiting for decades based on TA (fact) then that negates your point it's all bullshit. I missed many dips in the early days, but my desire to grow my stash w a limited supply of fiat opened my mind to things like TA. Thank god too.
TA is like most things in life, if you want to get better at it you have to devote time to it, plus it's hard. The people that spout off with statements of certainty (towards any field, not just TA), 9/10 don't understand it/are not good at it, so quit or don't even get started. 
My strategy for risk/money management has been working. Could I flame out? Sure, but my system ensure I don't lose the nut. And growing your crypto nuts is all that matters, at least to me anyway.

$4 billion bitcoin exchange who ran Russian cybercriminal suspected extradite
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:27:15
Yea but my profits say otherwise. FA = what to buy, TA = when to buy. 
If you think it's shit follow my live trades on twitter. I put the trades I place there in real time. I have developed a system over the years, based mostly on TA, and it has been working very well.

Can you give more details? IOS, android? etc.
