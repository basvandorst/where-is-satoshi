It's actually not that hard to be anonymous online (tor browser), the biggest challenge is being disciplined about things like reusing accounts and paying with my "dirty" bitcoin. And the fact that one mistake can (kind of) blow the whole thing up.
Timing attacks will always be possible (you accessed reddit at the exact time that my_real_name_is_dan posted!) but everything else is either
a) a bug that can be fixed or
b) a bad habit that can be avoided
the surface area for bugs is so large that right now it's almost impossible to avoid them all so I'll give you that. But we have a lot of eyes looking at them!

wow great response! I still don't know a lot about bitcoin, thanks for pointing out those weaknesses. I need to get an open source wallet which isn't going to upload my addresses. I'm not going to make the type of purchases that are so easy to trace through but yup, that's exactly the time of thing that is easy to fuck up and leak out information. Thanks!

Thanks for supporting bitcoin! I haven't done this myself but here's what I could find, overall **bitpay** does look like a good option.
**Accepting bitcoin:**
There's nothing that bitcoin itself requires you to do differently to recieve payments, you just need a bitcoin wallet.
 
To integrate with your ecomerce site, something like bitpay could be really useful, if you've already got an ecomerce system, you'll need to find a plugin for your system and have it installed on your server 
**Cashing out:**
Bitpay offer a very fast conversion to USD with a very small transaction fee. otherwise you can find one of many bitcoin exchanges.
You still have to pay tax on your BTC transactions and I've heard of a 10,000 dollar daily limit in some territories(?) I'd say don't worry about it today, if you're swamped with payments, that's a nice problem to have!
**No I don't work for bitpay!**
