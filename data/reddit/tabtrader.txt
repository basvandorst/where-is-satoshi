Credibility of the service compared to regular scammy fx binary options is that the price is streamed directly from  Bitstamp.
And another cool thing is that you don't need to login it anything. All you need is your regular bitcoin wallet.

 to be able to control the movement of funds within your account on a particular exchange through a third party app you first would have to generate API keys. You have to decide what the third party app will be able to do once granted access to our account via API, i.e. monitor balances, manage order and also withdraw funds if you wish. After successfully generating API keys, you paste them in TabTrader, thereby adding an account to the app.
See and example here:
Does that answer your question?
