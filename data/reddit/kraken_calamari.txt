omg it's so good.  
just season 1 though
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:58:31
definitely a real question.  I had my suspicions but have no idea how it compares to fiat money energy consumption (which, as was pointed out is a moot point since bitcoin isn't a viable currency)  
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:23:52
seriously?  damn, wtg, china.  
just curious, do you have a link to a story about that?
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:37:52
no, wait till I get paid tomorrow!

yeah, my bad we apparently shred old money because it's old, nothing to do with inflation.  
  
this is why I should google before posting 
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:40:22
that's a really interesting point.  do you think there's a cryptocurrency out there right now that could be used as a currency?  Is that even desirable?  
I think I heard somewhere ethereum is inflationary.  
But imo their smartcontracts being turing complete is actually a problem more than anything due to things like the halting problem.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:26:05
apparently people are saying stuff like, "no it's just digital gold now, not currency." due to so many vendors not accepting bitcoin anymore.

this is a soft fork, right?  
do I have to do anything like download a new client or... anything?

dude, turtle's are awesome!  [haha look at him go!](  w-wh-where's he think he's going?
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:13:49
could one make an argument that crypto encourages overconsumption due to miner competition?  
forgive the probably stupid questions, I'm super new to all this stuff
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:53:18
dang, wish I could afford a full bitcoin.  I'm excited for you!  
good luck and as others have pointed out, hold that shit!
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:36:27
I understand we also burn massive amounts of money every day to keep inflation down

oh.. sorry, man, it was a really obscure and out of place reference to the main antagonist in morrowind.

dagoth ur would like a word
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:58:45
could you elaborate?  genuinely curious
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:21:12
honestly I'm a little impressed the currency outlived the meme
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:18:52
wow such hodle many resilience  wow

it's a distro that pushes all traffic through tor by default and only runs off a flash drive  
edit: downloading it also puts you on a list :D
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:45:56
rock them back on you'll catch a cold!
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:58:11
is it really *that* controversial to say that bitcoin needs to be used as a currency in order for it to continue to be worth something?
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:41:03
I'm no wrong with that.
