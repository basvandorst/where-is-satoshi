I'm gonna try and parse this into a more precise statement: 
"The money supply of Bitcoin is currently increasing by 8.8% p.a.; after the block reward halves next year the increase will drop to 4.2% p.a. At the current rate, Bitcoin is ranked 145 out of 158 in terms of increase in money supply compared to fiat currencies and will be ranked 69th next year."
If true this is a pretty important fact. Does anyone know if (a) it is true and (b) can provide a source, especially for the increase in money supply of fiat currencies?
**Edit**: Found some data for USD: Monetary Supply (M2) has increased by 6% on average over the past 35y.

I'm not an economist, but I think it's misleading to call the orange line in that graph inflation. If I get it correctly it could be called something like change in money supply. So according to that graph (which is awesome btw), at the moment the bitcoin supply increases by about 8.8% annually. After the block reward will be halved next year, that number will drop to ca 4.1%.
It's interesting to compare that number to the change of money supply of fiat currencies. I could find some numbers for the USD, and it seems that money supply has been pretty flat in the past year, but had grown at &gt;5% before that since about 2009. Numbers for the renminbi seem similar.

**tl;dr**: In the past, Bitcoin has been _more_ inflationary than fiat currencies. That is about to change.

Why don't we all send them an email? (address is pretty easy to find)

This is pretty awesome. There are so many great business ideas based on decentralization that will seem completely obvious in a few years. We need to start thinking about them now...

Yup. Some smart guy (forgot who) once said: "Innovation usually takes longer than expected but has a bigger impact then expected." I think this image is the explanation as to why.

This part of the article is just brilliant

I am building a similar (but different) service atm. Email henry if you'd like a notification when it's ready, will not email you about anything else.
Also: Good luck with your project rolandnsharp, sounds very cool :-)

One day I want to be on that level of rant

Honestly I do not like the idea a lot. You will only buy one if you don't understand that you will be losing money. Does not sound like a sustainable business model to me.

Google translate of the article:
"The economy expert Peter Bofinger campaigns for the abolition of cash. "With today's technical possibilities coins and notes are in fact an anachronism," Bofinger told SPIEGEL.
        
If cash went away, the markets for undeclared work and drugs could be dried out. In addition, it would make it easier for the central banks easier to enforce its monetary policy. The economics professor teaching in Würzburg called on the federal government to promote at the international level for the abolition of cash. "That would certainly be a good topic for the agenda of the G-7 summit in Elmau," he said. (Click here to read the full interview in the new mirror.)
        
The former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and economist also pleaded for to end cash. Likewise, the US economist Kenneth Rogoff. He also argued that the interest rates of central banks have less clout when banks or consumer credit rather than hoard cash.
        
Critics warn, however, such debates would only distract from the real problems of the current monetary policy."

I think this is an experiment worth having. Probably going to build something like this quite soon.

What I find interesting here is that Jason has been pretty critical of Bitcoin in the past. Apparently that has changed...
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:22:30
Yeah, totally agree. I wish bitcoin devs could finally go back to a more effective use of their time than fighting on Reddit.

The more I learn about bitcoin 2.0 tech like payment channels, smart contracts, and the lightning network the more I think that a block size increase might be less urgent than people think. As far as I know the most important change that is needed to enable these technologies would be fix to transaction malleability (seg wit would do that). I think no matter if you support big or small blocks, segregated witness is something we should all rally behind to enable the next wave of bitcoin innovations.
This is coming from someone who is running a 100% bitcoin business. My incentives as an entrepreneur are to scale bitcoin, keep tx costs low, and to do that now. However, the vision to getting a solution to the scaling problems while maintaining a high level of decentralization via smaller blocks is very tempting.
