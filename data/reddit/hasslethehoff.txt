remittances are huge, but there's a problem because once the money is sent, it's difficult to spend bitcoin in certain countries, so they'd need to change to local currency

don't they use monero or zcash now?

LN lowers the fees and removes the barrier for common currency purchasing, even if it's a deflationary asset, it can still be used to purchase common items. Although your point is fair, why purchase items with something that theoretically would increase in value, the buyers remorse will continue to be strong, I just wonder why we don't feel that way with the USD, the changes in value are too small to be noticed as it is with bitcoin
