Don't they destroy a lot of the old bills before releasing more?
I know there is still a net increase, but they're pulling the old 20s out of circulation.

What's the reasoning behind that? Is there any legal reason holding them back for that or are they still 'testing' BTC for only a portion of their customers?

How much initial capital would it take to make the price fluctuate enough to be profitable for them?
I'm assuming if someone bought 10k BTC the price would jump up enough to make a decent profit by selling it the next day. Is this true or do I not understand this well enough?

I haven't heard about this at all, but am happy about it. Can you give a source for it?

Hmmm.. Chrome didn't give me an option to translate the page into english. Is there a different option for that?
Edit* nevermind, it popped up after I clicked around a bit.

Realistically  where is it likely to settle? I know it's extremely hard to guess, but honestly I'd much prefer it to fluctuate a lot less. I just feel like big spikes mean big dips eventually, like last time

The point is to sell at the value you raised it to. It's not an effort to raise the price of BTC for the long term, only long enough for you to sell at a higher value that what you bought at.

Can't you just tumble them?
I don't see anyone else mentioning tumbling. Did the verb change to mixing?

So if you have enough capital can't you just repetitively buy/sell  in large amounts and yo-yo the market for your own profit?
God I with I had that much capital.

Really glad they added this. 
I haven't looked at what their fees are yet, but it's not paypal so I'm happy.

I've been putting a lot of time into bitcoin for the last 9 months, and I can honestly say that I had no idea MT.Gox had any relation to Magic the Gathering.

you claim its not possible... now there are posts all over claiming manipulation. So it seems like my question is valid.

When do you expect to have everything paid off?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:44:39
I think it's pretty fair.
If you want short term gains you can manage it if you are lucky enough to time it right. If not then you can easily lose money.
If you want long term gains, even if you don't time it right you can eventually make a fair profit despite volatility and price swings.

This is a huge sign of more adoption. It's amazing to have that much coverage.
