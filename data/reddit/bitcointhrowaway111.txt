YOU USED YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNT TO ASK PEOPLE TO UPVOTE THIS POST.

I'm assuming that you're violating reddits TOS, by asking people to upvote your posts so that you can get more donations.
Why would I believe a liar and manipulator like you?  Your kid didn't make the programs, you've tried to scam money from redditors by artificially inflating your exposure, you're pretty much a thief.
But now you've been exposed.

Good on you!  Let me help.
Give this guy 5 BTC @_date: 2014-09-30 12:04:07
Here's some help paying them back, you know, since the price is plummeting.
1 BTC @_date: 2014-10-13 08:15:56
So your perfect future is a combination of some Galtian dystopia nightmare mixed with WALL-E?

You're obviously an idiot so I'm not surprised you don't see the problem with your moronic pump idea.
It's only free money if the giftee converts to fiat or uses it to buy from a vendor who converts to fiat.  Otherwise it's totally worthless.
But, again, you're obviously dumber than a box of doorknobs, so I'll let you get back to huffing gasoline, or staring at the sun, or whatever it is you do when you're not trying to pump the price of the ponzi scheme you got suckered into.

I'll help you get started.
10 BTC @_date: 2014-06-30 22:18:43
Cool.  Well then I'll just go ahead and post something asking for money for something "my kid made", tell my facebook friends to upvote it so I can get more money, and then plead ignorance when I get caught.  
Since that what we're doing now.

What test users?  The ones who downloaded a game they thought was finished?


No, it isn't.  You make people watch ads to play or pay to remove them.  That isn't free, that's charging either time or money.


Anyway, good job!  Bitcoin needs more entrepreneurs like yourself who can profit from empty promises.

He just told you there are issues.
Other people are telling you there are issues.

Have **you** ever done product testing?
It doesn't seem like it.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:41:02
Sure, pass the blame along.
Good job on getting a broken scam on Apple.  That's great for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:45:46
I found the reason- this is a scam and you are a liar.

Having this in your business but not accepting bitcoins basically makes this thing a really slow slot machine that's really difficult to cash out.
