...but what if the ASIC miners ARE the 51% attack?

Your reason  and reason  contradict each other. For reason  you say the "hype is already built" and that with said hype, you only have a $100 billion market cap. But then for reason  you say that only 1% of the general population in the US even know what cryptocurrency is. Don't you think there's a lot more hype to go and higher market caps to attain if that 1% became anywhere near 100%?

Regardless of the coin, BTC or BCC, that ends up winning out, can we all agree that this ideological and hard fork has reduced the security of both currencies? BTC is approximately 30% less secure to a 51% attack than it was before the fork. United, bitcoin was the undisputed king of cryptocurrency, resilient to external forces. With every major disagreement within the bitcoin community and potential hardfork, bitcoin's dominance and internal security is jeopardized.

It doesn't matter where you bought it. Once you co-mingle your bitcoins, not just the government but anyone can track all the purchases you have ever made. All it takes is for one transaction to be linked to you for this to happen.

what happens if you put tainted A coins in with tainted B coins, along with tainted C coins, and no untainted coins. Do you get out untainted coins for all? 
What if you put in 99 tainted coins and 1 untainted coin, do you get out 100 untainted coins, or is there a potential for someone to say all 100 are now tainted coins?
