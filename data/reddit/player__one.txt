You have to evaluate your risk tolerance. What does "hurt" mean? If it means canceling a vacation or some shit and you think it's a good idea, do it. If "hurt" means you could lose your place to live, relationship, or not be able to eat, don't fucking do it.

I just bought a mining contract. Has anyone done this? The ROI seems really good for BTC right now. I didn't buy a contract with any of the weird "you can earn .5 BTC a day" people. I researched it an this seems legit.

I have no evidence at all. It' a hunch. They're definitely allowed to buy crypto. There are many hedge funds investing now.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:19:12
Perhaps an herbal method of self-medication?
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:57:50
This is great. I mean, not really short term, but I think long-term it is. Basically, this is saying the market will correct down to 3k then who knows. This seems in line with a lot of the stuff I am seeing from talking heads. Many seem to agree that 3k could be the bottom this year and it'll trade at anywhere from 40-60k at it's peak this year depending on which talking head you watch.
Don't invest recklessly. Don't gamble with what you can't afford to lose and only take the gainz you need to live. Ride the wave. Buy the dips if you can afford to. See you on the moon.

2:1 means that I'll get $2 back for every dollar invested basically 100% upside. Electric and maintenance is factored into the cost of the contract. Their site is seemingly really transparent

Right now the 12 month ROI at current price for BTC is about 2:1
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:26:40
Sure. though to be fair my "settling" point allows for a fair bit of fluctuation.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:28:21
Yeah, you're probably right. It's bigger than just Wall Street. It may be China putting their thumb on the scale right now and not the US at all.
At the end of the day, I wouldn't worry too much about it. The exchanges are so backed up right now that there is a ton of money sitting sidelined trying to get in.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:26:26

@_date: 2018-01-26 05:43:30
not so. they will let you withdraw coins after verifying. Also, they are putting laundering controls in place to allow for transfer in.
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:14:09
Awesome! I just registered. This is so great. Easy, painless process. I was able to transfer 5k from my bank account via ACH to them without an id check and already have 1000 available for stock trading since crypto isn't ready until February.
Some things to look out for:
Only available in 5 states at come February for crypto
They don't allow for coin to be transferred into the exchange. Once it leaves, it can't come back. They say this is a money laundering safeguard, I think it allows them to use your loot like a bank would because it keeps cash on the exchange.
They say you'll need to verify your identity to cash out.
There is no web platform available at current.
The app looks tight as fuck
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:42:14
Warning: The following is based on nothing more than a hunch.
We are done moving much and will settle in between 10k and 12k for the next couple months as the dust settles in Asia. I realize that's a big swing, but I think we'll see it stay closer to 12 than 10 for the majority of time.

I invested a decent sum at 11.8 and as soon as I can, I will be purchasing more. I plan to hold long-term, so the difference in price between 10, 11 or 12 is negligible to me.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:24:34
As a Red Sox fan, this forum is comforting to me. No Sox fan ever, well up until the repeat World Series win in 2007, would say anything positive ever really until the game was over. The Sox would be up by 8 and there'd be people all over saying things like, "I hope they don't blow this lead. There's still two innings left." 
I love your FUD, it makes me think of the Sox in my teenage years. Are you wrong or right? Time will tell. I don't know what'll happen. I own Bitcoin and it's become an obsession of sorts, so for me, the ride is fun. Watching the price of Bitcoin in real-time, especially when it's really moving is akin to sitting at the blackjack tables. 
One thing is for certain. If you own some Bitcoin, no matter how much, you'll be able to tell your kids and grandkids how you helped to usher in the collapse of the global financial banking industry and changed the world. That's pretty fucking cool. 
See you on the moon.

I was wrong on the ROI calculation, but after playing with it some more, I have it pegged at a 157% Return. 1.57:1.  The commission you pay is 28.75% which covers all electric, operation and maintenance of your miner and it's deducted from your daily payout. 
I invested 3 grand more this morning and now have 14.6TH mining for me.

Nope. You're right, I should have said the only losers sold lower than they bought.

That's good shit right there.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:21:21

@_date: 2018-01-31 22:12:40
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:50:36
That's not true. If you read their site you'll see that you can withdraw your actual coins after providing ID. They are working on permitting coin in, but need to finish building out their anti money-laundering protocols.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:59:58
It doesn't exactly work like that. The CC company presents the chargeback to Coinbase who can dispute it and would. They'd say, "Well, they accepted the TOS, provided photo id to verify, and had 2 factor authentication on. Case closed you wouldn't be getting your money back. 
I think a more likely scenario is that CC issuers have seen a spike in the transactions and feel the market is too volatile, so there's too much risk of default.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:49:03

What's your stop-loss point? HODL is a great strategy long-term, I think. There is a play short term even with a part of the investment to sell low and buy back in lower with the same money.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:17:00
You are so lucky. They won't even respond to a support ticket as to why buys are suspended on my account.

BTC should grow for the forseeable future. Steemit predicts there are less than 3.3m users and 40% of BTC is currently controlled by 1000 people. We aren't even close to mass adoption yet.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:43:14
The only losers, sold. You can't lose if you HODL. Is there an end? Possibly, but I think it's pretty far out.

Liquid cash? 70% crytpo. All in Bitcoin, because everything else is just trying to be Bitcoin.

Still don't believe me?
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:35:03
I'm not going to get all preachy and tell any of you what to do. All I am going to say is that I purchased for the long haul. I am in. I believe that BTC could trade at 3000 this year and I also believe that 50k is possible. 
I am really new to the space having only gotten on the train in December, but fuck all. One thing has become pretty clear to me. No one knows what the fuck they are talking about. Some people get lucky and people think they know shit, but they don't. 
Will I speculate? Sure. I'll also be the first to admit I don't know shit. I know that for me, buying Bitcoin was the right decision. I honestly believe that Bitcoin is going to change the world.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:05:11
I would personally choose something like Neo that seems to trail Ethereum by about a year. It's billed as Ethereum 2.0 and it's probably due for a pretty large year.

I really mean it. I think we are about to change the way humans interact with each other. Blockchain is the next "internet." 
I can see the folks feeling like their already on the moon. To them, I say, "Thank you. You were or still are a trailblazer. If you think we've hit the moon, strap in because the rocketship ain't slowing down. We are heading for Mars or – beyond." 
To me, the moon is when we've reached widescale public adoption and the unbanked are able to bank, have instant access to capital and things like credit don't matter. Imagine how many lives will be changed through BTC micro-loan programs? Maybe I am an idealist. I'd be lying if I said that the potential to earn money isn't a motivator for me, but a lot of the risk for me personally is offset by the contribution to the advancement of the tech.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:09:25
My honest take on this is that Wall Street is manipulating the price to determine what it'll take to cause a mass sell and how much needs to go back in to send it the other way. I am fairly confident there are firms colluding to manipulate.

@_date: 2018-01-31 14:23:01
Fair points, I think. At some point, people start not holding as long because they figure the large gains are gone and 2-3% is a good time to jump.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:27:01
This is all legit. I think Neo is going to be the next thing. It's Ethereum except the contracts can be written in a variety of languages.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:55:56
This makes me nervous. Last weekend, I deposited 10k with Coinbase and the money debited my account, transaction seems legit and then the day before my BTC is supposed to show up, I get an email saying they are canceling the transaction. Since then, no communication whatsoever. 
Here's the thing, I bought in at the near peak of BTC, so I win on the cancellation. Here's to hoping my money shows up.
The thing for me is that the transaction was just canceled on Friday and with Christmas tomorrow, I probably won't see that money until the end of next week the soonest. Since five business days is reasonable, it could be the week after. 
I worked in the financial industry a decade ago. These exchanges from what I can tell are poorly run or just overwhelmed or both. Every single exchange takes forever to get verified on. The process for buying BTC is way too fucking complicated and difficult for even people who know their way around a computer.
You want to see BTC go to 100K? Make it as easy to acquire. The way it sits right now is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:45:47
That isn't typically true. Take for instance the great depression or even the crash in 2008. The losers made a run to try to avoid losing it all. The Buffets of the world continued to buy. Do you really think that bitcoin has a shot of going to zero? If so, cut your losses, but I maintain that people who maintain their positions fare better than those who panic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:05:41
10k at 19.6 here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:09:10
HODL that shit. 
Listen folks. This isn't intended to be financial advice, because let's face it when anyone talks about  crypto, they're blowing smoke up your ass. No one really knows what's happening. 
Ok now that we have established the ground rules, the only people who will lose in this dip are the people who jump ship. You have to take a long ball approach right now and maintain your position and if you can afford to, buy more. 
I just put 10k in at 19.6k this past weekend. It's my first step into the crypto-pool, but if you study financial history at all you'll find that in most cases, the people who lose are the ones who sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:47
I bought in near the top of the market last weekend. Still hasn't posted to my Coinbase account. It's not like it matters that the transaction takes forever, being as it's way down now. 
Here's the thing, I invested seed capital from my business that otherwise would have been in the bank, so I'm fine. I'm not in the least bit nervous. My gut says 50k in 2018 is a reasonable value for a coin.
I think the downward trend will continue sub 10k with a strong January - February bounce. How do I know? The same way we all know, gut intuition and bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:11
that's fair. I put bitcoin more in the class of the stock market broadly rather than one company going bust.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:41
I bought 10k at 19.6 and I am straight hodl. 50k in 2018. 
See all your hodlers then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:50:57
I bet sub 10k with the panic selling that'll happen at 12
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:32:03
Yall want to hear some funny stuff? I bought in at 19.6k last  Saturday for 10k USD. Coinbase screwed up, they canceled my order. It's odd because the money debited my checking account and I verified with a passport, driver's license and via webcam. 
I have never been happier about a 10k mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:53:25
I bought at 19.6k. East come, easy mother fucking go.
I'm waiting for my damn transaction to post from last weekend so I can buy this dip.

I believe that an argument can be made for both LIFO and FIFO withdrawals, which would impact the taxability of the transaction. Once you commit to a rule you need to follow it forever, however. You should not take our advice and consult a tax accountant.

Isn't it more logical that we'd start to speak in terms millibitcoin? I mean sure the price increase over time, but that just leads to greater adoption where the smaller units of bitcoin are worth using in everyday speech. We should probably start doing this now. The current price of mBTC is $4.51

I think, therefore I am.
If you think that BTC has no value, get out if you can. There's no reason to gamble your hard earned cash on something you don't believe in. If you do that, you'll just make yourself angry. If you believe in BTC and not just the value of BTC but the real functional advantage of it and the possibilities, then you should HODL.
I am not a master of the tech nor do I claim to understand the inner workings of Bitcoin. l just believe that the folks who I listen to are smarter than I am and I'm willing to take the chance on being in on the ground floor of something amazing. I think that Bitcoin will change the world. Hundreds of Billions of private dollars flow from private hands into the developing world every day and nearly always carries a fee way greater than Bitcoin. If Bitcoin only fills this gap, it'll be larger than it ever was and it will change the lives of the unbanked in the developing world.

I typed that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time. Still wrong. w/e. GF’s out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I’LL TELL YOU WHY. It’s because I’m a bad trader and I KNOW I’M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT’S GOING DOWN I’M GONNA SELL he he he and then they’re like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY’RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I’m not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I’m already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU’RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying “OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD” YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

True, though I would bet they'll keep applying downward pressure until no one else is selling. At that point, they'll have picked up giant stacks if their strategy is to suppress the price to build stacks. Once they release the pressure we'll probably see them test out dumping on the way up again. I'm holding my coins. Eff these whales. You can't buy my coins.

It's an accumulation strategy. The whales are building stacks by applying downward pressure. I wouldn't be surprised if there is collusion.

You actually made the argument FOR investing in Bitcoin.
"Paper money just becomes more worthless every day--you know that already... Invest in real stuff that goes up in value due to rarity."
Do you even Bitcoin, bro? 
"If everyone just invested in gold and silver, everyone would win. Absolutely. You can't create gold &amp; silver out of thin air. No alt-gold possible." 
Bitcoin is far more fucking rare than silver or gold. Them shits aren't even rare. They're shiny fucking rocks.

Does anyone know anything about Elliot wave patterns? 
I am really new to Bitcoin. I just started learning about the tech and Bitcoin in December during the boom. I started to buy sub 12k. My really amateurish understanding of predictive trading tools leads me to believe that this may be the 5th wave of the Elliot wave, which would extend down probably below the last bottom near 5k before a violent bounce probably back to 10k.
Does anyone have any insights or thoughts?

All them cats that bought in high and have been riding this coaster since January, there's a good chunk that are going to want off the ride as the price comes back to the point they bought in at. There were no weak hands on the way up the first time.

My experience is that they don't get it at all. I would venture to guess that if I were put into a room with 100 random people in the US and we were asked who had ever owned Bitcoin, maybe 1 or 2 other people would raise their hands.

Here's an insight for you. When trying to convince others your position is correct, acting like an asshole is rarely effective. I'm not saying you're wrong by the way nor did I assume I know more than anyone or that I am applying this to my investing strategies. I am simply learning more about trading tools and since others know more than myself, I was appealing to them to deepen my learning. 
As you were.

You can buy from localbitcoin hassle-free in minutes. Also, you can buy bitcoin in the cash app and the price is the median price across exchanges at that time. Right now the price is like 10 bux higher than gdax. I haven't used the cash app, but it's super convenient.

Your guess is as good as anyone's. I can't see a bottom lower than 7500, but I don't know shit. I think the longer we keep going sideways, the more likely it becomes that it continues to travel lower, but I think 7500 is the floor.

There's are probably enough buy orders at that price that they can close their entire position and be out?
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:05:04
I don't agree. The longer it bounces here there greater the likely-hood of a breakout to another high. A slow climb also allows us to re-establish support lines on the way up. This is not going to be an easy climb. We are going to hit significant resistance all the way to 20k.

Sorry man. I feel your pain. I actually tried to buy at the ATH. I was new, I guess still am, and Coinbase screwed up my id verification, so they canceled the buy. I ended up giving a couple folks a gift of BTC I bought at 16k (what a crappy gift). I got in initially at 11.7 and have been buying on the way down so reduced my cost basis and am finally above water. Keep HODLing. it'll get there

Gemini. I like them. The confirm time was more than a month. Unless you wire money you can only deposit $500 per day, but it's pre-credited so usable immediately. They won't let you withdraw fiat or coin from their exchange until your deposit clears, which is fair. Also, the limit has forced me to DCA and as a result, I have a much lower buy-in level than my initial buy-in in the 11s.
Coinbase is a cluster fuck. That's just my experience. Most people have no problems. Cash App looks wicked easy, but I have never used it. Bitflyer confirmed me in less than a day, but I haven't used them yet for a buy. Bitstamp had a long confirm time of over a month.

We are well past the cock gobble resistance line. Macaffee is on target to not have to cannibalize his own cock on TV.

Breakfast is for suckahs. We need that sweet pump action they've been handing us the last couple days before Europe wakes up to dump it.

You should change the bet to they'll each get 5 USD in BTC. Just have them open wallets

Gemini. Easiest is probably with the Cash App if you're in the US.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:13:01
on the iphone app, there's a button in the middle that says cash and btc. i click that then click the btc tab at the top right, then buy. I can also do it by clicking on my profile photo.

Allow me to be the optimist for a moment. You risked your Roth IRA, so what? It was a long-term investment before, right? New ATH. You'll more than double your money this year. Nothing is guaranteed, but I believe the odds are heavily stacked in your favor.
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:46:49
come on ASIA, wake up and start the pump!

why the sigh of relief now? We've already retraced beyond this from the low this year.
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:26:44
The big pumps back to back days came just as Asia was waking up. I think they already Fomo'ed in from 9k-9700. We'll see them making moves again after 9700
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:23:36
Doubtful. Most people with serious holdings likely filed an extension.

How much to cross your bridge or do you ask 3 questions? If you ask questions, do you have them pre-written or think them up on the spot?

when i click my profile pic it shows me a list of my accounts. one of the options is btc and when i click on it I have the option to buy or sell. Dunno, maybe someone here has a droid
@_date: 2018-04-18 23:30:18
Also, I think you win this bet. New ATH by the end of July.

This is what Tone Vays is saying. He is actually saying the week neede to close at 9600 to show a reversal and anything short would have him projecting lows with the next floor probably at 5000.

Heijin Lee says you can't paint it a breakout until after 11.8
edit: I just watched his video from today and he is saying a 5 move Elliot wave up into July to new ATH followed by a 50% correction.

Watch Heijin Lee on Youtube.

I expect another pump from Asia, like last night, when they wake up to see this movement.

It's not illegal in crypto because it's unregulated. They would get screwed hard in the traditional markets.

I prefer Gemini. You can deposit $500 a day and they advance you the loot until your ach clears their account. You just can't withdraw any balance where the ach hasn't cleared.
