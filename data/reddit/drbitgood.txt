Rest of the world goes to [Cobinhood]( 0 transaction fees as well; based in Asia.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:00:33
This is a new Asian exchange; they have 0 fees and I think they take all countries:
Yeah... Cobinhood... Robinhood... the cease and desist in regards to the name is already on the way... 
Cobinhood also has its own coin. They don't have many of the big coins atm, but they are adding new ones constantly.
Should be big (I'm invested).
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:02:22
This one has 0 fees too, and EU people can use it:

It's interesting how these S-Curves tend to become steeper, which means the entire process becomes shorter over the years. I'm assuming the reason for this is that word of mouth can spread quicker with better mass communication.
Means the BTC S-Curve could be even steeper...
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:13:29
Which chart? Where do you see that it's one single entity?
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:20:33
That would make sense. How do you know though?
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:23:23
Actually, 2 places is enough. I mean, how likely is it both houses will burn down at the same time...?
If you should lose one of seed copies for any reason, you immediately find another place to store a copy. Storing them in 3 or more places doesn't reduce overall risk, it increases it.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:07:19
I noticed volume of BCH is down significantly. Only 227m today. A couple of days ago it was 1,300m, if memory serves me correctly.
Still the price is only going down extremely slowly.
Does that mean BHC price is not supported by trading anymore, and now the inflation from mining rewards kills it off very slowly?
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:12:12
Hasn't dropped lower yet. Always going back up when nobody mines.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:13:20
Doesn't look like it to me. 
How long does it take to mine one block?
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:12:54
Don't forget that some miners were mining both, BTC and BCH simultaneously. The world isn't just black and white, and people are driven by many different motives.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:17:58
At the risk of repeating myself... I don't see the price collapse (yet).
Somebody must be buying, I guess. Or maybe the mined amount doesn't make that big of a difference after all (look at the volume).
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:15:39
Depends on how many BTC you own...
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:54:23
I don't understand your question either. If you mean "deflation-like response":
Less coins will absolutely trigger an inflation-like response. But that's good, not bad. Contrary to what many "experts" say, deflation is not bad for a healthy economy. It's only bad for a sick economy that needs the cheap shot of the inflation drug to stay afloat.
Motivating people to save, rather than to spend, is ultimately healthy for an economy.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:08:01
You guys are doing it right with your kids. Great little humans!
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:53:37
Your "killing" is two donations with a combined total of $44 so far.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:18:23
Ha ha ha, this is excellent!
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:28:25
You can only buy it on Bitfinex so far. I even discovered a IOTA paper wallet page.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:47:39
But BTC already had a major rally before BCH, $2,800 - $4,200.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:10:58
But price should have gone down slowly then. It did 1 or 2 days ago, but it always jumps back up during the periods with hardly any blocks on BCH.
So no price decline yet.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:27:38
Don't you think that ETH has a lot of practical, real world use? I think that's its main advantage.
Love IOTA, that coin might rise steeply in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:08:57
Antpool mined two full blocks in the meantime, and one strange one with 737 KB. 
Maybe they weren't sabotaging after all.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:15:52
Exactly! Best thing that can happen to BTC, all of these institutional investors coming in. And it's only just starting now... Oooooh, this is gonna be nice, nice, nice...
Seems like I was right in not waiting and in buying close to an ATH. Many would have called me crazy, but I just had a gut feeling that I wouldn't see much cheaper prices. Let's see if this holds up.
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:16:33
No, I'm from hell.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:48:56
Either that, or it's just being propped up by its algorithm (that emergency switch, EDA or whatever it's called). The upwards momentum in BTC is incredible, it really would have had to correct more under normal circumstances. But it's showing enormous strength.
A lot of people haven't even separated their BCH from their BTC, and it's very unclear where the BCH price movement exactly comes from. In any case, it doesn't mean that this movement is sustainable. BTC has proven it's strength again and again, and BCH has yet to prove it can survive (I hope not...).
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:02:50
Good answers, make me feel hopeful.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:40:53
I love that quote at the end of the video. He explains why he doesn't move:

@_date: 2017-08-24 23:22:47
Everybody is guessing. Not a person on the planet that isn't. The difference is just that some guesses are more educated than others...
It's always like that. For example, let's say oil goes down. Next day you can read all of the so-called "experts" all over the mainstream media, telling you exactly WHY it went down. They might tell you it happened because the economy is slowing down, so less industrial demand for oil. Funny thing is, next week oil rises, and some will use the very same argument as reason why it went UP (e.g. economy slows down, so investors are shifting away from stocks into commodities).
You can always sell anything as cause for anything, if you know how to do it. Everybody thinks they are smart. So accumulate experience and trust your own judgement!
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:27:46
You will like [this chart](
 It shows the average past daily performance, sorted by year.
It's really super interesting. The only year with negative return was 2014. You can also see the impact of the halvings (last halvings were in November 2012, and in July 2016). It's obvious that the halvings give BTC a huge push.
IMO, 2014 was a negative exception, because it saw the correction of the big 2013/2014 "bubble," and BTC wasn't ready for mass adoption and the steep part of the S-curve yet. So it had to go down again and stay down for a while. But now we definitely started the steep part, and a year like 2014 won't happen again. 
Most interestingly, if it continues to grow like this, by 2020 it will reach $250,000.It's quite astonishing. All hail the logarithmic scale!
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:53:17
Reality is complicated, and economy is a very complex, multi-layered topic. Rather believe people who say they are not sure, than people who claim they know it all...
I'm not talking about ordinary funds. Recently, over 70 funds who want to trade cryptocurrencies exclusively have applied for registration. Also, you see all of these positive comments by institutional investors lately. It all just fits together. They are coming in now! And I'm not sure about the size of these funds, but my guess would be they will be much larger than 1-10m.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:17:55
How would a falling BCH price make things better for BTC?
After a day, BCH difficulty would just go down, and mining would get even faster. It would be back to the same old.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:24:50
He he... Yes!! Yes!! Make more of those kids!!!
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:50:54
True. But even if it works JUST as a commodity, and nothing else, that will be good enough to make it super valuable. If on top of that even just a couple of store accept it, that will be an awesome bonus.
The big argument that speaks against spending your BTC: It's deflationary. That means the option of spending it is very unattractive, because it's practically guaranteed it will be worth more in the future. And that deflationary aspect will never change, so I don't think it can become a full currency.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:16:26
You sound like a sect leader.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:15:02

@_date: 2017-08-26 18:47:38
Thanks, will try.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:22:57
Excellent comment! Sounds... sound.
Let's watch the number of BCH coins. I remember it was LESS coins than BTC when the hard fork happened, I don't remember how many though.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:06:14
It won't even close below $3,000 anymore, probably not below $3,300. It even looks to that it won't go much below $4,000.
It started to behave differently one week ago, pulling back a lot less, with really explosive movements.
Nobody knows what's going to happen. But at this point, it's much more risky to miss upwards movements than the gain you could make from waiting for it to fall a bit.
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:50:56
What if you didn't know how much was on it, if any?
Would you do it then?
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:50:57
The thing is... there is no free lunch!
BCH with its algorithm wants to have its cake and eat it too. It will at some point pay the price (too many coins, hyperinflation, etc...), but that might take a while.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:16:27
Right, thanks.
I don't see the price falling now though.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:52:42
Warren Buffet supposedly still drives his old car. These people don't need the flashy shiny machines for their egos.
Personally, I never understood the appeal of a Porsche. I'm in it for the freedom. When I look at a BTC chart, I see a freedom chart (freedom rising like crazy at the moment). I have too many great ideas in my head that want to get out, too many things to experience to care about Porsches. But to each their own.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:48:23
Looks like I was right. People who listened to me would have made a lot of money.
What we can also learn from this: If a thread is overloaded with fear, it's a very bullish sign.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:49:08
This linked back to this thread.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:54:32
That's EXACTLY it!
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:57:39
Would be cool to also have some place where people who are not that technical, but have been in BTC for a while, can ask questions (that would be me).
I would love to learn more about the technical aspects. I recently bought "Mastering Bitcoin," but it's very hard and often impossible to understand for me.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:24:32
Then "clogged" is also the wrong word for what is currently happening with BTC, because these transactions will eventually go through as well.
But I guess it was a language problem, English is not my first language.
Ok, slow. :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:20:16
It's dropping.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:41:14
Yes, we need scaling solutions, and they are coming, step by step.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:33:55
Hm... yes, yes... *hands over the valium.*
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:03:30
Will do, just to make sure.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:51:10
PS: What can we win?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:51:14
You can do that stuff with any altcoin though. But BCH's big advantage is that it carries the brand name.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:10:14
Yes, they were clearing out the mempool, but what difference does that make for the user, if he still has to wait for an hour for his transaction to go through? Same result as with fast blocks, but your transaction only gets in after an hour. Btw, confirmations you would even have faster in the latter case.
The new algorithm changed that game once again, yes.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:40:43
That was nicely explained, great point!
Still, market cap is a very valuable metric for comparison, e.g. compare one coin to the next one, or compare crypto market cap to stock or real estate market caps, etc... And that's what these numbers are for. Your explanation takes nothing away from that.
Everything you said is also true for stock market caps, bonds market caps, real estate market caps, etc... So there we go, we leveled the playing field again.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:09:56
BCH has the brand though. Not that there is anything behind it, but it has the name the public wants to see.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:28:55
Yes, she told me to say "Hi" to you!
But I meant how often do you mention BTC to her? We are not a cult, dammnit! Ha ha. Actually, BTC users are pretty much the opposite of a cult... many independent thinkers.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:10:04
Yes, I used one. Just put a couple of hundred Euros into it, and received my BTC. No name or data required, up to 750 Euros. But I get that it's a question of where and how.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:22:41
The difference is that technically/legally, the overwhelming majority of houses COULD be sold, the owners just don't want to. And some extreme circumstances might actually get a lot of houses to swamp the market at once.
In the case of BCH though, the holders who have their BCH still on coinbase CAN'T access it. There is just no way on earth they can sell now. Plus there is a ton of people who aren't even aware they own BCH. But there are no house-owners that aren't aware that they own a house...
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:45:25
I meant sell your B2x futures.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:27:00
Probably. In other words, a power struggle. But Core does us a lot more good than the miners, so it's clear where we stand.
NYA was a great thing though, it finally brought us SegWit. People are forgetting that already.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:32:50
Stock market I haven't heard yet. But that will change soon, I think.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:08:49
Can you tell us a bit how you are going about cashing out that much? I'm assuming you will use several exchanges. I would expect some liquidity problems.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:36:33
I just wanted to post the same question. Are you going with a big bag, and then you stuff all those fluttering bank notes into it?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:45:41
Thanks! See comment above.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:28:02
Sail away, my friend!
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:52:03
Got it.
Let's wait for the stock market tumbling then... but it's a 70 trillion beast, so that might take a while.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:48:17
We will never see $3,000 again, those days are gone (unless BTC dies).
Maybe you are right. If you are wrong, you will have to buy in at A LOT higher prices.

Jesus Christ, why don't they ask for your first-born right away?

Ok, I might do that.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:44:30
Bitcoins deflationary nature is a great incentive for them to hold long-term.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:51:46
I don't get that, is it based on some Oprah quote I'm not familiar with?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:29
We might have a lot of time actually. Look at BCH, it's still trading relatively high.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:43:46
It's not always taxes, it's often mandatory insurance. And that's not a bad model.
In my country, we do have an excellent healthcare system, and everybody is taken care of. But the burdens of tax and mandatory insurance, on people who earn well is just terrible. You are basically getting punished for working.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:39:37

Ha ha! It's copy and paste of older material though, the 0.14 version. Maybe it's some kind of retro attempt, like you would buy an old Cadillac or a newspaper from the date of your birth.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:57:42
Some people here say she shouldn't talk to you like that, but that was not my first thought. BECAUSE I was assuming that to get such a reaction, you must have talked to her A LOT about Bitcoin.
Like A LOT.
Like A FUCKTON.
I know these situations... sigh... And I understand. At some point your partner is just getting tired of constantly hearing about Bitcoin. I mean, most of us are obsessed with this, checking the price 800 times per day (obsessed for good reasons, but still obsessed...exciting times...).
Imagine having to listen day-in, day-out to your gf or wife about a topic you absolutely don't give a shit about: Nailpolish. The latest season of "Keeping up with the Kardashians" (please keep up with them!). Show jumping. And sometimes smart people like dumb stuff too.
At some point it just gets too much.
I switch between phases in which I talk a lot about it to my gf, and phases in which I take myself back almost completely. Which is easier when the price isn't rising like crazy. Live and let live. And sometimes, I can get her excited too.
Most girls are just not interested in Bitcoin, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:29:27
When the critical point is reached, many more people will think like that. But that's a couple of years in the future, when people trust BTC more, and it's not that "strange and risky asset" anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:00:19
A ha ha ha, that's so funny. I have actually never seen a minute of that show. I just imagine it to be the pinnacle of cheesiness.
Glad you are keeping up with the Kardashians!
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:40:55
Lol, it's not that fast. Give the network time to get usable again.
The number of mempool transactions [is already going down](  (it was at 175 000 already, half an hour ago).
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:59:28
Can somebody tell me how I can use SegWit transactions on Coinomi, Jaxx or on my Ledger S?
Would love to switch, but I don't have a clue what I need to do. Any link or explanation would be highly appreciated.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:31:12
It might make sense to "split" your coins on Bitfinex now and sell already. This ship will go down fast.
Edit: I mean selling your B2x futures. THAT ship will go down fast...
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:09:35
Ok, but this DOES sound like an attack. Is that major disruption of the network really worth it?
And by the way, it's such a silly idea to want to get rid of Core when they have done nothing but an excellent job all around. The best developers in the world, lots of them, and you want to get rid of them?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:17:41
Hi Pieter! Awesome to get that request answered by you personally, thank you. And thanks for your great contributions to Bitcoin!
As you are reading this, I'm gonna try my luck and hope you will be kind enough to answer: How much of a threat is the SegWit2x hardfork really, in your opinion? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:25:31
It could now go much higher before it corrects.
The market always wants to trick you. And everybody on this sub seems to await a correction at this moment... too much consensus.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:34:14
Yes, I remember that info.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:49:15
I have no idea. It doesn't seem that low, btw. But I'm just waiting until they have cleared the mempool and the blockchain starts moving again. Can anyone calculate or estimate how long that will take?
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:26:50
Sounds reasonable, but why do you think that? Any sources?
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:36:43
Ok, it does.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:11:51
Ha ha, fair enough!
I don't day trade, btw, I just watch patterns on a bigger scale, it helps when buying new coins.

Not really, but he is a legend, and for sure him and silent movies 
were perceived differently during his time.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:56:11
It doesn't just have to draw from currency!
Look at the stock market for example, 70 trillions right now. If 10% of that goes into crypto (and half of it into BTC), we go to $250,000 or so per coin.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:45:07
I see. I'm hoping to find some way to split them myself, and will then only transfer my B2x to HitBTC. Kind of thinking like you, I definitely want to sell some of them soon (especially if the price stays like that), but not all of them.
You can never be sure though (unless you see them trading at 13 cents, but then you won't get much for selling them anymore anyways, so you might as well keep them). But yeah, you can wait till risk significantly decreases. Seems like B2x hardly has a chance to succeed though.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:23:33
Will that be enough though? Segwit about doubles the size, if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:23:29
10%, I guess you would just spend it if there was no crypto. Correct?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:30:48
I somehow never found him funny. Never got a laugh out of me in my life.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:19:11
That's interesting. I would have thought world-class developers are extremely scarce, while everybody with some entrepreneurial spirit can start to mine (and grow from there). And certainly everybody who has money can start to mine.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:26:39
Will you sell all of your B2x coins as soon as you can?
Also, HitBTC offers an excellent price for your B2x coins, if you want to sell them. Why not trade there?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:22:40
Blocksize increases won't solve the issue either, unless you are cool with it becoming complete centralized.
Doesn't sound too good to me...

@_date: 2017-11-12 19:58:00
You can never know for sure anything in trading...
The most important thing is to separate your thoughts from your emotions. You can do that by setting firm conditions for yourself upfront, and then sticking to them, no matter what.
For example: I'm going to buy now, and then I'm going to hold except for if it drops below $6,500.
Then, you do not sell under any circumstances (unless it drops below $6,500).
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:49:17
Bingo! That's exactly it. Plus, BTC has by far the best developer team and by far the best brand/network effect.
That's not to say there is no altcoin that has any value though. Some of them might have a point, and Ethereum, as unstable and inflationary as it is, pushes the boundaries in development.
However, none of these alts even come close to BTC after Segwit implementation.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:22:31
What would that salary have gone into if BTC didn't exist? Would you have just spent it or invested in sth else?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:00:06
I'm actually doing it right now, I found out how it works on Bitfinex yesterday. I'm only putting a small part of my BTC there, because I don't feel that comfortable with leaving them at Bitfinex. PM me if you want to jump into this together!

Once they re-buy, they obviously drive the price up again. And you have to time these moves really well, some wales got burned badly in the process and lost all of their playing money.

Kudos for doing that! Exactly the right move. But doesn't help for this little survey here.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:36:08
Yes, but that precisely means that outside value has flown into cryptos. In other words: Somebody has to buy that shit. And I'm really wondering who that is. It just doesn't make sense. Especially as when you are a BTC holder at the time of the split, you already have the forked coin anyways.
And who in their right mind would buy the altcoin AFTER the fork instead of BTC BEFORE the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:19:19
You are pretty much describing Dash. I hope BTC succeeds, but if it doesn't, I'm betting on Dash. It's superior to BCH in all regards.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:42:29
PS: There may be one exception to this: If many of the coins are not available on the market, like it is with BCH. That coin has more of a fake market cap.

Asked from a non-developer to a developer: Would you agree that Core is extremely good? I'm genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:52:32
I see.


I thought so as well. 
And they are not a small team, they are 400 people in a lot of different projects. The fact that the Core team itself changes from time to time, and the observation that they seem to have the well-being of BTC as their goal, is good enough for me (in regards to decentralization). 
I mean, somebody has to be in charge of a project, otherwise it's just chaos. BTC is really as decentralized as such a huge, functioning project gets.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:46:08
Do you have numbers? How much BCH is bound by Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:47:03
Then why are we at huge volumes, yet the price isn't going down?
I mean, my transaction has been stuck for a day now, but sure SOMEBODY must be trading, right?
[Look at the volume bars below the chart.](
We will see if I'm right or wrong, I just thought it would be fun to put a prediction out there. Lots of fear here... and this is why you should buy.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:20:33
Thank you very much. But to use my Ledger SegWit address, I have to send TO a Segwit address, correct? And how do I do that, if I have my funds on paper wallets for example, or if I want to send to an exchange that doesn't give me a SegWit address for deposit?

Do you think that could happen do BTC too, at some point down the line? I'm asking because I see these future markets opening, etc..., and I don't know what to think about it. Is it good or bad...?

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:41:14
That's true. Also, some dangers are almost out of the way, like a concentrated effort of governments banning it, or altcoins catching up (as far as I'm concerned).
Last June I said it was the ideal time to enter now, from a risk/potential reward point of view. And I still stand by that.

Well, 30% isn't nothing. But you are right, in terms of percentage losses, there isn't that much blood to be seen. But in terms of FEAR.... a lot of blood! Those last two days were very, very scary, the network is unusable, BTC was overdue for a big correction anyways, etc...
And even under these terrible conditions, we are only losing 30% of an overbought market! That's a very good sign to me.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:52:04
Exactly, excellent points!

Premined: That was accidentally, and Evan (founder) has been transparent about his holdings and plans to give away 80% of these coins for the Dash project.

Honest question: How can LN solve scalability if you always need to open a channel on the first layer first? Seems to me like that will reduce the load of txs, but it won't be enough.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:57:16
True for the moment. However, this will shift. Once people get used to BTC, they will use it a bit more as a currency.

I totally agree with what you said about centralization.
But how can LN help longterm, if you have to open a new channel on the blockchain itself first, before you can interact over LN with somebody? If fees are sky high, nobody wants to open that channel in the first place.

With many people I have to ask myself if they have bad intentions or if they are just dumb. The answer is often not an easy one. 
Here is a slight variation of that question: Why do most governments not really care to outlaw Bitcoin? Is it that they have genuinely good intentions, or is it that they are just too dumb to see what Bitcoin can do to them? Or do they have good intentions AND are smart enough to see that they can't win this fight?
It's often difficult to tell...

Well, at this point 90% would be something to seriously think about. It really shouldn't crash to below pre-Segwit adoption levels anymore, that would just not make sense at all.
But when it's 90% down, selling isn't worth it anymore anyways. So yeah... I would probably just buy more too.

Awwww, that's sweet!
I thought about doing the same thing for my nephews, but came to the conclusions that:
1. Even if BTC is super successful over the next decade, who knows if it still exists 18 years from now.
2. If BTC fails, they won't be impressed when they receive it in 15-18 years: "Ewww, uncle bought me some stuff 15 years ago that's worthless now. Thank you so much!"
3. If BTC is worth 50 or 100 times or whatever by then, they will appreciate it much more if they get that amount at that point in time. I'm just keeping them in the meantime.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:13:59
Ha ha, that clip is GOLD! That's exactly what it sounds like when the mainstream media or aunt Polly struggle to grasp what is Bitcoin.
I will tell you the big difference in regards to adoption though: Crypto adoption is driven by greed. That's why it will go lightning fast, much faster than the internet. The next couple of years will be the steep part of the S-curve, and the investment opportunity of our lifetimes.

Well, a severe correction will come sooner or later. And from the bottom of that correction, at some point we will pick up speed again. The result will be one of those characteristic "bumps" in the chart; growth-and-bust-cycles. Once you have gone through a couple of them, you relax (as a long-term investor).
However, we just entered the steep part of the S-curve. The rise it will make over the next couple of years will be far outside of many people's reality.
$100,000 within 5 years, after the next halving. That's a conservative prediction.

But won't it be lower when it's at $80,000 as well? And that could take a couple of years...
I thought about keeping a small stash of BTC for spending purposes, once enough merchants accept it. I will just buy for 1,000€ or whatever, and whenever BTC is higher than it was at the time I bought that stash, I will spend it. Then refill, once it's used up.
That way not only will I be spending in BTC, but I will also get things a little bit cheaper.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:56:34
Yeah, it's hardly a dip so far. But if it goes below $4,500 for an extended period of time, I would at least call it a small dip.

Our bitcoin on nodes, hallowed be thy name. Your transactions will be done, on the blockchain as well as on our computers. Give us this day our daily rise.

That sounds like some passive-aggressive threat. 
Bitcoin is attractive to hackers, not to street thugs.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:29:43
Even then, IMO the dip, if it really went below $3,000, would be very, very short-lived. I could see $2,000 for a couple of days, if something catastrophic happened.
The upwards push is just too strong at the moment, there are hardly any pullbacks even. It has reached the steep part of the S-Curve and will at least double every year from now on (and multiply after the next halving).
And I can't agree on 2008, that crash was very much fundamentally driven (and in the end also psychologically, of course, like every single crash ever).

@_date: 2017-09-02 13:03:27
Ha ha. What's that Kim image doing on all of their threads?
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:36:19
Yes, that's interesting. Tell us more!
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:49:12
You are very welcome. Stay strong during the downswings!
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:03:32
Search the address that you think contains your BCH. You will have certainty then if there is some BCH on it or not.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:28:09
I heard Davorcoin is really good.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:15:43
Awesome, all the best for your company!

Look at Charlie's Tweets again; he mentions this in a follow up tweet.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:24:17
Totally this.
But I can understand OP very well.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:34:14
Without replay protection, no exchange will feature the 2x coin. They would open themselves to all kinds of lawsuits. Without replay protection, that coin will be no issue.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:59:30
I see what you are saying. On the other hand, where is the line between an attack and just a normal fork?
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:09:39
You have to think in terms of risk/reward ratio. In hindsight, everybody is smarter.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:38:25
Yes, I see. We will figure it out.
You are online here non-stop, it seems, ha ha! But I can see it with myself, it's hard to resist this forum. :D I was at bitcointalks earlier, but the quality of that place really has gone down the drain.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:56:44
Ah, yes, so just one little bitcoiny.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:49:30
That's so cool! :) So what are you doing with all of that free time, how do you spend your life, if I may ask?
At what point did you realize how much BTC would appreciate and took that decision to live off it?
Would be really interested to hear about your experiences.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:29:45
Yes, that's kind of my evolution too. BTC is still 5 levels above any alt, and the market will get back to this evaluation sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:14:46
Good testbed... yum-yum! He he.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:13:56
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:43:57
With that domain name, I thought you were just being silly first...
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:55:40
Right. And 2x coin won't have that EDA mechanism that kept BCH afloat for a while.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:15:14
Right now, it's:
30 Day Volume:  29.9807 BTC;
24 Hour Volume:  13.8245 BTC
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:48:43
Why should 2x win just because it can mine 100 blocks?
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:43:15
Me too, total junkie. Only exception: When price goes down. I try to forget it then, because it makes me feel bad, so why bother? It's actually a relieve then, like a curse taken off me.
Then it goes up again, and I continue to observe price and be excited...
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:49:23
Why is it still number 3 though?
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:33:11
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:49:54
So they put the bitcoins into a package and send them to you, with a pink ribbon around each one?
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:14:00
If you control your private key, then you will probably soon have a lot of coins: One Bitcoin, one Bitcoin Cash, one Bitcoin Gold, one B2x Coin, one Bitcoin Unlimited, one Bitcoin Advanced 2.0 ECC, one Bitcoin Extreme Blocksize Edition, one Bitcoin Emergent Consensus Token, one Authentic Bitcoin, one WrightCoin, one VerCash, one Satoken, and one Bitcoin 2 Extreme Turbo Edition.
(Stole this from u/paperraincoat.)
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:23:45
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:16:26
I highly doubt that their short-term revenue is more important to them than their reputation.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:24:51
Yes, you don't know. But since we all believe that BTC is going moonwards, it's much better to buy too early than too late.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:50:55
Yeah, they have to go through this. There is just no way around it. It's like a humiliating initiation ritual in college or something.
"But in the old times... you don't know how hard it was in the old times, son! Ever bought, then saw it go down by 60%, and stay there for two years? Ever done that? You ain't seen nuthin', son!" *Spits chewing tobacco on floor*
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:17:18
Ha ha. Subtle difference. Watch out, muggers!
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:09:17
I hope it's just incompetence, because some of it smells like a purposeful scam.
Anyways, I will sell that shit as soon as I can. I'm starting to dig these forks, they are really free additional Bitcoin. :D
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:54:40
That's the right way to look at it.
If you believe in BTC long-term, and you are in it for the mighty HODL, then highs are great because you win value, and lows are great because you can buy more. Either way you win.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:57:47
Then you didn't contradict me. I don't care when and how much it crashes, as long as it comes up again in the end. Maybe it will crash in November. My personal guess is it won't, but it might.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:50:51
You held these BTC with your private keys on August 1st?
Check the BCH blockchain for your address:
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:27:06
Ok, that's the information I had, maybe I'm wrong. I'm not a very technical person and can't tell you details, but that's what I was told from a trustworthy source (Trace Meyer interview).
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:29:10
For sure, the priority must be that our coins are safe.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:35:40
Sounds great!! But maybe you guys should have a working website and more than 83 twitter followers before you go public.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:47:04
Exactly! Ha ha... Can you imagine, every new block only rewarded with 3.12 BTC? Now 20 year olds having their own/more income? Now 12 year olds for whom BTC will be as natural as cell phones are for us now? That 200-billion-newly-printed-per-week fiat bubble blown up even more?
I guarantee, if BTC still exists in 2025, if will be worth a fortune. Way, way beyond $100k. 
But I will have sold most of mine by then and be retired.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:05:31
So Trezor and Ledger are not affected?
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:45:11
Never heard of them, I will check them out.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:34:06
That wouldn't matter. He would just have to pay her the equivalent in fiat. And that would effectively be the same as paying her in bitcoin, and then spending fiat on buying new bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:59:15
Amazing. Bye bye, Ether!
Seems they are Argentinian. Does anybody have more info about that company?
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:05:24
Women are more risk averse, it's just their nature. They are more the nurturing stabilizing part of humanity, while the male part is the exploring and pushing forward one.
Women will come in once BTC is better accepted in society and has lost its stigma of "that crazy risky unknown internet thing."
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:11:13
Excellent comment! Schiff is super smart, so his position on BTC is a big disappointment.
I guess once it reaches $100,000, he will say: "Will it crash tomorrow? I don't know, it could go up to $300,000, who knows. All I know is that this will not end well."
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:46:13
It's all relative. Once you are 45, the age of 50 will not seem old to you anymore...
He also has some advantages: He can hopefully throw a lot more money at BTC than a 16 year old. Plus, ideally, a couple of decades of experience with investing.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:52:50
I just googled that, and it beamed me back into the 80ies.
But how is that related to a dream?
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:17:06
What happened?
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:12:11
The halving's effects are felt only half a year to a year after the halving. So that would be sold too early...
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:15:14
Maybe it was just a dream.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:57:10
For phones, I'm not sure if they have a desktop version. Just google it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:22:57
That one doesn't sound as fun though. In German you would say "Baumschule," which includes the word "school." It's perfect.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:00:01
Yeah, downvoting a question like yours is not cool.
Just take a look at the market cap. BTC is at 100 billion right now. Compare to e.g. gold (7 trillion), or stocks (70 trillion), or offshore money (around 15-30 trillion).
1 trillion is 1,000 billions. Now do the math: What happens if just 10% of gold (700 billions) goes into BTC? That alone would make the price rise x 7 and get it to $42,000. Take other asset classes and calculate.
If BTC survives, $100,000 is still low.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:10:06
Ledger is just saying they can do it even without replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:13:24
People not trusting you, but your reputation not suffering from it? I would be curious to know how that works.
Core never agreed to NYA, true. I wasn't talking about Core, I was talking about the miners and businesses that signed NYA.
Without NYA, you probably wouldn't enjoy Segwit now. So be glad it happened. It was possible because of trust (miners opted in, trusting that they in turn would get 2x later).
Because banks screw people, it is okay to screw people? Strange deduction. This has nothing to do with banks and government.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:03:19
Yup. Only one main developer working on this.
Sell, sell, sell as soon as you can.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:39:34
Some altcoins can do some nice little things, but none of them are a true revolution. Just some additional nice stuff.
In turn, BTC has soooooo many advantages over altcoins; and now Segwit is implemented, there are a lot more to come. And I'm not even speaking of the side chains that are now possible with BTC - you can program a lot on them, and should something go wrong, you just set these coins back to 0 and bring them onto the main chain again.
And those are just the technical aspects alone. Don't even get me started on the networking effect or on BTC's world class developer team.
Also, don't forget that the alts are lifting very light weight. None of them (except for centralized ETH maybe) even remotely has encountered BTC's scaling issues. Should they become bigger, they will have a whole new set of problems in front of them.
The one exception is IOTA, it's very promising for the reasons you mentioned (and other reasons). That coin could skyrocket, once it's featured on more exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:11:39
I just don't get how that works without replay protection. Maybe they put up their own mechanisms internally.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:22:19
Bitcoin will make the world healthy...!
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:14:47
Bitcoin Gold will have replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:02:14
Yes, I agree. $100,000 in 4 years or so max. Hopefully hyperinflation will not have caught up with us by then...
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:51:15
I don't get your comment.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:37:15
That's pretty much what I said... But this case is different...
Hard to grasp for many people. A concept like Bitcoin and what it implies is far outside of the reality of the average person.
Don't get me wrong, it could absolutely still go to zero. But that would not be because of this growth rate, that statement is ridiculous if you have followed the graph for a couple of years.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:47:59
And what's that place with the 72 virgins?

These General Bytes machines go for $3,000/$7,000:
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:29:00
I also don't get the difference. I mean, I know what mining is. But a node does the transactions, and miners confirm the transactions, or what? Why are people who run nodes not rewarded, unlike miners? What happens if there are not enough nodes? Questions upon questions...
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:43:34
What abuse? Just dumping a large amount of BTC at once is not abuse. Once you have dumped it, it's gone. Long-term, you can hardly influence the markets with this, if the asset has true value.
I'm sceptical about that futures thing too.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:08:20
Ok, I'm not sure how that works now. I swept mine from paper wallets after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:27:01
If 2x doesn't come with replay protection, no exchange will feature it. Exchanges would expose themselves to all kinds of potential lawsuits.
If it doesn't feature replay protection, the much the better. It will be dead in the water.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:33:26

@_date: 2017-10-26 00:56:16
By that logic, BTC would have to never ever rise again (or only as much as BCG falls, as a maximum). But it will rise again, and BCG will also be worth a bit.
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:53:45
Nice! But isn't a new Trezor version coming out before the end of the year?
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:17:13
I disagree. We are in the steep part of the S-curve now, fasten your seatbelt!
You can see this with the price recovering right now, I'm assuming to new ATHs. IF we followed the old pattern, we would go into a bearish phase right now.

At this point, you have to buy just to save your sanity in the future. Even if it goes to zero, doesn't matter, buying now is the right choice for you.

@_date: 2017-10-12 14:53:34
Yes, it means one of those two things always.
In Lagarde's case, she means the latter. In other words, she think she will be able to buy it at $2,000 or $1,000, or whatever at some point in the future. She is wrong, and she will have to buy in with a bunch of other newbies at $10,000. Or $50,000.

You might get much lower price for them if you wait too long. I think people have learned from the BCH split and will dump this one quicker (they also learned that holding during the fork is a good thing, because they get both coins).
Just put tiny amounts on a couple of paper wallets now, so you can use them as test beds after the split and see with your own eyes that it goes well.
My Ledger S should arrive in a couple of days, can't wait!

It's not fun to sound like an idiot... if you do it publicly.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:14:40
Of course it's imperative they get women hooked too. But I'm telling you, they will come, once BTC is not seen anymore as strange little geek pet peeve with extreme risk and volatility.
Oh yes, the working class... They will come too, but they will come when there is not much to gain anymore in price rises.
PS: What was first, the chicken or the egg? Ha ha...
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:55:03
Logarithmic scale, that's all.
Why does BTC add $10 so much quicker to its price now than it did when it was worth $20? Because the price grows in percentages, not in absolute numbers.
Wrong question to ask now: How long will it take for it to rise by $6,000? 
Right question to ask now: How long will it take to double again?
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:56:37
Which ones do you like?
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:49:25
To raise the reputation of those pathetic 2x coins.

He he...
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:46:45
And what about Core?? BTC has 400 of the world's best developers on its side, the A-Team. They will bring so many mindblowing innovations to BTC over the next couple of months/years... if we let them. They are the real asset of BTC, the asset that makes it far superior to any altcoin. To lose Core would be a huge blow, and you can expect for your coins to be worth a lot less within the next years if they leave (compared to what your coins would have been worth if Core had stayed).
But yes, I also like the prospect of some people keeping their word. NYA brought us SegWit, after all.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:29:06
You sound like somebody with little life experience.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:42:03
Ha, that's great! Did you get a lot of shit from your parents for investing? Or maybe you didn't tell them...
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:04:52
Yup. 2-3 years.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:08:55
I will be careful, thank you.
I think they will install replay protection before the coin can be traded though, on Nov 1st. And Coinomi will support BitcoinGold, that's great. I split and sold most of my BCH with Coinomi. It was very easy to do.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:45:25
Well, to me it's a 0 or 1 game. It will go to the moon, unless something terrible happens. So there is still that risk. Risk is not more than 10% though IMO, maybe 20% at the most.
And on top of that, you should never do any investment that carries risk with a loan.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:03:44
Yup. Amazon accepting it would be huge. Would also mean a couple more headlines. Would also mean other shops have to follow suit.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:02:30
Nice, keep on hodling. This thing will go to $100,000 easily. But I don't think I have to tell you. 16 million dollars for you. Yay!

What did she do?
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:19:20
Thanks! In the meantime, I also read some comment by Greg Maxwell in some other thread, where he says that would be an emergency option at some point, but he doesn't see the necessity now (from what I can remember that's what he says).

You are three months old?
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:03:48
This is indeed a very conservative estimate. I would say $100,000 within 5 years, and that's still a little bit on the conservative side. Just watch what will happen after the next halving...
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:42:42

The mass can't resist mass adoption. So to speak...
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:19:47
Ha, that's great! Sounds a bit expensive though, I guess people would rather buy a hardware wallet for that money.
But what do I know. If it works to charge that much, do it!
Maybe you could hide the colorful wire somehow (just some feedback).
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:30:51
I completely agree with you, OP, this is huge news! It means that the established, powerful monetary institutions will probably not put anything in the way of BTC. Great!
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:18:34
Damn, what you doing here in this tiny old thread?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:52:59
Ok, so let's wait till the beginning of next year and see which one of us is right. You are saying it will crash and not recover anymore, right?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:53:58
LOL, those comments are truly hillarious...!
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:41:02
This is my take on it:
By now, we have seen enough years on the BTC timeline for a rough pattern to emerge. The halvings are important and give BTC a big boost every 4 years. Other than that, [look at the average gains so far.] ( 2014 was the only year that was highly atypical (the only one that came with a loss for BTC investors).
It's also very important to remember that BTC grows on a LOGARITHMIC scale, and not on a linear one (network effect). In other words:
Wrong question to ask now: How long will it take for it to rise by $6,000?
Right question to ask now: How long will it take to double again?
Taking into account all if this, IF Bitcoin prevails, here is my prediction:
$15,000 till the end of 2018.
$30,000 till the end of 2019.
$60,000 till the end of 2020.
At least $100,000 till the end of 2021 (and possibly much more).
Those are conservative predictions, it could go much higher. As you can see, the average past gains give it $250,000 by 2020.
Or it could go to 0.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:06:02
He he, gotta love the nerds! That project is exciting. It actually seems to be several different sidechain projects.
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:05:43
That's like not paying for your sandwich, and after the fact saying "I was only in it for the part in which you gave me the sandwich. I wasn't in it for the forking over money part."
NYA is Segwit2x. And Segwit2x consists of Segwit (done in July/August), and of 2x (to be done in November).

Dinosaur. Might be too old to get it, and has certainly not made himself very familiar with BTC. Like most critics.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:54:32
Ether is well known for its possibilities of creating smart contracts. That's one of the main reasons it was hyped so much.
Now you can program smart contracts in BTC too, in its sidechains. Plus you can program a lot of other things into a BTC sidechain, and if it doesn't work, you can just bring the coins back into the main chain. So now (since SegWit adoption), BTC has many of ETH's possibilities, while it lacks many of ETH's risks. 
Thus I called it the "better Ether."

Yes, source please. And what hardfork, what would be new?
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:42:18
Originally, I saw three main dangers:
1. BTC banned by governments
2. Technical difficulties
3. Alts overtaking BTC
For various reasons, none of these are a big danger anymore IMO. Biggest danger now are political/technical fights within BTC (forks, etc...). All in all, it can go to 0, but the likeliness of that happening is far overrated in the public eye. Also, as BTC grows, it gets less and less likely for it to go towards 0.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:46:49
It's ok. As far as I can see, nobody is reading this. Ha ha.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:13:07
Yes, too bad. Poor dude!
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:14:19
This. It's gonna be nice.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:40:15
I will give it one more year than you. I predict $100k by the end of 2021 (latest). Because by then, the next halving will have fully taken effect.
However, that prediction is on the conservative side. I hate to be wrong just as much as you. ;)
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:35:34
Ha ha, it's nothing personal...
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:38:34
Nice. Although it's too bad that trust will be lost; people not keeping their promises. But at this point, it's safer to go back. If 2x dies, that will be a huge boost for BTC.
Can anybody tell me what percentage of miner-drop-out would effectively kill the hard fork? And why?
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:04:48
I hope not either. Doesn't look good for them so far.

Great, I will be observing this like a hawk.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:27:25
That would have made sense, but it's not the case.
It's crazy, but this stuff is literally free money. I'm still not sure how this works. But apparently some poor soul is buying this shit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:59:21
Good observation. A 4-year cycle also makes a lot of sense for BTC, because of the halvings every 4 years (which drive the price significantly).
Still, I don't see the pattern from 4 years ago repeating. Maybe this year will be slower than 2017 and 2019/2020, then we would have both: The cycle is honored, but the S-curve (steep curve of adoption) too.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:59:26
It didn't fork today - it already forked a while ago (its developers still keep it a secret when this creature was born). It was pre-mined and sold as in an ICO, so the devolpers could grab more cash.
Funny thing that the market (kind of) acts as if the hardfork was today. Shows how much misinformation and confusion is out there.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:02:03

Great stuff, thanks for the work!
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:15:57
A bit off topic: I'm on the fence whether to buy a Trezor or a Ledger S. I know they are both good. BUT:
1. I recently heard that Trezor had some security vulnerability exposed (with its recovery seed, I believe). What happened there, and is this a danger for the future?
2. Once my device arrives, I want to test the recovery seed (pretend I lost my device, and use the recovery seed to recover my wallet). As I understand, if I do this with the Ledger, the seed and thus my device will be worthless afterwards; whereas with the Trezor this is possible without problems. Correct?
Any hints of knowledgeable people would make me a happy hodler!
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:15:25
Ha ha. You have a solution for everything.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:47:32
2017 did nothing...?
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:31:06
Under normal circumstances that rise together with people being so bullish would be an EXTREMELY bearish sign. I would sell my stocks and run for the hills!
This case is different however, because we are dealing with a new technology, the network effect and the S-Curve.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:50:21
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:05:38
Doesn't mean they are resorting to government to solve their problems. The legal threat is just one additional, serious threat to put more pressure on these guys. If you do something illegal and you get caught, you will have to pay for it.
Beyond that, yes, BTC has to prove it can survive this bullshit on its own.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:25:23
That malicious intention should be enough for every BTC supporter NOT to support Coinbase in any way. Spread the word!
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:15:12
That's silly.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:03:32
If I wasn't busy getting all the BTC I can possibly lay my hands on, then LTC and IOTA would be interesting too, maybe Dash.
Oh, and I'm thinking of putting a very small amount into BCC. It looks like a ponzi, but why not ride that wave a bit?
But yeah, alts have nothing on BTC, especially after Segwit with sidechains, etc... And you have 400 of the world's best developers working on BTC, no alt can ever come close to that. And don't even get me started on the network effect.
What can Vertcoin do?
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:58:17
Just because it's BNB doesn't mean he stored it on Binance. BNB is an ERC 20 token, so he might also have stored it on My Ether Wallet for example (with a Nano Ledger).
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:23:17
I didn't say that.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:00:55
"In the middle of the block there’s an alley leading north," how is that to be understood...?
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:27:49
Cool, that's very interesting. Thank you! Can we see the fees to go short anywhere?
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:00:49
You always move Bitcoin FIRST, and then the shitcoin second.
That way at least your BTC is safe, as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:10:27
Ah, interesting.

Yup. A bit naive of him.
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:11:42
Awesome! The way you thought and think about BTC, I can see some similarities to myself. It just seemed too good to be true at first... but now I believe that it can, and probably will happen (I bought in 2013). 
I do have a minimum target of $200k. Especially when I look at all the asset classes BTC can draw from: Gold, remittances, offshore wealth, savings, and a 70 trillion stock market. I mean, if just 2% of the stock market, and nothing else, goes into BTC, it goes to $90k. And don't even get me started about those sweet, sweet halvings...
Question: What do you think are the biggest dangers for BTC, what's to watch?
Enjoy your well deserved time with your children!

Question: Can anybody tell me how I can get a receipt/bill on Kraken? I need one with my name and the exact transaction on it, for tax purposes.
I went to "History," but all you can download there is some Excel list. And under "trade" you get the trade, but my name is not on it, and it's not an orderly PDF.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:25:02
Most of these coins were just a joke.
Come to think of it, all of them are a joke...
But you can e.g. easily split your BCC and change it into BTC with Coinomi (app).
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:59:00
It went up from 5650-5950 within a very short period of time. 
Now it gets interesting: Will it break through 6000 for another massive leap towards the mid-6000 range? Or will it bounce back one more time and take another go later?
To be continued...
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:07:18
Yes. And going crazy every 6-12 month after every halving.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:27:51
Just keep your investing funds and your spending funds separately; easy as that.
I mean, eventually you will have to spend SOME of your money to live, right? "Oh no, I bought stuff to eat in 2012, that was sooooo stupid! Should have invested in BTC instead!"
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:54:09
Ha ha, that's awesome! It does have such a lightness to it, it's EXACTLY how I feel when Bitcoin rises by $1,000.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:30:24
True. Short term doesn't interest me too much though.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:40:11
It's ridiculous. But I wonder why somebody promises to do something in the first place if he knows he won't be able to keep it.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:55:44
Yes, I like that view. Also brings us back to the sidechain discussion we were having in that other thread.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:32:31


The stock market is through the roof BECAUSE of inflation (and some manipulation for good measure).


Yes, this makes for a really nice housing bubble.

By that time, they will PAY you to hold BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:58:21
Good. :) Baby steps.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:38:39
Ha ha.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:50:20
When will it go down hard, roughly?
Because what is in 100 years nobody knows. We won't even be alive anymore to see who is right. So give me some time frame.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:03:09
Are you asking me?
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:08:27
Of course nobody knows, BUT:
Technically, after it (clearly) breaks through an all-time high, it will go up for a while. If the pattern we saw the last two times repeats (breaking through ATH around $1,200, and breaking through ATH at $3,000), then this would be a good time to buy.
I would buy with at least half of the money you have at hand, maybe even with the entire sum. Time will tell if I was right.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:42:19
Download Coinomi, it makes it super easy to split your coins.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:47:44
Paper wallet aficionado here.
You are right, but don't forget to mention that you have to create the paper wallet the right way: Triple check your PC for viruses first, print your wallets offline, never re-use an address once you spend something from it, etc...
My Ledger Nano S just arrived. I want to make myself familiar with this, can't wait to unpack it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:29:57
I certainly hope so. Unless the race is called off...
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:01:23
We are not fearing corrections, as long as they at some point are followed by a new ATH (even if it takes years). Nobody is denying corrections, that would be foolish.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:31:35
when moon?
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:23:13
Plus that will be around the year 2100. Everybody reading this now will be dust by then.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:56:18
Sounds great! I want to get rid of these coins as fast as possible.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:17:35
Can't agree about Ether with you (although I own a bit too), but fair enough. :)
I love discussion with all the smart people here as well, and I'm learning a lot every time.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:05:54
No, it doesn't. I'm talking about new ATHs, that's a recovery.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:14:13
Just to be clear: Is that... 1 BTC... or 1,000...?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:06:00
I often guessed right in the past, but now I have no idea where it goes short-term. I just know that after that B2x shit is resolved successfully, we will see a major surge up into the new year.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:02:18
I was exaggerating to make a point. Yes, sidechain, but if it works well and there is more demand, I'm sure we will see more and bigger sidechains doing the same thing.
Also, as it's just a sidechain, there is no risk involved - while there are tons of insecurities and risks with Ether. The BTC ecosystem just seems so much more stable to me.
And if you ask me, Ether was RIDICULOUSLY overpriced when it was at $400 (in relation to BTC). BTC is the better Ether...
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:43:52
I have heard about Vertcoin. They want to decentralize mining with GPUs, right? What else is special about that coin?
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:56:33
Damn, that sucks!
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:06:44


Most people are on the network for their personal gain, like with everything else in the world; be it for investment, or a cheap transaction, or whatever. That's why Satoshi made sure miners can reap rewards, so they are motivated. 
I guess you could say that in the long run people who use BTC also have an interest to help the network at some point though.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:48:37
You would sell. For toys.
As you can see, experience has its advantages...
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:06:25
Yes it is. A Nigerian prince built it.
(That was a joke. Yes, it's well known and reputable.)
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:01:24
Yeah, risk vs. reward. Oh, ok, maybe I wasn't specific enough: It depends on the size of the loan. If it's a small loan, and all you would have to do was, "work a little harder" (for what time frame?), and you are okay with that, then yes, do it!!
I'm just saying taking out a half a million dollar loan that would put the average guy into misery for the rest of his life is not such a good idea. 
Risk vs reward is insanely good with BTC. The public opinion vastly overrates the risk and underrates the reward, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:04:07
Damn me. I shouldn't have. It was DOA. Ha ha

Exactly! How much does he have, 25,000? Still, 1,000 BTC will reduce his stack a little bit.
A dream deal for Charlie and the other 3 guys. I would do that deal any time; we will probably be getting much less for that 2x garbage.
Or maybe Roger is just doing this because he thinks 100 blocks are unlikely...?

Yes. Most uni profs of economics couldn't win a flower pot on the free market. That's why they are at uni; or else they would be retired with 10 millions gained in stocks.
They can paint awesome graphs on whiteboards though.
PS: Christine Legarde said she hadn't bought BTC because it was "too expensive" at the moment. That was when BTC was around $4,500 I believe. Her statement made me laugh. We will see who is right on that one.
AndtThat's the head of the IMF. Those are the people at the very top of our financial system. Clueless.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:43:05
Cool, thanks so much!! I'm a bit closer to understanding how this works.
It just seems strange that nodes are not rewarded, seeing that their work is so important. Dash does reward them, seems like a more secure system in that regards.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:21:28

@_date: 2017-10-13 18:37:10
Without trust, there wouldn't have been a NYA. And without a NYA, there wouldn't have been Segwit.
Are you suggesting that everybody who gets a chance to screw the other party should feel free to do so?
Somebody had to go first, Segwit or 2x.
And if BTC comes into a similar situation ever again, you can forget about any consensus where trust is involved. Believe it or not, trustworthiness pays off... for yourself as well.
