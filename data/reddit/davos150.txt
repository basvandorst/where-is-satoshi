Have you opened a ticket? And if so, got a reply? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:15:15
Ok cheers
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:09:04
Yeh absolutely dog shit. Am I right in thinking you can trade In EUR on Gdax now?

Registration plate was “satoshi” also

Have a large amount of GBP that I would have to send to my EUR account. Which would take a few days and lose a fair bit in fees.
Anyone know if this has been going on for a while? And when it is expected to be solved.
As may have to bite the bullet and do this. Thanks

I've been having this issue when buying through the app for weeks now. Have discovered If I purchase on my laptop it works no problem.

Seems to be issues with PayCash.
As I tried to deposit GBP last week and had the same problem
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:18:23
Do like Kraken, but can't currently deposit GBP due to "PayCash" not working, very annoying considering current price rise
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:42:01
But but but I waited 4 hours in the middle of the night on a Sunday for a confirmation because I'm a fuckwit and paid a low fee
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:24:09
Really makes you think when you read articles from a supposedly "reputable" source and you know they're talking shit.
About how truthful the other articles are that you don't know anything about.

@_date: 2017-03-21 17:18:34
True. But would the miners and their financial backers be so willing to invest again in a whole new generation of ASIC's?
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:21:17
Not before any ETF news i think

Trying to buy Coinbase down

What because other methods of remittance in Africa are cheaper than this $0.20-$0.50 flat rate, regardless of the size of the transfer??
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:40:22
Nice try CIA
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:47:23
I don't personally hence the speech marks 
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:48:12
Fair point
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:37:02
You forgot the risk with the second option if Core goes ahead with the visit to 2X City and the car breaks down. Instagram followers will be severely pissed and not want to follow these clowns anymore
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:40:59
Agreed, fair point. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:51:34
Like the internet being government approved?

We all get a little richer
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:34:59
Can confirm. Am English. Started off buying from Coinbase. And send all noobs that way who ask how to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:52:15
Yeh it is Vietnam, but I can guarantee they do. Also saw another shop close by selling Bitcoin along with other cryptos 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:58:35
From what I've seen I'd go with the second option. They seem to say one thing publicly and do another in this part of the world
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:30:18
Absolutely, if you use segwit addresses and send from a wallet where you can set the fee amount.
Also don't have to wait for a confirmation for a coffee sized transaction. As long as the vendor can independently confirm on there end that the transaction has been sent.

Was considering investing a little Ethereum. 
Won't be touching it with a shitty stick after reading this.

ELI5: Jihad's motivation for mining empty blocks? Thanks
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:23:20
You're welcome

I do when bitcoin breaks €4000!

I like to live dangerously 
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:10:28
Good to know. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:26:15
True but so is any investment.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:47:18
Not disputing the content of the article in this case. Just the fact it is driving more traffic to the website
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:01:19
And if everyone of those 21.6 million wants a whole one ������
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:09:49
Daily mail? GTFO
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:51:10
And yet empty blocks are still being mined? :/
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:42:21
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:41:32
As much as I would love to see this happen. Considering the current debate I don't see it happening. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:27:43
No such thing as bad publicity 
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:35:43
Not true. Could purchase from BitFury if your budget is in the millions 
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:49:55
Agreed, non-Segwit fix for ASIC-BOOST needed asap.
There should be no contention to it in theory 
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:17:00
I was introduced to bitcoin by Andreas via the Joe Rogan podcast.
Can't thank him enough 
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:08:10
Kraken, only real option for EUR
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:38:21
Have you seen localbitcoin volumes for the past week?
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:15:23
Yeh you're right, especially when your dealing with a million dollar plus investment 
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:16:54
Bitcoins dead, if LN doesn't live up to expectations???
Yeh you're right, as at the moment it's completely useless and has no real applications *sigh
