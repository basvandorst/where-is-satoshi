Haha Giving a seed was never an option. Segwit addresses started with electrum begin with bc so I will stay away for not I guess. How would I create P2SH segwit on electrum?

Electrum 3.0.5 uses the bc start to the wallet. If I was sending from binance to the wallet, would I have issues or is it more sending from the Segwit wallet to binance? Thanks I'm sorry if I sound ridiculous. I want to support Segwit but also don't want to be out some coins

Thanks for the info. Can I set fees if I use GDAX?

Ok so If I sent 2g out it would be 1975 comming to my exchange wallet basically?  I understand mining fees I just wish they would let me roll my own dices.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:00:12
So I could send a larger amount and it would be the same fee?

dude I have zoomed in, changed my entire systems resolution, magnification, take the box and extended it full screen. It doesn't have the information. Is it possible it uses some sort of format that might not be installed on a new computer?

Just did what you said but it just takes the window and makes it huge and cut off actually.
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:07:07
it is an empty wallet. I have once again resized the screen and then but still nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:51:45
yes that is what i'm after. I was gonna experiment with it to create an offline wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:26:21
I have uninstalled, reinstalled so many different versions. changed the screen resolution, magnification. Nothing works. It's so weird. I am new to armory but every video I see doesn't show this odd difficulty.

Can’t you just keep using a vpn?

I get that but I have heard that some Venezuelan people have their paypals held up and need an Offshore account to actually use them the way they were meant to.
