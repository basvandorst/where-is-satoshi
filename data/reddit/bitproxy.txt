When are you going to implement Litecoin?

Might want to update this or create a new post to explain you meant 400k BTC.

What does doge offer besides a reddit community? There are plenty of cheap cryptos, cheap doesnt mean better. Does your boss not buy Blue Chip stocks (Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc.) and only goes all in on penny stocks? Same principle. BTC costs more but is more likely to succeed than any other crypto. Doge could triple overnight like some penny stocks but it is incredibly risky and nobody knows when it might crash and burn in 2 seconds.
Right now I'm still riding out my short position but my portfolio when I go long is 50% BTC, 25% LTC, 25% PPC.

I doubt it. GoxBTC on bitcoinbuilder are still stuck in Bitcoinbuilder. In fact, you can still trade on bitcoinbuilder right now even with Gox offline. Since Gox is the only place that could buy GoxBTC and sell them for market price on another exchange directly, their strategy wouldn't have been affected by bitcoinbuilder.

That's a great point. I didn't even address a conspiracy theory because the facts alone are pretty damning not even theorizing ulterior motives. If they paused trading and bought 1500 BTC in bulk on Stamp that could easily swing the market up and then they can force shorts to close for minimal gains or even losses.

Ah that part is true. But you can still deposit real BTC and trade back and forth between real BTC and GoxBTC on bitcoinbuilder. But good point that the only GoxBTC available is the btc already on the books.
That said, I still think Gox could've bought at $100 on their own exchange and sold for $500 on bitstamp over and over until they were solvent. Not really sure why they closed operations unless they really did lose everything or they are getting acquired.

I am trying to withdraw via bitcoins not money since I don't want to deal with a wire transfer from Honghkong to the USA. I will be depositiing those BTC on BTC-e but their withdrawals are halted so I am waiting to do this. I will definitely let you know once I transfer the BTC to BTC-e.

Taxes aren't fun, but I think in this case its legitimate given that Bitcoins are more of a commodity and less of a currency these days (purchases aren't that common place these days, so even buying in BTC is like buying with gold to an extent).
When you pay $1000 for bitcoins post tax, and then buy something for $1500 with bitcoins, you pay capital gains of 15% ONLY on the $500 increase. So basically you would pay a total of $75 in capital gains tax -- that original $1000 value does not get taxed. Therefore, if you buy bitcoins for $1000 and buy something for $1000 you pay no additional taxes. Hope this clears things up!

Considering BTC just topped $600 I'd say $550 for 1 BTC is a deal right now.

Yes I am just worried that something shady might be going on because BTCE and Bitstamp have usually been very close together and now are about 15% apart. The only problem with CampBX is their depth seems very shallow, I only see around 15-20 total bitcoins in their buy depth chart before the price plummets $200 (whereas on btce/bitstamp/etc. there are hundreds of coins on either side of the spread).

An error I think you are making is looking at the current landscape and trying to imagine someone cashing out $20 million all at once. The bitcoin is currently valued at $400-450 because it's not mainstream yet. If and when it hits $10,000, then it will be because it is a regularly accepted currency at most businesses. If this were to happen, then that $20 million would just be like any other $20 million asset/good (for instance, selling a $20 million mansion). It actually gets easier because there's nothing to say that you have to sell all $20 million to the same buyer -- so in theory it would be like having a $20 million mansion that many buyers could buy a stake in.

Thanks for your reply. I am not transferring money to and from exchanges, merely transferring BitCoins from Coinbase to an exchange. Right now I am using BTCE but I am unsure whether I should be using Bitstamp or another exchange instead.
As I understood things, MtGox was priced higher since it was very difficult to transfer fiat out. However, BTCE and Bitstamp now have a rather large spread which concerns me, since they were about even a couple weeks ago. I do not intend to transfer USD out of any exchange, when I am done daytrading I will transfer the Bitcoins to Coinbase and cash out.

Wait what? You made $1200 on 3 BTC, aka $400 each by buying on Saturday? Wasn't it at around $600 on Saturday? Your numbers dont add up.....

While charity is always a good cause, this post is misleading. When you donate $100 to charity, it is taken out of the income so you dont pay taxes on that. What that means is if you donate $100, then you save $20 on taxes if you estimate your taxes to be 20%. So you still come out behind by $80 compared to not donating at all. That said, charity is always a good idea (but not for strictly monetary reasons).

Yes and charity is a worthy cause....but what you are saying applies to any salary. If you make 70k a year in a cubicle, you owe taxes but can donate to charity to pay slightly less taxes. Similarly, if you made 70k on bitcoins this year you could donate to charity also. In either case, financially you would have been better off not donating. For instance, if you donate 10k then you pay taxes on 60k (at 20% rate that means you pay 12k tax) whereas at 70k you pay 20% = 14k tax. So by donating 10k to charity you lose 10k + 12k = 22k of your 70k salary compared to 14k by keeping it all.
