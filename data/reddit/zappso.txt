The Colored Coins I’m familiar with happened half a decade ago, spawned similar projects such as Mastercoin (now OmniLayer) and Counterparty, and eventually became Coinprism.
A second tier token system off the Bitcoin blockchain can’t necessarily replace an altcoin, because you’re stuck with the base rules and protocols of both Bitcoin and the token system.

While it’s true that the future can’t be reasonably predicted based on historical data, it’s worth remembering that common algorithms and analyses attempting to do so are used by many. There is therefore some certainty in how a large number of traders (human and automated) will behave.

A master private key can’t be computed from child private keys.
If you provide the seed phrase or master private key to a malicious altcoin wallet, then yes all child
keys could be computed and bitcoin funds possibly stolen - even if you first move funds from one address to another within your bitcoin wallet.
Don’t import a master key/seed into an altcoin wallet if you still have bitcoin funds in addresses generated from that master key/seed.
You should only import an individual address’ private key into an altcoin wallet after first moving the funds in your bitcoin wallet.  I believe there was a malicious bcoin gold wallet recently that uploaded private keys and stole bitcoin.

This. Plus you’d still have to wait 10 minutes for a single confirmation, and an hour for complete confirmation.
Bitcoin is scaling in a much more intelligent way with Lightning Network, and bringing fast clearing times with it.
Don’t forget bcash is based on Bitcoin, and any modification of it could also be applied to bitcoin if it was a good enough idea.
Increasing the block size just puts more cars on the road and makes them go faster. Lightning Network builds more roads.

In short: no, they’re two different types of “mining”.
However, it’s possible that a game developer could incorporate a cryptocurrency mining system into a multi user online game, linking it with say the process of mining for gold in the game.

Your wallet is a collection of private keys that allows you to spend funds in the corresponding addresses on the blockchain.
If you give someone an address, back up your wallet, destroy your computer, receive funds to the address, then restore the wallet on a new computer, you’ll be able to spend those funds.
You can think of it like you have a bunch of keys to a collection of safes. Each one has a slot in the top where anyone can deposit funds. As long as you have a copy of those keys somewhere, you’ll be able to open the safes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:04:27
Each time you send funds to an address, you add to its unspent outputs. When you spend the funds, these outputs are used as inputs to a new transaction.
If you send all funds from an address, and there are many outputs, then a new transaction spending those outputs will be very large. This is because each separate output has to be signed
SegWit enables a single signature on multiple outputs, so reduces transaction size closer to if you’d had a single output.

No. When a block is solved, the miner has the right to claim the block reward. In this case, the miner opted to claim 1 satoshi less.

With blocks that size, it’d be so centralised it might as well not be a blockchain anymore.

ECC public keys are computed from private keys.
Any private key can be used to generate child private keys. The one at the “top” is the master private key.
Remarkably, a public key can be used to generate child public keys - and these actually correspond to the private keys.
Neither private nor public parent keys can be deduced from child keys.

So you have 100% faith in the random number generation and algorithm implementation your paper wallet generator used. Also you’re completely confident that the paper wallet website or software wasn’t compromised in any way and that your computer has no viruses or trojans. Also you’ll be destroying your printer before you throw it out, incase there is any trace of your private key cached in its memory/flash.

I explained it in a post yesterday.
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:24:47
What I mean is, "given 'attack', why select 'early'?"
I have a fairly methodical path from 'code' to 'easily', and 'almost' to 'open', but I can't apply it to 'attack' and 'early'.
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:10:36
Pick a number in the white area, extend lines out from it at each of the 5 angles in both directions to the border of the white circle. It seems there's usually only one bip39 word that is on any of the lines. The exception I think is 'code' and 'try' underlined both go through 1.
This appears to associate each number with a word. Not always sure how a word is paired with another, e.g. 'attack' and 'early' (intersects 2).
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:57:35
Agree. He’s on the wrong track. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:32:54

It’s drawn between the middle of the X and the middle of infinity symbol. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:12:20
Type your seed words into the BIP49 Mnemonic section. Scroll down to the Derived Addresses section. Copy/paste first address (maybe others, who knows) into a block explorer like blockchain.info. If it has a balance then you've won, and should ask for instructions on how to import the seed words into a wallet.

Line drawn through the center of the X and the infinity symbol seems to cut the circle in half..
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:55:03
‘Code easily attack early almost open’ are all valid words and in fact form a valid bip49 phrase, as do just the first 3 words. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:14:53
What about the clue “almost open”? Open isn’t in your list. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:50:41
Because it’s on an exchange. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:13:51
Draw a line under CODE and through the big 1 until it comes out of the bottom of the left stalk of B, where the second T in TIMESTAMP intersects. Draw a line from that point to the middle of the X in the box. It crosses a bottom outer corner of the B, just under the C in ATTACKER. Continuing the angle of CODE from that point lines up with EASILY, then follow that line back up and out of the left of the middle of the B, where the N of CHAIN intersects. From that point, draw a horizontal line left until it goes under ATTACK, then draw a line from the start of it through 2, which in that plane underlines EARLY.
For ALMOST/OPEN, draw a line under ALMOST and follow it up until it intersects the border of the B, under the K of ATTACKER. Then draw a line from that point through the middle of the X in the box, which underlines OPEN.
I can kind of see how these work - in fact I noticed this pattern immediately and it was my first hunch - but the underlying rules currently elude me.
There is some sort of transformation of lines under the words, via the border of the B, and through a corresponding number. I think the "challenge of the underlying security model" in the original post could be a clue that these transformations are based around how elliptical curve point addition works.

Correct. Most fudge does not contain gluten, especially plain fudge. Our main supplier manufactures almost 60 flavours, of which around six contain gluten. We only stock the gluten-free flavours. We've had many celiacs tell us they didn't realise fudge was gluten-free, so it's always good to advertise it as such.

Generate a paper wallet address and send your coins there.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:11:48
If you have the private key for the recipient address (ie it’s in a wallet you control), depending on the wallet, you should be able to export the private key. You should then be able to import it into another wallet, and send the funds to wherever you like.
In future,  look at using an exchange or shapeshifter.io to move between different coins!
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:30:52
I know people who do it for a living across multiple exchanges, now automated.  It’s not quite like day trading; with arbitrage you can’t lose.
Also know people who do Bitcoin sports betting arbitrage across multiple betting houses. This is where you take advantage of differences in odds on the same event, betting each way. You can’t lose unless one of the bets is cancelled and the others lose. Unfortunately because it’s not regulated, houses can cancel bets on you, but you don’t have that same luxury.

Bigger blocks are harder on the smaller node operators; with bigger blocks, they need more bandwidth and storage space to operate a node. Thus, the network becomes less decentralised.
SegWit is a building block for Lightning, which when deployed will enable sidechains for off-chain transactions, settled on the main chain when necessary.
If wallet vendors implement SegWit and make it standard, blocks can actually increase to 2MB - but only if every transaction in the block uses SegWit.
Increasing the block size is not a permanent scaling solution, as bigger blocks would eventually fill up again.
Also, increasing the block size doesn’t affect the network block production rate, which is every 10 minutes, an hour for safe transaction settlement. Conversely, SegWit and Lightning will enable instant transaction clearing on external networks.

It’s a nice conspiracy theory but ultimately doesn’t hold water. Total number of Tethers is around 400M. That’s a tiny fraction of the Bitcoin market cap. Relatively few exchanges worldwide deal with Tethers, and the volume growth we’ve seen hasn’t been driven purely by those exchanges.

It’s perfectly usable as a currency, I use it every day. Fees are now as low as 1 satoshi per kb. I paid 40c recently and got into the next block. 
Lightning Network is still in heavy development and testing. LN is not a fix, it’s a second tier network to scale Bitcoin. Transaction speed is drastically increased and will rival and surpass traditional payment networks. Give LN a chance to mature a bit more and be integrated into wallets, exchanges and payment gateways.
The energy used to mine Bitcoin does not have to be from coal, it can be from renewable sources. Miners are driven to more efficient power usage, as they’re all in competition. The power usage is the same whether there are zero transactions in a block or it’s full.
Cryptocurrencies will always be around, and Bitcoin is leading the pack for the foreseeable future; most of the research and development expertise, wallet and merchant integration, market adoption, etc. is in Bitcoin.
Please stop regurgitating FUD.

Yep. Simultaneously discovered here 
This pretty much proves Craig lied.  The SHA256 of that Sartre text is extremely (putting it mildly) unlikely to be 479f9...  He deliberately presented the Sartre text truncated, to prevent others from computing its real hash.  By claiming the hash was 479f9... he was able to provide a valid signature (that from the transaction described above). 
@_date: 2016-05-06 01:10:54

Craig's blog post may be convoluted and ambiguous but now you've shown it contains a big lie:

    479f9dff0155c045da78402177855fdb4f0f396dc0d2c24f7376dd56e2e68b05  Sartre


Either Craig is lying, or he has found a SHA256 collision where the hash of a text file of Sartre is the same as the hash derived from the transactions you described.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:12:52
Yep. Well done finding this. Your post should be stickied 
Edit: I've got it!  Craig's "cryptographic miracle" is his SHA256 collision between Sartre and a transaction signed by Satoshi.

They don't touch fiat so it's legal. If they sold shares and paid dividends in fiat, it could be argued that they're a money exchange and they'd need to be registered with fincen. If a virtual thing can be bought in fiat, sent to someone else, then transferred back into fiat, that permits money laundering and raises the attention of the authorities.

The specs for the Hardcopy II chips are [here](
In the section *Recommended Operating Conditions* on page 44, the various devices can operate at 1.5, 1.8, 2.5 and 3.3V. In the section *DC Operating Characteristics* on page 46, the supply current is a maximum of 5mA.
Of course, power consumption is design-dependent and I'm not sure what power the SHA256 code would eat, but I would estimate it would be in the order of tens to hundreds of milliwatts.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:13:03
It would be very time consuming to reverse engineer a fully custom ASIC. Much easier to design one from scratch, especially one that just does a double SHA256. It doesn't matter if existing ASICs are copied or new ones are designed - the more hashing power on the network, the greater the difficulty becomes and the lower the revenue per miner.
@_date: 2013-07-08 12:18:32
Yeah. 336Mh/s will get you about 0.24BTC/month ($18/month  If they're $140 each, that's 7 months ROI with the difficulty and exchange rate static. Doesn't seem like a good deal at all. Still, I guess that's why he's getting rid of them.

Yes, absolutely. There would have to be additional code to construct the blocks and pass to the SHA256 function.
@_date: 2013-07-09 06:47:28
Yes I did. The CNY/Bitcoin exchange rate doesn't reflect it either. If there truly is a rush of new merchants coming online, then you can hardly call it an explosion if the price is in decline. If merchants everywhere suddenly start accepting payments in wooden blocks, but wooden blocks are declining in price, you can't really say the scheme is a success.
Look, I love Bitcoin, I believe in it and I hope it succeeds. But while there may be many merchants adopting, it's not enough to counteract the problems imposed by the banks that are causing people to sell in droves. If it's that hard to exchange - a necessity in this fiat world - then why bother? It would have been more accurate for you to say there's widespread adoption but currently it's going nowhere.
