Lol this is the worst thing for Bitcoin. Just hands bitcoins price action over to the big boys. Not saying there won't be runs and what not, but the organic wild west era of BTC is over. Gonna be controlled now like every other commodity or Fx.

So if it doesn't affect the value of today's bitcoins why is there even a debate. XT sounds more future proof. If it has no impact on peoples current stash. Why are people so up in arms? 
Edit: Thanks for the response btw :)

Noob question, can't seem to find the answer. If XT becomes the main platform does that mean all BTC Core? that have been mined previously suddenly become worthless? Or do they get converted to XT? How does this work. 
Also I don't think it's very confidence inspiring when trying to gain mass adoption of a currency by having a bunch of nerds argue over the future of the currency out in public. This all really should have been handled in a more professional way. Makes BTC lose a lot of validity imo. *Flame suit on* . Like I said though, I'm just a filthy casual, so what do I know.

I'm a noob, but isn't this the only reason to use bitcoin? I was about to make a decent sized purchase and then started reading about all this drama. Kind of took away from the whole feeling secure about storing wealth / digital gold thing. 
Very surprised by all of this, and now I'm even more surprised that you say "That is the main reason to use Bitcoin, I just hope that there are still enough of us left" . What are the other camps of philosophy on the point of cryptocurrency if not for being digital gold?

So are XT coins separate from core coins? Can yo buy XT coins today?  IF XT is accepted then the pre XT mined coins would devalue would't they? This is the thing I'm not understanding. If there's no affect to the price of current coins then why wouldnt you wan't to switch to XT which supposedly is more future proof?
