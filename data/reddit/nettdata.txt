Most technology is iterative; something new and innovative hits, and then the flaws are found, then the next version comes out that fixes those flaws.  In some cases, the original company/technology dies after it's been replaced by that something better.  There are huge companies that are built on not being innovative, but watching for and improving on other people's innovations.
Don't see why this can't be an option here as well.
And it could very well be that it's not a "flaw", but if there's a perceived flaw, it could have the same impact if people (who probably don't truly understand the underlying technology) lose their trust as a result of sensationalist and erroneous "reporting".  That could still be a big win for any group that is anti-Bitcoin.

Exactly my point.  You're not at the stage where you can have Devs profit from their creations, and donations to help get this stuff figured out and get all the infrastructure in place could be helpful.
In my experience one should never underestimate the amount of work it takes to develop something like a "technical protocol paper"... sometimes that's the hardest and most time consuming part.
Again, just my unsolicited opinion.

What if their end game is to just kill Bitcoin?  What if it's a rival that wants to roll out their own virtual currency (that is designed to protect against this), or a government agency that wants to kill it outright?
Selling Bitcoins for profit isn't the only "successful" use case, depending on the scenario.

Just out of curiosity, what's your experience doing projects like this?
Personally, having done more than a few startups and open source gigs, I've found that you NEVER have enough cash.  EVER.  If people are willing to give you free money, without any expectations other than to help support your work on said project, I'd say take it.
If you're worried about donations establishing some sort of equity stake in the project, set up a simple document that states it's just a donation.
The more you can focus on this project, the better your chances of it being successful are going to be.  Free money helps with that.

Never mind facebook isn't a financial transaction.  The two are so far removed they're not even comparable.
