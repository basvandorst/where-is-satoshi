Balloon pilot from the US checking in. I do all corporate and commercial work, similar to this \(see [
Not sure how much you've looked into this, but there's a lot too it. I assume you already looked into it to some degree because you said the balloon will be manufactured in the UK \(Cameron or Lindstrand\). Speaking strictly practical, Dublin and Wicklow are really close to the water. You'll see the balloon companies in the area tend to use more inland locations like Trim.
Logistically, there are a few considerations. You'll need the envelope \(balloon part\), basket, burners, tanks, and ancillary equipment \(inflation fan, radios, ropes, tethers, etc\). You're looking at about $40,000 \- $60,000 new. If you only get a new envelope, and find the rest used, you'll end up spending more like $30,000 or so. You'll need a chase vehicle, which can either be an SUV with a trailer or a pickup truck. You're also going to need aircraft insurance, which is about $2,500/year. You'll use about $150 in expenses per flight \(propane, fuel, etc\).
If your goal is to take passenger rides, do a quick market survey. My search showed prices are around $270 per person. Assume a used balloon, and a trailer on an SUV you already own, and you need to fly around 40 flights with 4 people in each flight just to break even. For reference, a normal year for me is 30 \- 35 flights. 
I'm just trying to set realistic expectations of expenses that goes into a balloon operation. It's not cheap, at all. I'm happy to answer questions or expand on anything. Best of luck!

Where at in the midwest? Ohio is the $200 \- $300 per person rate \(depending on number of people, time of flight, etc\).
