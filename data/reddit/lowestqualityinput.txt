I keep clicking on the link in the picture but it won't come up? Also I see "buy the dip", "buy when blood is in the streets" a lot, would now be a good time to buy bitconnect?

Your post is great man. Although something to keep in mind about when you mentioned you'd feel more comfortable with your money in a bank account because it won't get hacked, stolen etc etc. 
The private key algorithm is quantum proof hard. Think about every grain of sand on earth and being able to put all your money in the 1 grain anywhere on the planet and then asking someone to find it (in this case it would be a quantum computer). This is why bitcoin using big numbers like quattuordecillion makes quantum computers look incredibly insufficient. 
You flip a penny 160 times, heads 1 tails 0 or vice verse you'll never get the same number twice. This is how secure bitcoin is. 
Bitcoin is valuable from that perspective, that is, you can know that your money is safe and nobody will take it, hack it, steal it etc. unless you are not in possession of your private keys, leave it on centralized exchange, then best of luck to you, you'll prob lose your money. 
From that perspective I feel safer having my money stored in bitcoin 100% more secure over a centralized bank account. That's the only piece that stood out to me, how secure bitcoin really is, everything else pretty much spot on right now.

Centralized systems are highly efficient and effective and I think they're great. Only downfall to them is their security. It sucks.
