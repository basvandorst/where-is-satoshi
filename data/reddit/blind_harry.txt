This will effect the interchange fees card issuers charge to merchant acquirers. However most online businesses use third party processors, using the third parties merchant acount. The third party processor typically adds a merchant fee  on top of the interchange fee they occur - profit. My question is does this ruling affect third party processors (the merchant fee) or does it just mean they have to pay the card issuer less. Thus more profit with the same fees. (Ex. Stripe 2.4% plus 20p while paying 0.3% to the card issuer.)

Traditionally an e-payment systems has 5 categories.
 1. Pre-paid card
 2. Debit card 
3. Credit Card 
4. Electronic check
 5. Electronic money
Cryptocurrency (bitcoin) is an extension to this - a decentralised electronic money. It is suggested cryptocurrency is the 6th category of an e-payment system.

I have a new Trezor. Do I just plug it in and set it up on Electrum or does it need to be done on myTrezor first? 
If someone can do a good step by step guide for Trezor and Electrum I will push some coinage their way.

I understand but they eliminate the volatility risk.

Last green 1 week MACD was August. The end of the rally to 600 before the long bear market we have been in. If you look at the charts every green 1 week MACD has been followed by a huge rally, usually to an ATH.

Well this completely turns my thesis on its head.

Having used Ryanair countless times I have to say that its a very good service for the price. £15 to Brussels from the UK. Not bad for a bunch of students wanting to go for a weekend away. The only problem I have is the constant sales pitches from the flight attendants - but you can just ignore them.
