Hmm, not sure what you mean. The chart exists literally to show you a visual of price history.

Liquidity reduces volatility. Not underlying trends.

So... this is your theory based on what — 30 minutes of price movement on a Sunday? Do they teach critical thinking in school anymore?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:07:14
You are falsely attributing a fictitious narrative to price movement that’s almost identical to the last few months.

Thank you so much for posting this. I'm going to go see a financial planner asap.

Yes, maybe — and the US has a right to enforce what it can when people violate their laws with US securities.

Let me know if you’d like UX feedback at any point.
One idea (still kind of half baked) is the analog of “spending wallet” and “saving wallet”. When you create a spending wallet, you are effectively creating a channel, but the user doesn’t need to know that. A saving wallet costs fees to move funds around because it’s just a regular wallet... but it’s sort of like a feature because it encourages saving ��

Is that all within the same 365 days?
Long vs. short capital gains are also a consideration.
Let's say you bought $1000 worth at 10k on day 1. You sell it on day 366 at $10k, which gets you your $1000 back plus $1000 in profit. You owe taxes on the $1000 at the long term capital gains rate, which let's assume for you is 15%. So you netted $1000-15%=850.
Now let's say you bought $1000 on day 1, worth at $10k, sold at $15k on day 100, now you have $1500 total. You rebuy at $12k on day 150 for the full $1500, and sell at $20k on day 200. You cash out and have $2500 now, or $1500 in total profit. But you owe the short terms capital gains rate, which is whatever your income tax bracket is (let's assume 25%). So you pay 25%*1500=$375 in taxes and get to keep $1125.
In this case, timing the market lets you come out ahead. But you can imagine that if you don't time it quite that well, it's easy to not come out ahead, because you have to overcome the additional tax burden of short term capital gains.
In the end, the vast, vast majority of people are better off just holding and/or DCAing and not trying to time the market. The one exception I'd make is if a big correction happens (20-30%), that's often a great time to increase your DCA and put a bunch in.

That he’s a Putin lackey, not a “journalist”. Maybe he once was a journalist, but not anymore — he’s been corrupted.

It’s Sunday... What exactly are you observing? Here’s a chart. Looks pretty damn typical to me.

TIL people still use WinRAR. How very 2003. I remember downloading Dreamcast games over dial up, one tiny RAR at a time.

In the next 5-10y, sure. Simple reason: stock-to-flow.

Hmm, you’re right. That being said, look at the cumulative effect. If there are 8m a day of fewer sellers, every 50 days it’s like there was a day with 0 sellers and only buyers, all else being equal. This creates the slow ramp and new levels that eventually attract attention and result in mania.

Relevant part of the article 
When you put it that way, the halving does seem like a big deal.

Miners I think mostly sell. Where I think you’re wrong if I understand what you’re saying is that $400 million is mostly net neutral ($200m buyers, $200m sellers). If you add $60m of demand or subtract $60m of supply, that kind of imbalance would cause price to fly.

I think you’re overreacting. It looks like a blip on the chart. I can’t even see it.

I was pleasantly surprised to see Bitcoiners here seeing through this guy’s BS. JP does not deserve the attention he gets.

This only matters if its energy that couldn’t otherwise be used and connected to the grid, like is true for some hydro in China.
