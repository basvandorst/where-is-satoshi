Core doesn't support hardware wallets, so if you want to use a hardware wallet with your own full node you basically have to run electrum with electrum server, or copay with bitcore backend, or something custom. They still connect via your core node. bitcoind is a great node but they're not aiming to be the best wallet.

It's an interesting perspective. Low value transactions have the same cost to the system as high value transactions, and receive the same benefits of security and censorship-resistance. There was always something idealistic about delivering the same benefits to everyone. Of course high value transactions are willing to pay more, but there's only one level of service and limited supply of it. For cheaper, less secure transactions you have to go to an altcoin, which is a problem.
It will be interesting to see how lightning changes the economics, since fees within lightning will likely be proportional to transaction value, which is more equitable in the sense of your comment, and is also aligned with the cost of resources being used.

10M is max order size, positions can be bigger (margin requirements go way up), we just don't see them as they get liquidated in 10M chunks.

Their insurance fund is 10k btc, which would be spent offering it at a really good price (covers ~20% loss on 50k btc position). That's on top of the maintenance margin, which is absurdly high for such a big position (so no one does it).
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:04:53
it's funny because this contract has no leverage and you literally can't be liquidated

It's definitely not the "state of the art in Bitcoin trading". It's a way for Canadians to buy and sell bitcoin (not a huge market). Once they have it they can trade it somewhere else with lower fees, better liquidity, and leverage if they want.

That's true, seems like their partnership with Voxelus is supposed to make both of them look more important than they are.

Yes but the good news is that when you update to  the new firmware, it verifies the current bootloader and will display a warning if it’s not genuine. So not only is it fixed going forward, it tells you if this exploit was used previously.

If they could do a large re-org then they could definitely get more than 1 block ahead, and some other miners would mine their chain, but a lot of alarms would go off and exchanges would be warned to halt withdrawals. The community would probably come up with multiple forks starting before the attack, with different PoW, PoS, or even just a one-time rollback with no change except invalidateBlock on the attack chain. The attack chain would be one of these options which may or may not be worthless in the end.
It would definitely cause a huge loss of confidence in cryptocurrency, but something would emerge to preserve at least some of the value. The way to actually break bitcoin for good is by breaking the digital signatures (quantum computers can do it), then you can't prove who owns what and any fork that comes afterward is also worthless. Still, some other quantum-proof crypto would survive, but we would really have to start over with balances and hundreds of billions of dollars in value would be gone.. poof.
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:36:58
That sounds more like magic, quantum computing is a real thing that doesn't claim to solve everything, and definitely doesn't give you god powers over physics.

The attack happens before you initialize the trezor, so either your private keys were always compromised (and your btc likely stolen), or they're safe. An attacker with physical access can load malicious firmware which gives you a seed or addresses that they control. Normally a warning would be displayed that the firmware is not genuine, but that's verified by the bootloader.

Miners are putting fiat into the market, via electricity and hardware costs.. if they choose to hold some, they're not much different from cash buyers, and you would count that as part of the 1800 btc/day that the market needs to absorb. But their mining cost will typically be less than the market price, so the actual amount of fiat entering could be a bit less than 1800*(market price)
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:28:39
A lot of cryptography currently in use would be broken, but it can be updated and it’s mostly only a problem if it happens way sooner than expected, like if there’s some secret lab that is decades ahead of what we consider state of the art.

only if you trust your family. she should run her own full node so he can't monitor or censor her spending. although she should probably install it herself in that case

Most people get cash from an ATM, and they trust the bank. But anyone working at a cash register will see counterfeit bills pretty often. I've seen someone get turned away with a fake $10, they sort of acted like they didn't realize it and I didn't know who to believe.

Segwit2X will need 95% of the combined market value to get 95% of the hashpower. Let's entertain that fantasy for a moment. Since the 1x price dropped so much, tx fees could be twenty times as large in BTC for the same USD cost. A typical fee of 150 sat/byte today translates to 3000 sat/byte, or 30 BTC per 1mb block (even more once fees get bid up due to slow blocks, and blocks are &gt;1mb 'cause segwit). The block is worth 3.4x the 12.5 BTC mining subsidy. So in fact, it could easily take 15-20% of the hashpower with only 5% of the price! If people want to transact on it, it will survive.
The only thing unrealistic about this scenario is 1x having 5% of the combined price.

It's not about node count, it's about the value of the mining reward (which depends on price, difficulty and fees). You can't force hashrate but you can expect it based on financial incentives. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:14:15
if hashrate drops in half the average block time is 20 mins and 2016 blocks takes a month

Must be a 100 BTC lot size (or contract size), he was short 9800 BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:29:54
Definitely this, plus the fact that any requirement of a minimum block size could just be foiled by a miner including their own transactions (which could be signed in advance, zero fee, and not yet broadcast).
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:07:51
Yes it is. Well it's inverse proportional. Every hash is an independent trial, if you play the lottery half as often you win half as often (which means it takes twice as long to win, on average).

In this example they need to pay out 7.5 times as much ETH, and it could be much worse.. the only way they can definitely pay it out is by holding BTC collateral, and converting it when the contract is closed. I would think that's what "fully collateralized" means.
Seems like this would require some pretty fancy cross-chain stuff to actually be trustless.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:07:11
They did not say ETH is money. They note that "the  ‘investment’  may take  the  form  of  ‘goods  and services,’  or  some  other  ‘exchange  of  value’."

looking at total sum of BTC margin funding (which is the reliable way), I see it increased by 3000 BTC (not 7000) between 01:30 and 02:30 UTC. for finer time resolution you can look at the volume of swaps taken at  BUT this doesn't account for the loans that are returned (it doesn't distinguish new shorts from loans that expired and were re-borrowed). anyway if you look there, the biggest loan volume in a 1-minute period was around 1000 BTC.
