I couldn't find a working website for them.

We'd love to learn more about your services for BitcoinHostels.com!

Nope. Not available yet.

Thanks for the support! We'll be inviting hostels around the world to add their property to the map that accept Bitcoin, so by the time you take your Eurotrip next year, we'll have plenty of places for you to stay at.

Hello. Thanks for your interest! I would say, start with reviewing what Bitcoin is all about:  Then, contact Bitcoin merchant processors, like Bitpay or Coinbase, and they can help set up processing Bitcoin to USD. You can also just open a wallet at Blockchain.info to accept Bitcoin and keep Bitcoin, but that is up to you. Good luck and definitely list your hostel on BitcoinHostels.com when you're ready!!!

Maybe so, but isn't Marc Andreessen on both PayPal and Coinbase boards? 
And aren't Andreesseen and Icahn at odds?

Ok, so my SJCX showed up in my account, which is cool, but there just wasn't any instructions after step 3, as I was expecting this new coin to show up in a new Storj account for me to use. Confusing, but I guess this is their first go at it.

Thanks. They should have added a step for that said, "Now you wait!".

Definitely on Coinbase's -

Maybe LocalBitcoins.com is the next best answer. Take a look at their forum for more answers:

I am, but since cell reception is fairly non-existent on the playa, how else can we exchange Bitcoin? Carry around a bunch of $1 paper wallets? Curious, as it would be good to know in these instances.
