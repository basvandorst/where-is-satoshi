Some aspects of the future can be predicted. For example the price/performance ratio of information technology (How many computations you can get for an inflation adjusted dollar) doubles every year.

Yeah she is good looking. 10/10 yeah possibly. But what is under the Wig? That could take her down 4.5 easily if it's ugly under there.
Like frazzled blonde with one million split ends? What is she hiding?

I still can't get over that interview.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:56:27
Are you serious?

Name another double bubble? Bitcoin already had it's blow-off-top. Went up to $1000 and then back down 90%.

It's highly likely because the current financial system is a bad deal for most people. The big banks get to front run the rest of the system with 0% interest loans, and they charge too much. It's like if you're charging consumers $10 for a razor blade that cost 15 cents to make, you're creating an opportunity for Harry's or the Dollar Shave club to disrupt your market. BTC is the Dollar Shave Club for money.

Price and value are everything. BTC is currently a way better deal for storing money than fiat. So that's partially what's driving the price increase IMO. In comparison to BTC the USD loses value over time, and it's basically impossible to get any kind of reasonable fixed return without significant risk. So it's a good store of value, and at some point in the future it will probably become a better means of transacting. If it does not, then the protocols built on top of it will. It's kind of like the email protocol, on top of which all kinds of other things are layered.

Am I like a Diva or something? Why did no one else mention the hair?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:42:02
Am I the only one who could only focus on her hair? LOL that's a wig.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:51:41
I'm panic buying lol while it's low
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:18
Me too. This is a relief actually.

If BTC captures just 1% of the global FOREX market that's an implied valuation of $100,000 USD per coin. If it gets to 10%, that's $1,000,000 per coin. No one can predict the future but it's highly likely.

She was totally wearing a wig. That's like the most obvious wig ever.
