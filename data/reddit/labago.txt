Not the worst idea
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:27:19
Very true
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:25:15
Ya I am still trying to figure out the tax part...I have moved coins around a lot, traded, this and that, for a period of 4 years. I could prob go back and find all the transactions but it would be so time consuming....
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:36:35
Well spake indeed
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:45:33
Still have yet to get any concrete information from them and I've talked to 2 support people over the phone....
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:33:57
Store in USDT, slowly cash out
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:47:39
What I mean is store it there, when you want to cash out say 5k, transfer the equivalent to BTC then move to Coinbase or an equivalent, then cash out
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:07:29
How do you know? haha, I have called them twice now, and both times they said it had already been escalated...last time I called was 5 days ago, time before that was prob 3 weeks ago.
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:21:18
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:13:36
There was already a transaction to that address from a week ago
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:39:39
Upvoted to high heavens, denounced to hell in comments. wut?
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:01:01
Well it put my friends company in a stand still and they could not progress on work, how do you suggest it should have been resolved?
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:23:55
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:14:14
Meh, wasnt my problem
@_date: 2015-12-20 04:38:09
Can anyone second this? This is the service I use, though I don't know if its safe or not
@_date: 2014-01-14 14:08:50
Yes they said they would have this soon
@_date: 2014-09-21 04:42:05
I spend wherever I possibly can? I want to add this to the list
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:09:27
Question: When we say "Storing coins" we really just mean storing the private key correct?
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:53:35
Increase in transaction volume is probably going to be the driving force, I did not think of that but to me that makes the most sense
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:08:41
I did this last year, 10 dollars each, worth less now so its lost some credibility in their eyes of course.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:48:50
This is not ELI5 at all, it was actually horrific. But at least he gave it a shot...
@_date: 2014-07-11 13:26:05
Like for example, I used to use the QT bitcoin desktop application and there was an option to "encrypt" the wallet with a passphrase
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:04:42
I'd buy more but I'm already maxed out 
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:28:31
Just sent him 5 BTC, cant wait to get my 500 BTC back!
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:04:38
Remind Me 4 hours "watch this"
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:40:04
You are betting on the price going to 2000-3000 by Q2 next year in order to MAYBE profit. Overall, not worth it, just buy BTC
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:55:30
Can you encrypt these?
@_date: 2014-11-18 05:13:53
Put your hand under it
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:12:55
So its a form of bitcoin spamming? lol
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:33:57
I read the tippers words like the scause for applause guy from South Park
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:56:36
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:52:57
I am not at all mad about this
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:37:20
Can someone please confirm something about this so my raging boner can go down?
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:07:25
This video by him  changed my entire view on the dollar and really just rocked my world.
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:45:23
Torrented. Donated. Thanks for making this!
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:24:16
I tipped the wrong person hahaha oh well enjoy your bits
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:00:35
Aren't they just an free site builder company?
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:00:58
Should i be worried about this?
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:22:22
Merry Christmas ya filthy animal!
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:34:44
Good to know thanks
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:35:00
100 bits @_date: 2014-02-06 14:27:39
I think this guy is now phone-less with no replacement
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:00:30
Dude. That's fucking amazing
@_date: 2014-10-09 11:51:25
Just use the global currency that's already in place. What's its name again?
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:54:16
I know that it sort of goes against what Bitcoin is about, but I am thinking more about people that take advantage of credit cards in terms of rewards points. If you're not paying any interest, than the company is just paying you to make payments with their card and as of right now Bitcoin can't compete with that right? (aside from its other benefits)
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:32:39
On second thought, this was very poorly done
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:36:20
Did you even try?
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:57:04
What a guy
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:13:06
Oh man you know how to inspect an element and edit HTML? No way!
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:57:20
300 bits thanks for the insight
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:21:06
@_date: 2014-11-19 01:43:35
On top of that, with bitcoin you are not sharing any personal or sensitive data. With apple pay and the like, you are still transfering those details.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:06:38
This makes me nervous haha
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:13:48
Same here, I ended up breaking even, but even having it a month earlier would have made me some nice coin.
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:01:11
Aanndd cancelled. Sick
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:34:47
@_date: 2014-09-21 18:25:52
Thats really good to know, I may switch to them
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:33:37
Its the first thing I do on any account with sensitive data on it, if its available. If its not available, I question using the site at all
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:50:36
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:14:29
If that ever happened companies can easily switch to Bitpay or any other payment platform. Not that big of a deal, and Coinbase is doing just fine anyway
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:57:56
This is by far the coolest thing I have ever read about. The future is fucking awesome.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:29:43
I do like this idea as another precaution though
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:21:43
I guess from a web developers point of view, I hate it. From a usability point of view, I am sure it works fine.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:20:59
But their service is really good...
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:08:28
They claim that "For this, please be advised that Mint maintains bank-level security, and uses the same 128-bit encryption and physical security that banks use. Our practices are monitored and verified by TRUSTe, VeriSign and Hackersafe, and supported by RSA Security."
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:08:56
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:07:01
The only way to incorporate my coinbase.com account as an investment on the site is through the API key
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:14:57
This is so cool
@_date: 2014-12-04 19:21:13
He has the potential to have a very, very thick beard
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:34:17
I never mentioned anything about a secure online wallet...
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:37:09
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:44:24
Wow. I already knew a lot about bitcoin, but this explains it so well that I just learned a ton more.
@_date: 2014-10-01 02:28:16
Never given anyone gold before, but this blew my fucking tits off. Paid for in Bitcoin of course
@_date: 2014-09-21 04:28:25
I suppose that's fair, just a hassle to switch. If enough people express interest it would be another provider accepting Bitcoin, I'll give them some time haha
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:26:20
I mean merchants could start using the message field of a BTC transaction just like a credit card does, but I haven't seen much of this I don't think
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:44:34
I've thought about this, but isn't it hard to get what each transaction was for with Bitcoin? Also, Blockchains app allows you to add watch only addresses and tally's the total BTC in all of them.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:32:39
Super Upvote
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:41:58
For the convenient merchant tools they provide. Its not easy for a non tech savvy business to come up with their own BTC acceptance practices.
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:30:48
Well, not really looking for a card, but rather a real bitcoin wallet that is attached to a creditor, so all my transactions would go through their system (credit), then pay them back at the end of the month
@_date: 2014-09-23 13:20:31
Thanks! This worked, i was surprised....and yes I am going to switch back to linux eventually
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:27:53
Purchased a book for my sister! Thanks for the discount!
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:46:28
Then how would the network run?
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:48:09
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:54:27
I'd love to be able to CPU mine haha I think that's wishful thinking though
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:11:19
I always thought you paid a standard fee per transaction. So, if you grouped a ton together it would only be the cost of one transaction. If you are grouping them together, how do you know how much to give for a miner fee if that can go up as your TX size goes up?
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:06:55
Whos they?
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:58:24
Probably true, I am curious what these solutions will be
@_date: 2014-01-25 14:57:03
Ya I was gonna ask them about that because it makes no sense for how much info you have to give them
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:26:38
what say you?
@_date: 2014-10-08 19:14:14
Wix sucks in general. But this helps either way
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:03:36
So I should get out of the bitcoin game and sell everything?
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:04:29
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:00:18
I made a paper wallet a few months ago through Coinbase and have stored a good amount of BTC on it, will I be able to move these BTC with this bug???
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:23:03
Can confirm. Did it this morning
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:39:59

Something about sending my paycheck to someone else, trusting they will send it back irks me
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:49:12
See top comment. Better way of looking at it
@_date: 2014-10-10 04:30:41
An email I never use. More details -&gt; [here](
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:36:35
Thanks for the laugh 2000 bits @_date: 2014-01-24 19:15:02
Ya, that would make a lot of sense
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:40:09
Someone is just going to make an exchange for this specific type of alt coin?
@_date: 2016-06-21 11:48:16
I think 5k BTC
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:59:47
I believe in their product, and I use their app all the time. The mycelium wallet is awesome. I didn't give them THAT much money
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:12:01
Ya my biggest regret is giving them a Bitcoin for that God damn scam of a crowdfund. Lost 4k because of that and as of right now there is no where to trade my worthless mycelium token back for anything else.
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:09:52
They dun fucked up now. Really too bad, I used them all the time to buy BTC, back to coinbase...
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:38:12
The price is going to crash once all exchanges start accepting BCC deposits
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:40:53
What's wrong with using bittrex
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:09:37
OK was just checking if there was an issue with Bittrex in general
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:45:44
Ya sort of my confusion behind the whole thing
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:59:08
Too late now. Crowdsale is over
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:45:28
I mean sure ya
@_date: 2016-11-10 18:34:31
You mean below?
@_date: 2016-11-10 19:53:20
Ah, makes more sense now
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:27:55
That transaction is already processing, and wouldnt that hinder me in the future for making actual bitcoin buys?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:27:20
Removed, I apologize
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:28:49
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:56:31
Fair points
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:47:36
I wish boston looked like this
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:13:14
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:35:32
Yes I had already done that before this, never store any coins online. If I had, this person would have made off with my coins easily.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:16:20
2 BTC
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:21:39
Mistakes were definitely made, to me it looked like a quick gain before it continued to fall. I still think later today it will drop below 3300
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:26:12
Yep :/
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:51:54
This was absolutely insane. I bought back at 2960 and then 10 min later it's at 3350. Sell. Quick money grab for me!
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:21:39

@_date: 2017-09-15 14:35:43
Well its like you just said, depends on your goals. Long term i really do believe it will reach 50,000. When will that happen? No idea. Short term though just stick to the basics, buy low and sell high. You got screwed with the China drop, but dont make it worse by selling low and losing, just have to wait until you can sell for a profit, instead of a loss. Or just hold and forget you even have them, then check back when the price peaks again sometime in the future
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:26:03
I'm typically a long term holder, been holding for years. But when I see an opportunity to make some additional btc gains I'll take it, like the past few days
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:26:12
Yep :/
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:17:26
Whatever dude making money
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:13:21
I thought the BTG fork already happened?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:35:43

2 BTC
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:20:25
Doing a quick profit overtime calculation if you bought an S9 for $2000 which mines at 13 TH/s you would by far come out at a loss if the price stays at 5,000, if the price got to 20,000 in the next 6 months you would just barely make a profit of maybe a few hundred dollars, but this assumes a 24/7 uptime with no issues and no variance in hashing power....
See this [chart](

@_date: 2017-10-12 17:46:24
I am asking you to show me, to my knowledge all calculators use the same basic algorithm, its not complicated
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:46:46
Even if the price were 20,000 it really doesnt make sense for an average person to go buy an ASIC and mine
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:51:54
This was absolutely insane. I bought back at 2960 and then 10 min later it's at 3350. Sell. Quick money grab for me!
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:03:18
So how do you encrypt the paper though?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:33:50
People spend btc constantly.... everyday.... because it works as a currency
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:31:50
I also think this may be the case but I have also read that apparently the fork has already happened...so people buying in hopes of free money simply won't see that
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:25:02
It obviously becomes more profitable as the price increases, but its not profitable period at the moment. I use the same calculator I use every time you can find it [here]( I didn't "find one that fit my argument" show me a counter example.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:30:47
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:30:04
It's still a thing, it's what runs the network, but it's really not viable for your average person to do anymore for profit
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:16:50
Fair enough
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:56:14
Ya because we all know how much fun it is when bitcoin crashes...
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:35:45
Then you answered your own question, dont invest that
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:29:36
Available on Scottrade. (dont use scottrade though, they blow dong)
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:21:44
Same story here
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:50:34
I wont regret anything, I have owned BTC for the last 4 years, I would only miss out on owning more than I already do. Personally the price feels inflated, but everyone can make their own judgments
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:38:42
Not really an issue we didn't invest THAT much.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:36:37
It HAS to correct itself, I would imagine very soon, but that doesn't mean the correction is permanent, just like it wasn't when this happened 2 years ago. I'm buying more when it dips
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:32:09
Ya I'll get right on that
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:15:17
Former FBI Agent. FTFY
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:08:55
Gotcha, that's what I figured, because that number was staggering
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:33:12
Half way through and I really couldn't ask for a better way to present this to the general public. Really fantastic job
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:34:27
And Coinbase, seen them a number of times
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:02:23
Nope, all still hodling
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:43:16
I wish he would mention that small fact. Even though its obvious, a lot of people don't realize the fact that you can do the same things with cash when thinking about Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:54:32
Seriously. At least pick someone to interview who is against it with a real argument
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:14:16
Fair point. Can't have your cake and......
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:53:42
Ya I really don't understand that. Unless the deep web includes like sites not indexed by search engines, or sites without DNS.
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:54:58
If anything he is taking on more risk that way
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:03:53
He gave the that fuckhead nay sayer more time.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:34:20
Would be a nice gesture if I could get my money back for this shit mycelium token...
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:24:30
I'm not convinced it was a scam, I just think it was a really bad investment on my part... :(
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:22:08
ya a googledrive hosted file seems like a satoshi dice site. Good call
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:15:47
But people didn't have to invest in gmail to use it, it's a little different to me when people are putting their own money into a beta system.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:25:18
Besides the incredible delays, I have had my Little Single running at 24 GH/s for a month straight with no issues
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:29:20
I would buy this in a heart beat
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:18:42
that looks safe
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:20:56
I suppose that's a fair statement haha. I just remember telling my parents and when I said it was still "experimental" i got the "well that sounds safe" look
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:14:33
And don't say when it gets to version 1.0, be more substantial than that. Like what is there left to do?
