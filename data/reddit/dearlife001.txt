 Not agree. You do not have to use bitcoin to buy coffee or other inexpensive things. But bitcoin should have the ability to do it. This is what “money” should be capable of.

【更大风暴将至：监管酝酿取缔比特币交易平台】财联社8日讯，接近监管人士表示，比特币交易平台已沦为非法经济活动洗钱和庄家操纵价格洗劫散户的通道，应尽快予以取缔。除了非法经济和勒索，目前基本没看到比特币的实际应用。用比特币洗钱可以绕过管制将资金转移，尤其是在中国目前还存在资本管制的情况下，针对这种行为应尽快出台监管措施。取缔比特币交易平台，并非是取缔比特币。取缔平台是取消比特币与法币大量兑换的通道。（ 中国证券报

Abra uses multisig smart contract wallet to let you trade cryptos without giving up the control of your fund. While coinbase is a centralized exchange which has the full control of your cryptos.
