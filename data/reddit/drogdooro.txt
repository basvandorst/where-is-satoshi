If you're buying from you bank account you have to verify. You could also buy from some random guy on the street in cash without verifying. Localbitcoins.com

Perhaps me being a winkel is a bad example, let's say I'm some clerk at the sec who knows the verdict and is not already heavily involved. 
I did more research, and I still think it would not be considered illegal under current laws
Please let me know soon, I only have a week do execute these trades ;)

I don't think Bitcoin represents the entire value of humanity. More a portion of that value, other portions are held by different assets. I do believe the Bitcoin portion percentage will increase though

I like your gold analogy. 
What if you knew your company would begin producing a product or using a process that required something like 1kg of gold a day. This surely would increase gold demand and likely increase price. In this altered analogy would buying gold with this private information be considered illegal insider trading?

Perhaps you made a false assumption

I have a hard time believing it could encompass all value. Its value market share could continue to increase asymptotically. One drawback of Bitcoin is that it relies on the Internet and electricity. If there were an EMP your btc would be of no use to you. While other stores of value would be

At first I thought you were joking about the .03 BTC price, maybe it was some time in the future after btc spiked again. But nope, that’s actually over $300

I like this analogy. Bitcoin really don't give a fuck. Someone once told me that in a relationship the party that cares the least has the most power. Banks, comprised of people, definitely care about losing their position
