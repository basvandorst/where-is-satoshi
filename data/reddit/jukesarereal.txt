As a product of such high education I'm surprised your reaction to Ver is so emotional and irrational. If he is so bad, shouldn't we want everyone to know? The engineer in you might struggle with holding "two opposing thoughts at once and not imploding" (Fitzgerald), but the real world isn't so clear cut as "a = b".

No you can't do any of it in a decentralized manner with Bitcoin. At least not yet, and probably never. As everyone here always says "Bitcoin is a store-of-value" so why would we expect it to be able to do anything else?

Holy hell. I did not make the case that "miners were mining at a loss". I fully understand oppurtunity cost and that is most likely what u/BTCrob and others mean when they say "mining at a loss". 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:05:48
What should we call Bitcoin? Expensive coin? $7 fees coin? Slow transaction coin? Wake up.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:25:30
They weren't mining at negative profits necessarily just not as many profits as they could have made. And you're nuts if you think some amount of miners would EVER stop mining the BTC chain. Why? Because of ideals.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:27:13
Yes clearly it's not at a true loss, just less profitable. In a sense still... "at a loss"
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:51:57
Bitcoin fees are ~$5 at the moment and on average 110 minutes to settle. I'd rather use a CC or Paypal.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:53:45
How exactly am I a shill? Because I'm stating legitimate concerns about Bitcoin's transaction times and fees?
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:08:30
See what I mean?

You don't need capital to have value. Simple supply and demand dictates price. Anyone that knows anything about markets knows this.

Scorn? This is how blockchains work. I know you're new to the community, but this is how hard-forks work. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:26:28
The idea came from who I replied to. But ya, It's not truly at a loss. It's just less profitable. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:38:04
The name is pretty inconsequential. Market Cap is a better measure of dominance. All I'm doing is pointing out how silly it is to ignore the transaction and fee problem.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:25:44
Can't make any counter points? Just trolling? "Redditor for 2 days" makes sense
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:31:56




They work at a loss because they are trying to uphold ideals. For the same reason, Bitcoin miners are now working at a loss because the feel that BTC is technically superior, the original chain, or whatever reason.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:34:55
I fully comprehend. You're missing a huge part of this:
If I go buy a coffee, I need the transaction to go almost instantly. If you tried to buy a $5 coffee with Bitcoin, unless I pay an extraordinary fee, that transaction is going to take forever (as you just said 1-3 days). 
Against BTC, my credit card is crushing it. I pay and vendors that trust that money is coming. A centralized company (MasterCard/Visa) is trusted by almost everyone such that that payment is EFFECTIVELY instant. AND, it's insured by these companies in the case that something goes wrong.
There are some other blockchains that would be much better for this... that take ~10 seconds and have extremely low fees. But Bitcoin is not one of them. But, please set up my Starbucks state-channel.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:14:01
Miners are 80% in favor... but I do hope 2x doesn't go through. Doubling the blocksize would have saved Bitcoin for a while. Now bitcoin's major feature is high transaction costs. I hope you have your networth in BTC. Sleep well.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:00:13


Hypothetically, had they not called off Segwit2x and hypothetically if that chain had the majority hash power (which it appeared it was going to) would you be saying "Bitcoin can't fork"? 
Or would you have stuck with Segwit1x no matter what? 
And is your expectation that Segwit will make BTC scale well into the future (not working currently) or is it the Lightning Network that is our savior? Or are high transactions costs fine because Bitcoin = gold?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:09:22
That's not really true. Any chain can fork and sometimes you have to fork for certain rule changes. Semantically, you can call the predominant chain whatever you want, and you can cry all day that it's not the real Bitcoin, but you don't decide that. The miners decide what Bitcoin is or isn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:16:05
Consensus is of the miners and it was objectively highly in favor of 2x. Don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:57:08
I searched and found some shitty answers at best. Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:30:32
Of course, but if the fork is uncontested and there are no miners on the original chain, the original chain disappears. 
And yes, the UASF that activated Segwit changed Bitcoin's rules so yeah
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:30:41
Rules without rulers? A 6 person oligarchy called off the fork...
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:26:07
One more thing. Segwit, while only a soft fork, is still adds new rules. I just generally think your logic is flawed here.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:01:55
Even if you could, you wouldn't want to. You'd pay 20% in fees on a $10 pie.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:47:26
I know you're only 7 weeks into the game, but can you give some real arguments instead of shitposting?
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:59:46
No one's head is "in the noose." Everyone is familiar and agrees upon the terms.
Presumably the stake-holders are choosing a credible ad company. Also, if the ad company wants a gig like this again (a 10 second NFL commercial is probably a few million USD), it is in their interest to do a good job. 
As I said the possibilities are endless with this contract. If you're worried about the ad not being good, the stake-holders can devise a payment scheme to fit their needs. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:45:45
Does usability matter? It's hard to buy coffee efficiently with my BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:50:13
The millions of dollars at stake here for an NFL ad make this hypothetical outlandish at this point I agree. But if you wanted crowd-fund an ad that appeared at a local station for a few thousand dollars, that could be done with no issues. 
I'm pretty salty that you're strawmanning every argument I make. I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're continuing to miss every point.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:56:48
It would be exactly the opposite of what you're describing.
You could make an ICO for this commercial where all the funds raised are locked in a contract on the blockchain. People buy a stake in the ICO to fund the commercial. Stake-holders then vote to hire a commercial studio. Then, they vote on the terms of that commercial studio's contract. Then, they vote on how to release funds to the studio accordingly. 
Not much **trust** needed.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:30:54
The ad company could make the ICO for the Ad itself. No **trust** required.
The stake-holders vote the proposal they want from a reputable XYZ ad company.  The stake-holders agree on payout scheme for XYZ ad company. XYZ provides a legal contract to an appointed stake-holder agreeing to the terms. Stake-holders view the written contract online on their ICO website. Stake-holders vote to approve payment mechanism. Smart-contract can be reviewed by all parties and releases funds per the scheduled voted on by the stake-holders.
Again, not much **trust**.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:25:09
Is it more likely you will raise a few million USD on Kickstarter or GoFundMe from a bunch of crypto people? And if you did, where do you keep the money? How are the contributors assured of their money won't be swindled or misused? What guarantees do they have that the ad company will not put their "C" team on it like you suggest?
Or is it more plausible that crypto investors would put money in an ICO system like I described? A system where the funds are trustlessly held in a smart-contract and each stake-holder has a vote.  A system where the ad company is paid out in installments and held accountable for their work. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:27:47
All to be handled and voted on by stake-holders who agree to the terms of the ICO. Maybe they keep funds in reserve? You can answer all your own questions.
You're saying this is a hindrance, but there is really no other platform in existence that you could raise funds and manage them in a decentralized way. In any other situation, crowdfunding is centralized and therefore more risky. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:47:26
Sure. But you have to admit that a random function has nothing to do with the example we were just talking about. Yes, gambling games do require an oracle and some trust. But setting up a crowdfund on Ethereum is much different and much more feasible. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:31:29
They don't do work unless votes have already gone their way. They go into the whole deal understanding that a lawsuit is not possible and they understand the risk involved with smart-contracts and the nature of these blockchain crowd-funds. The point is to split the "trust" you are talking about up evenly between the stake-holders and the ad company. This can be done with incremental payments or many other ways. The smart-contract could even be linked to a prediction market like Augur or Gnosis and trigger the final payment when the ad actually runs. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:30:47
Your initial statement is "I don't see how this would work" referring to an ETH platform for crowdfunding a Superbowl ad. I just explained to you how it would work. 
You are clearly familiar with the space, but you're making it too complicated. It is completely possible to make an arrangement with smart contracts, have a voting system, and crowd-fund a project like this. ICO and smart-contracts are now commonplace and this isn't even hard to do anymore. 
Voters don't need to be on call 24/7. But, being that they are funding the project, they have a vested interest in being active anyway. If you're worried about efficiency, they can even create a representative comittee if they so choose.

I just read they had 1.7+ billion under management in the fund. You could very well look to the pleiades, passing comets, or read your horoscope for stock guidance and make less than &lt;10% return.
