That's shitty, is the hosting service Btrash supporters or just not crypto friendly? Maybe 99Stack could be an alternative, they use Cryptonator which besides bitcoin also accepts a few alts. It also has a discount if you pay with Cryptocurrency instead of PayPal.

Nobody expects that to be free, the amount of morons who think it's free is a problem tho.

Banks restricting access isn't the same as banning even if the effects may be similar in a nearly cashless society. And yes, they do tax cryptocurrency profits the same way they tax profit from a business you own.

I never really understood the logic behind "slow payments". Why should a merchant (say a coffe shop) put more trust in a customer paying with a credit card than a customer paying with Bitcoin? why is it so much better if the customer can issue a chargeback up to 120 days after the payment was made than if the customer within 10 minutes can deploy a shitload of ASIC miners to perform a 50% attack and cancel their payment. Who would do any of that just to steal a cup of coffee? And if you buy more expensive stuff like a Lamborghini or a house why is it a problem to wait max 10 minutes for the transaction to confirm just to be sure the payment was made successfully.

The amount of transactions is not linear towards the network hash rate in the same way as the number of bank employees, offices etc is linear to the amount of bank transaction. More people will mine when the price goes up but the network itself can easily scale up with the current rate theoretically making Bitcoin more efficient than fiat assuming the same amount of transactions, assuming scaling methods like segwit and the lightning network is widely used.

If the government thought to ban currency or shutting down the entire internet (only way to stop P2P traffic used by blockchains and other decentralized apps) were a reasonable solution to stop terrorism they would have done that already.
@_date: 2018-05-03 07:24:07
Yep, and the funny thing there *(spoiler) is how they centralize everything even more after the first successful attack.

They could do that, but with Bitcoin at least you can keep your coins and use them again once you're released from prison. With gold, the government would just confiscate it and lock it up somewhere safe while you're in prison and thus you wouldn't get it back once you're released.

As long as the government can't steal them from me I'm happy

They don't need money to lend out money. When a loan is issued they just print new money, thus making your savings worthless which is why they charge you to keep your money in a bank account.

You can still pay even if the server used by your bank goes down. My bank's server literally burned down a few days ago and I couldn't receive fiat payments from my customers for days.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:56:53
Then how do they make enough money to cover their own operational costs? There are fees, even if you can't see them. Ever wondered how much your local shops pay for their credit card processing equipment for instance.

With their huge block size, low price, no antispam features and lack of optimization it's gonna be impossible for individuals to host their own full node which eventually means that all full nodes will run on cloud servers located in centralized data centers.
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:35:15
For that price, I'd buy as much as possible tho.
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:27:58
But no hook for a trailer so it won't be useful for the btrash people with full nodes.
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:02:12
Better get some cheap coins then if they decide to buy fiat again.

I'm skeptical to Honey coin, it'll attract bears which would make it a bearish market.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:41:02
I can offer you the same services for your bitcoin payments if you're willing to pay 80% more than the gross value for everything you buy online like you do today.

Which is a terrible property for a product/asset you need in order to pay your bills.
@_date: 2018-06-20 07:51:36


Which is what makes it a valuable asset. Fiat only has a value because the government/bank say so, the asset itself is essentially worthless and its price can easily be manipulated by printing more to create artificial inflation.


Value doesn't require an asset to be backed by anything. Anything with a market value is backed by itself as it has the value people are ready to pay for it. This value is entirely based on supply and demand.

Supply and demand, gold can be used in electronic components and other industrial assets... for now. Same goes for oil, oil is fuel... for now. What value will gold and oil have once they're no longer needed? 
Same goes for Bitcoin, it'll have value as long as it's considered a store of value or currency.

Deflation where a result of people trying to exchange their USD for gold after the banks lend out the same gold multiple times. If the banks didn't do that and instead just kept the gold with 0% inflation, the great depression may never have happened.
Inflation/deflation are only the symptoms of the problem. The cause is the irresponsible banks.

In a non-transparent system where only you have full access and insight, chances are high that you start to misuse the system for your own benefits assuming that the worst consequence could be a minimal loss of your profit in "fines".
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:50:21
As long as people think so, nobody will investigate.

What are you trying to draw my friend?

To be fair, all these jokes about their insanely huge blockchain only works if people actually use btrash as often as they use their VISA card. It's like buying a car without an engine and then brag about how great it is, sure it might look great but when you need it it's not gonna be a very great car.
