You mean the charts where BTC dominance was 90% two years ago and now it’s 60%? Those charts?
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:10:29
Use Coinbase Pro.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:57:54
I trade the charts, I don’t give a fuck about Bitcoin, ETH, or Trumpcoin. 
Keep hodling away as BTC dominance is once again eroded on the next alt cycle.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:42:42
There are more projects being built on ETH than any other crypto, including BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-31 06:31:10
If you look at the graph it shows a pretty big drop in September.
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:38:54
They are fully insured. 
If you're talking about BlockFi worst case scenario they go bankrupt and your crypto is returned to you. It's how the company was structured. Customer assets are separated from company debt.

I've been using it for 3 weeks. I did the research and came to the conclusion that it was worth the "risk". The team seems solid, regulated, and they are backed by big investors (raised $60 million so far).
Don't listen to the "not your keys not your coins" crowd. Make your own decision. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 12:20:34
I'm holding half my crypto with BlockFi earning 6.2% interest and have the other half on Coinbase for trading. 
I don't care what you think crypto "should" be. You're not the authority of what I want to do with my money.
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:21:34
Hold my crypto with Gemini... get 6.2% interest, 98% of coins are stored in cold storage, fully insured. No hacks, perfect record. Competent owners.
I'll take that bet any day.
6.2% of $100k is $6200 a year. For... doing... nothing...
If Bitcoin goes back to $20k that $6.2k turns into $31k.
@_date: 2019-03-28 11:07:19
Good. 
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:48:29
Thank you!
On the page it says...


So, if I want to withdraw 5k ETH I can do that all at once but then I need to wait 30 more days before I am allowed to withdraw anymore?
5k ETH is currently worth $835,000. Is the withdrawal limit based on USD value or will it always stay at 5k ETH? Say, ETH really takes off and makes it to $5000. Now that's $25 million. Will you allow a $25 million withdrawal?
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:52:59
Coinbase not simple enough?
Hit "buy" to buy.
Hit "sell" to sell.
Real tough.
@_date: 2019-08-27 07:24:59
Is there a limit on how much you can withdraw every day/week/month?
@_date: 2019-12-19 04:09:50


Ah yes, the Bitcoin maximalist starter pack. :D
@_date: 2019-04-06 12:17:35
@_date: 2019-04-14 10:22:16
It will be worth $200k in 3 years.
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:53:00
The coins are stored at Gemini, the most regulated and compliant exchange in crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:03:41
Not even close.
BlockFi is paying 6% a year, Bitconnect was promising 10% a *month*.
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:45:44
Nope, agree with the other guy.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:21:26










Holy shit is this sad.
That guy is a moron.
@_date: 2019-04-06 09:33:59
Trust Wallet has been around for a long time. They got bought out by Binance and it's now their official wallet.
They also support more coins than just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-24 11:23:03
If you lose the private key you lose everything.
Do you really not understand why not everyone is comfortable doing self-custody?
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:25:42
Looks like the graph is showing $100,000, not 10M.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:31:41
Most volume on Coinmarketcap is fake.
This is the real volume.
Coinbase only keeps 2% of their funds in hot wallets (insured), the rest is in cold storage.
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:56:55
Trust Wallet
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:53:52
Which bank lost you 85% last year?
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:44:39
Trust Wallet

@_date: 2019-05-26 09:07:30
It's been working fine. They lowered interest rates on ETH so I removed some of it though.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:45:21
Coinbase is completely safe, just make sure you are using Google Auth 2FA.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:35:08
I watched it live. He was definitely saying it sarcastically.
The clip cuts off on YouTube but then they all started laughing and shaking their heads.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:10:53
lol ok. 
Binance just got hacked for 40 million and Coinbase has never been hacked.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:28:12
So because you're a shit trader no one else should trade?
Ya, ok pal.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:50:58
Coinbase is the second largest in volume behind Binance.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:31:14
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:14:29


lol stfu noob
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:19:50
Yes, and that's why it's an investment not something comparable to a savings account.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:08:04
Do you really not understand the chances of Coinbase getting hacked are infinitesimally small?
They have insurance to cover loss and they are worth over $10 billion dollars.
Coinbase is the best thing to happen to crypto, regardless of what the peanut gallery here says.
@_date: 2019-05-24 10:24:26


This isn't possible with 2FA and address whitelisting. 
Even if they somehow got into your account it takes 48 hours to add a new withdrawal address. You would get an email saying this and it would give you enough time to contact them and have your account locked.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:19:54
If you're going to use Gemini you might as well use BlockFi (who stores your coins in Gemini's cold storage) and get 6% interest a year.
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:01:51
That's what the insurance is for.
