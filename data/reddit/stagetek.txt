The first couple times I tried it, the transaction ended up being about 31,000bytes.

It does not seem to have a transaction ID.  The transaction hasn't shown up yet on blockchain.info.

Using Multibit for OSX.  
No, when I first made the transaction, it didn't show up on the blockchain. 
Currently it's been about 4 days, and the wallet shows no balance, and also show's the transaction as unconfirmed.  Seems as though the coins are floating around somewhere.  At this point I'm waiting for them to be returned to my wallet...

I'm using MultiBit for OS X.  I just bought a Trezor which is why I was transfering...

Ya I think you hit the nail on the head.  It's been 11 days and the transaction never confirmed, and my coins haven't been returned to the sending wallet.

The Multibit wallet shows the transaction Status as " Seen by 9 peers.  Pending/Unconfirmed"

That's part of the problem, the transaction isn't making it to the blockchain, so I have no transaction ID to post...  :(

Address is 1AGFZDng6UXNPijHatvDQk3cfN3zsACkf4
There is a transaction on there for .01 that I used as a test.  That went through fine.
The last one I tried to send was .5 coins.  Transaction size is 1558 bytes.  The wallet software says it's been seen by 3 peers, but still unconfirmed.  That was about 18 hours ago.
When I try to view the transaction on blockchain.info, it says that it can't be found.  It seems like the wallet isn't transmitting the transaction onto the blockchain?

Also, not sure if this matters, but it is a fairly good size transaction.  30,547 bytes.  This was a wallet that held proceeds from mining, so there are a ton of small inputs of .01 coin over a few years....

Looks like the transaction isn't shown on the network yet.  The only transaction shown on that address is the .01 I sent a few days ago as a test...

It appears that the wallet software never sent the transaction out to the network.  There is no transaction ID and it's not on the blockchain.info still show's a balance in that wallet.

Worth a shot!

Yes, you'll get the .8 BTgold.  Whatever you have in that wallet at the time of the split, you'll get in BCgold.

I mine, but it's only really a hobby.  I'm fairly certain I pay more for electricity at this point then I generate in bitcoin...  I have a couple of the 180GH units online, and only generate about $5-6 worth every couple of weeks....

Originally I paid about 200 each for them, but I've had them for a while, so they've been paid off for a good bit of time...I got my money out of them thankfully...
