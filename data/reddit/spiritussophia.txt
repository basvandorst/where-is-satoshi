Oh what about the fact that Light, Electricity, Magnetism, and Heat are all facets of one Substance? And that all four of these can be used to power anything? Can you explain how to live off grid and build a house? Oh I did that already. What about how to grow a garden in the desert? I have also done that one. Oh and don't forget to mention the fact that I have been to most states and can tell you much about most places and locations? You sir are an idiot

I am actually a male. And although yes I would be profiting from this I would also be helping to introduce Natural medicines to people who are otherwise ignorant.

Do you know about the importance of Light? Do you know how to produce Electricity? Do you know how the circuitry in your electronics work? Do you know the entire periodic table? Do you know the structure of the atom and how elements bond? Do you know what sub-atomic particles are? I could explain all of this and more. I am very proficient in the knowledge of Science. I have been studying Science and Religion for 9 years now. I know Arabic and Hebrew. I have read all religious scriptures and now many Occult texts. So please. Explain to me how your knowledge is superior. And then once you can do this maybe I can learn even more from you in order to add to my already astounding bank of knowledge. Please. Talk shit to somebody who is ignorant. I can explain oxidation. I can explain how certain plants with anti-oxidant properties act in the body to eliminate disease. So please explain to me your superior knowledge?

What is quackery? Natural Medicine is very beneficial and its effects are very well documented.

But what you are not taking into account is that these "modern evidence-based scientific medicines" have a much larger negative side effect list than Herbs which act in the same way toward healing. If you say there is no such thing as natural medicine it is because you are absolutely ignorant to facts relating to such. Do a Google search. Research. You clearly have no idea what you are talking about.

Fresh out of prison? I have been out of prison for approximately 5 years now. And I study science and the occult both. Occult actually is science if you understood what that meant. I do not seek job prospects and slave work. What do you know about science? What type of scientific education do you have?? Please share.

How am I a scammer? Who would be getting scammed? If people decide to help me by donating to me how can that be scamming them?
