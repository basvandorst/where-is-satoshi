Definitely! But also, if trading to fiat is the best use of BTC in 2058, I'll have misjudged crypto....

Fantastic right here. Lottery winners win more, donate less, and end up miserable.

If it wasn’t clear, that’s essentially what I meant.

Easy enough to explain.
There was a headline about bitcoin finally tanking, and the details were "down to 7600 from 7900", and that reminded me that I wanted some bitcoin, so I bought some bitcoin. And decided to let y'all know.
Mystery solved!

A substantial amount? A, say, living wage?
Pretty hard for a lot of Americans.

Always a good goal! But don't forget, your income is your greatest short-term wealth builder, so balance your time between watching crypto and furthering your skills/career...!

Not sure how “babysteps of progress” implies “this single $300 crypto purchase will increase in value to the point where my grandchildren are impacted in a significant financial way.”
But sure, I hope they’ll see the value in this initial gesture, and I hope that I continue to make similar investments into cryptocurrency which do, ultimately, have a net positive financial impact on my family.

I hadn't considered that aspect yet. I think I will do this. Thanks!
Is there an estimated timeline for how long a 500gb storage will be sufficient to house the blockchain?

Did you read the paper?

“Most people”

175 days later, we are still interested.

170 days later, I’m $1200 in and after averaging only about 2% down at the moment. Think it’s been a good choice.

45 days later, any closer??
