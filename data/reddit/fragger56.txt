Remember 2013? when BTC went from $230 to $60 in April dropping 70% of its value, then hit $1150 in November before dropping 50% again?
Or how every year there is a slump around now.
IMO we are just in a correction from the Futures markets overhyping BTC, since all futures trading is just a legalized Ponzi anyway.

I never said anything about the legitimacy of crypto, you are putting words in my mouth.
Nor did I say shit about contracts defaulting
I just pointed out the fact that its all bullshit.
With crypto its just a more even playing field for now due to the amount of competition going on and general lack of regulation.
You can try to divert and redirect all you want, but it doesn't change the fact that IPOs in the end are run for the same reasons as ICOs, albeit with more oversight to weed out the total scams rather than requiring the guy investing to have some braincells...
Or the fact that most of the big banks never really got punished for all the shit leading up to the bailouts.
The whole goddamn system is corrupt, end of story.
Anyway, I'm done here, you'll end up kicking your own ass when crypto based transactions are as common or more common than credit/debit/gift card transactions are now.
No point in wasting more of my time on someone who will just divert and move the goal posts while jumping to incorrect conclusions.

Says the guy who wants to cash it in for Fiat that isn't even worth the paper its printed on.
dips bring the best trolls out of the woodwork...
I'm also gonna guess that you bought futures on CME, bet short on those and also think futures trading is a good idea, rather than a legalized ponzi scheme with the main design intent of artifically controling the price of the market.

Not whatever is in yours making you think an asset class that is mainly used to con money out of the hands of the less affluent is a positive.
I mean there totally hasn't been a history of big banks and investment groups manipulating the market prices of stuff like silver and gold by buying futures contracts and then buying up the actual commodities at the last minute.
Like JPMorgan, which totally didn't get sued for this 10 years ago...
Oh wait, they did and the cases are still going through appeals...
So with that said I'd like some of whatever they happen to be putting in your water that lets you ignore the corrupt reality we live in, cause its gotta be some damn good shit...

Here is my issue with this situation, my understanding is, with how little data can be stored in a BTC TX that the hex encoded files need to be split across many TXs to false accounts and then re-assembled afterwards to get usable files.
This means that whomever rebuilds the files needs to have an ordered list of all the TXs needed for each file.
Where the fuck did the researchers get these lists? unless the people who "uploaded" the questionable material to the blockchain were either dumb as rocks, or did this as a plant and used sequential addresses or they were given them after someone's computer got seized, I don't see how anyone would be able to actually find the questionable content on the blockchain.
In short, yea its easy to ID the stuff after the fact, but without the TX list or knowing the "uploaders" address, its just random data, so IMO unless they got the TX lists from court proceedings, this smells like a plant, unless I'm missing something.
Also encoding files like this could be applied to any form of media, text or video, and by extension someone could use a word and page list to build CP images out of the text of the bible if they wanted to...
Which makes this angle of attack pretty bullshit.

Also you have no idea what you are talking about, there were only 200k BTC held by the Mt.Gox trust, of which 166k still remain, so 34k were sold.
Try checking your numbers and facts before you make yourself look like an idiot/nocoiner again.

With BTC prices where they are and the number of coins already sold, the trustee has likely already recuperated the fiat value of the accounts at the time of bankruptcy.
at 100 BTC a day that would be around 6 months.
also rates above 100 BTC a day would work as well, its just that 1k+ a day is definitely gonna affect the market negatively. The guy was selling multiple thousands in a day...
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:18:33
Except he didn't sell slowly, he sold in chunks of multiple thousands of BTC crashing the market each time.
If he really was looking out for the benefit of the trust/people owed by Mt.Gox as he states he would be selling more often at a lower volume, say like 100 BTC a day spread over multiple exchanges as to not crash the market.

My Windows CE based HTC TyTn from 2006 and the other early windows based smartphones would like to talk to you about revisionist history and claiming that the iphone came first even though it came out in 2007.
Apple just took what was on the market and made it easy to use for the non-techie, they didn't invent shit.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:28:00
Just keep twisting the words of those around you and moving the goalposts, that'll totally win you the discussion
1st gen iphones (hell all early smartphones) are useless compared to actual modern phones and my TyTn had google maps, e-mail, skype, 3d games and most of the functionality as my current phone, albeit data was slow and the software sucked, though all those things are still in use today.
So much for the lack of standards...
Apple just makes things shiny and simple, for people who cannot be arsed to understand the equipment they use and they always do so after someone has done most of the difficult groundwork for them.

Wouldn't the re-hashing of an old article combined with the timing constitute stock bashing?
It amazes me how much baseless speculation and total bullshit the "financial news" companies are allowed to post up without getting nailed by the SEC for stock manipulation...
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:25:00
Well, we better ban the internet now because all the things you mentioned exist on the internet in forms that cannot be easily deleted by the authorities...
Better ban computers too just to be safe.
Hell, why don't we just nuke ourselves from orbit, gotta think of all the future generations of children we'll save from the evil pedos.

The most fucked up thing is, sales of the volumes and prices involved of bitcoin if applied to any other regulated commodity market by the Mt.Gox trustee would probably lead to a SEC investigation and probably fines and Jailtime for the person involved.
But since its BTC its totally fine to crash the market and then pocket the remaining 150+k BTC after the guy sold the bankruptcy funds for fiat all at once...
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:52:40
You forgot the part where it went up 2000% first before dropping 60%...

Have you read the quotes from RBI?
They literally want to ban existing crypto and create their own.
Indian's banking sector is in shambles and falling apart, yet they want to do this?!
Sounds like they are trying to do everything they can to prevent India from pulling a Venezuela by getting control of crypto before shit implodes.
Not saying its FUD, but I am saying this is sketchy AF.
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:18:46
Well maybe if you guys had the forethought to announce yourselves on popular locations of crypto discussion (like here on reddit) before buying a domain related to an existing crypto wallet and setting up a half complete website that raises even more red flags to the community...
