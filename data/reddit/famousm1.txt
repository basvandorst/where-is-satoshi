NK has recently been saying it's open to talks and stepping down it's aggression. It's almost as if Kim Jong Un realized his threats to the US, that went unresponded to in the Obama days, are finally met with someone crazy enough to actually strike him and destroy NK; standing up to the bully.

The widespread United States voted for him, the only reason California went Democrat is because of LA. Outside of that bubble, to everyday citizens, he is simply the President and probably like him a lot for lowering taxes/creating jobs/ wiping out ISIS/etc he's done a lot of good and from my viewpoint as a studying biologist, I fail to see anything negative that he's done

So by holding the mnemonic phrase of a blockchain wallet, do you hold the private key? 
       
Would someone create a paper wallet seed the same way they would create a paper address on an air-gapped computer?

Is this accurate or sarcasm? Genuine question..
        
So someone with a blockchain wallet and the 12 word backup, has complete control over the wallet? I know you can't download the private key from the blockchain wallet.. I thought it was the same as keeping bitcoins on an exchange

So a hardware wallet is basically a paper wallet that is also not connected to the internet but creates it own seed/keys unlike a paper wallet. 
       
So it's basically a very simple offline computer.. I never thought of it like that

But the issue comes from return on investment. Is buying $600 of Bitcoin worth gambling that Bitcoin will increase 10x within a reasonable amount of time, just to make $5400? 
          
As of right now, you need to invest at least a few thousand to see good investments imo
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:28:56
Has anyone else pointed out that "address" is misspelled?
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:57:24
It's usually recommended that you shouldn't invest what you can't afford to lose. 
          
My line of thinking is that, given the difficulty and time it will most likely take to reach a Bitcoin value of $65k(10x now), will the $4500 someone makes from a $500 investment be worth it and or could it have been better utilized during the time it took to reach that value?
         
No one knows where the roof for the value is and in retrospect, the value has risen 10x this year alone, so there's no reason to say that 10x more will absolutely take a significantly long amount of time, it could happen next year. In that case, I think it's a good investment. If it takes 20-30 years to jump to 65k then I'd say probably not.
         
I don't know the data behind the market though so I'm not even able to estimate what a reasonable price increase given realistic market cap increase

I signed up for coinbase when it opened 5 years ago and they were giving out .1btc ($1) as incentive for registration. I found that .1 in my email about a year ago and used the $270 to buy altcoins that I lost all value on. Now the Bitcoin is worth $1100+, hodl

I've read about people predicting the last bitcoins to be mined in the year 2140, but I ask if halvening can happen sooner because I'm wondering if it's possible it will come quicker than we think and if we will see the last bitcoins be mined in our lifetime
       
From my understanding, with a constant fresh supply of mined bitcoins, people are able to continue selling bitcoins, but after the last one's are mined is when the scarcity property takes effect and I wonder how that will affect price stability
