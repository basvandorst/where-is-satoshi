That's amazingly accurate!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:16:09
Right, but doesn't that still requires some external factor to move the price to the stop and limit values? And it more or less followed the price in other exchanges that were still open, like bitstamp.

You equate "events" with "major news", I don't. Market-shifting events might be government decisions, pump &amp; dump social media efforts, something someone said in a bitcointalk or reddit post that caused a butterfly effect, people reacting to whales, anything really.


No, the price graph is plotting human emotion. TA takes the price graph and treats it as if it somehow contained everything that went into it, the whole boiling mess of human emotions that produced that price, without any loss. But the price graph doesn't retain all of that, it's a very lossy process. TA doesn't try to model the underlying chaos to predict human emotional reaction to future events. It merely looks at the graph and tries to find patterns. Good effort, but I don't think it's possible. There's seldom patterns to events, and when there is, I don't think it's something that can be gleaned from just a price.

Google gets its ["btc to usd"]( price from the coinbase API which is still working. I'm watching the order book on cryptowat.ch. It's calmed down now, but that was some crazy ride.
I think coinbase enters "maintenance mode" automatically when the price starts fluctuating too violently, as a way to avoid abuse maybe?

Year-long trends with things like bitcoin? No, I don't believe there is one trend spanning years. I believe there are hour-, day- and maybe week-long trends based on events, news about those events and simple panic reactions to perceived trends. Longer than that, old trends fade and new trends take over. I don't think that last year's peak followed by a drop followed by a higher peak is a predictor of a similar sequence in the future. The only year-long trend I beleive in is that adoption of crytocurrencies is growing and will continue to grow, but this says very little about price and which cryptocurrency will dominate.

You can implement your own ram-based system with a change log synchronically written to disk and an asynchronous process that reads the log and keeps a disk image of the index to be read after a power failure, or have the ram index dump periodically and asynchronously to disk and have the delta dealt with on startup from the log. It's not that hard and it boosts performance like crazy.

Not a moronic question at all. The best and more robust way is the following, which you should repeat on each site where you have 2-factor authentication (2FA) enabled - hopefully all of them:
- Log into the site using the current 2FA code.
- Disable 2FA on the site (you'll probably need to enter the 2FA code again).
- Once you did the previous step (make sure it's disabled by logging out and in again), remove the site from the authenticator list.
- Re-enable 2FA on the website, but:
- Before scanning the qr-code with the phone, make a screen-grab of the qr-code.
- Now you can either store the image in an encrypted file (a password-protected zip file or a truecrypt volume are fine, but make sure you make a backup of that). Alternatively you can print it, delete the file, and later store the paper in a safebox.
- Use your backup qr-code (the image file or the printed paper) to scan it with google authenticator. This ensures that your backup works.
Now you have your 2FA and a backup you can scan with a new phone. All necessary info is in the qr-code, it doesn't depend on the phone, the image alone is enough.

Assuming gox is really starting to allow withdrawals, I think there will be two forces moving the market: 
- confidence recovery will push the price up.
- arbitrage will push the price down. 
I think the down force will be significantly less than the up force, for two reasons: 
- gox said it would only open gradually, which means other markets won't be flooded.
- the price of gox-btc will shoot up way faster than the price in other exchanges because everyone trapped in gox is desperate to get out.
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:53:29
Maybe I wasn't clear, but I don't think we are disagreeing.
Those who have btc in gox will transfer them out as soon as possible and *might* want to sell them on other exchanges, but many won't, and in any case it won't be a run because gox will only allow limited withdrawal.
On the other hand, those who have usd in gox will buy btc as soon as they realize they can get btc out. Since there's no limit to how much or when they can buy, and the more they wait the more expensive gox-btc will become, the price inside gox will rise very fast once the news breaks that the gates are open.

I don't understand how history repeats itself. I think that is an illusion. History goes forward, circumstances evolve. You can find patterns in history but then you can find patterns in anything. I think saying that bitcoin will go up this year because it went up last year is sheer numerology, drawing meaningless lines in charts. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, that's clear, but the future of bitcoin depends on future events, not on the past.

You seem to believe that bitcoin is following some underlying bubble behaviour that can be modeled and predicted. I think that is similar to numerology or astrology. 
Bitcoin's price is governed by a set of circumstances that evolve minute by minute. They don't repeat themselves. The resulting price may show similar patterns at different moments in time, but our pattern-seeking brains going "hey look, it's happening again!" doesn't mean history is actually repeating itself.
Bitcoin may very well be overshadowed by some other blockchain-based thing and disapear forever. Or some startup may build the killer app, or the chinese exchanges may manipulate the price like Mt.Gox did, and we'll see prices above 10K. Or a million other things may happen. The technology is here to stay. Bitcoin? Who knows.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:47:27
I've seen this recommended several times. It's solid advice IFF you expect the price to go up in the long term. Otherwise it's terrible advice. You could lose your life savings doing that.

You should get a bitcoin wallet on your own computer, encrypt your wallet (the wallet software has that option), transfer all your bitcoins to your wallet, then store the wallet.dat file in a couple of safe places, preferably encrypted (like a truecrypt volume or a password protected zip file). There's a lot about bitcoin security both in and elsewhere.

That's true, no arguments there. Bitcoin is still way riskier than dollars, which is why I only invested as much as I'm comfortable losing. 
On the other hand, I bought BTC at $87 and at $166, while my dollars lost a couple of % points in the past year. Of course BTC might as well be worth $1 today, so I'm not lamenting not investing more.

I agree that interference limits people's ability to make voluntary transactions, but that is not always bad. Sometimes the free market allows abuse that ends up hurting people. I honestly can't see how you can argue against minimum wage with a straight face, especially after you used slavery as a clear example of a bad thing. The free market is not the cure for everything, it creates some problems that you simply can't ignore.
For example, regional airlines in the US are paying atrocious wages to highly trained and experienced pilots (20K-30K), driving would-be pilots away which results in an artificial shortage of pilots and consequent grounding of airplanes, hurting businesses and towns that depend on accessibility. You could argue that the free market determined that these towns are redundant and should not exist, but that would be asinine. The problem is the airline's ability to exploit those pilots, not some intrinsic lack of worth of those towns.
The housing boom was caused by unchecked greed, not by inflation or government intervention. If anything, regulation could have helped prevent it. There are plenty of examples of free market causing havoc, followed by regulation to avoid repeating it. Of course regulation is limiting, but it's usually the lesser of two evils.
I agree that the free market is the most efficient way to allocate resources, but sometimes efficiency is not what you should strive for. Everyone needs education, health care and security. Placing those on the hands of the free market ensures that only the wealthy can have them, while everyone else gets no education or has to get into huge debts, gets no health care or has to declare bankruptcy after a serious illness... and you'd get a dystopia if the only security available was for hire. Those three things simply can't be left to the free market, they are basic rights that *have* to be guaranteed to every human being, even if doing so allocates resources inefficiently.




Uhm. No. It's exactly the opposite. People don't want to mindlessly spend their money (not smart people anyway), they want to invest it to not only keep their worth but to increase it. So they very much invest in starting businesses. You even said it yourself:


Forced? Not interested? Nobody ever said "damn, I had to invest in this crappy company, I wish there was a way to avoid doing that!"




Seriously? This is the best example you could come up with? A group that is loosely defined as "everyone living under the authority's radar in this huge area"? If all anarchism can hope for is a primitive society, I think you are underscoring the importance of structure and organization. I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in the middle ages. It wasn't as romantic as you might think. These "zomians" are benefiting from the civilization around them, just like anti-vaxers are free-riding herd immunity.




Ok, that is entertaining, but also awfully naive: 
The example of a company and an employee who don't agree on the payment. He says that the company could not simply go to a judge who always rules in their favor because the employee would not agree. Ok, let's say he doesn't agree. What now? Is the company suddenly forced to go to whatever judge the employee wants? It'd just say "sorry, this is the only judge we are going to accept." What now? Anything the employee tries to do will be met with the company's deep pockets. And they would have an incentive to go overboard, just to set a precedent so no other employee attempts any such shenanigans in the future.
My TV is stolen. I wouldn't be able to just hire an enforcement company to break down the guys door and get me my TV back, they'd ask for a ruling. But why would they do that? It's only in their interest to do that if they want to have a reputation of being honest and fair and straight. But in that market, you'd also have players that want the opposite reputation, because there'd be people willing to pay to do dirty jobs. And he mentions receipts? Why would anyone have receipts? To show to which IRS? 
And I stopped watching there. He doesn't makes sense, he assumes the scenario it tries to replace. I fundamentally disagree that the law is the hard part but enforcement is the easy part. I think it's the other way around.

I only care about the financial establishment's opinion in as much as some key figures might affect the future of bitcoin, but I don't have anything against the financial establishment. I worked for them, I use their instruments, I have quite a lot of money in their system. 
I have bitcoins because it's a crazy cool technology and so far a great investment. In fact, I'm learning a lot about the financial establishment by playing with trading strategies. I also don't think bitcoin will replace the fiat currencies. So I don't fall under your generalization. And I'm sure a lot people here also don't fall under it. 
That's what I'm arguing about. You're generalizing. You can't put a label like that on a large group of people without coming across as short sighted and narrow minded, especially when you hide behind a definition.

Maybe I misinterpreted who your intended audience is, but I myself have no idea what you mean by "painting the tape", and I suspect many people would need an explanation of the following terms:
- pump and dump
- shorts and stops
- vulnerable order book
- consumption of liquidity
- vacuum in the offer stack
- lifting the offer stack
- support
- post rip
Of course many (if not all) of these things are "trading 101", but given how fast cryptocurrencies are drawing people into trading who have no previous experience or knowledge (like I was), you might want to explain it so they can actually understand what you're saying.

My position is that it's a very inconvenient way to store value. Also, I don't know where I'd buy it without getting ripped off. I don't know anyone who has gold. People try to get USD (or USD valued goods) more than anything.
Experience shows that if you have USD you are not only protected from inflation, recession, crashes and defaults, but it also creates great opportunities at those times.

@_date: 2014-02-18 13:50:29
Wow, I didn't expect that! Congratulations on thinking it through and changing your mind! I still disagree with you though, but now I think we can actually talk.
When you say that Bernanke was aware of the problems of the system he lived in, I agree completely. They all know that inflation takes value out of your savings. It's a very simple concept and nobody says that doesn't happen. But most economist also think that a low level of inflation is necessary to grow an economy, and that a growing economy allows people to thrive. You can see this concept debated all the time in it's a complex issue and it's not automatically evident who is right. Personally I think the argument against deflation is pretty solid.
You would be right to consider Bernanke evil if there was a better alternative and he chose not to implement that alternative. Many people in the past would have said "sure there is a better alternative: read Marx!" But by now we all know that most if not all attempts to implement his ideas failed miserably and that capitalism has worked out better, even with its glaring problems (mainly inequality).
You might also be tempted to say "sure there is a better alternative: Bitcoin!" To that, the answer is no, at the time Bernanke was the chairman it was not available. Even now it's still not really available to the FED. It's a fascinating experiment, it has a lot of potential, but at this point it's nothing more than an experiment in its infancy.
You could also consider Bernanke evil if he manipulated the economy for personal gain. That happens quite frequently in many countries. In my country there are, if I remember correctly, 11 members of government under investigation for becoming rich though illegal use of their power. That is definitely evil, and if found guilty they should go to jail. Bernie Madoff did something like that and he is in jail. Bernanke, though, didn't do that as far as we know.
You mention that he caused massive inflation. You consider 1.5% anual inflation massive? Come on. Where I live it's around 30% and although it's very high I hesitate to call it massive, after all we did have 35% *per month* at one time not too far ago.  Maybe you are talking about Quantitative Easing? If that's the case I understand your confusion, I have a hard time understanding how QEs aren't causing inflation, but it's evident that they're not, and more knowledgeable people can explain why it hasn't happened.

Bitcoin is not a way to move USD or any other currency out of the country (the main thing the government worries about) and for AFIP to go after tax evasion through bitcoin it would have to be legislated first. I doubt that will happen in the near future.

The only important thing in that document is that they (presumably) lost 700K coins, which would have come out anyway.

Fire everyone, put somebody with a good track record on top of it, start from scratch. What's valuable there is the user base, nothing else. They key point is if anyone wants to buy the liability.

You said it yourself: gox problems are exclusive to gox, so why are poeple selling on other exchanges? 
Because of lack of confidence in the whole thing (which doesn't make sense since this is a gox problem), or in anticipation of gox opening the gates causing selling pressure on every other exchange (a self-fulfilling, fear-fueled run), or some other reason. 
It may be irrational, but fear and speculation are natural.

It's arguable that without inflation there's no growth. If low inflation is the best way to stimulate an economy (do you know of better ways?), and a growing economy is good for most people, it's debatable that inflation is intrinsically bad.


Do you have examples of successful country-sized decentralized economies? Assuming you have, how did they do it? If you don't, how do you suppose this might have been done?


Although you might call both "centrally planned economies", there's a huge distance between capitalism and communism, you can't just lump them together and call both equally bad.


That is demonstrably untrue in certain specific cases: education and health. The US is a perfect example of that not working. Europe is a great example of the opposite working well. I'm not so sure about security, there are good and bad examples on both sides. For the rest of economic activities, I'm with you.


Again, do you have examples of country-sized populations successfully running without some kind of police? I'd love for that to be the case, but I suspect your ideal scenario of a free market, which requires private property, wouldn't work without some assurance that people can't simply take your private property and run with it. Also, assuming you'd advocate for a police force but eliminate taxes and laws that could throw you in jail for not paying them, who would pay for that police and who would control them?


You're right. It's not easy to implement a change that makes a whole institution redundant, especially if that same institution is the one charged with deciding that change. But history shows that change can happen and better systems tend to replace worse systems over time, even if the road is bumpy and twisted.

You seem to have bought Gox's argument that the fault is in bitcoin itself and that the bitcoin devs are the ones charged with fixing it. 
That's not the case. The fault is with Gox's own wallet implementation not taking into account the fact that transaction malleability exists. They have to fix their software, as did all other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:12:55
For the reasons I outline in my post: A. it's possibly a security risk to prove that they have the coins while they are the biggest target, and B. they can profit much more from a widely fluctuating market than from a relatively stable one. 
And I don't know what kind of guy this Mark Karpeles is, maybe he's a control freak and an asshole that doesn't take advice from anyone and thinks he's always right. 
What I'm saying is that I see people demanding Mt.Gox to prove solvency, when in reality they don't have to. And they may have reasons not to, other than being insolvent.
If they open the gates in the near future, their business is not dead by a long shot. Bitcoin is in its infancy.

I never bought the "this happened before, it will happen again" argument. I don't think investor behavior can be modeled as a simple and predictable system. It ignores the complexity of reality, a reality that evolves and doesn't repeat itself.
The market may move because of news articles, whales, legal decisions, insider deals, bots, software bugs, and a thousand more factors that don't even out and can't be clumped together in one category that can be easily modeled. That way of thinking may have been relevant in the 1930's, but bots and bugs don't follow psychological cycles (to give just one example).
In other words, reduced volatility doesn't predict a big rise just because that's what the graph shows in the past. That's just numerology, the face on mars, jesus on a toast.

You're right that people without income would not be able to participate, but what has happened in many crashing economies is that, while many people lose their jobs, most keep their jobs but high inflation eats their income as fast as they get it. They are desperate to get rid of the fiat and invest it into whatever can keep its value, like bricks and gold. And bitcoin.

Ok, I'll try again with a dbcache=4000 (half my 8GB) and see what happens. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:51:10
OS X 10.10.1. Anyway, it didn't happen again and now, 8 hours later, it's at 14 weeks. The dbcache change seems to have helped. Thanks for that!
Edit: and it just finished. 40 weeks in 13 hours, about 20 days per hour. It would take about 6 days to sync the whole blockchain in this machine (assuming it's linear). Now I'll try with the downloaded bootstrap file, which is three days old, to compare.
Edit2: Starting form the 3-day-old bootstrap file, it took 30 hours to complete. Preliminary conclusion: In a slow machine, the bootstrap file is far better than the "fast" sync.
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:52:47
Thanks, I trust you as much as I trust the bitcointalk poster and I'm already almost done downloading his bootstrap.bin file. If that one fails, I'll try yours.

A complex electronic device is safer than a piece of paper?
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:46:46
I'm one of those people you're talking about. I had moved my bitcoin out of Gox in time, but spent one to buy a number of gox-coins right before the bankruptcy (through an exchange created for that purpose, can't remember the name now).
If I get those coins now, I'll probably sell part of it. Mostly because I think bitcoin is marred with community infighting that hinders its evolution and causes it to be slow or expensive to move around when the volume goes up, limiting its ability to grow. Other coins will eventually take over. Or it may survive for another round and increase in price in spite of these issues (the market is not rational), so I'm holding a part of it just in case.
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:12:33


I never said that. I even explained that I meant slow transaction confirmations last time you made that assertion.


I already said that I'm not paying attention because of all the drama. Both of us are not paying attention it seems. :) 
But now that you mentioned that a lot has been happening lately, I started reading again. Thanks for that!

You can't be saying that paper wallets are write-only... Do you mean that they can be accessed by someone else if you don't put them under strong physical security? I think that is a given: paper wallets and safe deposit boxes go hand-in-hand, no?
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:17:05
I meant slow transaction confirmations. I haven’t been following the latest developments mainly because I got tired of the infighting and inability to move forward, which caused last December’s painfully obvious growth issues where you either paid a very high fee or had to wait a very long time for the transaction to be confirmed. I basically lost interest, I don’t care about soap operas.
@_date: 2016-11-16 22:29:14
Followup: I ran the wallet for about one hour with the configuration suggested. The first hour it got to 38 weeks, then it crashed. After restarting it was back at 40 weeks.
The system was never above 60% load, Bitcoin Core reaches 132% cpu utilization (two cores) max. The fans never spin up meaning the CPU doesn't get hot so I don't think it's throttling.
I guess I'll let it running overnight and see how far it gets in the morning.
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:50:59
You may be right. I believe the sync process is CPU-bound, and I'm using a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5. Maybe that's too slow.
So I'm just about to start the client with the new bootstrap file (after it finishes decompressing). Is that still going to be slower than letting it sync from 40 weeks ago?
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:50:46


I agree but I worry that since last December's ATH bitcoin is now more widely known and almost everyone heard of it, bitcoin is now in the spotlight and its performance is critical to its long-term success. Lightning needs to be widely adopted before the next bull run, otherwise the fees and slow confirmations are what bitcoin will be known for and adoption will be impacted.


What I've seen is that bitcoin gets adopted by the larger public when inflation gets so high that even a highly volatile instrument like bitcoin is preferable to more traditional alternatives, or to overcome government-imposed limitations to how people can use their money (buying foreign currency made illegal, for example). In otherwise uncertain economies people become risk-averse and get out of the stock market and other volatile investments, storing cash or investing in real estate.
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:55:16
I didn’t get scared. I said it clearly: I got tired of the drama and lost interest. I’m still holding, but I’ll probably sell some if during the next bull run fees and confirmation times still go up as much as they did last time. I also hold some alts like ETH, but I wouldn’t call them shitcoins. Not getting suckered into ICOs though.
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:08:08
Not trusting your BTC to third parties doesn't necessarily imply cold storage. You can run your own wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:20:43
Completely agree with you on that. I'm just one person, my knowledge of bitcoin is outdated because I stopped following after all the blocksize drama. 
I'm interested in your opinion about the future of bitcoin. Other than the BCH vs BTC mud slinging, has the community managed to tone it down? Is there a consensus on how to scale bitcoin? Has SegWit been widely adopted? How does the Lightning network come into play?

You're getting downvoted but you are actually right. Most Argentinians have no idea what bitcoin is, wouldn't know how to buy it if they knew, and have absolute (and justified) faith in holding US dollars. That's really why the unofficial dollar is so much higher than the official one. Market pressure.
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:07:07
They didn't touch the safe boxes. Also, there was no "haircut", there were restrictions on how much you could extract per day but your money was still there. Even if you had dollars you could opt to have them converted into bonds and if you did, you would get the value back albeit at a later date (years). Not saying it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the same.

@_date: 2017-05-11 22:27:25
Yep. I did that a while ago and it worked quite well. Had to tweak some config parameter of the core client to make the sync go faster on an underpowered laptop but that was it.

I'm not sure **all** news has always been propaganda (Andreas is right that some news outlets used to have credibility because of their fact-checking) but I've been aware that you can't trust **most** news since I saw what they printed regarding events that I was personally involved in. They got it wrong every single time. Not just wrong, but intentionally misleading. And this is not just in the last few years; I became aware of this the 90's, more than 20 years ago.

@_date: 2017-07-15 11:24:18
Thanks, I'll try that. Seems strange that reducing the number of connections makes it go faster... I wonder what would happen if Bram Cohen takes a look at the protocol... ;)
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:19:04
Yep, this was the issue. I didn't know maxconnections affected incomming, while the bitcoin-qt client only shows outgoing. I can't use bitcoind directly so I can't run the getinfo command. In conclusion everything was working, I just didn't interpret the reported number of connections correctly.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:14:41
The client will verify the chain as soon as I'm done downloading it. If it's an altered version it will get rejected. If it's an internally consistent but completely fabricated chain (all 135 GB of it, quite an effort), it won't accept any new blocks from the network (and it won't have my coins in it). 
In any case that can't happen if the clients implement their own torrent-like protocol, because for a malicious file to get accepted, every client you connect to would need to be compromised, which could be made statistically as hard as a 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:00:01
Sure, the verification needs to happen sequentially, but you can (as I'm doing) download the whole chain as a movie and then do the verification block by block once it's sitting in local storage.
Downloading and verifying in lockstep makes sense when you're helping the network verify the latest block and you're otherwise up-to-date, but for the "bootstrap" use case download and verification are independent steps and should happen separately to allow for a more efficient download protocol.
For simplicity the client uses the sync protocol to download the whole thing but it's not the best approach. It works and it's simple but it's terribly slow and super disk intensive to the point of causing unnecessary failures.
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:11:39
Right, bittorrent is faster because it can accept arbitrary fragments so it can get them in parallel. But why can't the blockchain be downloaded in a similar way and then verified in sequence? The use case of people downloading from scratch (or from far enough back) should be handled differently than keeping a blockchain synced with the rest of the network one block at a time. I understand it's simpler and it worked well enough back when the blockchain was a couple GBs, but now it's a real problem. I guess there's more pressing issues right now, ha!
Anyway, I skimmed the log file and only failed connections are logged, so I couldn't find a good peer in there. In the end I found the gdrive file mentioned [here]( which is only a month old and it's going to take about two hours to download plus a few hours to sync from there. Good enough.
By the way, knowing Bram I was sure he would be involved with some blockchain so I looked for it and found him talking on [Steal This Show]( Listening to it while I wait. :)
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:57:21
Yeah, that's in the US.
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:15:59
Thanks, I had seen that post by Pieter Wuille but didn't read it carefully enough. Turns out I had everything working correctly.
But this is a mac and installing bitcoind is a nightmare (nothing I tried works) so I use the bitcoin-qt client and it wasn't clear to me that it only shows outgoing connections, which are limited to 8 no matter what, and is unaffected by the maxconnections parameter.
I wanted to increase connections in an attempt to reduce sync time after having my blockchain corrupted by someone pulling the USB-connected external drive while syncing the last few days. Sync time is estimated to be 3 days even though it downloaded all headers first (which as far as I understand means that it doesn't need to verify every block), and both my CPU and bandwidth are idle.
I will get back to the old trusted method of downloading an almost up-to-date blockchain through bittorrent and completing the sync from there.
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:49:37
Exactly. I had forgotten about that, but it's a compounding factor in my skepticism regarding news outlets' accuracy in general.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:49:58

Sure, but he did say that he implemented pruning as per the white paper. At least that’s what I understood. Anyway, hopefully someone will eventually make the change and put up a pull request. It’ll be interesting to see the discussion around it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:08:03
That's a great tip, thanks! I'll move the chainstate to the SSD and point to it with a symlink. Hopefully bitcoin-qt won't reject that. I just test it on the linux box and it bitcoind didn't complain.
The dilemma now is: do I stop bitcoin-qt and risk having to start from scratch a third time, or do I wait till it's finished (currently at 75%)? It may finish in anywhere between 3 days and 8 weeks (that's the range of predictions I've seen today alone). 
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:16:43
I guess they went for safety. If they implement satoshi's proposed pruning and they get it wrong somehow, the blockchain is fucked.

Slow spinning disk unfortunately (5400 rpm) over USB 3. The local disk is SSD but there’s no way I can make that much space on it. I may consider buying a larger one anyway, or running a pruned node.
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:58:25
Yeah, my idea was to set up the crontab line to run once a day.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:48:14
Yes, a permissions issue sounds right. The two drives have different filesystems (HDFS+ and NTFS) and I was running the two nodes on different OSes (Mac &amp;  linux). Suspecting linux doesn't like NTFS too much, I since reformatted that drive to Ext4, and will move the node over to that machine once it's fully sync'd. I also bought an Ext4 driver (Paragon) for the Mac just in case. 
I'm thinking of running a script on crontab that compares bitcoin-cli getblockcount with  and if it's up to date (meaning it's healthy) stops the node, rsync's to a backup dir and restarts the node. Not RAID but should be enough.
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:54:38
I think you meant “can’t “.  But that’s not true, nodes don’t reindex every time you stop and restart them. Plus I’ve seen it work once already when it was NTFS.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:18:14
I know that, I’ve been running a full node on and off for years. But this time it’s decided to test my patience.

@_date: 2018-12-15 10:26:18
Nice work! I will re-copy the blocks directory and see if that's the issue. In a few hours I'll report back. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-13 08:27:41
I just bit the bullet and stopped it, moved the chainstate to ssd and symlinked to it, and restarted.
It's currently doing 8% per hour and climbing, it'll be done in 2 hours. I'm tempted to start from zero just to see how fast the whole blockchain syncs now. :)
You're a lifesaver. THANKS!
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:13:36
Ok, I'm back. I copied everything from scratch, with both drives connected to the PI and using a simple cp -r. Started bitcoind with -debug because if it failed I wanted to see what path the code was taking, but of course now **it worked** and I'm left in the dark. :)
Anyway, your suggestion to verify the files was the ticket. Thanks for that! 
I will now figure out why rsync is not copying the files as I expected it to. But the node is running.
@_date: 2018-12-12 08:36:55

I see. Safety would be ensured by having nodes gradually migrate to the new version, where if something bad happens everyone can simply refer to the still running full nodes, and by the fact that anything relatively recent would still be there.
Forensic analysis of the blockchain would become a problem though, as forensic service providers would need to ensure the full blockchain is preserved, full copies would become "precious" and fraudsters would try to muddle the waters with forged but plausible blockchains (a lot of work would need to be done to produce one, but far less than to forge the entire blockchain, if I understand correctly).
Anyway, I was looking for discussions on the matter and found [this one]( where Craig Wright says they implemented that in BSV. Not sure if any other blockchain has done so.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:26:22
Yeah, I expected to find that too, but it seems to start midway:




 
I don't have a logrotate on it, so I'm not sure why the start of the log is missing. There's a setting that reduces the log file on restart, but it should have the whole current log... Maybe it's further down the file. I'll look for it.
Right, it's further down:






Anyway, it's not really downloading the blocks again, it's just verifying them, which takes the same time.

@_date: 2018-12-15 10:25:01
I think that run was on just the blocks and chainstate dirs, no conf file. I have a config that's appropriate for the PI but it makes no difference.
I just did some changes and things are getting weird. I switched from rsyncing through samba to using it properly with rsyncd. Either way rsync reported that the chainstate dir was the same on both disks.
I then connected the mac drive to the PI and ran the sha256sum on both chainstate dirs... and every file was different. :/
I removed the PI version of it, copied the mac chainstate dir to the PI drive, ran the checksum again and this time they matched.
Connected the mac drive to the mac again, ran the rsync with -n (dry-run) and it reports that it would copy every file!
Anyway, rsync issues aside, I started bitcoind on the PI and it still fails the same exact way. So the chainstate contents is not the issue. It has to be something else.
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:29:19

I kind of presumed rsync would take care of that. I started running it with -ar but that borked the ownership as the PI drive is mounted on the mac through samba and the user ids don't match. I also copied the files directly by connecting the two drives to the PI, so I find it hard to believe the files are not the same. But you're right, I will run a checksum and report back.
 


True, I was just trying random stuff, thinking that maybe permissions were the issue, like ssh that needs specific permissions on the .ssh dir. I'm currently using 700 and 600, only opening it to 777 for the rsync because of the aforementioned user id mismatch, and didn't bother setting up rsyncd and an ssh key on the PI. I re-run chown and chmod after the rsync to get everything back to pi:pi and 700/600, but there's a window where everything is wide open. I'm not forwarding anything on the router and have upnp turned off so the risk is not large, but I will install rsyncd and connect as pi later today.


Yes, the drive came like that but I switched to Ext4 because of the speed and I wanted the PI to use a native FS to eliminate any potential issues with that.


It's mounted on /disk and linked from ~pi/.bitcoin, but everything is owned by pi. But I'll try that too.

You seem to believe that bitcoin can become the measuring stick on its own unstoppable strength, even if exchanging it for fiat money becomes illegal.

Yeah, I don't trust online wallets (obviously!), hardware wallets or 3rd party software wallets. I want to have full control. :)

"Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given socio-economic context or country."
Are going to argue that since not everything can be bought with bitcoin then it isn't money? Is there an agreed-upon threshold that turns not-money into money?

Um... there's no blue pesos. was referring to the black market exchange rate known as "blue dollar". If you have pesos and you want to buy dollars, either you ask the government for permission (and you have to show your plane tickets) and get anything from 0 to 100 dollars for each day of your trip, or you purchase them in the black market at blue dollar price, which is about 1.8 times as expensive.
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:41:29
Yes, I think bitcoin has value as long as it can be exchanged for a mainstream currency or enough goods that you don't need mainstream currencies anymore, at which point it will have become one.
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:21:35
Eventually you will come to the conclusion that in life not everything is 100% one way or another. 
Central banks and governments do have a role even if they are not efficient. Alternatives like NGOs and Bitcoin exist because governments aren't as efficient as they ought to be. That doesn't mean all government is 100% bad and should be eliminated.
@_date: 2013-07-10 13:37:43
That is correct. BTC is not 30% more valuable in Argentina. It only appears to be because people are trading at the unofficial USD exchange rate, while in other countries the official USD exchange rate is used. 
It's not BTC scarcity or demand. It's USD scarcity and demand.
@_date: 2013-07-18 13:14:50
Huh, that is a strange market right there. You can even buy BTC cheaper than the selling price. I could make a profit just by buying and selling and buying again... 
@_date: 2013-06-23 18:05:34
This data you talk about is actually money. That's the key difference.
@_date: 2013-07-08 03:59:02
I wouldn't say they are "being nice". They need money and they know many people hold undeclared funds. They are willing to forgive them if they are willing to get their money into the system. The fact that this is not a very attractive investment is what makes it not so nice.

According to this C&amp;D order, it is. Let's see who's opinion wins.
@_date: 2013-06-27 00:31:17
Who would sell you an expensive item for bitcoin unless they can easily purchase other items with those bitcoins or convert them into fiat money? Unless bitcoin is mainstream enough that the inability to turn it into fiat money is irrelevant, that inability will crash its value.
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:43:52
Interestingly, in the same issue Mt.Gox published a full-page ad linking to [this special landing page] (
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:16:25
You're right, I had lost track of the conversation. If we assume that exchanges are legal for long enough that bitcoin becomes mainstream, at that point you can convert it into fiat money by the mechanism you proposed, although it'd be a pretty cumbersome process. 
And assuming the government wanted to crack down on such activities, you'd be out of luck too. You would eventually be asked to show how you got that money. Snce your income comes from outside of the legal system, you would have nothing to back it up, hence tax evation.
@_date: 2013-06-23 23:23:44
Ok, let me say it anoter way. Owning copyrighted material without paying the associated license fees is illegal. The activity of trasfering files is not illegal. 
On the other hand, assuming that bitcoin is a currency, the only purpose of the bitcoin client is to *provide the infrastructure to* hold, receive and send money, and this, without a license, might be illegal.

Excerpt from the article:
"**The opportunity to act now**
As highlighted by the latest initiative of the 
United States to arrest some of the suspects 
that were involved in Liberty Reserve (a 
group indicted for money laundering that ran 
a $6 billion worldwide operation out of Costa 
Rica), alternative payment mechanisms, such 
as Bitcoin and a host of others, can enable 
criminal and terrorist groups to launder 
money and fund their operations.
Governments of the world have the ability 
right now to ban these payment mechanisms. 
At the heart of this initiative is a simple premise: at one end of the transaction, 
a user must ‘buy’ the ‘internet currency’, 
and at the other end the criminals must 
turn the currency into real money. 
If treasuries and ﬁnancial institutions 
around the world were to block those 
transactions and permit only legitimate 
currencies to be used on the internet through regulated payment service providers and 
cards (such as Visa, MasterCard and American 
Express), then the ﬂow of many billions of 
dollars to criminal groups would be stemmed.
Furthermore, if those same countries 
introduced, if necessary, additional legislation 
to conﬁscate the proceeds of such online 
crime, these funds could be either returned to those who had been defrauded or 
used to fund international projects that 
could bring about a more safe and secure 
internet environment for all citizens.
If the leaders of the European Union and 
United States could be convinced to take a 
lead on these initiatives, that would be a huge 
contribution to making the internet a safe 
place for ﬁnancial transactions. At the same 
time, it would also strike a blow against those 
who would try to destroy the fabric of our the 
world’s well-being.
The International Cyber Security 
Protection Alliance stands ready to work 
with governments interested in taking these 
hugely cost-effective and sensible measures."
@_date: 2013-07-08 04:02:14
That's exactly right. The only incentive is being able to invest that money in real estate without having to pay fines for not having declared the money.
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:30:26
Argentinian dollars? Don't you mean pesos?
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:34:30
It doesn't matter how mathematically neat bitcoin is. It needs a connection with reality. It can't work in vacuum. To get to the point at which it is widely accepted in exchange of goods and services, it needs to be exchangeable for fiat money. Otherwise it has no value. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 01:20:20
Ok, that thread showed that efficiency does not necessarily come from the private sector. People are people regardless of where they work.
Anyway, I understand your point about efficiency of resource allocation, and I agree that central planning is worse than free market. But those are just the two extremes and we all agree which extreme is preferable.
That doesn't mean that there is no role for government. It should not be as large as it usually is, but it should not be zero. Some necessary things will simply never get done by the free market forces alone. If you think that because they are necessary they will eventually get done, you are deluding yourself.
@_date: 2013-07-10 18:53:26
I have never had that experience, and I go through EZE customs 6 to 8 times a year. It probably depends on how many passengers are waiting in line and where the flights come from. Flights coming from Miami for example are probably being scrutinized more than, say, Atlanta, because Miami is kind of Argentina's shopping mall for the somewhat wealthy. I usually don't go to Miami, though, so that may be the reason I don't see what you describe.
BTW, a friend of mine had the "let's see your cash" experience at the hand baggage check before entering the airplane in Houston. Two police officers approached him and asked how much money he was carrying. "Are you sure?" and "last chance before we count the money". Police state? Nah.

Wire transfers can be made online, painlessly, but they do take a few days.

Well, I don't agree. Even while living under a VERY corrupt government, I see things that the government does, that would not get done otherwise. People would die because of this, just because it would not be profitable to help them. Fuck that.

What about taxes? Ultimately if governments don't accept tax payment in bitcoin, everybody will need to be able to convert bitcoin to fiat money, and governments can make that as easy or as hard as they want.

Agreed, the use of the program is not illegal without a license, but the program is arguably the infrastructure by which the transfers happen, and providing that infrastructure without a license might be illegal.

@_date: 2013-07-07 20:19:17
I am pretty much against the K government, but the amount of stupid I see in this post, the linked article and most comments here is staggering.
We are forbidden to buy dollars, that is true. But to say that people are being forced to buy bonds is beyond stupid. Nobody is being forced.
The one thing that I don't see mentioned is the fact that the Cedin carries a pardon for not having previously declared that money, which opens the door for all kinds of shady people to get away with their shady activities' gains, most of which are probably in the government.
Another thing not mentioned is that the Cedins are only for buying property, to reactivate the construction and real estate segments. The construction segment has a big multiplying effect on the rest of the economy, so it may not be that bad of an idea. Except in that it may cause a construction bubble, a bit like the chinese ghost cities.

What I was saying is that if the regulators say that bitcoin is currency, then they can argue that the bitcoin foundation is providing the means to operate an unlicensed tranfer of money. This cease and desist order seems to indicate that this is the case.
@_date: 2013-06-24 12:57:30
You seem unfamiliar with the meaning of "implementation" in software. I'd usually explain, but in your case...
@_date: 2013-07-10 13:56:52
Yes, indeed. Why invent this ridiculous idea that the government is ordering the people to surrender their dollars. 
Or is it just laziness?
BTW, I'm not saying that they're not robbing me blind. They are pretty much doing that through inflation. Which is why nobody wants to save in ARS and this is the reason for the USD black market and its 1.8 times higher price, which in turn is the real reason people think BTC has a higher value in Argentina (it doesn't).

So you predict that they are going to open bank safes and ask foreign governments to provide banking information about their argentinean customers? 
Do you have some actual insight into this, or are you just comfortably sitting in your armchair in the US speculating about the future actions of a government 6000 miles away?
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:21:42
Bullshit. Nobody is being forced to buy anything.
@_date: 2013-06-26 20:17:55
Yes, but this only works if the establishment allows it. Ultimately you have to pay your taxes with something.
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:29:57
Except this is not a control attempt. They are trying to lure evaders to bring their money into the system. Evaders can (and likely will) ignore the song of the siren. There is nothing to "find a way around".

Where do you sell your bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-07-11 00:09:41
I don't care if you are american or from the UK. I asked about your location and chose the US as the most probable because of reddit's user base. Sorry I didn't do enough research about your location...
I remember riding an elevator in a bank in 2001 and hearing people comment that savings accounts were in peril, before the "deposit intangibility law" made everybody understand what was coming. You do get more exposure if you live here than if you hear about it remotely. So yes, the location of your armchair matters a lot.
In any case, what historical governments are you referring to?

Once used for construction they are convertible into real dollars. But at that point they are already in the system and they have to pay taxes on them.
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:03:42
I agree, but as long as you pay taxes in fiat money, you need to be able to convert.
@_date: 2013-06-23 21:01:07
Right, and wire transfers don't actually send physical money either, it's just an agreement between parts about a protocol the follow. Come on.

I don't know how pervasive it is, but when it happens, it probably does harm the kids involved.
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:35:58
No, you would get the same 100 dollars back. If you sell in pesos you would get roughly the value of a black market dollar. This is equivalent to just bringing dollars and selling them in the black market. The only advantage is that you don't need to worry about carrying the dollars in your way in.
