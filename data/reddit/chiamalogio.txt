For what? ��

 Currently, Tether, which is supposed to be a coin pegged to the dollar, is trading for just 94 cents. Bitfinex, whose CEOs are intertwined with Tether's operations, has decoupled from the other markets. Given that there are billions of Tethers outstanding, many believe that Tether's collapse would be catastrophic to the cryptocurrency industry. They're right, because that would be exactly the sort of panic that is needed to take bitcoins down to the further capitulation that I've been talking about.
I think that it's important, however, to differentiate what is likely to happen to exchanges in a similar situation to Bitfinex and Tether, and what happened to exchanges like Mt. Gox and Cryptsy. In the latter two cases, money was actually stolen from the exchanges, and those exchanges illegally continued to operate while they were insolvent. In the current situation, the exchanges that will fail are likely to be able to fully account for all assets.  
However, as I've been repeatedly mentioning, there is a paradoxical effect taking place right now where banks are becoming much more strict in closing accounts of completely legal cryptocurrency businesses, despite a smaller percentage of cryptocurrency than ever before being used for illegal activities. It no longer matters whether a company actually has dollars. It only matters whether those dollars can be accessed by the company.  
Every time banks have decided to close our accounts, the procedure is always the same. They say that deposits to the accounts will be rejected beginning immediately, but the account can continue to be used to send money out for a month or so. If Bitfinex has had its banks close its accounts, then **what is happening right now is exactly what we should expect to see**. The banks, without warning, would have notified Bitfinex that they were closing their accounts and were prohibiting deposits immediately. That would force them to set the site to stop accepting wire transfers. Withdrawals, on the other hand, would not yet be suspended, so the exchange can continue sending money to customers who want to receive money. Slowdowns in withdrawals, though reported as suspicious, could simply be due to the high volume of wires requested by panicked customers.  
This bank account closure process we've experienced sets a deadline until access to the account is blocked and the money must be removed. Since humans like round numbers, in our case the deadlines given have usually been one month from now or at the end of the next month.  
Given this experience, if I had to guess what is most likely to happen in a hypothetical situation where an exchange has lost banking services, it is that the exchange will end up sitting on a cashier's check for billions of dollars. The deadline will pass, they will not be able to obtain a new bank account, and the bank will mail them a check. Coins associated with the exchange would crash when dollar withdrawals are halted, bringing the cryptocurrency markets down with it, starting the next downward phase of this bubble cycle. Eventually, the exchange will either obtain a bank account or will declare bankruptcy, because it can't spend any of its money to continue operations. If bankruptcy occurs, then customers might end up losing money solely because the lawyers involved in the process would take fees from the previously fully backed assets. The bankruptcy attorney will probably have an easier time of getting a bank to cash the check to pay former customers.  
I'm confident that the banking environment has now become so difficult that we will likely see at least one major exchange go out of business solely because it cannot obtain a bank account. The inability to obtain a bank account will not be indicative of any wrongdoing by the company, so it isn't possible to predict which exchange it will be by looking at how trustworthy it seems to be. And the truth is that I wouldn't be able to say that the panic and price crashes that will ensue from this exchange failure will be unwarranted - the inability to obtain bank accounts is significantly holding back the industry right now. This is a ticking time bomb - one that would cause me to hedge my bets in a more stable currency if I had a bank account.  
What's ironic about all of it is that if that happens, the industry will have regressed since the bottom of the last bubble. Last time, customers lost because the bad guys took their money. Customers will have lost this time because the good guys tied up honest people's money in the banking and legal system, despite the CEOs having done nothing wrong.

No one can tell if it will survive, but I think this is going to happen.

Craig thinks he can do it (and tricked Calvin into funding his operation). Here he is talking to Dave's brother about cracking the files (lying about who they are originally from, of course).

This is the place to be. The very fact that the beginning of bitcoin began in the criminal world of the darknet (Silk Road). Means a lot.  
Even on this fact, Satoshi was not a good decent citizen.   
Whose first users invention - bitcoin, traded in drugs and weapons.

 This theory is actually incredibly good as it explains a lot. As the creator of TrueCrypt he would certainly have the technical knowledge to create Bitcoin and as you said, Satoshi stopped posting roughly 1 year before LeRoux was arrested by DEA agents. From what I read about him, he was also obsessed with ways of laundering money from his illegal activities.

 There are some interesting circumstantial connections to Satoshi:  
Considered to be a "brilliant" programmer with a strong C++ background - Most people would call you crazy if you attempted to put a 6 billion dollar prize behind an internet facing application without memory safety  
Author of crypto/privacy software - E4M and possibly TrueCrypt written in C++  
Experience hiding identity both online and off  
Millionaire - Satoshi never converted any of his btc fortune  
Anti-authoritarian  
Understands the benefits of digital currency - Has millions of dollars stacked in boxes  
Understands the payment problem - Illegal prescription drug marketplaces  
Has an interest in internet gambling software - The first version of btc actually had some code for a marketplace and poker:   
Multifocal - Satoshi vanished around April 23 2011 to "move on to other things"  
South African spelling/phrasing - analyse, colour, defence, bloody hard

Craig Wright was an employee of Le Roux, who was vaguely aware of the bitcoin project. Craig was an informant who helped bring down Le Roux, and after his arrest, Craig managed (via long time friend and partner in crime, Dave Kleiman) to get his hands on the wallets that hold a million bitcoins, but unfortunately for Craig, all of Solotshi's coins are locked away in secure TrueCrypt volumes (TrueCrypt being another software that Le Roux developed). He has been trying for years to crack them but with no success.  
Another of Craig's long time friends, Calvin Ayre, has set up warehouses of computers to try to crack Solotshi's password and unlock the vast fortunes; his mining activity is simply a front to make these massive datacenters look legitimate. Craig is being set up as 'the real satoshi' so that when the coins are finally unlocked, they can legitimately sell them off.
