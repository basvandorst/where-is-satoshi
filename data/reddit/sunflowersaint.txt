Its already difficult for the average person to run a full node, and the whole point of Bitcoin is that you can be your own bank.
$5 per month might not sound like much, but what's it going to be at the next block size increase, and the next one, and the next one?
The issue is that no has plan for BCH beyond the next 6 months.

It was always the case that the BCH hard fork was going to impact on sentiment re. Bitcoin. The same pot of money is now invested in 2 coins rather than one. Whatever dubious "features" BCH was going to add were always going to be overshadowed by the impact of negative sentiment. This was explained to Ver on numerous occasions, but there is no one as blind as a man who cannot see.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:13:40
BCH and numerous other altcoins are out there to be used if people want low fees and fast tx times, but it hasn't happening, so it would appear that people aren't interested. People want to use Bitcoin because they trust it. They're willing to wait rather than jumping into the unknown with altcoins.

Its not a GOP v Dems thing. All Governments inflate fiat to buy voters. That's the point.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:17:24
Tax cuts would have nothing to do with monetary supply or inflation if the State curtailed spending to match the reduced revenue. Except that doesn't happen. The State just issues more securitised debt, which becomes part of M2/M3 money supply, which has an inflationary effect. If the debt were at some stage retired, M2/M3 would be reduced, and there should be a resulting deflationary effect. But that doesn't happen either. Instead, the old debt is just rolled over into new debt, and supply just keeps ballooning and ballooning.

This is my understanding of current debate too.
However, the prospect of BTC being replaced by another coin is over egged. BTC has sufficient girth to allow careful implementation of LN. If LN doesn't work then all bets are off, but personnally I wouldn't rely on a coin that has to scale vertically on chain using hard forks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:15:41
Opposition to larger blocks is not the same as opposition to BCH.
*Everybody* understands that the block size as to grow. The BTC view is that it should only grow as a last resort. 
"It would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.."
Anyway, I don't think it's helpful to base the scaling debate on interpretations of 8 year 2 line Satoshi posts on a forum, or on the white paper for that matter.

The concern here isn't the price. Fuck the price.
The concern is around forking.
The idea of competing versions of Bitcoin was always the greatest threat to the project. Consensus and growth without hard forks has always been the golden rule.
BCH is the strongest hard fork so far. The "low fees" narrative is very compelling to people who don't understand the necessity of Bitcoin remaining decentralised while it scales.
This is the first time a competing version of Bitcoin has had traction. If there are 2 versions of Bitcoin, with comparable hash rate and adoption, both could fail. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:06:29
If BTC price falls, fees fall, and the bottleneck shifts. There is a presumption here that come other coin can handle the load BTC is currently handling.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:10:25
Its bad because BCH's scaling road map is entirely based on bigger and bigger blocks, which is unsustainable. Within 6 months you'd have people arguing for and against hard forks for 256MB blocks, 512MB blocks etc etc.

In my jurisdiction (Ireland) a gain is released if you dispose of the asset as payment for something else. Probably the same elsewhere. Would be too easy to get around capital gains tax otherwise.
Euro analogy is false. You didn't buy the euros. If you bought another currency in fx transaction, and they appreciated in value against taxable currency, that is a taxable gain.
Remember, Bitcoin is not designed to avoid tax.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:18:01
You can't have a Hard Fork with consensus. Be definition, a hard fork is where some nodes change the consensus rules such that they are incompatible with other nodes. The nodes that have not updated cannot use the same chain as the nodes that have upgraded. BCH was a hard fork.
A soft fork is where some nodes change the consensus rules but the new rules are compatible with the old ones. The nodes that do not upgrade can continue to use the same chain as the nodes that have upgraded. SegWit was a soft fork.
Soft forks are fine. Hard forks should always be avoided.

The purpose in all of this is to replace currency controlled by a central authority. Let's try to remember that.
At the moment, the only thing the average Joe Donuts understands is the US dollars in his wallet. The objective here is to get him to trust a new type of currency, that he can rely on to replace his greenbacks.
How the fuck are you going to do that if his cryptographic currency changes every 3 months, requiring him to obtain a new wallet and software to use it, or where he turns up at his grocery store to find out that they no longer accept the crypto that they accepted last week?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:10:31
Explanation (open to correction):
Somebody (institutions) created a massive sell order at inflated price to try and suppress trading price so that they can take cheaper positions on futures. They did not anticipate actual sale would take place.
However, they underestimated demand. Bitcoin price reached order price, the sale of all their coins was executed and the market devoured them in seconds.
ie they got fucked.
Note: I'm in full tin-foil-hat mode here. May have nothing to do with institutions. As another poster pointed out, may well just be an exchange liquidating BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-20 08:53:56
Fees are a feature in that they prevent spamming the network. The 1mb block is also a feature, but it is inhibiting growth at the moment, in that the original design never anticipated that the 1mb block would not be able to scale during a period of rapid adoption.
The question the arises here is the trajectory Bitcoin wants to take, not where it is today. Today, its choked, but to me the BCH response to that isn't viable. If the blocksize has proven to be an inhibitor to growth, why would you use the blocksize as the basis of your scaling strategy?
To me, it makes more sense to move the Txs off-chain and reserve the capacity of the chain for settlement. That solves the fee issue without removing the fee feature.
The problem is that people just aren't patient enough to allow this happen.

The problem with institutional money is that its highly fluid. Pension managers don't HODL. They have rules that require them to divest when circumstances converge.

Your asking the wrong question.
You should be asking why is there is such a rush to scale.
Nobody is going to die or starve if Bitcoin can't scale today or tomorrow.
Bitcoin will be around for thousands of years. If adopted universally, no block size will ever be large enough to accommodate use, so scaling via block size increases is pointless.
Instead, off chain solutions need to be developed, which means we can scale the block size sustainably.
But again, there is no deadline here. Its better to take 20 years to get it right that get rekt tomorrow just so someone doesn't have to use fiat to buy a coffee.

Mining requires hardware and electricity. The cost of those commodities will be greater than the value of any Bitcoin you obtain from mining. At this stage in its evolution, Bitcoin mining is only profitable if you have free electricity and can make your own hardware. Of course, you could get lucky and hit a streak, in which case you could make *some* money, but equally it could go the other way.
You have to understand that as the price goes up, the more people mine, and as more people mine, the difficulty goes up, making it less likely your mining will be successful.

Yes, all coinage was once gold, and currency issuance was backed by gold. Gold has value in industry and jewellery, but that accounts for only a small part of its value. Most of of its value is based on future trust, which is build upon its original value as a means of exchange.

I'm the OP. I first mentioned BTC to them in 2015. I've never told them how much BTC I have. Nor have I ever mentioned anything about my salary, mortgage.

I agree with your logic. The blocksize is an issue, but increasing the block size is not the answer, if that makes sense. No block size will every be big enough for a universally adopted crypto-currency. There is no deadline here. We've had fiat for 1,000 years. We can take a few more years to get this right.

It has the same value *if* it has utility.

OK, fair enough, but its important to point out that Bitcoin will have have long term value if it has utility, and that it can't just survive as an asset like an oil painting or a bottle of wine.
Also, Layer 2 is still essentially vapourware, and its by no means certain that Bitcoin's credibility will survive to the point whereby Layer 2 is a day to day reality.

Conflating Bitcoin and things like gold or Apple stock is totally misguided.
Nobody buys gold or Apple stock with the intention of holding them forever. They buy them with the intention of converting them back to fiat so that they can realise material gain.
Buying Bitcoin to convert back to fiat is the antithesis of what Bitcoin is about, and if that it what is driving the price, Bitcoin will fail.
Therefore, Bitcoin has to have some other ultimate purpose. It has to be exchangeable for good and services across the economy. It has to become a currency.
So yes, merchants do have to accept Bitcoin for it to be very, very successful.

Somebody once explained to that both of these things are mutually dependent. For Bitcoin to become mainstream, people need to know about it, so there needs to be a speculative bubble that excites the interest of people who have no interest in the technology or the politics.
Similarly, to maintain value for those people whose only interest is speculation, the technology needs to work and grow.
Of course, the bubble has to burst, and a lot of the speculative interest will flee, but at that stage, its mission accomplished. We have mass awareness of Bitcoin, which is a fundamental step towards mass adoption.

The standard at this point seems to be to treat all forked coins as altcoins, regardless of their merits, and to only change the BTC association when 1 chain clearly and categorically becomes longer than the current BTC chain.
If all the exchanges stick to this rule, we'll probably be OK. Ultimately, its the users, not the exchanges, who should decide which coin rules them all.

Yes, someone else might have a bum node, but at least that's transparent. There is no transparency in a VPS. If the entire network had to rely on VPSs (because of bandwidth costs of larger blocks) overall trust in the network is impaired.

True, but the bandwidth consumption is a killer. Really only an option if you have no-cap broadband, and fast upload (rather than download). A node can consume 200GB per month.
This is one of the main arguments against larger blocks. Running a node with 1mb blocks is hard enough.

Start a full node
Run the BIP148 PPA
**NB** You need to transact on it (use it as a wallet) for it to make a difference. It about an *economic* majority, not just a majority of nodes. However, signalling that you support does put more pressure on miners to get into line, but they can just chose to ignore that too. If you're actually transacting, they can't ignore that.

Ethereum has shown some inverse correlation to BTC recently. There is obvious interest in Crypto, so if BTC fall is triggered by something specific to BTC (eg scalability shenanigans) then ETC may gain. If there is a general move away from crypto, you're going to lose either way.

There aren't very many wallets listing support here:
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:57:29
I didn't say it did.
An economic majority isn't a technical phenomenon. It means that if a majority of nodes *that are trading* are supporting BIP148, there is an imperative for minority to do so also, otherwise, they're going to be transacting on a dying chain.
The actual number of nodes supporting BIP148 is irrelevant. If they are not transacting, they are not "economic", and therefore have no bearing on whether on economic majority is created or not.
This is why the emphasis is on getting Exchanges and Wallet nodes to support BIP148, as they are constantly transacting.

I wasn't planning on pushing my life savings through a t2.micro in EC2. My only interest in this is political. My understanding of the BIP148 initiative is that the more nodes that are signalling support of the UASF, the more incentive there is for miners to enforce BIP148.
I have €200 worth of free compute power in a drawer in my desk and just wanted to know if there was a way I could use it to add weight to the initiative.
From what I've read, a lot of the nodes signalling support are running on VPSs.
