I can personally attest to waiting more than a month and a half to get my account "reverified" (there was no explanation as to why I needed to do this) with mtgox and am waiting almost a week for the bitcoin transfer of some of my funds to make it out of that exchange.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:10:21
Had 50+ BTC at Gox when Bitcoins were hovering around $200.  Went to Africa for a month in November and the price skyrocketed.  As soon as I got back I attempted to get my BTC out only to find that my account was mysteriously unverified after being verified for about a year and a half.  Was fighting with their abominable support for all of Dec and Jan only to have this most recent problem hit in Feb.  
I hate mtgox and will never use them again but will cry tears of unfathomable sadness if they go under.  I thought I had a house down payment :-(

I think so but you should always keep a majority of your coins in a cold or hardware wallet.
@_date: 2011-04-30 18:05:06
Exactly, the price for things if bitcoin ever takes off would necessarily have to plummet to sub-coin range.  Wouldn't it be weird that, unlike the japanese yen where a happy meal costs ~￥500 a happy meal could cost .00005 bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-06-10 01:13:07
I would monitor the IRC channel that bitcoin connect to in order to find peers.  There is an average of 4,000 - 5,000 connections at any given time so maybe the total number of users is 5x - 10x that?
@_date: 2015-11-21 19:11:32
coinkite too comes to mine
@_date: 2011-05-19 15:28:12
Well, it used to be easier but paypal shut down the 2 main guys who were selling bitcoins saying that currency exchanges were violating their terms of service.  Now you have to find individual guys who will do one off trades here and there.
The current "best" method, one I haven't tried yet, is to use a dwolla.com account to buy mtgox.com credits.  That takes around 5-7 days though the first time cause dwolla has to verify your bank account details etc.  
The price right now is $7.  If you send that much to alt229 (at) crapnstuff.com I'll send ya a bitcoin.  Include your bitcoin address somewhere so I know where to send it :-)

They are all related. Generally speaking when BTC goes down they all do. With the current exception of Ethereum though I think it's still fairly linked
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:21:22
Eth is the only exception but when bitcoin corrects I'll eat my hat if it doesn't correct also.
@_date: 2013-07-05 17:17:52

I found the issue and have corrected it.  I accidentally used one of my "I just want to type this shit in quickly" passwords on my webhost that the guy used to sneak into an email forwarding account.  Pretty crafty but it's weird to think that someone was targeting me directly.  
Come to think of it, I may disassociate all my bitcoin accounts from my address that was on the mtgox leak a few years ago.  I swear there are assholes targeting only those users and I noticed it like 2 days after the leak.  The custom spam is amusing though.
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:39:18
I've heard of last pass and am curious about it's enterprise features such as shared databases.  I think 1Pass4 supports that now too though I haven't set it up.

Yep, 520 shares.  Funny cause I'm totally addicted to bitcoins and read about them every day but have never signed a transaction.  I can do this though.  I guess I could send a bitcoin to myself, sign that transaction, then send you the details so you can verify?  Is this normally what people do?

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL BTC TRADING CORP WEBSITE PARTICIPANTS
As a result of recent changes in the virtual currency regulatory environment, the btct.co and litecoinglobal.com virtual stock market websites will be closing down.  The following is our current schedule:
Approximately a week ago, both sites were closed to any new users and new asset creation was disabled.
 
Effective immediately, in conjunction with this release, trading will be halted, all order books cleared, and trading re-enabled.
 
October 7, 2013, all forms of secondary market trading will be halted on both sites.
 
Approximately October 31, 2013, both sites will be taken offline.  It is strongly suggested that participants take the following steps to protect all of their virtual assets:
 
All participants should take steps to transfer all of your BTC and LTC (and any other data you wish to keep, such as CSV trade histories) held on the sites to your personal computer or another trusted site.
 
All participants should make sure that their public BTC or LTC address is properly set in the Account page on the Settings tab whereby it can be shared with all issuers.
 
All “issuers” should have the contact information concerning their “investors”, and we ask that all “issuers” communicate with their “investors” as soon as possible as to how they will ensure that all are treated appropriately.
We regret this development. However, we want to do everything we can to minimize problems arising from this transition.  It is our goal to keep this shutdown orderly and calm.
Thank you for your participation, creativity, loyalty and sense of community over the past year.  Additional communications will follow as we work out the details.

Update from Mar 29
"Thank you for your patience.
We apologize for taking so long in informing you and answering your emails.
For a few days, we have been solely dedicated to clarifying all doubts and answer all questions related to the events that affected the two sites I run. However, as we had to inform a lot of people at once, then choose and implement the best possible contingency plan, we ended up taking more than we expected.
Unfortunately, the redeem code implementation of the Mercado Bitcoin, an exchange I run in Brazil was successfully hacked. Because of a programming mistake, the attacker could generate new credit codes without having his balance debited accordingly. So he could lead the system into creating a fraudulent amount of bitcoins and have enough time to redeem it in the early hours of the day.
The diverted amount was enough to compromise the operation of both Mercado Bitcoin and Bitcoin Rain.
I confess I am still considering the best way to reimburse the investors of the Bitcoin Rain site.
Those who have been our clients for the last months can testify to our capacity to repay and work hard.
Many users have already offered to be put on the end of the line, giving up their dividends and receive only the amount originally invested. Others even offered to donate, so the services keep going.
I am studying some options to try to solve the problem the best way possible, which include: freezing the current balances in dollars, freezing/limiting withdrawals for a few weeks, etc.
I will take a day or two to figure out all that planning.
I would like to receive suggestions from you in the following email: admin
I thank you for the trust you deposited on me up to this point.
I only ask you for a little more patience while I choose the best plan to solve this dire situation.
I certainly will do my best to keep deserving the trust you have been depositing on me and my investment service for more than one year.

@_date: 2013-08-16 13:29:29
There are 2 types of hack that any physical BTC would be subject to.  
1)  Overcoming the "tamper proof" verification be it a sticker or scratcher etc.  Having a kid put it in a safe place will prevent this type of attack.
2).  If the creator of the physical bitcoins made some mistake or had an information leak when creating the coins.  Let's say they accidentally let an employee see the private keys or used a bad random number generator such as the recent android issue then the coins could just disappear.
The second type of attack is the only thing you really need to worry about it and comes down to trusting the vendor you got your items from.
In short though, and with sub &lt;$1000 amounts, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
@_date: 2013-09-03 18:35:27
There are a lot of scammers on BTCJam so I would recommend staying away.  Coinlenders CDs have been good for me so far but probably the most reliable ones to get are the various bonds on bitfunder and btct.

Just ordered one of each!  Hope they look as great IRL as they do on the site!

There are a lot of brainwashed people in this country...

I'm sorry to hear this.  I hung out with Yifu at the San Jose conference and liked the guy.

Wonder what this means for the bets on betsofbitco.in and bitbet.us...

I hear ya.  I don't think mining at home is ever going to be profitable from now on unless bitcoins bounce to $1000 or more which I certainly hope they do but it's anyone's guess...
I met them at the Bitcoin San Jose conference and my impression is that they are a PR challenged company but with good intentions who jumped into the VERY deep end with the whole ASIC thing and then proceeded to under deliver consistently ever since.  I feel for them though since I could see myself in their shoes, struggling to keep things going when so many things outside my control was going south.
I do hope they ship all their gear and can turn around their PR disasters.

Looks good but for the love of Christ why would you bet on BFL?  So far they've been DFL in just about every measurable way.
Get in on ASICMINER or Avalon or KnC instead!
