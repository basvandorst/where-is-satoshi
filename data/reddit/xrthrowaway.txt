1. You don't have to install anything. 
2. It looks like it was cloned directly from bitcoinica's private github repo.

Very poorly written game, reminiscent of the old 90s style web games. Good luck, I guess.

I upgraded bitcoind to 0.4.3 and after the block chain finished downloading it seemed to work just fine. I still don't trust the reliability of the daemon so I've written a script to make sure bitcoind is still responding and to restart it if it isn't.

I had no idea what the latest version was and just happened to assume 0.4.0 - the one on my machine - was it.

This attack is in no way able to retrieve or reverse engineer the private keys on those RSA tokens.

Oh, I thought you were accepting too, my bad. I found a document outlining the protocol for the Moneypak API but since it wasn't meant for public use, it doesn't list any of the api endpoints :((

Why repost it when you haven't taken anyone's suggestions the last time you posted it? Still no valid ssl cert, looks incredibly shady, etc.

Email headers are like metadata used to convey more information beyond the actual email. They usually contain things like the From/To addresses, email encoding settings, etc.
Finding the headers is really specific to your client, but if you use gmail, you can click the down arrow next to the send time and click "show original." Pretty much everything above the actual email body will be part of the headers.

You kinda need traffic first if you want to make money off a website.
Assuming you take care of that traffic thing, you could probably just set up a donation address for the site, and let people know they can send you bitcoins if they enjoy the service.

Someone calculated his forced liquidation values and caused him to lose all his money. To do so requires a lot of money, and he goes on blaming Zhoutong, the owner of Bitcoinica.

Yeah, that's expected. I always set minconf to at least 6, though.

I can't be bothered to read through the entire thing, but I'm pretty sure buying digital *currencies* is against the Paypal ToS.

You need around 30 BTC to even become a seller there.

I believe it will have the same effect on just about anything. I think r/askscience might be a better place for that type of thing though.

Instead of sleeping every second for one second, you should pause more "intelligently" and monitor the temperature; if you reach a certain threshold for a certain amount of time, then pause.

There is no difference in bitcoind for 0.4.3 and 0.5.2.

Sorry for leaving that out. The constant expansion and contraction is definitely not a good thing. Heating and cooling over and over will eventually cause cracking.

Yeah, I noticed it too. It worried me at first cause I thought I may have been on a phishing clone of the site where they accidentally left that out. Realized later I wasn't the only one and felt so much better, lol.

Just a head's up, no one will sell you bitcoins via paypal unless you are really trusted. Paypal makes fraud way too easy, not to mention buying digital currencies is against their terms of service.

The Swiss Pharmacy does not sell controlled substances. Although a lot of the stuff there typically requires a prescription, it's not against the law to buy them online.

Is it automatic? I attempted a service like this but was disappointed when I found out moneypak only offered its API to large companies. :/

Yup, you are right, I hadn't completely downloaded the block chain. The problem however was with the client itself also - new block chains weren't being downloaded or were being downloaded incredibly slowly. I had been running bitcoind 0.4.0, apparently notorious for its bad network performance and overall sluggishness. I upgraded to 0.4.3 and the block chain had resumed downloading. Once the block chain completed the daemon/jsonrpc interface was snappy again.
I give my thanks to you and
