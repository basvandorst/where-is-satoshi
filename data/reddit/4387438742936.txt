Man if I were a reporter i would hype the shit out of these and then bail on them the moment it is published. Its like free money!

In what way would the stories in the media change if we knew for certain that reporters were doing a classic pump and dump on coins? I am getting spam right now about penny stocks what will say the exact same things as these articles, but its about some worthless stock they are hoping will bounce slightly and they can dump off of.

I want you to pay me back in internet fun bux that will involve 7-8 steps including a money order to the magic the gathering online exchange.

The fact that the currency requires shit like this makes it seem creepy and flawed. "OK grandma we need to store these digits inside a vault under the ocean in case someone tries to steal our e-money, we can type them back into the computer when the illuminati have been defeated and it is safe for FREE PERSONS to prosper once again." If someone steals my CC number I can make a phone call and that shit is **handled**.

Inherently deflationary currencies encourage hording since not spending your money is itself an investment. this is awful for any economy and represents only one of many flaws of the buttcoins. I am ready for someone to link me some completely insane freeman of the land ravings about how this is wrong.

Just imagine if you had spent that money on coins in november when they were $10! Instead you get to wait for hardware that may not exist,  will compete with real hardware that has knocked the difficulty into the atmosphere, and might not even show you a single coin until after the fad collapses! (get a refund before they go insolvent)
