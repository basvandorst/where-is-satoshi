Thank you very much. Yes, I need for the entire website actually, not only contact form. For example, when a user comment on a post, an e-mail notification is sent to the owner of the page, when someone subscribe another page, etc. I'll check this solution, thanks, they seem to be good too.

Yes, indeed :)

We plan to add multilanguage in the next days too, and the website will detect the user country to redirect to the right language. Thanks for the comment!

Well, this is our main objective (to be a solution for recurring payments with Bitcoins). The solutions I know for this are Coinmama, Coinbase (they allow credit card and monthly purchases).
With [Clica.net]( the users will subscribe pages using Bitcoins and they will pay the subscriptions every month. In case they run out of funds, the system will send e-mail notifications, etc.

I understand your point of view about middleman and bitcoin. We started the platform with bitcoins first, because we want to keep up and running independent. But in the future we may accept other payment methods to facilitate these transactions (we plan to add our own credit card processor too, and depending on the country of the user, another payment method more easy for him), think that Bitcoin as one of the payment methods right now (and main currency).
I don't wanna launch the website accepting only credit cards first (or PayPal) to be up and running for 2 months and then when PayPal or Master Card press a single button because they don't like something on clica.net, we and our users are all gone (this happened this week with a platform).

The idea is the donor support not only 1 creator, but he will be able to support more than 1 creator and buy products too. So, the donor deposit money on his wallet and he performs internal transactions when he clicks to subscribe to a page or to buy a product. These internal transactions will deduct from his balance (or increase, in case this user has a page there too and sell subscriptions or products). So, for example, if I sell a $5 membership there and someone subscribe me, my balance in the same moment will appear $5 and I'll be able to buy things there (this I call internal transaction).
I'll take a look on what you said, seems to be interesting. Thanks

And our objective is to offer an easy interface for people who have no idea about what is a Bitcoin, how to buy and how to use Bitcoins too.

Honest reviews are always welcome, thanks.
Well, right now we offer a free place to users where they can create a custom page to publish posts, images, etc. They can create membership tiers and publish posts for members on that tier only (example, a post for members who are paying $5 / month only). We offer an organized list where the creator can see more details about their members (so they can deliver custom rewards), another place where the members can contact creators or creators can contact their members and e-mail notifications too.
We hope to offer the "explore creators" page to everyone soon (we will do this when reaching some users there, maybe 20 pages). With this feature, donors will be able to discover more pages there.
I don't feel like a middleman, when the owner of the page receives a new member, the first thing the system does is to send the name and e-mail of the new member to the owner of the page + the tier he subscribed.
Thanks for the feedback.

That's amazing :) Thank you very much for the recommendation!

Your comment just gave me an idea to add a new feature on the platform too. When the user withdraw the balance, he / she will need to inform the withdrawal bitcoin address. I can put a checkbox where the user can turn this address public on his page to accept anonymous donations too directly to his bitcoin wallet. The only problem here is the user who directly donated to him will need to contact him manually to receive the rewards / product, and the user will not be added to the charts, list, e-mail notifications, etc. But this can work like a tip jar for the creator.
