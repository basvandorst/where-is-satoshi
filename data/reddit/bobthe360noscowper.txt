I'm still confused but heres what I know so far. In this pool If I am mining and someone finds a block then everybody gets a share of the block. The block is a fraction of a bitcoin.

So here's my idea of this someone mines a block anyone who has a share gets part of that block. The higher the share the more you get. The block is pretty much a fraction of a bitcoin. 
Is that right?

Alright Thanks
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:44:30
Yes no ASIC and I'm using my GPU which is a GTX 970
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:47:59
Oh sorry Windows 7.
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:46:26
I'm using Windows and GUI miner. 
My driver is 376.33 Geforce Game Ready.

Oh ok So if you mined solo you would get 12.5 bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:45:15
If blocks are mined every 10 minutes how come I never get any notification of a payout on the site I'm using?
I know I mined for atleast 30 minutes.

Yeah, but it's my first day. I'm gonna save up for one that's around $200 or $300 bucks but for now, I'm gonna use my GPU. The thing is 
I'm supposed to get 650 MH/s but only get 100.
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:03:05
I'm definitely gonna get an ASIC.
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:48:42
So when I mine for 24hrs I'll get the share of the block? 
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:59:08
Well, I'm getting an Antminer S7. So you are saying that I don't need a GPU?
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:24:58
OK, thanks for saving my GPU.
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:25:39
What do you mean? I'm new.

So if I bought a bitcoin from them for $150 and then sold it back to them for $1700 I'm confused on how they would make money.
@_date: 2017-05-14 04:11:38
They don't care that they would lose money when you buy it? Or when you sell them it when it's worth $1700?
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:27:49
I mean after it drops to like $150 it would go to $1500. Also, don't people buy it when it's cheap then wait for it to go  up to $1500 and sell it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:38:08
I'm just asking for an estimate of how low it could drop before it goes up.
