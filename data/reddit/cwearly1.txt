Yup! Mainly wanted to spark a conversation about it. Got some rounded advice. Yeah if it dips back to 8 or 9 I’ll dump a bit more in instead

Yeah I’ll grab one of the websites instead of an external. For what I want there’s no risk getting hacked of a couple bucks. Later down the line the investment could pay for its own external to keep it safer

Right, I'm not an investor or savvy with money. But I figured why not have some fun with a tenner and see what happens to it down the road.

Oh, lol, never mind. It was one changetip for 200 bits a long time ago. Yeah that's definitely not worth anything now aha

So can I buy like $10 of BC and just let it sit for a decade?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:36:08
Perhaps I'm confused, but I meant $10US, whatever that is in BC. OF course the Wallet too I suppose.
I mean, a toss of a $10 die roll at least isn't any loss, really, if it all busts.

True. I don't have a sizeable (or existing) savings to invest with.
And actually, I have Bitcoin PMs from reddit from a year+ ago... where are those and how do I consolidate them, if that's even a possible thing?

I wish I was a decade older and financially able to have done this years ago at the age I am now (of course who would’ve thought this would happen), but in ten years I’ll be glad I did this today :)
