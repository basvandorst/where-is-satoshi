There are some vocabulary issues with your question.
A standard bitcoin transaction is a message, comprised of txn inputs to an address, being re-assigned to new outputs.  To validate the authenticity of the message, it is cryptographically signed by the private key of the related public key that the ledger shows owns those inputs.
If a thief has your private key, they can also sign your txn's, and therefore are able to re-assign "your" coins to a new address in the ledger.

Some wallets use sets of random words for the creation of the random private key number, so it is possible to create a mnemonic, although it is often an insecure solution to this problem.

If someone has your private key, then they can do the correct math (sign) to move those coins.
Coins are only "safe" if you are the only holder of that key, or if you are using multi-sig.

Incompressible fluid is a good metaphor, when speaking in equations.
So MV = PQ, but the fluid in our case is compressible, so V in standard economics was 1V, and in Bitcoin its potentially ∞V.
But also in Bitcoin M is fixed at eventually 21M
So really 21M * ∞V = PQ
Where Q is our true bullshit number
Solving for P 
P = The intrinsic value of a Bitcoin confirmation, and P &gt; 0

A rough guess would be:
 - 6 months = 365/2 * 24*6 = 26,280 blocks
 - 50,000 txn backlog desired
 - 500 spam txn's needed to maintain backlog per block confirmed
50,000 txns + (500 txn/block * 26,280 blocks) = 13,190,000 txns
@ network fee cost of 0.0001 BTC = 1,319 BTC
@ $250/BTC market price = $330K
So somewhere between 300K and a Million is my guess.  Pennies for big fish.

I created a spreadsheet that is a walk-through of the the SHA-256 compression function, as a method to teach myself the details of how it works.  PM me if you want a copy.

@_date: 2015-07-21 02:20:46
There was only one confirmation I heard of where a double spend occurred at shapeshift.io
Again, you have to remember that a double spend will typically only ever effect a transaction where the recipient doesn't wait for 1 confirmation.   So for small dollar value items, its the equivalent of accidentally accepting a counterfeit bill.  In the bitcoin world its statistically very rare compared to fiat.

I think it is a %, but I don't understand it either.
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:15:32
Well my reply was half bullshit, but in reality ∞ is some value related to how many parent/child spends you could cram into one block.  With the block size currently limited at 1mb, V is limited by both of these factors.
So moon price should still be theoretically possible.

1 - Call them
2 - Use encrypted email
3 - Multi Sig
    Ask them for a full public key
    Create a 1 of 2 Multi-Sig
    Send the Multi-Sig a small amount
    Send them your public key, redeem script and MS address
    They independently derive the multi-sig address, and it must match..if it does they spend the input
    If you see it spent, then pay to the normal bitcoin address for the public key

I don't think so, as you'd see a ton of OP_Return txn's in the current stress test.  I've not heard of anyone reporting that, but I'll look into it.
The history shows a huge number of UTXO being created at each stress test.  This one though looks to be the consolidation of those transactions.  That seems to make sense.

Couldn't you just upgrade bitcoin to store the hash of a txn, instead of the txn itself, to get around this limit?
A hash could then represent one or many txn's.
One downside of this idea, would be that to spend txn's recorded like this, you'd need a more complex lookup to prove ownership of the txn you plan to spend.

Can someone explain how a debit card currently works on a technical level?  
My assumption is that there is a bank network where a card read does a lookup to bank, and validates the amount / location / pin, to approve a txn.  Then some type of handshake occurs, and everything is audited/reconciled.
I would think hacking something together that would allow a service using a multi-sig address and a centralized traditional bank account , would allow you to create a service where a bitcoin backed debit card service could be up and running with  minimal effort.
