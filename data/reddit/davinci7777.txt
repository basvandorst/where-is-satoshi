Goddammit none of you can extrapolate what I want by this data. What it means is that none of you in here have any money. None of you. Except between 1% and 0.1% (maybe slightly more due to this demographic but still)
This means we need to pay more attention to the rich because they have monopolized all wealth now and in future. This is not an opinion, it is a fact and we must be looking to them for liquidity and strong hands.

They have no value because they don't use pigeons or humans to make the request personally for the service /s all data is worthless 1's and 0's and have no meaning.
Yes people are dumb.

Bitcoin is gold with wings. It's a store of value that you don't have to smuggle up your ass crack to cross borders.
With BTC you can move overseas with millions of dollars with ease.

**If it's not like Bakkt and backed by physical BTC, then it is a fraud that does not support the BTC Ecosystem:**
*See here unbacked bitcoin derivatives:*

Yep, **derivatives** a.k.a "derived from" but not the actual real asset token. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 06:02:12
Derivatives or real tokens?
@_date: 2018-09-22 12:37:56
No it's not, you dumb fucking sheep. Banks and financial corporations like Goldman Sachs are masters of manipulating markets, that is one of their core business models. Banks and financial institutions do not play fair, they play dirty, it's business.
**They have been fined $321 billion in fines in 10 years, banks are not "fair" or "moral"**:
Not only that but we have decades of data demonstrating price manipulation of assets using derivatives. For example gold:
**1) 
**2) 
**3)

If you can carry lots of wealth across borders without having to hide it in your suitcase or up your butthole, that is already value. It's cheaper to store than Gold bullion by a longshot.
It's honestly not rocket-science.

Yes, if we as a community lose over the long-term, but because they underestimated BTC and don't own a majority of the tokens we can defeat the CME.
My aim was to raise awareness so we don't go into the fight blind. Knowledge is power.

That's a typo.

Hey guys! For some background on OP's post (he's actually very correct) check out this post made all the way back in January 2018. 
Wallstreet are playing dirty (trying to protect their monopoly on fiat money issuance).

They will bail out the countries by offering debt "to avert a crisis". It's about creating fear and then offering a solution (to the IMF's benefit).

Litecoin is on shaky ground as it is not certain if it really fills any niche.
