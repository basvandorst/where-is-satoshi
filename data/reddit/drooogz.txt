Looks awesome. Enough 007 style to get a lot of people interested.

We're in this for the long haul, they'll come around. Just like women's rights, segregation, legalizing weed and the Internet, big change takes big time. 
But yes, lots of work to do.

Where does the 75% value come from?
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:46:27
See if you can throw it on AWS, if it's worth it to you. You can speed the process way up if you've got some cash to throw at it.

Ahh OK, I see now. Thanks for helping me clear that up!
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:19:54
Ahh ha! Thanks for that. I was wondering if it was a function of bitcoin core or xt.
So if 75% is attained, xt will stop accepting blocks with a lower version number?
The one thing I don't get is, what happens if someone mines a block larger than 1 MB before the January date? Will it just not be accepted? What if the hash power from XT is say, 60%, but it's not January yet?
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:21:54
Where do these 75% and January 2016 figures come from? They seem arbitrary to me...

I am writing a block chain parser and just tallied that there are around 4 million addresses with a balance. Not exactly what you were looking for but that'll give you a sense.

I tried to do this using graphviz...just kinda ate up my memory instead. :)
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:57:47
Hmm, interesting. 
Yup, fully synced, though I gave up after having it running for a day and only having uploaded about 200mb. I might need to leave it open longer, or there might just be no demand right now.

How long was your node running to upload over 4tb?
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:46:55
How do you manage to upload that much? I'd love to help, but even after port forwarding my router, I only connect to about 15 peers, and all of them have the blockchain already synced. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:21:59
Nice, I'm putting this in my bag of tricks. :)

I like this...thank you. :D

It was just the block pages, so only 254,194 requests...came out to about 3 gigs of data, and I saved them all to disk so I don't have to request them again. I also sent him a tip, 'saul goodman.

This is great. A lot of people I've talked to have brought up the question of what gives Bitcoin value. This is exactly it, it's transactional ability. It can move from place to place without limits, which is more value than gold will ever have.

The speed at which the price recovered says a lot about how much the market has stabilized. Last crash took days and days to recover back the the original price.

Our brains don't like to follow logic...I did the same thing. :/

Should work, I had a similar scare and it still worked after finding it.

Here's what you can figure out about a transaction. The to and from address, the amount, the fee, the date and time, and the IP it was broadcasted from. The thing is, if you buy some coins from an exchange and they record that address, those coins are "tainted", and can be followed through the blockchain until they reach another known address. For example, if I buy bitcoins through Mt.Gox and then send them to address abc, the government knows the coins at address abc are mine. If I then send them to address 123, which the government somehow knows is related to drugs (idk how, but let's just say they do), there's a high probability you bought some drugs. However, the beauty of bitcoin is that the address 123 can always be changed to address 456, and still be going to the same person, and the government has no idea now who the address 456 belongs too. In addition, if I go from address abc-&gt;def-&gt;hij-&gt;klm-&gt;nop-&gt;123, there's no way to prove that I was the one to buy the drugs.

Doing a getblockhash requires messing with the scriptSig, to be honest I was to lazy to deal with learning that. I also did it on a virtual machine, so not enough ram for blockparser. I agree it certainly wasn't the best way of going about it though.

Yes, it was the debug output when the chain got reorganized. I knew we must have reached it because my CPU went crazy for a couple seconds invalidating all those transactions in the orphan chain.

About a gig, ~17 million rows.

I figured as much. Bitcoin feels invincible if we would collectively need to sell $500 million worth in order for the price to drop to 0. But the fact that there aren't that many offers to buy makes it...less invincible.
@_date: 2013-08-26 21:44:41
All I'm saving are the addresses, and the balance. None of the transaction or cryptographic information used to verify ownership. Note: of the 18 million addresses, only about 2 million have a balance.

What version you using? I think you need to get updated to 0.8.1
