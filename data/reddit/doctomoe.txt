When ever did the government need a moral case for banning something?
What if you wanted to be paid in sealed-off amounts of cocaine as a currency replacement? Differently from bitcoin, it would even have actual value.

The same way they find Johns and Drug users: Pose as faux users of bitcoin, start transactions, then come riding in with the cavalry.

You are aware that the US is one of around 198 nations on earth, and by far not the only relevant one? Can you imagine the chaos that happens when the Chinese ban bitcoin, and their population tries to flood the market with suddenly-dangerous assets they now hold (and ever did since the boom last year?)

While I would love to agree, I can't help but doubt that major governments banning all kind of transactions, with a hefty punishment for any who would ignore that rule, would effectively shut down the bit.
@_date: 2014-12-05 14:27:05
Essentially, this:
1. Ban bitcoin for any transactions, public or private
2. engage people trying to transact in bitcoin, with one side being a government shill
3. if they agree, jail them.
Will this kill bitcoin? Likely, no. But will it kill it for the big masses that need to be users to make the whole principle worthwhile? You betcha. Noone wants to do time with the Latin Kings or Aryan Brotherhood because they tried saving a few bucks in Mastercard fees.

Oh, that's easy. They'll just claim *any* transaction is US-based, because someone in the US worked on verifying it.

Thank you for your insight.
Just one follow-up question: Do you make use of Coinbase's wallet management via API calls? If so, how are your experiences?

A lot of useful information nontheless. Thank you 1 euro @_date: 2015-01-18 19:37:01
Just out of interest - as there is no reference number of any kind in btc transactions - how do you (more or less automatically) check for payment without having to run through a large amount of incoming transactions, all of which may or may not be business-related?
One wallet per customer? One wallet per invoice? Or good-old paper/pencil bookkeeping?

And it makes sense. Uber has trouble getting established in many places, and police has started targeting customers instead of drivers in Europe. 
Leaving a paper trail on my credit card report might not be what I would like to do as a customer.

This ain't strictly a typo, but you should really standardize on one way to express dates.

Wow, I really like the designs. Coming from Germany, I seem to have some issues with your offer, though...
1. A lot of our teams have "traditional" colors. I wouldn't be surprised if at least in the lower leagues, your designs might be considered "too colorful" (which would suck, admittedly). 
2. Usually, our teams are being financed by sponsors. Those guys want their logo to look great. You should post an example for your sponsoring print somewhere. (Edit: just found it, under "sample products". This might be just me, but I would have expected getting sent a sample there, not a photo gallery).
3. I do understand Asian sizes often differ dramatically from European sizes. What exactly is an XXL shirt for you? You have a sizing chart, but that one's only in imperial units, and most of the world uses metric ones (Frankly, I have only the slightest idea what 44" translates to).
4. At least here, many people avoid buying from abroad, because customs is a major PITA and is going to slap another ~30% on price *and* shipping. 
5. Who are your targeted customers? Single sportspeople? Teams? Wholesale distributors?

the bitcoin price is the lowest price someone is willing to sell for and someone else is willing to pay. If you got a lot of a commodity, such as BTC, and are willing to sell them all at a fixed, low price, you can essentially control the price level for a lot of transactions. 
This is what happened here.

I am confused. Is this "every VISA" or "every Canadian VISA"? They use both variants interchangeably.

Decent booze is relatively cheap in Germany as well. But we were talking about a bar, and that needs something better than booze. Booze is for getting senselessly drunk - real spirits are for enjoying the taste. 
Jim Bean is dirt cheap. Laphoraig 18 isn't.

You *can* have them send bitcoins to your wallet. ~~Confirmation is up to 20 minutes, though, and I doubt you want the customer to wait in front of your cashier for twenty minutes until their funds are cleared.~~
That's what bitpay is for: ~~rapidly-quick~~ quicker transactions.

As this works the same way as we handle commodities, it's a "oldest buy still in posession gets sold first" approach. 
Taxes are to be paid when you exchange a commodity for money, not after you get the money out of some virtual account. 
You may claim losses up to your gains within the period of your tax report (usually: one calendar year).
Background: I'm German, though not a tax advisor.
