Just checked your post history and you're a grown man. By the way you speak, and your command of grammar and spelling, I was seriously expecting a teenage boy.
I see the photo you posted for other men to compliment your sweet gainz. So we know you're out there looking for attention and validation.
Sorry that you aren't getting what you need in life and that you find it necessary to troll others for a temporary respite from the pain of what it is to be you.
