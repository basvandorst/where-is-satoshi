crypto world news thank you for the video, but please learn how to shoot a damn interview with better lighting and sound. 
this reminded me of watching first cuts in photography class.

Completely custom? That could get costly.
Feel free to remove this post if it is considered a promotion, but can get a Gunthy Gunbot for ~.1 BTC

“I do believe that governments will ultimately look at digitizing their currencies, and having them trade kind of like a digital token — a token of the US dollar — but the US dollar is still in a vault somewhere, or backed by the government,” said Cherecwich, who worked at State Street for 20 years before joining Northern Trust. “How are they going to do that? I don’t know. But I do believe they are going to get there.”
so, like Tether...but real?

Venmo is literally a useless app.
I will never understand: 
- how it gained traction as the defacto P2P cash app amongst millennials
- why people who use it think it's better than PayPal
- why you cannot send money from PayPal to a Venmo account (or vice versa) when they are backed by the same company
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:01:36
It is owned by PayPal. There is nothing *useful* that Venmo does that PayPal does not do already. Link to your bank account? Check. Send money to friends/family for free? Check.

I was being a tad sarcastic about the "pump" part, but he did mention BTCP recently...This is the interview...
Not the greatest production quality video, but the content is fascinating.

Look, no one should be giving him any airtime on this topic. You wanna talk about hype? It's purely sensationalist. LOOK WHAT SMART RICH GUY WARREN BUFFET HAS TO SAY ABOUT BITCOIN?!?!?!?! He literally admits he doesn't understand the technology, even comparing BTC to paper checks because "they too transfer value." 
People aren't pissed because he calls it gambling, people are pissed because an uninformed geriatric who failed to invest in some of the most revolutionary technology companies of our time (Google , Amazon) thinks his opinion on BTC matters at all.

I used PayPal for P2P payments long before Venmo was a thing and still do to this day. PayPal's mobile app + desktop experience are thoughtful and well-designed.
Have you ever tried to use the Venmo desktop site? It's an absolute mess (feels like a half-finished website). If I am sitting at my computer and a friend sends me money over Venmo, why does it have to be so difficult to log in and check on my desktop computer? 
Edit: I just got an email stating Venmo is discontinuing all payment features on the desktop site: 
Also, why does Venmo need to know the purpose for every payment I send? I know you can just lie, but this still feels extremely creepy to me that you cannot send money without stating a purpose, even if it can be faked.

These guys are some of the best in the industry. 
They have flown numerous members of the bitcointalk forum over to their factory so these miners can report back and provide better support for others in the community.
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:35:15
So you can use the money people send you from their PayPal accounts to buy things online from actual merchants without ever sending the money to your bank account? 
If they made PayPal and Venmo compatible this wouldn't even be an issue.

CW's reactions were over the top but honestly, who fucking cares about this "we are all Satoshi" banter? Does this concept really need to be explained or argued about at a conference attended by crypto developers? 
This whole topic needs to be put to rest.

CNBC and other news sites need to stop giving him any airtime on this topic when it is clear he doesn't even try to understand the underlying technology. Also, Bill Gates was an absolute laugh during this morning's interview.
"If there was an easy way to short it, I would." 
Sounds like you need a better broker, or at least one that understands where to trade BTC futures, Billy.

you didn't hear? he's been all about the BTCP &gt; XMR pump lately

Bitcoin was not designed for the Warren Buffetts of the world. Period.
It does not provide him with the same economic utility as it does for others.

Same. And he did more than just sell coins without following the fincen laws he knew existed...BHO is a controlled substance...the list goes on.
Messy and unfortunate situation for someone so actively pushing adoption, wish him the best.

Nice interview, you sure told them what it's all aboot.
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:24:35
Because it makes for good sensationalist TV... this is CNBC after all. He is way too sensible to fall into that trap.
