What do you mean when you say PoW is the hard part? I think i know, but i just want to make sure. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:06:01
Not sure how this relates to opt-in privacy enhancement. If you did an opt-in privacy tx, how will the cops know it was you? When you use Tor, how do the cops know its you? They dont, thats the point. Right? So it doesent matter whether they like it or not. It doesent affect you.

Well theres an ignorant post if i ever saw one. The blocksize limit is there precisely because bitcoin cares. Ethereum does not, thats why they hardfork on a whim and even consider sharding a good idea. They dont care. And their blockchain isnt worth a damn :) Was there anythign else?
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:15:10
I think we are getting into the end user experience now, which doesent really depend on wether privacy is opt-in or not on the protocol level. The end user experience depend on the wallet used, and there probably will be easy to use, highly private wallets or wallet functionality, even if its opt-in on the protocol level. It will probably just be a flag, or perhaps the wallet will just do it by default. Its hard to say how this will be done excactly and there will probably be minor nuances between each wallet.

Bitcoin is the all-rounder. Can be used anonmously, open source, settlement appeal, but can be used for standard transactions atm. It has a thin transaction footprint compared to other crypto and is arguably more scalable and so on. I dont know if it will win.
@_date: 2016-08-22 05:28:39
i think its called camel hair
@_date: 2016-08-25 05:23:57
Bitcoin does not have more or less capacity than other blockchains. But it takes a conservative approach and is more open about the scalability issue. Whereas other blockchains, like bitcoin in the beginning, run with either no limit on blocksize, or a dynamic one, which is practically the same. 
And when people ask you why you dont bother with security, and you respond with, its too costly. Im not sure we should take you seriously anymore.

Im not sure i understand the last part of your post. How much of an increase in privacy is forcing everyone to participate in tumbling at the protocol layer? Furthermore what are the drawbacks in terms of scaling? Also it seems wasteful to tumble by default, but allowing people to unmask after the fact? Is that how it works?
@_date: 2016-08-23 21:16:48
But who wants to educate? Where is the fun in that? It is more fun trying to control things. Or perhaps fun is not the correct word. Working towards control and using punishment seems more natural. Except when you say it out loud, it doesent.

@_date: 2016-08-25 22:13:05
Maybe not anything specific. Perhaps just a general observation of how people have behaved, shilling alt-coins under the guise of "Bitcoin wont scale, this coin is much better. It does not have the blocksize issue" etc. I think it scared alot of people. Have a nice day.

Bitcoin is going to be a multi generational thing. Do you really think its going to make you rich beyond your wildest dreams? Only a few, very lucky people, accomplished that. Of course it would be too good to be true if you think bitcoin will just make you insta rich. Why do you think this way? Is it because you are lazy? Is it because you are insecure? Get out there and earn money instead. Get some skills. Get some experience. Instead of relying on Lottery tickets and gambling ala bitcoin investment to change your life, because it most likely wont.

The concept of taint has been debunked. Its not an issue. Im still not sure how opt-in tumbling do not give you plausible deniability. Lets say that someone could prove you did a private transaction. I mean thats not illegal?

Have this journalist no self respect. Why did he chose a title like this? Its clickbait, none-other.
The problem is the title makes it look as if a wall-street company is doing buisness with the Factom blockchain, when in reality its just a startup developing an API targeted at Wall Street. Thats it. Wall Street is not involved, but they want them to be, as far as i can tell. And good luck with that i suppose. But goddamn this title is misleading.

@_date: 2016-08-29 02:59:39
Are we really going to discus this? Bitcoin has halvings approxmitely every 4 years. You heard about those? In reality block rewards wont stop until at least a hundred years by current estimates, they will just turn into fractions of a bitcoin gradually. Thus i rest my case, bitcoins are going to take longer and longer to mine.
For reference

If you do not reuse adresses, how will someone be able to deanonymize you? I can understand if you tell a group of people to send money to the same adress, they can reveal who you are if the cops ask them. But if everyone gets a different adress how is your privacy weakened? I assume thats what you meant.
@_date: 2016-08-31 05:31:13
Not sure it would be a good idea. Blockchains have more to do with property rights, and excerising them. A vote is not really property. We dont need a blockchain for it. Votes are  only relevant in a short period of time. I dont know where im going with this.

@_date: 2016-08-31 03:36:28
Im sure there wont be any discrimination if thats what you mean. Coinbase or any merchant or service for that matter have no incentive to block a privacy enhanced transaction as far as i can see. Because you are innocent until proven guilty, if you *are* doing "evil doing", the transaction is private, so you are safe. There may be a higher probability that the funds, when privacy is enabled stems from illegal activity but they cannot prove it, so you are safe.
@_date: 2016-08-28 03:39:21

Privacy is an individual choice. The means to achive it can be provided, if people dont want to use it, thats their buisness.
I have a deeper problem with your argument tho. Because you suggest people cannot take care of themselves. And you may be right. Some people wont know whats good for them. But i dont think the solution is to force habits on them. Especially not if it turns out there can be legit use cases for not doing a private transaction. Im thinking of the costs associated with them, in terms of transaction size and what have you. Maybe some people want their tx to be public. We just dont know and should not force privacy.

Realistically i dont think fees will drop. SegWit will provide the scale to prevent them from rising dramatically. I think regardles of scale, if bitcoin continues to gain traction, fees are only going to keep getting higher and higher. It is likely we wont use the bitcoin blockchain in the future for casual spending. Simply because there is no inventive to do it. This is all speculative tho.

Its still better than the legacy system, with brokers, and bogged down regulation. Here you get a token directly from the warehouse, and they dont even have to keep a database of who owns the oil in question. The token is redeemable for x amount of oil, and thats brilliant. Cuts out the middle man, and allows the warehouse to focus all their resources in expanding storing and securing the asset, rather than keeping track of ownership and worry about counterfeiting and so on.

I take offense when bitcoin is mentioned next to paypal, visa, etc. Its not a payment method. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:38:56
I think mining will inevitably become specialised. Just like every other industry. The people who have the lowest running costs typically end up being the biggest. Its possible someone - bitmain? - is lightyears ahead of the competition and can grow at a tremendous pace. Im not sure what this means for bitcoin tho, since the incentives to be honest are  arguably there regardless of how big you are. If anything the bigger your operation is, the more you have at risk.

Excuse me, but trying to shame people in a technical discussion is bad. I would like to hear what you consider a safe blocksize. With research to back it up. For example, UTXO growth, chain size growth, bandwidth requirement, propagation time, orphan rate and so on.
Other than that SegWit comes with an increase to throughput so its not like people arent being heard. What do you think a proper fee to use the blockchain might me? thats also an interesting question. But i have a feeling you are not concerned about these things. Are you?
@_date: 2016-09-27 15:42:40
Look if you tried to compete with the current banking system you would be put in jail. Bitcoin succeeds because there is no central point of failure. There is no central figure to jail or servers to confiscate. Its a decentralized autonomous organisation. Take that, tyrants.
@_date: 2016-09-30 02:36:26
Yea thats what i was sort of getting at. The reason it worked for this guy was actually because he paid a fee too little. So already 3 blocks had been found without a confirmation for him. So uh. Yea.

@_date: 2016-09-28 22:41:40
You make it sound as if on-chain scaling has no drawbacks. But someone has to propagate the blocks, validate them, and keep them (forever, because thats how this works). So when you want to increase blocksize, you are increasing the burden on these people. So thats why it makes sense not to frantically increase it at least. 
The fee pressure we have now is excellent. $0.07 is probably the average fee for fast confirmation. I think that seems redicolously fair. If/when SegWit activates it comes with a cushion for fee pressure, so it will most likely not increase significantly for a while. And thats good, because stable fee market is superior to an unstable one.

The US is the best suited out of everyone right now to be the guardian of the internet.

The outcome will probably be the opposite. When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. They are just going to apply regulations and thats not what we need. Bitcoin has existed for 8 years now. And the industry is maturing on its own. When it is finally mature, after a decade or so, government will move in and demand everyone to do what they are already doing PLUS more useless stuff that stifle competition and innovation. Its fucking sad:)

so instead of the US seizing domains, they have shown restraint, domains have been seized that clearly broke the law. When UN takes over, every government is able to seize domain. So now you have the US seizing domains that break US law. And you have  china, russia, saudi arabia seizing domains that they simply d8nt like. It will be like youtube where people flag videos because they dont like them, and they get taken down because youtube just sont give a damn. This is how the internet will look in 10 years under UN authority, except it will be entire domains that get taken down. You think reddit has a chance in its current form under UN authority? nope.

Not sure where you are getting this from. Increasing the blocksize limit does not solve scalability, so its there for technical reasons. But we still dont have an answer to scalability so Core is making a proposal to increase blocksize soon.

@_date: 2016-09-05 01:49:57
Sorry didnt watch the video. But i wanted to chime in anyway, call me a bitch.. i dont care..
The blocksize limit is not really the problem. Its a symptom of the problem. In reality bitcoin revolves around the ledger. Its the CENTRAL component of the network. It has to grow for people to be able to use it but the problem is everyone ideally has to store the ledger as well because that increases security. But as the ledger grows this becomes less and less likely that people will keep the ledger. So the dilemma is, if we restrict growth of the ledger people wont be able to use it, but if we dont restrict growth people wont be able to use it in the end either. So a dynamic blocksize cap, what does it solve? It doesent solve anything. We need dynamic blockchain size. Dynamic ledger size because that is the real issue.
@_date: 2016-09-30 00:22:29
Even if you have fat fingers. You have ~10 minutes if you provided a high fee, to doublespend the money and get it back before its destiny is sealed. This actually happened yesterday when someone sent $5k to the wrong adress. He quickly doublespent it and got back control. This is only possible because of the relatively lax confirmation times. A plus because of bitcoins otherwise irreversbility. The 10 minute window can be crucial but i dont know how much it matters i n the long run tho.

If the proposal is good enough why not. Ideally anyone should be able to submit a proposal. But they should probably get Core with them, because most people run their client. Nobody would feel confident running Bitcoin Unlimited at this point  i imagine. Especially not with the problems Ethereum is having with clients running out of memory and hashrate dropping significantly.. Really got to make sure you are using the safest client. And bitcoin unlimited just isnt it, yet. It needs to prove itself first.
@_date: 2016-09-22 20:16:34

@_date: 2016-09-20 21:16:38
Did they hurt anyone?
@_date: 2016-09-13 21:24:30
Its hard to argue against that the lower the requirements are for running a node, the more likely people are to do it. More nodes makes bitcoin stronger. Also bitcoin is not very far in its development, there is no telling what kind of technologies or adoption will come in the future. However, if we go all in on on-chain transactions now, then if/when lighter technology comes around, and adoption by mainstream payment providers, then the "bloating" of the blockchain cannot be undone. We have pruning, but that only ignores not that problem.
I think it makes sense to wait with an increase in blocksize because first of all the current fee pressure is perfect. 7-10 cents for a high priority transaction makes sense. It avoids the tragedy of commons, which means it invites people to be frugal. It invites people to think outside the box when it comes to scale, and it invites existing payment system infrastructure to open up to bitcoin. All these things are good if not essential for bitcoin adoption longterm. Feel free to flame me now.

The debit cards are cool. Right now you go from bitcoin to debit card, and debit cards i imagine use the legacy system to settle. eventually the debit cards will just use bitcoin as well to settle, and gone are the days of the legacy banking system. Just have to sort that scaling issue out.

@_date: 2016-09-05 07:53:55
Cant say i agree. Maybe i dont understand it, but i dont see a practical reason for permanent inflation. Besides the only way you are going to get support for that, is by making it so small, it doesent matter anyway. And a dynamic blocksize limit is not that interesting anyway. We need to think outside the box here. The problem is that when the bottom layer is used, the total size of the ledger increases. But the integrity of the ledger relies upon the number of people keeping it, to a large degree. So its a dilemma. Restrict blocksize/blockchain growth, which results in reduced bottom layer use. Or, set the blocksize free, which will increase bottom layer use, but also challenge the integrity of the blockchain over time, making the bottom layer and network as a whole less attractive to rely on.

Bitcoin is stepping up the game, and already people are buying drugs, guns, whatever they want with bitcoin, thats freedom and power.
Bitcoin is about freedom and power for the individual. The current banking system is about power for the elite, at the expense of everyone else. Imagine that, we are just pawns in the end currently. What an undignifying life.

please call your congresman asap and get them to contact Ted Cruz who is leading the charge on this. He is fighting to keep control over the internet in US hands.

When that happens, there is usually a breakout brewing. You can open a bitcoin chart and look at the Bollinger Bands indicator. If the bands are really tight, that means price has narrowed down, and its either going to drop alot of rise alot. Thats what usually happens. Here is an example. Notice when the bubble around the candles is tight the price usually leaps up or down.

Thats a good question. I dont think it will. Im guessing you have many individual inputs? In any case i think its a good idea to consolidate them. Perhaps you should wait for SegWit so you can consolidate into a SegWit adress.
@_date: 2016-09-01 07:44:28
I dont understand the question. Bitcoin community is a poorly defined term for example. Governance, and the protocol itself is built to take input from individuals anyway, not groups of people.

What is the benefit of that. Why do we trust miners so much? Look at what they are doing in ethereum. As soon as the incentives no longer line up they turn on the network and begin to mine empty blocks because that is more profitable short term. Just an example.

Nobody said SegWit will solve scaling on implementation day, but it doesent have to, and nothing can afaik. Because pretending that a hard blocksize limit increase will solve anything down the road is equally ignorant. Not only does SegWit provide a means to increase throughput here and now, it also addresses several issues and paves the way for longer term scaling.
The hard blocksize limit increase is just a knee-jerk reaction that wont actually solve anything. Good bye. I hate discussing this. Its literetately flogging a dead horse.
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:42:56
yes i think this means a SegWit tx will be ~300 byte total like a normal tx. But the SegWit can split up its data so only say 100 byte goes in the old blocksize limit and the rest goes in the new blocksize limit. So if blocks are total 2mb, it will still be able to contain as many tx as if the blocksize limit was hardforked and we didnt have SegWit at all. You know what i mean?
@_date: 2016-10-10 15:15:54
I may no longer be interested in bitcoin at that point, unfortunately. The network effect would be lost, so you may as well sell, for one thing. But that a consensus can split over a technical issue is also detrimental to the potential future of the idea. I mean bitcoin is supposed to follow the optimal path. And if there is no clear optimal path, it should do nothing at all. Splitting is always the worst outcome.
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:57:55
If MGT has figured out a way to profitably mine BTC i think thats awesome. But i sincirely doubt that they have. In the end they are betting on being able to accumulate more BTC by mining, and cheaper, than if they bought them OTC. Isnt that what mining is about? In either case i wonder what kind of turnover they can have with a BTC mining operation. It does not seem like a prudent endeavour from an investor persptive tbh.

Because i dont think that even 32mb blocks can accomplish this and that would be above the cutoff for most people to maintain a node.

Bitcoins anarchistic tendencies have always been a benefit so far, in contrast to crypto coins that have more top down approach. For example Ethereum has a top down approach to governance and as such it has become inherently interventionist. The excact thing crypto currency was invented to avoid.

I thought SegWit was the compromise. 4mb blocks?
@_date: 2016-10-04 23:21:07
Cryptocurrency sucks. Its not peer to peer. Or rather its not fire and forget like bittorent. So its more like a server. You should be able to start your wallet, spend or recieve then close. But depending on when you last opened it can take days. And dont even get me started on another 5 years where blockchain and utxo will be even more cumbersome.
@_date: 2016-10-31 20:11:43
Are you sure its amount traded per year? Because last i checked Silver had a 14B market cap (This chart says 20b, and silver has been increasing this year..). But this market cap can be traded many times back and forth per year, right?
Lets assume that bitcoin has a daily volume of $50,000,000 (Its probably more) then in a year that is ~$17B Holy crap. Imagine if you got just a fraction of that. Anyway, im out. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2016-10-13 04:48:20

I think what he means is that the pool is neutral and its the individual miners who flag for stuff. But im not sure.
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:15:39
Look. Every bitcoin transaction is spam. Im not kidding. It certainly is poluting. It leaves a permanent record in the blockchain. But the way this thing works is if everyone keeps a copy of the blockchain. So it just keeps growing and growing and growing. This is so ironic, we really want people to use the blockchain as little as possible. The real hodler does not let other people use the blockchain. Its his. And should be used as little as possible.
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:17:20
Yes. You cant think.
For example, raising the blocksize limit is not scaling bitcion. It will just become centralized that much faster. And what do you mean when "on-chain scaling should come first?". I think that is excactly what is happening. SegWit, Schnorr possibly next. These things truly increase scale and magnifies the blocksize limit increases. It makes sense to have these in place first. And the timing is proper. Fees = 10-20 cents. Not too bad. They gonna stay around that for a while. Perhaps until Schnorr is developed, and a blocksize limit increase can be done.

Slow down buddy. If you have a guy gambling every day and he sends multiple tx per day, when he could bundle them, then he is taking space from others. the fee gives him an incentive to not waste blockspace like that and give room for more people.
@_date: 2016-10-16 14:36:16


citation needed. nevertheless pausing the system to upgrade seems like something that shouldnt be done unless its absolutely critical or enough of an upgrade its worth the inconveniance to everyone :)
Core is ahead of everyone else in the space i think when it comes to understanding bitcoin. They have a reputation to consider, they want to be here for the long haul it seems. Just like me. Then you have Bitcoin Unlimited who can disappear just as fast as they appear, especially if there policies are second grade. They show up, change the network, then leave? Thats the worst form of anarchy.
Why not work together with the scientists and engineers from Core and figure out a decent solution? What bitcoin unlimited and before that Classic and XT boils down to is, "if we can enough people on board, science, reason and evidence wont matter". Except it will, even if you ignore it, but thats a different discussion :)

This sort of thing is absolutely an attack considering the many benefits of SegWit and the warnings against hardforking 
@_date: 2016-10-12 22:11:29
I dont think thats correct. SegWit can put most of its tx outside the normal blocksize limit so to the miners your tx looks very small and you wont have to pay that much. At least thats what i gather. Im not 100% sure.
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:30:15
is the current limit even a problem yet?

Its because of habit. People still get into the habit of just submitting the fee they think is right i would argue. Even tho the fee market is relatively dynamic. I can understand if you make hundreds of tx per day its not prudent to do due diligence on fees. But should you be doing hundreds of tx per day to begin with, huh?

Last i checked bitcoin governance was decentralized and not in charge by a single company. It only looks that way. And it  creates some confusion and frustration among people who dont know because bitcoin development looks centralized but its not moving as fast as it would if it really was centralized. If you dont believe in decentralized governance i think you should switch to Ethereum.
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:28:00
That doesent answer my question. 
Will blocks be larger than 2mb with SegWit? You dont have to answer if you dont know
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:40:50
Thats a narrow way of looking at things. For example bandwidth is an abundant ressource more or less and its a constant, not growing vs blockchain and UTXO. And what segwit enables is to spend bandwidth rather than RAM when increasing throughput. So in terms of RAM and UTXO you actually get more tx for the same price with segwit so its more scalable.
@_date: 2016-10-14 19:19:17

I think these hackathons can be adequately described as attempting to corner the market. Because why are they doing it? What is their motivation? Do they want to see blockchain tech flourish? I sincerely doubt thats the motivation. They want to get developers and projects to a platform in which they hold a significant stake. I am of the opinion that Ethereum is simply a fancy scam. Decentralized scam, lets call it that. The only reason it works is because it can prey on unsuspecting bitcoiners.
@_date: 2016-10-11 23:06:56

@_date: 2016-10-12 21:59:23
Why would they fork tho?
@_date: 2016-10-15 15:53:24
It would not tho. The vanilla transaction format is large when it comes to UTXO footprint compared to SegWit. So if you increase the vanilla blocksize limit 100% without SegWit you get 100% faster growth of everything. Thats the opposite of scaling :) You make the problem even worse and the need for scaling even more urgent.

@_date: 2016-10-12 21:37:08

Anyone who use SegWit will get the benefits right away. 75% cheaper tx afaik. So adoption will be swift. Multisig on the other hand has taken longer to adopt, but thats also a niche transaction format. That is actually more expensive to use than P2pkh which most people use today. P2PKH will transform into the SegWit format rather quick i would imagine. And here is the thing. So lets say we increase blocksize limit first. Then we dont get the benefits of SegWit, and when it does come, everyone will have to adopt the SegWit format anyway. This is why im convincined that the guys who want a hard blocksize limit increase first at all costs are the ones that are stalling bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-10 15:09:46
SegWit seems good enough and its been under development for almost a year. Its so far along now that blocking it makes no sense i would argue. That being said its still unclear why ViaBTC is mining Bitcoin Unlimited. It does not neccesarily mean they are not in favor of SegWit. And if they are, it would be interesting to hear their rationale behind it.
@_date: 2016-10-10 16:46:46
When they eventually get enough hashing power, a real hardfork solution will be here and we hardfork anyway :D

Nothing has been blocked yet, nor has anyone aluded too afaik, lets keep that in mind.
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:55:35
There is no reason to do it all at once. SegWit is ready i presume, lets just get it adopted. It does not exclude a hardfork to increase blocksize limit.
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:15:34

Maybe a block was found? The 10 minute is an average figure. They can come with intervals of less than a minute as well because of variance.

how likely do you think a fork is? why are you asking these questions?  if someone is going to fork you are probably better off asking them since they will have the deteails. ie. will your trezor continue to work etc.

Large contracts would have to go under continuous security review i imagine. I dont know how this works, but if solidity interprets the contracts for you, i can see room for translation errors.

Ok so when it comes to short term throughput increases Bitcoin Core has laid out a road map that takes care of it. First part of that is the SegWit softfork which gives an additional 80% increase or so to throughput as well as several other benefits. That should keep fees from getting any worse for the next year or so. They are also far along with Schnorr sigs which is going to give an additional 20% increase i think because it makes transactions smaller a a whole :)
*Edit* And i would just like to add its great to see that engineers are actully working on bitcoin and making proposals and so on. This coin is far from dead.
@_date: 2016-10-12 03:06:15
Keep in mind that core is not a dictator. Why the fuck am i even telling yiu this. You are an expert. Anyway. The stalling is not Core's fault. They are only a bunch of advisers in the end, and engineers. I hate to use the term janitors but they maintain code as well. You seem to believe they can just propose 2mb hardfork or something and network will enable it but it wont, thats why they dont proposed it to begin with. I am happy to hear otherwise.

Ok that seems fair. So i guess blocks will not exceed 2mb as previously said. Certainly that could only be the case if the block was carefully constructed to contain very lightweight nearly SegWit only tx but then the throughput would also be even greater, like 2x+.

That depends on how you look at it. Because you can still spam the 2mb blocks, but then you spam the UTXO as well. You cant do that under segwit afaik. I think part of the reason Ethereum is hardforking next week is to reverse a spam attack that bloated the state or UTXO or whatever you want to call it, because it was too cheap to do it. This will happen in bitcoin if you just increase blocksize limit to 2mb or 4mb etc. :) You know what i mean?

The bitcoin logo is so cute :) who designed it? And then it Just became adopted by everyone. Makes No sense but i like it.

does it surprise you? the two are basically degens with a pc and an internet connection. and audience apparantly.

how edgy

ATM is Lightning participant No1. When you go to it and buy BTC, it does the neccesary mumbo jumbo to make you LN participant no. 2. Then you get home. And its up to you wether you want to exit LN with the coins, or wahtever the fack. Benefits of staying is when you wanna sell the BTC to the ATM you can do it instantly. And i imagine various merchants will tag along as well here, eventually there wont really be an incentive to not use LN because it does bitcoin transactions better than the blockchain and it has equal or better merchant adoption etc.

Yes, the tactics big blockers used were deplorable. Specifically promoting the notion that bitcoin would collapse if we didnt do what they said.
@_date: 2016-10-14 15:02:37
Sounds like r/btc tactics to me
@_date: 2016-10-19 06:29:32
Yes. The lightning devs are at least as smart as vitalik.

Weekend, and also, when price rise fast, everyone tends to hold their breath for a while. You know what i mean?

As far as i understand all Core can do is advise and maintain code. I dont think this will change based on the hashing power using Bitcoin Unlimited. I would be surprised if they suddenly get in favor of hardforks for example.
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:04:00
What does that mean?
@_date: 2016-10-19 07:07:58
oh they have a website? then we cant

Just vote for Trump. He is anti-establishment.
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:45:54
Of course you think you can think thats why you are stupid
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:48:03
Part of the speculation is that there will be 95% miner support in time i presume

I was asking a question originally and then you decided to join.
You say SegWit increases network trafic 4x but only gives 1.7x the transactions. Thats a fucking lie and you know it. And now you are backing out. GOOD RIDDANCE
@_date: 2016-10-09 06:57:24
You are most likely wrong.
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:00:56
Good question. I think it comes down to legitimacy. First of all I like the idea that the SEC isnt completely turned off by an Bitcoin ETF. If it happens i think it lends more legitimacy to the space which can spur further addoption.
@_date: 2016-10-02 09:25:51
Yea i wonder how a 13 year old stumbles upon bitcoin in 2009 ? I thought they only came when dogecoin was invented..
@_date: 2016-10-11 15:01:04
Someone did it just as a joke. Its a prank
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:08:00
Very good question. I think people are just going to chill.
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:18:58
A blockchain by itself is not worth anything. Its not interesting. Right?
And here you got Bitcoin with a 10B market cap, and it cant get any recognition apparantly. I think its cognitive dissonance at large.
@_date: 2016-10-15 23:20:22
Ok i see. But i think what i mean is that this guy apparantly made it seem as if miners are good, so its no problem letting them control blocksize i guess. But as you point out miners are only good because the incentives line up. With the miners being able to control blocksize limit, maybe it will screw with the incentives to be good, i dont know.

Keep in mind the Conference in Milan is a scaling conference and afaik RSK has little to do with scaling.
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:53:31
I still dont understand. Does that mean blocks wont become larger than 2mb?
@_date: 2016-10-12 22:03:05
I dont think there is stalling for SegWit specifically. Alot of people just didnt see a hardfork as a good solution. And i dont think it is. Im also skeptical of BU's approach (The worst thing is its not even a proposal, its just comming out of nowhere trying to establish authority wtf). SegWit is a good compromise as it can actually increase throughput here and now - well wallets have to adopt the tx format, but it would only take a few days -  and then it paves the way for further improvements AND most importantly it can be done as softfork.
