@_date: 2018-05-27 20:29:44
I am confusion
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:38:04
I have about 1500 in, its now down to 1200 and I’m also thinking about investing a little more, just waiting it out for a little to see what the price does.

Can’t understand what’s wrong with a bank trying to protect itself from losses. They still allow you to use debit cards, you just can’t use credit.

This guys is clearly trying to get your bank login info. Up to you wether or not he gets it haha

This kinda helps OP’s point. The popular media back then was clearly clueless as to what the internet was and what it could become, asking questions in a sort of condescending manner towards the internet itself, but now it’s become a necessity for our society.

Yeah by direct deposit I meant that they will let you take the money out of crypto and give you the cash equivalent in your CAD bank account. Msg me if you need any help

Open a Coinsquare account and send your crypto from Coinbase to Coinsquare. They allow direct deposits to Canadian bank accounts.

Well most banks won’t allow credit cards for crypto purchases, and you can’t blame them. They’re just protecting themselves from potential losses.

I agree with everyone else, I would get that money out of Coinbase ASAP, just in case that it actually was a mistake
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:44:43
No need to be picky here... the guy is just asking for advice on how he can sell his crypto. I think that’s pretty clear bud.
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:02:34
Just use your debit card...
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:33:24
Nah the post makes sense, I have a Coinbase account here in Canada and we cannot sell crypto through Coinbase.
