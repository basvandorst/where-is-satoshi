Please, add also those unspendable due to current fees.

8% seems abusive to me for a zero-risk loan.
They only have to sell your deposited coins if you don't pay or the price drops. They don't have to repossess and sell your car or other property.

Great! Let's celebrate there are less and less transactions in each block.

Why did you pause the project for three years?
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:06:01
Wow! It's true!

bcash is the mother of all shitcoins.

As a thought experiment; in the rare case that S2X was successful and S1X disappeared, does that mean that all Bitmex clients would lose all their money?

Yes. Always good to have more options. The problem is all these p2p exchanges have tiny liquidity.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:25:41
Yes, but be careful when buying bitcoin. They also list bcash with the name bitcoin cash. Do not buy the wrong bitcoin.

Say users that hodl 75% of bitcoin, not 75% of users.
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:20:18
Bitcoin is not about users. It's not a democracy. It's about economic majority. Full stop.
