They are not using or holding or even know of Bitcoin. Get over it. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:04:19
A lot of people selling. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:35:39
What is that supposed to mean? What did i say that is somehow connected to my account age?
Yes, i create a new account every few months and only post with 1 at the same time. Is that somehow not allowed by you?
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:41:48
Move away from the keyboard and get some fresh air. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:24:55


Jesus man. You have no idea if it will! Nobody knows. 
Who the hell downvotes this? Why?
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:19:40
Sorry, i don't pay attention to the other coin but how is it dead? This post made me check the price and it's like 580 dollars or something. Am i missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:20:21
Haha no it's not. Half of it is ridiculous advice based on memes and hope. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:47:14
All good names are long gone. Save your money. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:12:37
I can't wait for the day where this buy the dip meme dissapears. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:14:16
What's with all the odd dates? Looks like you cherry picked them to get the graph you wanted. 
And still then none of it proves Bitcoin is not in a bubble. I have no idea if it is or not but that nonsense chart suddenly won't change my mind. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:10:01
Fair enough. I disagree and do that by actually spending my coins. Using it for what it's made for. And i think it's sad that most people don't. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:24:00
This could easily be the worst tip one could think of. Amazing how you managed to do that. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:05:35
Huh? Excuse me?
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:21:28
I use Bitwala. It makes sense if you own coins and spend them. 
If you buy coins with fiat, send the coind to them and they convert it to back fiat then it's just silly. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:25:42
I use Bitwala. Seems decent enough. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:19:07
Believing bitcoin will go up forever is silly.  
But indeed it does not matter when to buy as it's a gamble anyway. 
It most likely won't stop going up now but nobody knows for sure. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:28:22


You answered your own question. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:27:16
Why did you come here for advice?
If that's not exciting then simply keep your coins and take the gamble and stop bothering us. 
It seems you simply want to hear sone kind of guarantee that it will go up forever. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:40:51
I bet he posts here. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:47:06
And how will that happen when everybody hoards their coins?
This sub's mantra is "hodl" and yet everyone here demands Bitcoin will go mainstream. Do you see the problem?
Edit: i wish we could discuss things as adults instead of downvoting someone for having a different opinion. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:24:41
Man, calm down. He is ignoring one thing completely. Bitcoin can go down. He pretends it can't. 
Keep in mind this guy isn't some big whale investor who holds a crystal ball. It's a 20 year old with 1 or 2k in Bitcoin who acts like it will go up forever based on nothing but hopium. 
Yes, invest in Bitcoin if you want to. Nothing wrong with it. But getting all euphoric because of that completely flawed posts about future riches is just stupid and will end in tears and dissapointment. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:48:20
Can you please back up why or how i am a shill? Some examples of what or who i'm shilling for would be great. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:20:43
No. 
And downvoted. 
Ok, LBC is perfectly safe! Nothing can go wrong whatsoever. You can't be scammed. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:38:40
Until they do. 
Oh downvoted. Because that will never happen or something?
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:36:25
Worthless info without evidence. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:49:30
Buy a chunk and hope it goes up. 
There is a meme on this sub that keeps getting repeated. Dollar cost averaging. While there won't be anything wrong with it there is also no evidence whatsoever that it's better than just buying a big amount in 1 go. 
It's just people parroting each other. 
In the end nobody here can help you because no one has a clue what will happen in the future. Absolutely no one. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:37:15
Oh sorry, no clue. I'm European so that's possible. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:55:48
How should we know exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:45:38
Translation: 10 people in Venezuela might be using Bitcoin. 
How does this ridiculous Venezuela Bitcoin myth get upvoted to the top every single time?
I remember the last thread like this. There was even a guy from Venezuela posting how these articles are total bullshit. But funny enough his comment was at the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:58:02
Well, because of your detailed post i'm sure we can figure it out for you. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:47:44
Great analysis. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:52:28
People like you always lose their money. You're an angry teen trying to get rich quick. 
You won't. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:27:55
This could be a bubble. Nobody knows. Neither do you. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:13:31
Wow. You're one angry teen. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:17:38
Yes. Scam. Of course. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:41:43
A shill??? How? Or what? What am i possibly shilling for??
God, some of you people are just crazy. 
Post an opinion? SSSSSHHHIIIL!!!1!
No seriously, what would i be shilling for based on my posts? Please tell me. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:08:28
You REALLY have to be in the right position to make that work out. Conversions, fees, bank fees and what not. Usually it's not worth it. And when it is then many will jump on it and it will be over quickly. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:59:28
People like you make Bitcoin look like a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:57:24
Nobody here knows if the price will go up or down. That's all you need to know. If they say otherwise they are lying. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:17:29
Yes. You're a few years late. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:31:34
Let me ask the third time. What or who would i be shilling for? 
Can you simply answer the question already? Or else it's safe to conclude you're just batshit paranoid. 
I hope you understand. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:16:09
How does it look like that? Serious question. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:37:59
Whatever you do, the most stupid thing you could do is asking anon people on the internet what to do with your money. Especially on a forum where everyone is invested in this item. 
So basically what you're doing now. 
Hint  nobody here can predict the price. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:14:46
Is that what you tell your friends? That it will be over 10k next year??
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:50:19
Yeah, this will work. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:07:43
Ok, so disabling access to all your money for 10 years is good advice according to you? Seriously? And that is while even ignoring that Bitcoin could simply crash and not recover. 
And what the hell has my account age to do with anything???
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:14:47
That's why he used a random 2015 date. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:55:05
He asked something, i answered him and everyone goes nuts?
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:24:20
of course it's a scam. Any mining site that promises free money is a scam. 
All these years and people still fall for it. 
Odd. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:59:06
Which means what? What are you saying? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:33:37
Holy shit. Next level of understanding? Seriously??
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:06:56
Hard to say. If that's all your savings i would say don't. But if that's extra money with which you can gamble i'd say go for it. 
I mean if you want to make decent money then 10 or 50 dollars won't get you anywhere. 
But i can't see the inside of your wallet. If you feel comfortable gambling 1k then do it. I personally can see Bitcoin going up more but nobody can guarantee it won't go back to 2000 tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:21:24
What is this prediction based on? Seems to me you're just pulling numbers out of your behind. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:35:43
My own stalker from another sub. Well, that's a first. 
You have some serious issues, you creep. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:39:00
Nobody knows when to buy. 
Just buy when you feel comfortable. It can go up, it can go down. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:58:44
Please don't listen to that shit. Use some common sense. 
Some random guy on Reddit telling you how to become a millionaire with 1000 dollars and you get all euphoric? C'mon. 
What makes you think he can predict the price like that? You believe he has some secret info what will happen in the future or something?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:44:37
Absolutely nothing Bitcoin related happened in Cyprus back then. Just a ridiculous myth. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:57:09
Haha how are we supposed to answer the first 2 questions?
3rd question: yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:35:33
The same question 10 times a day. Literally the exact same question. 
Stop asking people you don't know what to do with your money!
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:22:25
Early adopters is a meme. Bitcoin is 8 years old. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:06:39
Thanks for posting. Hopefully this time upvoted. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:05:48
Random internet guy from the states? He is right!
Random guy from Venezelua? Doesn't mean anything!!
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:35:57
My point is that this sub has seen 50 similar posts about how Bitcoin is exploding in Venezuela and saving half the population from
starving. And it's all sensationalist bs. 
Yet every time it gets upvoted to the top. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:25:20
So everything that you haven't heard of is still in early adoption phase? Is that how it works you think?
Thanks for all the downvotes. "I don't agree with you so i'm gonna downvote the fuck out of you like the adult i am!"
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:13:30
Haha how am i a troll?
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:27:28
Every single person here is watching the price. We don't need an update every time we go up 50 dollars. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:43:25
Yeah so? Let's just cherry pick things now and compare it to Bitcoin?
Shall i cherry pick some things that never went mainstream then?
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:39:24
Jfc! Yes we know! Besides the fact that everyone here is watching the price 2 others already posted the same thing before you. 
Stop "updating" this sub every 5 minutes. It's annoying as hell. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:08:47
How the hell should we know. Stop asking these dumb questions. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:29:46
Flip a coin. 
Nobody knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:00:33
20% drops like this are typical?? Haha what?
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:13:05
Really? We had no idea!!
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:11:06
How the hell should we know. Why do 20 people a day here ask us if we can see into the future? Use some common sense. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:01:46
I bought a lot of coins under 50 dollars and own a lot of money now. Indeed. Does that upset you? It sure seems that way. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:51:21
Why compare it to that?? Why not to a currency that never went mainstream? 
I won't because it will be cherry picking. Like you just did. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 08:34:59
How do ICO's get bought you think?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:54:07
I'm not disagreeing that it's just like the internet but just because it is doesn't magically make it go mainstream as well! That's my point that noone seems to understand. 
It can go mainstream, i hope it goes mainstream but just because email or internet went mainstream doesn't mean Bitcoin will. 
Reply after reply with "well, product x went mainstream so Bitcoin will as well" is just silly. 
But hey apparently i am a troll because i like to discuss things and am not 100% sure it will go mainstream. So continue the downvoting guys. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:39:41
Welcome to the great world of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:22:28
Nobody knows. You already know that. So then why ask?
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:13:21
You started crying like a little bitch how i must be a millionaire and when i respond to it i'm bragging?? God, you're retarded. 
Bye Felicia. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:14:17
You can't be serious?
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:17:39
Nobody knows. Another coin could easily take over in the future. 
But guess what? We can't see in the future so nobody can answer your question. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:12:10
How is accepting euros too risky?
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:24:58
I run a business and don't do that. Neither does anyone i know. That's just weird. 
And how exactly will Bitcoin become stable? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:01:32
I bought my first coins in 2013. Stop making a clown of yourself. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 08:37:16
Ffs stop posting this childish meme every time we go up 100 dollars. Especially if we reached this price point a week ago already. 
I truly wonder if the average age here is 16. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:57:32
Post  how mining contracts are a scam. 
Yes, the rest of the world figured that out a couple of years ago already. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:48:36
Because everything you point out is juuuuust like Bitcoin! And everything you don't point out because it never went mainstream is noooooothing like Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:18:24
I heard Dogecoin might replace Bitcoin soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:24:22
So how many coins did you buy today? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:25:40
I only use 1 account you paranoid weirdo. Why would i use more???
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:12:35
Yes. They're giving everyone 1000 dollars for free. How could this not be legit!
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:43:59
Use your brain ffs! That guy has no idea where the price will go. It could go up or down. He just doesn't want you to sell because it will make his coins worth less. 
20 times a day people ask us here to see into the future. We fucking can't!
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:06:14
Do a chargeback. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:53:31
Yes still hilarious. 
Up until a few months ago this place ALWAYS called a sudden price drop a crash without any problems but since the retarded dip meme exists suddenly one is not allowed to use the word crash anymore. And if you do you get attacked and downvoted to fuck. 
People here are batshit crazy. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:34:08
Flip a coin. It's as trustworthy as any answer here. 
And stop calling it a dip. It was a crash. Bitcoin crashed. Hard. 
That dip meme here lately is just so stupid. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:56:56
The word dip was never used here. 6 months ago everyone would call this a crash. Everyfuckingone!
Now i get downvoted to fuck for not calling it a dip. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:37:11
God, this retarded new dip meme must be one of the most stupid things this sub has come up with. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:42:27
Hilarious. We reached the point where we can't call a crash a crash anymore because it upsets people. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:27:14
Let me guess. You are totally euphoric that you just lost 1/6th of your investment and are totally buying "the dip". 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:40:06
The plot thickens. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:12:32
Well written captain moron. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:26:32
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:46:28
Well, this sub is teaching everyone to "hodl". 
Maybe then we shouldn't start crying when merchants stop accepting it. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:05:11
Merchants are not gonna lower their prices so people will pay with Bitcoin. Get out of fantasy land. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:25:22
Nobody knows. 
Every time the answer is the same. Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:25:06
So how much are you buying? 5 coins? 10? 20?
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:05:31
Brag? I responded to the guy showing him he was wrong. How is that bragging you moron?
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:50:14
Bitcoin is 8 years old. How much longer are you people gonna be totally butthurt when someone doesn't like Bitcoin like you do? Another 8 years?
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:59:09
Wtf? Move away from the keyboard and take your meds. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:30:40
Please stop. We know. We see the charts. Stop "updating" this sub every 5 minutes. Someone else already posted the exact same thing minutes ago.  
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:39:38
Salty bunch you 2 are. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:45:53
Huh? Point me out where i said such a thing??? Seriously, where?
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:44:14
I'll explain it one more time for you. Slooooowly read it till you get it. 
Until very recently it was totally normal to call a crash like this a crash. Nobody used the word dip. The word crash was used for years without problems. 
Now suddenly it's not allowed anymore because nutters like you go all crazy when someone does. Now suddenly every crash is a dip and those who still dare to call it a crash will be attacked and downvoted to oblivion. 
And that, regardless if it was a crash or not, is just completely retarded behavior. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:44:58
Haha wtf? God, that is pathetic. 
Guyz, someone implies that Bitcoin migh or might not go mainstream!!! BTC TROLLLLLLLL!!!!!
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:28:21
Well, there you go. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:11:13
So when will Dogecoin go mainstream as it's totally comparable as well?
So basically anything that is comparable to the internet will go mainstream. Good to know. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:17:20
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:44:33
Huh? Evidence?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:55:09
Because internet went mainstream Bitcoin by magic will as well?
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:40:36
Through Paypal? You will get scammed. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:46:41
Yeah, no. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:56:21
Oh ok. Well, in that case it just HAS to go mainstream!
And Dogecoin, will it go mainstream as well? Since it's a currency and all that. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:26:12
Nobody knows. These questions are completely pointless. Flip a coin and you get the same answer. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:59:13
Ooooh right. The news! 
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:18:17
The market doesn't give a crap about your research. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:12:39
Only goes up from here? How do you know?
Look at your first sentence. That also applies to you. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:36:16
8 years in is not an "early adopters phase". C'mon don't be ridiculous. 
At this point the early adoption meme has just become an excuse for "nobody wants to use it". 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:34:39
Roll a dice or type a random number on your keyboard. It will be the same as any estimates you'll get here. 
Also you somehow seem to forget this simply might never happen. You realize that is possible, right?
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:09:35
Nobody cares. No need to update us. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:28:18
Any minute now? We are 200 dollars away. You posted this 40 minutes ago. 
Calm down. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:29:27
Yes, you may have an advice. Stop posting in caps. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:48:19
Ok, i looked up the definition;


Ahhh right, completely unlike what happened yesterday, right guyz!
It was just a dip, not a crash. Let's ban the word crash. We're not allowed to use it anymore anyway. 
This place is insane. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:59:14
Please stop. 10 people already posted the same thing. A hour ago. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:41:17
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:07:04
2 minutes research would have answered your question. 
This has been answered literally 100's of times. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:10:33
You're skipping a step. So far it seems that merchants aren't interested in Bitcoin whatsoever. And i can't blame them. 
It's slow, the price could crash 25% in a day, ridiculous fees and so on. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:17:24
All scams. This has been explained 300 times already. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:50:25


Hahaha my god...
Why are bitcoiners such complete nutters?
Many of you are truly batshit paranoid crazy. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:04:42
Yeah just completely ignore the post you replied to. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:31:13
He would've already lost money if he listened to your great advice. 
But hey, as long as your coins become worth more, right!
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:23:24
I stopped flushing my turds and put the money i save on water into Dogecoin. I'll keep this sub updated. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:18:50
Are you seriously thinking anyone here answer this ridiculous question? C'mon!
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:26:31
And again you ignore it. And we both know why. 
Pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:58:33
Yeah sorry, not gonna read that. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:59:12
I asked you something. When you accuse me of something then please back it up. Where did i say such a thing??
