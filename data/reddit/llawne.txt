Misleading title. That list goes back to 1600 and most failed during WW1 and WW2. There have been thousands of FIAT currencies in the same timespan - which makes it like 99%+ success rate.

Tulips never regained their 16th century prices after 400 years.  Similar to btc - little intrinsic value. Other coins have better properties on the tech.

lol if i was starving - food and water definitely have intrinsic value :P

People do. Like buying real companies with real cashflows. Facebook recently dropped 40% but revenues went up 30%

Yes and all those objects have some instrinsic value. That's why you cant compare commodities to bitcoin.

If you have nothing relevant to add, just stop arguing. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, end of story. It's only value is what someone else will pay for it.

There was instrinsic value before they knew what the concept was called. Similar to how people did arbitrage before the concept existed.

Cant be compared. Gold has intrinsic value, it was used for jewelry, now for electronics components.  Bitcoin is just a currency.

Doubt there will be worldwide buzz and paranoia for bitcoin ever again.

:( no sense arguing with someone so far down the hole they dont see the light. Adios you win.

borderline delusion. More coins have failed the past year than FIAT currencies the past 100 years.

Warren Buffett wants to make one thing clear: Unlike buying stocks, bonds or real estate, buying bitcoin is not an investment.
That's because it lacks intrinsic value, Buffett says.
"If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don't have anything that is producing anything," 
This is from a verbatim interview of him explaining how bitcoin has no instrinsic value and is not an investment.
