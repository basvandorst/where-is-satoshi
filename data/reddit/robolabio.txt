Gonna be honest, it'd be nice if the "currency of the future" could defend against moronic moves like this.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:53:33
Unrelated but kids are also learning they can just watch an ad or pay money to skip hard levels. We're fucking up our kids.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:26:15
Man this is the kind of shit that won't let Bitcoin go truly mainstream. It's simply too difficult for normal people to do without losing their life savings. This has to be fixed.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:00:17
Wait... What was that bit about income tax? Was he just being irrational in a panic? How could he owe more in taxes then the donations are worth?
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:52:35
Coinbase still hasn't even responded to any of my emails or tickets. It's incredible. Fuck Coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:51:50
Damn Bitcoin sure is the future with all these life ruining flaws and bugs. In the end I feel like a big company will be the one to make Bitcoin safe and easy and then suddenly its not decentralized anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:56:20
Well that makes two of them!
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:46:11
This is literally just a fake fucking html page
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:15:44
Well then, may the best technology win. But who's technology will win? "Nobody/everybody"? Or a company?
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:46:11
Oh yeah? Well I'm 12!
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:31:17
Yes. It took me 3 weeks to even get set up. And I was extremely persistent. I can only imagine how many people would have joined and bought but gave up because it was fucking impossible.
Blame exchanges. They kinda fucking suck. *Especially* Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:42:27
Word... Fuck this coworker. I'd understand going to Facebook and writing a silly status, but logging on to your Gemini account? Coworker is either really fucking dumb or wanted to be malicious.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:07:10
Hodl it. It might go up!
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:01:29
I think it's great and all, but most people don't care at all about the fedora-tipping "save the world" stuff. They just want to get rich.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:13:13
Wait how the fuck do you only pay 16k in fiat taxes? I pay 30-40k in taxes and make less than your example.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:15:35
If we were to theorize, the correct guess is that bitcoin will go up 2-3 weeks after Christmas. Why? Families all get together, learn about Bitcoin from nerd nephew, they make accounts and take forever to verify, then they buy.
But theorizing is silly. Just HODL
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:04:16
Are you rich now OP? Send me bitcoin if yes. If no, send me bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:14:13
Well I feel the same way about all the other shitcoins out there. One or more of them will blow up fucking big but why am I not investing in them? Because it's shady and/or risky and/or inaccessible to me. Just like Bitcoin appeared to be 5 years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:10:15
Hmm. I guess so. It's still an awkward sentence.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:52:46
That "do" is unnecessary. Bad grammar!
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:52:56
Hint: it's me! Invest in me!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:34:31
Err, no. Usually when I have a problem in life, I do the best I can to fix it. With Bitcoin, I can't even get a hold of customer support. Hours of attempts have not worked. Seriously, I've tried everything. I don't really want to use a lesser known service.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:39:37
Well, I downvoted this "Meme God" trash content
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:31
Well I would like to buy in but I can't get verified on Coinbase nor Gemini. I've never felt so helpless in my life.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:16:57
If you figure this out, let me know. I'll do the same for you
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:34:08
This is why our tax situation is retarded. When it starts altering our behavior for no fucking reason and requires possibly spending even more money to make sure you do it correctly... Awful.
Should be money gained/lost and you pay a percentage. Done.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:53:53
Really? I thought it was just that I needed an ID attached to it. I guess I'll look it up
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:02:45
Wait... How will you buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:36:40
Alright... I've heard nothing but bad things about Bitstream though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:22:14
I mean, I'll try again. I think I've spent a total of 3 hours simply just taking photos and filling out verification forms.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:10:52
Good luck! I've been waiting to get verified for 2 weeks now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:05:53
So you didn't care about losing a million dollars because you're already rich? Okay
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:15:32
Dude. It's all of these fucking sites. Coinbase, Gemini, none of them verify my ID. And Customer Support is non existent.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:11:57
And my axe!
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:15:14
Deep? It's factual. You know that actually happened, right? Shits fucked
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:24:46
Yes account setup and email verified. My ID won't verify. I'm in New York.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:11:51
I think we agree, I perceived the film the same way you did, haha
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:55
I've heard of Kraken. Idk how I feel about "Coinmama"
@_date: 2019-03-11 11:18:17
Pretty sure she won't want any of his losses
@_date: 2019-03-22 15:36:18
lmfao soon we'll be selling bars of metal that represent bitcoin amounts
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:59:27
Why don't people ever fold their fake "i got this in the mail" letters?
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:18:32
You're not allowed to send a transaction without a comment, which is annoying.
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:11:56
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:52:52
When you say "well-made", do you mean like, not a scam?
@_date: 2018-11-12 00:04:34
Does it really?
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:34:23
I mean, if they are the gatekeeper to the technology, it kind of renders the actual technology they utilize to be irrelevant/moot. So in a way, they do want to make rules, so they are.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:26:36
[Bitcoin price will go up because of this graph I made](
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:14:24
Wow anyone can get verified nowadays huh, even people impersonating the President of the United States. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:15:31
You shouldn't be allowed to change your name after being verified.....
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:05:30
Even the display name should invalidate the verification.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:36:36
Or he's exploiting the weakness of an immature technology to both his fullest capability and legal right. This is what we get for "trusting" the entirety of Earth. Are we stupid?
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:33:55
A lot of crypto is based on trust. We trust that over 50% of miners are legit
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:05:34
I trust less than half the population of the world to be responsible with their bitcoin. There's too much that can go wrong. Lose your passphrase, or someone sees it, send bitcoin to wrong address, etc. And this has happened to arguably smart people.
@_date: 2018-12-30 02:57:50
Why the fuck does Roger Ver have 1.25 million dollars to spend
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:31:39
Don't downvote and hide this ugly truth. This is a downside. Not everyone reads this subreddit and people *will* get burned.
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:41:45
Must have a headache from genius brain being too big for skull
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:30:03
All these comments sound like great reasons to not use Bitcoin
