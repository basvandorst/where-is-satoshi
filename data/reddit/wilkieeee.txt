“Okay so this is funny, two hilarious edits have been made to the interview with Craig Wright.  One - deleting the reference to the $2 billion tax liability, and two - an editors note saying that "Florida eliminated its estate tax after 2005".  Also, they note that even if the estate duty did apply, the bitcoins would fall under the minimum value for estate duty as valuation is made at the time of death. “. 
Lol Craig is setting the record for the deepest hole ever dug
