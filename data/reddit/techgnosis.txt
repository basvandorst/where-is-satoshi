This. Look for the transaction in block explorer. Then you at least know where the money is.

From what I can tell, this article has nothing to do with TOR and everything to do with the mail system as the method of evidence gathering.

Lots of people are dumb and we have laws to prevent people from taking advantage of them because we aren't savages and we all benefit when we respect each other. Same goes for loans and credit and all kinds of things where missing a small detail amounts to fraud.

I know you're just playing devils advocate but this is obviously a scam. It's abuse against dumb people and there are consumer protection laws everywhere to prevent people from being taken advantage of by shit like this. It does not need to be defended and yes they should be banned for pulling stunts like this.

How many things do you think about in a day? Let's start a list shall we?
Money, your kids, your spouse, your health, your mother, what will I eat today?, why is my friend being so mean?, that thing on your back, your boss, your vacation, that one dude who you miss a lot, your grandfather's coma, your bills, that painting you just made, etc etc. 
Why do you want to add so much burden to peoples lives? Why do you want people to have to fend for themselves other absolutely everything? What if there were no laws about food safety? Got eColi? Oops! You should have done your research! Oh that guy is insider trading? Too bad! You should have seen it coming.
People can't have every single aspect of society be a burden of consumer information and to force that on them is inhumane. Let people work together to protect each other instead of running each other ragged in endless competition.

He's totally right. If you live in the US and you can't afford the tip then you can't afford the restaurant.
