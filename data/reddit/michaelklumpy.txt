@_date: 2014-12-22 11:35:48
the block rewards should depend on the transactions in the block  
of course not strongly, but something like:  
if more than average per block : 25.1 BTC  
if less than average : 24.9 BTC  
if average: 25 BTC
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:49:59
this requires transactions to be 'expensive', tho  
my solution can fix both problems (as long as there still are block rewards)
@_date: 2014-09-02 06:45:40

there already was a mempool before we reached the 1mb ceiling. Miners risk longer block propagation when creating really large blocks, so transactions with very small fees won't be worth the risk.
@_date: 2016-01-08 16:04:30
have you sold everything to buy bitcoin and only kept the cash and stuff you need until mid 2016? Why not?

@_date: 2015-01-15 06:49:52
you  should crosspost to @_date: 2015-01-03 18:14:57
compared to market cap they are
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:03:58
I mean there's always been transactions within the mempool even after a &lt; 1mb block was found. So miners haven't filled blocks before, even if they could have
@_date: 2015-01-29 09:46:12
BUT: fake commiting back in history is a really bad move  
especially since every fork which doesn't have the change will still be valid

@_date: 2015-05-15 09:07:39

@_date: 2016-03-12 22:47:59
flat amount each block that MIGHT be reduced, but never increased. So the inflation rate converges to 0, tho.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:50:48
but what IF, bro. Or if the altcoin isn't code and actually a duck with a unicycle?
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:09:58
question is whether having a huge blockchain or blocked transaction is worse
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:34:26
10 BTC = life savings?
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:39:29
if there was only space for one transaction, he'd only have to pay the highest fee. If there's space for 10 transactions, he has to pay 10 fees of which each has to be higher than the fee of the legit transaction.  
It becomes more and more expensive for a spammer to block all transactions, the more are allowed
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:38:32
it's not an actual double spending attack  
satoshi-dice removed all anti-double-spending-protection intentionally  
We're in the "bitcoin was never hacked" thread. And claiming there were double spending attacks with these examples is just wrong imo
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:13:47
I guess there's a difference between posting about it and having 50% of all posts being about it
@_date: 2016-03-15 20:39:44
Do you think the spammers are trying to fill your hard drive or to prevent you from sending transactions cheaply and freely?  
If it's the latter, then raising the limit would actually make it more difficult for them.  
If it's a "make the blockchain big" attack, then sure, 1mb makes it harder for them. But imo that's not their goal and also not as bad as the other outcome.
@_date: 2016-03-12 21:29:33

@_date: 2016-01-23 15:10:49
you do realize that it changes constantly, right?
@_date: 2016-03-27 20:34:58
if everyone just HOLDS and the block reward shrinks, you'll have no hashing power protecting the network
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:53:17
Most of these can be prevented by not allowing any free transactions, or only a tiny fraction of free transactions, while raising the limit.
Currently there's transactions for more than the next 45 blocks in the mempool,
but only ~6BTC in fees.  
blocking / hindering the entire network for ~7.5 hours for less than 6BTC doesn't look that expensive to me.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:07:13
One block is secured by the cost of mining said block. And since mining cost will be very close to the block reward, a block is basically as secure as the worth of its reward.  
So how is constantly lowering the reward / block not threatening the security?  
Or threating the usability, by further and further increasing fees?  
Also, how is the possible outcome of less than 6k nodes a huge centralisation deal, while having pools with over 25% is totally fine?  
Edit:  
Considering the orphan rate / bandwith debate : Why is it fine to require from every miner to have the best mining hardware to be profitable, but once mining requires a non-shitty internet connection it's centralisation?  Why not require good hardware and a decent connection?  Also what stops miners from creating small blocks no matter what the limit is?
@_date: 2016-01-09 13:02:01
I'm on your side -.-

don't get me wrong, I kinda agree on the opportunity to buy cheap coins. But having the value go up 100$ would be way better.

@_date: 2016-01-12 20:53:30
I introduced friends to BTC 1 or 2 days before the stresstest. Don't tell me having transactions stuck forever won't drive people off.  
Especially once the value drops again and people can't get their BTC onto exchanges to sell.

UASF was never considered an alt here, even if it looked like it would fork. Also im pretty sure Bitcoin within its name would have been fine  
Edit:  
Also remember how BU and Classic were forbidden since they were alts and would have forked. Then UASF came along and was totally fine. Now Cash forked and it's bad again.  
Just keep bending your views / rules. It's pathetic
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:28:09

@_date: 2017-01-27 13:39:39
for that you have to set the block size limit to 0 and delete the currently existing blockchain entirely

If you don't allow others to fork and implement what they think is better, anyone owning the github repo owns Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Cash is worse, it'll just die off. If it's better, you'll have a better version of Bitcoin.
