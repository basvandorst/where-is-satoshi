Really? Security concerns with Ledger and Trezor? Seems those are among the most secure ways to store crypto.

Or if Bitcoin does get a 1 Trillion Dollar market cap, would make Satoshi the most powerful person on the planet, financially speaking.

Whoa now. I simply saw this and took a pic. But if I run into the person who left it, I will be sure to let them know how you feel.

Actually a very relevant article.

I always wonder if the person tasked with pulling the public and private keys for these coins, keeps a spreadsheet of them all, and one day can just empty them.

I only use the Ledger Nano S. It is my favorite cold storage solution. So easy to use.

I'm 50/50 when it comes to savings. I take 50% of the money every check that I would put in savings and stick it into Bitcoin, it goes right on a hardwallet and I forget about it. I only do 50% because in the grand scheme of things this tech is still new. We have no idea if there is a "burn it to the ground" button somewhere when it comes to Bitcoin, and as much as I would love to see this become the money of planet Earth, god forbid the shit hits the fan I do not want to be homeless.
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:42:10
May I ask if you had any gut feeling something shady was up when sending that much money across the planet to someone you never met?
Nothing can be done, it's gone. You must go into everything surrounding crypto with the mindset that everyone is trying to screw you. If you think like that, you will play things a little more safe hopefully. 
Don't even bother reporting it, it's done. Move on if you can. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:15:23
Sorry friendo. That Bitcoin is gone.

Thanks for all the advice. Next part of this is: I am sure Coinbase and the IRS communicate, but what about Binance and those other exchanges. Are they sending the IRS reports of my trades in these altcoins? Who is regulating this? Will the IRS just ask me for my Binance history?
Crypto and taxes are kinda confusing. Who's to say I didn't sell my coins for way under market rate at some point. The IRS have access to my Ledger balance?

Of course it wasn't the spotlight, it was about the new phone and features, half the world uses these phones and most of them have no idea what crypto is or why this is relevant. No sense in walking everyone through storing their crypto when they have no idea what that is. 
That being said, this is very cool and a major plus for the crypto world.

It really depends how much you have total. I keep the bulk of my stash in cold storage (Ledger) I keep a nice chunk on the exchanges so I can move it around, gift it, play with it, trade it... 
You need to look at your own books and decide if it is worth cold storage, but if it is a significant amount, than FOR SURE take it off the exchanges.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:53:59
Thanks everyone. The LeMetric one looks the most appealing currently. 
I'm surprised nobody has made a fun easy to use ticker for crypto yet. So few options. Oh well.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:00:23
Do not listen to the naysayers. Coinbase is still probably the safest easiest place for newbies to buy Bitcoin safely. I still use it from time to time. 
Bitcoin is most likely going to go way up, this is speculative, but from what we have seen it is way undervalued currently. Buying it at under $6,000 is considered by many as getting it on "sale."
If you have some money to spend, why not invest in this space. Crypto is the future, Bitcoin is the big player. A small investment now could be major for you down the road. Don't get mixed up in daytrading crypto, just buy what you want to hodl. 
Good luck!

If you read between the lines of this article it says "You can not stop Bitcoin, this monster is coming one way or another, buy now while you can"

No need to gloat to this community. Also, get in a habit of not telling people how much crypto you own. It's like telling people how much money you make at work, inappropriate.

Hmmm. Let's see here. My friend Bob bought a Bitcoin this past Dec 15th for $3,200. Here we are 4 months later, it's at $5,600. Almost double. 
Now, it could go either way. But let that sink in real quick.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:53:42
Not how that works.

I'm with ya, but 50% of the community think it's going to $4,200 and 50% think it's going to $6,200. Charts say this, charts say that. It's hard to get a read. 
I hope it goes up because I love moon, I hope it goes down so I can grab a little more on sale. Win win.

This thread is the exact reason so many people can't get behind crypto. It's scary if you don't know a ton about storage and are trying to set up a Ledger or something like that on your own.
Once we break the barrier of a simple easy storage solution that grandma can store crypto on, than we can take this thing to a whole new level.
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:22:18
The point of this was to plant the seed in peoples minds about crypto and possibly get them interested or excited. This was not about giving financial advice or being one of those pushy Bitcoin people. In fact, nobody even knew that I was into this before hand. 
Almost all the recipients have expressed a newfound interest in Bitcoin. It's almost like I gave them something they thought was unattainable. Now that I have explained to them that they all are directly connected to the blockchain, most can't help but want more knowledge. 
Which was the whole point to begin with.

I live in NYC have good friends that work at JP Morgan, Goldman etc.. You are not allowed to say "Bitcoin" in the office there. That being said, a lot of those same friends are hodling BTC. I know for a fact. (set up a couple Ledgers with 2 of them)
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:03:42
So the stock market puzzles you as well huh?
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:22:25
This is actually great news, even though I'm not a fan of Robinhood. I say this because I live in NYC and have a lot of friends that use it. It means more eyes on crypto and more people buying BTC which I think is important. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 20:10:28
That thing looks pretty cool though.

Go on Coinbase and buy some bitcoin. Stop worrying so much. Don't follow stupid links, just go to coinbase and buy before you miss out on great pricing.

@_date: 2018-12-14 15:54:32
but why?
@_date: 2019-05-08 20:13:56
12 words is fine, nobody is going to guess that easily. Also, if you are storing less sats than the cost of a cold wallet, I wouldn't stress.
