Ok so they’re not directly traceable all the way back, but they have essentially the same end result as if they were then I guess, just using a different method to get to that end result, of being able to keep everyone’s wallet balances at the correct numbers based on transactions.
@_date: 2019-11-01 00:06:04
Do you mind clarifying at which specific place the block data is scrambled with the hash function, and the hash gets outputted?
Is the mining software doing both those things? Or is the bitcoin software doing the scrambling on the mempool?
Edit: Wait I think you sorta answered that in your  slowly getting a handle on all this lol
@_date: 2019-11-01 04:04:39
Alright final try lol, I think the proof-of work thing just finally clicked too, and why and how that keeps everything honest.
Ultra-condensed version:
Scenario Bob wants to send Steve 1 bitcoin.
1. Bob puts in request for the transfer.
2. Bob's identity is verified.
3. The transaction request is verified by checking it against the master timeline list of everyone's transactions, which in turn keeps an up-to-date tally of everyone's account balance as well.     **It's basically impossible for invalid transactions to be added to the master list, since it's not feasible to re-do the work required to add a new "block" of data to the end of the master list that everyone uses. It would create a fork in the list that would be quickly rejected, since it's again not feasible to show the "proof-of-work" required to validate that fork.
4. Once verified, the transaction is added to the master list, and the 1 bitcoin shows up in Steve's account.

Appreciate it, it finally all clicked just recently.
I wasn’t understanding originally that the coin being “spent” is destroyed, and a new one of equal value created in its place that shows up in the recipient’s wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:13:37
While it might not be *technically* accurate, it does help people (me included as of very recently!) understand how it all works in more simple terms.
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:55:45
Got it, got it. It's all clicking again, thanks so much for your help!
@_date: 2019-11-01 04:15:01
It's funny, all of this was with the idea of just learning how it all works, with no intention of going crazy with using it lol (though I have before, but never more than with $100 or something).
It's so crazy to me that basically all bitcoin is, is digital banking with a REALLY good security mechanism (proof-of-work). And it's layered with even more protection by being decentralized on everyone's computer running the software, and constantly verifying everything.
Edit: Ah, and now I understand the trust part of it super clearly. Cause it's much easier to trust consensus of millions of fellow citizens than a bank/corporation. Feel like lightbulbs are popping in my head now lol
I honestly HOPE that the Satoshi dude is more than one person, cause if it is just one person, they're crazy smart!
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:03:02
Ah okay so basically since miners are getting rewarded by newly created bitcoin *on top* of the newly created bitcoin to satisfy the transactions in a block, new bitcoin are being created kind of at a higher rate than they normally would be, to ensure the miners are incentivized to keep the system running?
Edit: Or wait, no, the miner’s reward is the only NEW bitcoin coming into the system I think, since transactions are only deleting and creating the same amount of bitcoin, is that right?
@_date: 2019-11-01 20:58:56


When I'm saying that, I'm saying that *from* the blockchain, each user's current "bitcoin account balance" could be theoretically calculated, since the blockchain/ledger has a list of all transactions.


And when I'm saying that, I'm meaning all the blocks combined, since each block of the bitcoin blockchain essentially makes up a long single list of transactions. (Since the header data of one block is included in the data on the new block, connecting them all together and all that).
But overall yeah, I wasn't originally aware that bitcoins were destroyed each time they were spent, and a new one created in its place, so that was confusing my understanding of everything.
@_date: 2019-11-01 04:10:37
Phew, got it lol
Appreciate you guys dealing with my ignorance for 2 days!
@_date: 2019-11-01 03:45:35
I think I actually did watch that video back when I originally posted the original post lol.
I probably need to re-watch it though to grasp it all.
I will say that I think it was that one that made all the "why" of the bitcoin, and why blockchain is so potentially influential a lot more clear for me though. Just the actual how it works part I keep getting hung up on obviously!
I had a chance to jump on bitcoin pretty soon after it came out, but disregarded it as complicated nonsense, obviously a big mistake!
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:05:36
Ah, interesting, didn't even know about "light wallets", thanks for the info!
@_date: 2019-11-01 03:30:12
Wait I think it finally clicked.
So since new blocks being hashed are checking against the ENTIRE master bitcoin blockchain (so to speak), they are essentially checking against a master tally of how many bitcoins each person has, so it can also trace the trail of bitcoins, which re-verifies how many bitcoins each person should have.
So the whole system is constantly verifying everyone's account balances so to speak.
I don't think it's that simple because of the bitcoin creation process, and how wallets work and all that, so I still probably need to read more about how that all works.
But as far as a basic concept, am I on the right track now?
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:15:19
Thank you guys so much for finally helping me understand how bitcoin works! Enjoy the Reddit "coins" lol!
@_date: 2019-11-01 23:40:58
When you get a chance could you let me know if all the steps below are finally in the right order?:
I do have one question too: For step  I'm a little confused on the process insofar as the new bitcoin being created to be transferred, and the new bitcoin created that is rewarded to the miner. **Is the bitcoin reward the miners receive created on top of all of the bitcoin that needs to be created to satisfy the transactions inside of a block?** So basically, are they *themselves* having to do the work of creating that reward bitcoin, or is it simply rewarded to them by the software, without any work needing to be done on the miner's part? And where does the bitcoin that needs to be created for the transactions inside the block come into play with all of this?
1. Sender wants to send bitcoin to recipient.
2. Transaction request created.
3. Sender signature attached to request.
4. Signed transaction request broadcasted.
5. Sender identity verified.
6. Transaction request validated.
7. Transaction request placed in mempool.
8. Transaction request + group of others from mempool selected.
9. Miner bundles selected requests into potential block.
10. Hash function attached to potential block.
11. Miners compete to find hash.
12. Hash is found.
13. Sender bitcoin deleted.
14. New equal value bitcoin created.
15. Miner who found hash first given free, newly created bitcoin reward (separately created along with bitcoin going to recipient?) + transaction fees.
16. Hash verified.
17. Block legitimized (no longer just a "potential" block).
18. Block added to blockchain.
19. New bitcoin (minus transaction fee) given to recipient.
Thanks again so much for your help! Just wanting to make absolutely sure I have the exact timeline of when each step of the process is happening.
I'm now wanting to write my own blog post with the steps of the process clearly outlined in plain english, because it was super frustrating getting so much conflicting information across other blogs and youtube videos, many of which left out steps, or key pieces of information (such as bitcoin being destroyed, and new bitcoin being created when it's "transferred" - that piece of information NO one just clearly stated, and confused the hell out of me. It's one of those things that isn't obvious until you understand it!)
@_date: 2019-11-01 21:12:48
Gotcha, appreciate all of this, helps clear up a few lingering questions I had.
I kept thinking the blocks were all sequential by clocktime, but of course that makes no sense, they are sequential insofar as the order they were added to the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-11-01 02:16:22
Ok I have a question.
So If I'm understanding correctly:
Once a miner creates a block of transactions, a hash function + hash output is automatically created for that specific block by the mining software, right?
And then that SAME mining software tries to guess the hash, and the block is valid?
So if those things above are true... how does one mining program both create and "solve" a function of its own creation? That seems like essentially nothing is happening, and this whole mining process is useless lol. But I'm sure I'm probably just understanding wrong again!
**Edit: Okay my main new question lol:**
What are the "checks" that the hash function is doing when verifying all the transactions on a new block that's created? I'm pretty sure it does the following, but what else?: Re-verifing ALL previous blocks, timestamps, making sure there's no fraudulent transactions inside the block, making sure the bitcoins trying to be transferred weren't previously spent.... and then what else, or are all those accurate? Are these just a bunch of things built into the bitcoin software to automate the process of verifying a transaction? So this would be like banking software that makes sure someone actually has the money in their account, and all that or something?
@_date: 2019-11-01 03:37:05
Gotcha ok.
Yeah I think the whole block system is just tripping it up and making it harder for me.
It's much easier for me to think of it all as one master google sheets file that no one can edit, but everyone can view or something like that.
But it's hard to comprehend the bitcoin process in terms of one master sheet.
@_date: 2019-10-31 17:13:44
Oof, every new comment you guys post makes me more confused and question my whole understanding of bitcoin and blockchain lol
I do appreciate the knowledge though!
I’ll watch the video you linked and hopefully that will help me iron out the things wrong in my list.
You did see my edited version of the list right? Hopefully it’s a little more correct than the 1st attempt.
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:34:42
Ok guys, I *think* I finally have it all figured out now.. maybe!
I do have 2 questions though:
**Question 1: Does the bitcoin software create the block and then pass that block to mining software, or does the mining software create the block?**
**Question 2: If you're only able to currently "spend" unused coins, once all coins have been mined, won't that "rule" be broken, and everyone will just recirculate all coins from that point on?**
**Block** - A virtual list.
**Chain** - Some piece of information linking one block to the next.
**Blockchain** - A linked, sequential group of virtual blocks.
**Bitcoin** - A decentralized, virtual currency.
**Bitcoin block** - A list of a few thousand transactions. A block has a limit of 1MB, in order to make sure everything runs quickly and efficiently.
**Bitcoin blockchain** - A linked, sequential group of bitcoin blocks, all forming one big "master" list of ALL bitcoin transactions.
**Bitcoin software** - A virtual software that holds copies of the bitcoin blockchain. Every computer in the world running this software all have the same copy of this "master" list, and it updates approximately every 10 minutes. You can think of this software as the bitcoin "bank", but every computer running the software is essentially running a copy of the bank, so it's not a single bank controlling everything, but a connected, decentralized group of the same bank all over the world.
**Bitcoin mining software** - A virtual software that verifies that bitcoin blocks are valid.
**Miner** - Person, or group of people, who run the bitcoin mining software on either a computer or dedicated hardware. Bitcoin "miners" are incentivized to "mine" by getting rewarded with bitcoin of their own plus transaction fees. There is actually a limit to how much bitcoin can be "mined" (21 million bitcoin), and once that is reached, "miners" will be incentivized solely by making money from transaction fees.
**Mining** - Solving hash functions, also called doing "work".
**Hash function** - A complex math formula that scrambles data in a bitcoin block.
**Hash** - The solution to a hash function. This is also the "piece of information" that links, or "chains" bitcoin blocks together to form the bitcoin blockchain, as the hash of the previous bitcoin block is embedded in the data on the next bitcoin block, and the process repeats.
**Scenario: Bob wants to send 1 bitcoin to Steve.**
*NOTE: When I say "username" I mean public key, when I say "password" I mean private key.*
1. Bob logs into his bitcoin account, and creates a transaction request including his username, Steve's username, and the 1 bitcoin to be transferred, and then presses "Send".
2. The transaction request is "signed" with Bob's password, which is hidden inside the request via a complex math formula.
3. The signed transaction request is sent to all computers in the world running the bitcoin software.
4. The bitcoin software running on all these computers all verify that the signed transaction request is actually from Bob by essentially matching Bob's username to his signature (since, again, the signature has his password embedded inside it, and his username and password are also linked via a complex math formula).
5. Once the bitcoin software running on all the computers all verify the transaction request is really from Bob, they all add the request to a list of transactions, called a "block", along with a few thousand other transactions waiting to be verified.
6. Next, the bitcoin software scrambles the data in the "block" with a complex math formula called a "hash function", and outputs a sequence of symbols called a "hash", which act like an ID for the "block".
7. From here, the bitcoin software running on all computers sends the scrambled "block" to all computers (or standalone hardware) running bitcoin mining software.
8. Next, the "block" waits to be verified, or "mined", by one person, or many people running the bitcoin mining software. These people are called "miners", and they usually will pick a "block" to verify based on how many bitcoins it could potentially make them, since they are rewarded with free bitcoin if their mining software verifies the "block" before other people's mining software.
9. Once the "block" is picked to be verified by a person, or group of people, the bitcoin mining software tries to guess the "hash", or ID of the "block", which verifies all of the transactions inside the "block" are valid.
10. Whoever's bitcoin mining software guesses the "hash" first then sends the "block" back out to all the computers running the bitcoin software for a final, mass verification that the "block" is actually valid.
11. After final verification that the "block" is valid, the bitcoin software running on all the computers all add the "block" to the bitcoin "blockchain", which is a connected master list of all verified bitcoin transactions.
12. Once Bob's transaction request is in the "blockchain", it is considered a completed transaction, and the 1 bitcoin is added to Steve's bitcoin account.
@_date: 2019-10-31 00:53:18
Okay I just spent like two hours researching, watching YouTube videos, and writing this up lol, if you don't mind can you let me know if this is all sounds correct? I tried to make it as simple English as possible for my own sake to be able to comprehend it all better. Thank you!
Bitcoin = A list of transactions.
Bitcoin (longer) = A decentralized list of transactions that every computer running bitcoin "mining" software has a copy of, that is automatically updated every 10 minutes.
Scenario: Bob wants to send 1 bitcoin from his bank account to Steve's bank account.
1. Bob broadcasts a message with a transaction request on the internet that all computers running bitcoin "mining" software receive a copy of that includes Bob's username, Steve's username, and the amount to be transferred (1 bitcoin). A signature gets automatically attached to this message, which hides the message + Bob's password inside it via a complex math problem.
2. Next, all the "mining" computers verify that this message is actually from Bob and not from somebody else by solving a different complex math problem that verifies that the signature is correct by essentially matching Bob's username to his password (which are also linked via an entirely different complex math problem).
3. After the message is verified, Bob's transaction request gets placed into a "pool" of other pending transactions that are waiting to be added to the master bitcoin list of transactions (in reality this list is separated into smaller lists, or "blocks", because of size constraints).
4. When Bob's transaction is picked by a "miner" (this is just a luck of the draw, sometimes your transaction is picked before others in the waiting "pool", other times it's picked later), the "miner" solves yet another complex math problem that finally adds the transaction to the master bitcoin list of transactions.
5. Once Bob's transaction is added to the master bitcoin list, the transaction is considered "processed" and the 1 bitcoin is added to Steve's bank account.
@_date: 2019-10-31 02:31:27
Sorry, I should have specified, when I'm saying "bank account", I'm meaning a bitcoin wallet. Just was trying to use as basic of terminology I'm familiar with as possible.
I've modified the list (hopefully accurately!) with your info - thanks a bunch for all you've written out by the way!
Bitcoin = A virtual currency.
Blockchain = A virtual list.
The bitcoin blockchain = A decentralized virtual list of bitcoin transactions that every computer running bitcoin software has a copy of, that is automatically updated around every 10 minutes (can vary).
Scenario: Bob wants to send 1 bitcoin from his bank account to Steve's bank account.
1. Bob creates a transaction request that includes his username, Steve's username, and the amount to be transferred (1 bitcoin). A signature gets automatically created and attached to this transaction request, which hides the message + Bob's password inside it via a complex math problem.
2. Bob sends a copy of this transaction request with the signature to all computers running bitcoin software.
3. All the computers running bitcoin software verify that the transaction request is actually from Bob and not from somebody else by solving a different complex math problem that verifies that the signature is correct by essentially matching Bob's username to his password (which are also linked via an entirely different complex math problem).
4. After Bob's transaction request is verified, it gets placed into a "pool" of other pending transactions that are waiting to be added to (or "mined" into) a "block" (the overall master bitcoin list of transactions is broken up into these "blocks" - it's done this way because of size and computing power restraints). Transactions are added to a "block" by a "miner", or group of "miners" running bitcoin mining software. Bitcoin "miners" are incentivized to "mine" by getting rewarded with bitcoin of their own plus transaction fees.  There is actually a limit to how much bitcoin can be "mined", and once that is reached, "miners" will be incentivized solely by making money from transaction fees.
5. So, when Bob's transaction request is picked by a "miner" (since "miners" are people, they usually will pick transactions that will make them the most money to "mine", so it might take longer for your request to get picked if it's a smaller amount), the "miner" solves yet another complex math problem that finally adds the transaction to the master bitcoin list of transactions.
6. Once Bob's transaction is added to the master bitcoin list, the transaction is considered "processed", and the 1 bitcoin is added to Steve's bank account.
@_date: 2019-10-30 22:32:04


So are you saying that every single requested bitcoin transaction requires mining to take place specifically to complete that transaction?
So aka, if all computers in the world decided to stop mining for 1 day, no bitcoin transactions could take place on that day?
Or is there a decentralized "bank" of bitcoin that just exists with all the mined bitcoin, that transactions pull from?
