I'm sure you spent a lot of time on that, but it would only really make sense to people who already know what the blockchain is.   I don't think it really *explained* anything.  And the stuff at the end about entombing satoshi... thats.. well... weird.

Alright, I'll accept that.
To make it worse, I never did manage to use them to buy something, and I ended up sending them to MtGox... about 2 weeks before that all fell over.  Guess that was probably my fault too :)

Ahh I see.  I'd never seen the Inputs button and realised I probably didn't have a setting turned on, and spotted the Coin Control Features setting.
I have accumulated about 0.1btc of very small amounts, and every time I go to send any of them, I get hit with a large transaction fee.
I shall play with this.  Thankyou for pointing out something I should have noticed sooner.

Wow, you're lucky you got your money out in time.  I only had 0.05 btc in mtgox when it flopped, so I didn't have anything in there I couldn't afford to lose.  At least I didn't have my life savings in there like some people did.

ASIC = Application Specific Integrated Circuit.
It is a chip that is designed for a specific purpose, as opposed to the chip inside your computer which is more generic.  The computer chip can do a much wider range of things, but is slower.  The ASIC does a very small set of things (often just one thing) and can therefore be optimised to be much faster.
Your computer also contains hundreds of ASIC chips for various tasks.
ASIC's work especially well when you expect to get one output for one input.   You feed it data, and it outputs data.  They are less effective when they have to process large amounts of disperate data to generate an output.

I work for a bank, one of the largest in Australia.  Would you feel comfortable if a large bank ran a bitcoin exchange?   I'm considering bringing it up with my Executive Manager.   Not really expecting it to go anywhere.
If a major bank ran a bitcoin exchange, would you use it?
EDIT:  The responses here are overwhelmingly positive so far.   I'm short for time today, but maybe tomorrow I will ask the rest of their thoughts.  I am fairly low on the totem-pole of decision making, so I can't promise anything, and may need your input on how best to convince management that it would be a good idea.  On a side note, I am in IT, and not an actual banker.
Cheers, guys, and have a good night.

goto is an excellent method of error handling.
Avoiding goto, can end up with convoluted code that hides bugs.   Sometimes Goto is not necessary, but other times, avoiding goto because of it's stigma is just silly.
Also, using exceptions with try/catch, is really just another way of doing a goto.

What exactly do you mean by _regulation?_  how could regulation possibly stop any kind of theft like this?   Or do you mean some government or institution should cover it like insurance if a theft occurs?

I'm not a fan of PHP at all, but was curious, what language would you prefer an exchange (or any site really) the size of mtgox to be in?
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:35:16
What we really need to look at, are the people and institutions just below the event horizon of those who already have the existing monetary system tied up.   Those people are hungry for opportunity to break into that bubble, and it seems that they are very interested in bitcoin.  They have very little to lose, and a lot to gain, if it upsets the entrenched elite.

A drunk walks into a bar, orders a drink and says to the bartender, "all lawyers are assholes" and the guy at the end of the bar says "you better take that back" The drunk man goes, "why, are you a lawyer?" The man says "no, I'm an asshole."

It would be awesome if there was a chart which showed the typical amount of bandwidth needed for a full node, and also just to keep a bitcoin wallet up to date.

That is a bit disheartening.  I guess it doesn't hurt to reveal that I do work for CBA (commsec, actually).
I hadn't heard about the coinjar accounts being closed, and now I'm rather bummed out. 
My previous impression was they were rather neutral, but maybe not.

That is not correct.  The protocol is fine.   To properly identify a transaction, clients are supposed to decode it, and get the transaction details from inside it.  Mtgox were doing something that they had been told not to do for a long time.   They were using a hash of the transaction that is not meant to be used to identify it.
The protocol is fine.   Everyone that used the protocol how it was meant to be used is fine.
Mtgox fucked up.  Other exchanges fucked up.

Run your own mining node, then you can include whatever transactions you want into the block you find, and you can reap in the $10 or so worth of fees from other transactions.  Of course, you would probably need $40,000 worth of equipment to mine that block.

When I first heard of bitcoin, I think it was selling for about $6, and I didnt really understand it, and there was some noise about people calling it a bubble at that, and the price was likely to crash.   I didn't buy any.
Quite some time later, when I became interested in it again, I think the price was around $100.   In discussing it with my wife, we had about $5000 available and I was going to buy some bitcoin.   But family stuff happened and I was unable to get to the bank, and then it was the weekend, and by the time I was able to get the bank, the price had gone to almost $200...  I figured it was a momentary spike, and was going to wait till it dropped down a bit before buying any.
The price didn't drop down, but kept going up and up and up.  I needed to make a purchase with btc, and so bought $50 worth at a little under $1000, and then the price went back down...

What makes you think a bitcoin channel should be an advertising avenue for discussing something that is NOT bitcoin?  Want to discuss altcoins?  Go somewhere else to discuss altcoins.   Of course posts about alternatives to bitcoin are censored... they are not on topic.
