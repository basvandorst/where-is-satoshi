I am also a programmer, and I find it suspicious that you say you can 'test everything'. For any test suite there's a one line bug producing change that will still keep the test suite passing...
The only way you can *prove* correctness of a program is to do formal verification. That is *difficult*. I don't know if the bitcoin script language is turing-complete; if it's not, the task gets somewhat easier. But still hard.
There's no test suite in any nontrivial project that checks *all* inputs and outputs. NASA might have more tests than Rovio, but they still have bugs. See Mariner 1, Mars Polar Lander, Spirit rover, etc etc.

Who the fuck pays an ATM withdrawal fee? Is that a thing in the US?
Living in the UK, 90% of atms are free to withdraw from, only ones in small shops etc (as opposed to at bank branches / public buildings / large stores) have fees, and they have to tell you what the fee is before you withdraw.
Also, who even uses cash nowadays...

It's not really a big deal for me; I'm more concerned about the mutliple hours of work to wipe all my machines and reset my passwords. And if my work laptop was compromised (unlikely - it had nothing to do with bitcoin, ever), then that's even more work to do ;_;
I have a windows and a mac; however the windows machine has been offline for the last three weeks or so... I think. If I left it plugged in I'll be very embarrassed!
It seems unlikely that this was compromised long ago if they only transfered funds now. So either someone spent significant amount of time brute-forcing the password...
Or what? I dunno. The thing is I haven't went to the site in *ages*, so I don't think it could have been something just trying to intercept my password.

Right, I'm sorry for hyperbolising that much. I agree bitcoin contracts are *useful*. I just don't believe they could ever fulfil the role that lawyer designed contracts fulfil now. They're a separate tool that just name clashes with law contracts.
There are still a couple problems with the picture that you draw.
Firstly, while the "contract coders" might be cheaper than any lawyer (which I doubt - there are lawyers that you can hire fairly cheaply to design a small contract, and for a big contract you'll want a big name bitcoin code company anyway), in an unregulated context there's a big risk of it becoming a lemon market.  
There's no real way for a user to establish if an unknown contract coder is good or not. Security of more sophisticated, custom contracts will be very hard to prove - as with software security anywhere, it works until it stops, and there's little chance of catching it beforehand unless someone can do the formal analysis.
Whether your coder is legit or an amateur does not matter much when you hire him to make a website for you - after all, you as the owner don't care about all the passwords that might be stolen from your site, or that it might be defaced someday. At least until you've already won big.
But with code specifically produced to handle money and obligations, the risk of failure is much, much higher.

@_date: 2014-06-11 10:49:14


The problem is that deciding on earnings might be sacrificing long term worth of the currency. If the pool does reach 51%, you can't say a 51% attack is unlikely because it's expensive - it's no longer expensive for at least some users. Even if they don't actually execute the attack, it's damaging to the currency.
And perhaps that's good, perhaps the assumption that miners would take future worth into account when distributing mining power and thus prevent 51% is wrong, and the coin deserves to crash because it's unsafe due to this mistake. But, well, this decision is up to the miners I suppose.
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:02:48
Well, I think the discussion on bitcoin talk was more interesting. To be honest, I'm not sure where you should go to get actual (technical/financial) support; however for general discussion and reinforcement I'd try lesswrong.com in addition to places that you've already posted. And the open thread on Hansons blog, perhaps?
Good job with the paper, it's clear you've thought this through :)
Edit: Saying 'I don't think reddit is the right place to post this, anyway' was a mistake from me; what I meant was "You're unlikely to get the support you're looking for in here; this is much heavier content than what reddit appreciates and rewards", not that you've made a mistake posting it here.

So you trade an obscure contracting system where you have to hire an expensive specialist to prepare the contract for you for an obscure contracting system where you have to hire an expensive specialist to prepare the contract for you and then if the contract is wrong you hire another expensive specialist to sue the first expensive specialist / your partner to recover the contracted moneys?

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:51:26
You're still basically gambling over the duration of your averaging period, and I don't think it actually reduces the variance on average (but I can't be bothered to do the maths right now). From symmetry, if DCA made sense in a given spot, it would also make sense to just cash out part of your existing investment in that spot (modulo transaction costs, obviously, but we're simplifying). Say you have $10k cash and are considering daily cost averaging 2k/month over 5 months; it's equivalent to consider having $10k bitcoin and withdrawing 8k today to reinvest over the next 5 months. Which I think everyone agrees is just silly gambling.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:26:34


Dollar cost averaging doesn't actually work though. See for example [this calculator]( DLA is purely a psychological tool that makes it easier for uncommitted investors to keep investing on a long term schedule; but investing in bulk is more efficient long term.

The trades within mtgox are rolled back, but if someone already withdrew the BTC, MtGox cannot do anything about it.
The $1000 limit on BTC withdrawal means that the attacker could only withdraw 100k BTC (at current price of 0.01$ / BTC when his attack was complete), but if the transaction was completed, the coins are gone.
On the other hand I see no recent ~100k BTC transaction on block explorer, so perhaps other value was used as BTC value when calculating the $1000 limit. Then the attacker might not have pulled out that many coins.
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:13:25
Slightly above 500000 BTC would be enough to fill all the orders. I don't think anyone with that amount of coins would be stupid enough to sell all at the same time.
So yes, mtgox bug or hacked. Expect a rollback (they better keep backups!)

$1000 with 0,01 per bitcoin is 100000 BTC - I'd take that.
This also means that the large transaction we were looking at some time ago (470 thousand BTC coalesced into one account) was actually a *deposit* into MtGox - someone's awfully rich. About 20% less rich now, though.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:33:30
The announcement clearly states it was one account, yet you insist multiple accounts were compromised. I'm not sure how else to present the facts than bolding the relevant part, since you clearly already read the announcement but failed to comprehend the meaning.

mtgox will have options soon, which should help quite a bit.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:29:00
No, MTGox will just bill the owner of the compromised account for the transactions it could not rollback. Unless the attack vector was within mtgox (which seems unlikely as only one account is said to have been compromised), it's the owner's fault that someone guessed his password - the trades are being reversed mostly to bring stability back to the market, rather than recoup losses to the account owner.
Assuming of course it was not their own house account. Then anything withdrawn comes from their pockets.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:25:32
Edit: nevermind, the salt is included in the dump.
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:19:22
I would not expect these trades to be honoured. The most likely explanation is that MtGox was hacked such that an account was filled with a huge amount of bitcoins, which it then immidiately sold off. If that's the case, MtGox will probably roll back the accounts to a backup and manually check all trades since the backup.
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:47:53
Keep in mind this is all conjecture - it is still more likely that mtgox moved the coins themselves, to prevent exactly this scenario (once you're hacked you don't know how much data the intruder stole - a new account is the proper reaction, since the private key was not known during the attack).
But, if it is a malicious user, then he most likely did not have access to the $ accounts of mtgox, only the bitcoin one. Consider how the exchange works (much simplified) : all coins are stored in one btc account, all dollars in one $ account. Trades between users are only reflected in the database of the exchange - one stores how many dollars and how many btc are owned to a particular user. Thus, if we know the private key for the btc account, we can trick the system into believing we are owned any amount of btc (make a 'deposit' transaction from the storage account to the storage acount, see your database balance increase dramatically). Then we can sell all those nonexisting btc on the market, increasing btc balance of other users and our dollar balance. Then, move the real BTC - any btc balance within the system becomes worthless. However, to move out the dollars, we need to use traditional banking, which usually takes a while, and transactions clearing out the account will usually ring alarm bells and cause the account owner to be contacted.
So I believe the $ were not moved away.
EDIT: alternatively, the large account was *not* MtGox's, and the transaction is a *deposit* to mtgox - then the sells might have been real. Hard to imagine anyone really selling 500k BTC like that though.

@_date: 2011-06-19 18:24:00
Context: A while ago, a [large coalescing transaction]( was assumed to be mtGox coalescing funds. Well, just now, the money was moved to a different account, and all mtgox bids were filled. Did someone hack mtgox and discover the private key of their storage account? Or is mtgox running away?
@_date: 2011-06-11 07:59:31
Unless the entire machine shuts down you should be able to do that by putting a small ramdisk (100mb sounds good) and copying the executable + required OS files there after boot (can make a script for that). Then it's only when the pc reboots that you need to go and plug the usb key in.

If they lost access to their storage account, all of the 'sells' did not actually happen - attempting to withdraw the bitcoins will fail as the mtgox account is empty. On the other hand the hacker can attempt to withdraw the dollar balance in any of the instant withdrawal methods - even though I wouldnt expect it to succeed, trying doesnt cost him anything.
The coins are gone though, nothing MtGox can do about that (assuming it's not them moving stuff around).
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:28:50

Self-regulation doesn't solve the problem, because you must plan for others failing to follow the rules. Unless you mean the kind where each actor agrees to be regulated by some power chosen in agreement with others - that might work if all agents agree, but as soon as someone breaks out you're back at square one.
Unless of course you decide to prevent the actors that refuse to play by the rules from doing harm - but that's not self regulation any more.

This seems to assume that actors acting in their own interest in an unregulated environment will always be better off than in a regulated one. That's obviously false. The most famous experiment, and I'm sorry I can't recall the name, goes basically like this:
A set of actors are given some funds, and told that every round they can put the money into a shared pool. The shared pool will be doubled and distributed evenly to all actors each round.
Clearly the best outcome is for everyone to put all their money in, and thus double the total economy every round.
However, when no options for regulation is offered, what happens is someone gets smart, and doesnt put everything in. Thus they invest less than others, and get the same amount, pulling ahead. Eventually, no one puts any money into the pool anymore.
However, if the players are allowed to regulate the economy - for example by fining actors who do not contribute fully - then everyone puts all their money in and the total worth doubles up each tick.

And presumably there is some reason why you do that. There's some reason why calling them e-sports bothers you. What is it?

Yes, everyone going to a trade with a gun will surely make them safer.
Or you know, make people kill each other because they see the other person pulling a gun.
One of the two, for sure.

Except everyone knows dictionary definitions rarely reflect full usage of any particular word. That it did not catch up to modern usage, esp. in such a fresh context as competitive gaming, is not really surprising.
The essence of a sport is in the competition, not the physical exertion. Chess and go have always been sports, and they have very similar characteristics - in fact most competitive games are way more physically demanding than those.

Why not, if it's not that you think they don't 'deserve' that title?
@_date: 2013-01-09 19:58:40
Yes, of course I would. Why wouldn't you?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:55:39
Hey, I know. When trying to argue something, I'll reference the thing I'm trying to prove as an obvious truth in a comment about my opponent. That's certain to convince him!
Yes, I think carrying a gun has negative utility, and is more likely to get you killed than help you. Your point?
@_date: 2013-07-18 10:41:39


What happens then is that no one takes any trades, because simply knowing that the other person wants to sell to you makes you unwilling to buy. See also: lemon markets.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:48:01
You're not very bright either, are you?

A much more likely bug is that they forgot to draw the flat line after the last ask.

The amount is probably still denumerated in PLN, it's just converted into BTC and sent to wallets instead of wired to a bank account. So legally speaking the person is paid in PLN, but they convert to BTC.

It's not a pyramid, it's a chain. A pyramid requires multiple people to fund profits for one person.
@_date: 2013-07-18 10:39:43
It creates the wrong incentives. In a situation where one is not required to disclose information before trading on it, "the result is not profit but chaos, as traders throughout the market refused to deal with you; just conditioning on the fact that you wanted to sell or buy from them, was reason enough for them not to."
The value of a market is not in distributing information, but in interpreting it. But how can you interpret information that's not available to you?
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:27:52
You'd have to suspect the other party to know something about the item that you do not to have a lemon market. It works both ways, except it's incredibly rare for the *buyer* to know more about a physical item than a *seller*, so it doesn't occur as often.
That is exactly what insider trading is.

Easy to prove:
- all arguments eventually devolve into hitler arguments (see Godwin's law)
- hitler arguments can easily be transformed into gun control arguments:
- - `if hitler didn't have guns he couldnt do all that stuff`
- - `if all jews had guns they could defend themselves from hitler`
- Thus all arguments are really gun control arguments, QED
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:00:41
I see. Then what you mean is that the other person will read your mind, know that you have a gun, and therefore not scam you. Makes sense now!

Jeff has recently updated his blog post, stating that the reliability issues seem gone:

No, a pyramid scam is a scam because people believe it's an honest deal. This is no scam, it's clear that someone else must buy the gem from you in order for you to make a profit. It's a simple bet.

You chose that statement as your title, that's the only reason I was addressing it.
@_date: 2013-01-27 22:04:24
Then you should be buying it, right now.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:35:30
No, by the definition in common usage. But if you insist, you can just take any of the alternative meanings for the word:








Holy shit, it's almost like there's as many definitions as dictionaries!
@_date: 2013-07-18 17:55:21


Publishing it somewhere is sufficient. The point is that your trading partners should have the ability to draw conclusions from the same dataset that you access. Only then does the market meaningfully predict events.


Nowhere near as fast as when you're obliged to disclose the information before trading on it. If you trade, you provide information that you think the price is too high or too low. That is how we establish the *interpretation* of facts. It's only efficient when the facts are already publicly available.

Or, people will realize it's a bad idea immediately, but count on other people not realizing as soon, thus betting on others being more stupid in order to make some money.
It's a pretty safe bet.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:11:55
Do you think the price will get back soon? If yes, don't. If no, then do.
Do you need the money? If yes, do. If not, don't.
Seriously, you're not going to make a quick buck on bitcoin. Don't buy / keep it to speculate with it. Either buy it to use it (services, drugs, whatever, not my business), to hedge for it becoming huge in the long term (in which case buy a small amount and hold forever), or get rid of it. Leave speculation to people who fool themselves to actually understand the markets.
//disclaimer: I don't own bitcoin right now, but I'll probably buy in for 5-10 coins once I have some time to set up a secure wallet.

But, on the other hand, you have to be on call, and you don't know when your order is filled. You have to keep updating the price, monitoring other ads... All this effort might not be worth it.

Yes, in general deriving a public key from a private key is hard, but for practical reasons pretty much all algorithms make it easy.
