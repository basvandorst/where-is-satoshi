@_date: 2019-07-07 08:18:00
You know, something I've always wondered is that why do bulls who are so certain of a price in the future even share that information publicly. I wouldn't share next week's lottery numbers or Apples Q4 earnings if I know them, I'd quietly use them to get rich. Is it unbounded altruism that you guys want your fellow man to be rich, or is it more that you need guys like me to buy into the hype to actually realise your prediction?

If you are never selling, that means you're a true believer of bitcoin. You believe it will form the bedrock for the world economy for all foreseeable future.
Of course, if you ARE a true believer, you wouldn't care what the btc usd rate is. You wouldn't care what other people do - in fact you would want the price to tank so you can get more coins. You wouldn't make posts like this.
Shills are not true believers. Either consciously or unconsciously, there IS a price at which they will sell, which is why they try with titty sucking might to push the price to that level.

Okay so you are saying BTC is a pump and dump scam? Why on earth should anyone knowingly get involved then?
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:20:32
Here's my 2 cents (or 50 cents if you want to believe I'm a FUD troll blah blah whatever)
China will never accept a decentralised currency outside of its control. Anyone remotely knowledgeable of the CPC, their cultural mentality (authority = safety), and their current currency manipulation, can see this. The only reason crypto is getting a free pass at the moment is because it's a western novelty, it fits in with the narrative of a technocratic society, and most importantly *it is utterly insignificant next to other epayments*, like alipay or wechat.
A currency not supported by China is a currency that will never see global adoption. Like it or not, they are the gatekeepers, now and for the next decades. They hold the keys to Asia, Africa, and likely Europe soon with the current US isolationism. This is a fundamental reason why I don't think BTC will take off.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:41:08
The exchanges act as the authority. Guess what happens when people dump into exchanges and no one buys. You're right, there's no obligation for people to sell bitcoin, but as you can see that hasn't stopped the fact at all. Call it a psychological margin call if you want. Time will tell whether the analogy is correct or not; point is it's not inconceivable for multiple people to independently latch on to this idea.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:30:05

Garbage article..shit like this is is why some people here are so deluded. It offers no arguments from fundamentals, and is basically saying "look! BTC graph is like Amazon's from a few years ago! That must mean it will succeed!". You might as well be reading tea leaves and tarot cards then.

This is actually a really interesting article but I doubt OP read any of it. This is about artisanal gold mining by the impoverished, not industrialised mining by conglomerates. Not saying it's right, but the 170 000 acres destroyed is about 0.01% of the total 1.7 billion acres - asking why the media didn't report it is like asking why didn't the local papers report on that homeless guy who litters.

This is a false analogy. The internet is analogous to blockchain, which I agree is here to stay. Bitcoin is analogous to the websites in late 90s that promised wealth out of thin air, and we all know how that ended.

That's the problem with a speculative asset with no underlying, fundamental value. The minimum is theoretically 0. In practice, it will probably be determined by the number of people willing to hold to 0 and never sell.

You do one unit of work for Jim. Jim does ten units of work for Alice. Alice has 5 goats each representing 2 units of work. You are hungry and want half a goats worth of meat. Without fiat money, Jim would have to get the goats from Alice, slaughter one, give you half. Imagine a chain like this of a hundred people, you would starve before you get your goat meat. Instead the government says, your one unit of work is worth 100 dollars. Alice's goat, based on supply and demand, are worth 200 dollars. You can now go straight to Alice to get the meat and have it ready by dinner. Fiat money is essentially a standardised representation of your work and contribution to society, validated and guaranteed by the authorities of the society you are contributing to, to allow goods and services flow freely within the society without having to physically exchange hands.
The same concept applies to bitcoin - each bitcoin is a representation of the work done by miners, but with one difference - the work done by the miners do not benefit society at all, and in fact only takes up resources. It's only purpose is to validate the transaction of bitcoins, which is like circular logic - to get bitcoin you must do work, but the work you do only serves to send bitcoins - it's a enclosed environment that does not benefit people like Alice whatsoever, so she asks why are you telling me my goats are each worth two bitcoins. 
This is the true reason why bitcoin is worthless - not because it's not backed by anything physical, but because it's is a representation of the work required for itself to exist, and nothing else. If instead, say, goats can be transferred via blockchain technology, and work is performed to validate this transfer (as opposed to relying on the government to guarantee), then goatcoin would have intrinsic value.

Can you explain what network value is then? Work done to mine bitcoins is solely used to validate transfer of bitcoins, that to me is a closed circuit that generates 0 net value for society as a whole. Now you might say that the decentralised and secure nature of bitcoin is it's worth, which then I ask, what stops anyone else setting up another decentralised network? What makes bitcoin intrinsically have value that other crypto do not have, other than that bitcoin arrived first and has had more time with speculators?

@_date: 2018-12-18 15:40:24
That's a lot of words but, correct if I'm wrong, all you're saying is that the value comes from having a lot of people in the network and also constantly having people joining the network. Not to invoke a tired analogy, but that is basically how Ponzi schemes is kept running and creating "value". You know why Ponzis collapse? Because it's a closed loop and it produces no benefits to society, sounds a tad familiar doesn't it.
It's also interesting you brought up social networks. While they certainly have value, a pure social network is not sustainable - like the Ponzi, you need a constant injection of new data, new users, to keep it going. Once it reaches saturation, it slowly dies out. Facebook knows this, which is why they are monetising the data on the social networks like crazy - sometimes immorally or illegally. It's also why they are aggressively expanding into other areas with the money realised from social networks instead of reinvesting it into that aspect of the business - because they know it is on a timer.

There's plenty of good material out there to read if you are actually interested in why we use fiat money; it's too big a topic to explain in full in one comment. The bottomline is that fiat at the most basic level represents work done  to transfer goods and services between individuals in a network, thereby having net value. Bitcoin represents work done to transfer bitcoin (and nothing else, this is the key point) in a network - it generates no external benefits and therefore has no intrinsic value. Anything with no intrinsic value is at the mercy of manipulation by people who control its speculative value.
