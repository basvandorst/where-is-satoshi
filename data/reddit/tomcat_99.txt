I have 2fa on blockchain.info account. So to access wallet I need 4 things:
- wallet id
- password
- my phone
- access to email
It's quite impossible to compromise all those things..

It was a valid transaction:
 
What is strange: I got txt message from blockchain.info about transaction but not all btc was transferred.

Why I wrote this?
If you guys have more than few $$ - buy a hardware wallet and backup private keys offline.

Email is to enough to login - I have also 2fa enabled. And I had my phone close a whole night (it's not possible someone used it).

Do you know how sms messages are sent? Only imported aderesses were affected and I'm wondering if someone could have access to private keys and import it to other wallet. Is sms sent in such case as well?

I was my suspicion. Thx you for this info.

Using backup makes sense if you can't access your wallet. In this case it's useless - this tx was confirmed so you can't cancel it.
