It wasn't a bruteforce. It was a XOR that gives you that 7. You can see this by XORing the whole second hash with that hidden one. It is just that byte was a tricky one, since it was split. You don't XOR the 3, but you do xor the 1 and the 6, so you get 7.

I am stuck. I noticed that hastebin takes arguments of 10 letters and that the code in  is 80 letters long. I split the code in 8 texts. I tried first letters of each text, last ones, took first bit of the first letter in a little text then second of the second one and so on until I had a letter for each text and put it together. None worked. Also tried using one time pads to encrypt/decrypt little text with the next one and use the result to encrypt/decrypt the with the next one and so on...
Number in  is a 512bit number, some private keys are that big, but usually they are 256. Multiplying it by anything gives a number bigger then 512bits so that is a bummer. Tried with mod 2^256 couple of multiples of that number, but no luck. Have no clue what that 0 is for, adding it obviously does nothing.

You did. Congrats. I was so happy when I did and now I got pissed...Man..I had it..should have used an online wallet...
Tough luck...

I figured it out and while I was rescaninig someone took them. God dammit.

Just download the Electrum wallet and add that private key. It should be very straight forward.

This one is harder...

It is probably not a coincidence that letters with bigger numbers associated with them are rarer.

Yeah, I guess. Thank you man.I wish you luck as well. Thanks again for the gold, very cool of you.

Yeah. Good job. Will get Electrum or an online wallet for the next one. You were smarter, you deserve it. I was too relaxed, celebrated and all, thought that there was no way that after more then 12 hours someone figured it out in 10 minutes of me. I was wrong to say the least...
