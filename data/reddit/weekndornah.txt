Might hit $1200 on Coinbase by midnight here in the US!

I used part of my student loans disbursement (I'm in grad school) to buy bitcoin. I have 4 BTC right now. Hodling on to 2 until 2020 at least (my graduation date), and the other 2 I'll sell short-term in 2017

Alright I'm in a weird situation here.
I'm TECHNICALLY a Hawaii resident (have a Hawaii driver's license), but I live on the mainland. My Coinbase account is funded through a mainland bank, and my current location and mailing address is on the mainland, but I use a Hawaii phone number. Apparently I have verified with my driver's license, which was Hawaii but I did not personally receive the email re: ceasing operations and clearing my account. 
What do!!?!?!?!

I mean I was born and raised in Hawaii, I have a Hawaii Driver's License, and renewed it a few years ago. I do not have anything to technically prove myself as a Hawaii resident when I have to renew my DL in 2019 though. My parents took me off of their household at my insistence (they live in affordable housing, I would jack up their rent). No Hawaii accounts, but I do get a few random things billed to Hawaii / have it as my permanent address.
Does that mean I'm in limbo, with no practical residency?

I was planning on selling fractions of the 2.01 BTC in Coinbase every few months as I see fit, but obviously this kinda complicates things.
I COULD go without the money from selling off the bitcoin (I was planning on hodling the other 2.01xx in blockchain until at least 2020), so now this makes me consider consolidating everything into one wallet.
I just signed up for Kraken but I gotta send them an email about my legal Hawaii residency but having everything in a continental US state.

Can someone ELI5 buy and sell orders and that graph to me?
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:37:51
I can't buy anymore. I bought 2.01 BTC while drunk like two weeks ago when it dipped, averaging $1,180 per.
Not gonna lie I'm conflicted right now

Yup, just gonna watch another episode or two of Scrubs and sleep it off.
