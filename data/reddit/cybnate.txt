Nothing at stake is a myth:
"All work on proof-of-stake has gone on outside of the bitcoin core dev community... ...The slogan and the backstory are misinformation. ..." (

Yes, paper wallets, same way as you would do with Bitcoin.
e.g. with this tool:

There is not even a promise that someone solves the problem of 51% attacks soon.

It is a pity that this thread is dominated by one and no comments are made whether this is a useful and practical service to support Bitcoin adoption as many others are offering in this reddit.
I was hoping for a bit more open mindedness and some constructive feedback, but no luck.
Will take the feedback from trowthecan aboard that people don't have the time to investigate every altcoin on its merits and see how to get the coin itself and its philosophy a bit more known and visible as a complimentary coin to Bitcoin.

No, it is not posing and there is no S*. It is a wallet which can be used to pay with Bitcoin without having users to be exposed to Bitcoin volatility which is a huge problem for adoption. That is clear as there are many Bitcoin startups trying to address this issue with more or less success. NuDroid tries to address it in a different way by combining some services in a smart way.
Happy to have it reviewed. I'm sure it can stand the tests, although improvements are always possible and development is ongoing.

This is a useful service for Bitcoin users, nothing to do with S*
Combining services to enhance Bitcoin experience is the way to go

Same here in New Zealand. Teared envelope in such way that it is a wonder that the device was still in there. Hologram seals broken.
It is clearly an item of interest for customs around the world. Won't use it for a while, but hope others do and find out whether there is anything wrong with it.
