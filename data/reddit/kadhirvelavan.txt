Better to have 2 hardware wallets since we need to play with our private keys quite often to get our forks.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:04:11
So what do you say in short. Why does one work for non -profit. Do they get the salary?
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:17:24
This article encourages equal participation from "Fairer sex". Women don't get interested in Blockchain nowadays.

Sorry, I am not aware of Neon with Ledger hardware wallet. Need to experiment that separately and see the results. Can you try with an empty wallet and tell us if you would see the keys in the system memory?
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:34:33
Also, she is a strong advocate of blockchain and bitcoin technology.
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:53:02

I didnt get you
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:26:54
Jimmy wrote this article after visiting Korea seeing people lacking the basic understanding of Bitcoin. So we cannot say that this is expected from Jimmy. There are lot many people who don't understand the basic things.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:56:56
Yes lot of money
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:45:26

He got Fedup with immature journalists who don't know the basics of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-04-10 04:03:28

Rhett is a scammer and he has forked lot of times.
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:45:56
Educate them and create awareness and that we can do.

Not sure

Yes 20X

It is really surprising that Scalability feature is completely ignored in these BIPs. We were of the impression that Schnorr will compress more signatures in a block and help in accommodating more transactions in a block.
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:15:49
Bitcoin blocks include thousands of signatures, and I estimate from the top of my head that signatures make up more than a third of the blockchain data. Simply by being more compact, Schnorr signatures would reduce the blockchain data footprint by a few percentage.
@_date: 2019-05-07 06:08:27
We can't reduce the current blockchain size.
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:47:48
True it is really good for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-07 06:22:16
This is not Windows 10 upgrade. It will take time and also it needs consensus.
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:47:38
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:12:35
No, this is unique and accurate prediction and not the one by a random guy on the internet.
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:16:23
Pieter Wuille estimated that purely from aggregating signatures for each transaction and leaving everything else the same, the Bitcoin blockchain would be between 25% and 30% smaller
