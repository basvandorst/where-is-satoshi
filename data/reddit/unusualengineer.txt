How did you guys wire transfer with RBC? I have a student checking account and want to wire to Kraken.
However, I do not see that option online, so I have to go to the bank and make a wire?
Also, Kraken has a canadian bank in Canada now, so I am wiring money inside Canada and not the US?
Please tell me how you guys did it, I'm so confused

'' bitcoin challenge where BTC is to be found, hidden in a digital picture ''
Do you mean there are 3 BTC addresses in the photo or there is a hidden message I have to figure out?
Also, can anyone figure it out or do you need prior knowledge of something (ex: coding) ?
PLEASE  REPLY, AND THANK YOU !
