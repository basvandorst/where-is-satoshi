Personally hoping for an epic collapse so I can get some more money into it.

Today was the last straw. Their service has been absolutely useless for the past week. Just got the verification process on gemini started and won't be looking back. In theory coinbase is awesome but in execution it's terrible.

I only use Coinbase because it's so easy but a lower fee would be a handy thing for me considering I've been dumping a small weekly amount in BTC for a while. Those small fees add up over time. Is Gemini as easy to use as Coinbase?

I see so many different opinions posted every time something like this comes up. Some people say Coinbase is fine, others say it isn't. Some people say a wallet like Electrum is fine, others say it isn't. While looking at the Electrum app just now I noticed it has absolutely miserable reviews. I just want something simple to safely store my coins on that I purchase weekly from coinbase. I've been dropping a small amount of cash into BTC weekly for a while now and I plan on hodling them for a long time but I'm always turned off by how difficult safely storing them is. If Coinbase isn't safe, what is the easiest, safest solution?

BTC is tracking to hit 2000 bucks in the next few hours, not days.

They literally did.

Then that's his own fault. Trying to glean any actual information from a single sentence title on reddit is pointless. reddit is a content aggregate, not title aggregate. Especially on a sub like people should RTFA.

My point is, every single bit of profit you've made so far is going to end up money lost years from now. Like, a LOT of money lost. That bit of profit you made will likely be worth an order of magnitude more money in the future. I wasn't trying to say it's not possible to make short term gains but it's also just wasting money trying to do that. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:45:58
When I said most people I didn't mean literally everyone. I also store my coins safely but you and I and the people of this sub are a tiny, tiny fraction of all bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:48:45
I hope it goes much lower than that. Why would anyone not want it to drop at this point? If you're in Bitcoins trying to make money on a day to day basis you're doing it wrong. I want it to plummet so I can buy a lot more coins for cheaper (for the long term). 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:35:12
'most people' is a reach; in fact I would bet that the vast, vast majority of people that buy bitcoins do in fact buy and store them on an exchange like Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:32:23
Man there sure are some negative people in the bitcoin community. I don't know what it could be other then jealousy, considering you're now playing with house money, still have an obviously substantial amount of coins and have changed your life for the better in numerous ways. I think this post is amazing. And while I'm probably holding less than one percent of what you recently sold I'm excited as hell about the prospects. Congratulations.

It's going to be fucking awesome. I can't wait for the next btc crash. I'm going to load the fuck up and not be mad at myself for once. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:21:15
I recently switched to Gemini and every single thing about it is better than Coinbase so far, in my experience. I don't know if they do LTC or not but I know you can buy/sell ETH/BTC with it. The fees are no joke less than 5% of Coinbase's fees. I love it. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:23:26
Those are just ridiculous statements. Do you have a bank account? A savings account? A 401k? Credit cards? A home loan? Car loan? In every one of those instance you're entrusting many thousands of dollars to some 3rd party to do your security for you. 
Regardless, we've gotten off topic anyway. I'm not against securing your coins. But to act like Trezor is some kind of risky, unsafe method of doing so is ridiculous. The vast majority of Bitcoin is stored in exchanges like Coinbase and using Trezor will be plenty enough security for 99.99% of the BTC userbase. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:34:35
You're missing the point, mate. I don't think anyone is arguing that your method is safer (though I don't really know either way), but you have a set of instructions that 99% of folks here (myself included) don't know how to follow. I literally don't know how to do a single thing you just said, or what any of those terms even mean. 
A lot of the smart bitcoin folks around here don't understand how hard some of this shit is for laymans like me. I consider myself a pretty tech savvy person but I've been browsing this subreddit for months and still don't understand just about anything; I've tried to read 5 different articles on the scaling debate and still don't have a clue what's really happening, I see terms thrown around here on every single thread that don't make sense to me and googling them leads absolutely nowhere because I don't understand the explanations. 
So yes, it's very worth it for me to spend 50 more bucks for a super simple method to safely store my coins. I will risk the .0000001% chance of some kind of attack, considering for the longest time my coins sat in either the generic exchange wallet or an Android app wallet I downloaded myself.

I hope the price continues to plummet so I can get some cheap coins. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:44:05
I bought a shitload more when it crashed most recently. I don't know why anyone would ever want to invest in Bitcoin as a short term money maker. The real profits will always be in the long run and I will always buy when it has a substantial dip. I LOVE seeing the price drop.
