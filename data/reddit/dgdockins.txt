Is this sarcasm‽

Because of [Metcalf’s Law]( The value of the network equals the number of users squared. May not be $20,000 but closer to $14,000 :-)   Certainly not $10 or $1000.

No, that affects but it’s not where the majority of the value comes from. Even if the number of buyers flatlined, value would continue to rise if more and more vendors accepted it. Even if they immediately converted it to fiat. When 2nd layers provide millions of t/s for next to no fee, as Bitcoin became more and more usable it’s value would still go up. There is speculation involved right now, as you would expect with any new tech, but it’s value comes from the benefits of use it offers its users.

If you have faith in your currency because it's backed by the brute force of government, rather than the currencies ability to act as a vehicle to trade value, don't be surprised when your counties  commodity and export is brute force. Have fun with that.... I'll take Bitcoin thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:31:54
Agreed. I’m a nurse. Love Bitcoin and am so excited to see where it goes. Already have more in my Bitcoin saving than in my traditional retirement. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:49:08
Your example with the pizza makes Bitcoin more scarce. It took 10,000 BTC to buy a pizza before. Now more people want to own Bitcoin so it's more scarce. So 1 BTC is worth more so you can buy a lot more. Say you did what you said and divided up the bitcoins into such small pieces called BLAHs. Now it takes a trillion BLAHs just to buy one stick of gum. Well, if there are still so many BLAHs in each Bitcoin and I own 21 Bitcoins, I still own 1 millionth of all the BLAH's in existence. And if you cut the BLAHs in half, still own 1 millionth. Doesn't matter how much you divide it the whole amount is the same, you just chopping it up into little pieces.

Not saying this is what happened at all, but if I was Satoshi and I didn't want people to know, the first thing I would do is leave lots of very obscure and faked evidence that I could be Satoshi. If anyone every caught on to me the skeptics would find the trail of breadcrumbs and do the work for me. I don't think CW did that but that would be the desired effect in the scenario I just laid out. Now I'm confused. Guess I'll just go back to watching the trip to the MOON!!!
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:15:50
That sounds like the right answer.  But what's the ultimate question‽ 
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:30:19
That would make sense but I helped him moved the bitcoin.  We did import the wallet to breadwallet. Then sent the balance to his trezor. That was on November 16th. Then the Bcash moved to his trezor’s Bcash wallet on December 29th. Could breadwallet do that on its own? Doesn’t make sense to me. Happy whatever happened did though. He still has all his funds. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 00:04:45
LOL. I looked for him but couldn't find him. Should have looked on my iPad instead of the phone. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 17:39:34
I'm assuming the "?" is b/c you don't know what the changetip was about. He just sent you about $5 USD using Changetip. You will get information letting you know how to retrieve the tip. It's a micropayment service. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:18:51
Awesome! Sounds like he was paying attention. :-) 
@_date: 2016-06-02 14:20:03
Was he in the audience at Andreas "Blockchain" vs Bitcoin talk‽ Sure sounds like it. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:08:07
Don't know about the other stuff but you can buy Bitcoin within the app. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:36:42
Thanks so much. Appreciate the thorough response. I'll check out Electrum. Breadwallet has been really user friendly. Been using it a couple of years and this is the 1st time I've had the issue.
@_date: 2016-11-25 13:34:50
Thanks for responding. You were right, it's completed now. For future reference, if it continued to not go through, what would happen and how long would it take? What could I have done? Should I use a different wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:14:15
So since December of 2015 Bitcoin has overtaken silver and is about overtake the billionaire's club. I think Gates is up in the 80's now but Bitcoin is not too far off. This chart reads like Arya Stark's hit list. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:30:21
[just select Bitcoin at the checkout]( You get a discount vs CC payments as well. I think 4%. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:08:23
He doesn't mention paper wallets at all. I do keep some of my coins on a Trezor, but the majority of my savings are in password protected paper wallets in a secure fire/security safe with off site backup in an undisclosed location. Is that a bad choice?
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:57:35
Thx :-)
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:27:45
Yeah. fixed it for me. It's 1.5x slower according to their video. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 04:17:13
It says it's 1000x faster than NAND which is 1500x slower than DRAM. So it's 500x slower than DRAM.  The advantage seems to be you get the affordability and non-volatility of NAND without loosing quite as much speed, but it is slower. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:20:31
"Bitcoin is the sizzle, blockchain is the steak". LOL how long are they going to stay in the denial phase? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:06:35
That makes sense. Good point. Maybe acceptance is closer than we think. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:22:45
1 beer @_date: 2015-08-01 12:25:09
LOL. Thanks! The really sad part is I had to stop and think if you were right. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:00:09
A lot of the early adopters are hardcore Libertarians and Anarchocapitalists. You won't get too much sympathy with that position. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 00:09:59
LOL. Love the catch phrase at the end. Always at your side :-)  Decent April Fools. Still need to watch "History of the Fanny Pack" link though. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 16:25:14
Thx! I've used breadwallet for a long time and have never had any issues that rescanning the blockchain or turning my wifi off wouldn't fix. Once I get my IOS updated so I don't have to worry about "error 53" I will restart phone and may rescan one more time. If that doesn't work I'll contact support. Thanks! :-)
@_date: 2016-02-20 15:21:32
Holy crap. Thanks! Totally missed that. That's been stressing me to no end because my screen keeps flickering at the top and stops responding to touch. I have 9.2.1 so I guess I can restart finally. Thx!!
 
 EDIT: looks like I need to connect to iTunes to get the "updated version" or 9.2.1. Says it won't work for those who update over air. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 14:03:35
Went to bed to do just that.  It's been roughly hours. Will check blockchain.info now. Thx. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 14:46:09
Checked blockchain.info and it says the same thing Bitref etc. said. &gt;60 conf. I guess it's definitely in the paper wallet. THX. It just keeps showing in the breadwallet. Tried resyncing a few times. No change. Don't want to restart phone b/c I had broken screen replaced a few months back. Worried I'll get an error 53. :-/ I think I'll start a new wallet. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:46:07
My trezor shows me the address I'm sending to on its display and asks me to confirm. It signs the transaction for that address so I'm not sure how the computer being compromised would cause an issue. (Don't have an in depth understanding of this topic so I'm aware I may be making some incorrect assumptions).
@_date: 2016-02-20 16:19:53
Never scanned the private key. The option in Breadwallet says "import private key"
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:31:52
Just sayin, if you started as a burger flipper at McDonald's at 16 and stayed in the job till you retired you would make over a million dollars. In America the working poor are in the top 1 percent of the worlds wealthiest. One reason why the whole Occupy Wallstreet 99 percent thing was a little funny. Not much, but I get it. You say as much with "1st world problem" I guess. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 01:48:25
Do you feel that someone who gets a job flipping burgers at 16 and stays in the same job at the same salary of 20,000/year  until they are 80 deserves to be a millionaire? My comment was calculated at retirement age 66 though. The median household income is $51,000ish. You save some money. Buy a house. Get 30 year term life insurance while your healthy. Save some more money, eventually pay your house of in 30 years or so depending on how many times you refinanced. 30 year term expires but by then you should have everything paid off. Live off the savings (preferably the interest) you've been putting back all those years. 
Fact is, in most developed countries you have a less than 2 percent chance of ending up in poverty in you do 3 things
- graduate high-school
- get and keep one of your 1st jobs for a year
- don't have kids till you are married 
@_date: 2016-09-06 03:37:35
I save. I know people who save. We watch movies, tv, play games, etc. Are we immune to pre consumer media? Maybe some peoples purpose is to serve as a warning to others what not to do...
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:51:01
From that gif I thought he was just describing the fiat currency system. Was the socialism part in a full video link?
@_date: 2016-09-13 22:49:46
Yes. I thought I had updated the circle app but it had been put on hold. Finished the update and sent a dollar to my wif for services rendered. ;-)
@_date: 2016-10-28 00:36:51
Are there really this many people having so much trouble understanding OP's post. The worst part is that many seem so sure of them themselves. Just open your wallet and pretend to send someone 0.001 BTC. It will show you that you about to send about a dollar. It's not that complicated. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:48:20
Ernest Cline's "Ready Player One" :-)
@_date: 2016-05-26 22:59:20
I came here to ask just that. I transferred a couple of coins to my shift account and heading off to Lowe's to get some patio furniture. Doing some window shopping and waiting. Been an hour since I sent it. Breadwallet shows 0 confirmations as well. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 01:08:15
Finally went through. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 23:32:15
There have been 4 blocks mined since I sent my transaction. 
413,561-413,564. My transaction hasn't been included in any of them. Sent 1 Bitcoin with a $0.07 fee. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 23:10:27
Still 0 confirmations on my breadwallet. And funds I transferred still pending on Coinbase. On the plus side I planned out a good misting setup for my patio set. I'm going to start looking creepy sitting in the outdoor furniture section. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 01:09:55
Went through after I went home. Reviews on the table that was on sale were crap so maybe it was Lord Nakamoto looking out for me.:-)
