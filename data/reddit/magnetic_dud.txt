What's Circle?

They also stole my coins

I was thinking that, being based in the US, they were already targeting the US market. I guess that they didn't find yet a good bank that's reliable enough to manage USD withdrawals

how to get the real btc address from bitpay???
I can't believe that when finally i found a real use case to pay with btc (store only accepts that!), i can't pay with that because there's no btc address at all!

Try to withdraw bitcoin, they charge 0.0005 btc while they actually pay 0.0000005 btc

I like to withdraw coins immediately after a trade, but with kraken the withdrawal fees are totally ridiculous (0,0005 btc!!!! 100 times the actual fee!)
Which exchange allows me to withdraw coins for reasonable fee?
coinbase pro was perfect, but 0.50% vs 0.16%....

in the end i paid cash... shame on bitpay, this was the perfect chance (store seller gave discount if you paid in btc)

withdrawal on kraken is 100 times the real withdrawal fee though

i meant the bitcoin withdrawal fee, 0.00005 btc

What really pissed me off is that Purse.io didn't do anything about it, could have asked a simple verification to the buyer. For them, the important is that the tracking said delivered.

Maybe amazon can ban my account?
