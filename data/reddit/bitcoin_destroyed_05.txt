Next up:
'For everyone freaking out about paying VAT on bitcoin in Europe'
I tried to warn you
Enjoy your regulation, taxes, frauds, scams, extreme volatility, and having to do biometric scans to get Bitcoin out of an 'ATM' for a 10% fee (+GST! lol!)
Enjoy it while it lasts.

So what? You admit it's all 'arguably' true, so what distinguishes Bitcoin from fiat?
The only way in which 'things might just work out' is that Bitcoin becomes Fiat 2.0, and who would have a need for that? Once the get rich quick element fades as Bitcoin is more widely adopted and the pool of potential buyers dries up, then there will be no point to using Bitcoin.
Of course it's highly unlikely it'll ever reach that stage, since the benefits are already gone and the 'get rich quick' attraction could already be gone. The price is down 60% since December 2013 - who would want to invest in that, unless they saw something other than get rich quick value in Bitcoin?

Why don't you address the substance of what I say rather than the person who says it?
Is it not true that Bitcoin's immunity to regulation and so forth have been overstated? Is it not true that everything I describe is in actual fact what we are and have been witnessing in Bitcoin, especially in more recent times?
