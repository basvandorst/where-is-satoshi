Another bitcoin site built by a bunch of 12 year olds? Yeah, we haven't seen this before.
If most of these operations are this shoddy, makes me wonder what kind of site I could build if I wanted to, because I know I can do better than that...

I sent them money, they failed to send me any bitcoins. I gave them plenty of info - the payment id, the bitcoin address that I entered into their website, etc. It took them 3 hours to get back to me, and it got more disorganized from there. There's not much I can do, they have my money and yelling at them won't get it back, but I can sure tell everyone that maybe you should buy your BTC via mtgox and leave Bitinstant alone.

Market order on MtGox if you're in a hurry, but I like to dick around with limit orders and save a little.
In my experience, the more middlemen you use between an exchange and yourself, the more things are likely to go wrong and the more cuts get taken.
As far as your questions go:
* No minimum, but you'll find that moving large amounts on an exchange and the exchange is going to want to know who you are, they're going to want some gubmint ID in their files on you
* Bitcoin is just cash. I'm sure people are working on Bitcoin derivatives but I'm not aware of any. Probably the first kind of Bitcoin derivative will be futures, then followed by options.
* MtGox is pretty darn reasonable. It's like 0.6% or something like that. They give your discounts on it the more you trade. However. People will clip you pretty hard getting cash to MtGox.

Meanwhile gold just sits there, with its thumb up its ass. Some of this may be bubbling, but I think some of it is that people are losing confidence in their fiat paper.
I mean, if I was Greek or Italian and I couldn't afford to park my money in Switzerland, and I knew about BTC, I'd be all over it like white on rice.
Makes me wish that I could've scaled in, in greater size when I did :P My gold may not be going anywhere for the time being, but my BTC position looks very nice indeed.
In any case, until the average noob is asking "wut is BTC lol", we're not at a manic stage yet. I mean, none of the people I know have BTC on their radar screens, or they just look at me and say the equivalent of "wut?".

Aside from a very few industrial/science applications, gold is more or less useless. Or silver does everything gold does for less.
Gold is rare and it's really hard to increase its supply. It's very unreactive to almost everything, and it's somewhat easy to work as a metal. Then again it's also very heavy as metals go and very soft.
BTC is set up to be finite in supply, guaranteed by mathematics. It's also unreactive towards everything, and it's much more divisible than gold could ever hope to be. It's also as light as your thumb drive and as durable as your thumb drive is.
But none of that matters as much as this. None of the big players in government or Wall Street are actively suppressing the price of BTC they way they are with gold. You can't naked short BTC, for instance.
My complaint about BTC is it's hard to move into it in any size. I wish my current position was bigger than it is right now :P

Nice thing about looking at the realtime BTC ticker, is that all the old T/A patterns actually work again. Like yes, it's in a real downtrend, or no that looks like another leg up.
With gold, you just have no fucking clue, it's like looking at a slot machine.

Their IRC was unresponsive - the lights were on but nobody was home. Their main phone line went straight to voicemail and it took 3 hours for someone to get back to me via email.
I gave them all the info about the transaction and it went into a black hole, basically.
If things go right with them, and you don't have to talk to them, great. But if things go wrong, don't expect any service from them at all.
Trustcash/Aurumxchange on the other hand, I've had zero problems with. Reliable as a rock those guys are.

Don't pay too much attention to the order book. Even the T&amp;S, most of what you see printing are very thin trades. It's the trades of size that matter. Wish there was a way to filter out all trades below a certain size.
Really, I think the only things that matter are the ticker, and the candle chart.
As far as the last few days go, we're in a correction. I find it very encouraging that it can't seem to go below the $8 handle without running into buying pressure.
Relax, it'll consolidate for awhile and then when people get comfortable with BTC having a $8 handle for a while, it'll start moving up again.
@_date: 2012-08-17 20:25:10
You don't know much about the gold market do you? It's blatantly manipulated. I wish I knew less about gold than I do, and that was more of a statement from me about how gold is being actively suppressed while BTC is not. Can't naked short BTC, as far as I can tell. 
You can have an expanding market without having mass appeal yet. I'm just saying, that it isn't a mania until the average person is aware of it. All bull markets depend on the masses not knowing about whatever it is until the end of the move. You don't know much about trading do you?
The last statement is true no matter how you want to spin it, nitpicker.
If you're long BTC, stop arguing with me and just enjoy the profits. If you're not, well I'm eating your lunch and it tastes good.
@_date: 2012-07-13 13:51:01
But hey, look on the bright side - if people didn't think bitcoins were actual money, they wouldn't bother to steal them at all. This is more of a statement about general financial website security (and lack therof with BTC startups) than it is about BTC itself.
I'm curious, are there any standards for financial website security? Like an (eww) ISO standard or something?
@_date: 2012-07-19 15:50:00
Naked shorting by the big bullion banks. The ticker behaving in weird ways. Artificially generated volatility at the same times every day. Observations about if you sold gold when COMEX was open and bought when it was closed you would've made 1000% more than the price of gold is now. 
I've watched my fair share of tickers, and the gold ticker smells to high heaven of blatant manipulation. 
@_date: 2012-08-07 13:59:51
You don't have to be that fancy. There's people on SR who will happily sell you their fiat local paper for your BTC. Of course that just transfers the risk to the um, ~~launderer~~ exchanger, but then again that's why money launderers exist in the first place anyway.
I suspect you'll have a whole section of people who specialize in nothing but taking your dirty coins and washing them bright and shiny clean again.

U.S. and direct to bitcoin address. Their intermediary ZipZap is not much better, although their customer service was much more prompt.
I'd chalk it up to both of them being disorganized startups. Either they'll fix these problems or they crash and burn. In the meantime, I'd stay away from Bitinstant.
@_date: 2012-08-02 23:51:37
True. But let's say that we're betting on something less - even in Weimar Germany during the 1920s, I'm sure the phones and mail still worked. I think it reasonable that if we're just facing a man-made econofuckup and not some pan-global earth disaster, that BTC will do well.
And there's something to be said for a hybrid approach with a core gold/silver physical postion surrounded by a smaller BTC position.
I'll also say something about rehypothecation and vaporization - in some ways a BTC position is less of a credit risk than say, a gold futures account. Seg funds, aren't anymore.
@_date: 2012-08-05 21:21:07

6% weekly is 52x6, or 312% APR. Even junk bonds don't pay that much! And junk bonds are called junk for a reason.
And this is in USD as well, a currency that's going DOWN in value. BTC is going UP.
You know what they say about something that's too good to be true, or trying to get something for nothing. And if you don't, give me your BTC and I'll teach you. Because I can promise you 20% every fortnight if you just give me your BTC.

I dunno. People are good at adapting to things like a *slowly* depreciating currency or a *slowly* appreciating currency. The Roman Empire lasted 400 more years after they started devaluing, but it happened slow enough for everyone to adapt to it. It did rot them out in the end but that's another story.
I think what gets people and economies into trouble is when the deflation or hyperinflation happens too fast to adapt to. Then like a Roomba that's stuck between a wall and a cliff, it'll convulse for a few cycles and then go into fault mode and stop working.
As long as people don't get cute with BTC and start layering on things like loans or futures or options, BTC should appreciate at a rate slow enough for people to adapt to.
But the honest truth is - nobody knows for sure. It's an experiment in progress and nobody knows if there are corner cases out there that weren't anticipated in the original design.

Gotta remember that people will be printing these out, not some asshole central bank gubmint. Color ink is more expensive than black. And even black ink (or toner) isn't exactly cheap for people who can't (or won't) refill their ink tanks.
My advice would be, if you're going to include art, to make it economical on the amount of ink used, and to use mostly black ink for the artwork.
Otherwise, if you're going the collectible route, there are already people who are minting physical bitcoins.
You might be able to mass produce something with full color artwork, with a space for the QR code to be printed. Maybe something with perforated edges to avoid having to cut the bills out of the paper sheet. But why ask teh intarwebs for ideas? 
Just start drawing and start selling and see what sticks. All teh interwebs is going to do is photoshop kittens onto whatever. And maybe do three rage comics in response to teh kittiez.

@_date: 2012-07-19 16:59:52
This. It would increase awareness manyfold over what it is right now.
I'd say the governments have been attacking bitcoin, but from the side not from the front - you think that all these "hacking stories" are just an accident? Most banks have even more lax security but you never hear about any hack attacks there.
They're really kind of in a bind here. They can't outlaw it, that will just make people want the things even more. They can't buy them up - same reason. They can try to discredit any exchangers. And maybe they can try to discredit the crypto foundations. It would not surprise me if some black project is trying to build some anti-miner to try to fork the blockchain. If they can't succeed at doing that, there's not much they can do to BTC that wouldn't hurt them more than it hurts the BTC economy.

Gold isn't really used as a medium-of-exchange anymore except between asshole central bankers. It's more or less a store-of-value for the rest of us.
As far as going back to a gold standard - look, the past 200 years of financial history has been one characterized by INSTABILITY. And for a good chunk of that time the world was on a gold standard more or less. Gold Will Not Fix It.
And if you're talking about making the shiny pieces of paper we call money convertible into gold again, that won't really help in the long run - at some point another Nixon will get the Bright Idea(tm) of just issuing the paper and telling people to go screw themselves if they want the gold behind the paper.
I'd rather see everyone using BTC than have myself or my descendants live through that particular story again.

The actual supply matters much less than the RELATIVE CONFIDENCE in the currency. It isn't so much that bitcoin has gained confidence, rather people are losing faith in the established currencies.
It speaks volumes that a relatively untested experimental cryptocurrency is gaining more confidence at the margin than dollars or euros. BTC is capturing a part of the anything-but-dollars/euros bid.
The other factor is that the traditional tools of price suppression and manipulation aren't available in the bitcoin market. No naked shorting, no futures, etc. In many ways, the bitcoin markets are - honest.
You think that you've seen volatility? Not really, not compared to the artificial volatility in the precious metals markets. BTC looks placid by comparison.
@_date: 2012-08-07 13:51:11
The only real contribution SR makes is to bolster confidence in the currency. If drug dealers will take whatever as payment, then it is real money. You could say that in some sense, bitcoins are backed by not gold but pot, meth, coke, shrooms, LSD, etc. BTC is backed by a basket of illegal drugs. You know (in theory) what that basket is approximately worth, and that you can always (in theory of course) exchange it for that basket.
I mean, really, that's what go me to take bitcoin seriously. Before that I thought it was something like WoW gold, instead of like physical gold.
Edit: And the worst thing they could do to BTC now that I think about it, is to legalize recreational drugs. That would pull the rug out from under BTC in a hurry.

Actually, no, as long as they get paid back. More lucrative to collect your principal+interest back in an appreciating currency. If you get paid back. Why would you want to make unsecured loans in an anonymous, untraceable (more or less) currency, I have no idea. Please tell me why this is a valid business model.
As a borrower you wouldn't want to borrow money in a deflationary environment. Bad enough you're paying interest, the principal itself is getting harder to pay back too.
In the bad old days (when money wasn't as inflationary) it was really hard to get credit. People forget just how tough getting a loan was at one point in time. The '90s and most of the '00s are not normal in terms of access to credit.

Basically PayPal and the CC companies forbid using their services to buy bitcoins. They've shut down people who have tried. Unless I'm wrong, there's no way you're going to conduct a BTC purchase without having to get up and go out into the Big Blue Room at some point.
You have several options left, all of them suck sorta. How bad do you want bitcoins?
* Wire transfer from your bank account to a bitcoin exchange, like mtgox
* Cash transfer through some intermediary to a bitcoin exchange
* Cash transfer to someone who will do the bitcoin trading and use something like coinapult to send the BTC direct to your wallet
* Hook up over the bitcoin OTC market and trade them a prepaid gift card or moneypak for BTC
* purchase a seller's account on Silk Road and list cash/moneypaks/gift cards for bitcoins, abide by all of the escrow and anonymizing rules.
