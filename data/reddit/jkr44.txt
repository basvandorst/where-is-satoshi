It is a big problem as our environment is already quite damaged and humanity should not destroy it more for virtual things.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:34:20
In a few years there will be other pyramid schemes in vogue and investors will be most probably looking for different "get rich quick" opportunities.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:58:47
But they will at least make rich those that came before them. :-D
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:02:37
Opening heart to those that open wallets a give you money is a good deal. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:50:55
Stop loss is basic instrument of any reasonable investor.
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:43:01
Seems to me very probable.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:09:08
People cannot issue money themselves, no state will allow it and real currency must be backed by state with its police, army etc. Bitcoin is just virtual speculative asset.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:06:16
Yes, I think it was real intention of creators of this pyramid that sold their virtual coins at the peak.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:42:53
It doesn't mean it's over, these proceedings take lots of time.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:58:14
Everyone will want fiat at the end of this speculative mania as fiat is officially recognized currency supported by state authority. Definitely not ideal, but still better than just virtual mirage.

These fraudsters are not surprisingly warmly welcomed here by "anti-establishment" bitcoiners. But they came late to the party when bubble has alrady popped. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:00:31
You are right, it looks like a bubble that will end very badly for many people. Bitcoin is virtual mirage that is basically useless except for speculation. I doubt there will be another cycle up when this bubble is over because so many people will get burned and so huge amount of money lost that only madman would try to put money into it again. This case will be probably mentioned in economy books as one of worst bubbles ever. But another Ponzi scheme will surely be invented.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:22:44
Be glad he saved you from buying overpriced bitcoin when the bubble is popping. :-D
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:53:10
Do not wait until it is under 8.3k.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:27:25
Cryptocurrencies have been in media of all types everywhere at least since summer. Even dogs and cats are talking about bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:55:58
Bitcoin will not make you free, just a slave of another financial scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:22:23
Be aware that they are overvalued too as the result of current crazy cryptomania.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:22:28
Yes, there is annoying hype just everywhere. You can read about bitcoin even in specialised magazines for plumbers, bee-keepers and gardeners.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:58:39
Bottom is zero.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:12:18
Yes, an idea that bitcoin is valuable because it is unique is a myth. There are many unique things in the world with little value, in fact every pebble is totally unique with no exact copy anywhere else yet its financial value is zero. There are many more dangerous myths about bitcoin - that owner of bitcoin is also owner of part of blockchain technology, that bitcoin is usable as currency replacement on a large scale, that Satoshi is some hidden god with solely good intentions, that bitcoin price can go only up forever, that bitcoin will destroy current financial system and rulers can do nothing against it etc.

"Remember why we're in this space at all: for freedom."
It is not about freedom. This is just another financial scam where few greedy people are enriching themselves on expense of others. Most bitcoins are in few hands and speculators, exchanges and whales are manipulating the price. But worst thing is environmental damage because of senseless mining:
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:10:14
I guess so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:20:21
Coming in just when the bubble is popping is not best idea.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:57:17
If you want real revolution, you have to do it in reality and not in computer game, otherwise nothing will change. But problem is that your generation cannot discern reality from virtual dellusion. Scamers who created cryptobubble and sold it like some alternative are most probably the same banksters you criticize. And they are laughing now.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:15:14
Yes, it is. And fear phase is coming right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:43:04
Anyone who considers using their service should be very careful and read their subreddit first:

Lessons from the crash:  
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:42:21
Tulips at least exist in the real world.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:34:30
You bought just a random numbers. I have number 24678798807807697667889 and I can sell it to you for only 8k. Contact me, it is better deal than 14k, 12k, and 10k. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:19:10
Even more unbacked Tethers?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:16
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:49:36
Some owners of Beanie Babies probably hope that the price will go up again too.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:08:57
And another week from 3800 to zero. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:17:15
This time so many people will get badly burned that I guess it will be different. Even scammers as Tether will hardly help as regulators will be watching closely now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:27:18
Lots of people do not take ordinary warning. Maybe poetry will help. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:32:44
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:11:51
Limit is zero. Bitcoin is just a number and without a Ponzi bubble is worthless. How many people will be willing to pay lots of dollars for example for number 475869079476858599780 except of speculative bubble propped up by scams like another virtual mirage Tether?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:25:09
And they recommend to others holding at any cost.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:15:31
Crash is more appropriate term here than correction.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:40:24
Another Ponzi?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:24:28
Nothing for 14000 is a bargain. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:32:04


There is no guarantee.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:05:18
This crash is the first time when the whole world is watching and I guess valuable lesson will be learned.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:33:31
Why there should be a buying pressure? So many technical problems, scams, bad press and lately also constant downward trend. Plus scams as Tether, which propped up the price, are closely watched now by regulators.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:09:28
Yes. Plus some of people on TV may have also some investment in cryptos so they are not independent.
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:18:39
Anybody can start its own cryptocurrency and there is no guarantee that bitcoin will always prevail.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:21:49
Normal? Only in realm of bubbles.
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:07:45
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:14:27
Yes, price was under $1000 a year ago and will be probably there again in few days or even hours. Huge swing up was driven by greedy speculators, mainly from Asia. These people are so badly burned that they will probably never invest in cryptocurrencies again and few geeks that remain will not be able push it up considerably. Also - nothing to save investors as central banks sometimes do in stock market. You wanted totally free market so you have it, read about the tulip mania. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:34:17
if demand continues...
