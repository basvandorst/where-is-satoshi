Businesses like stability. Bitcoin is volatile at the moment, so using a service which lets them accept Bitcoin but store their value in a more stable currency, is a good mid-point for them.
We should be more patient about Bitcoin uptake and not expect too much too soon. Bitcoin is young.

Is this what costs 200 USD per 50 MiB? Some readers seemed confused that it meant a 50 Mbps connection to your residence.

But the fear is it will put people off by overwhelming them with the complexities involved (not in setting it up, but why your returns are so small might annoy you).

There is a difference between PayPal haters and Facebook/Twitter haters etc.. PayPal haters exist because PayPal screw customers over so hard, mercilessly, offer very little recourse or support given how damaging their actions can be and then there is no humanity to behold for even an apology when they eventually realise their mistake.

Ie, phonetically 'pizza'.

But you don't have to have the whole of the private key to calculate the public one. That's how we can do pooled vanity address generation.

If you are using BTC for transactions, when you buy/mine the BTC to then pay for services and the value of them goes up, so does the cost in BTC to buy... so it all averages out as long as you keep up with dealing in the currency.

Nice idea although this complicates the manufacturing process quite a bit (requires another workpiece positioning).

Pretty much the fact you have to download the entire blockchain. I only run an SSD on my desktop so it's a pain to have such a large amount of data bloating it.

Crashes are good if the price recovers and the coins have truly distributed amongst a larger number of people. But I don't know that we can tell for sure that's what is happening?

You don't need a bank to borrow money, you just need an entity willing to lend you money.

The more of the general public that gets interested in finance, the better. Too many people don't understand how money really works. Kudos to you.

I thought sorting by controversial was supposed to help out in these cases? Or does the balancing of votes skew its position to somewhere elusive?

Well we know that about the defaults, hence my suggestion that this method be used for getting the public key you want without anyone but you having the private key.

That's not really an issue with Bitcoin, it's just somewhat of an issue *right now*. To account for that, a lot of companies are just auto-adjusting their prices in Bitcoin to be in line with a more stable currency such as USD. So when Bitcoin becomes worth more, they ask for less BTC, when it's worth less they ask for more (relative to whichever stable currency they choose). As time goes on, we won't have to do this because BTC will become that stable currency all on its own.

Error detection is not the same as redundancy. It would just tell you that the address was invalid but then it would be useless. But the QR standard error detection wouldn't let it be scanned in the first place anyway.
