Gah, I wish I had more money to invest earlier. I had an extra 100 dollars, bought a bitcoin, made my boyfriend buy one and had a little extra to buy a piece. But being a broke college student and getting into bitcoin is difficult. I even asked to get into my inheritance to double it in size but no dice.
I've quadrupled my money, but didn't invest early enough to make a killing, or enough at a later date to make a killing.
You make me so jealous. :(

Thanks! You're helpful ;)

Definitely true, this is why I'm reluctant. I just have made a lot already and want to have more bitcoin but I am lacking funds. Ill probably just save up and buy another tenth.

Yeah, I mostly wanted to know if it was a bad idea, which since my boyfriend tried to do the same thing at 800 and now its blown up in his face I should know better, which I do, so ill hold.

Yeah, I should probably stay for the ride and do what I can to increase the size of my wallet. Buy tenths here and there... Etc.

It just doesn't make sense that it would be able to maintain this level of growth. It will either stagnate or drop... I love bitcoins and am always telling people about them, I just want to increase the size of my wallet and I'm a broke college student, ive even gotten naked to get more bitcoins and have gotten very little. But ill just save and buy another 10th I guess
