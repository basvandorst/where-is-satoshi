don't buy one, go with any one of their opensource competitors that are better and cheaper.

If you have any questions I can point you in the right direction or I can shamelessly self promote a kickstarter that is launching soon, that I am helping to run.

Here is our site.
it is a fast affordable and scalable delta bot. We have our prototype bots running pretty normally at 200 mm/s. The minis can move quicker but we have a large one that can hit 600mm/s if we specifically tailor the print.
 We are building our real site now and check out system. the kick starter should launch this coming week.

I hope this doesn't give another spike and such. I did like the profit I made I just want a steady currency so I can start using it for, you know, currency.

Whats stopping people from doing that now? Thats a valid form of attack for any resource.
@_date: 2012-05-07 02:51:45
not recently. its bitcoin at 5 right now with usd at 2.

was thinking about these stories about guys posting the code on their company servers. Just wondering how much of a gap it is to drop that on something like google(Imagine the amount of miners you'd have).

assuming it stays at the same absolute value(same amount of hamburgers, gold, and possibly sexual favors it can purchase) shouldn't it rise with inflation?

8 decimal points is a pretty big division.
@_date: 2012-03-22 04:47:47
What you do is you accept cash for bitcoins and charge a small fee and pay in bitcoins so they can bring in their won stuff if they wish but you get money if they use bitcoins. If you sit it around a 5 dollar a coin standard its been sitting on for a bit it may be a nice bit of profit.
@_date: 2012-11-10 03:37:58
that seems the closest to me. not immediate to dollar but pretty damn close.
@_date: 2012-10-14 22:57:27
Why would you do that? That is one of those things you should keep off the cloud in all reasonable sense.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:37:04
Don't you mean PHiat currency?
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:31:54
and it goes down to 8 decimal points.... so you know. Tons of fractions.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:47:01
We do. send an email to me  and we can get talking.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:23:56

@_date: 2013-11-22 18:26:57
yeah, i usually go to ultimachine for my plastic from all the way back in 2009. never heard anything about them and bitcoins. The guy I am working with has met the the protoparadigm people at makerfaire.

sounds like something carlin would of said.
