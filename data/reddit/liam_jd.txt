How absolutely fucked is it hey?!

Nah. I’m 20 and half heartedly put in $20 a month ago at ~$7500AUD, Bitcoin is up around $20,000AUD...
Put some more in dude, it’s gonna be a good time, just gotta send itttttttttttttt.

Yeah same, I’ve only been in the whole bitcoin thing a month or two, buying $20-$50 here and there. But these last few days I’ve been paying more attention and can’t even comprehend what’s going on hahah.

Seeing as this is an Australian story, it feels only right to call these guys a bunch of shit cunts.

Coinbase doesn’t allow Australian’s the ability to sell is my main problem. I bought bitcoin here and there all the way up to its peak in December, obviously lost a bit but I’m back in front as it sits now. Was planning on transferring to Coinjar to sell and buy back in a better price and try again.
Got any pointers for me?
