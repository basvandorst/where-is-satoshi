you are right. I NEVER saw anyone predicting anything right on Tradingview. Just lines and triangles and it did just do the complete oposite of what they were predicting. magicpoop canon is the leader of it xD

 A **bear trap** denotes a technical pattern that occurs when the performance of a stock, index or other financial instrument incorrectly signals a reversal of a rising price trend.

your right for bitcoin and xrp litecoin etc. but there are so many coins i cant put on my ledger thats just bad.
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:51:21
funny how ppl keep posting negativ stuff on the front page after the 4th price drop over 75%. Followed by 1000x gains. you may be wrong and will be posting the same thing after the 5th drop.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:26:34
i know i love hearing Bcash\_betrash bashing roger and his scamcoin. but im asking myself why he is so mad about it. thats all
@_date: 2018-12-23 12:50:03
was the first thing i was thinking about xD best post
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:11:32
im wondering for weeks why you are so obsessed with bashing bcash. im defintely not pro bcash just to know why you are so sad. i know its a shitcoin and roger should throw himself out of a car at 120mph on a freeway. but why are you so mad. focus just on bitcoin leave him behind :) cheers
