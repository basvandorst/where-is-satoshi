While I see your logic, the other hand of the argument is, if you get pulled over with 10k cash and no legitimate reason/proof as to why you have that amount on you, they will take it and keep it until you prove where you got it from and why you needed to have that amount of cash.

It is dropping because the big money that keeps the buying selling cycle of inflation/deflation are on the sell cycle, it will stay on this cycle until they decide to pull funds and invest in something else.

I am simple, does old mate mean that today's currency will be null and void and bitcoin will be considered "today's currency" in the future?

You need to verify your identity before you can purchase bitcoin from most wallets. With a drivers licence or passport, such BS.
