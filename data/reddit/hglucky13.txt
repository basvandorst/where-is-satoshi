I'm still completely new, this is all speculation. The concept of growing slowly over the course of many years was a statement I made looking at Bitcoin's value from a wide perspective (year open and close values). If I'm completely off base, then I apologize. I'm happy to be corrected and have more accurate information. All I ask is don't be a jerk with your reply :)

I always just assume I'm late to everything. Glad I could make you laugh, but sorry it made your ass fall off. :(

I think when considering the big picture, continued corrections/dips all the way down to $3-4k wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility for me. I would be more likely to see it as a massive adjustment to correct for the huge influx of investments from the Late Majority and Laggards (see [Diffusion of Innovations]( that began in late 2017. 
Bitcoin has been allowed to grow slowly and steadily over the course of nearly a decade. Only in the last 6 months has it started getting any real mainstream attention which is causing all this volatility. Even in 2017, It took 6 months for BTC to rise from ~$1000 up to ~$2500, and it was still only hanging around ~$5-6k by the beginning of November as the Early Majority started becoming more interested.
The massive spike really only occurred after the news broke the it had breached $10k. This is when a lot of people bought in (myself included). But, not understanding the Tech (and I'm still trying to wrap my brain around it), it's easy to shake newbies up because many were hoping to get rich overnight with no real work or research.
The fact of the matter is that when people follow the cardinal rule of "don't invest any more than you are willing to lose," it becomes a non-issue on whether Bitcoin is dying, or not. That being said, so many people have put in so much effort into building and maintaining the blockchain, that while I think it's quite possible we could continue to see a bearish market for a while, Bitcoin isn't going away for a long time.
*Sorry for such a long post. I got going and couldn't stop. I know people still have valid reservations and take issue with aspects of Bitcoin, so I'm trying to learn about that stuff, too.*

Right there with you. At some point way in the future (assuming it's up enough), I'll probably pull my initial measly investment amount so I can say that I didn't lose anything, but after that, I don't expect to touch it for years.

Just remember why you bought it, and keep on hodlin,
Cause you don't wanna be selling at a loss.

Same here. I was actually able to pull my initial USD investment so everything I have in it at this point is alt coin that I made blogging on Steemit. So it all feels like monopoly money to me at this point.

I thought this was a clip from a Trials games for a second...

I worry he may end up with a serious neck injury. When they kept slowing it in slow motion, and his head just snapped to the side... Well, I'll just say I was super happy to hear he was able to walk of the field.

I don't understand how this isn't the top comment...

I don't think I've ever heard anyone here suggest anything of the sort. In fact, most people I have seen on this thread are huge proponents of investing responsibly. I'd be curious to see some links to validate your point (not that I don't think they exist, but anyone suggesting to take out a loan to buy crypto needs to be downvoted to oblivion).
