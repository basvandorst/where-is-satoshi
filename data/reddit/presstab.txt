I do claim to be an expert in Proof of Stake, which is why I am trying to drill down on what exactly you mean. 
ETH was a hard fork, ie every use had to update their wallet in order to roll back the transactions. You are proposing that you can search the chain, and reassign ownership from one address to another by doing something that has something to do with history.
I guess i just do not follow.
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:34:42
Proof of Stake is a proof system, not a transaction fee system. Transaction fees and supply growth could be set to 0, and yet it could still have proof of stake.

Borrowers and lenders are not the same thing. Having credit risk and being a ponzi are two extremely different things.  I think people that don't like banks just hear the word ponzi and know it is a bad thing and so they call banks ponzis.

I work in finance, I have a degree in economics. Minsky is not some type of economics god, he is just an economist, some of his stuff is good, some bad. And besides the point you aren't even translating his economics right.  You think that because Minsky says that *certain* borrowers are *ponzi borrowers* that means that the banking system is a ponzi scheme. Minsky doesn't say that.  At least from the reading I have done.
If you wouldn't mind pointing me to precisely where Minsky claims FRB is a ponzi then that would be helpful.

Read about ponzi schemes. FRB is not ponzi.  Ponzi's need more and more investor money to flow into the fund in order to pay returns to existing investors. Banks do not need increasing deposits in order to pay interest on their demand deposits, they use the interest earned on their securities to pay interest on their demand deposits. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:29:29
I think Minsky's Ponzi borrowers is referring to borrowers not the the banks as having Ponzi like features.

You shouldn't be stupified. The Fed controls monetary policy and has regulatory oversight over banks.  They have much less regulatory oversight over banks and especially shadow banks than they want. The Fed can't get the oversight they want over banks, so why would they be able to somehow gain oversight over a commodity that has nothing to do with banks?  They could perhaps tell banks that they cannot take bitcoin deposits.

I am guessing that exchanges will be required to produce the proper tax documents, but that is just a guess. I am no expert with IRS requirements. 
I don't know if exchanges like Cryptsy keep history longer than a few months too.  So this could get difficult real fast.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:31:36
The comparison you are making doesn't make much sense. You are essentially that banking is a ponzi scheme. It doesn't matter the medium of currency you would use for banking, it could be bitcoin as well. 
Banks make money by lending.  They of course can't keep 100% reserves because then they would not be capable of lending at all. If lending is removed from the banking sector then banks wouldn't be making money, and therefore would have no reason to be banks in the first place - unless instead of giving out interest, they required depositors to pay fees in order to safely store the money in 100% reserve.
This dilemma occurs whether a bank holds USD, EUR, GBP, or BTC.  The currency is not what should be compared, it is the banking system.

Funny enough, I just finished up a c++ bip38 encrypt/decrypt tool for an altcoin qt wallet.
For bip38 the salt is a double sha256 hash of the address. So its not really random. The protection of bip38 really lies in the scrypt hash, which uses much more intensive parameters in this instance of scrypt than the scrypt hashing in say litecoin or other cryptocurrencies.

If you are talking about daily swings, then sure. Longer term trends do have causation though, and for me, I am very interested in knowing what causes long term price trends with bitcoin. Is it more circumventing national currencies in China and India? Is it more of the current whales collecting more coins? Is adoption picking up? This is important to me.
But if you are just playing a gambling game and looking at the ticker every 5 seconds and posting roller coster gifs, then yes your point is somewhat valid.

Adding a hard coded checkpoint of a recent blockhash into each wallet's release completely removes this issue. It is really a non-issue that comes up over and over. If there was "no cost" then this attack would be launched everyday against dozens of currencies... but that isn't happening because its not even a real attack for most coins.

Unless I am mistaken, bitcoin consensus (PoW) is practically bottlenecked by the handful of companies that produce mining hardware.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:55:48
Sure you aren't "forbidden" from buying from the couple of mining hardware companies, but you do have to buy from those companies if you want equipment that isn't outdated. And if you do want to buy new mining equipment it is a huge pain in the ass. 
And not only that, but these mining equipment manufacturers are also your direct competition. Bitmain owns one of the largest bitcoin mining operations in the world iirc.

@_date: 2017-08-21 12:04:22


That only could theoretically work for a long range attack. Most of the more up-to-date PoS coins have a max reorg limit that won't let giant reorgs occur. 
There are also checkpoints hard coded into wallets. The majority of coins only have a very small window where someone would have 50%+ ownership of the coin (maybe an ico with a distribution phase or similar). After coins are spread out among many users, add a checkpoint and that completely solves the whole "buy old keys" problem.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:57:43
Proof of Work is great in a lot of aspects. What is not great is the centralization of mining equipment manufacturing, as well as operation of the equipment.
For most altcoins, PoW is much easier to attack than PoS, because many of them get such a small amount of hash power to begin with, its not all that hard to have a multipool switch to its chain and take over. 
PoS requires that you buy your mining equipment (coins) from the actual owners/users of the network. There is not the same mine and dump mentality, well at least not to the same extent. 
Other than the economics of it, the consensus algorithm really does work pretty well and there aren't many problems on most PoS chains (even though ever other person on here will make claims about theoretical attacks that have never occured and somehow prove PoS is not safe).
I could get into any specific technical details of PoS if you wanted to, but not necessary to do so in this specific reply.

I don't have a lot of experience with ethereum specific consensus rules, but I suppose the distinction you are drawing is that although the majority of hashing power in ethereum's fork did switch to a reorg'd chain, the problem is that non-upgraded software *did not* automatically recognize the chain reorganization. 
Whereas when the value overflow incident occurred in bitcoin, non-upgraded software *did* recognize the reorganization and were able to keep up with consensus. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:01:20
Bitcoin was rescued by miners who ran code with new validation rules concerning *value overflow*, which rolled the chain back something like 1/2 days worth of blocks. Is that correct?

I'm sorry I don't think you understand much about banking economics and your unfamiliarity with one of the fundamental banking terms sort of solidifies that.
4.25% nominal fixed interest rate on a 30 year loan with current inflation around 2% is not usurious.  That is a current real interest rate of 2.25%, and inflation is expected to increase over the next 30 years - probably to more like 3.5%.  The bank takes all of the inflation risk with a fixed rate loan that most mortgages typically have.
But whatever, you are anti-interest or something cool like that, so no point in continuing dialogue.

Deflation really is not good for currency. That is why I view cryptocurrencies as more of a hybrid between an investment and currency rather than full blown currency. I definitely think there is room for alternate currencies that are deflationary, just whether or not the most predominant currency can be deflationary is the question.  For example during the GD:


mortgage with the bank and that mortgage requires, say, a fixed payment of $20 dollars each 
month, that amount of money you have to pay is fixed. But how do you pay that, you pay it by 
growing your crops and selling the crops in market. Now if you have a deflation going on, that 
means that the prices of your corn or your cotton, or your grain is falling over time, but your 
payment to the bank stays the same. So a deflation created a grinding pressure on farmers as they 
saw the prices of their products going down, and as their debt payments remained unchanged. 
And so, farmers were squeezed by this decline in their crop prices, and they recognized that this 
deflation was not an accident. The deflation was being caused by the gold standard.

It is a financial and economic term - The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus inflation. It is what actually matters when talking about loans - what are you the lender really making after adjusting inflation?
