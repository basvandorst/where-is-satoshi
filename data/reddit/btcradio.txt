I guess this is close as we get to a circle jerk?
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:29:23
I'm thinking specific niche coins lol 
@_date: 2014-08-09 02:18:26
Can someone explain this like I'm ~~5~~ 2. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:40:50
Turned out they used the funds for there wedding and honeymoon.
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:57:41
Can check out some Bitcoin Crowdfunding projects [here]( ...
@_date: 2014-05-27 23:12:55
You should look into some Bitcoin Crowdfunding ;-)
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:10:50
Do you really think they are kids ? interesting take. I wonder that the ratio is vs. kids to adults. This is why it would be interesting to do a write-up the profile of a Bitcoin scammer.
@_date: 2014-08-29 21:57:34
TO the Moon!
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:07:13
Let's make this happen over here!
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:52:14
I just thought it was funny lol
@_date: 2014-09-03 01:24:32
They always said the ones who made money during the gold rush where the ones selling the shovels......
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:05:27
You don't see this over at dogecoin!!! 
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:06:47
Haha ...actually, I should have added I have.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:57:21


Think about it  the Child Molester Fund of America wants to get a bunch of bitcoins , yet its pretty well known ( like this silk road stuff ) that a child molestor was jailed and his/her 5,000 BTC is being auctioned off would they want the press to know they might have gotten 1 BTC from that 5,000 ? No.  From a pure PR perspective there are MANY companies that don't want anything to do with Bitcoin because of such things.  Why, not have two place for two different type of groups ?  If whitelisted coins are so extreme of an ideology the price will reflect it , right ?   Non- white listed coins $600  , white listed coins $900  no harm done.  Yes, I would if I'm a reputable company. I would pay of a premium to not be associated with coins that would damage my reputation. It would be a no brainer.
@_date: 2014-08-30 02:27:04
@_date: 2014-09-06 02:58:38
Been waiting for an article like this. It is really true and there has to be a hard reflection as to the real uses of Bitcoin 2.0 type applications.
@_date: 2014-10-16 03:41:39
Sounds like something Karples would do. Oh wait he tried the same thing!
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:31:33
Umm you stole the idea from BitcoinNakedNews.com or ?
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:59:24
Who wants to bet 65 % of people didn't want to own a P.C  :)
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:58:37
It's going to happen anyways. Why not let everyone be transparent about it so we know who not to go to and who to go to ?
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:57:17
Coinbase has rejected me before I have a strange feeling they just do this all for fun.
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:28:15


What [Bitcoin Crowdfunding]( ?
@_date: 2014-09-11 16:58:20
@_date: 2014-09-01 02:15:05
Try it again.... seems to be back now here.
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:50:14
This is hilarious.
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:14:36
@_date: 2014-09-14 00:29:29
A whole lot of shit
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:48:03
Kickstarter ?
Why not  ?
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:35:20
This is why local bitcoins doesn't work . I never got why people would use this service.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:48:10
Umm the choice is also going to an exchange who accepts only whitelisted coins also? You are assuming that nobody will know who accepts what and in that assumption there is some "big surprise" upon finding out.  My point is there should be one track for people who want to stay clean, and another for people who don't care. That shouldn't be to difficult. If a company doesn't care what track their customers wants to take with their service then so be it, but if another company only accepts whitelisted/clean coins  and you don't like that then you take your business elsewhere , yes?
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:41:56
I don't own the company. I've used it off and on over the years. There fee's go up and down, but currently it seems its 20 % fee currently. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 05:17:46
Time for theymos to step down. He is a scammer of the highest degree.
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:55:46
She a buttcoiner?
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:07:31
Oh I agree if you can buy stuff with BTC more power to you!  
@_date: 2014-09-02 22:53:42
This looks mighty good!
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:03:23
Right, but not all alt-coins were push button types. Some actually took some thinking right ?
@_date: 2014-09-27 18:56:22
Mark Karples is in the other sign next to it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:16:34
So the knowledge base was there and anyone from day-one could build their own coin right  the week after Bitcoin launched ? Just wasn't profitable or thought of at the moment ....
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:38:39
He hired Mark Karples.
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:52:44
why would anyone use BitStamp ? just the name is gay as hell. Now You've BEEN BITSTAMP'd! 
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:32:50
assholes have two directions?
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:14:17
Martyr ?
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:18:38
If you asked Coke A Cola if they would rather transact in clean dollar bills I can tell you right now they would. Or at least dollars bills that haven't pass through Al Quida's hands.
@_date: 2014-10-18 22:25:47
I didn't no. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:24:44
Yes, the fee is $10 in that case - you then can push the funds to any Paypal Account or CC for you to purchase the item of your choosing all this is done via email.  I've heard of Coinbase yes ?
@_date: 2014-10-16 04:22:44
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:06:06
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:46:06
*slow claps*
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:13:40
use [BTCinstant.com]( ...enables you to "push" alt-coins to cash to any CC or paypal account. Easy peasy.
@_date: 2014-08-02 01:40:06
whelp so much for that!
@_date: 2014-08-30 00:21:14
The guy is a mental monkey - just a few brain cells short of Max Kieser!
@_date: 2014-05-28 00:53:09
I'll check it out as I hadn't yet! Thanks for the link also. I'll report back!
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:33:39
How would we know if they wouldn't ? never been given an option to. 
I'm not sure that is entirely true, about fungibility being the most important part of the currency.  If there were two sets of clean dollars vs. tainted dollars early on everything would be going smoothly on two tracks - the criminal underworld and legit companies. You can't take out fungibility to the dollar this late in the game, but you could for a digital currency. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:09:28
I highly recommend [BTCinstant.com](  the oldest virtual gift-card company ( fee is a little high ) but you pay for reliability.
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:02:19
Gov't doesn't have control of the world.  I'm not sure I understand when you say prevent money transfers you talking about fiat?  I'm saying if an exchange wants to do only whitelisted coins so be it , but if an exchange doesn't then move right along like business as usual. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 11:24:59
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:06:03


I hear what your saying. I'm not sure why you say everyone needs to run coinvalidation software ? If a service is still set-up to accept only non-whitelisted coins and doesn't care why would they need to do that. Just curious ?
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:25:23
....And yes you can play in these markets safely accordingly to [huffington post]( ....
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:06:39
I guess that is the keyword right ?
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:50:09
Looks like purse doesn't follow through either.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:30:31
Good point. Is that BitPagos ?
@_date: 2015-11-26 04:50:59
Ugghh this sucks! lol
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:11:10
Hi! check out this is what it was designed for! 
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:39:10
Thanks for this!
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:03:11

@_date: 2015-03-10 06:09:46
Yay! cool. Yeah, figured you needed to let people get you some rep :) and thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:13:35
Thanks bud!
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:09:28
check out also ;)
some bit giving lovers there!
No need for bits here :)
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:39:02
Cool stuff!  I'm currently trying to get a band up on People unlock content via tipping right on Reddit. If you have some new stuff it would be cool to try it out . If you have a following you could tell them to tip to hear more snippets of stuff , or get special updates. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:05:23
True,true when you become a huge author make sure you come back lol xD
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:56:48
1 day left! 
edit: will that escalated quickly! thank you whomever ( if multiple people) just pledged!
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:56:32
Just did thanks!
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:34:17
Anon ads is a good company I know them personally.
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:52:47
you looking to rob it?
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:18:29
199 weeks LOL
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:36:14
bucktee's is cool going to head over there soon!
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:44:18
Yes, the idea would be to "pool" the BTC tips throughout the day given and distribute it to the artists. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:36:27
HAHA wow :)
@_date: 2013-09-22 03:12:09
Usually, when you add to something to the conversation its when people agree with it.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:34:25
Thanks! I just saw your post haha  24 hour station would just run general music + segments etc., etc., maybe we can team up or something.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:37:56
I am Satoshi.
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:04:54
Really? The point is the homeless are getting clothes who cares what is on it. Would you rather have Nike ?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:42:26
reverse cowgirl!
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:55:42
Yes, their filters are sound I've had no problems with NSFW ads.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:16:53
All debt.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:38:35
Cooooooool I'll reach out to you soon. I love what you are doing also keep it up! :)
@_date: 2013-09-15 20:02:50
lol ^^
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:13:51
I heard they are a scam now. Some other guy was saying he was ripped off :/
@_date: 2013-08-21 01:57:21
Good video!
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:27:16


I think it's fine to let people know who/what got these homeless people their clothing. I mean if it wasn't for Bitcoin there would be no Hoodies for the homeless. I see nothing crass about it really. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:42:56
I have $933 but I'm using an avg.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:30:03
Yes, figured during down-time it could just play Bitcoiners music they load up .
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:20:43
Don't forget  !
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:15:36
Maybe, I am ;)
