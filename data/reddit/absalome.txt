Kenny doesn't die anymore... at the end he should have some BTC on his phone and we see it... since he mined it and HODLs it, his family isn't *technically* poor... but is because he hodling, with the last shot of Kenny looking up to the moon.  Then credits.  A good story about how Kenny can drag his family out of poverty, but none of the friends know, and the audience is happy that something is going right for Kenny, for once.

Peter Thiel attended the 'Deploraball'.  Its not slander to say that he is what is wrong with the world.  I don't care if he is deep in BTC, he is human trash.

They need to train you better back in St. Pete's.  Get some thicker skin, and come back with something better than name calling.  For me to be upset by anything you say, I'd have to value your opinion.  That's what you can't seem to fathom.
