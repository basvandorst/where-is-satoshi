Thanks man. I agree not to trust anyone, and btw I did just lose it all. I definitely learned my lesson, but leveraged hodling is still a great thing for me.

Nah I just ran out of equity. I just sat there while my last dollar disappeared from my account. Quite hard on the emotions, for sure. I'm buying this dip now

At least you got a good meme out of it

Man you are a lucky charm. I just bought 7 bitcoin at 7845! And that's just because I happened to wake up in the middle of the night (the dip was at 4am here in europe). Let's hope you get your gains too, kind sir.

You got it! Bitcoiners generally do not think that money creation by banks is a good thing. They think that it causes inflation, and indirectly taxes all who use the currency. But hey, if you disagree that's fine, you don't have to use bitcoin.

This is not true. The fundamental business model of a bank is franctional reserve lending. This means loaning out more money than they have, about 15x. Thereby they create money. This cannot be done and is the reason why bitcoin was invented.
