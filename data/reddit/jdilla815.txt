What Henry Ford definitely did write in his 1922 book [My Like and Work]( at page 179 is:


In summary, it seems that a paraphrasing of Henry Ford has been mistakenly identified as an exact quote.

Why people are so negative in the comment section damn that is incredifkingble?? ?  
What are they even doing in a Bitcoin sub if they don't like the Open Protocol or btc???   
It's open, it's fking MADE so that it's voluntary... that is the core principal...  
Anyone can leave or just not use the technology at all if they don't want to, but again, what are they doing crying on a BTC sub on reddit

Where do you find this ''second layer'' blockchain info? does people need to upload the info of their own LN node themselves on the site or did you found the info somewhere?

the money is programmable. Even tho now u cant, give it 2 years and all those concept you thought were an ''obligation'' with BTC like revealing everything etc.... those are just wallets/LN innovations waiting to happen. BTC is totaly programmable man, when every ''coffee shop'' will use in the future some fancy second layer LN Private-included Node, u wont think about that old concept of always revealing where a transact comes from when paying merchants or things.

Exactly what I thought, opinions are so diverse on the thread.   
I really enjoy reading what random people says about BTC!   
It helps me seeing how we are still clearly in the ''early lunatics phase'' haha and that no one really think about Bitcoin as a technology, which is saddest thing about this... because they themselves are on Facebook/Youtube/Netflix/Mobile Banking/Gmail... why can't they picture the value behind this? because those companies are more huge ''AI-for-consumerism'' ''marketing'' corporations than anything remotely/closely related to tech.
They saw the complete infrastructure inversion and disruptive technologies get all those really nice things built ''on top of it'', but it's harder to make people realize the impact of those tech on consumer protection, and facilitation with programmation of economic exchanges/relations between individuals locally/globally. Most people don't really care anyway about any of their personal info/privacy so I would not bet on that to make people see why Cryptos are a necessity and all and the importance of FIAT &amp; Crypto coexistence.
Some people see BTC as what it is, a recipe and a base, flat, decentralized protocol.The web/TCP/IP did wonders for content distribution &amp; many many other applications. It's very easy to picture with that in mind why Bitcoin/Cryptos will effectively &amp; constantly bring more &amp; more financial inclusion.
I mean damn, even Corn nowadays is a platform in itself, a technology.  Corn is a rich source of infinitely-flexible polysaccharide starch. The same thing with rice. Corn is dominant because of pricing not because it’s a single tentpole.   
(You are slowly realizing it has literally been years, maybe decades, since you ate any meal made without corn. It's used in EVERYTHING and is in EVERY product. And no not because of some ''GMO conspiracy'' crap or whatever, but because it is a technology, a platform. Eat at any fast food or dine-in restaurant chain and avoiding corn becomes impossible.  When broken down, derivatives of corn get used as a food filler, texturiser, emulsifier, sweetener, preservative, adhesive and many other applications. 
I think the big problem is that like always, price dominates the conversation. Media wants clicks to sell their ads. People LOVE talking or speculating about PRICE all the time. It's the first thing that comes in mind, after all the ''terrorists are using Bitcoin today'', exchanges &amp; wallet ''hacking'', robbery, ransomware &amp; other things they consider very scary complicated and weird geek/nerd stuff.
Of course, for most people in developed country, Bitcoin is not ready for them. It is for of billions of people that have worst, bad or no access to financial services. Why would most people in developed country use BTC today, if hes not ''investing'' or using it to escape a little everyday digitally out of the global banking cartel by mining a little or earning BTC on a daily basis or simply buy with FIAT a small amounts everyday?
The tech will evolve so much in the next 10-20 years and when they are going to use it, probably when they won't even know it (like most people don't know banks use HyperLedger/R3)
People that have no idea about the nature of the financial system that they live in right now can't understand or picture in their head why Cryptos are important to 2/3 of the Earth (and the rest too yes)The problem is that it's kinda like trying to explain Wikipedia or Facebook on paper, he might look at you weird and say ''that shit won't work man'' (also depending on if you ask them in 1990,2000,2010 or if hes 20,30,70 or 80 years old and knows about the fact internet is not like 25 years ago haha)
Some average Reddit users really sees this as a pyramid scheme (but not their own Fiat $ cause they don't see the global daily currency war &amp; the real on-going massive scale corruption of the banking cartel &amp; secrecy advantage that Fiat has) but that's simply normal
Some sees this as 120% ''gambling nerd money'', some of them have with small, medium or no amount at all
Some sees this as a way to make money (the reason why I first joined mining in 2016) but stayed when they realized how deep it was.Some really think ''miners'' or large holders get ''all the profits all the time'' and think those people are taking ''no risk at all'' having stacks &amp; stacks of coins/miners instead of FIAT?
And of course some have some have a funny conspiracy theories about it profiting only 1 or 2 guys like ''Satoshi'' himself and totally controlled by the Chinese Gov.
I love Reddit haha.

people don't know about sub-satoshi??? With LN today you can pay sub-satoshi fees, it's not like its a new thing.

Cryptos have mathematics rules, and are regulated by algorithms : global rules and consensus without rulers.   
Gemini is a CENTRALIZED exchange, and this is why they need all those ridiculous ineffective and counter-intuitive/exclusive KYC/AML practices &amp; regulations ; and this is dangerous to apply over a decentralized environment.   
This is why you should keep your own private key on a hardware wallet.  
Keeping open blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI/platforms and the internet decentralized and open is a priority.  
There's no infrastructure inversion and extreme innovation from the edge in centralized environnement. It is business as usual.  
Be about what you believe in and the massive power of positivism, freedom and empowerment of individuals.   
Not about regulating centralized exchanges the loss/win of gambling investments and a couple more people get Lambos. That's not the future.

Exactly, money is langugage, cryptos (the open, decentralized one) are democratic language on steroids. Not one is better, they are just different and will evolve to have their own use case because of limitations in other Network Protocols.

Trezor is open source, so more recommandable for keeping open source currencies safe...

Flat system based on consensus of rules without rulers- The choice of  being able to use it, others, or not, or both them and your national currency, in my mind having the choice to do those things inside a smartphone/pc/tablet is more the ''punk'' aspect of it.- Different networks protocols based on that recipe have emerged as we seen in the past year, a lot of crap almost 99%, the fact that anyone can create crap or extremely good internet platform, the fact that a fairly talented 14 year old can create their own global unstoppable system or mix them with current one or just build on top... even forking constantly with a generator online in a clic...- The fact you don't need permission and prior authorization to really use most aspect of the system in most case is really kinda the ''punk/anarchic'' aspect of BTC. Its a ''DEAL WITH IT'' ''We forgot to ask for permission'' idea, and I mean is anarchy really having no system? since its a system in itself what is anarchy? and why would anarchy not let me create small ''inner-system'' since there are no one to say what you can/cant do and people could opt in and out whenever they can... on paper BTC Protocol dosent work. It is because of its decentralized open permission-less punk nature that it works today and been working as the users of the network wants it to work. It's like common sense about and popular belief about new technologies before the infrastructure : not everyone have it do it but it grows with time even if half the people were ''against'' and criticizing automobiles / computer / cellphone / internet
