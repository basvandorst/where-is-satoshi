No, what I meant was if it was a mining operation, and it had payouts to 50+ sub-miners, wouldn't it just pay those out in one transaction, instead of the cascading payment trail of a payment to 1 address, that pays the next, that pays the next...
So instead of me paying 50 addresses at once, I have to play the [telephone game]( and pay one address and then that address has to pay the next one, and so on.

When I was in [Uganda this summer]( one of the things that came up a few times was bringing the ability to micro-bank to the villages where we were building wells. This was multi-purpose: 
* create a savings account for any future well hardware expenses
* create actual deposit accounts for the villagers so they could become *banked*
* ...other things
Almost everyone has a phone, even if they don't have power. At least one person in the village will have a generator and people will bring their phones to him to charge at night.
Many people travel long distances to sell excess food and wares (most were just slightly above subsistence farmers). They would get up very early and start walking, sometimes not getting to where they were going until the next day, selling at the market, then returning home, and then repeating the whole thing again the next week. Not having to travel with the cash made at those markets would certainly be a boon to safety.
The official language is English, and while they may not speak it as clearly as a European or American, they can understand an speak it just fine.
One final thing: most of the people we met had/have village elders, something from the past that remains today. Most of the important decisions for the people of the village go to and through the elders. If you can get the basic concepts of this to those folks, you'll get it to the entire rest of the village.
**Edit to add:** Oh yeah! Most of the huts/buildings were painted by companies using the structure as advertising and it sure seemed like it was split 
* 33% painting company
* 33% Vodaphone
* *33% money transfer company*
Proportionally, the advertising on money-transfer services appears to be much, much bigger over there.

Am I wrong in seeing this as a breakdown of, fault of, and responsibility of the data center, entirely?
If the company I work for uses client invoice records, but stores them at a 3rd party data warehouse, and that warehouse doesn't follow their own security measures and those records get accessed, is that *my* fault or the people running the warehouse? In my contract with them, if it says (in effect) "You will protect my shit and make sure no unauthorized access happens" and then they allow unauthorized access, that's on them, and they would be responsible for the consequences, monetarily and/or other compensation for damages.

We're not a startup, per se, but with 6 Dev and 1 QA, the company I work for has a very small IT shop. That said, we've done same-day hotfixes for critical issues (usually involving visibility of customer invoice data or ability to access our site).
If it's truly important, it gets done. Thing is, you don't know what their other priorities are, and frequently, the things that delays bug fixes are:
1) more critical bug fixes
2) higher priority key enhancements/features
3) straight-up inability to find and fix the bug

BTC/$ ratios were much higher at the time, so it's not like people were thinking "Whoa, this guy's sitting on $40 million in bitcoin!" instead it was more like $3 million.

It's weird, there are a number (most) of addresses that show [multiple]( payments to the hack address.
The one linked there has a transaction at **2015-01-04 13:00:52** and another at **2015-01-04 13:14:58**, and there are many more with similar multi-payouts.

There are a few reasons, that I've seen, not to slide all the way to 50%:
* increased delay to fill time- when I've looked, it typically says ~48 hours to fill up to 25%, 72 hours up to 35%, and then 4+ days above that (meaning pack a lunch, it's going to be a while).
* the Purse fee goes up the higher you move the discount, to the point where the increased discount is largely offset and the actual realized cost to you changes minimally.
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:53:07
You are right, in that it is misleading: you cant brute force a *specific* address, but you could stumble across an address with a balance, which is really the thing that matters.
Specific address = no
Any address that might be loaded = possible

Absolutely, but it's just one of those statistical things that always bugs me when I see these discussions of probability, that they always focus (without really saying it) on trying to determine one specific address, and leave out the fact that to be successful, *any* address match is a win.

@_date: 2016-02-24 04:55:45
I probably should, but I always transfer out of Coinbase immediately to either paper or a portable app that doesn't track/care where I spend things, so CB couldn't rebuy since they have no knowledge of the transaction. 
That said, I should just manually do it myself.
@_date: 2016-02-23 21:05:05
I *had* saved 30-40% on a bunch of stuff, but that was back when BTC was lower. 
For example, I got my running shoes Oct 3, 2015 for ~$84 versus @ $120 and BTC was $237, so now...well, I spent quite a bit more on my running shoes than I intended (~$140 now).
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:39:13
I get that, but here's my take on it: trial and error empower the user--&gt; You slide it all the way up to 50% and completely ignore the actual impact to final cost or change in probable order fill time, and then log in day after day trying to figure out why no one has given you the SUPERDDUPERDEAZ! 
If you can't be bothered to pay attention to even a few of the details, too bad for you. While it should be easy to use, dumbing everything down to the lowest common denominator makes things crap for everyone else.

Over 500 hops, how can you say with any certainty that it's the same user? I'm actually curious how you can tell that the BTC I might send from an exchange account to 5 different paperwallets, and then from one of those to Mycelium and from another of those to Electrum...how do you know that the paper wallets are mine, or that the Myc or Elec wallets are mine? 
What tells you those are mine versus them being someone with whom I've transacted or bought from?
@_date: 2015-04-06 12:20:31
Neither here nor there, but they need to learn how to parse exchange rates, because I'm pretty sure they've got this backwards:

I've got to agree with this. I'd never heard of ytcracker, and that is one catchy, nerdy tune.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:48:00
 Couldn't you simply send it to a number of paper wallets and then to multiple Mycelium  addresses then to Electrum wallets?
Is there a reason you have to involve exchanges at all, versus farming out among your own addresses?

There is no "early in the timer," the timer resets after *every* donation. It seems like people keep thinking that after person A donates, the timer runs until their donation period ends instead of running until person B donates, which then restarts the timer immediately for person B's duration.
There is no last-minute sniping of the timer, since the instant someone donates, the timer fully resets and even if it was 0.001 seconds from done, it's now at 1-14 minutes.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:34:03
And some people have multiple accounts:
* Savings account
* Checking account
* Health spending account
I have more in my checking than savings, since both earn interest so it doesn't really matter where the money sits...unless I'm paying bills, which comes from checking. If I cleared my savings to buy ~35BTC, bills would still get paid and insurance expenses are still covered.

On the one hand- old news about a significant and well known payment system integrating BTC is good.

They can follow funds to some extent, but really, once  they are sent from Coinbase to another address...anything after that could be the actions of someone else.
1) buy on CB
2) sell locally or buy some item and xfer BTC to an address
3) there is no 3, those are no longer my BTC and following them from this point on has nothing to do with me.

I'm not talking about tainted coins, I'm talking about the ability to follow *any* coins. The only address CB or anyone knows for certain "belongs" to me is the first one. Once they are sent to another address, that could belong to anyone, anywhere, the ability to know who is in control of the BTC ends.
Coins known to be tainted, stolen, or whatever... that's a different discussion. All I'm getting at is that there is no way to know whether the control of coins is mine or someone elses once they have moved off an exchange (unless you disclose ownership/control of an address, obviously.)
