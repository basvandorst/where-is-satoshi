Might I recommend switching to GDAX?  It's owned by the same company as Coinbase and you can move your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX for free/instantly I believe.
I am in a similar boat, with real world stuff that would be nice to know you have covered from the BTC gains.   I also don't want to miss out on any price rise.
The advantage of GDAX here is that it functions more like a real exchange.   You can set a limit order on your coins, so if the price falls to a certain point you set it will sell.  So you just periodically adjust that number as the market rises and you can (mostly) lock in your gains.   Those orders execute automatically, so you can be asleep or not able to log in and they generally go through fine.
One caveat there is that... Many people are starting to do this, and if you say to sell 10 BTC at 15,000 there could be 1,000 other people who do that... So it will fill at the current price depending on how you set it up.   So you need to factor that into the thought process of setting up your limit... But it could be a great way to make sure you can keep participating in the upside without putting it all at risk, too.

That's only true if you bought them.  If you mined them you owe taxes based on the value they carried the day they were mined.

I believe a 1031 requires a like kind exchange.

You are already likely past due on taxes from mining.  My tax firm looked at this for me, and when you are mining you need to pay some tax at the time you mined the coin.   If 1 bitcoin was worth $100 when you mined it, that is taxed as ordinary income at the time you mined it because you took possession of the asset.  From that point if you have held the coins for more than a year it is a capital gain, so if 1 bitcoin was worth $200 when you sold you are only taxed on the $100 in gains.   Coins are taxed on a FIFO basis.
So, yeah, get a good tax guy.
"Q-8: Does a taxpayer who “mines” virtual currency (for example, uses computer
resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin
transaction ledger) realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency
resulting from those activities?
A-8: Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value
of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See
Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable

Let's get real - only the rich can really afford to mine BTC profitably already.

Tell that to the thousands of people who used to work for the Yellow Pages or curating Web indexes by hand.   ;)

Banner Bank, West coast United States.  They made it sound like it is a new federal requirement not just their bank policy.

I’m not using them for anything crypto related.  I have a credit union that is supportive of crypto and that’s what I use.   Just found it interesting and thought I would share.

This is a good observation.   I feel like the nature of requiring more hashpower made it inevitable that mining would end up being centralized into areas with affordable power and decent infrastructure.
We are seeing the results of that play out today but there are broader issues at play as well.  What happens in the case of a major disaster (giant earthquake in China) or war when so much of the network processing capability is centralized?

Same boat here.
