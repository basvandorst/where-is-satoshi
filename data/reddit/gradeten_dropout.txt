I wish but I invested all of my available cash.
This is why I plan on taking a 2nd mortgage to buy more coins!
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:24:28
I tried but they won't let me get another one. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:33:15
I'm not gonna post pictures of my credit card statements.  Plenty of people have made the same choice as me.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:02:35
When it replaces fiat!
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:30:47
I'm not gonna lose money, I'm going to be rich because my faith in bitcoin is stronger! Please keep selling so that I can buy more cheap coins!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:21:10
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:39:15
A lot, but I have faith in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:38:19
End of 2018: $100,000.
End of 2019: $1,000,000
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:07:06
But once Bitcoin reaches $1,000,000 then I can afford to lose the price I paid for the bitcoins!
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:23:03
Bitcoin prices are trolling me. :-( I thought I would've been rich by now. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:22:21
[I'm not fucking selling!](
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:07:00
I bought more at $18k, $17k, $16k, and $15k. I may decide to take a second mortgage on my house soon if these cheap coins continue!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:21:54
My credit card interest: 24.99%
Bitcoin's average return: 600.00%
If you're not investing all you can with credit cards you're burning money!! It's just that bitcoin is dipping right now and it's just not fair. :-(
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:20:57
Yellow like the Bitcoin logo.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:41:02
Absolutely nothing if you believe in bitcoin strongly enough!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:23:15
I maximized all my credit cards. But It's okay because I can afford the minimum payments. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:05:32
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:09:13
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:21:30
Not enough!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:21:26
Not enough!
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:13:57
No I hold control and mouse wheel down 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:05:35
Wait so that means I can just get free bitcoins after declaring bankruptcy??
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:10:18
More confident than ever! All the weak hands are leaving so we're going to shoot for the moon very soon!
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:39:42
I used a credit card but I can afford the minimum balance payments.
But I plan on borrowing against my home to buy more soon!
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:04:23
Already answered: not enough!
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:25:01
Dude, Bitcoin is the SAFEST investment you can make.
It's not inflationary.
It can't be counterfeit.
It is decentralized.
The government cannot take it away from you.
That's why I maximized all my credit cards to buy bitcoin. Worst case to worst, I can declare bankruptcy, but I'll still have MY BITCOINS. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:11:47
Only if you pay for it in bitcoin in advance.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:28:44
If you can find someone to buy your kidney for bitcoins, it could be worth considering. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:27:11
You need to read the whitepaper and have faith in Satochi!
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:30:24
I'm not. Bitcoin has increased by more than 10,000% in the past and has reached less than 1% of the market. When it becomes the currency of the future, it's gonna increase in value by another 10,000% easily. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:25:01
Thanks for laughing at my troubles you jerk. :-(
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:10:53
Nothing if I haven't sold! HODL!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:22:43
That's what the banksters told me. Because they don't believe in the decentralized crypto revolution as it threatens their grasp on the current financial system!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:13:15
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:35:03
Not at a loss!
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:03:03
Yes I have. Have you?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:36:40
That's not how winning is done!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:45:18
The experts do not believe in crypto.
I have my entire faith in the whitepaper by satochi. Bitcoin has not reached a fraction of its real value. We are still all EARLY ADOPTERS. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:33:58
You just lack foresight. It's never going to be 0. Bitcoin has the first mover's advantage and will always be superior to shitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:02:55
That's right, it's believers like me who are the backbone of Bitcoin and will ensure we all get to the moon one day! Have faith!
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:10:23
It will! I read the white paper and looked at the charts - Every time Bitcoin goes down, it goes back up 10 times!
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:11:04
No :-(
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:14:21
I hope so!! I'm taking a 2nd mortgage on my house to buy more!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:23:37
[There's more science to be done!](
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:40:33
It's investing, not gambling. I'm investing in the future of money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:36:15
If you can't handle a loss, you have weak hands! Don't invest more than you're willing to lose!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:39:57
If you can't handle Bitcoin's 40% drops you don't deseve its 10,000% gains!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:03:50
It's not a loss if I don't sell!
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:12:43
It's not funny! :'(
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:26:22
Dude I'm not trolling! 
Bitcoin can yield 10,000% return, just zoom out the charts!! That's way above the 19.95% rate the credit cards charge me. 
You just gotta have faith.  If you're not maximizing your credit cards, you have weak hands and you're losing money by not taking advantage of this opportunity. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:31:11
If it goes to near 0, I could buy almost all of the bitcoins in existence, and the second it goes back up I'd be rich!
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:29:56
I'm going to cost average as soon as I can go to my bank and get a 2nd mortgage on my house for more buys!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:20:46
[Ya man.]( 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:45:26
[24 mph](
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:05
It's only ending ON THE MOON!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:31:37
That's what the banksters tell me. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:08:04
No. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:47:37
I don't need luck, you just need faith in a decentralized unregulated system invented by Satochi!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:29:32
HODL!!! Why should I sell at a near 50% loss?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:06:14
Because I gotta buy in the dips!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:13:26
I'm HODLING
