They tell people about details that they shouldn't share. 
Social engineering is a legitimate way to hack people these days, and it's being used more than ever. 
Don't post any identifying information. You location, age, skin color, anything that could used to look you up on social media/link your reddit account to other sites. 
Never use the same username on different sites. Never use the same password twice for anything. 
I suggest doing a copious amount of research in this.

I'd be laughing all the way to the bank, but I don't use one.

version control in development is very important.
Say you're working on an essay for class, and you're writing about subject A and how it is related to subject B, but you think that it might be better to write about how A is related to C instead, so you write 2 different versions. That is called a fork. Now, if you decide to turn in both papers as final, then that's a true hard fork. If you decide to only turn in one version, then you stuck with one fork, and killed the other. 
ETH has forked many times, as has almost every cypto.

The forks focus on many things. Some forks are security based, some are more for trying to slightly change the technology in order to try to improve the logistics. 
You can read the BIP (Bitcoin improvement proposals) online to find out more info. There are many forks, and there will be a hard fork in the near future (November). I suggest reading up on the latest one to make sure that you're ready.

Do we send people to school to learn things they already know?

I recommend starting on [bitcoin.org]( That's the official webpage. Go to the FAQ and start there.
There's plenty of other resources on the sidebar of this subreddit. 
You also should read the [white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto.](
