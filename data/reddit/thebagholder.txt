when u tried it what did it say? i believe they only allow 100 transactions per block, so it might of been full when u tried. they reset it every hour 
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:33:07
which wallet are u using and how much was the fee? 
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:35:22
use viabtc accelerator. put the txid into the box and fill out captcha. next time use higher fee

going to be very interesting

keep trying the viabtc accelerator. u want to use it at the beginning of a full hour. example its 4:20pm right now try when the clock hits 5:00. if u follow this ur transaction will eventually confirm

you can try ViaBTC accelerator. put the transaction id into the box and fill out the captcha. when viabtc successfully mines a block they will confirm up to 100 transactions.

multbits fee are too low, u should switch to a different wallet... try electrum. try viabtc accelerator in the mean time. put tx id into box and fill out captcha

itll get confirmed eventually dont worry. try this: 
u put in the transaction id into the box and fill out the captcha. fill this out at the start of an hour because they only accept 100 transactions an hour and then they reset. u will have to wait for them to successfully mine a block so it might take a few tries

u should switch wallets, the developer of multibit abandoned it awhile ago. multibit still uses default 0.0001 fee which is too low currently. u can use viabtc accelerator to move your bitcoin out of multibit and into a different wallet like electrum

the developer of mulitbit sold it to keepkey i believe. electrum wallet is a good alternative
