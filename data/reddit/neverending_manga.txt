Considering how long it's taking to implement a solution to the scaling issue, which is unanimously considered a problem, I don't see bitcoin itself changing much in any meaningful way, short of the core team continuing to get away with adding things like RBE to the protocol without consensus. Assuming this doesn't continue, any efforts to better bitcoin usability will have to come from supporting companies like coinbase.

Lets not kind ourselves into thinking that the government would not break and take a massive piss on their rules to get satoshi behind bars for life. With that understanding, a particularly vile government agent could use this to get another conviction under his/her belt.

So, how does bitcoin disrupt the status quo if *actually using it* stays a inconvenient endeavor that no one not ideologically motivated is willing to *actually* go through?  
Hell, I'm a total ancap with some tech know how and I don't like to touch bitcoin much less actually use it because I really don't want to worry about my value being lost or stolen because I pressed the wrong button somewhere. How on earth is bitcoin going to be used by the average joe without services like coinbase?

If Bitcoin can't even beat visa, then that casts a pretty bad light on it's ability to change society.

I shouldn't even broach the IP topic, but I have to point out that maidsafe will enable completely anonymous start-ups and file transfer protocols that the NSA can't track. Ignoring completely the ethical debate, how do you copyright?

I have trouble believing that an American citizen could be known to be Satoshi Nakamoto and *not* be iced.

Also, there's always renouncing US citizenship. You get free healthcare and the government will even ship you to a better country free of charge!

How does one maintain a modern government while limited to only property taxes that one could impose across the board? Also, how does one maintain the populations interest in dealing with the government as the quality of life of the population *improves* as the availability of government services and the strength of law enforcement inevitably *shrinks*? 
At the very least, governments would have to become the classical liberal government the founding fathers promised America just to survive.

Don't side/tree chains allow Alice to gave a bitcoin stand-in to Bob,  allowing Bob to have the bitcoins without ever being "given" the bitcoins?

One does not simply ban encryption. The financial system depends on encryption to function, so the only way a ban on encryption could potentially work is if only preapproved people could use encrypted communications with other preapproved people on preapproved devices, which would stomp on the rich folk's tax havens. We all know that any politician who goes after the rich folk's money is either gonna end up on a gay sex orgy tape or dead.

I have trouble buying this fundamentally, as the only way to eliminate banks is for everyone to become their own bank, and the idea that the average joe, or anyone who worked hard for their money, would refuse to push the stress of protecting their own money to someone else for a fee, regardless of how easy protecting one's own money would be, is an idea that I just can't make sense of. This is especially so when one starts to consider making one's bitcoin work for them. Joe sixpack is not and never will be Warren Buffett.

I believe dnale0r is talking about blacklisting the bitcoins themselves. Though even in that case, I don't see how blacklisting bitcoins would stop those coins from being used for sidechains projects and being used that way.

I'm iffy on if pushing the citizinry into the cashless society is a good idea from a tyrant perspective. Yeah, you'd know everything the people do with your money, but you also effectively make fiat the same thing as bitcoin in the average Joe's eyes, making bitcoin adoption alot easier. Especially if the only private or superior products are all accepting bitcoin. 
I think Star Wars has a quote for this. Something about a tight fist and star systems leaking out.

In addition to what Indigo said, the mere existence of start-ups with "grow worth of company cryptocurrency" as a business model allows people to straight up buy ****-tons of bitcoin with another cryptocurrency and say that they got a lucky investment, with minimum money spent setting up the narrative.

The big problem I see here is that we're going to start getting incentivized and decentralized internet apps like maidsafe, storj (down the line), and others around the time that this is going to come to fruition, and filesharers using those apps will be protected from the government attacks through the built in end-to-end encryption those apps have.

Silk Road was successful and had an income stream set-up, so if I was putting my money on the line, I'd say that openbazaar will not be the next Silk Road because it will ultimately lose to one of the openbazaar forks that do have an income stream due to the superior marketing, features, and services the profiting forks will be able to offer. At best, it'll secure a linux-like situation where companies throw money at the openbazaar team so that they don't have to worry about maintain the code. Eitherway, it won't be a silk road.

You're assuming the US government doesn't *want* ISIS to attack American locations so that they can gain more control/taxes.

If Joystream has end to end encryption as good as the other projects, then that would definitely help it compete, and I imagine that it would have to to get people to host *paid* seeds. To my knowledge though, that's not something bittorrent apps tends to do for some odd reason.

No, I just put my tyrant hat on and deduced that it's hard to demonize drugs and justify beating untold amounts of hippies and shooting unimaginable amounts of dogs, or otherwise ending or ruining peoples lives if the drug market is all people ordering meth on the darknet and screwing up their own lives.

That's what the code the team is making would allow people to do. My point was that it won't be the team's implementation of the code that people will use to facilitate online commerce, but some other company using the code to fuel their market.

Um, even if reddit becomes a protocol, it will end up being developed aka controlled by people who actually have the skills necessary to maintain such a program, so it *still* wouldn't satisfy the "decentralize everything" desire, and thus you'd still hate it.

Sounds like something I'd love to use/support, but how much personal info would I have to give to use the service?
