alts, this is a subreddit about bitcoin, not crypocurrency
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:39:48
They are the only one laughing
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:38:44
but it is grazy. glad I bought more lately. you should look at depth charts.  I see opportunities till at least 2k
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:52:40
wow thank you for the time you made up writing this.
but in the end, why where you assuming people are uneducated and brainwashed. I was just asking stuff. isn't this what this subreddit is about. 
Glad you wanted to help me out. but don't tell me how to act. as I don't try to tell Phd programmers how to let bitcoin be in existence. 
I could just have been on the meme side of reddit and see that crypto X is gaining more than crypto Y, and all of a sudden start believing in crypto X. 
No, I asked, am more in knowledge. feel a bit more dunning-kruger affected. but I try making a backed opinion. so I think you are pointing to the wrong person. only because I am not yet in knowledge.

True, but here it means currencies not backed by gold excempt crypto currencies

@_date: 2018-01-12 10:07:16
they keep having the same amount of btc though
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:28:22
this was definitely a wall though
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:04:34
I don't get it. why built a sell wall, when there is a HUGE buy wall upcoming. don't you have enough time, whale
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:57:07
though btc is in a recession, im still in profit. and more than people investing in regular stocks. so I don't care. even I ff I lose all my profit. this environment has thought me a lot
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:52:02
cause every technical analyse I make says it. suspect a las drop to 8kUSD. then I don't know the the path is open to new ATH. maybe a long run. 
AND, SK unbans exchanges starting from februari, CNY 16th feb. countries are more and more setting a positive mindset on BTC. before the big bil run to 20k, I only heard FUD. last weeks a hear positive news. so next to positive tech analyses, sentimentical is going positive too. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:52:25
hard to correlate. its not a linear motion and other aspects played a role

Because alts have faster transactions
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:28:00
you can see it on Gdax. loads of other exchanges where already across 16k. but Gdax/Coinbase is still a mayor-player. only look at the ifleuence on Bcash they had.. even if it where inside trading
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:37:45
Go to coinmarketcap. Click bitcoin and see the exchanges with biggest cap to choose from

I live in a democracy. if they ban ill go on the street and ruin the capitol with my fella's. gov will fall and be replaced with a rebellion of ours. crypto's will be the officials currency

same here!
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:39:48
the lines displayed are Ema12 and Ema26 averages. google to make clear. wheneve to cross with low price, this is the moment to buy. whales know this and use it to manipulate by putting sell and buy walls whenever needed. consider this as a sign to buy
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:19:03
I understand they can have back log but this is a problem.
maybe you people should try to send some ethereum or/and litceoin - Bitcoin does have some problem with transaction validation now to date.
so maybe the problem isn't at bitsane. who knows

I think too, this might be good for the long rung.
I am also in for the idea of using excess energy from solar panels in winter, or wind mills in autumn  for mining. and create some kind of backlog in the periods there's is less energy. 
so instead of let the computer give the amount of energy he needs to accomplish a task, give him the amount of time to accomplish a task giving the vast amount of energy
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:46:11

you got me there. never thought it that way; but aren't you assuming that the amount of nodes stays the same over that 50 year period, so the interest of people?
doesn't we have to look at them separately?
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:37:48
crossings of ema 12- ema 26 simply mean, its time to buy. if you zoom out, to lets say 6hr or day charts, you can see it better. just burst that wall people! 14840 wall of 46 btc. you can see whales adding buy's. 
mayor rise is coming. 
then break through 16k for new moon
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:52:15
Go away instead of creating FUD. You look like a fed reserve guy. People are working on segwit and LN and bitcoin will revive and have higher domination %

@_date: 2018-01-10 07:23:42
so maybe as I said. transfer some to gdax and then to another exchange; if then it doesn't show up, its on bitsane.

Answer 2 months ago. Better yesterday dan today. Answer nowadays, looking at EMA12 EMA26 and social structures this is the right moment to buy
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:15:28
those big exchanges aren't good for btc too. I start seeing those typical bull to bear to bull charts.. they are making money. 
money isn't flowing in btc as it should be, I think, because lots of exchanges are overcrowded, due to the suc6. wait and see when everybody is on again
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:36:56
Binance might work? It did for me lastly
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:06:50
because every damn exchange is down, exempt for coinbase. but I wan't to open 'horizonts'. tried kraken, its buggy and full of errors. trying bitstamp, seems legit, but overloaded networks.. I was just wondering 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:09:28
Maybe. Maybe not. Everybody who looks at charts tries to make something out of it for future predictions. Whats the point of looking at them otherwise. If it were not for that intrest, i would look at the price. Not a chart. 
But i try making something out of, yes. Instead looking at it like a monkey. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:21:41
**update**: whenever you want to transfer monet from Coinbase, first transfer it to Gdax. and then send further to a other exchange. I don't know why, but I think Coinbase is lagging because of the Mobile App witch I mainstream used, while Gdax isn't. they are the same btw.  
forgot to mention this 
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:35:24
I dont know. But i cant find it in the app store either
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:26:28
maybe noobish but, shouldn't the law of Moore be applied to block size. therefore they are too small nowadays? so an increase lets tech develop. admit it, if this wasn't true, we would all be on an '98.
btw; taking that in account, haven't they gone smaller. because on everything else, the law was applied?

I think lots of people do care about easy to store decentralized money.
i'll give you one example; jews have been in diamonds for a long time. they dominate this, why? its like gold but more value to it. and everybody knows why they don't trust governments, government institutions, and government printed not backed by gold money
so please, if you find that jews aren't interested in crypto? tell me about it
  this is just one example
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:11:35
watch out when talking about the forbidden word. I was banned for that for a day. this is r/bitcoin. all I have to say about that. 
I would recommend coinbase in the beginning, GDAX is part of coinbase, keep that in mind when buying, selling for fees
further I think bitstamp and Gemini are ok. but im trying them myself just

I was able to deposit some btc yesterday, and today to set an buy order. now I am waiting for the order to be completed. hope it will be soon. 
so far the site seem legit to mee. google tells me it's a rather small exchange but it hasn't been attacked yet so far. maybe due to the smallnes

@_date: 2019-04-02 08:54:37
see it as a emotional result. buys are never done on 1 coin. people see bitcoin rising, and the buy new coins, but for the whole wallet they have. see it as going to the shop to only buy a bread, pas the cashier, you bought 5 items..
or.. it is not bitcoin who is rising, but tether who is falling (and not backed by USD), as happend before.. PURE SPECULATION on this one!

you didn't invest. you changed. 
investing is buying shares from a firm, and receiving dividends.
you just changed your fiat to BTC. just as you would cross the border from france to Uk and go to your local bank to change some euro to pond. 
you think you are investing because you hope one day btc will be worth more in pair to your fiat. 
if you would invest in bitcoin. you would have set up a node or something

as far as I knew, paypal isn't really into Bitcoin. the first day I wanted to buy bitcoi, I wrote some money to my paypal acc. openend an account on a exchange only to find out I had to retransfer my money to a normal bank account and send to that particular exchange.

if they would use lower fees, and the mempool isn't as empty as it nowadays, they get tickets they have to solve (use real manpower). customers(average joes) pay the fees, not knowing they could pay less elsewhere. and coinbase doesn't get any ticket. both parties happy in ignorance.

Wow man. Indead we are seeing a recovery now
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:56:42
are you saying that people don't have to pay taxes in USA? explains shit social/health caring, the great inequality among citizen.
don't get me wrong.  I like the idea of 'liberty' and so on. but some regularization is always needed. 
the boston tea party shook the European old politics of it's throne. a good cause, caused by some new global thoughts. bitcoin, or more the upcoming pirate alike revolution of crypto currency is about to do the same now. great time to be alive. but within no time new governments will make is usable and taxable.
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:36:18
maybe. but only a short touch. then we go back down for a moment. the last drop I think
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:39:18
if I buy 'bitcoin' on a exchange; don't they have to buy the actual bitcoin to back mine? so they're wallet should grow as everybody buys more/ or drop like a brick as in jan '18
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:43:08
And the usability of btc would be gone again. I think adoption must be greater.  speculator should gone and the people should be buying eater eggs with bitcoin before it goes up such a way
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:43:02
countries can still tax. if it is for bitcoin, or for fiat or gold. it's just the time it takes for governments to adopt bitcoin( or crypto).
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:30:55
So they only grow, but youre btc is still backed by theyres
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:04:36
I don't think those trends can be compared, but in general you are right. consider it more as the '13-14' chart
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:01:45

=892 345 660,2
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:56:00
you never said how much profit you made from selling at 750, and as long as you don't  sell, you don't lose
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:07:06
you are right. as long as you don't sell you don't lose
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:33:21
bitcoin will bounce back. I think (hope, admitted) this is the last correction before we go up again
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:41:08
down depends on the time you bought
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:02:49
or just plain
BTC 150K
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:45:52


again, it's not the kind of money, weather it is crypto, fiat, gold or gems that make it possible to distrubite weatlth, its laws that does. and you can say that crypto is free from supervision, world leaders will find a way to solve that problem. something like registration or so
