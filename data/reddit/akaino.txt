Where do you live?
Taxes are very different per country.
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:02:02
Im so sure you'll get those btc!
I for one love vague intel to services and throw my money in!
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:31:05
That's a whole new level of shitposting.

You might want to scan the drives manually.
For windows, install sth. like "treesize". Much better overview of your folder structures.
Now go to the most common folders first:






Then search for .dat within treesize.
View over the files if sth. looks similar etc.
It's quite hard to help in this case without access to the computer.
And you really don't want to give access to your computer to strangers, generally spoken.
But if you really need the help, TeamViewer might be one simple solution. You control the connection and can end it at any time.
However I do not recommend this to strangers as well. There might be very intelligent people here able to hijack your machine fast enough even with teamviewer controlled by you.
You know, opening a website can be enough, theoretically.
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:09:31
It should be wallet.dat, yes.
Try checking here too:




You may also want to try searching the disk with Powershell (integrated in windows):


It most certainly will take a while though.
Replace "C:\" with other drives if needed.
You might have to run powershell as local Administrator depending on your user rights.
Don't worry, this script only searches. It doesn't move nor manipulate anything.
Almost every "Get-" cmdlet only "gets" stuff.




@_date: 2017-08-18 05:17:14
Unfortunately not. It's just running and printing the files if something was found.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:37:12
Yes it is. Not hard though.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:55:08
I second this^^
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:15:05
Well it will. It's just... slow.

That's... impressive. I'm still struggling with the decision which link to click on.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:28:19
Is this a thing now in this sub?
Guess I need to stay away until those shit posts have an end (or mods start working).

On iOS I'm using [Crypto Widget]. Does it's job pretty well!
On windows, simple as is, 245778 browser tabs (or two when chrome eats my RAM, coinbase and bitfinex).
No android for me!

You read all the info in ~5 minutes?
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:48:41


Yeah. Totally possible. I'll just remove all my btc chart widgets. Easy af. No pressure at all. /s
But I get your point.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:09:13
It's high rising course tells otherwise.
Media is on the run too so...

If you can't figure out how to buy/sell bitcoin by a single google statement you're wrong here.
Plus, don't invest in Bitcoin unless you *really* can afford to lose money. Because eventually you probably will.

*Ask around and do research on BTC man - most people **you hear from** regret it.*
Just saying. You don’t hear much from People worth successful hair transplants as they mostly don’t want people to know about it.
Other that that, doing research is always a decent idea!

Does saving the money guarantee the surgery (even if it takes longer)? If yes, ignore BTC.
If you can lose that money without worry, go for it.
BTC is fragile. It will (probably) ever be. 
You can be lucky and make 15k from your 2.5k investment.
You can also make 500$ from your 2.5k investment.
So, if you asked me, a random stranger, I’d recommend the safe way. Even more as it’s about your own health.
If you asked me, a BTC hodler, I say go for it. Pushes the price for me to sell.
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:50:40
Depending on the fee, yes. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:21:08
40$ for 100 stickers and you're okay with that?
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:24:45
Congrats. But, uhm, does he raise the market value now?
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:13:39
If the brutal downfall to almost ~3k (EUR) means *don't care* then yes.

Clickbaity and somewhat informative.
That's rare.
When I posted this op had a picture of Bitcoins overall heights every March every year. I think.

A tent costs like ~150$?

Basically just never sell then?
