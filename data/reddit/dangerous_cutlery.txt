Anyone could have seen this rhetoric coming out of the White House the moment Libra was a Facebook idea.
The Money Printers can't take out bitcoin lawfully - so They asked their best buddy Facebook to make Libra to give them an Avenue of Attack (ie govt going after Libra) while also spreading a culture of distaste for Cryptocurrency.
Libra will get Regulated/Destroyed, and Bitcoin by Proxy now.
The petrodollar is going to fight until the Oceans are stained red from blood.

Pensions were developed/offered to keep people working careers that are potentially fatal - destroy the physical body / spine over time through manual labor - Require 60-80 hour Work weeks and/or traveling causing missed family/private life. They started being offered once First World Nations experienced the initial stages of the "Service Industry", where career driven people were taking comfortable indoor desk jobs that paid more than Manual Labor intensive or high travel careers did.
For example - Iron Workers. Another Example - I have a family member who works for the FDA, they must travel internationally and often do 80 Hour weeks - to keep people interested they offer a VERY VERY generous pension.
Anyway - These were contracts agreed upon. One would be an ignorant fool to think that it's no big deal that employers no longer honor their contract in a Law driven society.

Without inflation stored money wouldn't become more valuable every day - Instead people would stop focusing on doing evil and maybe spend time helping their local  communities and families.

The only problem is plebs seem to think laws mean anything beyond 'spell-craft' (words or ideas that manifest);the elite basicly ignore laws or just rewrite/reinterpret them.

The "East" has been trying to save their currencies encouraging many to hold that instead.
The "West" is on a mission to destroy itself and USD.

the rewards have more to do with obtaining processing fees from merchants - which usually means higher prices for the consumers as a whole as merchants need to respond.
Buying a coffee at a gas station with a CC, for example, would get the cardholder maybe 5 cents in rewards - but VISA gets to charge the Merchant sometimes 30 cents or more per transaction.
This is why many smaller retailers have CC minimums, and retailers who sell HIGH ticket items offer discounts for using CASH instead (CC transactions that are larger amount the processor takes a % of the sale instead of a flat fee).
CREDIT CARDS are terrible - They encourage DEBT and force Merchants to pass fees onto the Consumer.
Bitcoin has fees as well (and no DEBT/Borrow component) and is ultimately what is keeping it from ever dethroning fiat/Credit system.

What I was initially responding to &gt; " if inflation didn't exist then why would I spend money if I could just save \[it\] and it become more valuable every day? " &lt; The idea or argument, that Inflation is good/needed because of how it causes economic growth through spending/investing to support growing populations.
However, in a world without inflationary "wealth" or economic stimulus - storing it (or investing) would not be as prosperous as 'theory' wants to argue.
All bitcoin could be lost except 1 coin, and it wouldn't matter in an economic system that had ZERO inflationary currencies - government stimulus - or forced slave labor.
The arguments/theory involving Inflation/Deflation forget that these are social principles and rely on what the people socially decided to do with governing/trading/communing their "wealth" \[which was generated through labor\].
In a Utopia (no evil) or Natural Survival Environment (without social interference) - wealth denominations would always EQUAL out towards LABOR; making the idea of 'holding' on to wealth for growth, or spending to avoid devalue meaningless.

If only a few parties owned the Majority of bitcoin, it is almost certain that it would cease to have any value anymore as the rest of those participating would just forsake it instead.
