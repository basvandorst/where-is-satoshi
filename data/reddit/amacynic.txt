If your life depends on photoshop yes.  But gimp is a great piece of software for the majority of people (non professionals) and I am grateful for the work that team puts in.

You are correct.  Sorry to trigger your OCD there.  I usually say "couldn't" there so not sure why I wrote could.

Not sure if you are just being glib.  Convert to dollars through an exchange and move to their bank account. 200 satoshis should be a bit of an overpay today but will get it there quick.

So much this. I could give  rats ass about the price on a day to day basis.  Just look at how disruptive bitcoin is to conventional financial services and remittances.  How can you not be excited for the future and where this is going.   
However I think cashing out via fiat will be almost required though as we pay our taxes that way.  Who has enough regular dollars lying around to pay the capital gains taxes.  Unless government start accepting bitcoin for tax settlement purposes I would think cashing out will continue as is.

His bet was with a well known mutual fund or hedge fund manager (can't remember which) that said their active investment style likely can't beat passive index investing due to the frictional costs of trading.
He did a big service to small investors on this one.  How many people chase the latest hot mutual fund.  It's an exercise in futility.  A passive investing approach using index funds will track the market minus a very small cost.
He's not a hypocrite for telling big time money managers they are full of shit and if you are a small investor you should heed that advice.  Very few mutual funds have a long term track record of beating the S&amp;P.  Like a ridiculously small amount.

How do some miners get free electricity?

I am only stating that the headline is not what was said.  It makes sound like one world currency when what was stated was world currency of the internet.  Much different.
Of course we have no way of knowing, but to say one world currency in the context of the article is wrong.

If this comes to pass we will be living in an entirely different oppressive world and will have bigger problems than not being able to use bitcoin.  The part that concerns me is that it is entirely possible, these things happen over long periods of time and are barely noticeable as it happens.
Also never underestimate an old rich white guys motivation to protect his wealth.

This tells us nothing unless we know your thought process when you sold.

Single world currency and single world currency of the internet are two entirely different things.  I am long on bitcoin and believe in the technology, but the headline is sensationalist and false.
One changes the world dramatically, the other kills paypal, mastercard and visa.

I am not a miner but this is what I would assume.  As price falls difficulty should fall as miners leave.  As price rises difficulty should rise as more miners come in.  What I am not sure about is the lead time to those changes.  Fairly easy to stop mining and switch to an alt, but difficult for new miners to ramp up (buy and configure the hardware).

First off don't come to Reddit for credibility.  Come here for the entertainment value.  There are so many people here who discuss from a position of bias or raw emotion.  You only need to look at the whole tribalism around alts or how many people base the value of bitcoin on what it is worth in dollars.  How many people here who have trolled one way or the other have even read Sathoshis white paper.
Many economists are also tribal, they don't understand cryptocurrency in general but still feel the need to say things like "bubble, tulips" etc.
My interest in bitcoin started in early 2013 but I was aware of it long before that.  I have spent a lot of time learning about the techology, how mining works, how to safely store it etc.  Many people here don't even know that a wallet and a address are completely different things but still give their opinions.  It makes for fun reading sometimes and I don't think that would necessarily improve if more economists joined in.  Many of them have their biases and would get roasted here.  Even those economists who own it and who would have valuable input to add would most likely get roasted by people who are too emotional about it.

It's money and jealousy rears its head anytime it is involved.  There is a lot of competition for wealth, so for many people it stings when others find it before them.  This is not unique to Bitcoin.  
Jealousy is something I have learned to remove from my personality.  I am genuinely happy for people when the do well, and since I have taken this approach things have gone better for me as well.  All that wasted energy just unloaded.

I see, nice deal if you can find it.  Thanks for the reply.
