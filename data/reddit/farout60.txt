Uhh every FUD post gets bashed by people saying “STOP SPREADING FUD”. It’s like unless it’s positive, they don’t want to hear it.

The market is correcting and most people don’t believe it man.

Market is correcting, it’s over saturated, growing too quickly, Dogecoin. Tons more
Everyone thinks they’re gonna be rich. It’s ridiculous.

Dude yes. I completely agree and really wish  people would stop letting bitcoin control the entire market. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:19:28
Literally all over reddit. Negative post get downvotes and bashed.

I’d argue that Nothing is safer than eth rn.

I don’t get it. If your trying to maximize your returns, why would you invest in bitcoin. It needs to go to 30k to hit 100% return. I think wall street is smarter than this

You’re right. We’re all gonna be rich.

Are you trying to make a quick profit or hold long term. If it’s the latter then sell 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:30:03
No but I’m interested in FUD and wanna hear the bad news too but people who have legitimate concerns are gettin silenced. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:44:31
Bet you’re down 40%

Idk. Stop shilling shitcoins, Promote caution in the market. People are fucking taking out loans and second mortgages and will probably lose everything. There’s too much hype

Gotta buy that Nasdaq dip
