Got mine today. Same thing. Envelope was partially ripped and taped shut by the post again. One holo sticker was hanging off the plastic box.
&lt;tinfoil&gt;  
If I were a baddie, that's pretty much exactly what I would do to make the recipient believe it was shredded by a sorting machine. My trust level in Entropy at this point: minus fifty stars.  
Anyway, trying to flash the firmware now, but it reliably fails.
* holding the button during insertion opens a folder BOOTLOADER instead of ME-CONFIG as stated on the website
* after copying the 1.1 firmware file (sha checks out) and ejecting, the light keeps pulsating slowly (button press after eject doesn't do anything)
After subsequent re-insert, I get the 3-blink error (not enough entropy detected).
So at this point I think it could either be a broken device or someone really tampered with it on the way. I just hope they™ didn't place any badUSB crap on it and infected my computer now...
Any thoughts?
**Update:** they went through several debugging steps with me and finally concluded that the unit is defective. A new one is on the way to me. Thanks and everyone else at Mycelium for being awesome!
**Update 2** After returning my damaged Entropy to Mycelium, and after some tracking number issues, I have now finally received a replacement. The sticker placement was a bit better, they added one directly to the device. I've re-flashed it (just to be safe), salted it, tested it and I'm happy to say that it's working as advertised. Thanks to and the rest of the team for fixing this for me.
