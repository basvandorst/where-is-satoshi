Short story is that Clif has been parsing the internet for years with WebBots that scour data about language used across several domains of knowledge and sources. 
Clif then started putting pattern analysis to the usage of "language" given within the context of other "language" it's associated with. 
This allows for the recognition of trends through the frequency of which certain "language" is being used and identified by web spiders. 
The trends themselves are synthesized by Clif himself in term of "focusing" the raw data that comes out of the spiders. 
So...he's been dealing in data for a long time, he just stated an alternative for Bitcoin. 
Is it actually viable? Seemingly simple? Surely it can't be that easy? Is it?

Nice. No kidding on the "switch." Not sure why from a code perspective this would be difficult? Besides SDLC I mean really, it should be a pretty simple change with massive customer experience points. 
Everybody just sayin... just sayin...

There's no mention of: 
1) Bitcoin
2) Crypto Currency 
3) Digital Currency
4) Blockchain Technology
In 2013 this report (which was very similar) was their 10 year plan. It seems they would rather expedite their ideas. I wonder why?

Apologies for the "fire drill." You're right -- this was a CTRL+F on keywords and in this case I should have included just "digital" to find your reference. I love Reddit fact checking. Thanks
