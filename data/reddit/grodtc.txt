Play it safe and wait it out in fiat. Probably some good deals coming on both coins.

So now you're mad that my advice is consistent? Well I guess you've got one thing right: we should just let the people decide who makes more sense. �� 
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:25:56
I sold half of mine. It will drop harder than this before it's all over.

Apparently *you* aren't aware of your own laws in Switzerland (or your lawyer has explained them to you poorly). But don't worry fellas, been doing this full time since 2015 and always pay my taxes. I just hand over all my records to my tax accountants and pay whatever they say I owe. Has never been a problem for me but, since you guys are scared, let me know if you need some help figuring all this out. ��

Exit. Sell Bitcoin now, buy back way cheaper soon.
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:30:15
Enter back in slowly. I bought some at 2442 but now in think another dip is coming. I have buys for 2311, 2222 and 1988 and 1111. The volatility may not be over days. If you're not a day trader best to wait in cash until everything is resolved.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:28:15
It's not too late to get out and buy back in lower. Slight rise right now, sell and buy the next big dip.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:45:20
Looks like it's up a bit. Sell some now and wait for something closer to 2k.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:14:58
Nothing wrong with that!
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:38:19
�� yeah, nothing like jumping off a sinking battleship and onto a sinking dinghy!!! I'm on it!
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:35:42
Um, okay. So helping people dodge dumps and buy dips is fud? Guess I better start charging for my "fud" then bc if you check the time stamps on my comments and the charts, my calls are spot on. Sorry you're too scared to make any moves. Better luck in the next life.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:44:23
The coins won't be worth much. And at a 1:1 ratio, not worth it. Sit in cash until everyone dumps and you can buy both cheaper.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:21:39
It's gonna drop lower no matter what. Poke away!!
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:14:54
This is why I advise people to wait in cash. If this was easy for you to understand then a google search would have solved your query already. But since you still don't get it, stay away. Let's just say that it's a lot more complicated than you think, even if the results only equal up or down from your pov.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:42:58
Nobody gives two shits what you do with that .1 BTC you're hodling, lol! I love all you noobs who turn expert when the price is down and you forgot to sell high. See you at the bottom!
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:49:01
Most of the people investing aren't that technically inclined. They start seeing what it takes to manage the coins on forked chains and they are out in cash till the dust settles. The other mistake with this calculation is the fact that Eth was cheap when it split. Little risk to holding it during the split. BTC costs thousands and the return will be in dollars. Only dumb money chases that kind of risk/reward.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:02:05
Smart money isn't holding volatile crypto that costs thousands a coin just so they can get some shitcoin that will be worth virtually nothing. Only a few confused noobs are hoarding small amounts of Bitcoin thinking their stash will double somehow. What's really going to happen is that anyone holding Bitcoin is going to lose value and people holding cash will buy cheap Bitcoin. It's already happening. I think it will go lower so I still have cash ready. As you can see from the price, many people are liquidating to wait it out in fiat.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:42:18
Wow. Are you actually this confused or are you just trying to confuse others? The risk per dollar earned on etc is completely different than this situation. Perhaps you don't realize that this new coin is not going to come out the same price as Bitcoin? You are literally advocating risking thousands of dollars per unit to make maybe tens of dollars per unit? That's just stupid.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:25:45
Down down down
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:51:18
Lol, nothing has changed to make it go up. And buying thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin to get a few bucks worth of a shitcoin is a terrible risk/reward ratio.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:24:45
Time for the correction. Waiting in cash till 2k or less.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:27:04
It's going down even lower than this soon.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:04:20
Lol, I've already closed another short since this thread started. It's already headed down. I already sold high and will soon start to buy small amounts low. Only ones getting left behind are the ones too scared to make moves.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:36:55
I would wait until everyone starts dumping coins on the markets. Look at historical charts of coins hitting markets and you will see that long red candle at the beginning that signifies the dump. That's when you buy. It will be cheaper than buying bitcoins to hold (bitcoins who value will likely drop) and hope to get "free" worthless coins.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:43:59
I don't stress, I just set low buy orders and high sell orders. The volatility makes all the money for me. But, to each his own, cheers good hodler!
