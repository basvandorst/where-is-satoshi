Assuming I know what you mean, I'm hoping to change that. lol

Thank you. I'll check it out now.

Are there types of programming that are more or less valuable, or should they all be pursued?
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:50:43
I think it's a very valuable idea. Perhaps hiring someone is more realistic. Since I don't know what it takes to create what I envision, I don't really know. I didn't want to hire a team of developers out of pocket. If it wasn't too expensive, if they were philanthropic, or if they'd do it for the potential of donations, I guess that might work.

An open source, decentralized, low/no cost, version of something that is very popular and high revenue today, that no centralized, *or* non-cryptocurrency, version could compete with. I'd like 99% of the revenues to stay with the users, and with 1% go to whichever three addresses are most popular. It started with me thinking I'd cut Satoshi a % if I ever built something, and evolved into the idea that fund raising would be a main draw of the service. Each user could submit some number of addresses, and the 3 most popular addresses would receive 1%, which is miniscule compared to the 30-50% used for whatever reason in the current models today (and which aren't directable by the users).
I have no intention of creating an altcoin, though it might be necessary to be one. I'm not sure. It certainly wouldn't be to create a currency, but to create a decentralized service that people with cryptocurrencies could use.

Thank you. I guess my idea is not only for the service in mind that could exist in a digital, decentralized form, but also with the user defined 1% idea which could be implemented by any service.

Someone could replicate the idea and keep a large % for themselves, and the global, decentralized, nature of it would still be far more popular than the existing options. In order to control where that revenue is going, they'd need to either fix it to an address they could eventually lose control of, or make it not be a decentralized, algorithmic, solution which would diminish trust and make it something other than what I believe would be ultimately valuable to everyone.

I'll take the opportunity to mention that r/bitcoin should be replaced by a decentralized option asap.
If you don't believe that there are influences outside of the voting taking place on submission exposure on sites like reddit, or digg, you've either not been paying attention for very long, or only in trivial discussions.
r/bitcoin, and other discussion forums that could be corrupted, are fine..  but they shouldn't be depended on for the sharing of critical information.
I don't really think it matters why a centralized forum may need or want to influence the conversation. I think that in the matter of all critical issues we need to know that there isn't a center to be corrupted and capable of manipulating the information.

Thank you. I'll look into it. For what I have in mind, once released into the wild there wouldn't be any revenue to share in. Though perhaps if people appreciated the service as I imagine they would, they could enter the developers' addresses into the pool of potentials to split the 1%. Maybe it could be designed to pay out to 3 specific addresses for a month or so, and then open up to the most popular from then on? I think part of the attraction would be that 100% of the revenue would stay with the users, and 1% of it would be directed to the most popular proposed addresses. Also, I don't like the idea of a cut permanently going to a fixed address which could be stolen, or lost. I like the idea of it being decided on by the users, as I see that most likely not being corrupted, or wasted.

I assume that if it's not built the way I want now, it will be built eventually by someone who wants to profit from it (which I don't have a problem with. I don't mind someone copying me with their version to make money, but I would have a problem copying theirs to cut them out of the loop and create a free service).
Certainly if I knew of someone who was capable and who would share the same vision, I'd gladly support them in creating it. Since I don't know how to tell that before describing it to someone, I'd like to create it myself.
