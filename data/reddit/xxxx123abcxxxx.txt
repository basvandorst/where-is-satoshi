Not quite the Black Monday —phew! Live another day.
However, the projection is on price and structure, not time.

The purpose of the chart is to illustrate how price forms in fractals; and how exponential bubble curves usually decline 80% of value when they burst. This happens on all time scales: hour, day, week, month, year.

The imminent crypto crash starts once the following price levels are crossed below to the downside:
BTC/USD (Bitfinex): $11,651
BTC/USD (Coinbase): $12,500
The crash then accelerates with terminal velocity once the lows of 22 Dec 2017 are crossed to the downside. At which point many exchanges may likely experience outages, preventing fund deposits/withdrawals and the closing/opening of positions.
