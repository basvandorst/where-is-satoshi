Erm, will you explain WHAT exactly "you got"? 
I see some twitter posts. So?
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:24:38
Seems you were right back then :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:59:17
I think, it was meant like: "Even IF he invented bitcoin, he would never admit it"
That's what I thought, when I read it the first time.

If daddy aint no more on 18th birthday, the coins are lost... doesnt help much.

When did you start the withdrawal?
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:24:35
...meanwhile you are lacking "yo" and "is". And you put an "s" where none is supposed to be.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:11:16
It's even more likely than your hypothesis since no company would be so stupid pulling this off and there is the twitter post.
So yeah, you are right.

Where is the original auctioning thread?
How many BTC did he pay?
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:25:33
It's legit! I tried it!

With SWT it will look like any native plattform application. It is very simple to meet native recommendations with java - you just have to do it.
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:17:18
...and spent :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:53:42
Worked fine for me!?

I think you got it the other way around. Read the article.

The kid and the teacher might be related? Why?

My bitcoin-qt is up to date.
How do I transfer the blockchain to another computer?
When I tried to just copy it, it said there were errors in the chain and it needs to download it again.
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:04:47
So? Where is my reward for finding that? :)
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:34:06
Thanks for the explanation.
Client is Bitcoin-QT, and I cant find those informations. But now I know.
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:53:39
Those are pretty harsh accusations yet you don't have proof.
Even the IP ranging at the same location is not proof. Could be the neighbour next door thinking he does a favor, or an employee acting all by himself.
A logo design company could easily use just the other symbol and still make profit. They will still have a profit with either symbol. They just favor one and made a website about it.
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:53:38
Play totally honest and explain how you got involved.
Bring in as many documentation as possible.
@_date: 2014-04-11 08:00:30
Thank you very much for this detailed answer. That's what I was looking for! Thumbs up.

If using firefox report that site.
Go to "Help" and "Report site".
Same as:
If you report it, firefox and chrome will place a big fat warning

How could you not realise, you were paying fees all the time? You have to accept every fee and click "ok" for it to be included in the transaction.
@_date: 2014-04-24 07:58:31
Why would you post such a question? It is obviously spam... so just report it and go on.
@_date: 2014-05-19 10:55:06
Of course it does make sense to run a full node client. 
But using torrent to get the blockchain is a lot faster than via the client.
So download the blockchain via the torrent and then run a full node -&gt; win
@_date: 2014-04-24 10:24:07
I am aware of that. But in both cases - bot or not - it is spam.

Of course Gnome tried to talk to Groupon, but Groupon didn't change anything. Instead they registered even more trademarks.

If all the money is in mtgox, do you haveto pay taxes on it in yourcountry?

Printout of the deal on website where it was initiated or something... I don't know what you got. Take as much as possible.

Creepy indeed.
That post mentioned the OP:
So I searched for this corresponding thread and saw your comment :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:48:53
Not having to do with any of the parties, I have a good explanation:
The dude who did the edit (and the twitter post) knows the company since he lives right next to it and thought he would do ecogex a favour.
I don't like the tone of your accusations here and somehow think you might be a competitor of ecogex who is trying to deface them.

The nodes do not mine. They just hold and provide the blockchain
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:24:28
Almost the very same story for me.

Isn't that supposed to be the other way around?


Private Key is unrecoverable and funds donated to public key will be lost.

How did you travel? By train? Car? 
How did you pay for that?
@_date: 2016-01-13 14:56:22
How did you pay for food on the street. Say if you wanted to eat a Döner or Hamburger or whatever?

Can anyone dig out a thread like this from two years ago?

Could you provide the file?

If that guy never bought the pizza for 10000 btc, do you think that many people would know about bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:40:08
If noone ever used or sold their coins the price would never have risen. 
Instead of looking back like that be proud you were part of bitcoin happening at all.
