My only request is that you **please try not to downvote** other people stories.

He was just playing the market to make a few bucks off of paycoin, not like he was supporting to hodl it. In his own words he says he believes that all altcoins will eventually fizzle out, and he supports Bitcoin.

Josh convinced everyone several months ago to switch their (at the time, still somewhat profitable) mining to mine "hashpoints" instead of bitcoin. which could be exchanged for paycoin. I think he is referring to the months a lot of users spent mining hashpoints instead of bitcoin or litecoin or whatever the hell it is they actually mined before paycoin.

He is jumping at any chance he has to get out of the bad situation he was brought up in, a situation where opportunities were few and far between.

"All I wanted to do when I started this journey was to mine bitcoins. I loved bitcoin. And somehow I got talked into getting rid of it all. And now in the end I realize that Im left with no bitcoin... Im left with no miners... The XPY I sold my miners for is now worth 1/3 of what I bought it for. The reassurance from Josh and all the users was sky high. In the end, of course I make my own decisions. But I feel like I was talked into something I wouldnt have normally done. And I dont even know how that happened. I guess I just had that much faith.
Our CEO once had faith in bitcoin. But now he has forwarded btc.com to paybase, and his comments and the comments of other users has made me feel like everyone has turned against bitcoin. Like now I have to choose between btc or xpy, and if I choose btc I'm somehow no longer on the team. At least that is what it feels like."

John furiously pecked at the computer keys, his eyes darting around the keyboard like it was his favorite Where's Waldo book. After hours of hard work, he was done. He just needed a title now. "It has to be perfect" he thought as he picked up his glass of Fresca. He tossed the entire glass of liquid  swiftly into his mouth, his entire face quivering as the bubbles hit the back of his throat. His eyes watered and stared off into space, his face continuing to quiver, slowly resonating and then escalating into a tremble. He let out a loud moan, reminiscent of the undead. His cheeks were shaking violently as his brain puzzled together the perfect set of words for his title. His eyes became wide and a slanted grin took up residence on his face as his hands typed the words, "Bitcoin won't bring major change". His nostrils flared with excitement as he fondled the mouse. Slowly and confidently he clicked the submit button and let out a loud whoop-whoop sound while his arms flailed wildly above his head. He giggled with delight and then softly whispered to himself, "I deserve another Fresca."

Heya Hand Hook Car Door! Thanks for participating :) I agree that votes arent the best way to do something like this, but I couldnt think of any other way to choose a winner fairly. I certainly dont want to have the responsibility of having to pick all on my own haha.
So I am hoping that this post will get enough **readers** upvoting their favorite stories that it will balance out the ones downvoting. I have faith that the majority of our community is too mature and respectful to downvote stories that others took time to write.
Edit: To make up for any shenanigans with the voting, I will do my best to make sure that any story that deserves a tip receives a tip. And I will also still award the "main" prizes to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place based on votes.

I'd like to know this too! 500 bits @_date: 2015-01-12 03:03:58
I am indeed, but just a little bit. I usually put around 50% of my bitcoin into litecoin, dogecoin, peercoin, namecoin, darkcoin, and a tad bit of potcoin.  With those I play on the market, selling high and then re-buying low, constantly working on increasing my supply of each. Although litecoin has been tough to "sell high" lately :(
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:43:43
That is a really good point that I had not thought of. I plan on doing this again soon, so next time I will consider setting it up like that for sure, it seems like a great way to go about it.

I mainly use hashnest.com ever since bitmain (antminer) took it over almost a year ago. Never had a problem, its not a contract service, I do think that anything that expires after X days (contracts) are usually complete junk. At hashnest the only way hashing power you buy will expire/go away is if its sold on the market, or if the price of bitcoin is too low to pay for the electricity. With antminer S5 at $225/btc I pay around 50% of my mining income for electric/maintenence. The price of btc would have to drop significanlty below 200 for it to not be profitable anymore.
I would not be using cloud services if I did not have to, I mine at home as well, but I have my electrical system at its limits so I had to expand into the cloud. Bitmain was the only company I trusted, as they made all the miners I use at home, which have been running almost a year now. I am confident enough that they are not a scam, at least in the sense that they actually are mining, I can see the proof, prices are fair, and nothing seems "too good to be true"
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:18:31
When someone "shorts" Bitcoin, its basically like they are betting on the price going down. If the price does go down, they "win" the bet and get more bitcoin. The further it drops the more they "win". The opposite of this is going "long" which is like a bet that the Bitcoin price will increase. 
Short interest, I assume, would simply mean that there are a relatively large amount of people betting on the price dropping, or that they are simply betting more than usual.

Thanks Steve, ive tried to make a "clear" introduction to Bitcoin before, and damn is it hard. I admire anyone that is able to explain it to non techy folk. 1111 bits
Edit: After listening to just the first bit of it, I felt comfortable sending this to my mom and aunt, who are both very slow when it comes to understanding technology. But I think even they will understand this, they have interest in bitcoin but most explanations go waaaay over their heads and it frustrats them. Thank you for doing this.

Well, you can add team members as friends and invite them to a race via garage&gt;race with friends, sadly you cant really race as a team against other teams, but the combined team stats do go on the team scoreboards.
