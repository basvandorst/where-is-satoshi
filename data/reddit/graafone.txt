Whatever you guys eventually choose will make its way into our LN app. (with caveats).
Personally, the S with the T through it (above LAO) looks promising, the S with one strike in Column 1, Row 2 isn't bad either.

The best practice is to use your own node.
However, mobile wallets have come a long way, certain ones like Breez, Bitcoin Lighting Wallet and Eclair are popular.
We have a short wallet guide for which ones may be easiest to use with our service here:

Thanks for the feedback!

This is why we modeled our Lightning exchange to be direct-to-wallet, no custody of Bitcoin. Only fiat.

A problem with bisq is the extremely low volume, especially on pairings like CAD.

Fairly easy to follow if you want to use lnd
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:06:19
There are definitely a few kinks to work out before LN is ready for the mainstream but the pace of development and solutions to some of the limitations is very promising.

Many of the largest exchanges will usually offer a relatively "safe" experience, however as soon as you purchase it is good practice to immediately withdraw your Bitcoin balance to your own personal wallet (where only you know the private keys).

Now we just need to get his upcoming patreon-alternative/platform to accept BTC Lightning Network payments
