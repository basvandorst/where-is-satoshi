kinda like the tesla...
all the nature nuts love these electric cars... but the carbon foot print(to get the lithium) and the devastation to the local environment where lithium is mined is ridiculous... most people don't think to consider this/look into it

agree(in regards to this)
but how does it compare to fiat currency?
I mean... 
* if you add up the electricity to print money
* the whole materials(zinc, copper, silver, trees) the cost to ship them, harvest them, etc..
* gas/diesel/carbon foot print of transporting millions of pounds of money
* cost of counterfit money on the monetary system
* etc.
I wonder how bitcoin's "cost" compares to the current model. Has anyone done a full scale comparison?

very true... idk if i would count atm's and credit cards, since some cryptos already have them/plan to have credit type cards. kind of a push there.
and yes physical banks too(sometimes necessary... banks do have good purposes and roles, just perhaps better if it were not with fiat)
