Thank you for the response. When he spends some of the funds at that address, doesn't he have to send the change somewhere else, or can he send the change back to the original address?
EDIT: I found this which may explain what I'm asking:

Only if you are cuter. Because she is cute.

"Windows version"? OpenBazaar isn't going to be on the web?
@_date: 2014-01-31 12:37:36
Aren't you supposed to switch bitcoin addresses after any spends? If so, doesn't that mean you cannot spend any money sent to that address without sacrificing security?
@_date: 2014-10-30 03:29:07
Bingo! But you said "keys". The attacker only needs a single key, the unencrypted one. Plus access to email, which may be simple if the user leaves a computer logged in (at home, for example).
If the backup key and a logged-in email client are laying around at home, a burglar may be able to steal funds without delay.

"propaganda". Please. You'd have an easier time removing whatever propaganda exists than abolishing public education entirely.

I don't get this argument. Why would it be difficult to get a warrant to hack the Silk Road server, a server that is OBVIOUSLY used for drug trade?

There are only 10,000,000 satoshis in 0.1BTC. That's not very many to go around to 7 billion people. I guess at some point the protocol could be changed to allow for smaller units of bitcoin than a satoshi to be transferred, but I'm just guessing.

Taxation as not-theft was a small to zero percent of my public education.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:16:02
No I don't know those at all. 
It's a miracle I know how to breathe then, I guess.

If one is trying to provide access to one's bitcoin to their relatives in the case of one's death, they will also need to provide passwords to decrypt the wallet. 
Emailing wallets and plaintext passwords to people, even trusted people, does not seem particularly secure since one doesn't know who may be snooping the email delivery nor who has access to their email.

Why doesn't anyone compete with GHashIO or whatever they are?
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:03:28
Well if the price doesn't go higher by December, which is a year after I bought in at the peak, then I am selling it also. I bought in once and so far I've got -25%.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:54:45
That's weird, the last time I looked the fee was like $0.25.
@_date: 2014-01-03 01:45:11
Why not?

How is a secret passphrase similar? They can hit you with a wrench to get that.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:13:25
As someone with a paper wallet who lost their BIP password for it, it's not a very good method.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:12:33
A paper wallet IS an offline wallet, according to the link you gave.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:02:09
I guess their point is: if it does go to $7500 then you missed out on the rise from $5700 to $7500. Even though you locked-in the rise to $5700.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:10:33
Doesnt the same apply to every currency? What if everyone tried to sell USD?
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:18:58


What's this? I can't just let it stay in coinbase? I don't know what the split is.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:32:24
Why not? It's deflationary. It's limited. Bitcoin will be lost. Eventually the usable supply will shrink smaller and smaller.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:16:47
I think you got that backwards. :)
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:52:40
Yes. Everyone should sell. Then when the price is zero, everyone should buy! /s
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:08:44
I'm right there with you buddy. It will go back up I think. Just picture the guy with the knuckle tattoos from "Master &amp; Commander":

Can you PLEASE explain somewhere IN DETAIL how you generated this transaction so that we can fix the software so it doesn't happen to anyone else?
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:20:19
Interesting that they don't provide a single source for the Spring/Summer being max.
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:43:59
I know this isn't the place to criticize bitcoin, but those features that proponents extol that you described (irreversible and instantaneous) actually seem to be drawbacks rather than features. Honestly, I feel like my bitcoin funds are less secure than sitting in a bank account. And I studied cryptography and security at the graduate level. I fear for a more layman person trying to use bitcoin. Also, I see no incentive to use bitcoin instead of my Visa card. My visa pays &gt;1% back and is reversible.

What does "DM us" mean?
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:48:17
I don't know. How many people does it take to get funds out of a safe deposit box? How many children or family members need to be held at gunpoint to take everything? 2? 3? I don't know what their security is and I'm not advocating or suggesting violence, I'm just trying to imagine what safeguards could be put in place to stop such a thing.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:37:46
Why do you say bitaddress.org with a pass-phrase would not "be a safe way to make them"? So far that is the safest method I have come across in my research (when run on a cold, clean pc).
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:51:48
Lovely! Might want to xpost to @_date: 2013-12-14 04:27:07
How would one setup the transaction he described, where he pays bitcoin for a website in 30 days and if it's not done, the money is reverted automatically with no third-party intervention at all?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:55:47
Are those video cards and are they even plugged in to the PCIe?
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:49:13
Bitcoin seems about as (in)secure as cash, which is not secure at all. All someone has to do is threaten the private key owner with pain or death and they're gone.
At least that's my take on it.
