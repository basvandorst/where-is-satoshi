Rigged how? Company makes their take and they could care less who wins the hand

America’s Card Room takes bitcoin.  Played plenty, cashed out winnings.  Pay is fast and their acceptance of btc is quick too.  1 verification and it’s there.
You can only cash out from 8am-midnight.
They just had 2 million dolllae guarantee tournaments.  Cash tables are ok, it’s tough action on 1/2-3/6. A few tough people that play many tables
People gamble on 5/10 and 10/20
The site seems to be legit, never had an issue and have logged 100’s of hours.
If you can stand the pressure, jump on in, the waters fine.  If you are a casual home game and some casino time player.  They will eat you up and not think twice about it.  Better gamble might be on alt coins then.
I’ve been staked a few times at some of the big tables, if interested pm me

Ok, thought it was related to value and was going to go down for some reason 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:52:16
What does that mean second stage?

There is a big sell wall, and some predictions of a correction of some sort.  It doesn’t take much to create a panic sell.  Probably not a huge one, but enough to give some alts a lift.  A lot of alts are poised to make a bit of a jump.  Hopefully you’ll get back what they declined a fair amount more.  
What did you buy? Curious

Think it’ll run up some more before the split?

Good article, thank you for that.  Looks like as long as gov't has their hand firmly in the cookie jar then its ok

Funny how thoughts are limited, kind of doing people a disservice by not allowing all possibilities to be expressed, you know, with free speech and all that

What isn’t risky on wall street and is without crazy fees and less control, or fake news?

I responded in a thread to a few comments with Bitcoin having better returns, can’t wait to see what happens.  Just stirring their pot
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:09:03
I’m sure there are plenty of posts for long shot opportunities

Reminds  me to set my stop losses

Currently no real tax enforcement from what I’ve read, a very small percentage claimed it last year. I’ve also read exposure to issues is based on what exchange you use.    Probably won’t last forever but as of now....
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:40:33
Thanks lol, btc at 6200 now
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:03:45
Also great for brokers and wallstreet

Looks like 07 mines.  So that’s that.  Looked outside for the Alts to moon, didn’t see anything, but it’s dark out
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:04:24
Sounds like mod over there is a full time job
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:42:53
Good point
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:39:30
Because the stock market is not risk lol.
Cd no risk and really no reward
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:10:46
Doesn’t have to be all in, but most markets have had crashes in the past

Just got a 10 day ban for recommending bitcoin as an option in a post
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:30:09
I think that with a lot of news, however this a fairly strong regulatory decision.  There were some threats of poker sites getting shut down before the April 15, 2011.  Money was able to be withdrawn after some time, but that was all USD, not a currency that can lose value. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:06:12
Yup, I know a lot of money managers that have lost plenty of money.
Edit: other people’s money
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:18:24
Why regret, gains are gains at any level.  Losses are losses.  And volatility happens in any market.
Less commissions and not all stock brokers are winners
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:29:02
Ok, that’s a good point 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:11:47
They say, ‘it’s the rules’
Reminds me of the movie the cube, where the machine was made by different people and not knowing fully what was going on
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:57:08
Can’t give all the personal finance options in there.  Wonder if you sandwiched it in if that would work? I’ll try after my ban is over.  “What should I do with my money?”
I’ll say something like, man cd’s do good, maybe stocks or bonds, maybe invest in a kickstarter, maybe try that new thing called bite coin or bit coin I heard about on some msnbc money show.  Wonder if that gets a ban
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:05:02
That post was banned too
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:00:49
Buy low!
