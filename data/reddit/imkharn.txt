Xapo is not able to ship cards to the USA, so if you want Bitcoin debit card in the USA i believe nanocard is the only option.
Nanocard does cost more but the main fee difference once you have the card is purchases. Xapo is free, while nanocard charges about 1% + ~50 cents. Since you have to spend the 1% anyway in the USA when converting from Bitcoin to Dollars, ultimately you are losing the 50 cents per transaction.
To sum it all up in the USA if you want to be able to spend your money using a debit card, you now have the option to lose a few dollars a month to ccedk but gain the ability to store your debit card spending money in bitcoin instead of fiat with a bank. Catch is yearly limit of money that flows through the card is about 300 USD due to Financial Action Task Force laws.

Sure 180 million dollars a day is 9 times the upkeep cost of all google data centers combined. 
Sure. Here are the 3 assumptions you seem to have off.
1) Unlike currently where a large portion goes to electricity, in a large price increase most money will be frantically spent on new hardware because of the rate it pays off. Demand will greatly outpace supply and the cost of bitcoin mining hardware will be massive until manufacturing can catch up. 
2) During a price run up that 180 million a day would not represent costs, it would be largely profit until manufacturing of ASICs catches up with the bitcoin price.
3) Next you will likely say "But I wasnt talking about the temporary period right after the price shoots up, I am talking about the prospects of staying at 100K per coin long term"  Ok in that case, by then the ASICs production will have caught up and would have the difficulty of mining a coin. ASICs would be everywhere in everything, and there would be so much money flooding into the industry that new improved hardware would much much more frequently be released. Bitcoin already has more computing power than any super computer, the cost of running the network now should already seem incredible. In a world where bitcoin is used by 500 times as many people sure, there will be 500 times as much mining.

Play on the side of caution then. Only put in 100-200 dollars. It will either be worth nothing or a excessively large amount within 3-7 years. Because of the scale to which it can expand you only need a small amount to get a ticket on the train.
Even if you don't have 100 dollars spare, you can still use bitcoin to save money. Do the math and find out what a 2% raise, or a 5% raise at your job would get you.
Using gyft.com (3% cash back) and brawker.com (7% cash back) for all expenses is the same as a several percent raise at work. This could be a couple hundred dollars a month.

I explained why this is not true in the OP yet you managed to type out this reply anyway. I guess ill expand further.
Inflation and deflation only have to do with price, which should make your mining statement irrelevant as your plan to mine supernovas for gold but it holds its relevance because we are actually talking about inherent inflation/deflation.
When something is declared inflationary or deflationary they are talking about the aspects of the thing, not about how its price is doing lately despite the literal translation. More specifically the aspects of the thing that inherently cause its price to go up and down.
All goods are inherently inflationary by the amount per year the supply increases, and all goods are deflationary by the amount per year the number of people buying goods in general increases plus the amount per year the buying power of people in general increases.
If you look at the last 10 years the inherent inflation rate of gold is 0.9% and the inherent deflation rate of gold is 4.8%. This means that all other variables held constant the price of gold will rise on its own by 3.9% per year just from economic growth, mining, and population growth. Gold is inherently deflationary as long as you agree that humans inherently have technological advances and population growth. Even if you just look at population growth, the number of gold ounces per human on earth is always decreasing.

Not quite true. The [top post]( is software already made that mostly does this.
It has binding votes and non binding votes. You have to be voted in to become a member with actual voting powers. Otherwise your votes are just for consideration.
Granted some outside force of as little as one person with some funding could slowly infiltrate a target community and then once it has enough people voted in as members be able to freely bring additional voting power into the organization and overtake it.
To solve this I think someones voting power should be equivalent to the amount of money the decentralized organization has paid them so far for all work done. Either that, or only people who have made more than a certain physical contribution to the project can vote.

Dollars are a form of largely electronic money used through a centralized bank network with no oversight or auditing. The currency relies on a network of computers that records details of transactions.
Dollars are risky investments due to the lack of inherent usefulness or bullion backing and the [frequency of the collapse of even world reserve fiat currencies]( They are the most useful and widely used method for funding illegal activity. Also, dollars, like all currencies including bitcoin do not have a fixed value, which means one has to look at exchange rates to quote the value.
Our firm's investment philosophy is to use high quality securities (like silver, gold, and TIPS - treasury inflation protected securities) to meet long-term financial goals, rather than investment instruments whose value is driven by speculative activities, like stocks.

M3 is the real money base, not M2 like this chart shows. (M4 is the only step up from that and includes unfunded government loans, but is far too secretive to have any info on)
I researched this a lot many months ago so I have some knowledge here.
The federal reserve stopped sharing the M3 inflation in 2006. Right up until 2006 the inflation was climbing faster and faster. It was last seen at 11%.
You are not seeing 11% decrease in purchasing power because the useage of the dollar is increasing due to economic growth and population growth. This comes out to about 4.5%. Then factor in the ~3% inflation that is actually being felt, and it leaves about 3% of the money created being hoarded by either the federal reserve or the institutions they give money to.
Personally I am assuming they stopped sharing because it went above 11%, none the less even if you imagine it stayed at 11% after they stopped reporting, the dollar is still over valued by 23% due to hoarded money. It was this discovery that had me move my IRA into Treasury inflation protected securities.

How does yelp get revenue?

Yelp free version has ads on your page, yelp paid version removes the ads off your page. This is where over 80% of the income comes from is local businesses. 
Now naturally the ads would be something a yelp user considering a restaurant would want, higher rated restaurants nearby that sell the same type of food.
Sure in the end, from the perspective of a business, they are being told unless they pay up, yelp will attempt to direct all their customers to competitors.
To me this is not quite extortion. Showing useful ads to users of the site is the default way the site works. It has to be a threat to start harming someone to count as extortion.
If someone lets someone else use their billboard for free and gives them a little space on that billboard, how is it extortion to put up competitors ads on the same billboard? Am I missing something?

| Transaction   | x^0.5 * 5% fee   | 0.2% fee     | 0.5% fee     |
| $10           |   $0.16 (1.6%)     |    $0.02      | $0.05  
| $50         |   $0.35 (0.7%)     |   $0.10        | $0.25    
| $100         |   $0.50 (0.5%)     |   $0.20        | $0.50    
| $500         |   $1.12 (0.22%)     |   $1.00        | $2.50  
| $1000       |   $1.58  (0.16%)     |   $2.00     | $5.00    
| $10,000       |   $5.00  (0.05%)      |   $20.00       | $50.00  
| $100,000       |   $16.00  (0.016%)     |   $200.00       | $500.00  
I am not sure why more organizations do not do this, I have always guessed its harder to advertise a fee with more than one math step.

The deflationary situations you are talking about are caused by unbacked fiat currency.  This is extreme deflation where there literally isn't enough money to do  a large portion of transactions and was caused by the banking institutions. Deflation itself is not bad, rapid changes to the foundation of an economy are and will always be.
"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered." - Thomas Jefferson

Yes a quantum bit does double the computing power.
 In general, a quantum computer with n qubits can be in an arbitrary superposition of up to 2^n different states simultaneously
Each qubit utilized could take a superposition of both 0 and 1. Thus, the number of computations that a quantum computer could undertake is 2^n, where n is the number of qubits used. A quantum computer comprised of 500 qubits would have a potential to do 2^500 calculations in a single step. 


Quantum computers are only faster at certain types of functions usually ones that require brute force by conventional computers, so   The moment something it is profitable to do, someone will do it. And since you are wrong about how fast quantum computing power will grow, you are underestimating how easy it would be.
Remember the posts on about how you would need a computer the size of the entire universe to crack bitcoin?
Well, a 300 qubit computer can crack some incredible problems:
"The projected performance of this new experimental quantum simulator eclipses the current maximum capacity of any known computer by an astonishing 10 to the power of 80. That is 1 followed by 80 zeros, in other words 80 orders of magnitude, a truly mind-boggling scale," Dr Michael Biercuk, at the University of Sydney, said. "[It] has the potential to perform calculations that would require a supercomputer larger than the size of the known universe - and it does it all in a diameter of less than a millimetre." 
And finally since you mentioned the NSA first
Documents leaked by Edward Snowden confirm the Penetrating Hard Targets project,[151] by which the NSA seeks to develop a quantum computing capability for cryptography purposes.[152][153][154]

Companies are kinda like life in general though, if their life is on the line, they will adapt and sacrifice as much as needed even if it means scraping by. 
For example. Here is my competition plan if advising Amazon:
* Focus on drone deliveries. OB cant deliver products 30 minutes after ordering, and customers will pay more for this. Drones are economy of scale and Amazons existing capital and market position will allow it to be capitalized on additionally. 
* Lobby for laws that make OB business more difficult. Argue that since the commerce is hidden, its possible for it to be financial, and require sellers over 10K of transactions to follow know your customer anti money launder laws. This wont stop grey and black market, or large sellers, but will stop small and hinder medium sellers. Also lobby for laws that try to licence online commerce. 
* Increase investment in UI. Amazon has plenty of spending available for overhead to ensure UI and mobile experience is superior to OB.
* Expand delivery of refrigerated items which OB is unable to ship.
* Amazon seller fee is 15%. OB sellers cut varies, but will likely be pushed lower than amazon by competition. Monitor for under cut prices on OB and offer subscribe and save for these item on Amazon. In fact, expand subscribe and save in general. Use it to further lean prices in favor of customers who do not shop around and clearly use Amazon as their primary source. Subscribe&amp;Save items also have lower shipping costs per item than OB is capable of.
* Introduce bitcoin as a payment method on Amazon, and offer 5% discount. This is more than saved by credit card fees, but overkill is needed to combat the tendency of customers who prefer bitcoin from using OB.
* Introduce another amazon credit card marketed towards Bitcoin users. Only allow the card to be paid off with bitcoin. Unlike the existing amazon credit card which offers 5% off, this will combine both discounts amounting to a 10% discount with this card. Make it so the the discount is 5% for the first 100 dollars spent on amazon in a month, and 10% after that to help encourage Amazon as a single source. Make the points kickback as Amazon credit instead of cash to keep the rebates internal.

"What is Bitcoin?"
Bitcoin is the most established format for decentralized Crypto-currency trade. This technology is where the inherent value is.
Decentralized Crypto-currency is the technology that removes the need for banks in the world. Money is kept completely with the people and used by the people. When doing trade both parties get to keep all the money the banking system would charge. Ultimately, this lowers the cost of doing business for anyone participating by around 3% and twice that if it is used by the wholesale suppliers also.  Lowering the cost of doing business by 3-6% in a world operates on an 11% average profit margin, gives the technology a whole lot of inherent value!
Bitcoin can be sent to anyone essentially for free, it is infinitely divisible, it inherently gains value each year instead of losing 2% like it would to the federal reserve, it can not be seized by governments, it can not be counterfeited, it can be sent to anyone worldwide in minutes.....  In short, it is better than cash in every single way... save its prevalence which is expanding.

With the US dollar when banks lend out money they don't have they are actually creating more currency.
Since one can't create more bitcoin on demand, the closest bitcoin banks can come is giving out IOUs. If the company is trustworthy enough the public will accept these IOUs to be as good as the bitcoin since the bank says they will pay.
Historically the early banks were able to keep IOUs in circulation because IOUs were much more portable and tradeable than gold, metals and goods. In the internet age there is no such advantage and everyone would just trade IOUs for actual bitcoin upon first chance they get.
For the first time in the history of banks IOUs are less useful than actual money because the actual money is actually more portable and more secure than the IOUs are.

Bitcoin wiki and economists disagree with you. Backing means backed by something physical. Dollar has not been backed since the 70s. If the dollar loses value or crashes to nothing the US government will not reimburse you. Additionally the US government requiring businesses to accept dollars and accepting dollars for taxes does not affect the value more than a tiny amount. Think about it... if the ONLY reason people wanted dollars was because of the US government, they would simply use other better currencies and only switch to dollars in order to make required trades and taxes. If people are not holding on to dollars they dont have value. US government does not force people to hold on to dollars, only to accept it.


Quantitative Easing is an extremely small part (80 billion) of the increase of money supply, it is mostly from fractional reserve banking and loans from the federal reserve to banks. If the number of dollars in existence increases by 10% a year each dollar by definition is worth 10% less. The rate it is being traded at currently wont be effected though unless that money makes it to the general public. It doesn't change that the dollars now exist and could enter the market in the future devaluing the currency.


Eh, I skimmed the article, I mostly just grabbed an article to fit the theme of the response, don't look into it too much. You shouldn't plug your ears to anyone, just be more skeptical of some. 80% of dollars are not in the USA so if the world transitions away from using the dollar as the reserve currency the dollar will collapse. This can happen quickly.. if just a few countries ditch or dump their dollars the value will suddenly drop which pressures more nations to do the same. This does not speak as to when it will happen, only that it could happen at any time.

At first I agreed with you..and I sorta did when I made this poll. All the posts about switching were backed up by people claiming more people will like bitcoins if we call them millibitcoins because they think a bitcoin is too expensive and will avoid Bitcoin all together never realizing that it is divisible. 
This is still an unfounded reason in my view, however as almost all transactions in the world are done in amounts much less than $1000 having most every transaction starting with 0.0 is stupid in the same way every number on a Yugioh card having 2 extra zeros on the end.
Basically I support use of a smaller denomination because I and likely others would hate writing 0.0000234 when buying a doughnut or whatever in the future. To me its about the number of digits people have to write down as the most important factor.
A satoshi is already down to 1000 per US cent.

Solution to NSA/GCHQ soon to begin adjusting traffic into crafted patterns of volume over time is to update tor to include a loose checksum of the shape of the traffic at the start and compare it to the end with a threshold to detect significant modification. 
This would force supercomputers/quantum computers to be used to shape traffic undetectably at a speed fast enough to run a popular tor node.
As for the partial fix for cross referencing time a website was accessed and comparing to the time of tor traffic in suspected locations. Tor clients should include a "extra secure" mode where traffic is delayed a random amount of time before being sent at each tor node. Slower average ping, many times longer list of people that can be narrowed down to.

Some pessimistic math on the Jalepeno.
If you could magically make the the 300 dollar Jalepeno appear on your deck right now, it would yield 1000 dollars a month.
However, It will be ~4 months by the time the Jalepeno arrives if you order now.
They are ~100 times more productive than a good graphics card, and lets say 50% of the market is replaced by the Jalepeno and competitors in the next 6 months. 
Now we are down to 20 dollars a month.
Also the difficulty will increase. Lets guess 5x difficulty half a year from now.
Now we are down to 4 dollars a month.
Lets not forget moores law...computers will be 19-41 percent better by then.
Now we are down to 3 dollars a month.

I agree. There just isn't enough news or never discussed before discussion each day to take a full 100% of this subreddit.
Banning memes does not make a community come up with original discussion ideas faster and it wont increase the amount of interesting Bitcoin news happening in the world.
You can not make a subreddit better by banning on topic content unless that content is so ruthlessly taking over the subreddit that people are giving up submitting discussion and news articles. r/bitcoin is far from that point.

Look at it this way. You run their company and can produce these devices for 1000 each, and they each yield you 1000 a month. You are about to buy all that you possibly can and max out your credit cards.
Then you realize 2 things. 
If you were to mass produce them for sales this would lower the cost per unit and you could buy them for yourself much cheaper allowing you to make many times more money.
Additionally, you can mark up the ones you are selling from what they cost you and make even MORE money.

**Urgent Warning on Dollars**
At least bitcoin has a technology behind it that has intrinsic value. It can lower costs of doing business in a way nothing else on earth can. A far cry from something like gold or silver, Dollar has no tangible backing of any kind and relies purely on persuading others to hand over things of value in exchange for electronic entries. 
Heavy creation by certain banks has helped fuel an approximate 2% increase in the M3 money supply of Dollar in the past 2 months. When inflation catches up, the drop could be more dramatic.
The situation reminds us of any other fiat currency you occasionally see promoted. Yes speculators can jump in, get out, and be guaranteed to lose some real money to inflation. But eventually many will lose most or all of their investment -- depending on which particular day they act on the inevitable "loss of world reserve status"
If you are considering putting one thin satoshi into Dollar, [please get the facts]( first. *Caveat emptor!*

The only reasons Deflation is a problem is:
**Hoarding -** This happens when people refuse to spend their money because its wiser to save it. And this is only an issue when its known each day that the day after your currency will be worth more. This happened in the past because governments or banks intentionally pulled money out of the system at either a constant rate or usually a sudden large amount all at once. It also happened when cartels controlling the gold trade would do what the diamond trade does and control the supply to artificially raise prices. None of these happen with Bitcoin because no single entity controls all mining, nor can anyone control the production.
Bitcoin has a slight natural tendency to go up in the long run because people lose their money, and this only begins many years from now when the other half of the bitcoin are done being mined. At least for the next 20 years or so, bitcoin is inherently inflationary anyway. The only reason it is rising in value currently is an increasing number of people are trying to buy it.
Bitcoin goes up and down in value each day in an unpredictable manner, this means any hoarding is short term not long term because they wait until a price hike to buy things rather than forever.
Finally since the 1930s hoarding is much less of an issue because it is easy for the common person to invest the money keeping it in the economy even if they are saving it instead of spending, removing the primary downside effect of hoarding, money being kept off the market lowering economic activity for the civilization.
**Difficulty of trade :** This happened at least once in Americas history when so much money was pulled out of the economy that the average dollars owned per person was just over 6 dollars. This is an issue because its hard to trade when denominations of physical money don't go small enough. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible so there is no difficulty of trade if the value of 1.0 coins because super huge.

1) Take a loan and buy a quantum computer and use it to instantly mine the remaining 11 million blocks.
2) Start informing the world that BTC has been hacked and that is why the value is plummeting, people will generally believe the rumor (for a while at least) and in sell sell sell.
3) The value of BTC will be a fraction of what it was earlier. Now, use all the money you made flooding the market to buy as many BTC as possible.
4) Once you have acquired as much BTC as you can get your hands on, prove to the world that you mined it all with a quantum computer and no hack actually happened.
5) Faith in BTC will return and the value will skyrocket back up to about half of what it was before step 1. Pay off the loan you used to buy the quantum computer.

Crypto currency has intrinsic value because it lowers the financial cost of doing business to near zero saving merchants in the world an average of 3% per transaction. A huge deal when average corporate profit margins are 11%. This is immense intrinsic value alone, and its ability to keep track of ownership free of cost and not lose its value to money supply increases take it even further.

I find it better to estimate the lowest reasonable value rather than the highest reasonable value.
For imagining value in the future, I would include all the reductions. Since the author already assumed BTC would only be used in off record transactions, ill leave that off as a reduction.
25% of the off record market (going with 25% because BTC is better in every way than the alternatives for off record)
50% of cryptocurrency market
66% of business fail. Should assume to apply here too. (other cryptocurrency could become dominate)

In order for it to succeed on a massive scale it has to come face to face with the largest banking power on the planet, the federal reserve. The federal reserves power comes solely from the authorization to devalue the dollar and appropriate the resulting funds for secret spending and to set interest rates.
Bitcoin succeeding also means this superpower would have to lose those powers...all the power. People already tried to switch off the dollar taking that power away once already in the last century, and the response was making the personal ownership of gold illegal for decades. If everyone switches to gold, the politicians and federal reserve lobbyists argued, the economy will collapse.
Why do you think this will not happen again?

It is decentralized so the only thing you can DDOS is the transaction verification system.
The verification system can only be DDOSed by sending tiny transactions around in huge volumes.
This is not an issue because BTC network processes transactions that paid a fee before ones that did not.
It would cost the DDOSer way too much money to DDOS BTC, and the only harm that would come of it is people having to include fees in their transactions to skip the infinite wait.

Russia's official inflation rate set by the cost of a set basket of goods is at 6% annually, double that of the USA. However the total money supply (M3) growth rate is much more telling of an indicator when looking at the future of a currency since this is the expansion of the actual supply regardless of how much its purchasing currently.
US money supply M3 inflation rate was growing yearly until 2006 when it hit 10%. Since then the Federal Reserve has refused to tell how much money is being created yearly. Whatever it is, its very above the consumer inflation rate and I can only assume its being stockpiled or has not 'trickled down' from the banks yet to the people.
It appears hard to find data on Russias M3 money supply growth per year, but month to month M2 is growing by over 1%. With M3 growing even faster it seems the Ruble is not a very safe currency either.
However each citizen in Russia is only $1,426 in debt due to the Russian government totaling 13% of GDP. The united states is $54,680 per citizen with a total of 108% of GDP. This means that while the Ruble is likely digging a hole faster, the dollar has a huge head start.
Additionally, 80% of US dollars are overseas and 50% of the worlds trade is done in dollars whereas Rubles are mostly local currency. This means the dollar can also have a collapse simply by the world transitioning away from it, as opposed to collapsing because interest can no longer be paid from over expansion of the supply.

Gold was outlawed in the USA in 1933 officially termed "trading with the enemy" because at the time it was destroying the value of the dollar as people in mass were abandoning the dollar. The price of gold did a quick reaction drop, then continued to rise the year after the ban to higher than before the ban. Other countries simply continued to use it and eventually in 1970s it was legalized again.
Since Bitcoin doesn't have thousands of years of history,  I would expect the initial drop to be much much stronger, the price rise to be less, and because it is technology in much more rapidly changing world, the re-legalization to be much much quicker.

The Federal Reserve has to like Bitcoin for the main banks to like Bitcoin. The main banks get to loan out 10 times what they actually have in assets due to money handed out by the Fed.

Why would it increase? ... I guess it increases naturally so at the very least explain why it would not drop the value?
The last time the dollar started to collapse, it was because everyone was switching to gold, so the Federal government banned ownership of gold unless you had a license and it worked.
In 1933 Executive Order 6102 owning gold was officially deemed "trading with the enemy" and every citizen was forced to sell all gold they owned directly to the Federal Reserve bank.
The value of gold went up by 30% over the next year, so that's something to stand on.

If you look at the blockchain, every person who has a coinbase account actually has that money tied to that address.  The very same address you can withdraw from in the standard bitcoin transaction time.
If the funds someone actually withdraws starts in a holding account, you would see the holding account transfer to the users wallet, then to wherever the user was sending. However no such history shows up.

Going to address this one:
Volatility as a problem.
1) The more it grows in use the more stable it will be. Due in part because it will be harder for a small number of speculators to have an influential part of the market.
As the value goes up and down, people wait to purchase good until it is at a high point. Everyone including the merchants receiving the BTC, will have an increased tendency to turn BTC into other stores of value bringing the price back down. When BTC is low in value people save their BTC and compete more over purchasing them which raises the price back up again. It is self stabilizing for this reason, and how much so is determined by the growth of people holding BTC for primarily merchant purposes.  
2) If people really have fear of their BTC gaining and losing value, and having to save money and buy things they want at the right time, there are bitcoin banks already created that guarantee a stable price for a small fee. ( a fee mind you that is smaller than bank transaction fees and federal reserve devaluing your money so we are still in the better than the dollar camp when it comes to the cost of stability.)
