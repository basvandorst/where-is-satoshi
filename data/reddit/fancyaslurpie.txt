I'd rather they didn't allow editing of their git history as it makes it too easy to abuse. They clearly have some issues with their process though if you can merge untested code in(otherwise they'd have noticed this bad merge).

You realise if you invest 10k at 28 and 10k at 19k you lose far more in the first situation if it goes to 2?

Which isn't what he said he did.

Ah ok, yes that would be the cleanest, although sometimes it's good to own up to your fuckups :p stops me doing it again atleast.

Can you predict how much 1 BTC will be worth in a year's time? Part of the definition of a store of value is being able to predict it's usefulness at a later time(e.g. what you'll be able to buy with it) there's a reason gold is used and it's because it's price doesn't have large swings up and down.

The example was if bitcoin crashed down to nothing but they kept holding regardless, they would then be saying that and looking foolish.

It's not a store of value either. If i put $100 into BTC there's no guessing how much that will be in two days time. Recently it's meant you would have more than 100 (yay), but that's missing the point. The reason gold works as a store of value is its value doesn't change a huge amount up or down. There's no way I would get a loan(e.g. mortgage on a house) in btc, from both a borrowing and lending perspective it's too volatile.

People definitely went to prison for fixing the libor rates, just a quick Google shows one got sentenced to 14 years, and there's quite a few others on that page.

Most people don't have a whole BTC.
