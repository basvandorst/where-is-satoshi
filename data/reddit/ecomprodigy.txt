Time out. Seriously though, can we actually do this and get away with it?
Asking for a friend... (:

fine I'll only get the Huracan and not the Aventador
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:09:22
Yeah but the price isn't at $3k right now. I don't know how you expect me to purchase a full Bitcoin for $3000 when the current price is $9402 at the time of writing.

Edit$ $9500 a minute later WTF IS GOING ON

Not being sarcastic. I actually did just buy my first full bitcoin. So far so good.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:02:11
Oh ya mr krabs
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:30:35
You don't understand my point
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:23:56
that's retarded. it matters a lot. Example:
Let's say you want to invest $4.5k into Bitcoin.
Person A: Buys BTC at a price of $7,000 (he has 0.642 BTC)
Person B: Buys BTC at a price of $10,000 (he has 0.45 BTC)
And let's also say that in a few years, BTC reached $100,000.
Person A's portfolio is now worth $64,200.
Person B'S portfolio is now worth $45,000.
It's a pretty big difference if you ask me.
