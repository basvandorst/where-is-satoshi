Even for lightning to work the block size needs to go up significantly. I think the blockstream paid devs are worried users will realize lightning isn't really necessary if they raise the limit too soon and in the meantime they're trying to hack together SW to kick the can down the road a little longer. They keep saying these will fix everything but they aren't even close to being ready for deployment. At the same time blocks are getting full. Transactions are being delayed. Mining is already dangerously centralized in China and they are bending over backwards to make mining easier for them. Having 60% of mining power in a totalitarian communist state that has been hostile towards bitcoin in the past is a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2015-12-29 04:03:05
Makes it more difficult. Instead of just buying up a bunch of coins they have to buy hardware, space for the hardware, people to run the hardware, etc to do something nefarious. Normal miners have incentives to keep bitcoin working in the most efficient way to support users.

Mt. Gox has been crap since before 2012. Anyone who did a modicum of research could have read the horror stories. Instead they didn't bother and just went, "I've heard of them," and signed up ignoring the risks. I've never had issues with BitPay. I send them coins and it confirms right away. This sounds like you went to a place that didn't have it set up right and you're trying to blame bitcoin for that. Yes bitcoin is new and isn't perfect but it does work regardless of whether some people can't be bothered to read.

The value won't go up unless there are places to using bitcoin. Why would someone like Amazon start accepting bitcoin if they know no one will use it because they are holding. Your bitcoins only have value now because people have been using them and showing people that there is more to them than nerds holding some bits on a hard drive. That 10000 btc pizza did more for bitcoin than you and your coins sitting on a thumbdrive.
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:10:29
We already have an oligarchy. If bitcoin changes that to an oligarchy made up of nerds instead of the current crop I'd still count that as an improvement. I don't think it will though because stuff will get spread out more as the number of users increases.

In a few months once all these issues are finally ironed out things will recover and people will be kicking themselves for bailing like they do every time it drops.

That's ok. Sorry if I was insulting. A new block of transactions are confirmed on average of every 10 minutes. These are added to the blockchain. Once a transaction is added to the chain it gets another confirmation every time another block is found. That's what mining does. It confirms the transactions and sticks them in the blockchain so everyone knows what coins are where so they can't be double spent or faked.

How much is reddit gold? Instead of buying gold for someone give them enough bits to buy it themselves and explain how to do it. Then they can see how it works and actually use it to buy something. Having .001 BTC is weird to noobs. Having some BTC then immediately turning it into reddit gold might convince some stubborn people that it can actually be useful and easy.

Coinbase hasn't been a big pile of shit the entire time like Gox. They have the majority in cold storage and it's actual cold storage. Not that hot cold wallet bullshit excuse Gox claimed was the problem. Holding onto your own coins is always the best practice but Coinbase is good enough for reasonable amounts until they are sure they can hold their own securely.

No fault of their own? Gox had been crap for a long time. Its failure was only a matter of when. They chose to keep all their coins in one place. They also chose to invest more than they could afford to lose. Other people don't use 2fa or download crap that gets their computer infected. Don't tell me it wasn't their fault. Find me someone who was beat over the head with a wrench until they gave up their coins and then I would agree that wasn't their fault.
Edit: I'm not saying Gox/Mark shouldn't be punished but you can't lay all the blame on them when their users had plenty of warning.

Long term is how to invest. People in it trying to become rich in a few months always end up getting burned twice. Once when the price drops and they freak out.

The law needs to start actually accepting bitcoin as money. They can tax it legally but see how much help you get if you go to the police and tell them someone stole $30,000 worth of bitcoin from you. They'll either laugh at you or give you a blank stare. That is something that needs to change.
Education is another issue. There is lots of info about how to secure and safely use your bitcoins but people are lazy. You also only have to do tech support for a little while to realize just how little most people know about computers. Until you can make bitcoin idiot proof losses and thefts are going to continue.
Think about how many times in history people have committed fraud to gain money in the past. There's now an entirely new way to steal money now. Lots of money. It's the wild west here. People need to be aware of the risks and know how to protect themselves. Don't be greedy. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. If you don't have the coins in a wallet only you control you don't really have those coins and they can be gone at any moment. If you do leave coins with a third party make sure you know who they are and what their track record is. Don't keep all your eggs in one basket. Backup regularly. Use cold storage for large amounts.

It's the first of it's kind. Of course this is an experiment. Nothing like this has ever been done before so no one can see what the outcome will be. Looking at the evidence and personal experience tells me that it will most likely be a successful experiment but nobody can tell you what may be coming in the years to come. It's exciting and people taking chances are how great things come to be. I don't think we've even begun to scratch the surface of how valuable the blockchain idea is. The more people get involved the greater the chance that some inquisitive mind will come up with a game changing use for it that hasn't even been imagined yet. It's open and free and the whole world has a chance to put their mark on it. Exciting times.

Since you're being dense I'll try to explain this in a way you might understand. You wouldn't carry $100,000 in cash on your person while walking around unless you're an idiot. You only carry what you might need because it could easily be stolen and you don't want to lose your $100,000. The rest you keep in a safe place. Be it a safe or a bank. Cold storage would be like a safe or a bank vault. Keeping $100,000 worth of bitcoin in a hot wallet is like walking through a bad neighborhood with all that cash on you. The internet is a very shady neighborhood.

Snowden said the government has a record of every conversation you've ever had. Maher took this as EVERY conversation and not just the online ones Snowden was talking about. He's quick to jump on a joke without realizing what he's ridiculing isn't true or the point that was trying to be made. He's also getting older and new fangled things are scary and confusing. They mentioned bitcoin on his show a while back and everyone just laughed. It's like when computers or internet came out. It's just a toy for nerds who live in their mom's basement.

Yes. Everything with Mt Gox has probably been a scam since they got hacked in 2011 and started operating on fractional reserve. Wire transfer issues started a run on bitcoins they did have and they decided to run off with what was left. The transaction malleability issue was a perfect scapegoat to throw people off the trail. Things haven't been going well with all the investigations and lawsuit threats and now they are hoping these 200000 coins will be enough to buy desperate people off so they can disappear with the rest of the coins.

2011 was a turning point. A turning point where I promised to never touch them with a 10ft pole. It's absolutely astounding there are so many people who even considered giving them money since then. That thread with people saying they had thousands of BTC in Gox that are gone now boggles my mind. How do people with so much money not do a modicum of research or use cold storage? I don't fucking understand it and I'm finding it very hard to have any sympathy for them.
"I threw my money down a hole and now it's all gone!"
"Well, that was a fucking stupid thing to do. Why did you throw your money down a hole?"

You're entirely missing the point. Bitcoin is an experiment. Nothing like this has ever been done before. Problems come up and are fixed as they are discovered. If you're under the impression that bitcoin is perfect then you're being ignorant. This is entirely new territory. People are building tools as needed but none of them are perfect either. Some are better at certain things and some have things others lack. As things go on new features and better interfaces come about. I'm glad some people think it's a joke because they shouldn't even be using it yet. It's better that they laugh now instead of doing something dumb and getting burnt because they weren't a millionaire after a month.
Also, this is about the core wallet. Most new users would more likely be using something like Coinbase on their phones and don't even know what a blockchain is. What's great about bitcoin is that they don't need to unless they want to.

I agree with you that more needs to be done to make it simpler. That is being worked on. However, if someone had a significant amount of bitcoin it would be worth their time to educate themselves on how to keep it safe. It's really not super complicated. I wouldn't tell anyone it would be a good idea to buy a lot of bitcoin if they don't know how it works and can't be bothered to teach themselves. That's just asking for trouble. That's also why things like a bitcoin ETF are exciting because it would be a way for people that can't be bothered to get into bitcoin without having to be a "super genius computer hacker nerd".

What about the people that had everything on Gox and used it like a bank? Did they not understand the risk or did they just ignore it? Do they not know how cold storage works and did they actively make a decision to not bother learning? With how much money these people are claiming they lost you'd think they'd take it more seriously or even hire someone to show them how to set it up.

A ponzi assumes there isn't any actual thing being invested in besides the ponzi itself. Money coming in is immediately paid out to keep it going until the number of people being paid out outnumbers the new coming in. Bitcoin is a thing. It's the fastest, easiest, and most secure way to move money without a middleman anywhere in the world ever invented. There's no scheduled payouts and if new people stopped coming in the price would actually stabilize at whatever the current users think is fair.

From what? Showing everyone what a great idea it is. I've been involved with bitcoin for a few years now and pretty much every crash I've seen has involved Mt. Gox somehow. Their inability to handle DDOS attacks. Their website lagging terribly. Coins disappearing. Dollars being seized. Their failing to file paperwork properly. Their current blaming of the bitcoin protocol to cover their sorry asses. There are always people saying bitcoin is dumb and will fail and these claims always accelerate when Mt. Gox is Goxxing again. Their unprofessionalism and total incompetency has been responsible for a lot of people dismissing bitcoin because all they see are problems and instability. The majority of this instability has been directly caused by the actions or lack thereof by Mt. Gox. Bitcoin works. It is a great invention and will change the way people think about how we handle the construct of money. The hard part is showing people why it works and why it will change the financial landscape. This becomes even more difficult when you have to deal with crisis after crisis caused by this one entity. Mt. Gox will die but bitcoin will carry on because honey badger don't care.

- Lying about welfare work requirements.
- He said we should stop worrying about losing our freedoms if we get attacked again.
- He said loaning money to minorities is a disaster.
- He said Fox News covered the early Tea Party protests just as much as they did the Million Man March even though Fox didn't exist back then.
- He thinks cold weather proves climate change doesn't exist.
- He lied about Iraq war protesters denting Bush's Presidential limo.
- When Rick Perry said the Wall Street bailouts were a bad idea he said he sounded like an Occupy Wall Street protester.
- He called people who were against invading Iraq sickening.
Who is he shilling for? The GOP, just like everyone at Fox News. He yells over people and cuts their mics if they aren't saying things he agrees with.

You would still be able to ask for a refund.
Bitcoin fees are lower.
Exchanges aren't banks. Online wallets are not banks. Bitcoin is about being in control of your money. If you are trusting third parties to hold all of your money you are doing it wrong. Think of cold storage as your bank and your regular wallet like a regular wallet.
If your debit card gets stolen or skimmed they can empty your account. Credit cards offer more consumer protection but that is paid for with high fees. Even then a card isn't very secure. Look at Target.
Bitcoin ATMs are actually exchanges and not ATMs like you're used to. Normal ATMs are for getting cash you already have out of your account. Why would you need to get bitcoins out of an ATM when you already have them in your wallet?
I would trust bitcoin's cryptography over some credit card company's security that was built by the lowest bidder any day.

Anyone who knows how to use Google could read the Gox horror stories. It's like having a bunch of people saying don't let that crack addict hold your wallet and you being surprised when that person steals your wallet. Yes that person stole from you and broke the law but you still hold some blame because you handed your wallet over after being warned not to.

No such thing as a chargeback.
Bitcoin allows direct payments without having to pay credit card or PayPal fees.
Bitcoin allows you to hold your money safely without needing to keep it in a bank. You can spend it easily without needing to have a debit card or pay ATM fees.
When you pay with your credit card you are handing over all the information needed to max your card out. Information is kept in plaintext on a mag strip. People have been able to steal people's information then make fake cards by reprogramming hotel keycards. With bitcoin you send the payment securely so they don't have access to the rest of your money.

You are starting from scratch. That's why it's so slow. You are downloading every bitcoin transaction ever. If you want to run a full node to help the network go ahead.

Last year we saw big investment in bitcoin companies and large companies started accepting it. Right after Microsoft announced they were accepting bitcoin and planning big things the amount of people talking shit went through the roof. Bitstamp just threw gasoline on the fire. I have yet to see where this bear market came from so suddenly. There's definitely a coordinated effort to bash bitcoin here and on twitter. I refuse to believe there are this many people that can dedicate their entire lives to just talking shit on here. Any reasonable person that doesn't like bitcoin just ignores it. They don't spend all their time posting beanz jokes and yelling ponzi in every thread. They don't spend time changing the argument to what the definition of trolling is when people call them out on it.

It's a forum to talk about bitcoin.
Can you say that there aren't troll accounts and a subreddit dedicated to fucking with this one? It's annoying when you're just trying to see what's new with bitcoin and half the stuff is just the same scam, ponzi, beanz, flooz, and bitcoin users are dumb posts and arguments about that over and over again. There are people bringing up good arguments against and suggestions for improving bitcoin but they are definitely outnumbered by people that dedicate themselves to shitting on bitcoin. It gets tiring and drives people off because they see threads like this that make the whole place look bad. Everyone is arguing with each other and accusing each other and the trolls are eating it up. Ever since Microsoft announced they were accepting bitcoin there has been a definite increase in the bullshit on here. It was already pretty high before.

RBF and SegWit will make it simpler. /s
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:46:41
Not a bad thing. RBF is unnecessary and dangerous. Lightning isn't bitcoin.

What's the point of crypto if you can only use it for large purchases? Offchain totally defeats the purpose...

All this hostility from changing a 1 to a 2. Me thinks you doth protest too much.

You sound like a banker.
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:44:44
Transaction fees that would go to miners will end up going to lightning.
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:50:46
Are they relaying transactions? Yes? They're nodes.
@_date: 2016-02-19 00:23:35
SegWit just moves things into another folder.
@_date: 2016-02-04 12:30:59
Just say 340 then.
@_date: 2016-02-04 05:50:15
Fuck em.
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:56:23
Putting transactions in another folder a la segwit is a cludge. Lightning is vaporware at this point. It will also take fees from miners.

I'm guessing it will take two weeks to find that info.

Leasing mining never makes money. If it did why aren't they just mining for themselves?
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:14:18
It's also not as effective as promised because in reality the size increase is less than they claim. It's kicking the can down the road. Not real capacity growth.
@_date: 2016-02-24 04:29:10
@_date: 2016-02-11 03:02:28
There's a simple fix. Change their 1 to a 2.

No escrow at the moment but I am working on it. I think a lot of it is the small market. I get pretty steady traffic and people signing up to bid and occasionally sell but no one ever actually bids.

Both sides do the same thing but in reverse. The prosecution tries to convince you that there is enough evidence that they are guilty. The defense tries to convince you that there isn't enough evidence or there is other evidence that indicates someone else and the jury decides the merits of each argument. Well, that's how it's supposed to work.

That's what they are doing with the fee. You can still send the transactions but you'll need a miner/pool that wants to process dust to find a block. It's still up to the miners, as it always has been, and the market will decide if there's enough demand for dust mining. If no miners want to deal with tiny fractions of pennies then the ridiculously small transaction club can move to Litecoin.

Last dividend payout was .011 per share. The .2 was just on the increase in share price. If you're patient I'd say buy a share and collect the dividends then flip them back into more shares. There's a lot of interest in it right now and asicminer should be bringing more hardware online soon so I'm guessing the shares/dividends will keep going up but who knows for sure. As with anything bitcoin right now the trend seems to be up long term with lots of bumps along the way. There was a big spike in share price a little while ago then it dropped and is now going back up. I am not a professional trader so take my advice with as much weight as you want. Hope that helps.

By Wall Street they are mostly just referring to the status quo investment community. Most fund managers have enough cash on their own to manipulate things without any direct help from the big boys. When Bitcoin finally takes hold the big companies with something to lose will get involved. Now they can simply rely on individuals that share their views that Bitcoin is bad news for the good old boys club and must be discredited and destroyed.

It's not real hacky. It's mostly just adjusting the fees to make sending ridiculously tiny amounts all the time not cost effective. The blockchain is filled with tiny transactions that aren't worth the time to mine them or the space it takes to store them in the chain. This should cut down on that.

The coins already exist in the code. I'm not creating money. It is given to me as a reward for securing the network.

They taught us bases for a month in fifth grade. It was the new math. They never mentioned what it was used for and we basically spent the entire time converting bases for whatever random number the teacher would ask for. Base 37. Base 19. Then it was never mentioned again. Only later when I started teaching myself computers and binary and hex did it suddenly make sense and I hated my teacher for being too dense to be able to explain it properly.

I'll fax over another copy.
No, I have the memo right here.
Mmmhmmm, great.

I had an old video with a copyrighted song and they just removed the audio.

I remember when it broke a million. It wasn't very long ago but it makes me feel old.

Bill Maher produces the HBO version and they all just laughed at bitcoin on Real Time. YouTube would be cool though.

Only miners. Nodes only relay transactions to other nodes.

Trying to earn back credibility among nerds after it came out they just hand things over to the NSA?

I sold a few bitcoin ornaments off zazzle last week.

It's unpossible to move coins without the password. Do you use a password vault? Is your password something non random? Do you use the same password multiple places? Have you scanned for keyloggers? You might have gotten phished also.

I guess it would depend who he writes for. If it's just some blag ignore him. If it's a major media outlet he needs to learn what objective journalism is or label it an opinion piece.

Everyone was already on that list before bitcoin was invented.

I didn't mean literally unlocked. The private keys are released.

You're right. Should have checked the URL.

I contacted them months ago about my 150 namecoins that failed to deposit even though the transaction confirmed and haven't heard anything.

Depends how small the deposits were that make up the .1. If it's a ton of .000001 deposits you'll have a problem where the fees take a big portion.

A few weeks ago people were saying it should be worth around 5-10btc.

Yeah I know but it's nice to dream. If only I was as lucky as I am unlucky. I'd get 4 in a row.

That's funny. I think Gizmodo is a huge pile of shit.

Thanks for the link. I missed that part of the story.

That was entrapment. They were told not to comply with DMCA takedowns because they would be destroying evidence. Then they raided them because they had copyrighted material. Also illegal wiretaps. This isn't like that at all.

Last price update on my phone was 2.69.

When I started they were $0.40. I've been through a ton of these dumps. No need to panic.

Hasn't really too much yet. Noobs still ask the same questions because they can't Google. Trolls still point out the same debunked claims because they can't come up with new ones. The media still posts articles rife with inaccuracies but now it seems they are doing it more intentionally to discredit Bitcoin. With all the info easily available it's either intellectual laziness or malice. Why is it so hard to describe mining? Also, now when I mention Bitcoin most people have at least heard the name somewhere before instead of having no clue.

Instead he had a hack saying you can only buy drugs with it. Although, with his fan base that might actually be a bump. :)

I wish they would stop using endangered animals to get boners.

Bought the last two. Great deals for a great cause. Plus Bitcoin. It's a prefect storm of awesome.
