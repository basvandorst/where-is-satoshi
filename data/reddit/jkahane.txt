Don't forget, you can use starbucks gift cards at Teavanna.  If that is your cup of tea.....

I'm not a fan of gaw or Paycoins, but you won't use them because they take Paycoins ? That's a bit much

1 Mh/s cost you 19.99 forever, with a fee of $0.08/day

Sounds like someone about to contact attorneys to me

Holy shit, you went through my post history.  Time to go outside.
I still think that gaw has tons of issues and red flags.
But, I don't think the company had anything to do with this hack.

As an escapie of gaw and hashtalk, which mods have left?

I've actually been supporting them (while being skeptical) until last night.  What a joke that was.  Well, in a ponzi, the people that jump out first are the only ones who profit.

I did the same today, I felt like I was ripping the people off. I did make a pretty significant profit, but one day you are going to go to check your btc and hashcoins and it's going to be a 404 error

Any word back?

He posted this hours ago, which is a well written and adult response and it's evident that a user did the hack and not gaw. But, let's just continue the anti gaw circle jerk

Came to reddit for a better explanation, only found people with the same questions
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:03:12
I don't understand it, so I hate it!

Man U look stupid now

So where did all the Maint fees go?? That's the real shame in this.  His customers paid this bill and he pissed it away
