Why would you pay for a savings account? My bank is free and I've used the same one for over 2 decades without a single problem

The same thing that has happened to the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, maybe? A gradual slide into worthlessness and then never talked about again

If the answer is yes (which is clearly is) then you buy.
I believe that 100%, it's just that there's a good chance it won't be bitcoin.

How's it illogical? look at the google trends data - people are googling "buy bitcoin" less and less. It's over

If I were to start my own service where people pay me in monopoly money, and then I personally go to Dell and pay for their orders in US dollars, would that mean that Dell accepts monopoly money? 
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:16:45


No, you're missing the point. Dell doesn't have to accept the monopoly money. My theoretical service accepts monopoly money, and then give US dollars to Dell. 
So the question again: does Dell accept monopoly money?

You're completely right. Why should anyone care if Bitcoin is actually being used? All that matters is that we can pump bitcoin by saying company x accepts it. The fact that they don't *actually* accept it is just semantic noise

Bitcoin as a currency has been stagnant for the past year. Bitcoin as a speculative bubble has been expanding rapidly

Nope, Australian living in Bayern/Austria :D
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:47:34


Haha, right...I live in Bayern and pretty much no one speaks/understands english here. Apart from kids doing the abitur and uni students, you'd be lucky to find someone who speaks hochdeutsch, let alone english...
I have talked to a *lot* of people around my age (mid 20's) since moving to germany, and I'd say maybe 5% of them can have a conversation in english

Would probably look something like the [google trends chart]( 5-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=bitcoin)

Considering adoption and interest has been decreasing over the last year, good luck with that
