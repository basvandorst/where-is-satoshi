What about a compromise of cold storage?
@_date: 2016-08-22 22:11:48
While an eventual ETF approval would be positive, being only for accredited investors would seem to me to severely restrict any resulting increase in demand. Any thoughts to the contrary?

Is cold storage (which probably accounts for ~98% of all the coins) insured?

If the binaries on the site can be replaced (or modified in flight), so can the published key and signature (to match the bogus binaries).  That's not uncommon in these types of attacks.

My complaint is that Coinbase seems to be sacrificing customer support for growth. They've expanded geographically a great deal at the same time they've cut customer support.
I could barely get a response from them for 17 days (and finally gave up). During that time period they announced further capabilities in Canada and Singapore, so clearly it's a matter of priorities. They are overwhelmed because they have chosen to invest in other areas and to subordinate the customer experience to these areas. 
I understand that once you accept VC money, you implicitly accept the growth mandate such that growth is all that matters (so the VCs can get 100x return in 10 years), but at some point this mono-focus becomes harmful without balance.
I'm rooting for Coinbase and hope that they re-balance priorities and turn things around.

My concern is that  would enable the BU crowd to generate a tremendous amount of FUD: "It's so slow, it's broken, they can't process transactions, fees are skyrocketing, compare it to BU, etc". 
Let's face it - the other side is much,much better at marketing than the dev side. To a large extent, that's why we're in this situation. Don't think for a second that BuVer won't leverage any problems resulting from  and do it very effectively. Logic and reason and explanations about why the sky is not falling won't matter any more then than they have with SegWit.
Therefore I believe that  is the best option.

How much of a security concern is the availability of cloud GPU clusters in the short term after a PoW change (in terms of a 51% attack)? AWS, Azure and Google all now offer GPU clusters and of course GPUs on instances. For example, Amazon EC2 P2 instances offer up to 16 NVIDIA K80 GPUs

Mind if I ask why is your confidence way up? I reluctantly divested for the first time. Just too much uncertainty for me. I've even considered loading up on BCC/USD pairs as I think core will ultimately prevail, but I just don't think the market is pricing in the risk yet (with either BCC or BTC). Would love have something change my mind and hodl again.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:37:01
Thank you for the response, and three cheers for you and other core contributors. I have 100% confidence in core to weather the storm. I should have said that none of my uncertainty lies there.  My uncertainty is market uncertainty. 
The tech battle will be won, but the other side is demonstrably more effective at marketing. I think there's substantial risk of excessive media FUD, a significant price decline, and an injurious hit on the Bitcoin 'brand' in the mainstream. None of it insurmountable, but slightly beyond my (fairly aggressive) risk profile for my personal financial situation at the moment.
Thank you for fighting the good fight!

Choice quote: "Complaining about a Bitcoin transaction backlog is like complaining that Ebay has a backlog because 90 people bid on a Honus Wagner baseball card and only one person got to win. I could bid a penny on Honus Wagner all day long, and still not get a card. That’s not a backlog; that’s just a crappy offer price."

For the record, here are the tweets:

"2/3 .. those responsible, we will spare no resources, get best lawyers and prosecutors to go after you wherever you will be in the world!"

I would hate to see the nuclear option of PoW change, and I realize that perhaps the statement is a tactic to broker a solution with Jihan, but regardless it seems like a reprehensible threat.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:32:31
Plus it seems a little odd to sue developers and maintainers of software for, um, developing and maintaining the software.
And does anyone really believe that developers on one of the leading cryptographic projects that exist are too dumb to do it securely and pseudonymously?
Again, I think a PoW change would be devastating for Bitcoin, but the courts are exactly part of the system that Bitcoin was designed to escape. Litigious behavior is not part of the Bitcoin balance of power.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:18:36
I don't think it's fair to dismiss concern about investments like that. To be fair, everyone in the space is concerned about their investment. He has to at least think about his nuclear option just like core has. And stating the option can sometimes be as effective as using it. Let's hope that with all of the nuclear options on the table that we can avoid mutually assured destruction. I hope that's what he's trying to achieve with his statement.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:34:40
I'll try to give him the benefit of the doubt for now and assume this is a tactic to help move Jihan to a solution. But it could of course be pure self-interest as a PoW change could an existential threat to his business.

Fixed costs. He's invested a ton of capital into non-liquid resources (miners, equipment, supply chains, knowledge) that can't just be moved into an altcoin. I'm not defending the statements - just answering your question why he can't just move his investment into an altcoin.

As mentioned, I continue to assume good faith on George's part. He's been a good member of the community, and I don't think that he just went nuts and decided to rant all of the sudden. I could be wrong. But I suspect there's a bigger, friendlier motive at work and that statement was a necessary move as part of that.  But any such statement is of course inherently worrisome (which is why it would make an effective statement in a larger move). I believe he is trying to drive a resolution as a peacemaker. Time will tell...
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:31:53
The costs are not yet sunk. Right now the costs are productive investments and could remain that way. The outcome of the Bitcoin Civil War will determine whether the costs sink or not.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:21:04
I'm not sure. There are some deep pockets who would probably be more than willing to fund a short-term attack to try to kill the core chain. They'd be protecting investments worth a lot more than that. I don't think they'd worried about the economics of cloud pricing for a few weeks. They'd have much bigger economics in mind.
The extra large P2 instance with 16 GPUs is $14.40/hour.  
16,000 GPUS (1000 instances) would be:
* $345,600 for one day
* $2,419,200 for one week
* $10,368,000 for 30 days
There's certainly plenty of money to fund that to try to kill in the anti-core-chain camp to fund that.
If there's PoW change, it will be a war of hash power, and I'm concerned about how the core chain supporters will compete. If we're not united and prepared against an united and well-funded opponent, I think we lose the war.

The scope of the decision is unclear to me. I believe that it is scoped to deciding whether or not the ETF application could be changed to the BATS exchange (rather than being a general decision on whether or not the ETF can launch). 
In other words, I believe that there might  be additional hurdles even if this change is granted.

This could be more headwinds for Jihan.  First, he's exposed as almost certainly screwing his customers. If this rumor is true, now his customers could be facing lower margin and increased regulation. 
I suspect that all of this (the covert AsicBoost exposé, the potential of UASF, potential lower margins and increased friction for customers) increases the likelihood of more drastic action more quickly. If all of it is true, he's in essentially an all-or-nothing situation to maintain his position. Thoughts?

That's a very gracious explanation. I could think of a number of other less charitable contributors to this behavior.
It's also hard for me to imagine many of the same individuals approaching and making demands of professionals in others areas of their lives (health, law, accounting, etc) in the same manner with a similar lack of visiblity. Which just goes to show the low status of software developers in the eyes of some non-technical individuals.

@_date: 2017-04-15 14:08:12
You nailed it.
I've often thought about about how software developers have ended up in the low status position that they occupy in most businesses and many businesspeople's minds.  I think that it largely comes down to two factors.
Occupations like medicine, law and accounting all have a long history prior to the modern corporation.  Software development on the other hand is of course very young and grew up in the Industrial Age inside corporations.
The hallmark of the Industrial Age is the separation of thinking and doing. Those further up in the hierarchy do the 'thinking', design standardized work, and then hire 'human resources' (less expensive than the 'thinkers') to do the work in the plans of the thinkers.  
Business education was developed to teach this system, and to this date business education prepares one to lead an industrial corporation (or to be an investment banker on Wall Street). So our universities churn out individuals who approach every business issue with a manufacturing mindset.  They are trained to operate in stable business cycles in an environment of predictability using long term plans and to use hierarchy and highly granular division of labor to achieve economies of scale.
Now along comes software development to their predictive plans - they just need some 'doers' to 'do' because they've already done the 'thinking'.  But software development is creative knowledge work that resists prediction and planning, which has diseconomies of scale, and which requires feedback loops. How does a typical businessperson react to that? By questioning their education or their experience in a hierarchical organization, realizing that the nature of the work is different, and adopting a new adaptive, collaborative, learning-based approach? Rarely. 
Typically it is the opposite. If the plan's not working out, the businesspeople feel it is clearly because they don't have enough control over the team or the team is undisciplined and not committed. So they try to establish control and predictability through micromanagement.  They feel it is especially important because developers  are expensive 'resources', so efficiency is even more important. They criticize developers as being difficult.  They blame the development team for ruining their predictive plans. They decide to never trust anything a developer says - after all, just look at how often their estimates are wrong. They decide that they need to second-guess everything that developers say. Treat developers with suspicion and a high level scrutiny. Guilty until proven innocent.
That's where things sit right now with many businesspeople now and in many (I would say most) businesses.  So development becomes a low status position subject to expectations and standards that would never be applied to other roles.
That's the best theory that I have at least - that the low status of developers is the product of:
* its birth and coming-of-age inside corporations during the Industrial Age
* business education and the Industrial Age thinking with which it continues to indoctrinate its students
Alternate theories welcome.
In the meantime, while some businesspeople struggle to find their footing and relevance in the 21st century, 'expensive typists' and 'mere technicians' like you will continue to change the world!
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:53:17
Let's see how Bitmain customers feel about this when word spreads...
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:21:26
Indeed. The inability to recognize less visible but clearly highly novel and complex efforts as being creative often seems almost... willful. Almost as if it would be threatening to those individuals to recognize their dependence on the efforts and those doing them.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:38:37
I believe that the low-status of engineers is due the overhang of industrial management mindset that has defined business education and therefore business for nearly a century. Industrial management is predicated on the separation of thinking (management) from doing (labor). The emphasis on economies of scale (to lower costs) results in thinking optimized to make labor fungible. This attitude has permeated business culture (and the larger culture) to such an extent that it usualy isn't even recognized as a mindset but is just seen as reality without an awareness that there are other ways.
Why are developers seen as fungible grunt labor when some other professions aren't? The legal profession is much older and thus pre-dates business education and thus has a different relationship. Time has also afforded lawyers the opportunity to form professional groups protecting their interests. Certain professions with highly explicit visible creative output (like visual designers) can also be exempted from low status.
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:44:52
Agreed. I was trying to supply a generous upper bound.
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:31:45
So let's see.. 
Requirements: polyglot, fullstack, development experience with multiple blockchains, development experience with both cryptocurrency and non-cryptocurrency 'verticals', mobile development, development experience with smart contracts, sidechain development experience, development lead across multiple orgs.
And the desired-but-not-required qualifications: penetration testing (not just any penetration testing but penetration testing involving game theory), real time OS development experience, and IoT integration experience.
I'm sure that all 27 such qualified individuals have no opportunity and will jump at the chance to be one of the 240,000 employees at the 23rd-largest company in the world.
