Man your not listening. Tethers not backed by anything but bitfinex’s cold wallet. Bitfinex borrowing from tether means it’s just borrowing from its own reserves

So the fact that now bitfinex is coming out publicly and stating repeatedly that they are the same company as tether makes me think that tethers backed reserves are just bitfinex’s cold wallets. The numbers add up more or less finex has about 1.2-1.5 billion in cold wallets and if you value btc at around 6k the numbers add up pretty clearly. Anyway if tethers are backed by bitfinex’s reserves and bitfinex lost all this money tethers aren’t backed by anything but themselves. Kinda sly though I guess it would work like this, print a billion tethers from nothing, buy a billion dollars worth of btc , load your affiliate exchange and now you are technically backed 1:1 with usd equivalent. Enough to perpetually fix the market, and if you are lucky and your operation never hits a deficit you will technically not be lying about being backed 1:1 with usd or equivalent. Except for a second at the beginning but who cares about that

Because if they called them bitfinexbucks and told everyone bitfinexbucks are backed with bitfinex cold wallet reserves the crypto world would be like WTF that’s not even your money backing that bullshit. But if you rename your pretend money and pretend like it has its own reserves then people will actually believe it’s 1:1
