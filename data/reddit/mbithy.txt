Not coincidence, writing as third party is just a habit. Also you don't mention those other established brokers, instead of bashing us perhaps you should promote what you love?

Thank you for your insight, solid points. I do have experience trading binary options. I did not just wake up one day and out of the blue get an idea build a platform that supports bitcoin. I can tell you from my experience even when a brokers website says they are regulated by fcc, cyprus or F******  GOD, as an investor who would really like and knows how to trade understands that for every new broker you want to trade with you always start small and see if the broker checks out for yourself, Not because their website says so but I hear you. Just to mention a few I have traded with IQ Options, Alpari, StockPair, expertoptions(these checked out-always pay) and I have also been scammed. So I know where you are coming from, I did not build this platform to solicit something from anyone unfairly just to be clear, my intentions are pretty clear on the website. 
On your point though, bitcoin is hardly recognized as a currency by many controlling institutions in many countries including ours which makes regulating it a shit storm. And Until it becomes something that can't be tossed to the side by those institutions you are going to have to trust your gut with cryptocurrency dealings. But if we keep shooting down every idea that supports bitcoin(or any other crypto) it may never get there.
