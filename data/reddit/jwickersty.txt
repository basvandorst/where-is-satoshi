But kraken has high fiat deposit fees no ?

Bottom of the barrel internet hee-haw. I love it, I’m stealing it.

Thanks for the replies so far but I’m still confused about what they actually ARE. I can give you 1 Satoshi right? Is that just a term to mean .00001 BTC? Or are there actually Satoshis floating around out there? Do people have wallets with Satoshi in them, and pass them around like BTC?

Yeah the lightning network is my next thing to understand. I’ve been paying just little enough attention for the last few years that sats and the LN snuck up on me. No clue why the LN is different, has diff fees, and is able to transaction Sats when regular brokerages can’t.

This is the best use of this bot I’ve seen yet :)

It’s a 4B

You’re talking about Shenanigans, right??!

Thanks for all the additional replies. Totally clears it up. Appreciate it pals!

Hey Farva... what’s the name of that restaurant with all the goofy shit on the wall...
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:39:44
Oh that’s interesting. I’ll try that

PMing you

Awful rates tho. BTC is around $8170 today but this machine sells for $10200+. That’s the part I don’t get about ATMs. The rates seem so horrendous, why bother?

Well, I followed your idea and mounted the MicroSD card on my linux server. Would you believe that the RaspiBlitz turns /etc/ssh into a symbolic link to the external USB hard drive that the RaspiBlitz stores the Bitcoin blockchain on. How bizarre! So there was no file there to modify. But I pulled the external drive out of the RaspiBlitz case and mounted that one, and low and behold there was the /etc/ssh folder. I restored the config back to the standard SSH port, and then put everything back together in the RaspiBlitz case. One boot up later, and everything is restored and I can SSH in.
I really appreciate your ideas and our conversation. You really helped me restore the RaspiBlitz so I can get to learning more about the Lightning Network and add my Bitcoin and Lightning nodes into the ecosystem.
Please accept this bizarre Reddit Gold thing as a token of my appreciation. I don't really know if people care about this gold thing, or if it's all just dumb, but if it makes your reddit experience better for a week and shows my thanks, I'm happy to do it.

What’s a ZJ?

So it seems like this chart isn’t all that amazing? I mean, it tells you *something* but it’s not a primary type way to read things...?
@_date: 2019-10-21 22:41:34
Have PMd all those interested in where this is.
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:28:42
Happy cake day. I can’t get in to be able to run any commands on command line. That’s the problem. If I could, I would just change the port back to 22 and restart. 
At this point, I imagine my only hope is to attach the keyboard to the pi and somehow figure out how to break out of the raspiblitz display, but it doesn’t seem to respond to ctrlc or ctrlz so I can’t drop to command line.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:58:25
Love this.

It’s a nice idea, like Acorns. But I’m wary of every new thing related to bitcoin. Way too much bullshit, scams, and insecure fly by night apps out there to mess around with no clue. Shame.
@_date: 2019-10-21 20:32:39
Not to my knowledge. They just had the ATM in there.

Yes I have it connected to a screen and keyboard but when a raspiblitz boots it goes right to a simple status screen that just gives you raspiblitz status. I can’t figure a way to break out of that screen and get to command line. Ctrlc and ctrlz don’t seem to do anything.

This was a very nice back and forth. I just wanted to say it’s really great when reddit community is actually kind and helpful and friendly, and not just memes and circlejerk puns and putting down people who want to have a conversation and ask questions. Cheers all!

For those of us that don’t get it, what’s the point of all that?
