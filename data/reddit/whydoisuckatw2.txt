The reddit cryptocurrency needed to be done like this:
The author of a paper (research .pdf from the university/professor/charity/think tank/etc), article from a news organization, creator of something makes a reddit post.
If someone donates cryptocurrency to it (the post + reddit account (could even be separate wallets based on Subreddit's Option)), then wallet(s) are created, address visible to the public (or private, this is a Subs Option).
Comments on the submission can also be open wallets. This means a commenter who takes the time to make a correction can now be the focus of people who want a comment to be seen. Did someone post something bullshit? Call them out and you will be rewarded.
What happens then? The author is now on a clock (Sub Option) to **update their submission and fix their bullshit** (the cost of which is a SO, if any) or their wallet is then split (or given, or nulled) to the commenter(s).
Depending on what kind of subreddit you want, you can negate most spam/corporate shills/comments of no substance/offtopic discussions quite easily (just with these options.
It starts as its own cryptocurrency, and if it is healthy and if it is what people desire in a cryptocurrency, its public record can be distributed quite easily (you could even piggy back it off existing currencies with cryptograffiti to encode messages (and these messages can themselves be encrypted!)).
If the community decides that changes need to be made, they can contribute their currency (or another currency (subreddit option!1!1)) to people who know how to make those changes (or people who know how to correct others!).
