Do you think an old lady selling vegetables on the side of the road is going to put her savings into an offline Bitcoin wallet?
No, she'll just try to find USD cash and put that in a box under her bed.
There is a reason why all those people in Russia, Venezuela, Cyprus or wherever else currencies are crashing, prefer US dollars to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not practical, and it's more volatile than their crashing currencies in the first place, so why would they even bother?

I can indeed "math" that with 2.1 quadrillion satoshis outstanding, a $0.1 per Bitcoin valuation would allow the Bitcoin cash system to process 2.1 USD billion of transactions per day, assuming 0.1% daily turnover.
That's assuming the current version of the protocol can actually scale to do that.

First, Wall Street is mostly about firms: mergers and acquisitions (and corporate strategy), bringing investors and firms together, and then trading and selling the securities issued by those corporations (debt, equities) or by similar entities (governments, etc.)
Why should they care about a payment system? VISA and Western Union might be interested.

There has to be a better way, but acting like Diogenes is not going to convince people.
Life is complex. Society is complex. Our institutions are complex. Life is imperfect, and so are our societies and institutions. Some of those institutions do suck and need to be improved or changed.
The libertarian argument is precisely that things are complex, we don't know as much as we think we know, we should take time and experiment and let competitive solutions emerge. This is a very humble proposition.
If you act like you know what's right and want to brutally change fundamental institutions, you act more like a revolutionary or a Marxist than someone who understood libertarian ideology.

If they're genuine wealth managers, they should have some proper asset management training and they should certainly know better than to expect an investment with a 12-month ROI of 1,000% to be a sensible investment (reminder: the long-run equity risk premium is about 7% p.a., and that's the benchmark for risky investments).

What? No. Certainly not.
In the long run, the price of 1 Bitcoin is cointegrated (~ equivalent) with the price of what 1 Bitcoin replaces.
Once you figure out what 1 Bitcoin replaces you should have an idea of the fair value of 1 Bitcoin.

It does not have to become a reserve currency.
But you would need to have an actual economy, i.e. people selling stuff for bitcoins, which is currently not the case (all the stuff "priced" in bitcoins is actually priced in some real currency and converted on the fly, in real time, i.e. not really priced in bitcoins).
So if I could buy three kilos of bananas for 1 bitcoin, I could figure out what's 1 bitcoin worth in other currencies (= 3 kilos of bananas in that currency).
Right now there is obviously no Bitcoin economy. So the price is worth 0, plus or minus speculation (noise). In other words, the price follows a random walk with negative drift. Which perfectly explains the observed pricing pattern.

It was transacted in Bitcoin, but the actual pricing was done in USD (i.e. the "enterprising young merchants" would regularly update their price to follow the exchange rate). In other words, it was actually priced in USD.
An underground drug supermarket does not make an economy, anyway.
Same thing for the Overstock claim. A few might keep some bitcoins, but they don't price in bitcoins.
Regarding the value for transactions, you are right. See this post of [post of mine](

You'd need to have products or services (and wages) *actually priced* in bitcoins.
This is the only way to have a meaningful exchange rate.

Back in 1996, were you hoarding IPv4 addresses?

I won't take that bet for a few reasons:
1) That's a biased bet :)  
2) I'm not a gambler  
3) I'm confident that in the long run Bitcoin price will converge to 0 (but might float at some arbitrary, small value above zero due to option value, residual noise and stuff like that), but I'm not making any forecast; for all I know it might actually go to $450 at some point; as I said it's a random walk with negative drift  
4) This account is not my main reddit account, it's a throw-away, so I'm not putting any reputation in the balance  
5) I'd rather invest that money in the equities market  
But we don't really need to make that bet. You're long Bitcoin, I'm out of that market. The outcome will be the same.

You can only value a currency in terms of other currencies (i.e you can only determine exchange rates).
Most exchange rate models are variations around the same variables: money supply, interest rates, output (i.e. GDP), and some less important variables (e.g. in some economies you would include commodity prices).
That's obviously completely useless in the case of Bitcoin, since it's not associated with a particular economy, and since it's not really a currency in the first place (it's a payment system with a fixed number of tokens).
So bitcoins are more like a commodity. Not unlike currencies, you can value commodities in terms of other commodities (since you can substitute one for another: you can produce energy using oil, gas, coal, peat, wood and so on).
So you can value 1 Bitcoin in the same way. What does 1 Bitcoin allow you to do better than something else? What's the value (or price) of that "something else"?

Everyone was part of those compromised bitcoins. This just means that now they owe X coins to their customers, but have X-18k in reserve.
If everyone was cashing out today they would be insolvent. Thus they are technically insolvent
 Thus everyone should be cashing out ASAP. Thus they are insolvent. This is called a bank run and that's the only stable equilibrium from a game theory point of view.
You'd have to be stupid to be one of the last users to keep money in that exchange, because you would be the users owed the missing 18k.

I'm an actual libertarian (as in, not an "Internet libertarian", as in, I've actually read Bastiat, Hayek, Friedman, Salin and many more you've never heard about).
I do agree that excessive government is a bad idea. The only way to fight that bad idea is to convince other people that 1) it's a bad idea and 2) your ideas are better. That's it. That's very difficult and can take decades. But it's the only way. This is actually the central tenet of a liberal democracy: allowing debate with people you don't agree with. Another tenet is the rule of law.
So if you want to subvert society, through violence or tax evasion using Bitcoin or whatever, you're not even playing by your own rulebook.
