Based on what I see, volatility is easing.  Those dips and sags, hopefully, should make me feel less crappy when they do happen...

There might be a dip at 8888 Yen, but I don't think it will be as big as the previous one (PBoC interference).  Might be a lower risk to sell some BTC for a small gain.  Either way, best to HODL.  Segwit and Lightning will move this mother of all currency to the MOON!

They keep telling the drugs and weapons story.
Although they finally admit that adoption has increased...

The r/bitcoin rule is BUY THE DIP and HODL! It's never failed...the more we hold, the more the day traders minimize price fluctuations and volatility :).

I think the only restriction in Chinese exchanges is bitcoin withdrawals. They can't take the bitcoins off the exchange, but they can do everything else.
But yes, I do think that we could see a price bump in about a month's time.

I only care about growth, and we all know that's where bitcoin is going.  How fast it grows, we will never know.
As long as you diversify your investments you will definitely feel more comfortable.  Bitcoin is just one of a billion ways you can.

Doubt it.  To go from Fiat -&gt; BTC -&gt; Fiat required two transactions on the chain.  It would take way too long for that.  I see what you're getting at, but essentially it's pointless to do that.
The whole point of BTC is to transact in BTC.

I use Quadriga. Very simple and I like the Interac payment methods.
@_date: 2017-02-16 23:43:50
I don't think so. QuadrigaCX is the only one I use

I use Copay as an online wallet.  Works great.  Highly recommended that you store large amounts of BTC in cold storage like a Trezor though.

I'm no trader expert, but I think it would depend on what the country classifies BTC as.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:52:16
I took your survey.  My only issue is the lack of companies that accept BTC.

HOLY! Where is MoonGuy?

Here's a photo of the ad.  They're talking about the possible rise and fall of BTC based on SEC decision.

I won't record, but the ad was from Etoro.

But even if they short the ETF, it won't have as large an effect on the entire BTC market because they are limited to the ETF.
Correct me if I'm wrong...
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:32:52
They could always sell the dip. They just couldn't withdraw BTC from the exchange.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:50:02
Sounds like all the more reason to keep BTC off your smartphones and on a paper wallet or Trezor...
I'm debating if I should even have a smartphone anymore...  This is nuts.

My comment is, why don't they just get along and do both at the same time. One upgrade, one hard fork, done.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:12:40
No. I like eth for its smart contracts idea. I could care less what option gets approved for BTC. It just needs to be fixed. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:51:50
Oh don't worry I'm diversified :)
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:35:51
Perfect sign that we need a huge fix to improve transaction time and fees.  It's getting way too expensive and users of BTC are losing to miners.

Welcome to the most "diverse" country in the world: CANADA.

Americans appear to be hodling, but there's still large transactions of buy/sell on Huobi and BTCC.  I think the profiteers have mostly finished, but there could still be a slow trend downwards over the next month.
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:11:04
Just hodl. I Bought around $1400 CDN for my first time. The more people that hodl will mean that the value will continue to rise to that level as a normal. This drop will weed out the chickens. Adoption of BTC is only going up. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:59:45
I agree with his, I've only bought BTC through QCX, but have never withdrew CDN yet. I'm a first time BTC buyer and am hodling. What a way to buy right when the roller coaster starts taking on gravity haha.

You pay a tx fee each time you send from wallet to wallet. Fee is required to be entered into the next block to reward the miners. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:02:34
Transaction fees.
