If I send bitcoins to this site then back to my wallet will I get more coin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:28:15
I agree completely, kind of nervous as most of my portfolio is in Litecoin right now. I want to put it back into bitcoin but feel more confident regarding LTC in the short term. Long term I think bitcoin will rise though

why are you shilling for coinbase and BCCASH? Do you think this was clean and there was no insider trading?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:42:25
thank you prosecutors for legitimizing bitcoin as something with endorsed value

I guess we have different opinions of Tucker, from what I've seen he usually articulates himself quite well, his guests...not so much. 
If anything the problem of his show is that he often gets the most sensational left wingers on as guests (lots of college students and heads of nonprofits) and then extrapolates their folly to that whole side of the political spectrum.

Took over 5 hours to transfer my btc to bittrex today. Missed out on a huge spike on the alt I was investing in. Luckily I already had some of it, but I would've made 3 times as much had the transaction cleared sooner.

well played friendo

Yeah I just don't get it. I research various coins and look into them and don't see the point of BCCash. I understand why Litecoin might exist as a faster way to send amounts than bitcoin and why they can coexist together. But I don't for one second understand how BCCASH is any better than Litecoin? My understanding is that it has larger block sizes and takes more time and energy than litecoin.
It just seems to go against what the crypto community stands for

Were the people not able to upload documents for KYC after the fact and thus become verified?

I hope you're right. This whole thing fucking stinks to high heavens

The other day it took me 5 hours to send from coimbase to bittrex. Wouldn't be surprised if it takes even longer today due to the traffic

Posting, I'd love to participate!
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:44:22
should I do this? I don't have much and lost satoshis on this. I still don't understand why, but a coin that I predicted would have big gains today was very screwed by the bitcoin dip. Now my overall satoshi level is smaller than it would've been if I just left it in bitcoin. Should I still move it over? too late?

perhaps but if Trump tweeted something positive about bitcoin that would only send the value higher. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of politcal americans, his base, who might not otherwise be into bitcoin, would immediately jump in and buy because they trust Trump, thus sending the value higher

I've got to wonder how many people are both buyer and seller. Like what's to prevent someone from placing an ask order of 140 BTC at $14,000, and then set themselves up on another account on another computer and buy that 140 with their own USD in order to drive down the price? I know that sounds dumb the way that I said it...why would you pay for something you already have...but if it allows all prices to drop, or go even lower, you might be able to scoop enough coin that it would be worth it. Just a thought, not sure if that's how it works
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:00:49
Guessing that the market wasn't destabilized when they did that. I don't get it, the idea of adding a coin with such a high price makes no logical sense to me (unless it's all just an insider trading pump n dump to end all pump n dump schemes). At the same time, I've been wanting to see BTC dethroned for a while (ideally having Litecoin or another big coin take it's place). I don't like the idea of BCCASH doing it, but if that's what it takes then it's what it takes
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:28:05
Glad to have another believer here! I'm literally all in with Litecoin, I have no other cryptos right now. Still, I think bitcoin will continue to dominate for a while in terms of value. In truth, it would be great if bitcoin could become stable with very slow but steady gains, so that it could be used as a cushion for more volatile alt-coin trading. Altcoin goes up, sell into BTC, altcoin goes down, use the BTC to buy it. Currently it can be difficult to do this when BTC itself is going way up and way down each day.

This is what I noticed a few days ago. Many coordinated attacks to drive down price at certain time intervals. It's kind of scary, because even if you think that doesn't matter or shouldn't matter...many traders will not see it that way and will panic, which is the intended goal of the price fudging.

I mean his schtick now is making perplexed faces when his guests say seemingly absurd things, or things that he disagrees with strongly. I find most of Tucker's arguments compelling although sometimes he does falter a bit. Still, I think he is miles better than someone like O'Reilly or Sean Hannity, he's able to disagree with people and not be an asshole about it. I always do my research on the issues. Anyways great talk but back to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:22
I just think it would have been better and a more stable transition if Coinbase announced ahead of time when BitcoinCash would be added. 
The extreme dips in Bitcoin earlier today, combined with the rolling out of BCCASH on Coinbase is very damaging for the market

If it's on Fox and Friends, that means Trump is watching it. All that has to happen is for Trump to tweet about bitcoin. He does that, and it shoots to $100k per coin overnight
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:28:40
thanks for not shitting on me lol, I'd love to hear Tucker's thoughts re: bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:30:52
Very good point, my comment was mostly in jest for what it's worth. I think you're absolutely correct though. 
Last week I watched the white house press conference one day, and one of the reporters asked about bitcoin. Probably the only non-politically inflammatory question asked. He queried whether Trump was aware of Bitcoin and what the administration was thinking about. 
Sanders basically said that yes Trump is aware of bitcoin but otherwise the administration has no official policy towards it. Kind of a non answer, but it is def on their radar.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:42:07
in terms of people on major cable news, Tucker is the only person that actually seems rational and not full of himself, he'll joke around with guests even if they disagree with him strongly
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:33
Yeah, as soon as things cool down I'm transferring everything off coinbase and either into bittrex or my personal wallet. Will never use fiat to buy crypto on coinbase again. This is fucking disgusting. 
Is this what they did when Litecoin and Ethereum got put on coinbase? Relatively new to all this, but did they just throw those coins up there or did they announce it first.
