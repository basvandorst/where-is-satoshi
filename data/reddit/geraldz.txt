The new USDC stablecoin has eliminated the volatility issue and there are zero fees to convert to or from USD.  The first point of sale app to work with USDC is now available on the CryptoForMerchants website.

He's the one trying to save $1,000 per month on credit card fees.  Why would I want to take on the risk of fluctuating BTC?  If he wants to proceed he will have to understand the risks vs. rewards.  As cryptocurrency adoption grows I think the value will go up.  But I'm not going to guarantee that.

No, I still have a lot to learn and much testing to do.  Coinbase offers a $10 referral fee for new users who spend $100 and to the person who referred them.  So he can encourage folks to sign up - they get $10 and at the same time he can offer $10 off of a haircut from his cut  - so basically a free haircut for customers who get set up to pay with crypto.

A reviewer   says there is a 1% fee?
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:07:27
I'd like to look at it.  What is the catch?  How do you make money?  I wouldn't care for anything that skims a percentage off each transaction; but I think it's reasonable to make a one-time investment in an app that works well.
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:35:52
Don't Bitpay and others charge a 1% fee for that?  It's cheaper to transfer your crypto to an exchange and sell it yourself. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:10:43
Thanks for your opinion.  I can see that you still pay $30 for a taxi ride while everyone else is paying $5-$10 on Uber and Lift.  Let's try to image the future where disruptive technology puts an end to banks making a profit off of your purchase of toilet paper.

The problem is that a lot of his customers pay with their credit card.  They don't carry cash anymore.  He is going to have an ATM installed in his shop but customer will have to pay a $2 withdrawal fee and then their own bank may charge an additional "out of network" fee.  I don't think they will be happy about paying $2-$5 to get their own money.
@_date: 2018-10-19 13:16:04
Yes, that's pretty much what I have in mind at this point.  But a point-of-sale system would be nice where he can touch a screen and select the service provided (mens haircut $15, childs haircut $12, etc) and then the customer can select a tip ($5, $3, $2, etc).  Then click on the pay button and a QR code pops up for the total amount to be transferred to his wallet.
Gemini's trading fee schedule appears to be much higher that GDAX or Kraken (1% if less than $25k)

Promoting the adoption of disruptive technology is supporting the community. It reduces costs and improves standards of living.  FYI I operate a successful business and understand small business finance and taxation quite well. It doesn't matter what currency you accept, your tax liability is the same. I've been watching BTC for quite a while and it appears to have stabilized. Although it could drop 20% I don't think that is likely. It could also go up 20%.  I will explain the risks and let him make his own decision.  Something tells me you must be in the banking business and are scared shitless. You should be. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 13:02:44
I figure he's doing a little over $30k per month.  Square Pay is no different than PayPal or other credit card processors.  Their fee is 2.75% - highway robbery!  No, he does not have a website.
@_date: 2018-10-19 13:15:39
1% transaction fee?  That's what we're trying to get away from.  Accepting and transferring bitcoin to and from a wallet should be free.  Exchanging bitcoin for USD should be per the maker/taker fee schedule of 0.1 - 0.3%.  And transferring USD to or from a bank account should be $5-$10 per transaction.  That is what I am looking for.
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:51:55
That looks interesting but I'm not sure a proprietary device is needed.  I'd much rather have an app running on a tablet which eliminates any 3rd party intermediary and associated fees.
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:37:32
And then there are folks like me who are sick and tired of megabanks skimming 3.5% off of every damn penny I spend including for toilet paper!  What Uber did to taxi drivers crypocurrency will do to these thieves!
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:33:45
There are about 6 barbers and usually customers waiting.  So I think it would be easy for a barber to walk up to a tablet, press the appropriate payment button and display the QR code for the customer to scan.  No need to input anything else.
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:39:37
This is a very popular barber shop and if folks want to get their haircut here they will have no choice but to bring cash or set up a wallet and pay with crypto.  So it's something folks are eventually going to have to adopt, otherwise they can get a crappy haircut somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:53:20
I looked at Square Cash, they charge the same fees.  I think anyone that is in the credit card business is not going to cut their own throat by offering a product with no or lower fees. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:02:47
That is his revenue, not what he is making.  There are 6-8 barbers in a very busy town.  We actually have 2 Lowes stores right down the street from each other.  The word is that the first store was  in the country in sales and they wanted to protect their turf from Home Depot.
Here's my guess:  $1000 per month in fees, probably 3% average.  That equals $33,333 is monthly sales.  At $15 per cut, that's 2222 haircuts.  He's open 6 days per week, say 25 days per month.  That's 89 haircuts per day.  Let's assume 6 barbers per day = 15 cuts per barber per day.  My haircut takes about 30 minutes, so thats 7-1/2 hours per day.  Not unreasonable.
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:33:38
3% buyer fee?  OpenBazaar is true peer-to-peer  with no middlemen.  Period.
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:32:20
Retards.  Any coin or token that is not stable has no value in commerce.
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:38:04
I don't understand why anyone would "invest" in Bitcoin.  The network is awfully slow and can probably never handle mass adoption.  The network fees are much higher than others.  And the price is volatile so you can't really use it for everyday currency to buy things.  Now that USDC is available, you can purchase it, buy and sell things without the risk of price fluctuations, and then convert it back to fiat for very little cost.  Who on earth would accept Bitcoin when you can accept USDC without the high cost, 10-90 minute verification window and the risk of it's value going down?  I don't mean to rain on your parade, but please help me to understand why anyone thinks Bitcoin has a future?
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:50:21
I love the idea but Bitcoin is the wrong blockchain.  They should focus all of their energy on Ethereum compatibility so folks can use ERC-20 tokens for payment.
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:07:39
They work just like slot machines. You put your money in and probably won't see it again. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:07:54
Sounds like a chicken or egg problem
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:25:56
Carrying a wad of cash around in your pocket is more secure that a wallet on your phone?  To answer your question - so that merchants can say "no" to credit cards, like my barber has, and save the freaking $1000 per month in fees.  This will ultimately result in lower prices for consumers.  That's what makes blockchain disruptive.  It is going to disrupt VISA, Mastercard et al's scheme to extract fees on everything you buy including toilet paper.  Think about it - every time you wipe your ass VISA or Mastercard has profited.  
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:35:36
With Bitcoin's volatility it has little utility in commerce.  There are several stablecoins on the Ethereum network including the USDC coin which is always worth one USD.
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:17:50
He bought a lottery ticket and lost. But I think he learned that money is not happiness. 
@_date: 2019-09-21 01:45:01
Yes, but how much did you pay in fees?  Bitcoin isn't useful in commerce.  It will take a stablecoin to do that.
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:16:55
If you're in the business of drug dealing or human trafficking you are correct.  Otherwise I trust it.  Another difference is they don't rape you with transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:50:22
Do you trust the US dollar?  What do you use to buy groceries?  If you're not in the business of providing a platform for hate groups, thiefs, etc. - there should be no need for concern.  The USDC is an ERC-20 token, so should the CENTER Consortium do anything questionable it would be easy to transition to another stablecoin such as DAI.  But for now I think a dollar-backed crypto is the right answer for today.
@_date: 2018-12-02 01:57:22
The floodgates will open when BTCPayServer works with ERC20 stablecoins such as USDC.  Until then I don't think many merchants want to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-30 02:16:41
Another fee service.  The nice thing about crypto is that you don't need a middleman.  BTCPayServer is just one.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:28:24
It's a great idea but it's built on the wrong network.  Bitcoin et al isn't really useful in commerce.  Waiting for Ethereum/ERC20 token support.
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:47:13
Only a fool would use Bitcoin in commerce now that USDC is available
@_date: 2018-12-17 10:32:24
There are hundreds if not thousands of tokens on the Ethereum network most of which will fail.  However I think we will see mass adoption and growth of the more useful ones such as the stable USDC which actually holds it's value and can be used in commerce.   So the opportunity may be in the growing mining requirement, not in speculation of becoming another prized hot potato.  That said, as Ethereum transitions from POW to POS I'm not sure what that means for mining?
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:54:54
I don't trust any financial services firm that profits from the credit card business.  Crypto should be free with no middleman except for very small miners fees.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:18:17
USDC is not a shitcoin.  It's a digital coin that you can actually use in commerce because it's value is fixed.  And it doesn't lose value because a real $1 bill is set aside as collateral.  Just a matter of time before merchants start adopting it to get away from those crazy credit card fees.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:08:14
What all would be involved to changing over to mining ETH?  That's where the growth is going to be.
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:57:17
What's the predominant cryptocurrency being adopted down there - Dash?
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:33:03
That's nice but unfortunately the future is on the Ethereum blockchain.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:11:47
Blockchain will cut out the middleman.  Millions of merchants will be able to accept USDC for payment and avoid billions of dollars in credit card fees once we reach widespread adoption.  That's what makes it disruptive.
