It's difficult if not impossible to pin down price fluctuations to a single cause. It's difficult if not impossible to know what factor(s) are the "reason" why the price is what it is at this moment. There isn't always a single or simple explanation. 
The unpredictability of individuals' reactions and decisions play a role. I try not to reason away every price fluctuation.

"Crashing." A bit over dramatic, wouldn't you say? 
Let's take a step back. 11 days ago the price was $579. Now it's "crashed" down to $648 a couple hours ago, and it's since largely rebounded.

Or like asking an Uber driver about self driving cars

Yes. 
So you're saying if electrum accepted the seed, it's definitely an electrum seed? Electrum wouldn't accept a seed created by a different wallet?
If that's the case and the balance is truly 0, why does the electrum history show nothing?

Yep, they are on this list.

Ok I understand but at what point do I enter my old password? Like I said above, when I try to recreate/restore the wallet through electrum, it does ask for the seed but never asks what my old password was.

Oh yeah. I know that nowadays. Back then when BTC was worth like $10, I wasn't concerned about it. :)

OK I figured out I think this was a blockchain wallet because I found an old email with my wallet identifier. When I tried to login to it through the website, it says my password is wrong. When trying to recover password, it asks for the seed, but then won't let me hit continue. Maybe it thinks the seed is invalid?
*Edit - Nevermind, I realized the blockchain wallet email is from a few months after the email I sent to myself with the seed, so that must not be what the seed was for.

Nope, they do not all show up on that list.

Just tried this. No go. Zero balance and no transaction history. 
Zero balance I would somewhat expect but no transaction history? Hmm. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:17:10
Hm, well if I simply put the password at the end of the seed as a 13th word, Electrum doesn't recognize it and grey's out the 'next' button. And again, when I go to the screen, it only asks for a new password so I don't think it ever asks for the old one. Unless I'm missing something?
And to clarify, not only does electrum say 0 balance, it also shows no transaction history.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:25:43
Yeah I tried that (entering my old password when it prompts me to enter a new password for this wallet) and it shows 0 balance and no tx's.

Well when I generate a new wallet with Electrum, is asks for the old seed but then prompts me to enter a new password. Never asks for the old one. So I don't think the password matters once you're regenerating a wallet from seed, since it's associated with an old wallet that no longer exists, right? 
Anyway, if what you say is true then it must mean the balance truly is zero :-/
