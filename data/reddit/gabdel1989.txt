This is especially handy when BTC is trading within a range, and we might actually stay between 3 and 5k for a good while.

It is not fool proof, but Its just better than going in with no plan at all.
Feel free to share better strategies though to help a fellow HODLer who does not know better.

The little old lady trick is pretty handy if you want to increase your BTC stack.  
Basically you keep your main stack, and keep some fiat aside.  
On every big drop you buy some, so BTC goes from 3.8k to 3.5k buy 20%, if it drops again to 3.2k buy another 20%, if it goes back to 3.5k you sell your first 20% and keep only the 3.2k BTC. If it drops again you buy another 20%, and if it moons you got your main stack so you don't miss out. If it keeps dumping and you are out of fiat, then at least you have at least Dollar cost averaged in reasonably.

Just let bitcoin do its thing. Mentioning it once is enough in my experience.
If anyone is interested they will do their own research.
I brought this up to my brother early 2018, he's a seasoned trader, used to trade egold back in the day, so the moment he heard of bitcoin he got into it, and made a killing trading BNB in this bear market.
On the other hand, I have been trying to explain to my friends that this might be a good investment opportunity and just put a few bucks in BTC and let it sit, but they think it is going to 0, so I do not bother with them.
Funny thing is when it was above 10k they were upset they didnt learn about it earlier.

I would love to believe that, but honestly seeing how many people are still willing to throw money at utter shiitcoins, I kind of lean to side with Tone Vays view that we need a lot of shiitcoins to perish before we can start a new healthy bullrun.
I hope Constantinople turns out to be a real game changer for Ethereum, and we get some real usecases out of Ethereum 2.0 and Lightning Network (LApps) for bitcoin. That would make a lot of the so called altcoins (who do nothing but rehash old ides or fork existing projects and stick their brand on them) to go under, and we can probably rally from there.
Other than that, I dont see many scenarios where the market can go back to 2017's ATH.
I hope I am wrong though.  
Edit: Clarifying some points

Get into Crypto Twitter and follow some quality influencers instead. This is the wrong place to get acquianted with Crypto.
If you are looking for a circle-jerk to reassure yourself that you will become a millionaire from putting a few bucks into Bitcoin, then you are in the right place.

lol, Sorry, I did not actually see the edit. Thank god you were actually joking.
Honestly, it is hard to tell who's serious and who's joking nowadays, because some comments are just that ridiculous.

Uhh, you think hyperinflation of the USD is good for bitcoin?
First of all if it happens, $BTC dollar value won't mean squat. Second. given the technology is still early and price is based mostly on speculation, most investors will jump ship in favor of store of values that were historically proven to be reliable, like real estate, gold, or just spend it on consumable goods that will see their prices skyrocket rather than HODLing bitcoin.
Word of advice, if you are investing in Bitcoin expecting to get back 694x return on investment on an asset (that is at 121B marketcap) by the end of 2020, then for the love of god, do some research to understand the technology more, or get your money back before you get burned. This is financial advice!
I know this is gonna get downvoted to hell, but if it means it could save one guy who reads it from losing their money, it is definitely worth it.

Lol, You have such a delicate way of debating. Ok let's break it down?
Assuming there is a financial crisis, why would I buy Bitcoin? 
* We cannot transact with it on a global scale since its limited to 7 transactions per second and when we hit that ceiling, the network gets so slow, it takes hours for a transaction to confirm, and transaction fees go through the roof.
* Technological Barrier to entry is very high,to get bitcoin, I have to sign up to an exchange, KYC, buy the coins, set up a wallet, move the coins to a wallet and hope that I dont make a mistake like using Public instead of private key, or my whole investment is gone, and if I do all of that right, once I get them to my wallet there is very little places where I can sell/spend them. And don't give me that argument that it is a store of value because we are discussing the case of a hyperinflation where BTC would be the replacement currency. 
* Some would say I would buy it because it is a store of value, to which I say Bullshit. A store of value does not drop 85% in price in one year. Yeh, who knows, maybe next year it will 10x and make us all a lot of money, but its still not a store of value, because your top is someone else's entry point. It is just too volatile to be that.
You are getting mixed up here. Bitcoin is a technological breathrough, yes, but it is not ready to replace the current monetary system yet. It's a new asset we can speculate on, and hopefully make money off of because we took the time to understand it and bet on its potential success. But it is too early to expect it to replace well established store of value assets on the market, or become a global currency.
This is my opinion in the end, and I am not willing to debate this any further. If you want to bet your life savings on it and hope you sell your bitcoins for 5 million each next year, then more power to you. I can't stop you if I wanted to, so good luck with that.

So do we expect the price to 2x every month from now on? Ok, let me wear my spacesuit.

I'm not sure if you are serious, or joking, but let me tell you why this "modest climb" is impossible to happen.
Current circulating supply for bitcoin is: 18,079,325 BTC
If One BTC is to reach 5,000,000$, the market cap for Bitcoin will be at a whopping:  $90,396,625,000,000
That is 90 Trillion Dollars. To understand how large that is, the US Stock Market Cap is 30 Trillion, Gold's total market cap is 8 Trillion, The US GDP is around 20 Trillion. Do you understand how much value should Bitcoin capture to get to 5 million per bitcoin.
Now ask yourself this, How can bitcoin capture all of that value in less than 13 months??
It's ok to wish for a couple of X'es off your investment, or believe that Bitcoin will be very valuable in the future, but don't be fooled into thinking it will get to 5 million in a year. McAfee is the last person you should listen to in this space. He fucked over so many investors during the 2017 bull market by shilling shitcoins that worth shit right now, namely XVG, Bitcoin Private .. among others. He's an entertaining guy to follow, but he is only after personal profit. Even when shilling bitcoin like this which of course won't get him anything directly, he is gathering a new batch of gullible investors to shill a new wave of shitcoins to, when the market is blooming again.
