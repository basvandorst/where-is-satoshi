Please oh please bring that 80% correction, I want to load up real bad

Switching costs between cryptos are very high due to existing network effects. It will be very very difficult for some other crypto to over take Bitcoin unless it's 10x better in multiple parameters

Cause the car looks like Tata Nano?

But the difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks right, so the block will still get mined every 10 mins
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:35:38
noob question - so if for some unforeseen reason, miners drop out and hash power decreases, does the difficulty adjust downwards so that avg block time is still 10 mins?

What if someone were to buy coins from exchange like Coinbase and then use them for other purposes. They came from the exchange so it's the exchange's responsibility to see they're clean and not the buyer's
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:08:54
Ok but how is 'block weight' defined? I'm presuming they don't actually weigh the electrons
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:12:49
A relative noob question. The blockchain is ~150GB and would grow by leaps and bounds as adoption increases. is there a possibility that the consensus evolves to prune old transaction data without affecting wallet balances to keep the blockchain from getting unwieldy. Or is this technically infeasible as in the wallet balances and transaction data are deeply interwined?

The noob isn't the guy who didn't buy at 11k. It's perfectly reasonable not to catch a falling knife. The noob is the guy who wanted to buy at a correction but bought at the peak.

You know if there was a service that could determine the average holding period of Bitcoin wallets and if they period was getting shorter every week, you could be pretty sure it's going to crash eventually.

Long back they did something on "Internet money"

Yes, but I'm not talking about value. What would be the impact on it's utility as a medium of exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:31:43
which exchange is that?

Wow.. just saw someone tipping in a Bitcoin thread and I thought this is 2013. If coin tip bot works, this will be phenomenal and more Bitcoins can be spread around increasing power of the network.
I bow.

I'm frankly kind of disappointed. I had hoped this is the prophecied 80% crash that comes once a few years and allows more people to get in cheap. Stupid thing bounced back after only 50% down.

Actually it was an internet bubble in some sense. Many companies that laid undersea cables - literally connecting the world network- sold those assets for pennies on the dollar. It was much later that that investment became justifiable.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:50:22
Yeah, all I hear is there are rules-rules-rules and this and that which will not impact the underlying price. 
While it's true that futures are cash-settled, they are also an important signaling mechanism for the multitudes of small-folk who'll take the cue from CNBC, et al, where the futures price will be referenced non-stop.

@_date: 2017-11-27 08:25:25
I'm with you on this. I believe this whole 9-10x expansion in 1 year is happening because of large-scale buying with unsavoury intentions. The futures launch will be the key inflection point.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:14:29
While I want to agree with you, what's to stop them from doing this?
 Yes there will always be only 21 million BTC but nobody knows who owns exactly how much. We have public addressees but you can't put a face to every single one of them.
 What if JPM claims tomorrow that they own 1 million BTC through several associates and are writing a futures contract for the same at $2000 less? How would you actually counter them?

This is the most beautiful thing.. truly the arrival of the promised gold in a digital form outside CB control :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:58:35
I concur and would like to add to point
Bitcoin has shown tremendous resilience after crashes. But now, it's become almost mainstream with business news TV and pink papers talking about it. It's the first time since the FED and other CBs successfully manipulated gold that they have a real threat to their conduct. The CME futures approval is another step in that direction as it gives them a "legitimate" tool to manipulate the next biggest threat after gold without being too obvious about it.
So here's my take, the last leg of the pump will happen within first few weeks of commencement of futures trading. Then will come the final dump, which will not be just a profit measure, but a real attempt at "killing off" Bitcoin in the minds of regular people (not real enthusiasts mind you). But since Bitcoin is resilient with the existing network it's biggest intrinsic value, it will survive. After that survival, it won't surprise me if it doubles every year for the next 10 years coinciding with the final popping of the credit bubble.

Agree with almost everything except that risk of a bug in Bitcoin core goes down everyday.
Basically the risk of a bug being found any particular day is low but on a cumulative timeline, doesn't it always increase?
 I like the zerohedge quote in this context

@_date: 2017-11-27 08:01:52
Is it possible this large 10x runup in 1 year is due to the likes of JPM, GS and all the rest of the Wall street discreetly buying to prepare for futures launch?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:47:02

Interesting take
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:20:07
Has this kind of price acceleration been seen before or is it the really deep pockets buying in anticipation of futures contract launch?

If you believe all Nobel economics prize winners are super smart geniuses, I have a bridge to sell to you. Social sciences academia is one of the biggest groupthink clusterfucks out there. In this case, this is kind of their subject matter as it deals with economic incentives as well,
