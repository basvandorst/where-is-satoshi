The US dollar has accountability and recourse and it is constantly being arbitraged to uphold the law of one price rule

What if I'm making a site that is more fair for people as far as odds are concerned. A site where people will have literally a 1 in 4 chance of winning. This is in a state where online gambling is legal. They're main concern is unfairness and suspicious activity. This site will not be sketchy or hidden. That's the point. It's making online gambling more fair for people. It's even educating the masses about Bitcoin, a currency that was used for sketchy transactions. This will eliminate the dark side of bitcoin and also improve online gambling as a whole.

well first of all you dont even know what the idea is...so how would you know if it is new or not.
I'll give your site a look thanks.
Do you know how bitcoin gambling sites currently are up and running? There are a bunch

what do you mean?
@_date: 2015-07-05 23:35:37
Does it change anything if the site was not poker? What if the site operated as an exchange first. By that I mean a site that allowed people to turn cash into btc, gamble with the btc, and turn that btc back to cash, all instantaneously and in the same place.

No worries. I appreciate the help. I understand the difficulty but is it actually illegal to create a site that allows people to gamble with bitcoins, and where are those laws written. That is my main question.  
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:18:39
but are there any laws that actually prevent it right now? im also trying to find out if you would need a regular gambling license (because its bitcoin that youre gambling not cash)

Hold the phone guy, the majority of Bitcoin owners are adults. For every kid buying 2 BTC on his student loan there is a hedge fund buying 1000 BTC. The daily volume is billions... that's not all millennials lol
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:34:50
Just lol. Do you know how much 33% of all BTC equates to. Also keep in mind early adopters, exchanges, corporations, and hedge funds are holding for the long term. Millennials don't have that much money to spend and are ripe with debt. They will not be buying 33%. The majority of "millennials" buying are most likely in their 30s and will not be millennials in a few years. That survey is very flawed

respect brotha. If you're struggling definitely consider e-cigs and vapes. If you're a heavy smoker you can start with 12mg and work your way down. My buddy did this for a year and now he's down to 2mg/0mg. He just needed something to smoke, didn't have to be cigs, might be the same for you.
