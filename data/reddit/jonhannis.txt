You can use wireless or ethernet out of the box. Mobile data isn't difficult to setup and we have some tablets in house, but we haven't seen any demand so far and don't yet have that variation available for purchase on projectskyhook.com.

These guys may have a quick answer for you: 
They're the 'bit lawyers' and have looked into several states regulations, some specifically for the operation of Skyhooks.

Any color, as long as it's white. 
In seriousness though, several of our operators have applied vinyl skins over the top of their units. We may offer this in the future if the demand is there, but for the moment we do not.
That said, an order of 25 or more can be a custom color.

It's a matter of perspective. Someone wanting to turn their bitcoin into cash can buy a Skyhook and become an operator.
That said, the machine is Cash in, BTC out.

It's a Skyhook Bitcoin ATM. Completely open-source and under $1000. 
I'm taking questions here: 
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:06:31
Or you can email and ask for a refund, have you tried that? OP, give me your order number and I'll refund you right now (after sending an email to the associated account to verify it's you.)
Unbelievable. &lt;edit&gt; We're doing the best we can and the comparison to BFL hurts. All orders are at-will until they ship and we also have a 30 day return policy. We've had such a high demand for units that our fabricator, when they make a mistake or miss a milestone, becomes the bottleneck. I'm not trying to throw them under the bus, but that's just the way things are.

That's correct. The current acceptor hardware has a width limitation of 72mm.
But don't despair! We're putting the final touches on an updated model, to be released in July. It will accept up to 85mm wide notes. This unit will be programmed initially to accept 50 and 100 €, and with a firmware upgrade scheduled for September will also add in acceptance for 200 and 500 €.

@_date: 2014-06-28 16:53:31
I feel I should clear this up. The correspondence with had a bit lost in translation I'm afraid. 
It's either/or. Our acceptor supplier, PTI, charges us $495 for firmware development. This amount is credited back once we purchase 10 units containing this new firmware. We'd love to support Tenge, I mean, have you looked at Kazakhstan on a map? It's huge! :)
Another update relating to PTI, our acceptor manufacturer, ... they now accept bitcoin! We'll be making an announcement hopefully some time next week. They were skeptical at first, which is a healthy reaction to have, but thanks to the popularity of the Skyhook ATM they've had time to check it out and understand the benefits. We paid our first invoice in bitcoin last week!

You know, you can make some of the people happy some of the time. :)
While we're not quite turnkey, we have an open and completely autonomous solution for $999 and a fairly generous return policy for those who are in over their head.  We built Skyhook with bitcoiners in mind, who are fairly technical and can handle a bit of troubleshooting if needed (though it's rarely needed).
at $999 there's simply not any overhead for additional support staff. We do what we can with who we have, but sometimes things fall through the cracks. This is the reason exists.

Project Skyhook provides a setup guide and an optional blockchain.info wallet for each operator. Setup is not trivial since there are multiple fields to populate on the operator panel (pictured here:  ), but the trade off is the operator retaining complete control of their Bitcoin ATM.

We are planning a version 2, but no, it will not be two-ways. Our main focus is to help solve the problem of bitcoin acquisition. 
The reasoning is: Once you have bitcoins there are lots of options for spending and exchanging them, but getting bitcoins for the first time is difficult. People don't know who to trust. Having a physical device and a local operator that is accountable helps to quickly establish the trust that is so difficult to establish through online services.
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:25:20
Our customers are mostly international. They're using our Skyhooks in businesses, at street fairs, farmers' markets and bitcoin meetups. I've been taking a version of it to our Portland Bitcoin Meetup since fall of 2013.
Skyhook ships with a security cable and a mounting plate, so it can be tethered or bolted down to a countertop.
I've designed the unit to be versatile, not contradictory. People who buy a Skyhook to run at their local business typically bolt it down using the mounting plate. If they're buying it for less permanent use they typically would not use the mounting plate and choose to use the steel cable, or nothing at all. Here are a two midwest installations (installed today actually!) that might give you a better idea of how one might use a Skyhook. goo.gl/0jGImw
 and  also come to mind. The operators of these devices change location continually. Skylar is located in Vancouver, BC and makes it to all the bitcoin related events and Summer is the first Bitcoin ATM in North Dakota and will be moved around every so often to different locations around the state.
Skyhook is Cash in, BTC out.
All good questions. Let me know if you have any more.
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:04:35
It weighs 30 lbs (13.60 kg). Bitcoin accepted.

Aaarrr. We're listed all over the place. Working on a solution to help any Bitcoin ATM, Skyhook or not, get listed on the various Bitcoin ATM Locator sites that have popped up over the last few months, but this requires an API for each. (Looking at you coinatmradar).

We recommend using the 'bitcoin lawyers' Nesenoff Miltenberg ( for legal advice. They've looked into a number of states and may have a quick answer for you.
Since every state is different and there is currently no precedence for vending machine style Bitcoin ATMs, it makes sense that you've had difficulty finding a starting point.

It's a physical limitation with the current model, yes, but an updated model is being released next month (not announce yet, so keep it down :)). This newer model is only for currencies with a bill width of 72mm or more.

Here's our pricing structure: Units 1-10 are $999, 11-50 are $949 and 51-1000 are $899. I'm sorry that no one got back to you.
General Bytes looks like a reasonable solution for the time being, as long as they're working towards becoming open source. If we can't keep up with the features that you feel are necessary, use a different solution. 
It's not us vs them, so it shouldn't be framed that way. If a bitcoin atm solution exists that you're happy with, use it. We don't care if it's us or someone else. The goal is bitcoin acquisition.
If we weren't primarily focused on solving the problem of bitcoin acquisition we'd be charging $2,500 per unit, closing our source and marketing an inferior product that lacked openness and accountability.
@_date: 2014-05-11 07:56:51
We definitely care about compliance since a lack thereof in more restrictive jurisdictions affects the overall utility of Skyhook. We're currently following an optional module proposed by one of our customers who is looking into using a Jumio for AML/KYC.

hmm, well we do check our email. info We've shipped several units out to Australia. We're also looking at fabrication in NSW with another long time bitcoiner who resides there to further reduce shipping costs.
@_date: 2014-10-18 18:24:58
No, no GBP. It requires a new case and is cost prohibitive to develop since shipping and VAT are so darn expensive. Still, the software side is complete, it's just a case limitation which causes an economic limitation. Early on in development we were in contact with a production team in Poland, but they ended up not being reliable.
Still, it could be a good opportunity for someone.

hmm, there's something wrong here: 
I see problems with scale and pixelization.
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:09:03
The point I'm trying to make is fairly simple:
Paying down the principle does not reduce the amount of interest cast into the original amortization.
Sure you can speculate on the strength of USD v BTC and develop strategies there, but none of those strategies should be aimed at principle payment unless its 1 lump sum to pay off the entire principle.
Its discouraging to see 'B' as an option since it shows that there is a misunderstanding of the fundamentals.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:54:26

Ebay to expand the range of digital currencies it accepts
Ebay is preparing to expand the range of digital currencies it accepts and said that its payments unit PayPal may one day incorporate Bitcoin.
“Digital currency is going to be a very powerful thing,” John Donahoe, eBay chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times.
The ecommerce group, which has more than 124m active users, is initially focusing on incorporating reward points from retailers’ loyalty schemes into its PayPal wallet.
“We are building the container so any retailer could put their loyalty points into the PayPal wallet,” Mr Donahoe said.
“There is a limit to how many cards you will carry, or remembering what points you have or don’t have,” he said. “But in a digital wallet, you can put 50 different loyalty cards.”
Mr Donahoe said Ebay was not expanding the PayPal wallet to include Bitcoins, “but we are watching it”.
“That same technology could accept other digital currencies,” he said.
eBay’s efforts raise the possibility that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin may in time move beyond a niche role in online commerce. Some enthusiasts believe Bitcoin and other currencies that exist outside the traditional banking system represent the future of online payments.
The work to expand the PayPal wallet underlines the emergence of virtual payment systems as the latest front in the battle between the global technology giants, including Google and Apple, to increase consumer reliance on their products.
Corporate initiatives have sought to drum up interest in digital wallets for use online and on the high street. Companies from mobile and technology groups to banks and retailers are racing to use new mobile wallets to upend the payments business.
Most of these efforts have focused on new ways of paying with traditional currencies such as the pound and the dollar, rather than with niche mediums of exchange such as loyalty points or Bitcoin.
Bitcoin transactions are conducted through a peer-to-peer network of computers, outside the traditional banking system and largely beyond the control of governments and monetary authorities. The digital currency is accepted by very few retailers at present.
Ebay has in recent years sought to bring more large retailers on to its ecommerce platform, which started as an auction side for small traders. Ebay recently teamed up with Argos to allow customers to collect goods from 150 of the British retailer’s stores.
The ecommerce group also has a partnership with Nectar, the UK’s largest loyalty programme, allowing customers to collect points when they spend money through eBay.
Mr Donahoe said that ecommerce had yet to combine the more “utilitarian” nature of shopping online, with the “social experience” of shopping at the mall or on the high street.

Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose. One of the riskiest investments you could make.

Its much simpler than you're making it out to be. Someone walks in with a smart phone, they grab a soda, you scan it and display a qr code for that amount at your btc receiving address. they scan the code with their camera and use their smart phone to complete the transaction (with blockchain app or whatever.)
You get a confirmation on your address that xxx has been received. That's it.

Lol, you have the kind of problems people want. "Who should I give money to?" Pay for their house... Buy it from them and let them rent for a reduced rate. Don't hold their greed against them. They can't help it. It's part of being human.

What was nice about this article was that he could copy and paste entire paragraphs from his April 2013 article.
Its actually refreshing to see such a violent opinion against bitcoin. Anything to counteract the get-rich-quick mania that's in progress.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:43:05
Real or not, did the CIO mention bitcoin specifically? I saw that the author used the buzz word 'bitcoin' but that's it. If I'm wrong please show me the statement with the CIO mentioning bitcoin by name.

Perhaps his involvement with google ventures and related startups required him to sell in advance of something coming down the pipe... Then again, I may be overestimating the amount of insight that many VCs who are buying right now have.

I'm afraid this is something that people don't need. Your product has been leapfrogged by smart phones.
I brought this up on another 'hardware wallet' thread and was met with criticism about making this simple enough for grandma.
The thing is, grandma still writes out checks at the grocery store.
something that is provably secure like the blockchain.info site is good enough. The clarity of focus in the app's design will follow.
Perhaps the Trezor engineers should start working on a cheap open PoS instead.

inconceivable! You know, more to the brave and noble mpkomara's point, a number of services are being built up to transact behind the scenes in bitcoin, but only show the end user dollars so that they feel comfortable. Its about the protocol and that protocol's utility, not about impractical ideologies.

Google ventures put money into ripple because nobody's perfect. I blame it on David Prager and a few other formerly clueless VCs... They won't make the same mistake again, especially since they've had a chance to get to know the ripple team.

I don't mean to make light of emotionally abusive parents, but honestly, a guilt trip shouldn't phase you. 
Look at my suggestion. He owns their house and 1. saves the parents money on their mortgage. 2. gains a good investment. 3. maintains leverage.
This is the most pragmatic solution. A mutually beneficial arrangement with the added benefit of putting the parents 'at his mercy'. Check and Mate.

This is my complaint as well. The target demographic isn't filling a hole with food and guns.
Another note, when asked about exchanging to/from fiat he replied, "you don't have to". Well, you kind of do unless you're Roger Ver. People generally get paid in USD in the US. Roger could have given some closed loop examples instead of sounding (sorry for this) like a snob.
I support Roger and BTC and want to see it succeed. To frame it as a libertarian currency is unnecessary and a hindrance to widespread adoption.
Next time get Gavin.

The price is irrelevant. NPR guy is right. Don't buy bitcoin, yet. It will find stability over time, but its too risky atm... you can, however, still transact in btc without holding bitcoins for a risky amount of time. Buy in and spend immediately. Significantly less fees than CC or PayPal.

Mr Ham did ok, but he misunderstood much of what I said and was way off on the 'keys to the castle' quote. I was explaining the security considerations for the vending machine when I said that. Oh well, he could have done so much worse. I believe I said Ponzi while talking to him. At least he didn't fixate on that and get that bit wrong.
Nice guy, but he just wasn't able to put it all together.

Here's bitcoin today. 
"Bitcoin, go climb that tree and kill that cobra! Dang it bitcoin, what's wrong with you?"
As far as viewing it as a currency, you need to look at the protocol instead of the price. It is a more efficient medium of exchange and a more reliable unit of account than the traditional banking system provides. Whether its bitcoin or something similar, its coming. The talking heads don't get it, but ask someone who understands the fundamentals. Even Krugman is warming up to it lately.
