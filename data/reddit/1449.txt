I'm just basing the existence of the company on its Terms of Service. I haven't actually done a corporate search. There are many many jurisdictions which use "Ltd" and it could be incorporated in any of them. The company has a substantial US presence so I'd expect a registration in at least one US state. I imagine they have blandly-named US LLCs to hold their recently-raised investment funds.
Anyways, I admit I don't know anything about whether a company can be ordered to change its name if it's inherently confusing to the public (absent the trademark situation). There are many companies named after things -- News Corp, Apple Inc, Amazon Inc -- but "blockchain" is in a different class as those...

Extremely deceptive and possibly defamatory headline from somebody who is upset and knows nothing about bankruptcy proceedings.
These are coins that were admitted to be owned by Gox in the bankruptcy proceedings and are part of its bankruptcy estate. These **aren't** the coins Gox claimed were stolen which led to it filing bankruptcy in the first place.
Other than assets that receive preferential treatment for whatever reason, a debtor's bankruptcy estate can be used to pay Gox's attorneys with court approval.
Using the word "laundering" implies that MK is receiving a cut of the legal fees his attorneys are petitioning the court to take from the estate. If so, that result in the attorneys losing their licenses and possibly going to jail. As such, the accusation is most likely false.

My TLDR of the open letter: somebody (or somebodies) named Jason King had an association with a project which people on the Internet claim was a scam and was involved in a few companies that went defunct; ergo, since Jason King of SO hasn't apparently properly filed his corporate forms this year, has made slightly inconsistent statements over the 1.5 years he's been publicly active and doesn't answer every question posted to him about his operation (because -- God forbid -- maybe he actually wants to *run* his operation), he must be guilty of something.

ISIS has nothing to do with it. There is a current glut in supply.
US production has skyrocketed in the past few years (overtaking Saudi Arabia recently as the largest producer). On top of that, OPEC -- at the Saudis' behest -- has not lowered output.
Saudi Arabia's reason for not lowering production is unclear. They may be trying to force US shale oil producers out of business (many of whom have more expensive production costs) or they may be trying to harm Iran (a big regional adversary). The Saudis do not seem to care that other OPEC countries will likely see their economies and governments destabilized with oil this low until the next OPEC meeting in June so their geopolitical reasons for their stance must be important (to them).

This Google Docs based attack has been known for months; it's especially dangerous because it uses a legitimate Google SSL certificate (it's actually just a Google Doc). There were articles about it back in May. Of course, most users have no idea about it as it hasn't been well-publicized and Google hasn't done anything to warn its users of this attack (or apparently eliminate the danger). 
Especially if you're expecting the document from somebody you know, you probably won't think anything of inputting your password; yeah, it seems strange but nobody can be 100% on it all the time.

The company that owns blockchain.info is... Blockchain Ltd. They're referring to themselves "correctly" and can't be legally accused of being misleading when they say "being a Blockchain user"...
It maybe wasn't originally intended to be confusing but the company has used the confusion to its advantage.

Eh, bitcointalk.org was needed when bitcoin was a niche industry, and necessary for enthusiasts to meet and work with each other.

I have read that quantum computers can't break a private key simply by looking at a public address. But they can break the cryptography once a transaction is signed and an address's public key is exposed.... in which case a possible workaround is for people to not reuse addresses.

Google isn't actually that great when it comes to protecting users against phishes. A friend of mine had his password phished, the attacker simultaneously logged in from a location 100s of miles away and did all sorts of things my friend never did with his account. He had set up text alerts for suspicious activity and received nothing; he only found out days later.

This is true but defendants are not allowed to present any arguments for jury nullification (which you seem to be saying here). The US Supreme Court has held that judges may order such arguments stricken from the trial record and that defense attorneys may be held in contempt and thrown in jail for even mentioning jury nullification at any point.

The owner of blockchain.info is Blockchain Ltd. (no idea where it's incorporated). If I was their attorney, I would recommend Blockchain Ltd. claim a common-law trademark over the name "Blockchain" (capitalized). Blockchain Ltd. believes it's completely 100% in the legal right to use the term "Blockchain" to describe itself just like how Apple Inc. uses the term "Apple" to describe itself.
That said, CoinDesk and other virtual currency-centered publications shouldn't go along with that BS.

This is rare, especially at the "small" seed round levels. Andreesen isn't going to waste his or his firm's time managing a company he only has $50K (or even $500K) in. His firm now has a board member at Coinbase but that's only after they led an equity round worth $25MM.
Some VC firms are also incubators that help their startups get a leg-up in the world (like 500 Startups) but even that support is limited once the startup leaves the incubation.

Not entirely sure why the listing of the companies dissolved subject to tax forfeiture proceedings (assuming it's even the same Jason King). Those can be nothing more than involuntary dissolutions by the state for failure to pay yearly franchise fees; there is nothing inherently suspicious about such a dissolution and happen all the time with broke companies.

This is poorly thought-out legislation. Arbitrarily changing Bitcoin's designation from property to foreign currency may actually result in *higher* tax bills for most people, as foreign currency gains are generally treated as ordinary income, not as capital gains. 
A real world example why this is a bad idea: investors of all stripes will be much less likely to invest in the proposed Bitcoin ETF (or other investment vehicles) if their profits will be treated as ordinary income.
A *better* way to legislate this is to completely abandon the "currency/property" designation. The Internet is creating assets that have properties of both. Instead of forcing the IRS to shoehorn a given asset class into either of them, taxpayers should have the flexibility to choose how to treat various transactions as either a currency gain or a capital gain, depending on the circumstances.

MasterCard itself has little to do with the KYC-AML of its customers, so it's odd and somewhat desperate seeming that they're bringing up those issues. MC and Visa rely on their card-issuing banks to ensure their customers aren't laundering money and whatnot.

God. Mr. Hess is an idiot (and so is Sen. Coburn).
The Coinage Clause is limited to Congress's power to coin currency *from metals*.... which is why it's called COINING. It was an explicit grant of power to Congress to prevent states from issuing metal coinage (which created problems pre-Constitution).

The problem is that these security procedures are complex and time-consuming to understand... and carry fair amounts of risk for people who even know how to use them properly (how many people have forgotten passwords or seeds to their wallets?). The vast majority of people are **not** at all technologically-adept and their eyes will glaze over about when you get to the relationship between a private key and public address ("wait, what's a hash?"), not to mention Electrum wallet seeds and multi-sig wallets. Heck, the vast majority of people don't even know what 2FA is.
Bash Coinbase/Circle all you want but *simplicity* is needed -- no, required -- in bringing Bitcoin to the masses. Yeah, Bitcoin allows "you to be your own bank", but that's hard and risky... and people don't want to lose their life savings because they forgot one of the words in their 12-word wallet seed.

This comes across as, to be blunt, insecure and defensive.


Different people have been saying these things; you're attributing statements from different voices of the Bitcoin community to the Bitcoin community as a whole (and Counterparty specifically).
We get it: you have an extremely complex project to defend, one which has been subject to derision by some people in the Bitcoin community. However, throwing grenades at another company that is trying to pursue a vision that is incompatible with yours -- seemingly only because they had the audacity to use your freely-available code -- is childish.

Blockchain Ltd. (owner of blockchain.info) uses the public ledger of Bitcoin (called the blockchain) to provide information regarding Bitcoin transactions to the public in a relatively easy-to-use format. Anybody with requisite technical skill can glean the exact information blockchain.info publishes.
So the two -- blockchain.info and the blockchain -- are associated only in that blockchain.info gets all of its information from the blockchain.
