ok, educate me on this history of a currency that has been successful that is not debased.

Very good information, I really appreciate the time you have taken to explain this to me. 
The benefits keep mounting don't they '-'
Really that transparent, so it's more secure? Sounds great. This really does open the door for a new age of commerce. I see why It's catching on. Other concerns come to mind, what if this gets outdated? Like records, 8track, cassette, disk to memory card. I see with open solutions could prevent that, but if something better comes along the value of one virtual currency would drop rapidly while another increases.  Also, open solutions make me think of the difference between an Apple vs. Microsoft based product. Thanks again!

Of coarse not, there are 3 hands in the pie for every transaction. The emerchant, their contractor and the gateway. For every credit transaction a company from each level will take a %. Chargebacks sucks. But I don't understand where Bitcoins come from and how the value appears to fluctuate far to much for commerce. Are there not transaction fees when you withdraw funds? Anything over 3% would be more then merchant fees.

I'm glad you brought this up. This leads to my main concern. Your first point. 
"An increasingly large number of people can only pay with bitcoin; they currently have no access to credit/debit cards, but they would to bitcoin. So, it can only extend your market."
That concerns me, because if Bitcoins we liquid assets like cash, they would be rich. Why would someone with millions of Bitcoins be poor in dollars?

I appreciate your feed back. I need some more information to understand your point of view. War and natural disasters have been the ruin of civilizations, not their currency. What if someone hacked the system? What agency is there to track down your funds? What if we lost the internet? You can't barter virtual money. How is this more secure when there is no tracking, responsibility or accountability for what happens with Bitcoins?

Financing. We need to keep $$$ moving. Because we support the cannabis community, no one will give us loans and investors are tough. We built our brand by word of mouth and through our products performance. Turning dollars into another currency seams risky. Especially with the Bitcoin market fluctuating so much.

Thanks you! I could use some help understanding where they come from. It's been explained to me by a friend, will have to read up on it. Seams to me like they are limited and becoming harder to mine. What do you think will happen when the value keeps increasing without supply? For example, will it be valuable like gold so someone is still willing to pay $1600 a oz.

Thanks, very good to know where to look for turning them immediately into cash.

Thanks, do you have any idea how to account for this according to GAP? As a corporation, it's our responsibility to monitor inventory and account for funds at all times. I would invest dollars and receive back Bitcoins. How would that be taxed? Hmmm so many questions.

Thanks! I can't buy manufacturing parts with Bitcoins so we would need to easily convert them into cash. I see enough value to do more research. As with any currency, there needs to be people willing to use it. Sounds like there is appeal here that people have bought into. I have concerns but sounds legit.

I'm new to Bitcoin, a friend created this post to show me there is a market segment interested in using this as a currency. How liquid are Bitcoin assets?
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:25:55
Thank you! I appreciate your input and references. Are you concerned about inflation? 
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:44:01
Thanks! This is a great idea. Makes for taking Bitcoins much easier to account for!

I'm new to Redit, friend created this account and asked this question. She then said watch and see what people say. Seams like there are people using it. I'm so into cannabis and our grow lighting company, I just now learning of this trend. I think was her way of making me see the value in doing some research on it. Thanks!
