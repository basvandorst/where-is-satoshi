Agree. My coworkers literally spend $50-100 a day on food. Coffee/monsters in the morning. Then lunch. Then snacks in afternoon. Buy brand new cars, go clubbing, just money money money money for absolute bullshit. 
Then complain about how everything costs too much, inflation is too high, they deserve raises blah blah blah. 
Meanwhile I just make sure my bills are paid and emergency fund is straight,  max my 401k, spend around $8- $10 a day on eating, and put literally all of my free money in crypto.

Curious to see if they do this tome. I’m about 75% convinced alts won’t exponentially pump this time. Maybe ETH and LTC but I think the rest are going to going to see much less growth.

Can’t be too enjoyable when they’re broke/stressed out 5 days before payday, especially considering they’re making damn good money for the COL. 
Being smart with your money doesn’t mean you don’t/can’t enjoy your life.

Remember after 20k  when the TA experts were waiting on 2k. How did that go?

Lol your post from 1 year ago literally made no kind of pertinent prediction whatsoever? “Money flowing” wut
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:48:42
Works fine for me

He couldn’t talk/had to sell because his employer wouldn’t allow it?

Is this in writing? Seems like a strange thing for your ex to basically give up her child for money.

You can get an alert on a lot of the portfolio trackers but they’re super fuckin delayed and haven’t helped me swing trading at all
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:27:47
I remember all the TA “experts” since ATH  “waiting on a crash to 2k”. I think they’ll be waiting forever.

Even buying on a fiat on-ramp you’ll pay a premium

Of course
@_date: 2019-05-21 01:38:43
Its the original.

It’s very very hard timing the market.
