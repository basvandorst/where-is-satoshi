0xBitcoin is actually really cool.  It's essentially bitcoin on the ETH blockchain.

Source?  Doesn't make sense for the markets to fall simply because of a speech.

I get it, you dislike Trump.

You're pathetic, wasting your time going through someone else's comments that are totally unrelated proving that you are a bigot yourself yet again.  You scoured and attempted to cherry-pick my posts from over a month ago only to prove that you are the bigot.  What an idiot lol.  Typical braindead reddit liberal.

Too much political BS, and baseless speculation.  Doubtful.  Check this out though, looks like great news:  
  
"The combined market cap of FAANG stocks -- made up of Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc., and Google parent Alphabet Inc. -- tumbled after Trump made negative remarks about the growing power of social media platforms, a signal to some investors that the industry could soon face extra scrutiny from federal antitrust regulators."  
  
Good if true though, or you can downvote exactly what was in the article you just linked.

Who would have thought there was more than one opinion on a political matter.  I don't know you, why would I care if you pity me?  I pity you, cool story bro.
