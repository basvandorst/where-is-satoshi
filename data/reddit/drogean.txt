not really, NASCAR appeals to non-tech savvy rednecks who MIGHT think its funny but would never figure out how to buy bitcoins/dogecoins.
 Nobody outside the southern US states watches or is remotely interested in NASCAR.
The publicity stunt pretty much got the "here comes honey boo boo" viewership interested....

fuck ad block plus 
they only made their "paid by advertisers" ad list optional because people found out their little dirty secret and started giving them shit about it

People really need to research and find a trusted [Bitcoin escrow]( service to use. Every week is a new post about somebody being scanned on Localbitcoins

Dont give me that shit. The way adblock plus functioned was by enabling BY DEFAULT a "block list" that contained while list entries.
Yes a BLOCK LIST was enabled that actually did the opposite of what any right minded person would think. Unless you figured it out or read about it, who would disable a BLOCK LIST?

Similar happened to me. Opened an account. Transferred bit coins from block chain to deposit....then nothing on btc-e. Bit coins just disappeared without making it to my account.70 confirmations too. We might be fucked

Sorry to hear dude. My bit coin deposit went through last night and my coins are MIA on the site like I never sent them. Not too happy.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:47:00
I've been waiting for 3 days for my deposit with 70 confirmations. Btc-e may be a scam
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:23:46
I sent my coins 2 days ago from block chain and they got 60 confirmations last night... still not in BTC-E today.

no shit. Just being here over the last month or two there has been plenty of "I was using brainwallet when suddenly.... NOW I LOST xxx AMOUNT OF COINS! HELP"
STOP USING BRAINWALLET PEOPLE. Fuckin idiots need to RTFM, maybe altcoins will sort out the idiots for us so they just leave

I sent only. 0625 btC,about 60 bucks. My confirmation is 300 now
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:10:00
Agreed. My bit coin deposit was confirmed 70 times but no record of it on my Btc-e account. Its been 3 days
 No way to get support from a bank with bit coins so were all fucked if our coins go missing.they have no obligation to help us if you think about it

I retract my statement I finally got a message saying they fixed my deposit 3days later and its now there. Everyone needs to be aware that it may take days to see transaction s
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:32:09
My btc-e deposit was transferred 2 days ago but hasn't shown in m account yet.300 confirmations too. A quick Google search will show others with disappearing deposits too. Beware this site
Edit:. Three days later my deposit showed up and I got a response. They need a big disclaimer
