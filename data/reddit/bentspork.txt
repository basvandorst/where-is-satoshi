They make great 3D printed objects.

The gritty [details](

I'm curious what the purpose is as there is no CRC for data validation.   If it isn't required to be stored in the chain then why bother even pretending to try.

They did popularise cheap home 3D printers.  We wouldn't be where we are now without them.  Sad they got bought by the dark side.

You're misinterpreting the idea.  The mining wont change, the block chain will.
A 80 byte field can be added to your transaction, and one can store whatever you like in it.   One would think that this data would be stored permanently in the blockchain. However the data is optional and can be thrown out by miners,  that is one doesn't need to keep it in the block.
I made the leap: If it isn't required to be stored then how does one verify the original content?  If you can't verify the content then what is the point of including it in the blockchain.   Perhaps then I thought that a 2 byte CRC could be used that would match the 80 bytes, and this data could be stored in the chain.  Then when one included data in the block that everyone forgot you could prove that you have the original data.

When they cross ship they pay the brokerage and duty. (I believe)
It is a common thing for companies with distribution warehouses scattered all over the place.  (I know)

I don't see why not.   The chances of charge backs are approximate &lt; 0.

Good stuff.
Looks like a well thought out scam.  A little vague on the details, a little too high on the interest.

It is expensive and time consuming to mill a block of aluminum.

Did someone find a humans email address at PayPal?  I'm curious how this works.

They are shipping orders taken last summer now. Op ordered 50 weeks ago.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you're a bot that is learning English.

Some fun links there.  Where was this 'investment' fund first posted?

That is amazing.   I've never seen that technique before. [ Link to research paper ](

This is why I fear we're in a temporary anomaly.   10 is just as possible as 10, 000 by year end.
Rampant growth amongst a small population is very dangerous. 
I hope I'm wrong.

I'd do it for only 25% of the value of the wallet.  To be taken at a time of my choosing.

How accurate are your prices after conversion from usd-btc-usd?  I looked up the Bitpay exchange rate (BBB) and it seems stable, if generous.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:20:56
That is a grade comment.
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:43:51
My anecdotal numbers suggest fewer than that.   I'm thinking 0.001% is being overly generous.

It is closer to 8k, and it is in a alternative currency.  This is very interesting as they will have to pay taxes on their earnings. 
I think it is a win win situation.  Publicity all around.  I think this deserves more hype.

I think merchants will have to enabled the bitcoin option manually.   It is cool seeing the worlds largest ecommerce/storefront integrating bitcoin as a payment method. 
Didn't they promise they were going to do this a few weeks ago? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:25:47
Silly question.   What if I want to keep the bitcoins and not convert them to dollars?  Or is that a bitpay question?
*edit*: bitpay has the option to keep bitcoins or auto convert.  Cool.
