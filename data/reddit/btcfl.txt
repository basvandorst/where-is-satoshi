Right now, VC's are generally investing in companies that build the infrastructure for bitcoin use. For example, companies such as Circle, Coinbase, or itBit are developing platforms to allow wide spread use of bitcoin. Investment in bitcoin I think is happening through individual users. I'm not too sure on which, if any, big institutional investors are buying bitcoin. I am sure most are waiting to get a clearer picture on the regulatory landscape.

A lot of powerful interests will lose money if Bitcoin succeeds. As with any truly revolutionary idea, the people who benefit from the status quo will do everything they can to ensure it continues. For example, most credit card companies can and will lose a lot of money if bitcoin succeeds.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:43:13
Right. I think most VC's are betting that improvements in infrastructure will encourage more people/companies to use bitcoin, thus, gradually lead to an increase in price per bitcoin.

Good analysis, but a lot of risk in the present system. You confuse demand for money with velocity of money.

There is definitely a strong movement to ban cash. Cash allows transactions to happen anonymously.

Bitcoiners should not dislike Blythe. She is bringing wall st, hence big money, into bitcoin. Yes, she is credited with creating the credit default swap. and yes, that is once of the derivative products that caused major problems in 2008 and will cause much more problems in the future. But as a bitcoiner, i think people such as blythe bring incredible amounts of exposure to the blockchain, thus, btc, and attracts big institutional investors to potentially invest in bitcoin, such as J.P. Morgan(where she was the number 3 or 4) who would not have otherwise invested in bitcoin. Good news in my book.

Yes I am aware. From what I've read, it doesn't seem practical. Even if it is, I still think even talking about a blockchain is still productive.

Im not too sure if bitcoin is the answer for this quite yet. This sheriff is asking these credit card companies to stop processing payments for backpage due to potential prostitution. If the media picks up that backpage is now using bitcoin, the media will tie prostitution to bitcoin. It doesnt help with widespread adoptiom.I'm all for bitcoin adoption in all business, but perhaps businesses that are more traditional first.

I have been impressed with bitcoin's price. Despite a Greek "deal" and China's "recovery", the price has remained relatively constant. I thought once those things happened the price would regress back to $250.

If im not mistaken, I am pretty sure you will have to pay a fine to whoever manager your 401k if you decide to move the money. But, I do think your much better off in gold, silver, art, real estate. Anything but equities.

you're right
@_date: 2015-07-02 15:32:01
Good points. I hope you are right. I would love to see upper middle class chinese use bitcoin. Let's just hope government doesn't crack down on bitcoin in that case. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:34:12
Why would Chinese put money from QE into bitcoin? If QE does happen in China, which it is in a way(lowered RRR, lending rate), wouldn't chinese investors put that money into equities? Shanghai Compisite, Hang Seng, and other indices would go up fast and I would think investors would get a higher return on equities than on bitcoin. Or does he think QE will spook the market and would lead people to bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:59:55
Chinese citizens plus the PBOC are buying gold at record rates right now. I want them to invest in bitcoin, but I just dont know if it will happen yet. I think wealthy chinese will continue to push global property bubbles around the world, accumulate more gold, buy art work...

I disagree that Lawsky wont benefit financially. He is opening up his own shop. If major businesses want to understand Bitcoin regulation, who are they going to call? You can bet it will be Lawsky's new firm.

@_date: 2015-07-02 15:10:14
True, but were talking about billions of dollars. Say they transfer money to London or NYC. Its going to be hard to convert bitcoin back into fiat to buy property or whatever. No exchange can handle that large of a sell order. I just dont see wealthy chinese investing in bitcoin to hold rather than just convert immediately back to fiat.

I think you oversimplify who bitcoiners are. Second paragraph is irrelevant to what i am saying.

@_date: 2015-07-02 14:45:37
Right, so money is sloshing around in china due to currency controls. Thats why equities are so high, wasted investment in real estate, etc. But I think wealthy chinese, who are the people buying real estate in places like NYC, Toronto, Singapore, etc. are using "illegal" means to get their money out. Capital controls dont necessarily apply to wealthy chinese. To switch to bitcoin as their modus operandi will take some type of push. Only thing I can think of is if gov. cracks down on that type of illegal activity. But doing so will piss off a lot of elite chinese.
