Nope not a malware. I can reproduce that issue on my machine too. Just take a bitcon address, add "bitcoin" in the front and generate QR code for it. Then scan using Blockchain and observe that it fills the box with a different address.

Hey I can reproduce this issue. 
This is both a Blockchain.info and Coinbase issue, but if I was an aviation accident investigator, I would call the Coinbase bug a "cause" whereas the Blockchain.info bug is a "factor".
Coinbase's app seems to be generating a corrupt code during the video that you took. The format they use is "bitcoin&lt;address&gt;", but [BIP21]( clearly states it should be "bitcoin:&lt;address&gt;" (note the added colon). So the main blame is on Coinbaes (surprise).
Guess why you can't reproduce it today? Coinbase updated their app last night, and didn't even bother to hide the issue: 
What's New in Version 2.7.6
In our effort to be the best platform for buying and selling digital currencies, we've made several bug fixes and improvements. 
- Prevent missing colon when generating QR code from an address
I would contact Coinbase and raise hell about that bug. Such a bug SHOULD NOT have made it through to the app store. Their unit tests and QA team should have caught it. 
I think Blockchain.info bug is a "factor" because it did not "cause" the incident, however it contributed to it by failing to properly identify a bad QR code. It should have warned you that the code you're trying to scan is not properly formatted.

As a fellow hodler, I really hope you can recover them. In the mean time, can you tell us exactly what happened so it doesn't happen to the rest of us?

I got two emails this week from Bittrex warning me that someone successfully logged into my account from Ukraine. I immediately clicked on the disable account link after I got the emails and then as soon as I got home, I enabled 2FA on it. Never risking it again. Enable 2FA people.

Can you explain how?
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:14:56
Both caused the issue. Coinbase by generating a bad qr code and blockchain by accepting it as a private key

Coinbase app update on iOS app store:

Nvm. I caught up with the other thread and apparently it's possible to retrieve them, but only OP can do it.

Yes it can, but OP needs to go through his old addressee and find the one used during the transfer. We can't recover it with the information he shared.

That is why I listed Blockchain.info as a "factor." Their web app seems to be somehow deriving a valid address from an invalid QR code. However, in my opinion, that still doesn't make them a "cause" of the issue. The "cause" of the issue was Coinbase generating a corrupt QR code, therefore I believe they should be the ones paying the user back.

I grin so hard whenever that silver ad comes up on Fox News claiming that it's the best investment. I'm like nope man

My knowledge is limited, but, in simple terms, a lot of people have put in sell orders at 4000, meaning GDAX will sell their BTC as soon as the price hits 4000 (You can tell because the red part of the graph is like a vertical "wall" at the 4000 point). So what happens in the video is that as soon as the price hits 4000, some of the sell orders get filled but due to this huge sell, the price slips to 3999.99, and the rest of orders remain because the price is not 4000 anymore (Look at the price on the top left corner and how it alternates between 3999.99 and 4000.00). This demolishes some, but not all of the "wall." After some while, the price again jumps to 4000 and takes on the wall again (some more orders get filled). This happens over and over again, until all the sell orders at 4000 are filled and the price can proceed beyond 4000 (Look how it's stuck changing 1 cent for minutes and then it suddenly jumps 8 dollars after the wall is gone). 
Someone more informed can probably give you a better explanation but that is my understanding.

Nope. Last update was Aug 03, 2017 according to iTunes...
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:29:36
Nobody except OP can get the coins back. Coinbase generates a new address every time so the addresses he shared cannot be used to get the coins. OP needs to go through his Coinbase address history ( and find the address he used at the time, then essentially recreate the steps, but this time import the wallet using the Blockchain interface. 
I've DM'd him with the instructions. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:35:19
Actually now that I think more, I agree that Blockchain.info is also a cause of the issue. In that case, they both should be paying the user back for this. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:20:57
Yep. Coinbase keeps them.

I don't think so. Your BCC has nothing to do with your BTC. You didn't pay anything for the BCC. You came upon the BCC through a series of events that did not cost you any money, therefore you got that BCC for $0/each and if the price is $300 now, you made a $300 profit on each.

Well I got an email from GDAX now that says my limits have been temporarily increased so I can withdraw all my BTC before the 1st. I went to GDAX and tried exactly that, but it says my daily limit is $11/day. Wth?
