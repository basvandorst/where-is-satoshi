I thought Doge would last a few weeks a couple months at most but already they are doing significantly more than any other crypto.    They will last, and they will not be the currency of the future in real life, they will probably reign the internet in years to come.  
I don't have any statistical numbers but does anybody have the number of bitcoin wallets vs the number of dogecoin wallets?  I think the real number of actual adopters will dictate the long term price of any crypto currency, including a joke currency based off a meme.  Remember the value of any currency in the world is based off of confidence in that currency.  Bitcoin has a lot of confidence because it was first.  Lydian was the first currency in the world.  Who here has heard of a Lydian?  I had not until I looked it up just now.  Bitcoin will be overrun by another Crypto, whether it's this year or 20 years from now is just speculation.
i watched a movie called Margin Call once.  The owner of the firm said something along the lines of 
"there are 3 ways to be good in this business
1.  Be first
2.  Be the best
3.  Cheat.
Bitcoin was first
I don't know who's the best but Doge is putting up a good fight
the new alt coins are all cheating
Doge has a better community today that bitcoin.   Bitcoin has greater acceptance.  
I don't know if I'll be saying the same thing in 2 years.
** Edit- That's my long ass response on why I agree with you.
