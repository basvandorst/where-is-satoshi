Really though, the comments are wasted breath. They are pretty cringe worthy.
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:01:32
Lol, asshat

Well I think you have to be a Coinbase user to register an app. They should have some means to track this guy down.
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:01:33
You should really consider letting the user set some limits for what they allow via oauth. For instance, a maximum transaction amount or frequency. Someone might be cool with apps making micro payments, but  they don't want a $50/charge. 
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:03:28
They gave me a lot of shit at when they were $200. That has subsided.

Don't look at the year chart, it's a little scary.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:18:12
Ok...  so why is a storage of value constrained by gdp...
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:03:09
One: You didn't invent the blockchain. Everyone knows its a ledger that can be used to keep track of things. All these ideas are just hey, we can keep track of a,b,c. Your "super awesome idea" is just one of those permutations that many many people are thinking through. 
"she told us more about how the diamond industry worked and about diamond certification."
"Her only contribution was that Ed's idea could be applied to the diamond industry for verifying certificates."
It sounds to me like you said "it could work for a," and she came along and said "hey it could work for b". If anything, you are trying to claim to her intellectual property. This is really pathetic the more I read through it. 
Also, "it could work for a,b,c" isn't really patentable IP. Maybe if you had a clever implementation it could have some protection, but it's probably a pretty breakable patent if you could even get one. I'm not sure what IP you think you even have.
These are really just markets to execute on. There are very talented people forming companies to tackle all the best markets. I don't think you are one of them, so have fun sitting on the sideline while all your "ideas" get executed by people who know wtf they are doing. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:03:04
You can buy ideas. You can buy people to implement them. Money is everything.

What, you think every promising cancer therapy doesn't have dollar signs behind it? Cancer therapies are all bought and sold. Also if you think there is a "cure" for cancer you are scientifically illiterate.
@_date: 2016-09-29 12:19:42
Seriously, it's like saying "a bad economy is a sign of a bad economy"
@_date: 2015-09-21 12:30:21
All someone has to do is try to sell it claiming it can cure cancer.

This is probably the most ignorant, myopic analysis of drug pricing I've ever seen.

People leave finance with their saved money to start businesses all the time.

The problem I have with this chart is that an exponential graph looks the same at any level.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:04:14
Bitch slow down. Be humble.
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:23:41
They employ thousands of very smart people, don't be naive.

Incoming correction to 1700. Jesus Christ.

Yeah... It's fucking crowdfunding.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:39:56
Wait does that mean you emailed them more than 50 times??
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:55:33
Ugh I can't buy more from Coinbase til Mon. afternoon
I hope it doesn't ruin the price too much by then.
Anyone want to grab me like 4-9 at this price?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:37:46
Sounds good so far. You're missing the step where you give me 5%. Other than that, rinse repeat!
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:07:35
I'll record the look on my wife's face when I say "hey honey, guess what, I bought more bitcoins with our savings account"
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:35:49
I'll buy you some from Coinbase if you paypal me the cash.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:45:21
If I had some way to hold you to your word I would buy either way! I am speculating it's going the other way 
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:40:05
Thanks guys these are nice!
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:09:06
Does it bother anyone else that the winklevii are into bitcoin. Now they speak in public like they are visionaries or something just cause that were born with 26 mil in their pockets.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:02:25
Are you kidding, this is gonna blast to 500 easy
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:32:54
Give yourself some credit, that's how. We can all say "if only", but we always make the decision that makes the most sense to us at the time with the information available. Everyone here is kicking themselves for selling, for ignoring bitcoin when they first heard about it instead of spending 15 minutes to learn, for losing their USB, etc etc etc. Hindsight is 20/20 and a bitch but you can't let the past eat you, its gone and you have the future to worry about!
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:42:16
Personally I sold a few on Thurs - I think a certain percent USD is not exactly unreasonable atm. I'm 70/30 btc/usd and I feel good
 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:06:57
Well if prices are higher next week I'll still buy them from you for 270... Does that help?
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:29:35
Cause it is not "different this time" and we are going to correct this November madness
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:38:10
Why when I could sell and increase my holdings after the impending correction...
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:26:43
I bought some a couple weeks ago and they have damn near doubled in value. Quit sitting and get in on the fun.
Just figure out how much money youd be willing to burn and buy some
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:34:55
Its my very first purchase, might be a new policy
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:24:01
just testing and I want something flashy to show off
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:24:14
You are an idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:25:16
Wait so does it fill it in or do I choose to give a certain fee with a minimum required or something?
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:49:11
Yeah so please show us your graph of percent use on drugs and gambling over the years. You seem to have collected data.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:36:07
I'm just saying come along for the ride with what don't care to lose. Its fun to watch the charts with some on the line. Also, my speculation it will double again is no worse than your speculation it will not cause neither of us fucking know. Did you miss the part where I said only what he is willing to lose.
He wants to know if he should get in on it, the answer imo is yes.
Also, this is not a penny stock and any argument for comparison weak at best.

Question - with bitpay can you choose to keep your earnings in bitcoin or do you have to receive in USD? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:25:16
Supply/Demand its pretty fucking simple. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:44:58
Are you for real? You are either 12 or 87
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:37:03
You wanna provide any evidence, support, etc to back up your rambling?
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:50:57
Check out Shopify, looks like they are working on making bitcoin an easy form of payment. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:19:52

Wtf are you taking about this was crystal clear

Sorry you and two friends can't buy a btc ATM with pocket change.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:00:31
Christ at least put a portion into bitcoin if you believe in it. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:31:23
Wait to see if the bull trap plays out, maybe evaluate again on Saturday. I think you have little to lose from waiting until then and potentially a lot to gain.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:55:22
I've always felt a little dumb putting bitcoins on paper.
Hey family have a piece of this amazing technology! Yeah you could ruin that copy by sneezing... but... no... no mom bitcoins aren't a "physical" thing, well lets start at the beginning, there was this anonymous paper published... and ...blockchain...cryptography... god my pitch needs work. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:09:37
Can someone further explain the valuation that puts it at $1.34?
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:08:32
Guys, their risk for processing your transaction does actually increase as the price increases rapidly.
They are nice enough already for trying to lock in your price when it really makes sense for them to charge you ~whatever it cost them to obtain it for you.
I agree though they could explain it before checkout.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:32:29
You really have no clue, go read up on your credit card's merchant guide. They actually suggest that merchants do in-house risk assessment in order to prevent online fraud. You guys act like these $5000 overseas impulse buys are actually normal. This is shit that should get flagged, it looks exactly like stolen card behavior.
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:06:36
Well as an example I bought one bitcoin last Tuesday from Coinbase, but I want to buy more. Turns out I have to wait for that first one to clear, which will happen Monday afternoon. So I'll probably but like 9 more then, and imagine a ton of recent adopters have a similar story
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:45:56
I feel like every single new adopter and everyone on this subreddit would ravenously buy on any substantial price drop at current prices.
I speculate we need more gains and any "pop" will hit a floor above where we are right now.
