Not gonna lie. I have 600 saved up back in 2014 at 300 per coin. I was ready to buy 2 coins im 16 now. My parents never let me buy any because they thought it was a scam. Here I am buying $20 worth at 16k

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:19:50

@_date: 2017-12-10 05:18:16
What would be the best plan to get to 1 btc? My goal is to be in the 21million club
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:56:47
Wish me luck 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:20
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:19:54
That would be my biggest goal
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:20:25
I can give it a go to get in. If I don't I still require a payment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:25:29

Generally this sub is filled with nice people. You are one of the dicks of the sub
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:38:29
What should I do?!? I want to get more bitcoin and have no way
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:46
Thx I bought at 16.3k before it dipped a little. I'm already down ���� 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:24:54
Well i have no way to buy. I had to beg my parents for weeks to let me buy. At 6.3k I had 600 in my savings. I wanted to take the risk and go for it. He said no... now I finally got him to day yes and if I invested the 600 i would have about 1.5k 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:04:55
Dipping to 100 bucks would be nice for some of us. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:32:53
When it was at 300 i begged my parents to let me buy 2 btc. Noe I would have over 14k
