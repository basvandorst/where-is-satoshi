But that is assuming the price will go down. You don't know if it will for sure, no one does. "Cutting your lose" is more like risking a loss. Holding is the safest option in the long term and if you want to do anything, buy more to increase your position for when it goes back up.

It seems arbitrary to use other people's wealth as a measure of the potential of Bitcoin. Yes there will be people who become multi-billionaires but I don't think that's relevant to the adoption of the technology itself. I think it's important to realize that this is not all about money and that the application of this technology far exceeds wealth generation. Getting caught up on how much money a few very early adopters have will just cause you to feel envious and distracted from the real meaning of all of this.

That's part of the game. No matter what decision you make you could regret it or be glad you did it in hindsight. Over time you will learn to stop stressing about losing money and you'll focus on long term goals. Until then you should just relax and pretend as if the money is already gone. That's why people always say, "don't invest more than you're willing to lose".

I mean, it will if the mods take down price posts and tell the submitters to post in this thread. What I don't like about this megathread is that it gets rid of some of the hype on our front page. I agree that having 5-10 posts on the front page is cumbersome but at least let a couple stay to get people jazzed about bitcoin, especially newcomers. Nothing wrong with celebrating imo, in fact I think it helps boost confidence and moral.

I'd imagine there is some kind of reference number for the wire that he can confirm with his bank and get back to Coinbase with. In my experience transferring money can take a week or so, but I've never wired this much money so I'd be pretty anxious.

There are no fees to buy BTC on some exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:34:44
Another point to remember is the amount of customers actually using Bitcoin to pay for their goods/services is very low so a decline in the price of BTC might have a very small impact if they hold. I've seen stats from companies who accept BTC stating it makes up &lt;1% of their payments.
I think the concern at the moment is on the buyer's side of the transaction when the price skyrockets and they miss out on gains.

That's funny because my grandpa is the most interested in my family lol. He's an old school stock and bonds kind of investor and he taught me about it from a very young age.

I had a very similar conversation with a coworker the other day. Instead of the pyramid scheme FUD he gave me this line, "I read a very good article that showed why Bitcoin is a bubble. I know people have explained why it isn't, but that article did have some great points. That's why I don't invest yet". 
These types of mental barriers are to be expected with everyday people. I mean, I don't consider myself some innovative tech savvy genius who's at the top of this "pyramid scheme" called Bitcoin, so if I'm on board we are getting closer to getting through the FUD.
One thing I want to add is that I don't think we are in the infancy anymore, I always consider myself the benchmark for main stream exposure for everything. I seem to jump in moments before something blows up after others had kicked down the doors.
Bitcoin is in Middle school right now. 2018 will be like high school: a bunch of uneducated and confused kids will be wrangled in and sat down to prepare for this next big change in their life, adulthood. The immature ones will still be immature and the mature ones will get a huge head start by taking AP courses and working on the weekends. The reason I use this as an analogy is because information is the absolute key to Bitcoin adoption and educating people will make or break Bitcoin's development IMO.

Yeah just skip the airbitz part and you have a very secure plan here. Honestly, it's not as big a deal to leave coins on an exchange for a brief period of time. Having a Ledger is a very safe way of storing your coins as long as you don't lose it or let anyone know you have it. You're on the right track my guy, good luck.

Well, you can increase your limits on Coinbase by verifying your ID and adding a bank account. When you do that switch to GDAX which is owned by Coinbase and you pay no fees.

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:54:36
Lol you sound like someone who made a really bad choice and regrets it immensely. Now you just "sit on the sidelines and watch" because you are bitter about the mistake you made and since you are invested in another crypto you spite BTC in hopes of seeing it fall so you can say, "HA I was right", all while praying the other crypto you invested in will do better. I mean, why even stick around in the hopes that it fails instead of moving on with your life? It's bitter and you're making yourself miserable.

In order to pay absolutely no fees do the following:

1. Buy with limit orders on GDAX, not Coinbase.
1. Send BTC to a wallet from GDAX.

Because tulips didn't actually have any store of value nor were they used as a medium of exchange. They are also just flowers and aren't built on top of a groundbreaking new technology. By your simple logic you'd also have to have seen the internet, smart phones, social media, etc as the same thing. Sorry you missed out man but it's not too late to jump in. You could wait for the next correction that I think is inevitable, but within a couple of years it's not going to go under $10,000 anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:53:01
Copy and paste from a previous post of mine. It's a very easy 3 step process of getting your first bitcoins and pay no fees whatsoever. Added links and more info:










An even *easier* way is to just sign up on [coinbase]( and use a credit card, but this will require fees to be paid. Still the fastest and most convenient way of getting started.
I would recommend a paper wallet if you are absolutely certain you will remember where you put it, if it is safe there, and you also protect your private key. Paper wallets are a step above entry level in my opinion, a desktop wallet or a wallet on your phone are more beginner friendly.
I appreciate your concern in case of emergencies like coinbase getting shut down or forks happening etc. You are asking good questions. As long as you take your coins off of an exchange they are yours and the exchange can no longer affect your coins. If your coins are on paper wallets during a fork you will have the equivalent amount of the new coin but you'll need to sweep the wallet to a wallet that will be compatible with the new coin. This is also a step above entry level and research is needed before taking any action before, during, and after a fork.
Good luck, man. Feel free to ask more questions I'll answer as much as I can.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:44
That was a great article. We will no doubt see a massive correction soon, the questions are how low and how long will it take to recover back to 11,000 and beyond.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:42:57
Yeah I agree, people are way too altruistic about taking coins off of exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:04:49
This is correct. Came here to say this. $÷limit price=Satoshi
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:49:30
Not if you want $100 to turn into $5,000,000 like it would have if you invested years ago. But if you want to have a reason to educate yourself about the cryptosphere and blockchain then just invest whatever you can afford to lose. This is also a good way to learn in depth financial and investment concepts that can be transferred to tradition and safer investments. Don't think about getting rich quick, instead think about growing your wealth over decades of time and let investments become a routine in your life. Bitcoin is a great way to start down this path in my opinion because what you see in a couple of months is what you'd see in years of traditional Investments like index funds (although there is little correlation about how the specifics of these works under the hood but it's similar in the way you should think about them).
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:42:10
Ahhhhh I see now, I just needed to hear it worded differently. He's basically using a BTC escrow account to make some gains before taking what he needs for day to day purchases. I get it now, good strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:09:27
No you didn't lose anything. Coinbase still has your (and my) BCH. They said they are releasing it in early 2018 I believe. When a fork happens you still have your original BTC *and* the equivilent new coin. I think that's a confusion you might be having.
This is why some people consider forks "free money" because they require no attention from holders. You just have to find a wallet that is compatible with the new coin and export your private keys to claim them. This can be done at anytime but typically people try to get them ASAP to sell them for more BTC. Thus free money.

Well, in order for an investment of $600 now to equal $1,000,000 in 2020 the price of BTC would have to be ~$4,770,384 which won't happen. But, you would likely still profit quite a bit but you wouldn't be able to retire or anything like that. If the price reaches $10,000 by 2020 which might be a low expectation but honestly seems like a safe bet, then your $600 would be worth ~$2095.

You basically put in your offer at a certain price and the trade occurs when a seller matches that price. Could take time for it to happen and it can't be adjusted once you submit it, only cancelled.
