Haha. Well when you put it THAT way ;)
Seriously tho, the post isn't about any gambling addicition or not. Even if it were, it wouldn't change the fact the 'provably fair' absolutely isnt, until you tell them you're watching them.

When I say you can't beat the system, I mean that there is no "winning" strategy that will always work. In the 2nd post in the bitcointalk thread, I go into huge detail on how the odds always work themselves out.
What you CAN do is find a moderately safe technique that nets you big wins, and if you're lucky (and in this sense, I WILL use the word*) you get out before the hammer falls. You beat the system by not bowing down to it. You run it, hit it, hope those odds you cannot escape don't nail you, and get out.
Its why I was so stunned at the initial losses. Mathematically it made NO sense. It just, kept, losing. Over, and, over. And no balanced an fair system works like that.
As for the "you seem smart, why gamble?" - it's fun. I'm a long term bitcoin hloder and while I hope my coins skyrocket to $5000+ each, I also realize there is a very real chance they won't. So they are easy to gamble. If I win and the price goes up, hell yeah. If I win and it goes down, hey, it's more than I had. If I lose and the price goes down, well, I just lost even less. If I lose and the price goes up... well... that REALLY sucks.
Given those 4 possibilities, 2 are good, 1 is neutral/good, and 1 sucks. Not bad odds.
So, it's easy to play with bitcoin instead of "real" money. (In just try to not think about what I could have sold lost bitcoin on coinbase or circle for ;)

Never complained a system did not work.
I complained that 999dice.com is cheating, and once I stopped them from cheating by requesting the server hash before every bet, I immediately started winning again, and then was banned from the site.

Wrote a plugin script to auto-pull the server hash for 999dice. Script and details here:

No worries. Not upset or anything. I gamble knowing full well I may lose money. And in the past I have. I don't gamble anything I'm not prepared to lose.
But being stolen from is a whole other story. 
As for sketchy gambling sites, one reason I play on bitcoin dice sites is they CAN'T cheat. They cannot fake rolls. Yes it's on me that I didn't verify first (thing is - if I DID verify, it WOULD have). It wasn't until I started digging that I noticed how he does it. It's why I call it beautiful. Truly, it is. It's a genius, elegant, sexy bit of trickery. Who would ever suspect he's cheating? He gives you the hash. You can validate the seed. You can calculate the exact same number the site shows.
But only AFTER you tell him you are going to.
I requested the seed a few times, before the losses got massive. Never dawned on me until I really looked, what was happening.
And thats why I called it beautiful. Giving you the hash and validating every bet, while cheating like mad.

I'm sure he did, though, I wouldn't call using a brain and math hacking ;)

Kudos to you sir. Reading that give my first good laugh of the day.

The first investment request I got I ignored, assuming it was some scam or some website thing they were raising money for. Then a while later I was reading up about different betting sites and reading about people's "99.9% win strategies!" and came across a youtube video somewhere where someone was explaining a martingale strategy, and in there, he said something about "Now this .2 BTC I'm using was an investment &lt;blah blah&gt; I'll win it up to .25 BTC and return .23 and keep the .02 &lt;blah blah&gt;" and thats when I realized what all the investment talk was in the chat room.
Hey, people, the only advantage that guy MIGHT have over you betting your own money is if he keeps his emotions and feelings of luck out of it.
And considering he's a person, exploiting YOUR money, I doubt it. I'd imagine you'd bet a hell of a lot more recklessly with someone else's money.

Because since I bet larger than average, all he has to do is flag all new accounts that have high balances or high volume for manual release of withdrawal. Given betting style, my use of the api (the way I was betting with it would take FOREVER to do manually on site) - and the biggest giveaway of all? If I were to bet there again, you can be damn sure I'd be recording the hash before EVERY bet.
Balance/volume, new account, likely tor because you only have so many IP adresses at home/work/etc, and doing what no one ever does - requesting the hash?
He'd know it's me.
Unless everyone starts validating the hash. In which case I doubt the site would be around much longer anyway. Loss of profit and all that.

Its a bitcoin dice betting site. They are under no one's oversight. Hence the cheating. There's no license to revoke. Anyone who set their site up like that would ever bother to get a license anyway.

He banned me, *I BELIEVE* (can't prove) because I figured out his scam. I lose 207 BTC in shockingly massive amounts of "bad luck". I figure out how he's doing it, and how to STOP it. I request the hash before every bet. And 3 betting sessions later, I am UP 61 bitcoin.
He banned me because I forced him to play fair, and he started losing bitcoin. I DID do statistical analysis. I ran literally hundreds of millions of bets through a simulator to know just how to bet, and how much. I was not running 50/50 2 BTC bets to win. I was running THOUSANDS of smaller, low-to-moderate risk bets which, when you run 135,000 of them, wound up being about 9.8 BTC per run, with about a 4% chance of a loss of about 48 BTC. Something along those lines.
You log in, deposit 50, hit that 135k bet run three times, withdraw 80 BTC 9 minutes later?
A casino with a .1% edge will, long term, win money. But when someone knows math, knows how to run numbers, they have a better chance at winning and getting out before the shit hits the fan. Which I did, three times, winning 61 bitcoin back.
If he didn't stop me, I'd eventually have gotten the other 146 back, and after being cheated, you can be damn sure I'd have gotten more.
Casino's profit from their edge, and from emotional betters believing in luck. 999dice has no edge worth writing home about, and I believe in math.
And once I forced him to stop cheating, I started winning.
That is, I believe, why I was not only banned, but THREATENED with confiscation of my deposits.
