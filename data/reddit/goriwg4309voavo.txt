Here's how: 
1. XAPO.com - create an account
2. Order debit card
3. Wait a week or two
4. Card shows up. Activate it online with third party provider. Balance will always show 0. Send some XBT to your XAPO wallet. 
5. Buy stuff anywhere you normally would using a VISA card.
I just got this thing, and it's super cool. More testing is needed but it is definitely worth trying.
Update: made a few more purchases from different merchants, every transaction was seamless. For small amounts sometimes you don't even need the PIN. Awesome!

Cool, nice to know cash will always be easily accessible. Have you tried it with ATMs in different countries? I'm thinking this will be a great way to get local currency.

Good to know about ATMs, I'll try that out next. Chip &amp; pin on the merchant terminal was no different from any other card - no problems at all.
Is the fee the same for ATM withdrawals? It was 3% on this purchase.

Nice, if I were in Canada I would try it!

I've used it at several places now that take VISA, not a single issue. I understand it's supposed to work everywhere VISA is normally accepted.
As far as shipping and fees, I paid nothing - just opened a Xapo online wallet (trusted them with my info, but no XBT) and they sent me a card. I paid 3% fee on each purchase so far. I don't know about monthly fees, but so far I've seen nothing about that. I also would be very likely to ditch the card if there were monthly fees - that's just silly.
