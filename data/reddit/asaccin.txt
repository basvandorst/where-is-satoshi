Me too. Try Nicehash. I get just under $1 per day and remote shut down when no sun. A 1080 gaming GPU will burn through 300watts mining, so I make sure my panels are creating that before switching it on.

Yeah, that seems reasonable for a 1060.

I work as a Blockchain Consultant and some people just don't want to know about it. However, this really is life changing technology and businesses are really starting to develop with it. We are! 
Bitcoin is also the real deal, but both will take a number of years to really be known to all. Hang in there - this will go mainstream in the next year and you'll be seen as the insightful one.
One word of advice - the industry is mainly building on Bitcoin and Ethereum. We don't see much traction for EOS, TRON, BCH etc etc at the moment. This could change, but beware speculating in alt-coins with no users.

LINK is used in the industry, mainly by Google at the moment. We are assessing it - has some good and bad points, but I can see a usage in the future for our clients.
Sorry, our developers don't do anything on Dash, Monero or DGB. The Blockchain industry is more concerned with private, permissioned systems at the moment using Hyperledger and R3 Corda without the need for cryptocurrencies.

I thought Bitcoin Cash wanted to Be Cash and that's why it's called Bcash.
