I personally don't believe in "industry’s best security practices" from Bitgo. It's only a marketing... multisig for hot/cold wallet is not a rocket since... every senior programmer + system administrator can read the book by Andreas Antonopoulos, watch his 50 minutes video, and implement it as securely as bitgo does.

@_date: 2016-06-09 19:11:07
