Man, I can't remember exactly HOW I got to them to where they responded although I think I had to make it about a problem that I wasn't really having...instead of the "transfer failed".  Maybe it was the ATM withdrawal problem link but whatever I used I got an email like the next morning that said they just needed to reset my profile or account? and that everything would work fine after that.  And Boom! it did and I've been thrilled with this thing ever since.  It is THE number one way to purchase bitcoin other than from another person, IMO.....and I love that I can make instant transfers without fail from my bank account to my cash app which comes with the black visa debit card.
\*\*Edit/update\*\*:  I went back to try and figure out my steps and came up with this:
Go to the link below after you've logged in online from a PC (not sure it has to be a PC at all....just what i did)
follow this link:
then go to:
\*\*"SOMETHING ELSE"  then "CASH CARD" then "DISPUTE A TRANSACTION" then "SERVICES/MERCHANDISE NOT RECEIVED" then "CONTACT SUPPORT"
then on the user dialogue box select
"TRANSACTION ISN'T LISTED HERE" on the dropdown menu ,then
in the "EXPLANATION OF THE PROBLEM" box just write in the message code and that you are really having that problem and this is the only way you could find to contact them...or whatever.  I did this and got an email the next morning and was fixed. Said they needed to  'reset' my account.  Total fucking bullshit to have to go through so many steps but I will say it has been fantastic since then.\*\*

Try that.  I used this method a few months ago and it is how I finally got through to them.

Can anybody actually reach these fuckers?
I get the same message everyday. Got 25 bucks on my first crack. Then the onslaught of transfer failed errors. Ive since been able to randomly get 10 dollars once and 1 dollar another time.
How can you talk to a real person or even find a way to contact about this specific question?
