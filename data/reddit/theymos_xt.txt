Wasn't the block size limit changed before? That is not set in stone, and it was reduced without consulting the miners nor users in any measurable way. I would argue that this "non consensual" block size increase is better than the action that led to 1Mb blocks. It requires more than a supermajority to take place... Unless the core team increases the block size. 
The blocks are full. There is no more room for growth and adoption, at the moment. I believe we need larger blocks *now*. I don't believe your slippery slope fallacy, you can change the block reward ***right now***, forking the github code. Nobody's going to use your implementation, though. 
I'm with the 4.6% of the hash power on the latest 1000 blocks mined. I'm willing to risk it. It's my opinion that "classic coin" is superior to the current bitcoin, as it is not dependant on the bitcoin core development team.

I understand... I think so does the 4.5% of the network's hash power, that is willing to risk it, for a block size increase. I,  too am willing to risk it. 
You think you know the other team *just* wants to hard fork the protocol. I say let them, if it's done for a better bitcoin. I trust them as much as I trust the bitcoin core development team.

I'm willing to risk the repercussions of allowing 75% of miner consensus dictate a change in the protocol. You assert the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem will collapse, I'm not convinced of that. I agree with the 4.7% of hashing power that if the current dev team does not change the block size, they *deserve* to be replaced.
I don't get how one comment, you can say that bitcoin is not a democracy (the majority rule should not change it), and on the next you say that it is a consensus system. Is more than a supermajority of miners agreeing upon a change to the protocol not consensus? Because a supemajority has been the lowest threshold for change in protocol, when it's come to "classic coin", "ALT-XT" or whatever "clever" name you have for them. I don't think it helps malicious actors highjack bitcoin, because I very highly doubt that malicious actors will ever have a majority (51%) or a supermajority (66%) of the network's entire hashrate.
Just enacting change on the protocol without consulting anyone is not consensus, regardless of whether there was a backlash afterwards or not. I understand that you can't consult the community every single time a change needs to be done. 
I believe in 75% of hashing power. If it backs up a protocol, that is bitcoin... for me. The people who delivered stuff are not delivering on something very important. I want to try having more dev teams compete. Competition will make this open source project (bitcoin, that is) some good.

I'd also like to reflect on the good the current development team has done. I believe competition will do them well. And they really are going to have to face *fierce* competition.

Not everyone here can be a programmer. You don't have to be to voice concerns about the repercussions of keeping small blocks. There *have* been people working on a solution to this small block issue, but we're still supposed to STFU about it. We can't talk about how 4.4% of the latest 1000 blocks mined have been under the flag of a different team's software, a post about it *will* get removed. What will they say when it's 10%, 20%, 50%? How will this forum look like when a larger block bitcoin implementation has 75% of the latest 1000 blocks mined? 
There's other teams bringing a contribution that many people think is the only hope for bitcoin's future: an implementation that permits larger blocks. 
It's censorship under the false pretense of "promoting an altcoin". Or some bull. It's really sad that theymos has chosen to take that route.
