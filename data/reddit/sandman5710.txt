True, just disappointing to see. All I know is that segment didn’t help bitcoin’s reputation one bit
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:06:57
There was more than that. Mostly unhelpful FUD

Lol you make this yourself?

Finally a good response. All the cake comparisons are stupid because you can cut the cake into infinitesimally small pieces (continuing to add 0’s to the decimal infinitely)

I... I don’t know

At what point does Harrison Ford or Arnold Schwarzenegger enter to take on “The Corporation” in this dystopia?

Cake, pizza, ruler, whatever. I was referring to that type of comparison in general. Yes that’s right, you can add decimal points forever to a normal number. But bitcoin currently has a limit. If they change that later then ok but right now there is a limited amount of decimal places. Right?

All he was asking was if they can continue to add decimals. The current answer is no, there’s a limit. Cake, on the other hand, can be cut into infinitesimally small pieces, adding decimal points forever. If they change that rule later then ok, then we’ll have a new limit

Are you serious? You wouldn’t happen to have a volleyball best friend named Wilson would you?

Doesn’t matter unless you sell �� just wait until it’s accepted at the grocery store or for college tuition and then no capital gains tax right? I can only hope...

I was in Cape Town with friends a few weeks ago. Many people we met there say it’s the Silicon Valley of Africa. Wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of cryptos flow through there.

I threw $1k to bitcoin a few hours ago. Wrong sub, but I’m buying the litecoin dip instead
