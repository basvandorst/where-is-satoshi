You're talking about a single account, yes. He's talking about there being a mechanism in place if a sudden, massive amount of btc were being requested to leave the system over all the accounts as a whole, to limit the amount of damage even if all the wallets or accounts are breached.
100k bitcoin should never, never, NEVER be allowed to leave the system in one go without a human review and approval. That is obviously highly irregular and they should have had a system in place to flag and prevent that type of activity. That's just common sense at this point, to even people with no security expertise.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:09:02
What was their actual purpose, if not to have measures in place to prevent massive, irregular amounts of BTC leaving the system at once or in a small timeframe? Why would they automatically sign such a large transfer? If all they do is automatically sign *whatever*, then that's pretty much the same as them not existing at all, no?
How was an output limit *higher than* **119 thousand** bitcoin? If I had a $100,000,000 ATM limit on my debit card, that's functionally the same as not having a *limit* at all...
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:27:39
Yeah... if their "design" included a short timespan output "limit" of higher than 119k BTC, or say, 21 million BTC... then that could be considered a *true* statement, even though it's complete bullshit because that's effectively **no limit at all**. So all you're left with is pointless code, and an *appearance* of security.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:32:11
You're quasi-right. Libs, anarchocaps aren't anti-rules and enforcement of societal standards like say, getting the stolen funds back... or public safety, defending against aggressors/attackers etc. The problem is, current states claim a *monopoly* of force to the exclusion of alternative methods and agencies. They directly prevent the market of investigators and justice seekers that could bring a thief such as this to justice.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:58:58
Yep, maybe even worse because a false sense of security.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:53:21
I'm not advocating anything. I'm just saying if it was less risky for him to give back the majority of coins by not being retaliated against, then a certain percentage of thefts will have that outcome, and the victims will be better off.
And I never even suggested that there would be no punishment or other negative aspects for the hacker in the agreement made for the release of the funds. You really should listen to what people say not jump to all sorts of conclusions about what they *might have meant*.
When did I say it's the government's fault? You're just teeming with assumptions, aren't you?
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:20:17


Good rundown. And you came to the same conclusion I did--their single use case was security *theater*.
If all BitGo did was exactly what BFC told them to do... well, BFC can do exactly what they tell themselves to do.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:03:38
Yeah, and it's impossible to predict what would actually happen in a truly free market. But maybe it would be like the roads in some people's ideas of what it *could* be like. The big companies whose trucks use them the most and do the most damage in wear and tear would pay for them and for their upkeep, and everyone else would get to free-ride as long as they didn't do stupid, reckless shit.
There could be law enforcement that serves the general public without any direct cost for services, like an insurance plan you get for "free" just by being employed or due to having residence in a certain area.
If you're thinking cynically and have the idea that *if someone can't afford to pay for justice then they get none*... well, no one I know wants to see it work out like that, so all I can say is I really doubt it would. And if it did initially, then that's what charity is for. People are generally very charitable even with being taxed 15-60%. So if they're not taxed at all, they could afford to be more charitable.
I hope that gives you a sliver of possibility to imagine.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:57:51
Please, please don't tell us it's as idiotic as *individual limits per account* because that's obviously almost entirely useless. Even if they could only steal 10 btc per person, that would steal be a fuckton of a total were they to have access to all wallets.
Edit: Obviously they should have had max output limits over the entirety of the accounts, maybe even on a minute-to-minute basis with a flagging mechanism in place to alert an actual human if the cap-per-minute is hit enough consecutively so that someone can check on what's actually happening. Letting 100k btc go in one flood is mindbogglingly ridiculous. Layers of security. Even if all wallets are compromised they should only be able to sweep so much.

@_date: 2016-08-03 13:21:12
No, if the market were to exist I'm sure they would, to me and you, seem much like the agencies we're familiar with. Though probably much better, as their incentives would be in line with their customers not distorted by politics and lobbyists and layer upon layer of contracts.
It's like a race with only women who practice ancient Chinese footbinding. It's hard how to imagine how it would actually look, even though the women who had normal, healthy feet would almost certainly perform much better.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:23:45


I'm not going to comment on whether or not they should be liable. But they should have their own standards of practice *that they don't compromise, regardless of what the customers say they want*.
If I own the best, highest quality restaurant in town, *I'm not making you a hotdog*. I don't care how much your kid wants one for his birthday dinner. I have my own standards, and have possibly made claims about only using top quality ingredients. I'm not selling out my honor, my word, and my reputation even if you throw $500 at me to shut your kid up.
If they claim(ed) a duty to have specific security measures like output limits (which would have prevented so much btc leaving the system) then they should not compromise on those security features, otherwise they are just a sham, "security in name only" as someone said above.
It's possible that an argument could be made that they defrauded wallet owners by stating levels and methods of security that they weren't actually providing, assuaging the minds of bitcoiners who know too well how important security is in this space.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:42:48










Yes and that's the unfortunate part of the "legal" system. That type of String-him-up policy negatively incentivizes someone to do the right thing, perhaps, after reading about people losing life savings etc. and feeling bad about it. 
It's the same principle applied to say, someone who kidnaps someone. They did it impulsively but now they can't risk letting the person live because the consequences for the kidnapping and/or rape is life in prison, same as for murder in many places. So, unfortunately, they're better off not having any "lose ends". Letting the victim go is much riskier than killing them, with the only real upside on the former being less of a hit to his/her conscience (which... the perpetrator might not have anyways).
Theoretically, if all people involved made a deal with the hacker that if he/she gave back the majority of coins with a promise that he/she would not be hunted down *and that promise would be absolutely kept* then it could end better for the victims (and everyone, actually)... but we all know that's not going to happen in the current statist environment.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:41:42
That's not really a good answer either. If their "limit" for automatically signing transactions in one go is higher than 119k bitcoin, then what's the point of a limit at all? What was the actual limit, if it's higher than 119k? 500k? 1m? 20m?
That's not security. That's just doing whatever Bitfinex tells them to do, which is effectively the same as BitGo not existing at all.

@_date: 2014-04-16 12:30:07
Because plenty of others who have funds in Gox find it morally reprehensible that their funds could be used in a start-up capacity by people who have no right or claim to use their money. 
It's not like Gox is just OFF, and all that needs to happen is someone just needs to turn it back on. Gox was a patchwork of shit code piled on top of even shittier code from the early days when bitcoin was worth almost nothing and the thought of a super secure platform in which billions in value would be traded was never even a consideration.
If someone buys Gox they will have to start from scratch with everything but the name and accounting records. That will take lots of time and money. And no one has a right to use customer funds to structure that business. I'd love to have $100m to start a business too, but I don't get to use other people's money to do it. 
At the very least, everyone who has coins/cash in Gox should have the option to get their share, approximately 20%, and leave. Anyone who is left and wants to let any new owners of Gox to use their money could do so.

All good points. I don't think it's a huge deal, but the last thing we need right now is to be scaring already skittish investors.
If bitcoin ever has a chance to go mainstream it needs to be pretty damn solid.
@_date: 2014-01-01 06:52:04
Yeah, fairly so. You can get brass scraps for little cost. All you need are the stamps. You could even use pennies, as copper has a pretty high melting point as well. Most of the small, cheap fire-safes are only rated for 1200 F, or less. House fires are often higher than that. So a high melt temp metal stamping is the way to go, imo. Plus it's much more concealable than even the smallest fire safe.
@_date: 2014-01-26 11:42:27
No doubt. But things, they are a changin'.
The public consciousness about things like drugs/drug wars and discrimination against sexual orientation and race etc. is expanding and improving every day. We can only hope that financial crises will not go ignored as well. Impending hyperinflation or instability of the dollar just may help accomplish that. Because right now, I'm not sure that most people are even aware that there is a problem.

Of course not, but I'm speaking in terms of **Paypal's** stance.
Bitcoin is alien to them. They don't know whose address is what, especially when there are not always identities tied to addresses. Some are, but plenty are not.
Paypal could solve that issue, if and when they ever began accepting bitcoin, by having their own internal, verifiable wallets, but until then they can't prove a damn thing.
As it is now, if I sell you 10 bitcoin and send those bitcoin, you could then file a dispute saying you never received them. I could show Paypal I sent bitcoin to so-and-so address but that address you told me to send to you, you could have created with absolutely no identification tied to it, so who does Paypal believe?

What's the big deal?
If I want to buy lunch, I'm going to be spending. 
If I need new clothes, or shampoo, or gas for my car I'm going to be spending.
If I want to go out for a movie or to a club or travel to Europe, I'm going to be spending (ooh and how nice *that* will be never having to worry about international credit cards or currency exchanges).

I don't disagree that the name could be useful, but the rebirth should be funded not by the victims against their will. If some people are down with that plan, great, go for it but the option to not be a part of it needs to be there.
Keeping your money in Gox after the opportunity to exit could be akin to being a part of an IPO--they could even issue stock, or an alt or colored coin to those who do leave funds in Gox for new owners to use to jumpstart Gox 2.0. It *could* work, but it would be a hell of an uphill climb.

1) It doesn't matter who Satoshi is. Even if Satoshi is the NSA, the ghost of Hitler, or the most currently evil person walking the planet... Bitcoin is open source, so we can all see what exactly it is and how it works.
2) If anyone achieved 50% of the network they would be able to double spend, at most, a few blocks before it would be realized. Then measures would be taken. Would it crash the market? Probably, due to the perception of the loss of trust of the network. But it wouldn't be the doomsday scenario many make it out to be.
3) As the volatility is lessened as the market cap of bitcoin grows, the speculatory factor is lessened and those who were less risk averse yesterday, will come into the market tomorrow.
Earlier adopters had more risk and more volatility. Later adopters will have less volatility, less value appreciation, but less risk.
This is true of any market, and especially true of a completely new technology.

You're a moron to create such a ridiculous straw man. Who *would* go to the trouble to buy bitcoin for a single purchase just so they could then immediately spend it all, after going to all the trouble buying it at an exchange?

You are applying your personal, regional situation to everyone on the planet which is just fucking ignorant.
bitcoin is actually much better and even less volatile than a good number of government currencies and a better store of value.
Just because you don't NEED bitcoin (yet) doesn't mean some people in other parts of the world do. If you're in the U.S. or somewhere similar you have it pretty good, so you'll probably be one of the last people to "need" bitcoin.

Hash SHA-256 in a non bitcoin related fashion. What you would do with that, who knows. Any SHA-256 is pretty obviously going to be a bitcoin miner... but the point is, selling computers isn't against ebay's policy, so to discriminate against anything that can or will be used to mine bitcoin potentially/probably violates anti-trust law.
And you can use delivery confirmation with a physical miner, so there's no legit reason as to why ebay would prevent these listings or freeze the accounts of anyone selling them in a proper manner (i.e. not scamming people).

Thanks for writing Gavin. I've seen even people in the bitcoin community [imply that you confirmed Satoshi's identity]( with your twitter post. I saw it as nothing more than you calling her out for bringing heat on and unwanted attention to *whoever* that may be and his family members.
She should really be ashamed of herself, yet journalists who did even less research than her are patting her on the back for it. [Brilliant Journalism?]( 
I think what she did is little more than chase the legendary name, narrow it down to a few suspects, and then go after the one that seemed to fit the best. Other than his statements (which could have been confused with the topic of his job, or whatever else he may have thought she was bothering him about) there is ZERO EVIDENCE.
I hope you don't feel bad, or responsible for talking to her. Joe Rogan was right when he said the whole mysterious Satoshi story is really sexy... but certainly no one could have seen this coming. After Erik Voorhees' recent experience, we all got an eye-opening on how these people operate.

You could make that exact same argument regarding whether or not governments you don't control may launch all of their nukes tomorrow. Do you consider whether or not you're going to buy a car or a house, because *maybe Country X will nuke us next week*?
Of course not, you're powerless either way.
You're also ignoring the fact that if a pool did double-spend, people would know it almost immediately. And they wouldn't get away with it forever. It's not a doomsday scenario or an end road, even if it did happen.

"Off eBay presale requirements
If you sell items in an online store (not eBay), you must guarantee delivery within 20 days from the date of purchase and make sure that the customer knows they are buying a presale item."
Dude, it says it right there. 20 day policy for off ebay. 30 day policy for ebay.
The policy can be amended on an individual basis if the seller can prove that the pre-ordered items are actually being produced and are expected to be ready for delivery in a reasonable amount of time.
This was the policy that BFL violated by not doing all of that, and by not delivering in 30 days, but over **300** days, in some cases.

There are lots of creative innovators. Satoshi hasn't been involved since 2010. Other people not including Hal and Satoshi have been developing bitcoin since then, and then there are all the creative people making bitcoin-based services and products.

No one "lost money" unless they sold for more than they bought for (if they sold at all). Losses are not realized until a sell.
A bitcoin last week is still the same bitcoin this week, which is still the same bitcoin that was worth a mere $100 just months ago.

Look, you clearly do not understand fraud or the law, as much as you seem to think you do.
The hypothetical goods we are discussing are not "stolen". They were shipped willingly by the vendor. If the vendor failed to detect the fraudulent card, then it is on them to replace the stolen funds. The FUNDS were stolen, not the product. Again, Bob had nothing to do with the actual stolen cards, so he is innocent in every way possible.
You witch-hunting and trying to find blame (while ignoring the real thief?) does not solve any problems and creating another victim by stealing from Bob who legitimately paid for his goods only makes it worse by eradicating the fungibility of money.

That said, people have been warning about Gox for well over a year. One of the first things I remember learning about bitcoin early last year is "stay the fuck away from Gox", and I never used them.
I also heeded the advice about using cold storage. 
As much as people warned against using Gox, and about being your own bank, holding onto your own coins, not keeping them online, it's hard to feel a huge amount of sorrow for people who directly enabled Gox to do what they did. 
It sucks people have lost coins/money but goddammit, we saw this coming a long time ago and we weren't exactly quiet about it.

Totally agree. 
From another thread: Because plenty of others who have funds in Gox find it morally reprehensible that their funds could be used in a start-up capacity by people who have no right or claim to use their money.
It's not like Gox is just OFF, and all that needs to happen is someone just needs to turn it back on. Gox was a patchwork of shit code piled on top of even shittier code from the early days when bitcoin was worth almost nothing and the thought of a super secure platform in which billions in value would be traded was never even a consideration.
If someone buys Gox they will have to start from scratch with everything but the name and accounting records. That will take lots of time and money. And no one has a right to use customer funds to structure that business. I'd love to have $100m to start a business too, but I don't get to use other people's money to do it.
At the very least, everyone who has coins/cash in Gox should have the option to get their share, approximately 20%, and leave. Anyone who is left and wants to let any new owners of Gox to use their money could do so.

No, it's not. Pyramid schemes have *heads* who funnel money to themselves. Satoshi unleashed this technology upon us and said: Go. Do what you want. His coins have never moved, even once. He may have discarded the private keys due to some weird ethical standard. We may never know. The bottoms of actual pyramid schemes never break even, let alone return any sort of profit.
But bitcoin is definitely not a pyramid scheme which fundamentally enriches the top, while pilfering from the bottom. A pyramid scheme is a zero-sum game, while bitcoin is not. 
It's always more profitable to get in early on something that is successful, but that is far from the definition of a Pyramid Scheme.

That's such a shortsighted view. You criticize bitcoin for it being held in the hands of a few (which is hardly true) and at the same time criticize the thought of Satoshi selling some of his which would spread them out among the masses.
Whatever Satoshi does--if he even still has access to those addresses--is certainly fine with me. He earned them with his brilliant creation. Would it tank the price for a bit? Yep--it certainly would. But it would also certainly not *kill* bitcoin or harm the protocol. Huge drops of well over 90% didn't kill bitcoin in the past and nether would that.
And that's all besides the point that Satoshi is a pretty smart person/s. It's common knowledge what selling thousands of coins would do to the price, so selling his stash would massively drop the price he'd be selling into. He wouldn't make anywhere near the half billion dollars his coins are currently valued at market rate.
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:26:18

Because they learned something (that we don't know yet) that made them react in a very specific way, very quickly. And that was to separate themselves from Gox, and make the statement that the problem is not with bitcoin itself.
There are A LOT of people who almost certainly would have stepped in to help temporarily if it was merely a problem with frozen funds due to government intervention in relation to Silk Road investigation. Those coins would not be taken from customers of Gox even if Gox was under investigation. Worst case scenario, they would be released after court hearings or trial which might take even a year or two. The bitcoin community could easily float Gox the liquidity until the end of that time period. As we saw Gox was operating still with only a small number of coins in the hot wallet. Only a small percentage of the total is needed to do so.
There are at least a few people who definitely know more than we do. I recommend listening to the recent letstalkbitcoin podcast with Charlie Shrem.
For the sake of those with funds at Gox, I really, really hope that a government has seized Karpeles' bank assets because that means eventually people will be made whole, but that's certainly not how it seems so far.

Anyone who hasn't--that's on them. I hope people don't lose their money, butstop telling me Gox affects me. It doesn't. My head is not in the sand. I'm well aware of the issue. I follow the news throughout the day, every day.
Gox is not bitcoin. If (when) Gox fails completely it does not affect the blockchain--it does not affect bitcoin--it does not affect me.
I don't have a shoulder for anyone to cry on who has value stored in Gox anymore than I have a shoulder for someone who blows their savings in Vegas. *Great for trading* they said. *Lots of volatility--more spread than any other exchange* they told me. Yep. And now you reap what you sow because you ignored the warning signs.

Assuming I even believe your story, did it ever occur to you that those people might not have died if those drugs were legal and they could have professional guardians help those people with their experiments so that they wouldn't get hurt?
Most people who die using drugs die because they are not regulated so who knows what the purity and quality of those drugs are? Drugs like heroin have a high LD 50, so it's easy to overdose especially if they don't know how strong each dose they get will be.
I work at a hospital. Do you know what the majority of drug related injuries are due to? Alcohol. From bar fight injuries, to falls, to overdosing and medication interaction and suicide attempts. But even then I'm not vilifying alcohol. Plenty of people use alcohol responsibly in their homes, or somewhere safe and without driving around risking the safety of others.
It would be wrong to demonize alcohol or any other drug just because a small percentage misuse them and are harmed--especially when it was *their choice* to do so.

It's a dumb, weak criticism because businesses who accept dollars **do not hold/horde the dollars they receive for goods and services, either**. If anyone tried to make the same suggestion that businesses do so with their dollars, they would be looked at like they are crazy.
Businesses have lots of expenses, employees to pay and some only have a few percent profit margin. Keeping the money they receive from customers--whether dollars, bitcoin, or otherwise--is simply not an option.

Yeah, I see what you're saying, but to be 100% clear, in that case those bitcoins aren't exactly bitcoin in the pure definition I am using. They are placeholders for bitcoin in their centralized internal network. Coinbase is similar environment. Gox could be operating a fractional ponzi scheme inside that network for all we know.
In the true sense of the term bitcoin I was using, it's impossible to do that with ACTUAL bitcoin. Goxbits or Goxbux or Coinbasebits? Absolutely.

I didn't say the realism of returns is in your head. I said the problem is in your head.
You aren't understanding that if I must pay you in USD then I am exchanging bitcoin for USD to pay you USD. **That pegs my bitcoin to USD at that exact rate**. If I need a return for my purchase and receive USD back, and the value of bitcoin doubled in that time, then I lost out on that appreciation while that money was in USD.
The same exact thing happens if you accept bitcoin for items priced in USD, pegged to USD with returns in bitcoin with the caveat that the pegged price is the amount to be returned, if a return does occur.
So, *my funds are being pegged to USD* EITHER WAY, but if you accept bitcoin directly then at least that saves me from having to use an exchange to trade BTC for USD so that I can buy from you.
And you are benefiting from the business. It is truly win-win.

Miners are not "bitcoin products", they're just computers. Any computer, including your cell phone can hash SHA-256.
Paypal banned sales of bitcoin because people were committing fraud and for "virtual items" there's no way to prove delivery of those goods, so that put Paypal in an obviously bad situation.
But that's not true regarding physical products like computers that can mine bitcoin. Delivery confirmation, signature confirmation, and you're good to go.

That stood out to me the most too. 
Maybe it's as simple as Gox was low on funds, Mark thought he would roll the dice and take a chance he was selling near the height of a current bubble--versus having to close shop for certain if he did not do something to fix an incredible problem--and then the price actually exploded beyond any possibility that they could ever be bought back, in order to replace them.
And then ever since he has been running on a very small hot wallet, trying to stay afloat and trying to manipulate the market as much as possible so that he can make coins back, e.g. frontrunning buys, blaming the protocol for malleability and literally anything he can do to "trade" his way back to at least not appear to be insolvent with hopes that over the years he can continue that process until the funds are mostly or completely replaced.
If Mark felt Gox was *his baby* and felt bitcoin literally depended on Gox to not fall then it wouldn't be completely implausible that he would resort to such a drastic measure--all the while thinking he is doing the best possible actions for Gox, for himself, for bitcoin, and for everyone in the bitcoin community... as fucked up as that sounds.
But of course, we can still see a number of huge caches of coins that Gox for sure once controlled, as many have said before, so unless he literally sold someone not just the coins but the actual wallet (also unlikely because of trust/counterparty risk) which they never moved, it just doesn't add up.
P.S.   Good write-up Rick.
@_date: 2014-04-29 07:13:33
Exactly right. I'm highly suspicious of these people's motive. They are the ones who planned to make a "token offering" of ONE BITCOIN for Gox. These people are not creditors merely trying to get their coins back. Do they merely want access to the 200k bitcoins? 
If they only wanted to own/operate an exchange they could just start their own. The foundation of Gox's trading platform is rubbish so that would obviously need to be rebuilt from the ground up. Gox's reputation is trashed and the company is heavily in debt, so why get into the exchange business with all of those marks against it? The only logical answer is that they want to get access to that nearly $100m worth of coins.
Even if they do not have ill intent regarding those coins, at the very least it would seem that they want to use that money, or some portion of it, to bootstrap the resurrection of Gox. I find that to be an ethically bankrupt position to take, as it should be each and every creditor's choice whether or not to remove or keep their coins in Gox to be used for such a venture. 
What have these people done to earn the trust of the actual owners of those 200k coins? And why do they deserve to be the new owners when they have done nothing for the community? 
If actual creditors want to reboot Gox, great, but allow those who do not want to be a part of it to move their coins out immediately, as that should be their right (assuming a reconstruction is even possible). Why not allow a board comprised of creditors to try to reboot Gox, rather than this possibly shady group who wants 51% of the company and access to 200k coins *for one single bitcoin*? 
Let the creditors decide who is to run Gox 2.0. If the creditors decide to let this group do so, then so be it. But as it is now, they seem to be forcing their way into that position. As a goxcoin owner, what do you think about that?

While there are many interesting questions here, I seriously doubt Andreas had much at all to do with operating functions in Neo. That may not be the case, but I saw no indicators that led me to believe that he was in control of anything. 
If you're an employee of a company and the boss does some crazy shit, are you in any way to blame?
If people used the fact that he was merely involved in the project as a buy signal then that's kind of on them. Andreas is not a virtual King Midas. Him being an "advisor" does not mean that he has any control over what anyone else in the company does. So it's not very cool to put any amount of the failure on his shoulders, imo.
It would be interesting if he did explain his position though.

Fuuuuuck that. I never want to see Magic The Gathering Online eXchange in operation ever again.
Why would you want to own Gox? Its foundation and code is absolute shit. You would need to completely rebuild the platform from the ground up, so all you would be buying is a name and a whole lot of debt. If you want to own and operate a bitcoin exchange, just build a new one. Few will ever trust Gox again.
Buying Gox solely for the name has me highly suspect of your true motivation. Do you really want to rebuild the exchange or do you merely want to get your hands on those 220k coins?

makes a very good point.
I agree with you in general OP, but I think they took the lazy way out because to them it's something so incredibly small--and they probably even hold the viewpoint that it is a fad or a bubble or whatever, and won't last.
If bitcoin is still around in 5 years and has come close tor to mass adoption, then I would expect they will treat it differently. Government institutions can be incredibly slow. 
I don't expect the IRS will "go after" people using bitcoin as a currency, especially not for small every day items. Buy a bit-ticket item? Then yeah, report that.
Otherwise, it's just very unrealistic to expect people to keep track of every little thing they buy and the rate at the time they spent bitcoin, compared to the rate at which they purchased it. Imagine having to do that every time you spent fiat. Fiat value does go up and down--people just don't normally see it when they use a single fiat as the basis for comparison.
TL;DR  I wouldn't worry about it.

I don't know... I certainly sympathize with your feelings that bitcoin is being held back by all of the constant FUD and probable manipulation coming out of China, but what is being held back really, besides the price?
I'd love to see the price rise as much as the next bitcoiner, but aside from the price, is bitcoin being held back by China even in the slightest? I don't think so. In fact, I think a very important experiment is playing out right before our eyes--and one that perhaps other governments will look at in the future when they examine how--and if--they can regulate bitcoin at all.
I don't believe China regulators will win this battle in the end, and the outcome will be an interesting one exampling how adaptable bitcoin and smart people in this space can be.
Let's not focus on the price so much, because it's not the be-all-end-all, and a price drop is usually a very short-term trend anyways. Think long.
**To those newcomers who feel shaken as they bought in @ &gt; $600, all I can say is *this is how it is*, but in time you will get used to the volatility and it won't continue to be a scary experience.

Not true, money is made to SPEND. And people will always save up to buy things, just as they do now. They'll just see a bit more value to it. But once the volatility subsides, the deflation rate would only be slight. And why does the deflation happen? Because human population is increasing. But that won't always be the case. Eventually there will be equilibrium with that too, just as it will be with the bitcoin price if mass adoption ever happens.

In a completely free market economy, yes. But we do not have that, because the ability to operate a bank is very limited, and the barrier to entry very high due to "regulation". So we have the market dominated by most banks owned by large conglomerates and it's very easy for all of them to ban you if they want. Now you can't use any banking services, and I'm fairly certain most will agree that having a bank account is a must for most working people.
If something is a must for most people, one could argue that such a service is a utility, and people have a right to utilities.

It's hardly an anonymous service. Hopefully they could track down the thief, **but that has nothing to do with Bob**.
I'm not advocating for credit card thieves and frauds here. This is nothing close to *actual stolen goods* purchased for a fraction of the actual value via some shady seller that many seem to be trying to compare this scenario to. With that scenario, the buyer can use common sense to consider: "Gee, why is this iPad only $50?" And again, this iPad IS actually stolen... Bob's electronics are technically not.
They were purchased at or around market rate and Bob had nothing to do with the stolen cards. The merchant accepted the stolen funds, so it is them who must account for the funds after their lax security failed. Bob could not scrutinize the credit card/s even if he wanted to.
It might be a haven for fraudsters if they don't incorporate security measures, yes, and if so, then their business will suffer for it. Only time will tell. I think it's a shabby assumption that they will not have anti-fraud measures as some in this thread are suggesting, though I have no knowledge of their inner-workings. Cheers.

His next fight is June 7, so that's doable. He might not have sponsors fully lined-up yet.
Here's some info on him for anyone interested: 
@_date: 2014-05-23 07:15:41
If you say by 7, then anytime before 7 is fine. If you say by/before the first half of 7:00-8:00(in other words, 7:30) then anytime before 7:30 is fine.
If you say by [the end of] the first half of 2014, then anytime before the end of the first half (anytime before the end of June--6 of 12 months) is applicable.
In your example you're completely ignoring that he said *the first half* which is leaving out a whole lot of context. Clearly he meant *by mid year* even if he didn't say it exactly correctly.

It's not a change to existing customers. It simply opens the door to additional revenue who can't or wouldn't want to do a monthly.
No idea, really? How bout a couple billion people on the planet who might not be able to afford $8 a month, but who might want to watch a few+ movies a month at $.25 to $.50 each. They save money and Netflix makes money.
What overhead would be increased? With bitcoin, they wouldn't even need to worry about dealing with Paypal or credit card companies in which Paypal etc. doesn't even offer services in those countries.
Literally anyone in the world with an internet connection and some bitcoin could be a customer.

Guess what, every time you use your credit card you give everything need to charge those credit cards, over to the merchant. Most merchants don't, but THEY COULD use that information to charge your card again without your permission.

Bobs items were never "taken by fraud". Again, they were sent willingly by the vendor. 
Go after the **actual thieves**. Bob had nothing to do with the actual stolen items.
You're completely applying the wrong standard. If Bob bought the devices from someone who actually stole them from someone, that would be one thing. That's not what happened here. It's one hop down the line, and Bob had nothing to do with the thief or the actual stolen goods, the credit cards.

That *is* what we need but those aren't really regulations. That's just true free-market force. The customers will choose the services that best serve them, and that will likely include insured *bank-ish* institutions which the masses will feel safe using (if they touch bitcoin directly, at all).

That would destroy the fungibility of the money. 
Imagine you get your month's pay and the next day men with guns (the authority I believe you are referring to) arrive at your home and tell you that that money was stolen a few hops up the chain and that they're going to have to go ahead and give your paycheck back to the rightful owner.
If that were even a possibility, people would never want to actually have that money due to the risk involved in holding it in that one day it may be discovered it was previously "stolen" and it is then taken away.
That poor form of money would be replaced by a better form of money.

Average the rate. Take the average price from the moment the agreement was made to when the payment is actually made. It's not perfect but it would hedge (for both parties) against huge movement in price.
Example: 
Agreement is made for $1000 when bitcoin is valued at $500. 
Bitcoin drops to $400 at the time payment is made. 
Adjusted bitcoin rate is $450. Bitcoin due - 2.22222222
If that's too complicated, just set the price to USD as suggested. This agreement is legally binding and already set to USD price so it really shouldn't be an issue.
Just make your policy clear, and suggest to your customers that they set aside (or purchase those bitcoin, if they need to) right away so that they don't *feel* they got ambushed by any major price move.

The question only applies to people who have bitcoin. Why would you ask the general public? Of course no one is going to use bitcoin to pay for things if they don't have any to use.

Peter's right, of course, and it obviously *could* happen. (It's disconcerting how little Max knows about bitcoin, btw) But even it does happen, then we will just switch to an asic-resistant/asic-proof coin. Bitcoin may die, but cryptocurrency will not. Even if government(s) win a battle in destroying bitcoin, they will never be able to nuke all of the cryptos short of shutting down the internet permanently.

The same thing was said about the internet. Were you around, or do you remember when you had to configure routers and IPs all that mess? A lot of people weren't able or willing to do all that at the time, so until more user-friendly devices were invented (Plug N Play, etc.), the users were limited. 
We're right back there now with bitcoin. If you want to spend some time tinkering and hassling a little bit, you can make it work, and it works pretty damn well, given that.
But yes, there is a long way to go before a typical person can use it with zero knowledge or skills.

No I'm saying that saying "fix the protocol" is a pretty ignorant statement when the protocol is working as intended. The majority of miners always had to be trusted or there would be trouble. It's all in the original whitepaper.
There are no sure things. 
Large pools might be the best thing the market can offer. Imagine if there were no pools and a zero-day virus bot-netted thousands of computers to do a 51% attack. Then there would be no pool heads to stop it nearly instantly. Pool managers are much better in that scenario. In fact even one large super trustworthy pool is one of the best ways to protect against a 51% attack because then it's practically impossible for any other group to get more than them when there are 10+ pools like there are now.
You need to stop freaking out as if a 51% attack is a doomsday scenario. It's not. Read what Andreas Antonopoulos has said on the topic.

Regardless of what you think, it's largely out of your hands now. The genie is out of the bottle. Governments won't control money forever. Their grasp is slipping, and soon "money laundering" will be a thing of the past because it will be too expensive, implausible, or impossible to prove.
Money is not a crime. Prosecute the actual crime and be done with it. Money laundering is a post-"crime" as Matonis and others have explained. It is merely something done after the fact. It's like making *eating a stolen candy bar* a crime along with the stealing of the candy bar. Stealing is the crime. Eating the fucking thing is not only a given... but a double-dip on the prosecution of the actual crime.

It is a currency, it's just a volatile one **right now**, and the point is to protect against getting hurt by the fluctuations. Your customers--especially bitcoiners--are not as dumb as you may think.
We know that you should not have to bear the burden of the risk of volatility and the possible bad actors that may try to abuse the system if you pegged the price to bitcoin and gave 100% returns in bitcoin at the bitcoin value purchase price.
I would not be pissed. I would look at it like this. If I want your item, and you didn't take BTC, then I would have to convert to USD (which is pegging the price to USD right there) anyways. 
So all that is happening is, you're taking my bitcoin because I want to pay with bitcoin and I like that you are supporting the bitcoin infrastructure, which is an absolute necessity for this whole thing to succeed in the long run.
I know about and welcome the fact that if the price goes up and I want a return, then I will be receiving less BTC than I paid. But I knew that ahead of time, so it's ok, because it was my choice to make and I made it.

Oh the "bitcoin is wasteful" argument. How much resources/money is saved because we don't need men with armored cars and guns to handle the large cash movement? How much is saved by not having all the regulation and regulators and bankers making big bucks on the backs of the masses?
Bitcoin is hugely more efficient than legacy monetary systems.
Merely printing and minting money is a significant percentage of the value of currency and that, of course, is just the beginning.
Why don't you actually calculate the direct and indirect costs of the legacy money system and compare it to the cost of the bitcoin network instead of just spouting trolly bullshit?

I like the design a lot and can definitely see potential. I would absolutely buy one if they were available in the next 12 months.
But down the road in the next 5-10 years, wearables are going to be the way to go. Few people want to carry around multiple devices. Until wearables integrate phones completely, you might see the best benefit in offering a cold wallet that integrates with cell phones (with an air gap) so that cell phone-using bitcoiners don't have to lug around an additional device.

Nono, if you buy bitcoin you don't want to move to bitstamp. If you're wanting bitcoin for a storage of value, you want to hold onto those YOURSELF, not put them anywhere online. So you want them in cold storage where it is impossible for any wallet or any site which has your bitcoin to be hacked or stolen.
And are you sure the btcturk site is legit/dependable?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:42:21
Because of the Network Effect. The network is actually the most important aspect of bitcoin, aside from the initial invention. 
The computing power in the bitcoin network is simply massive. It would be very difficult to reproduce. 
That article was from almost a year ago. Now, of course, the network is even larger. 
Sure, Google could make GoogleCoin, but would it have a vast network that resists a majority attack? Would it even be decentralized, or would Google simply run it and do as it wishes? Doing the latter would remove one of the greatest, strongest aspects of bitcoin--decentralization.

@_date: 2014-04-17 06:46:45
It matters because imagine buying something on the fly that anyone else paying with any other method would be on their way in seconds (which you're well used to doing).
Now you're basically forced into a penalty box, waiting for 10 minutes for your "confirmation", knowing full well that it's almost completely unnecessary. This will make you despise the merchant and not want to buy their goods or services, and if most merchants use a One Confirmation Standard, it will make you not want to use bitcoin for Brick&amp;Mortar purchases at all. This is bad for those businesses and this is bad for bitcoin.
If you're a B&amp;M business, get a small camera so if someone does defraud or thieve from you, then there are possible repercussions for those acts. This is truly a non-issue, and will only be an actual issue if businesses buy into the hype that they "need confirmations" and their customers suffer as a result. I bought a $2k Amazon gift card via Gyft during the last Black Friday event. They didn't make me wait for even a single confirmation. I was mailed the redemption code instantly and applied it to my Amazon account seconds later. If Gyft doesn't wait for a confirmation for such a purchase, then it's certainly not necessary for a $10 taco.
*The above scenario is under IDEAL conditions assuming the 1 confirmation goes through on the first block, flawlessly. There are cases in which this does not happen, and sometimes the first confirmation can take tens of minutes, sometimes hours... but they almost always do go through eventually. Imagine buying lunch and that happens.
Businesses, please educate yourselves about this technical issue and after doing so, I believe that you will see how much of a nonissue this is. Requiring confirmations will not be good for anyone, and there are other methods that can help prevent fraud.

The trouble of manufacturing this ruse. 
Besides, the malleability "hack"/coverup was certainly not when the coins were lost/stolen. The loss most likely occurred in 2011 so for the thieves to do this now just doesn't make any sense.

Are you really telling me you think that this service will or will not succeed based on the fact that the name has **Dark** in it?
First impression has nothing to do with the name. It has to do with everything else--the music, the product, the service the thing the consumer is actually interested in. The name is just the call sign to distinguish from all others. It's pretty much meaningless at the beginning.

Here's some ammunition for your meeting.
[Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme?](
Given that the market of freely choosing individuals has placed a value on Bitcoin, the burden of proof is on North to show that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.  However, the Ponzi scheme Wikipedia entry shows that the very definition of a Ponzi scheme does not apply to Bitcoin.
There are several key differences between a Ponzi scheme and Bitcoin.  First, Ponzi scheme vehicles are inherently fraudulent.  When running a Ponzi scheme, the promoters lie to participants and conceal key information about the where their funds go.  Bernie Madoff, who claimed his firm’s consistently high returns were based on investments which he in fact never made, is a prime example.  The issuance by Allen Stanford of phony certificates of deposit to unwitting customers is another example.  In contrast, Bitcoin is not based on fraud or deception.  Bitcoin is an open book, literally.  The open source model Bitcoin employs means that it cannot claim to be one thing while in fact being another.  Anyone is free to inspect the Bitcoin code base to determine for himself what it is or is not.  This difference alone starkly distinguishes Bitcoin from a Ponzi scheme.
The second key difference between Bitcoin and a Ponzi scheme is revealed in Wikipedia’s differentiation of a Ponzi scheme from a pyramid scheme.  A Ponzi scheme requires an operator.  “In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a ‘hub’ for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.”  Bitcoin is not run by anyone.  It is a decentralized system – in Hayekian terms, a spontaneous order.  Anyone can mine, buy, or sell bitcoins.  And unlike Charles Ponzi, Bitcoin has no promoter acting as a hub. The creator(s) of Bitcoin are anonymous.  (Note: Bitcoin is capitalized when referring to the software and network as a whole, and uncapitalized when referring to individual currency units.)
The third difference is this: “A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach and often attracts well-to-do investors….”  Bitcoin is the opposite of esoteric.  It is open source, and all are free to use it at their own chosen level of participation.  Computer programmers can read and even modify the source code.  Crytographers can study, and even try to crack, the mathematics of the system.  And everyone, techie and non-techie alike, can buy and sell BTC (the abbreviation for bitcoins) without understanding Bitcoin’s inner workings.
There is a single trait that Bitcoin can be said to have in common with highly successful Ponzi schemes:  a dramatic appreciation in price.  But if that trait is all that’s required to make something a Ponzi scheme, then countless stocks which have soared from a penny per share at corporate founding to hundreds of dollars per share would be considered Ponzi schemes.

You consider early adopters people who bought in at &gt; $400? 
The truth is, most bought at order/s of magnitude lower than $400 but if you're new to bitcoin and bought in at $600+ I can certainly see why you would come to that conclusion. 
If you're an early adopter who bought in at $.50, you're not worried about the price right now. If anything, all signs are pointing to the next big bubble. Shaky hands dropping from fear involving China is to be expected. Fear in bitcoin is not a new thing. We have seen it over, and over, and over again.

You're oversimplfying the issue a bit. When most people say that they are against regulation, they usually mean extreme/excessive regulation. I would say very rarely do they actually mean ZERO regulation, which obviously leaves the door wide open for scams and fraud.

Bitpay didn't wait for even a single confirmation for the $2k Amazon gift card I bought during the Black Friday event. Why would it be necessary to do so for a typical small transaction?
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:59:33
I use my Coinbase wallet as my hotwallet, as it has 2FA. Blockchain.info has 2FA. Many of the phone apps can be considered 2FA as long as your data is kept local to the device and the app merely allows you access to that data. And because your cell phone wallet is physical, that's an additional level of security if you need to push a button to confirm a transaction (which is basically all Trezor is--a physical button).
2FA is pretty common now, so there's not much excuse for not using it. 
Cold storage doesn't really need 2FA, as the definition of cold storage includes that data not being online in the first place (i.e. unhackable). Though you could create cold storage multiple factor authentication by breaking up a cold storage wallet into multiple fragments, sort of like a horcrux. So that option is there as well, if physical cold storage wallets need that additional security measure. And you could add any number of levels of encryption on top of that as well.

The people you're buying from have fees they have to pay to get the coins. Most exchanges are about .5%. Coinbase is 1%. Then, those people have to spend time to meet you to exchange currencies. Their time costs money. 
If you want to buy bitcoin as inexpensively as possible, you have to go through the KYC and AML procedures that most exchanges are required to operate under.
CampBX accepts money orders, so maybe go that route.

Awesome--can't wait.
Joe has mentioned bitcoin a few times during podcasts since Andreas' first appearance. Once was in regards to something failing (I forget what it was) and he said "got bitcoined", so Andreas may want to let him know that bitcoin is just fine, rather a single centralized platform failed etc.
When he was promoting Ting he absolutely railed against Apple for shutting down the bitcoin wallets, which was great to hear.
The other was when David Seaman was on and when David suggested that Onnit start selling goods for bitcoin someday Joe made another one of those *not sure about that* comments, so he's still a bit skeptical and uncertain about it.
Let's be real--it can take some time for the idea of this new technology to sink in, so it's just part of that natural process. Joe is so busy with many jobs he probably hasn't really educated himself on it, but in due time...  I'm sure he'll be intrigued with all of the recent Dorian/Satoshi press.

That's the same type of thing that the LBC sellers in florida got picked up for--selling bitcoin with the knowledge that they were being used in commission of a crime.
Now let me say that I support Charlie because I think the drug war is bullshit, I think money laundering is bullshit (Money is Not a Crime), and I hope he gets off.

There's really no such thing as a *physical bitcoin*. All Casascius coins--and similar-- are, are fancy collectible cold storage/offline wallets. But you never know if the person who made the wallet kept the private key to it, so it's not a good method of storage.
Collector's coins are NOT bitcoins. They just have the private address included with them, that allows you to access the actual bitcoin. They look nice, but that's where their usefulness ends.

There are a some trusted members in the bitcoin community who would be much better in leading this charge. Why should Sunlot, who is coming from our of nowhere, and who we know have been than than truthful be given not only the trust of every creditor, but the keys to the vault?

Pretty much all websites do all sorts of things without telling the user. 
Look at a website as your property. You can do whatever you like with your property, and if a visitor doesn't like what you're doing, they can leave--whether on your physical property or your virtual property.
Going there is literally voluntary. This mechanism doesn't harm you in any way, so if you disagree with how the site is operating then you can simply not go there.
And your comparison to malware is very bad because you're comparing something that causes harm to something that does not. 
No I don't see the difference. Aren't ads using YOUR electricity and YOUR processing power to be displayed? And are you warned about the ads and/or required to submit to an agreement before being shown the ads? No. (Well actually the agreement is simply choosing to go there. When you voluntarily choose to go there you are agreeing.) And because neither you or your property were *harmed*--same as with regards to advertisements--you have no claim against the site owner.

That's not a problem with selling miners, that's a problem with doing a pre-order in which delivery will take more than 30 days. Paypal rules state that anything paid through Paypal must be delivered within 30 days.

It's not quite that simple. You can't forget that bitcoin *right now* is inflationary. 3600 BTC are added to the pool every single day. That's over 3 million USD in value that might be going out into the market or possibly being off-market to hedge funds etc. (they love to buy directly from miners).

That first part isn't entirely correct. I personally bought my very first bitcoin from Bitinstant (they used ZipZap to process) back in the day. I've never had an account at Gox. The coins were sent directly to my requested address.
Selling bitcoin on SR was definitely not an illegal activity so I agree, the rest is moot.
I totally agree with the rest of what you said--cheers. It was a witch hunt, plain and simple.
The calls came from senators, if not higher, to take down SR and anything related was free game. What we're seeing is a result of that policy.

It's literally not possible. One cannot disprove a negative, which is why the burden of proof is on the claimant.
Even if Satoshi had an alibi, was being watched live on television by a billion people and surrounded by witnesses while the supposed *real Satoshi* signed his key live online, that still does not remove the possibility that this person is doing so under the instructions of Dorian.

No worries, I had a hard time getting my mind around some of these things when I began learning about bitcoin.
The Facebook comparison above is on of my favorites because at any time, thousands of Facebook clones, or Twitters clones, could be created (improvements on them, even) but the hard part is getting people to use them. The large number of people create the massive network effect with those services as well. 
You could make exanomyCoin or exanomybook, but who will use them? Even if a large corporation, or even a country makes their own coin, it's hard to imagine it being more successful than bitcoin because bitcoin is already global. And a a decentralized currency is free for all to use and is immune to internal control mechanisms of a company or a government, so who would want to use those inferior options of GoogleCoin or GovCoin?
It's not so much as what's possible, as what's improbable and at this point bitcoin being dethroned as the top crypto is highly unlikely.
Check out some of the other coins: 
Creating a coin is not easy, and especially in the early months they are incredibly subject to not only manipulation but complete failure due to all sorts of attacks. There are many coins that have failed, so you may be interested in some of those, and how/why they did fail.

Yes, but the vast majority will be mined in the next 20 years. There will be but a trickle incoming after that. After 2028 there will only be 225 minted per day, compared to today's 3600. 2040's rate is a mere 28 per day.

It is impossible with BITCOIN. It's just not impossible in the bitcoin space. In fact it's incredibly easy, as the market is currently completely unregulated.
I'm not dishonest or ignorant. We're talking apples and oranges. It's impossible to inflate a bitcoin, *an actual bitcoin* on the blockchain. A bitcoin on Gox is not an *actual bitcoin*.

That's insane. Sure if you're merely a speculator it's probably no big deal, especially if you just buy a bit now and then, to hold, and occasionally use some to buy something.
But if you're using bitcoin daily, you're talking about thousands of *uses* per year. And to have to record each one, look up the exchange rate of that day and calculate the appreciated value for each and every one of those transactions throughout the entirety of the year is far beyond the realm of the realistic. No fucking way.

You don't need anyone working for you if you're just free to do what you want. You don't need to be "allowed" to do it. You just can because you're free. And a major plus is, instead of making people work FOR YOU, people will want to work WITH you.

No. The current unequal distribution is due to corruption, backroom deals, crony capitalism, and abuse of power.
People don't have a choice what family, what country, what state, what wealth or poverty that they are born into. But they do have a choice about whether or not they own bitcoin. Those who have chosen to do so have benefited and may continue to do so.

I've listened to David Seaman's podcasts and some of what he says leads me to believe he's not really much of an *expert* on bitcoin (even though he mentions he sells a small e-book about Bitcoin on Amazon).

Are you dumb? I don't know, but you just said a bunch of stupid shit. You speak as if you know nothing regarding the topic and nothing of the history of your own country.
His point is: If there's a crime, prosecute the crime. The money has nothing to do with it (only as much as they decide that they get to seize/steal it for themselves if they find it).
You want to talk about murder? Alrighty. Someone kills someone with a knife. Should the knife manufacturer, or the store that sold it, be guilty in some way with regards to the *actual* crime of murder? No, because the knife wasn't the crime. The knife really had nothing to do with the crime. It's just an inanimate object--like money. Murder was the crime, so prosecute the murder.

If someone wants to do something that harms them self, that's their choice and it's nearly impossible to stop them so why bother? All it does is hurt people who aren't trying to harm themselves by occasionally taking a substance that only rarely harms and usually only if it is ABUSED.

Yes, bitcoin requires internet access, access the vendor would provide. Offline wallets like the trezor will help consumer adoption so they are necessary, and ideally they will be hackproof. Gaining access to the internet only when they tap would be ideal which is why I bring it up. That would be much easier and user friendly than having to plug a trezor-like device in. If the offline wallet could simply be tapped the same way a credit card or a phone is tapped then adoption could piggyback on that technology and vendor would not have to have a special device, tool, application, or POS just for bitcoin users.

They "lost" value buying in close to 1k/btc and have not yet seen profits from bitcoin value appreciation.

You can manufacture "volume" by simply sending coins to new addresses. The meaningful figure is not network volume or exchange volume, it is the volume used for purchase of actual goods and services.

You're not asking anyone to "bear the risk". You're just selling for USD rate, and accepting bitcoin at the rate it is when they purchase it. Returns would be given at that exact USD price--it's not that complicated of a policy. And it's not hard for the consumer to understand as long as they know the policy upfront, so they don't feel they were cheated after the fact.
Until the volatility subsides, there's really no other option or you will have people arbitraging the value with returns.

All we see is the amount of coins that move places. Calling that "trading volume" is a huge overstatement. 
Good for you. I also never touched Gox, in fact, warnings against using Gox from members here is one of the first things I remember reading about when I found myself here early last year. So for the life of me I can't understand why so many people had not only used that rathole, but kept their coins there indefinitely.

Say you walk into a room full of people, each person holding a gun to their own head. The most reasonable response is not to point to the person with the "The U.S." name tag and say "The US isn't the only one with the problem".  All that needs to be said is *put the fucking guns down*.

Mixers are not money laundering. Money laundering means you're trying to basically clean cash after a crime and make it appear that that cash was obtained through legitimate means. It is a complex, multiple step process and mere mixing does not meet the criteria.

I'm not pissed if I know the policy ahead of time. Any fool can understand (when explained) that if you don't do this, you will have people returning things when the bitcoin price rises, and then that sucks for everyone because then the vendor would have to pass those losses onto the next customers, etc.
If I buy a $100 item with USD on January 10 @ 2 p.m. PST then that value is locked at that moment. If I want a return in the future, then I will receive that $100 USD value back in USD or bitcoin. Pretty simple.

So, typical "I missed the boat, it's not fair" mentality. 
If your dreamcoin came out today when 99% of the world still doesn't know about cryptocurrencies, but you got to mine/buy them on Day One, would that be fair to everyone, or just you?
Satoshi released the whitepaper before he even released the protocol, and when the latter was released, anyone could mine--so your claim is bunk. It was fair, just not many people believed in it. But those who did, got rewarded. That's how it should be.

I'm not pretending anything troll. I didn't say it doesn't matter--it just matters very little as far as actual bitcoin use goes.
Yes, over $2m worth of coins are being added to the economy daily and given that fact it's fairly remarkable that price is still up as much as it is considering the low of $31.

I don't think bitcoin institutions need regulation. Exchanges like btc-e are not operating under your divine regulations and they are just fine because they are doing what their customers want. If they were not doing so, their business would end in hours or days. 
The single reason why we didn't have a top class exchange in the U.S. for the past 3 years, and still do not have one today, is due to fear of what "regulators" might do. The reason people were harmed by Gox (an organization that had many problems, constantly) is because competitors who would have offered better services were literally not allowed to set up shop.

The supply is finite, **but not right now**. Right now there is 3600 coins being pumped into the economy every single day. At the current rate that's close to $2m so even the price going down over the short term by a small amount is enormously bullish for the long term.
Millions of dollars being pumped into most small markets caps, would kill that market with inflation in no time at all. So the fact that bitcoin is so much up from last years price of $31 is nothing short of amazing, yet you're only looking at and talking about a very short section of the timeline. Look at the big picture.

No I wasn't full of shit. I stated the general policy. It's there in black and white you dense troll.
20 days is not "optional". It is the hard policy unless you get approved for an extended delivery time, and in this case then they basically escrow the funds until the goods are delivered. 
BFL **DID NOT DO THIS** which is what caused all of the problems. That's why I said what I said--that it wasn't a problem with *miners* it was a problem with pre-orders which were not delivered as per the policy. 
If they had miners which were sold and were ready for shipping at the time of sale, or miners which shipped within 20 days, then there would have never been an issue.

The majority would not, no. The U.S. government cannot even stop drugs from entering their prisons, so the idea that they could stop people from using a non-physical "product" is ridiculous. The best they could do is crackdown on fiat conversion and businesses using it.
But even if all of that happens, the black/grey markets worldwide is huge. Even if bitcoin is only ever used for "illicit" goods/services it could still be wildly successful in comparison to today's price. 
Example: if bitcoin was only used in 1% of all black/grey markets, the price would have to be over $50k per coin.
I have no idea what's going to happen, I just know that it's not a simple binary scenario of: If government doesn't allow it, it will be useless and fail. That's not true for any banned substance, especially considering that most banned products are actually physical and require physical transportation etc.

lol, investments/speculation should be contributions to society now? Ridiculous.
Bitcoin is hardly a waste of resources. The security is built in. How much do companies spend each year using armored trucks to transport their physical money for them? How much time is spent by all parties in the loop dealing with and counting that physical money? How much is lost in fraud with counterfeit dollars? And how much is lost in having to pay people to try to prevent that fraud?
Bitcoin, in comparison, is incredibly efficient.
Early adopters did earn it. They spent their time studying it, and hundreds of thousands of man hours have been spent working on it. It's not like they "got lucky", as you're foolishly suggesting. They supported the network early on, which is why it is where it is today--and up many thousands of percent over what it initially began trading for at $0.05 each.
If you missed out? Tough shit. That's life. There are thousands of things you miss out on every day. Blaming bitcoin and early adopters is just pathetic.

To answer your question, I don't care what anyone thinks. People called bitcoin dead at $1, at $9, at $30, and now you're calling it dead at $400? What's next in your pattern of irony? $1200? Will it finally be dead at $1200?
The most harsh criticism always comes from people who not only don't understand the technology, but who have not taken the time to educate themselves about it. Why would I value or care about such an opinion or about he or she who ignorantly makes snap-judgments.
Do you think Einstein cared about people who didn't understand his concepts? You could spend every day of your life arguing with people who don't get it, or you can  innovate with people who do. It's not exactly a tough decision about which to do.
You mention how bitcoin is "crashing hard" but you conveniently leave out that last year the value was only ~$30. And not long before that it was worth pennies. If you choose a glass-half-empty approach, that's on you. It's not my problem that I need to deal with. 
By all means *don't use bitcoin* if you see no value in it. It doesn't matter to us, and we don't need to convince you of anything. If you don't see the benefits of a money that cannot be "printed" into oblivion, of decentralized trustless transactions, and of the first existence of digital scarcity [all of which are just the tip of the iceberg], then by all means stick to your fiat and go back to your funny cat pictures or your sports or whatever you'd rather do with your time.

If it's not profitable that doesn't matter. That has nothing to do with whether or not the website owner should have the freedom and the right to run their site any way they see fit, e.g. NOT ILLEGAL.
There's no reason someone shouldn't be able to do this. People are using YOUR ELECTRICITY to display their ads, right? The point is, you choose whether or not to go to a website. If you don't like it, don't go there.
And why should there have to be a disclaimer? Is there a disclaimer on all websites that warn that companies are using your data and personal information to monetize? No? Then why the ridiculous requirement for this setup?
Furthermore, this is barely more than just an idea right now. It was never truly implemented, and if it were it would obviously not be profitable right now.

It may be "best practice" security-wise to wait for at least one confirmation, but one cannot dismiss the downside in some specific scenarios.

The market will grow and the whales will lose their power to move the market. That has already happened for the most part. Most of the pump-n-dumpers moved onto litecoin initially because bitcoin wasn't volatile enough for them.

Who knows what's happening with Gox... but many of us have known for well over a year now not to use that exchange (after there were alternatives). 
So the people who were trading there and enjoying the higher volatility were taking a risk. And now, for some people with bitcoin or funds there, it might not have paid off.
The best action is for people to leave and Gox will either no longer be a thing or it will no longer have any real influence on bitcoin. The market naturally exposes and lays waste to bad actors and we're seeing that now.

No they absolutely do not have to. Look, if a contract killer agrees to kill someone he is told is a child-raping worse-than-Hitler scumbag, but upon locating and observing his target, realizes that he is the  kindest, moral person on the planet... he has basically two options. 
1) Not kill the person because he doesn't kill innocent/good people and he was not the told the complete truth.
2) Kill the person because he signed a contract and likely fears repercussions from the people he signed the contract with.
Either way, he does have a choice. He does not **have to**, as you say, do anything.
He can choose 1) and deal with the consequences (and maybe he'll even win), or he can choose 2), and kindly explain to his mark that he's sorry for the mistake but he has to do what he signed a contract to do.
Whatever he **chooses**, it's ultimately his fault for signing a contract that he can't get out of if and when the situation changes in a way that goes against his moral code.
absolutely has a choice--objectively, without a doubt. There may or may not be consequences, if he doesn't allow Garza in, but you simply cannot say that there is no choice, with all due respect.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:22:08
So they should have done their research. 
Or they should require an oath of ethics in the contract so that if new information comes out exposing the signer as a scammer, the contract is void and he/she is not allowed to attend.

While true, they can't go back in time and hindsight is always 20/20.

Maybe not, and for the sake of argument let us assume this is true.
My second point stands, in that the organizer could have all sorts of preventive caveats in their contracts that void the contract in a situation like this. That they didn't foresee possible scams in this space (Really?), that is on them.
There is a way out. The event has not happened yet. They don't **have to** physically let him into the venue and they don't have to let him have a booth, and they don't have to have Paybase plastered all over the walls--they CHOOSE to.
They may choose to because they fear a lawsuit. But their incompetence in signing a contract they can't get out of that incentivizes them into letting a scammer in is their fault alone, so they are to blame for that as well.

What? People have been trying to steer the community away from Gox for well over a year now. Those who didn't heed that warning are the only ones who lost.
How many times have you read about paper wallets and cold storage? Everyone has and you damn well know it. Gox was not even an effective exchange for close to a year now (very few fiat withdrawals), so there were LOTS of signs one would need to ignore to willingly leave coins on Gox, and taking the risk of doing so.

The Constitution isn't made of magical paper. It can be eroded and ignored, or preserved and improved upon, at will by the legislators in office.
But you're right to point out that the laws in the UK are **less moral**.
Constitutionality is meaningless because judges can interpret the Constitution any way they see fit. What should be saying is: "There has to be something immoral about that."

Love you Erik...
But they CHOSE to have him there. That's like letting a fire-and-brimstone spewing nutjob into your living room, he scares the shit out of your children, and then you blame him for being there. And after all of that, there are claims of "but free speech". 
**No.** That is not free speech. Allowing him onto a legitimate (if, only seemingly legitimate to a quasi outsider/bitcoin noob) platform to continue running his scams is not free speech. Not allowing him is being responsible and more-so, honorable, by not taking his dirty stolen money.
This is how it would work in a free society. Instead of initiating violence against him and locking him up in a cage (very costly, furthering the damage done to his victims and society), he is cast away, never to be trusted again. **But you have to stop the bleeding.** And that happens when he is no longer allowed the avenues in which to operate his scam. And when he moves in to a new space, people are informed about his past there as well.
Everyone else speaking at that conference should be LIVID that this guy was allowed this platform. So blame the organizers who took his money.
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:31:39
The contract killer example merely shows the logic and reasoning from a universal objectivist standpoint.
You keep saying choice is limited to simply allowing Garza and Paybase to have a presence at the conference. But that's clearly incorrect. He COULD choose to not allow Garza to attend. He could do that. That's a fact. And if he makes that choice, then he may indeed suffer consequences due to the contract he willingly signed. 
But you keep saying he doesn't have a choice, and as I believe I've demonstrated, he certainly does have a choice.
I never said any of the organizers is a scammer, just that they should not allow the scammers in, and not become a profiteer and an accomplice of the scammers by willful association.
The conference doesn't need to be ruined. The organizers could make the choice to proceed with the conference but to not let Garza and Paybase to attend. That is an option. That is a choice. And I've not seen anyone but yourself suggest cancelling the event is even anoption. The conference **can** go on without Garza is my whole point.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:05:35
Please do not serve us the bullshit platter that you don't have a choice in whether or not to allow this scammer to speak, to allow this scammer to have a booth, and to plaster Paybase all over the walls and on advertisements.
You do have a choice. 
Maybe whatever contracts you have people sign should include caveats that void the contract if and when fraud is observed. **Is it really shocking to you scammers may be operating in this space?** You should have done and should do everything you can to protect yourself, as well as the community from these scammers. 
Saying the show must go on is a ridiculous position to take. You can have the choice to not let him in, so don't try to convince us otherwise. 
Do the right thing and the community will stand beside you.

Oh yeah, I wasn't being unrealistic. I looked up the USPS Parcel Post cost, which was around $20. Amazon works that cost into their "free shipping" when applicable, so I'm paying for it either way. I'd just prefer to pay less and receive it whenever than have to pay over $60.

Of course you shouldn't have to report every single small purchase. Do you do that with any other form of payment/currency? It's ridiculous and completely unrealistic.
Every currency fluctuates in value--though very much less so than bitcoin. You just don't usually notice it because if you have been using a single currency all your life, then that currency is the one that is used as the basis of comparison to any other. So it appears to be motionless while everything else is moving.
If we don't have to do that bullshit with fiat, we shouldn't have to do it with bitcoin. Note: This has nothing to do with reporting of income taxes.

It's exactly that, and it's also an arbitrarily named compounded crime, after the fact.
Say I steal a Snickers bar from a mini-mart. That's the crime. But say there were also "laws" that said:
* "One cannot walk with stolen property."
* "One cannot eat stolen property."
* "One cannot give stolen property away as a gift."
* "One cannot sell stolen property."
* "One cannot take stolen property into your residence."
* "One cannot destroy stolen property."
So, those laws could be made, and then anything you actually do with the stolen item (which is a given, because the motive for theft is clearly having to do with doing *something* with it... like eating the damn candy bar) just stacks more "crimes" on top of the first. But of course, there's only one act/crime that **actually harmed the store owner**, and that's the theft. 
So money laundering is just a compounded crime stacked on theft or whatever the actual crime is, because of course people are going to actually *use* the money as a transmission of value. That's its only practical use. Like eating the candy bar.

Nope, there are no countries. Countries are only concepts in people's heads. You're just so used to them being a thing, that without thought you think they exist. Show me where a country exists.

You're just talking about "laws", rules made by man. Except you conveniently leave out that there are none of those rules that everyone agrees with. So all you get in the end is people in power making rules based on what they want or what people who pay them want. Those are mostly arbitrary rules based on a sour mixture of power and selfishness, not on PRINCIPLE and MORALITY.
This is why slavery was legal and enforced by the state. 
Want to marry an 8-year-old? That was legal too.
Want to do anything you want to your wife? Legal, because you own her. 
Want to do anything you want to your daughter? Legal, because you own her too.
Everything the German nazi government did was legal.
Anything someone wants to be legal/illegal, it can be writ and then it is law... and none of it based on morality.
Today is no different. These times are still those times. Now you have to pay $270,000 for a cab license in some places.
In others you have to have a license to be an interior decorator.
One plant is "legal" in one state but not the next. But which is right? Because they can't both be *objectively* right. If one is right the other is surely wrong--or maybe they're both wrong. 
And that's what you get when "laws" are not based on morality *especially in a democracy*. They're based on human wants alone, very often based on the diseased minds of the sociopathic minority. Even gang-rape is a democratic process.
No, I don't have to compromise. Maybe you should compromise yourself by not allowing people to have the power to make whatever laws they want. If you're worried that some people are bad, then you can't have positions of power that those people can get into.

Life's not fair. You could say the same about land ownership. "Hey, I was just born and all of the land is owned, not fair". 
The important thing is equal opportunity.
Yes, bitcoin was easy to get back in the day but almost no one wanted it. Most people alive at the time *could have been involved* but were not. It was practically worthless for years. So to be mad that something became valuable *because other people made it valuable* is irrational. That's like getting angry (jealous, really) at a master artist who turns a cheap block of marble into a masterpiece that sells for 9 figures. 
*The early adopters helped create the value*, and if they held onto the bitcoin that is *their* reward. Someone who had nothing to do with it deserves nothing.
Lastly I would say if a dictatorial actor tried doing a bunch of unfair shit, no one would want to use *their poker table's money*. Bitcoin is open source, provably fair, all the rules are known, and that's why people want to use it--that's why it has value. Stalinbucks, Hitlerbucks, etc. were naturally realized as the shit they always were just as every fiat currency in history has.

Cops are just people. They are not machines and they do not/should not have special rights. 
If someone is attacking you, I can defend you from that initiation of violence. So can a cop. But if you have a substance in your home that I don't like (or that I want) I don't get to bust in at 3 in the morning, shoot your dogs, scare the shit out of you and your family, take your stuff and drag you away and throw you into a little cage.

With ALL due respect--and I respect you greatly--stick to worrying about the protocol and stop focusing on how the guys with the guns will perceive what you're doing. Getting in bed with them will end badly one way or another.
Many of us were against the lobbying projects and were vocal about that in 2013. The board did not listen. That's where your money went. Trying to convince, to beg, the guys with the guns to allow you to exist. And in the end, it didn't work because it never would.

You're committing a fallacy from the outset of any examination by assuming a government is necessary for society. 
If government took over... computer manufacturing, and 50 years down the road most people have now never lived in a world in which the governments weren't the sole producers of computers, you would certainly have people saying things like: "Explain then how to run a computer factory/design etc. and/or support its citizens computer needs without revenue."  **And you know, right now, for damn sure that governments don't create computers, nor are they even a slightly necessary step in the process of creating one.**
I don't need to cite any examples to disprove your illogical argument. How about you address my universal argument I made in my initial post? If enough people believe in, or support the idea that 2+2 makes 5, *does that make it true*?
You can attempt to justify theft all you want, but it's still theft. You're in the middle of a desert with your family and nothing but Soros owned market within 200 miles. You steal water from a 100+ Billion dollar conglomerate to save the lives of your family. That's great, I would too. But it doesn't make it NOT theft.

An addiction to monetary units didn't save Rome. It doesn't matter what people are used to if the Dollar loses value and no longer functions.
You seem to be operating under the assumption that the U.S. Dollar will last forever. Well, no fiat currency has lasted forever. Young children who trade/deal in multiple currencies in some countries have no problem getting used to new currency markets. The faith of the Dollar would just have to get bad enough for enough people to "flip" and there would be an avalanche effect, and people would get used to the new thing in no time.

Of course it's theft, by textbook dictionary definition. Something taken away from you by force is theft. Just because enough people think it's justified doesn't make it *not theft*. Is executing someone in Saudi Arabia for leaving the Islamic faith *not murder*, just because the people in power sanction it? No, it's still murder. And it's still murder even if every single person in the country supports it. So taxation **is** theft, that enough people/the majority support. And even if every single person on the planet supports it, it's STILL theft, just like if every person on the planet supports the statement: 2+2=5... it would still make them wrong. Truth cannot be determined democratically. And anything taken away from you by force or threat of force (assuming you didn't steal it from someone else first), then *that is theft*.

Many people have bitcoin holdings, so their financial interest is threatened if bitcoin loses value.
An unbiased person with no conflicts of interest knows that competition is a good thing. But a majority holder of a certain coin has picked a pony, and want that horse to take first place.

Oh really? Because I think it *is* a payment system, I am a facilitator of ponzi? Do you even use bitcoin or are you just aboard the speculatory train? 
I just paid someone in fucking France for a job I needed help with. It took literally 5 seconds to paste their address into the address field and click send.
How is that not a payment system? How is that not utility? You fucktard.
Of course many people need to get involved for it to work *well*, so that bitcoin is very fungible. That doesn't make it a ponzi scheme. How well would a $700 cell phone work if only 1% of people use phones?
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:40:43
If they don't then what is already happening--with companies taking transactions off the blockchain--will just happen more.
The more that happens, the less transactions there will be and... less transactions fees and transaction rewards.
I think the mining pool heads are smart enough to realize, that is a game they should never try to play. Especially when the block reward has halved another time or two, they really will be needing those transaction rewards. As of now, they're just sort of a nice afterthought.

Great post--this should be on the front page.
If these guys paid $1300 per coin or anywhere close, then that is pretty huge.
I see 2 possible scenarios assuming this information is true (which, I think it's safe to say that it is):
1) Short-term bearishness by people looking to manipulate the market so that they can buy coins for as cheaply as possible prior to a run-up. Then, mid-term bullish due to the bullish news to come.
2) Short-term *and* mid-term bullishness due to the rumor and then the news. We saw 708 yesterday (Bitstamp). If we don't see it again by Jan. 2, then that is hugely bullish.

I'm not saying bitcoin is from heaven. I'm just saying it's something economies have never experienced before. So there's no way anyone here learned about it, or its possible implications, in school.
Will it work? Who knows. But I certainly don't like how fiat is "working" against me, as it stands. The experiment that is bitcoin will be taking place, either way.
And personally, I like the idea of saving up for a house for a few years and actually being able to actually buy a house--or a large percentage of one. Some people are having to save for a number of years just to pay a 5% or 10% down payment on one. This inflationary thing you claim that we *must have* is not working for people in general. Those at the head of the machine? Them it's working for.
Edit and P.S:  And a 10% payment on a house is not even the norm anymore. 20% used to be standard. Now the majority people are barely able to scratch together **3%**. 3% is becoming the norm. I think that says a lot.

I am taking it into account. We have similar situations right now with bank funds etc. that are absolutely dependable, literally and psychologically in the eyes of the consumer.
There's no reason why off-chain transactions can't becomes the norm if miners try to strong-arm for higher fees.
If fact, off-chain transaction domination might end up happening anyways with built-in escrow and dispute resolution being such a necessary part off commerce. And let's face it: most consumers can't be and shouldn't be dealing with the intricate nature of bitcoin wallet security, anyways. 
But sure, mining pools could evolve to do something like that too. It will be interesting to see how it works out.

Ideally, yes.
So yeah, there's no way for that to coincide with "online". So best practice, is to just use both--cold storage with the ability to send to your online "hot wallet" at any given time or just keep a small % of your bitcoin holding online for purchases etc.  And you can easily do that with Armory, right now which is what I do.

Sorry, I don't want my ability for instant buys do be reduced or disabled because some people don't use proper security measures.
And if the price drops in a major way, I want the opportunity to capitalize on that by buying more than I would have otherwise planned on. That means your 24-hour wait to increase my buy limit would impede that, as some flash crashes last minutes or hours.
Besides, if someone gains access to your account, they could just increase this buy limit, no? How is that a solution?
You're attacking symptoms, not causes. Proper security is the key. Your "system" would impede fraud and thievery, yes, but it would also impede business. That's bad for Coinbase, and bad for its customers who do use proper security measures.

100k isn't all that much, so a buy order of that size wouldn't move the market much. If you were buying millions you would want a more strategic plan as you buy so that the price doesn't rise as you're buying.
Are you in the U.S.? If so, I'd just use Coinbase or Bitstamp. You're not going to get any "special deal" for a measly 150 coins.
On Coinbase, you can buy 50 a day. If you use Bitstamp, I'd buy in stacks of 10 or 20 over a couple of days.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:12:01

Hardly a fair comparison. When you use a credit card somewhere you hand over all the credit card information to that vendor.
But when you buy with bitcoin you definitely never have to give them your private key. So hacking Target, or whatever they did there, would never net the thieves your monetary information.

Very true, and I understand the concern. And those people often have *really lost* money--rather than sort-of, but not really feel like they lost money in a kind of abstract way. My main point stands, that unless someone sells for less than they bought for, then they literally have not sustained an actual loss.
And besides that, I think the last thing we should be projecting is that this type of occurrence is the type of thing that people should be thinking about suicide for to begin with. Some people who rightly thought this was not that big of a deal (because, normal volatility) might all of a sudden be wondering: *Shit, should I be worried cause people are really talking about suicide over this?*
I guess that's the other edge of the sword. But I think we should be projecting calm, and explain to people what's going on before they make some rash decision that they really might regret. Once that loss is realized, then there really is no going back.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:09:37

The biggest one of all--no group of people control it. No fundamental manipulation. Equality of funds for everyone. That is--or seems--great for the masses, but not so great for those who currently enjoy their powerful controlling methods.
Up til now we have all thought of government money as just... money because that is all we have known.

@_date: 2013-12-27 21:20:24
Yes, anything online is a hot wallet. Cold storage is specifically defined as OFFLINE. And some people include in that defintion, not only as offline, but *has never been online*. If someone skims your password and somehow bypasses your 2FA, your coins are gone. If someone steals your phone and you have 2FA, your coins could be gone. If someone breaks into your home, steals your computer and has access to all of your history, your coins could be gone.
Example:  Did you make a cold storage/paper wallet via Coinbase or Blockchain.info? Then that might not be strictly in cold storage, because someone, someday could assess that private key.
Even if you use a cold storage wallet like Armory, did you do that from an online computer? Did you print out the private key via a printer which has files that can be accessed if someone might get remote access to your system? If the answers to those scenarios are yes, then you might not have true cold storage after all.
Some online wallets only have so much of their coin online in hot wallets, like Coinbase. So if Coinbase gets hacked, they can't get all of Coinbase's coins. But that doesn't prevent anyone from gaining access to any individual user's coins (unless an individual user has more coins in Coinbase than they have in their hot wallet at any given time). So from a user's standpoint, it doesn't matter as much if Coinbase has a 10%-15% hot wallet. Coinbase's fractional hot wallet protects Coinbase, not you.

@_date: 2013-12-18 17:49:15
Of course it's fucking ridiculous. It's a volatile market. **Everyone knows this**. It could drop 50% and be up the same amount next week.
Plus, a loss is only only realized if your friend were to sell. So it's incredibly inaccurate to say that he lost money, especially if and when the price is back where it was last week, next week. So it's quite ridiculous to contemplate suicide when there hasn't even been true loss yet. Not to mention that even if he did lose all of his money, that's still only 40,000 dollars. Anyone's life is worth more than that.

I'm not asking him to be 100% correct (whatever that means). But if you've listened to everything he has said about bitcoin it's strikingly obvious that he has not even taken the time to learn about it. Listen to his talk with Ed &amp; Ethan. Listen to his debate with Erik Voorhees. Listen to his nonsense about carrying around Valcambi gold bars and suggesting that we try to actually buy things with those. He's wrong over and over and over again--about even the basics.
If someone is going to have a meaningful opinion about something, then they need to educate themselves about it. Otherwise, their opinion is a farce, and means precisely shit.
