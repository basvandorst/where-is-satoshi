c) Except that he created doge*coin* and if he pronounces it *dohjcoin* then that's what it is, regardless of how others may pronounce the *doge* in the case of the meme.
d) That's true. Except that dogecoin is not a meme. It is a crypto-currency based on a meme.
That said, potato potahto. Personally I'm inclined to stick with the pronunciation that the creator of dogecoin goes with, because for all intents and purposes that ***is*** the "official" pronunciation. I think that makes the best case. But if other people want to pronounce it differently, that's their choice.

I would say it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel. There are already open-source crypto-based anonymous distributed file sharing networks, might as well use one of them. [Freenet]( for example.

Wish I had that kind of money to invest, but coming from a low income household, $163 for my Jalapeno was an extreme amount. If I would have just bought BTC directly with the $163, I would have had ~7.5 BTC, worth over $5,000 and rising now.
Regrets, regrets :-/
I've said a few times in the last week that not investing in Bitcoin when I first heard of them in August 2011 will probably go down as the biggest missed opportunity of my entire life. I wish I could stop thinking about it.

I thought about changing the number of days into Dates, but Google Spreadsheets Charts drew the lines in 100 Day increments and I didn't feel like doing the math to carve them up into month-sized chunks. I'm also a complete greenhorn to statistics so I don't know what "prediction confidence bands" are.

I'm with you 100% - It is an offline LiveCD whose *sole* purpose is to generate addresses and print a paper wallet. It is not "everything Bitcoin related bundled on a read only disk".
Anyone who buys this guy's CD is paying $47 for a FOSS HTML file and some Javascript with an entire 600MB+ live operating system attached. Way way way overkill.
I (or someone more skilled than me) could create a statically linked trimmed-down live os in just several tens of megabytes that could do the same as this.

If that's sarcasm, that's too bad. I'd be perfectly happy with $4 a day. Coming from a very low income household, that would be a significant increase to my monthly income. And it's certainly better than making 12 cents a day (and in the end losing money due to electricity costs) with my GPU.

I'm a member of the Bitcoin community who orderd my Jalapeno in February, was informed that the wait would be so long that they couldn't confidently give an accurate estimate, and I received my order months later in August.
Am I unhappy with the wait? Sure. Am I unhappy with BFL? Sorta. Do I think they're committing fraud? Absolutely not.
They had trouble gaining traction. They have been closing the gap between orders and shipments in a steadily increasing fashion (I actually plotted a graph of it last month). They are not committing fraud.
People just need to stop whining. If you don't like BFL, don't use them. They are *not* committing fraud, and frankly they're not even dishonest. They have been intentionally vague because 1) They don't actually have the skill to accurately predict shipment times (at least didn't prior to some weeks ago) and 2) They're actually being *more* honest by *not* telling people they'll receive their order by a specific date which they know they probably aren't able to achieve.

It's all fields, not just finance.
If you go to school for software development or server administration, you'll be taught that Microsoft, Adobe, CISCO, and Sun are the end-all-be-all superior organizations in their fields. If any FOSS (free open source software) is mentioned at all, universities will spread lies of FOSS being inferior and say "you get what you pay for, there's a reason it's free" with no further justification (because there is none - most FOSS alternatives are typically superior in both performance and security because the entire community can see the source and report and even fix bugs and exploits themselves and send the patches upstream).

Agreed - my Jalapeno barely paid for itself because I got it just early enough for it to do so. Now it makes me around $1.50 a day. But even if it made me nothing, I'd still run it. Only costs me about a dollar a month for the ~37W it draws, and it's worth it to me to contribute to verifying transactions.

It sounds like you know more than me about this. Thank you for volunteering to draw up a more accurate graph!
(By the way yes they were just drawn in Photoshop by eyeball. I tried to find a way to plot an average/trend line in Google Spreadsheet Charts, but couldn't find a way to do so unless I got extremely involved with the Google Docs API. This way was easier.)

known as "FriendlyChemist" began sending threats to DPR through
Silk Road's private message system. In these messages,
"FriendlyChemist" stated that he had a long list of real names and
addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers that he had
obtained from hacking into the computer of another, larger Silk
Road vendor. "FriendlyChemist" threatened to publish the
information on the Internet unless DPR gave him $500,000, which
indicated he needed to pay off his narcotics


he followed through on this threat:


usernames, ordr amounts, addresses get leaked? all
those people will leave sr [Silk Road] and be scared
to use it again. those vendors will all be busted and
all there customers will be exposed too and never go
back to sr.


sample of the usernames, addresses, and order information he
intended to leak. Also, as proof that he had obtained the data
from the vendor whose computer he claimed to have hacked,
supplied the vendor's username and password on
Silk Road so that DPR could verify it.


stating: "Have your suppliers contact me here so I can work
something out with them."


"redandwhite" contacted DPR, stating: was asked to Contact
you. We are the people "FriendlyChemist" owes money to.






wanted to be in communication with you to see if we can come to
a conclusion that works for everyone. aside, we
should talk about how we can do business. Obviously you have
access to illicit substances in quantity, and are having issues
with bad distributors. If you don't already sell here on Silk
Road, I'd like you to consider becoming a vendor."


"If you can get to meet up with us, or pay us
his debt then I'm sure I would be able to get people in our
group to give this online side of the business a try."


"FriendlyChemist" is a liability and I wouldn't mind if he was
executed . . . . I'm not sure how much you already know about the guy, but I have the following info and am waiting on getting his address." DPR provided a name for and
stated that he lived in White Rock, British Columbia, Canada,
with "Wife 3 kids." DPR added: "Let me know if it would be
helpful to have his full address."
**TL;DR:** Whatever evidence the blackmailer had, it was enough to encourage DPR to take severe action against him. And the blackmailer's incentive was that he owed a significant amount of money to the wrong sort of people, and would likely soon be harmed if he didn't square the debt somehow.

As [pointed out here]( the line would likely curve and hold around that figure, but would start to do so slightly out of the scope of this particular graph. You could imagine the lines shown as a small piece of a much larger smooth curve.
Also not sure why you received a downvote for this. You are technically correct, which is the best kind of correct.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:11:40
Wow that's pretty harsh - I wasn't criticizing. I was assuming he had the Bitcoin already by either mining or having bought some at some time in the past.
Of course it doesn't make sense to turn your fiat into BTC just to immediately buy a gift card with it and purchase goods that you could have just bought directly with fiat.
But if you've somehow already obtained Bitcoin, it's quite convenient to be able to buy an amazon gift card with them so you can instantly spend them on real goods at one of the the largest retailers on the planet. Much more convenient than dicking with the process of verifying a bank account and having your BTC deposited as USD, at a fee, and waiting upwards of two days before you can finally use it.
Not to mention, [BitcoinShop.US]( is a retailer on which you can buy many goods for BTC directly. It's already currency, by the very definition of currency. That you can buy amazon gift cards with it so you can then buy virtually anything with BTC you already had is just an added convenience. I agree that you shouldn't *have* to. But this time next year, Amazon could be accepting BTC directly. It's very likely.
@_date: 2013-08-14 13:59:52
That sounds quite right. Eventually those lines would curve to become more or less horizontal hovering around 14 days, but I think that curve would begin to happen somewhat out of the scope of the current graph.

By my calculations if I got it today, it would take just over a month to break even. That's not too bad. It's still $150/month in my pocket more than I had. And after that ~35 (lets say 50 to be really pessimistic) days, anything is pure profit.
I never intended to get rich with a Jalapeno. I just wanted something that cost less than a high-end graphics card, and mined more efficiently. I'm not only interested in the profit, I'm equally as interested in contributing to the blockchain and earning some crypto-currency to play with because I think it's cool as hell.
There's more to Bitcoin, and even Bitcoin mining, than profits. For some, it's a form of entertainment. I think actually getting paid any positive amount for entertainment is a pretty sweet deal.

Very nice response. Still trying to wrap my head around it, but this helps me get a lot closer to understanding it fully. The person I'm talking to is actually starting to get pissed with me over my defense of Bitcoin, because I keep trying to convince him that there's nothing nefarious going on, and he's not buying it.

Draw a vertical line from your approximate order date, then draw a horizontal line where it intersects the brown line to get a very rough estimate of how many days might be between your order date and the possible ship date, then add that many days to your order date and you'll have a very, very very rough estimate as to when to expect your Jalapeno, if the trend holds.
I don't expect anybody to rely on this, and just produced it out of my own anxiety of not having a clue when my Jalapeno may arrive. With this chart, at least I've managed to narrow it down from "Some time this year, hopefully." to "Early September, if this trend holds." (I ordered my Jalapeno on 02/06/2013)
**EDIT:** [Updated version with additional pessimistic line.](
**EDIT  [Lines Drawn for my Order Date as an Example](
**EDIT  As numerous disclaimers should imply, this thing is likely highly inaccurate (especially the farther you go), and I literally threw it together to give myself a better estimate than "this year." I'm not a mathematician or a statistician. I plotted the points with Google Spreadsheets and then drew interpolated lines over the spread in Photoshop. Not to mention I say many times "if this trend holds." Pointing out how this could be inaccurate isn't really news to anyone. If you guys are so good at this stuff, why haven't I seen anyone post a proper one?
**EDIT  This [Date Calculator]( is useful.
**EDIT  By request, [here is the Google Drive Spreadsheet]( that I based this on. The spread chart is on the second sheet (tabs at the bottom).
**EDIT # 6:** Added shaded lines to [represent 30 day increments.](
**EDIT  Added trivial curvature to [appease people.](
**EDIT  worked out the math and rendered a formula to project your approximate Ship date based on the values I graphed. That formula is: (ShipDate)=(OrderDate)*0.530389934+19620.19431;
**EDIT  (August 24th, 2013):** Updated [the graph]( to indicate the latest shipments. BFL appears to have picked up the pace significantly with shipping Jalapenos. It's very likely they'll ship my order placed February 6th on the next business day! :) (Note - I only added the new points, I did not modify the lines to reflect the new trend.)

That's the million dollar question. I could have bought some at $4.60 USD each when I first got into Bitcoin in mid 2011. I could have bought some at $19.00 USD each a couple of months ago when people were saying it was unwise to. And now I could buy them at $47.00 USD each, and every single time I've thought "No, they're too expensive, they're likely to go back down."
If you believe in Bitcoin, don't invest in them with the goal of having them increase in value so you can just resell them later. You'll perpetually think like I did - "Too expensive right now, I'll wait for them to go back down." Invest in them because they're a flat-out better type of currency.
