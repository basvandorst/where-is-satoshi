All data is compiled from CoinMarketCap and CryptoCompare APIs. 
Currently the app is only available for iOS at the moment, but Android is in the works!
This is the first iteration of the app, and I plan to add a bunch of features including price notifications and starring favorites. 
If you are feeling generous, tips are very much appreciated. 
All funds go directly to supporting me making more apps! Cheers ��

After bitcoin forks there will be two coins:
1. BTC = bitcoin
2. BCH = bitcoin cash
With the majority originally supporting BTC.

Correct. You must have an existing XBT balance before the fork to be credited with the same amount of BCH.

This is awesome. Would be great to use this to teach laymen about the history of blockchain.
Hopefully some trolls don't come and wreck it :\
Godspeed.

Keep that BTC in your Electrum wallet. Wait for the dust to settle. Eventually, you will be able to use that same private key for a trusted BCH wallet, then you can claim your BCH and still keep your BTC in your original Electrum wallet.
