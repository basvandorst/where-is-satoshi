It's purposefully hard because it's offline and geographically dispersed for best-practice security reasons. Would you rather they stored them online or all in the same little box sitting on someone's desk?


I used to work at Coinbase so I don't care if you "don't buy" the truth it's still the truth.

Eh, you have _some_ idea if it's valid (or at least if the network hash-power majority considers it valid.) Section 11 of the original white paper goes into the practicality of being deceived by this.

@_date: 2016-08-01 19:24:40


Ok, how? Most of their bitcoin is in cold storage with key fragments dispersed around the world. Do they risk the operational security to retrieve them daily/hourly and sign statements to the current cold storage balance? They can't link that to your specific balance and you really wouldn't have any proof they actually control the keys anyway. And what about their fiat reserves?
But let's be real for a moment. No one actually cares about Coinbase's proof of reserves. This is another in a long line of FUD meant to discredit Coinbase as much as possible because they oppose the current governance that has asserted itself over the protocol.

I don't think that's completely accurate. A lite client can choose to give some trust to a subset of fully validating nodes if the operator is concerned a network hash power majority may deceive them (intentionally or not) with headers for invalid blocks.

That doesn't speak for the broader market and community at all. That's consensus of something on the order of 5 guys. A hard-fork  at some future time or height with an initial hash-power minority which is supported by at least 1 major exchange would be a _real_ referendum on the matter.

Why are miners incentivized to improve scaling? They've shown they're more than comfortable with SPV mining and SW would also mean more data to send out with their blocks. Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-03-31 22:16:01
Doesn't this reduce to proving a transaction has a conjured parent in its chain somewhere within a fairly shallow confirmation depth? e.g. if the alert indicates the client needs to go through 100 blocks worth of transactions to find out why an immediate transaction (and all of its parents to that depth) is invalid doesn't that suggest either (1) a bogus alert or (2) the attacker was able to overpower the network for 100 blocks? In either case ignoring the alert seems like the correct and safe choice unless I'm missing something.

The Schnorr scheme is neat and a nice optimization but 30-50% improvement ultimately doesn't mean _that_ much. If you have the goal of global use of the blockchain then orders of magnitude increased throughput capacity is required. Do we really get there by chipping away at signature sizes?

Why would requiring a hashrate super majority be considered terrible activation criteria for a hardfork?
@_date: 2016-01-29 03:47:54
That security is only necessary for something supporting [cryptoanarchy]( and trust of nothing but that dishonest miners don't control more than 50% of the network hashrate. That's not the environment banks operate in (nor want to operate in.) I would assume banks would much prefer to allow themselves as well as even their business adversaries to control and agree on transactions vs. leaving it to probabilistic hash preimages calculated in rural China.

I disagree somewhat. I don't think it _really_ presents them with a choice. If they happen to know what's going on and closely follow the release train then sure, they have some sort of choice, although the options are not equally accessible. But if they aren't closely following the release train and change notes they may not even realize that by upgrading they're effectively voting to change the consensus rules.

@_date: 2016-01-17 21:01:00


A fork (hard or soft) is going to signal itself via a new version in the block header. Your software should alert you that it's seeing block versions it's not expecting well prior to any network super majority being reached for the new version. In Bitcoin Core/Qt the user is explicitly warned that their software is obsolete if 50 of the last 100 blocks contain an unsupported version. So for the case of any of the currently implemented block size limit hard-fork patches (that I'm aware of) you would be very clearly warned well before a transition to a fork and your given scenario would only exist if you completely ignored these warnings.
@_date: 2016-03-31 16:58:45
When I read the same words they appear sufficient in themselves of explaining the concept he _seems_ to have in mind. No introduction of a very specific yet unnamed and not obviously alluded to mechanism ("fraud proof") is needed. It would seem strange to need to make such a mental leap given how direct and concise he was about nearly every other detail of the system.


He wrote that the purpose is to verify an _inconsistency_ -- not to fully verify the block. A client can download the full block to determine it's invalid for reasons other than double-spending that it can't also determine from the header, e.g. perhaps the coinbase transaction outputs are inconsistent with the subsidy schedule and sum of the fees.
I assume the alerted transactions are transactions (and possibly Merkle nodes) required to verify the outputs meant for the SPV user have already been spent by another transaction elsewhere in the chain. This would cover double-spend violations.
This explanation does imply some amount of trust is required -- the user would be relying on at least one honest node to alert them. I don't know if that's an unrealistic assumption but combined with the already decent guarantees of PoW verification it seems robust enough for most things.

I would agree with that if I hadn't read nearly every comment in this debate for the past 6 months. It is very obvious there are a few people who are actually trolling _hard_.

@_date: 2016-01-04 19:55:52
I don't think it makes all that much sense right now. A single full-time Core developer has no real chance when they're up against a dozen that represent a single company and view. Look at Jeff's current position. He's a _single_ dev and he's seemingly being ignored. I've even heard his recent comments have been considered an attack by some. How fruitful is that? What's the point? How long is a developer going to want to stick around and deal with being railroaded on controversial discussions?
I think they understand the opposition quite well but even increased understanding hardly seems worth it to me. IMO, the major issue right now is that it isn't a level playing field. Don't get me wrong, these VC companies are somewhat to blame for the current circumstances to begin with but given history it's not so difficult to see why they've shied away from becoming involved with Core development.
I think there either needs to be a software fork or a new way of handling software development in Core where an industry-wide consortium manages software decisions. Perhaps each organization can have 2 developers with commit access and these same developers have a vote in controversial changes. It would somehow need to include independent developers as well. This is very hand-wavy but you can see what I'm getting at. I think the fairness or perceived lack thereof with the Core model needs to be addressed.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:28:32


I think this is playing a much larger role in the current acrimony than the current Core developers even realize.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:20:34
I'm both serious and vaguely aware of it. I have no strong opinion on it at the moment other than I like seeing people working toward diversity of options. The fact is Core currently has the market share by a wide margin. There are reasons other than political feelings about forks which currently explain why this is the case and that may continue to be true for some time. If it remains true it would be nice if the consensus voting mechanism in it was completely fair and open.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:04:11


I think it could be a simple parameter like "-vote-v5=true". I also think in the interest of a free and open election of a new consensus rule there would be no default. If a user omits the option they could be directed to a description of the fork. This would alleviate a tough and IMO unfair burden placed upon Core developers and force miners to consciously evaluate and vote on consensus rule changes. No one would be able to claim Core developers are somehow forcing/backdooring a consensus rule change into the software and onto the network.
**Edit**: To be clear, if a super-majority of mined blocks representing the desire for a particular fork gained consensus it would override this setting.

They have tried in the past. Pieter Wuille once asked me what I was even doing in  when I disagreed with him about the importance of mining nodes vs. economically dependent nodes. Even if I was wrong it's hardly an inclusive attitude. Most of my work was focused on internal infrastructure and Toshi but when I had some time (which I had very little of) I made a few Core code changes. I even wrote the first FSS-RBF patch, or rather patched Peter's full RBF patch. But in the end I decided to leave Coinbase and Bitcoin development.

Doesn't the destination exchange need to know what amount the customer received even if the other federation members are ignorant of it? How would that prevent them from front-running? AFAIK nothing does that today because it would need to be a regulatory requirement.


Well right, that's faster than Bitcoin but my point is the longer Bitcoin transactions take to confirm the more compelling this faster confirmation time is to the services and users. I can't see how that's deniable.

It isn't really about allowing free transactions because you're too cheap. The real purpose is to provide a means to confirm legitimate transactions in the face of spam attacks. Also if we move to a world where minimum fee is dynamic and you guess wrong it provides a means to still have your transaction get confirmed in a reasonable amount of time.

Eh, I think they hire experts but they only need so many given the nature of most of the businesses out there. What they primarily need are "full stack" web and mobile developers aka "coders" so your interview experience makes sense to me-- unless they mentioned they needed a Bitcoin protocol expert and were specifically hiring for that role.
With regards to pitching in, let's say Coinbase goes out and hires half a dozen or so systems engineers to work on Bitcoin Core full time. How warmly received will that be by the community? Maybe it wouldn't be that much of an issue now that there seems to be a larger concentration of existing developers all working for Blockstream in some capacity but prior to that (and even likely still) it's an interesting question.
Further, how warmly received will they _really_ be by the existing Core developers? What if the first thing they do is butt heads over the block size debate? Pitching in sounds great but I think the reality of the situation is slightly more nuanced.
I hear what you're saying though and mostly agree with you. More interested parties need to get involved with protocol development in some manner.

It's not that security isn't an issue it's just that the scope is different. Banks don't need to support a model where two anonymous entities trustlessly exchange 1 million USD value in ~1hr. In fact given anti-money laundering laws, in at least the US, they couldn't even if they wanted to.

I would prefer it if miners had a simpler option wrt voting on consensus rule changes. Right now they can upgrade or not. If they choose not then they have to either modify the software themselves or find an appropriate branch with hopefully all of the non-consensus rule change functionality backported. It would be nice if ~~soft-~~forks had a configuration toggle providing an ability to vote with selection of either option possible with equal difficulty.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:02:03


No. Satoshi's hard work and ingenuity is why Coinbase has a chance to exist. Bitcoin in fact was existing just fine before P2SH, CSV, libsecp256k, HD wallets, headers-first, etc. Sure, these new features are nice but don't get confused.
Most of these developers are now paid to work on this and they want to work on it. It's not like they're making big altruistic sacrifices on all of our behalf for which we owe them some debt of gratitude.

I don't think so. The miners ultimately will make the decision as to what chain they'll mine on top of. The market then has the decision to follow them or not.
@_date: 2016-11-18 02:47:38
Miners would have to make the first step at changing the consensus rule. They can't do it unilaterally. They can choose to create and honor larger blocks. Then it's on the market to also make it a consensus rule from their perspective, i.e. will they honor the larger blocks or not. If they do then it becomes a consensus rule. I don't see any inconsistency in what he's saying.
@_date: 2016-11-18 03:27:14
With this particular rule they would. Users could all preemptively support larger blocks but it doesn't mean much if there are no larger blocks being produced. There's also no provable way to show the majority of users would be willing to accept them anyway. Some subset of nodes could signal to indicate they will accept them but this doesn't mean much. We've seen such signaling faked in the past and we don't know how much of the market relies on any given node anyway.

His interests are pretty dang simple: **get as many people using bitcoin as humanly possible**. Only with a large number of users in the system _as a whole_ is Coinbase worth anything. How do you get a large number of users? Users need to see utility in bitcoin (better serves their needs compared to legacy systems largely due to decentralization so he doesn't want to kill that) and they need to have a very smooth user experience. This isn't rocket science or some machiavellian conspiracy.
What are Bitcoin's interests? I would think for real security in the face of nation states and other actors having a much much bigger set of users and a richer more diverse ecosystem is critical. It's hard to shut bitcoin down or co-opt it if **there are much much more users**. At some point the system will need to be maintained primarily by fees. What sounds more robust to you, 10s-100s of thousands of users paying large fees to use the system or 10s-100s of _millions_ of users paying smaller fees? Which sounds more useful? Which sounds more interesting? Which sounds more open? Which sounds more liberating? Which sounds more powerful? Which seems like it may have the ability to effect _real change_?
Self-appointed Bitcoin technocrats will tell you this is a pipe dream. We can't have our cake and eat it too (without hand-wavy external layers that have yet to be proven technically, economically, or legally resilient.) It may be a pipe dream, who knows (anyone who claims they know for certain is full of it), but it's the [pipe dream Satoshi Nakamoto inspired]( and to which the [system was specifically designed to realize one day](

That's a fair correction. Thanks. Was my response not reasonable?
@_date: 2016-02-09 21:48:03
That's certainly an interesting theory. Let me give you my theory and you can let me know if it seems any more or less likely:
- Increasing the block size will show that immediate growth is possible and the protocol isn't as locked-in as may be perceived by potential investors and users. Remember that in the current phase potential users are likely attracted to the prospects of more growth because the overwhelmingly most popular "usage" of Bitcoin right now is simply buying and holding it due to the protocol's deflationary monetary policy.
- Executing a successful hard-fork would possibly alleviate some of the stigma associated with a hard-fork and make it slightly easier to do in the future. I assume they will want larger than 2MB blocks in not too much time longer.
I don't think wanting to increase centralization nor adding blacklists makes as much sense. Gavin was also already an advisor to Coinbase and the chief maintainer of Bitcoin Core. It seems likely to me Brian preferred Gavin's leadership style over that project in comparison to what exists now and for the sake of stability would prefer it if he continued to lead an implementation. But that's my speculative opinion.

What evil motivation does Coinbase/Brian have for seeking a 2MB hard-fork?
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:02:08






When I look at section 8 the first paragraph describes how to check for a transaction's inclusion in the block chain using the linked list of block headers and the Merkle tree of the block containing the transaction.
The next paragraph starts with a discussion about how this can be faked if the attacker can overpower the network's hashrate and present you with a forked reality. Then to defend against being attacked by an attacker who has more hashpower than the rest of the network, the following is described:






That sounds like, "I've seen an invalid block so I'll warn you about it in case someone else relays it to you." It's far from an explicit mention of fraud proofs. The mechanics behind it appear somewhat open to interpretation. But to be clear, is this how you're inferring "fraud proofs" were an intended component to SN's described security model for SPV clients?

Note that this is not a Core release. The only commitment was that the attendees would personally have the HF code available at that time and propose it to Core. So I would take any timing of or even the promise of merging it into Core ever with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:54:13
I think the reasoning is historic and simple: Coinbase makes an effort to have the inputs to outgoing transactions spend from outputs associated with addresses only associated with your account. In earlier days certain systems (and some still do) made the horribly broken decision of assuming addresses associated with transaction inputs are under the control of the user making the transaction and thus are a reasonable refund/return address. So instead of dealing with every instance of that problem cropping up, they first route from their hot wallet to keys associated only with your account. It also somewhat simplifies bookkeeping. This is not at all new behavior and has nothing to do with the block size debate.
@_date: 2016-02-21 00:29:04
How can you promise a release including a HF as of a specific time? AFAIK only a very small subset of Core developers signed this...

This is FUD. As Brian and Gavin have been [saying for quite sometime]( the incentive is _really_ strong to have convergence on a single chain.

@_date: 2016-02-11 00:30:42

I'm aware part of it was used but the complete library wasn't. Only the SHA-2 implementation was directly copied. SN may have known Wei was the author of Crypto++ but he was apparently introduced to b-money by Adam Back suggesting he wasn't much of a cypherpunk or he was deliberately hiding the fact that he knew of b-money--- but then why make it the first citation of the white paper?
I've often thought SN was probably Wei but I have no proof. Whoever it was seemed to go out of their way to never directly affiliate themselves with cypherpunks nor libertarianism. If it was to mask their identity then citing b-money.txt would seem sort of silly. Whether or not he was either a cypherpunk or libertarian I got the impression SN was trying to attract a larger crowd but wasn't above leveraging smaller more impassioned groups to help bootstrap the system. He left the repository in Gavin's hands and Gavin has [refuted being a cypherpunk](

Satoshi never explicitly mentioned cypherpunks anywhere (AFAICT) and the quote you cite on the libertarian view point leads me to believe Satoshi didn't identify as libertarian but rather intended to exploit that belief system exactly as I said. Also, he allegedly was unaware of Wei which is pretty much impossible if he was a cypherpunk.
Whether or not he identified as either maybe doesn't matter. Given he never came out and explicitly did identify as such makes me suspect he wanted to see mainstream adoption of his creation and did not want to see it fall into the wastelands of fringe movements.

I think this is part of the problem. AFAICT, Bitcoin was never intended to be the sole possession of either movement but it's been a bit co-opted by both. Satoshi somewhat exploited both groups' beliefs in order to bootstrap the system and now members of these more fringe movements are preventing mainstream adoption. And again, AFAICT, mainstream adoption was always the intent.

Even though he was involved with the cypherpunks he seemed to be less interested in using cryptography as a defense against government intrusion but rather as a defense against a super-intelligence which might threaten humanity itself. He seems to be more of a humanist than a statist.
He's also long appreciated that Bitcoin's monetary policy could potentially be problematic. [He also didn't seem to consider a hard-fork to change that to be a grievous attack](
So I don't think his latest comments are completely inconsistent with his historical opinion.
@_date: 2016-02-22 00:17:09
So there's a big difference in saying building something is possible and claiming it as a matter-of-fact solution to all of Bitcoin's ails. There are serious non-trivial technical and UX issues and hell, psychological, economic, and legal issues, any of which may very well preclude adoption and realized success of LN. Whether it is a solution to any of Bitcoin's problems is very much an open question. It's an interesting idea and could possibly work but let's not oversell it before it exists.

Hash power can create a chain no one wants to follow which completely destroys the value of the chain they're mining but this would be irrational. It is a stated assumption that enough miners will act honestly for their own best monetary interests. If this assumption is flawed the system is fundamentally flawed and you need to design a new one. I believe the assumption is correct.

Not to be a jerk, but I don't see how they fit in as players in the bitcoin economy. Do they have users?

I mean he's a smooth talker but is there any proof of his CTO chops?
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:04:38
This isn't true. The original code was written by an experienced C++ programmer.

I don't know what Coinbase's current needs are but I'd be going after engineering leadership from somewhere like Google/AWS/NASDAQ and not an academic who ran an unproven start-up.

Leave those poor people alone.

_Real_ people aren't giving them crap. It's paid shills.

Eh, except that if he is a fraud and he knew this Kleiman guy wasn't SN why would he assume the real SN wouldn't come forward to easily discredit him? (while still maintaining his anonymity.) The current actions do make much more sense if CSW is convinced SN is dead.

Gavin begrudgingly flew to London to meet with him once to evaluate his claim. You can't spin that into "he's working with him."


So what? How is that at all relevant to anything? I thought bitcoin's creator didn't matter.

No one has ever tried to impersonate him before nor dupe/damage people he may actually care about.

Says the person who made the initial unsubstantiated assumption...
@_date: 2016-05-26 14:20:49


Working with him? Now who's spreading misinformation...

Please link me to any sections of code that you feel prove your point.
**Edit**: I haven't looked at 0.1.0 code in awhile but just pulling it up in emacs now and yeah it's still obvious. He's using multiple STL containers in highly idiomatic ways...almost no buffers... idiomatic use of templates, iostreams, string streams, using Boost. Correct use of critical sections. Very clean and succinct. This person has written a lot of C++ before. This may be a bit rushed and not the best style but this is no hack.
**Further edit:** It's not just the code but decisions made. e.g., he used the sha256 implementation from Crypto++ and not OpenSSL which was already a dependency. A novice programmer isn't going to even know to do that let alone be able to clearly articulate why.

What a crock of shit.

I would've "taken the initiative" but I wasn't invited.
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:56:38
It'd be nice if someone a bit less partial were asked to do this.
