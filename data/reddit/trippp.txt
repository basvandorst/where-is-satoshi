This has happened in Europe as well.

I've been trying to use your service, but I forgot my password, and after resetting it your site said the new password was wrong. I'm now locked out after 3 failed login attempts.

Receiving SMS payments is expensive. The operators charge somewhere around 25% in fees.

If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

It is taking off, in black and white markets. Have you had a look at Silk road or Bitmit recently?

I'm guessing this system will rely on a central authority and have massive fees.
@_date: 2012-04-17 19:17:07
Just what I was looking for. Thanks!

Why the passive aggressiveness? Criticism is not hate.
@_date: 2012-03-06 14:15:36
How do you know that?
@_date: 2012-09-28 20:46:09
It is? The one I get tomorrow?

Spendbitcoins terms are much better. 2.9% + 0.30USD fee.

What are the alternate uses for this kind of device? Besides mining for bitcoins, can it do something useful?
@_date: 2012-09-01 10:44:10
I'd say "The Big Bang Theory" would be the correct answer to that question.
@_date: 2012-03-08 00:51:51
This really shows the potential of bitcoins!
@_date: 2012-05-19 20:44:59
With Satoshis?
@_date: 2012-12-01 19:34:33
@_date: 2012-03-14 00:40:11
Also, there will still be mining.

I feel especially comfortable using a Russian service for this.

I don't think a day's worth of referrals will get him very much, since the referral amounts are like 10% of 0.0001 BTC. For the referrals to bring in anything substantial, the traffic would have to be MASSIVE.
That being said, I still think it's a neat idea. There are obviously a lot of people who likes to use those 0.0001 BTC per day sites, and this makes it easier. A general rule I try to apply is: "Just because it's not for you, it doesn't have to be bad".
@_date: 2012-09-28 20:47:23
Is that an actual quote?
@_date: 2012-06-27 21:13:08
Please tell me about those competing services with lower fees.
@_date: 2012-04-21 09:38:47
Nice work!

There are quite easy ways to expand your dropbox space. PM and I'll tell you more, since this is pretty off topic.

They will however make a tremendous impact on distributing hashrate all over the world, instead of putting it in the hands of a few.

I think it's a bit confusing what exchange rate I'm guessing against. Older exchange rates (especially the last) should also be shown with numbers in the graph, perhaps with a mouseover?

The majority of the people in the world is not living in the "developed" parts.

So, how do I go about aquiring webmoney for BTC or paying a store in Webmoney using BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-28 22:15:25
Good for you. Unfortunately, although I transfered BTC into bitcoin-24, I had sold it for EUR (at a crappy price) by the time of the account freeze. I now have a large amount of EUR in limbo, and I could've used them to buy cheap BTC.

I came here to say this, but you were first. Have an upvote!
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:42:18
Why the downvotes, people? This is true. Think about the legal systems in Nigeria, Afghanistan or Peru. How well do you think they work?
