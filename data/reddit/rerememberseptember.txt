Yes... and? 
BitPay is a regulated financial institution; just like a bank can't accept cash it reasonably suspects came from an illicit drug sale, BitPay can't accept bitcoins it reasonably suspects came from the darknet markets (though there are legitimate items sold on the darknet, BitPay has no way to separate bitcoins received for cocaine and bitcoins received for powdered sugar).

It's not at all like that. Bitcoins coming from a "blacklisted" wallet scream "HI! I WAS TRANSFERRED TO YOU FROM SILK ROAD'S MIXER!"

Currency can be "blacklisted". Banks won't accept deposits if they know the money came from an illegal source (at least some banks not named HSBC). That's just really *really* hard for a bank to prove unless the drug deal happened in the bank's lobby; usually, banks just have a suspicion, will accept the cash, may ask a "source of funds" question or two about the money, and file a report with the Department of Treasury about the transaction.

The patents themselves appear to be extremely broad, almost generic (though I don't have the necessary tech skills to be certain of that). 
I doubt most will get approved since these products have been used by other parties (including Bitcoin Core) for years. Somebody else in this thread mentioned that Coinbase may just have filed these patents on the expectation that that'll get denied on the basis of "already in the public domain", thereby protecting their services from future lawsuits. That defense is probably worth a half million bucks in VC money.

Are they? PayPal tried to do this, too, but was slapped down by the regulators over a decade ago.
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:38:05
Ah okay, thanks.
Still, PayPal also tried this but was told by the California regulator that it was not allowed (something having to do with the FDIC-insured funds being "off balance sheet" and not qualifiable towards a money transmitter's required liquidity reserves).

Wait, is this bitpay advocating an alt-coin?!?!?1!!1? Will our intrepid mods need to ban them now, too?

It was, along with other trades that were clearly linked to the first erroneous trade.

Mark wasn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer...

This isn't unusual on regulated exchanges. NYSE has the ability for people to reverse "clearly erroneous" trades.  Something similar happened to the Dow Jones in 2010. 
It might even be a requirement of Gemini's trust company charter.

A couple dozen errors, some of them debatable, some of them formatting errors or typos, only three considered "critical"... and all corrected in the text. 
Errors in scientific and technical publications happen *all the freaking time*. It is why peer-review exists. What you linked to was peer-review happening in an open way (usually, it happens behind closed doors).

I don't care one way or another about Cryptsy but....this article doesn't actually provide the "documents from various investigations" alleged to exist, the name or even the home office of the SEC agent the author talked to, etc. The snippets from the supposed documents contained in the article could be from anywhere. Why the hell would an SEC agent talk to some random Coinfire blogger?
The article also states that there are multiple "sealed subpoenas" from which Coinfire gleened this information (though that's a bit vague). Uh, disclosing a sealed subpoena is a *crime* (how do you think they stay sealed?); no federal official will risk their careers/freedom disclosing a sealed subpoena.
So Coinfire: release your primary source documents and your sources. Otherwise, I call **bullshit**.

This is aa totally ridiculous argument. Did an attorney actually tell you this?
@_date: 2015-10-02 03:26:15
Which sort of exposes how ridiculous the American regulatory landscape is. The twins are filthy rich and can afford to not be making money for two years. How many others can do this?

Screen captures of the actual disclosures factoid buyers agreed to? If so, then provide the imgur links to the screen captures. Until then, you're just blowing smoke.
I didn't buy any factoids. I, however, am interested in actual proof when accusations of "fraud" are being thrown around.

Interestingly, they're live in CA. CA's financial regulator announced after itBit claimed it could go nationwide with a NY banking trust charter: "uh, not in California!" I guess opinions have changed.
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:42:35
Well, I guess people could start stuffing mattresses with hard currency like it was 1930 again.
Or they could put their money into US bonds. Those *always* will be safe, right? (Let's ignore the Nov 3 debt ceiling deadline.)
Or maybe into investments like stocks, minerals and maybe even virtual currencies? Those are always stable...

In honesty, there has been rumblings of this -- at least in Europe - for months now. It's not beyond belief. The central banks are running out of weapons to jolt the economy. Easy low interest money isn't doing it; how about forcing savers to spend?

Do you have a link to their crowdsale disclosures which purchasers agreed to before forking over btc for ftc? You're claiming they misled purchasers but not providing any actual documentation that backs up your claim.

I thought itBit's international operations were independent of the US? (Regardless, financial laws are essentially integrated amongst the major financial centers to exclude "risky" countries from access to the financial aystem.)
Edit: unless they work with HSBC, of course...

If banks start going negative in the United States, the American Dream^TM is officially over. It's *already* close to impossible for anybody under 40 to buy a home and now you're going to punish them for trying to save to do so?

Eh, just a year ago it was owned by "Gemini Performance Solutions", an "eLearning and Training Solutions Partner" (whatever that means). Which doesn't sound very... valuable.
