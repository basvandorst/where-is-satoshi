It was a short lived fad in the same category as woke.

If OP was invested in Bitcoin there is no way this would be posted ever, anywhere, even anonymously.  This kind of talk erodes the value of Bitcoin.  Why would you purposefully want to eat away at your investment by broadcasting your doubts about it?  That is a perfect way to never be able to sell.  
Here's the thing, the Mt Gox collapse was the best thing that could have happened for the banking industry.  They want to crush Bitcoin.  They just needed an opportunity, and here it is.  Every single news outlet has some sort of article or segment about the imminent demise of Bitcoin.  This is a coordinated attack to reduce the confidence in Bitcoin.  And it's working.
Bitcoin does have its drawbacks.  It is still in its infancy, therefore people haven't quite figured out what to make of it.  We are shrouded in blanket statements designed to play on our inherent fears of the unknown like, "Anything on the Internet can be hacked."  Perhaps this is true on the surface, but I guarantee you that NORAD is doing just fine protecting their data.  Investing in the type of infrastructure that NORAD has would be a great start to making a show of attaining currency independence from the world's governments.  I don't, for one moment, believe Bitcoin to be the, "gold of the future," but I do believe it has promise in decentralizing control over money and, therefore, power any entity has over another.  Nudging the world toward being fairer is usually not a bad thing.

I open my wallet and give my time to this end. I give a lot more percentagewise than even Bloomberg. 
It's selfish people like yourself that drag humanity down. Sentient human life is the rarest of the rare in the Universe but because your mind can't conceive of 7 billions of them you throw your hands up in digust, lashing out at those with zero problems understanding their own place. You *are* the problem. Come be a solution. It's really not that hard to remove hatred and greed and jealousy from your life if you want to.

Technically the process of not letting you actually buy anything has already started-- go and try to buy any John Deere farm equipment. You'll see.

Not everyone's morals fly right out the door when there is even so much as a hint of money to be made. Did you not read this post?

Very generous. I feel that no matter who wins we all lose, but this curious offer may be able to slightly lessen the blow.

The poster makes reference to using a credit card, so it isn't that you can't spend more than $1000. It's just that you can only use an ATM to withdraw $1000 maximum while overseas. If you have $15000 you could still purchase $15000 worth of anything. You just can't do it in cash withdrawn from your travel destination.

I think you're getting down voted because you don't see this as an opportunity for bitcoin to shine over the present day gold standard (figurative) of fiat-- potentially presaging widespread adoption of a decentralized currency like bitcoin. That sounds like it has everything to do with bitcoin. It's industry news, so it is very much relevant.

Capitalism and Communism are not the on-off of politics. In fact, they are not even opposites as one is an economic model and one is a form of governance. Having studied both texts deriving such entities, I can say without a doubt that both are equally flawed in their methodologies. I am neither a Capitalist nor a Communist. I am a Humanist, which would never have me in a position to ally with Mao.
But but ahead and parrot mindless jabs at that which you do not understand. The dopamine hit is sure to give you that fleeting sense of satisfaction to numb your mind.

The system of economics is precisely what controls our resources. The world runs on Capitalism, to its detriment. Stating otherwise is simply expressing blind loyalty to that which you do not understand.
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:15:42
That's a feature of Capitalism, not technology. Capitalism is what leads to closed off gardens of human knowledge which prevents full scale collaboration.

From your point of view you call people not in your state of living "third world", implying their life is less valuable than your own. It's obvious that any "third worlder" is far more an asset to humanity than you are.

Take cash out of bank. Take cash to a Bitcoin ATM. Purchase Bitcoin with *your* money. Tell bank to fuck off.

Pretty sure you are confusing nationalism with patriotism. It's not wrong to be a person that loves your country, i.e. a patriot. It is wrong to insist that your nation can never be questioned and never be wrong, i.e. a nationalist.
It's not wise to adopt a position of false authority, kimo sabe.

Source on "Capitalism thrives and benefits the majority in democratic count[r]ies"? Last I checked 74% of residents in the States live paycheck to paycheck and an unexpected expense can ruin any one of those 250 million people, also known as the majority.

History is littered with laughing assholes that blindly laugh at all but the status quo only to find themselves headless when their industry changes. That doesn't even take into account the moral decrepitude of such people, or the fact that an algorithm can already do their job much better than they can. Their whole precious industry will leave them on the street faster than a foreclosed school teacher as soon as it's financially sound to do so.
I feel bad for people like this because history is never kind to them.

I wish you had turned your intellect to a more valuable pursuit than feeling all smug and superior based on hateful text. There's no legit science to prove superiority of any race. If anything is lunacy it's how you've deluded yourself into following madness.

That was quite possibly the most eloquent defense of racism I've ever seen.

Words have defined meanings. You don't get to personally choose their meaning for it invalidates your entire attempt at communication.

In the country that was founded upon the principles of freedom and a melting pot of all cultures nationalism is tyranny of the majority as you describe it, which is incorrect and misleading and still a decided net negative. 
Commas are your friend when addressing another person. May have learned that from the books I didn't read. Repeated lies do not the truth make.

In my mind, mass incarceration of nonviolent "criminals" is worse than much of what China has done. This is a several generations long cycle of life ruining, especially for minorities. Not sure if anyone has looked into the physical state of U.S. prisons lately...
