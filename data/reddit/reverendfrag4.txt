They make a whole lot more than that, actually.  Bosch group is raking in a cool fifty billion euros a year on a wide variety of products.
This blog is from Bosch Software Innovations, which appears to be some kind of in-house thinktank for integrating the Internet of Things into their product lines.  They're probably partly a marketing group that's trying to gauge/drum up public interest in having smartphone interfaces to your industrial control systems or whatever.  They're in partnership with a university, so they're probably also trying to see what engineering students can come up with that they might be able to snap up and patent.  A company Bosch's size probably has quite a few little internal workgroups like this one, just so they can react quickly to emerging changes in the market: when Dewalt rolls out a miter saw with wifi on it, Bosch HQ will be able to call down to B-SI and see what they've come up with along those lines.

No it isn't.  To have even the slightest chance of success in rescuing a couple hundred hostages held by an experienced multi-national guerrilla/terrorist force at an unknown location would require many millions of dollars of logistics, intelligence, and specially trained troops.
Your adolescent fantasy of a small group of mercenaries led by a private investigator infiltrating such an organization actually doing more than getting themselves (EDIT: and all the hostages) killed (or more likely sucking your funds dry from the comfort of a Nigerian hotel) are so far removed from reality that I have no idea how to bridge the gap.

@_date: 2015-04-28 05:59:59
If all the evidence used to convict Ross had come from these two guys, I'd be suspicious.  That's not remotely the case, though.  
These two particular agents are about as trustworthy as, say, an Internet drug dealer.  They tried to steal rather a lot of money and got caught.  However, the source of those bitcoins isn't up for debate: they were stealing them from Ross Ulbricht's illegal drug business, or receiving them in the course of investigating and failing to report them to their bosses as was proper.
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:12:25
Makes sense.  The Feds getting caught with their hands in the till has no bearing whatsoever on the mountains of evidence against Ross/DPR.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 04:52:33
...and now that he's been proven guilty, we know he was a criminal back then, too.  Of course, we knew that already based on the content and context of the interview in question.

The bottom line of a company like JP Morgan or Wells Fargo would barely even take a hit in the process of completely wrecking the bitcoin ecosystem by, say, having enough miners produced to execute a 51% attack.  
If they wanted to manipulate the price, they would be able to do so with total impunity.  The market cap of bitcoin is so laughably small in world finance terms that if "the banks" wanted to attack bitcoin, they could probably find enough loose cash between their sofa cushions to do so.  
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:12:37


Maybe, maybe not.  I don't know exactly what permissions they had on the server.  It would be unusual for moderators to have that kind of access, though.  
They didn't have access to Ross's laptop, however.  You know, the one he was logged into SR from at the time of his arrest.  The one with all the bitcoins he'd transferred from the SR accounts on it.  The one with the comprehensive diary of his criminal conspiracy.

Not at all.  Negligence would have been something like walking off from his laptop to go take a piss once or twice.  The _consistent and systematic_ failure to follow the basic opsec practices that (in many cases) he told other people to take was incompetence.  The overconfidence that led Ross to believe that by cobbling together a website with some off the shelf crypto components he could outwit the most powerful law enforcement agencies in the world was incompetence (and as good of a demonstration of the Dunning-Kruger effect in action as I've ever seen - [network security is _hard_](

Six years sounds about right for theft and extortion.  At least he didn't profit off of the sales of known poisons and (probably) try to have people murdered to protect his bottom line.
Dread Pirate Ross was a scumbag, y'all.  If you gave a damn about bitcoin's public perception, you'd be vilifying him.

Why should we release a convicted drug dealer just because the guy who ran the Magic the Gathering Online eXchange is still being prosecuted in another country?

"Musician" and "artist" are both a bit of a stretch, though I'll respect anyone who helped contribute to the downfall of the God Damned Beetles.

[Illegal in my state,]( so yes.


I consider it so, and have spoken to numerous people who agree.  (Especially when you consider the TOS that means you don't really "own" your phone and can't do what you please with it.)
