Vancouver is definitely extremely left-wing, as were the vast majority of the local Occupiers. One of the very few people who came up to me after my speech to say he appreciated what I'd said was a Ron Paul supporter. From what I understand, he did his best to participate in Occupy Vancouver for a week or two, but was eventually driven off.. apparently they were saying things during the breakout meetings like "you shouldn't be entitled to as much speaking time because you're a white male and white males have had a disproportionate ability to speak in the past". Didn't matter that he was a ginger. Things were completely out of control.
Mainstream media definitely seemed to paint Occupy NY as a left-wing / hippie / communist thing, as did Peter Schiff's infamous [Youtube appearances]( though I did talk to several people further down the road who spent some time at Zucotti Park and told me that it was a nearly 50/50 split between left and right.. which really surprised me. 
Problem was though, one side was focused on hostility towards big business and rich people, other side was focused on hostility towards government. Almost nobody (to my knowledge (except u/sgornick, who I became aware of after he posted in this thread)) ever seemed to come around to focusing on Decentralizing All The Things.
Anyhow, as the recent Occupy Hong Kong protests demonstrate, this is still a crazily amorphous, ongoing thing. Massive groups of vital, restive individuals are experimenting with [new Decentralized technologies]( and methods of organization and I still feel like the greater Decentralization movement is going to seriously inspire whatever the Occupy movement is at this point (or will be soon) and that the "critical mass" of which you speak will edge closer and closer…
@_date: 2014-10-17 10:28:24
Definitely a good point, and I definitely didn't mean to imply that Occupy was simply an "unreasonable rehash of all hostile uprisings of the past" that held homogenous ideals.
The main issue I had, and the reason I quickly determined that my 2011 efforts were futile and pulled back to redirect them elsewhere was the unrelenting hostility towards: Corporations, The State, Police, Rich People, Banks, Etc.
The majority of occupiers I encountered directly (in several different cities) were set on fighting the systems of the past, rather than building the systems of the future.. but of course, there were some very cool exceptions, like the [Freedom Tower]( dudes.

The solution would appear to lie in [Incentivized MESH Networks]( as proposed by "Right now, all Internet traffic flows through a few ISPs. They overcharge, they don’t really innovate, and they give preferential treatment to big business. For about 10 years, there has been the alternative idea of mesh networking, where we get rid of ISPs and, instead, have Internet messages relayed directly — person-to-person, laptop-to-phone-to-laptop. Theoretically, this completely solves the problems caused by ISPs. So, why hasn’t it succeeded?
The reason is that inside of one city, it works fine; but when you need to send a message, say, from Toronto to Sydney, that’s 15,000 kilometers, or 45,000 cell phone and laptop hops, even with optimal hardware. Even that assumes there are nodes going all along the ocean. It’s obviously far too slow and expensive. We need large, undersea cables and professional infrastructure for international routing. So, here’s the new solution: incentivized mesh networking. Anyone can join the network as a node. Anyone can charge for being a relay node for other people’s messages. And if I want to send a request to some server, I run a graph-search algorithm to find the shortest, cheapest path. So, if you pay a few microcents per kilobyte, your messages get transferred. If you have a phone, you can participate in the network and get a few cents an hour. Large companies can also participate. I could start a company whose sole purpose is to run and maintain a single wire going from Vancouver to Melbourne and collect fees off that. If my wire is the fastest, cheapest way to get messages over, people will use it. If I filter traffic from Wikileaks, then Wikileaks users can just use someone else’s wire instead.
The result is maximum modularity, minimum barrier to entry, an optimal marketplace. This allows you to incorporate satellites, undersea cables, intercity cables, phones, and more all into one network. That’s how we fix the Internet’s issues of monopoly and net neutrality."

This bodes well.
Radical Decentralization is something I've been pondering / researching / discussing / championing for many years now, but only recently (when crafting a recently-released ["Grand Decentralization Theory"]( did it dawn that Informational Transparency is THE factor directly governing the degree to which any system can be Decentralized.
Radical Decentralization (and Radical Freedom) is not possible without a system also becoming radically transparent (at both the institutional and individual level); hence the title ["Privacy Is The Enemy"](
But yeah, imho the fundamental ideal that Decentralization-minded individuals ought to be striving for is not Radical Decentralization in and of itself, but *The Liberation Of All Information AKA Radical Transparency*.
Of course, archaic intellectual property laws severely complicate *The Liberation Of All Information*, but a plan to address those is also detailed in the piece linked above :)

Also just read [THIS]( post and found some interesting / applicable info within: 
"Script can support even more complicated, multi-party transactions. For example, assurance contracts, in which people agree to fund a project conditional upon others contributing a specified sum, can be coded in Bitcoin. Alex Tabarrok’s variant, dominant assurance contracts, which pay back an extra penalty to contributors if the project doesn’t pass its threshold, can also be scripted. Bitcoin scripts can also consult an oracle, a trusted computer program that publishes information into the blockchain, Bitcoin’s distributed ledger. This enables information about the external world to be embeddable into Bitcoin transactions.

It is a shame. I remember in the early days the media were all clamoring for a "message" to emerge in NY and I was really hopeful that it would indeed be "Open-Source", knowing that Occupy had the potential to be a whole lot more than just another "eat the rich" rehash of all the hostile uprisings of the past. 
The one reasonable message that did seem to emerge was "get money out of politics", but unfortunately, hardly anyone involved realized that Bitcoin had the potential to do just that (although it is commendable that the main org were taking BTC donations, from almost the beginning, I believe, and I've heard than many within were big Open-Source believers).
Main thing to remember, I think, is that all the folks who were out there, fired up and seeking a new way forward are still out there and looking for answers, which is why I still share this video and have [continued]( to relentlessly promote Open Monetary Systems and the greater Decentralization movement.
