Electricity isn't *free* just because you're the one who's generating it. I mean, yeah, it'll be cheaper because you're just paying the cost of generation, but you do still have to pay for the coal/uranium/solar collectors/whatever. Also: There's opportunity cost and cost for the bitcoin mining equipment to consider. It's not that straightforward.

German public TV tends to be surprisingly pro-privacy in general. Not what one would cynically expect from taxpayer-funded if not *directly* state-controlled institution.

Using the highest number posted in [this thread]( of 500K active users, [these numbers]( that suggest there are 2.6 billion smartphone subscriptions globally, and assuming that every active Bitcoin user has a Bitcoin wallet on their smartphone... about 1 in 5200.

I don't think Kim Schmitz is ever not trolling.

You can organize political events, impact elections and still be a troll. Kim Schmitz serves a useful role in that he's a gadfly, and he sometimes actually has a point, but I'd still be careful about trusting his advice uncritically.

Yeah, these numbers are extremely speculative. I pretty much just used whatever figures I could find to estimate a ballpark. The approach you suggest would probably be more accurate. I'll see if I can get around to crunching some numbers in the future.

\ or rgb(200, 244, 16) as a ballpark value.
Wait, what was the topic again?

I dunno, that video is more than two hours long and I'm not watching it.
But he's always trolling at least a *little.* Sometimes he's 80% serious, sometimes he's 80% trolling. But it's always both.

The explanation at the bottom, sure. That one's straightforward enough. The flowchart above is very poorly designed, though. First, it makes you work to figure out where the start is - there's really no reason to start flowcharts (for Western audiences) anywhere other than the top left. The labels are placed awkwardly, so that it's not always obvious which label belongs to which arrow - which leaves you with a situation where you seemingly can only go to "Step 6" or "Step 7" after "Step 2". You first have to realise that the label probably applies to the arrow below, not the one above. Following the arrows from there leaves you back where you were before; to continue, you have to follow *a seemingly unlabelled arrow which first moves you back to the start,* because the "Step 3" label isn't anywhere near the origin of the arrow. And so on.
I really recommend [process flow diagrams with swimlanes]( for complex modelling tasks, and this is why.

If we're gonna live in a proper cyberpunk dystopia, we might as well bring back company scrip.

So that diagram is supposed to be terrible and confusing, right?
