Bullshit.  Anyone with a grad degree in econ would be right in line with "Big numbers are there to scare people, no context = no meaning"
Then to trot out Argentina.  What, did you just learn about Argentina today?  Do you think trotting out a singular whole number would tell the story of Argentina?  Because I certainly hope not.  Their story is complex, though not remotely unique.  It is not simply "GIANT NUMBER BAD, ARGENTINA DOOM"

\&gt; But scared or skeptical people never get ahead in life
You don't hear 'successful' people telling stories about how they got naively suckered into some MLM.  Being skeptical is vital to 'getting ahead.'  If you're not objectively evaluating things, especially with a proper context of human nature in order to tell when a bunch of smoke is being blown up your ass, you end up getting foreclosed on and blaming the banks because you took the word of some sales person instead of taking the time to do the math yourself when you \*knew\* you couldn't afford the loan.

You simply do not understand fractional reserve lending.  The money doesn't disappear.  The act of fractional lending is how money is introduced into the system for the very first time.  It does not go away after that.
Also your radical leap from deflation to *hyper*inflation is a bit excessive.  And you didn't explain how Bitcoin somehow resolves this given it is inherently deflationary.

This is a completely meaningless number.  If you derive any serious meaning from this, your understanding of economics is really bad and that's why you just made someone money  when you clicked on the link.

Man you guys are looking for fucking **anything** you can find that is remotely pro-bitcoin.  This guy is a huge piece of shit of a person.  So if your takeaway from this appointment is "Well, he's pro bitcoin" then I think we're almost there guys, I think we've almost hit bottom.

Interesting, I would love to start with any material that shows bitcoin is not inherently deflationary, if I get to choose my own adventure here.

I don't even know where to begin with how wrong that is.  
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:50:33
I am trying to understand how you are tying 'ex nihilio fractional reserve' (the concept of money out of thin air, which is arguable but I won't argue it) with 'loans repaid take money back out of the world.  When that is the opposite of what fractional reserve lending is (the introduction of money into the world).  You seem to seriously contend this yet are simply pointing me to google.

You know, for someone with an 'advanced degree in economics', you talk about econ incorrectly.
Recessions aren't defined or measured by stock markets.  Nor are they predicted that way either.
@_date: 2018-12-16 06:37:19
I don't.  It's as meaningless as the headlines "DOW PLUMMETS/JUMPS 600 POINTS."  Whole numbers are irrelevant very often as there is zero context to the number.

Sigh, this is the type of stupidity I cannot tolerate because of your unwillingness to acknowledge where the barriers are.
The 'real world', aka market makers, do not use the markets they make as a benchmark for anything.  They make markets as a result of the actual underlying economic data.  That is why they focus on items you refer to as 'artificial' 
But anyway, this doesn't need to go off into multiple tangential pathways.  If you want to be a simpleton and focus on the end, that's fine, but don't sit there and tout yourself as some highly advanced econ grad when you obviously apply nothing from what you learned to your analysis.  
@_date: 2018-12-16 09:50:58
Why is this so important though, I mean, considering all other things
@_date: 2018-12-27 06:12:58
I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to prove.  I stand by my statement, which is correct by the way, that recessions are not defined or measured by stock markets, nor are they predicted by them.  You seem to think that's not true, which is what I am calling out since you claim to also have an 'advanced degree in economics' and if that were true you would have had multiple professors say exactly what I am saying.
EDIT:  You know, the funny thing is that if you had an advanced degree in econ you could explain why your analysis is fundamentally wrong because the idea of a recession is coupled with the concept of economic growth and that the stock market doesn't actually reflect economic growth at all.  The rise in major indexes has been the result of historic highs in corporate buy-backs which have been ratcheting up the price of equities across the board.  This is not growth, but anyone that is uneducated looks at a stock market chart and thinks it is.  That's why it's dangerous to talk about topics like this in a way that displays fundamental ignorance.  You should own up to that man, that's all I'm really trying to say.

I didn't say bitcoin was an MLM, i was just using them as an example for describing actions of 'skeptical' people.  Who magically don't get ahead somehow, that's weird, i work with a lot of them - they are super important.

\&gt;  Debt that is serviced cancels dollars out thus removing them from the money supply.
If I owe you $20 and pay you $20 to satisfy that debt, you now have $20.  The $20 didn't disappear.
The worst part is you talking about deflation, though.  Bitcoin is inherently deflationary.  How in the fucking world do you think USD entering deflation is going to trigger growth in a separate deflationary system?
Actually, the worst part is the people that responded already agreeing while simultaneously saying the opposite.
