If you forget, then it could be due to brain damage (so they would be at fault).
Since you can't get your funds out if you forget, there is a huge incentive for you to remember.  You would have a lot more at risk than them.  The key here is that the secret phrase unlocks both escrows simultaneously.  There's no way for you to run off with the funds and leave them without theirs (and vice versa).

I have no bank account unfortunately.  I really don't want to open one up just for the sake of doing 1 transaction.  Localbitcoins just seemed like the easiest route.

Stop rubbing it in!  :P
But seriously, I am a bit sad that I couldn't grab it :(

Interesting (yet strange) question.  Assuming that I understood it correctly:
I suppose you could create a Bitcoin contract that would hold all of your money and some of theirs while you are frozen.  The contract would wait for a secret phrase before releasing 99% of funds to your address.  The other 1% of the funds would be given to the company.  To make sure that they wake you up at the time you request, you'd set the funds to be released to them only if you enter your secret phrase before a certain block is created.
To prevent them from just tossing your body, you could make them put some of their own money as an escrow to ensure they have some skin in the game themselves.  In the event that you actually die, your money goes poof, their money goes poof, and their profit goes poof.
The fee amounts are obviously configurable, but I think this is feasible.

Sadly, it was left open ended.

If this were the case, I'm surprised that they weren't caught earlier.
Especially when the US came down hard on them, I would imagine that the Japanese government would have taken closer notice.
You raise good points.  I wonder what will happen with them.

I'm in NY, not FL, so that's not an issue.  Who knows what the laws are here... I should have asked Supernintendo Lawsky when he did his AMA.  (That guy seriously is great - a nerd in the gov)
I'm not concerned with the markup, I found dealers who have &lt; 3% on occasion.
I can't deal with coinbase because I have no bank account.  I really don't want to have to set up a bank account just for a single purchase.
I understand that $5k is a lot for a lot of people, but I'm just worried that it's a lot of the gov.  I just wish that I had some cold hard evidence of what I am and am not allowed to do.
I was actually planning on donating the BTC (without any plans to have a tax writeoff to make it even easier).

Sadly :(
I just don't want to go to prison for something as silly as this.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:06:27
Well I mean assuming that the person on the other end isn't going to rob me.  If the other guy is a cop, for example, would I be in any type of legal trouble?

Yea that is like the financial equivalent of digging your own grave.  "We're going to charge you taxes, but not only that... we'll make you write up the bill yourself!"  I think it would be nice if the IRS at least had the decency to tell us how much we owe.  People fear paying the wrong amount more than they dislike paying it in the first place.  I'd be surprised if nobody tried to plead the 5th on their taxes.  If you can't compel the citizens to tell you what they owe, then it actually puts the burden on the government to ring up the bill (which would have the nice side effect of making them simplify the tax code).

The law is just crazy... since when was it up to the people to enforce the law?  Why is money laundering laws even a "thing"?
I have no problem with the police arresting people for committing a crime, but to require that all citizens now actively enforce an "embargo" on criminals just puts too much of an unnecessary burden on them.  Instead of shunning criminals from the economy, I wish the law just dealt with them directly.

Be sure to check your local laws first!
The rules vary from place to place.  Some places you may be allowed to do so without their knowledge, but others may need their permission.
That being said, I'm all for debating, but let's not kid ourselves - we'll be talking to a representative who doesn't know, nor care what bitcoin is and we won't get anywhere.
If you're still interested in the talking points they'd be hard pressed to refute:
* Bitcoin prevents identity theft (unlike your debit/credit cards!)
* Bitcoin allows us to make payments without a bank shutting us down (oh the irony!)
* Bitcoin gives us the ability to make payments cheap (much cheaper than your huge fees!)

Thanks for the clarification.  Interesting...
So I barely speak legalese and I certainly don't speak Japanese legalese, but the wording here seems a bit strange to me.
"Banking" means that they carry out acceptance of deposits or installment savings or exchange transactions.  MtGox doesn't do investment savings and I'm unclear what "deposits" are in this context.  The "exchange transaction" part almost certainly applies though if and only if Bitcoin counts here (Japan probably is unclear about if Bitcoin exchanges are actually a financial exchange).
I wonder if you're right about the deposits and if the "exchange transaction" part applies too.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:11:38
Gotcha.  So as long as I ask (and have proof that I did ask) if the money is obtained legally then I should be OK.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:15:38
Thanks! So if I'm under that 10k limit, I won't need to fill out a form. I just wasn't clear if I would need to register or not after the FinCEN guidelines came out. It almost sounded to me like both buyers and sellers would need to register - which would make it a horrible mess!
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:46:35
As far as I know, they are not a bank and have no Banking licence (nor need one).  I could be wrong, however.

Guys, there's nothing wrong with him making an offer much lower than market value.  It's equivalent to those orders you see on an bitcoinbuilder for 0.20 that haven't been filled.
There IS however an issue with you posting trade offers in this subreddit.  Via the sidebar:
"Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like "Buying 100 BTC" or "Selling my computer for bitcoins" do not belong here. is primarily for news and discussion."
Maybe try or ?
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:59:53
I can just imagine the responses here...
"Is it possible to buy Bitcoin with WoW gold?"
"Get some actual money"
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:35:43
Well I'm not concerned with price volatility.  I actually planned on donating the money to charity.  I've been through some hard times and I felt the need to give back.  What better way to give than by spreading the word about Bitcoin in the process!
So to answer your question, yes!  I am willing to lose 100% of it (but only losing it to this specific charity)!
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:23:12
Yea I saw that, which is why I'm so afraid to buy.  :(
The moment the other party mentions any illegal activity, I will of course leave.  It just bothers me that they were arrested for not having a money transmitting licence (I'm not even sure if they were charged with money laundering itself!).
It really is scary that there's no clear answer from the gov to such a simple question.  Typically you'd think that means it's legal due to grandfathering, but who knows.
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:09:47
... but what if I am?
I hate these unclear laws.
Edit: That article says they were charged because they were running an unlicensed business.  So where exactly is the line drawn between business and personal?  These are such "hand wavy" laws it's frightening.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:12:48
$300 is such a small amount!  Is that license required of the buyer or the seller?
