Thank you. Still having a difficult time conceptualizing.  Definitely need an "Idiot's Guide to the Lightning Network".
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:25:34
Can you help me understand this? As the buyer, I place BTC in the channel to prove that I’m “good for it.” As the merchant, I know you’ve got X amount of BTC, but do I (as merchant) have access to your (the customer) BTC before we close the channel and report all in-channel transactions to the blockchain?  
I was under the impression that the lighting network was more of an accounting system of off chain “side deals” but that no BTC actually changes hands until the channel is closed and a single (consolidated) transaction is added to the public ledger?
I’m fascinated by this, but fear that I am not getting it...  thx.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:53:10
Thank you for this. Your last paragraph is I think what I was really missing. 
I was having difficulty understanding how C’s bitcoin could be transferred to M such that M could immediately transfer or spend it as M sees fit prior to the channel closing. I figured that if the BTC is still sitting in an address controlled exclusively by C, then all M had was a promise (an enforceable one, but still just s promise) to settle up at some point in the future. 
What I guess I was missing was that the funds deposited into that payment channel are now in a separate address that isn’t under the exclusive control of either party. I don’t know why I didn’t see this, because I knew that a payment channel requires the deposit of funds to have any utility, but I think I’ve stuck on the issue of who owns the funds in the channel and how can the party who did NOT place the funds in the channel turn around and use/transfer/spend them until the channel is closed and the final accounting is recorded on chain. 
Really appreciate the thoughtful response.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:26:24
Thanks. I guess what I am struggling with is the mechanics of the actual transfer of possession of BTC from buyer to merchant if it is in the channel but not yet reflected on the blockchain. 
I thought this was more akin to two roommates keeping track of monthly expenses, and then at the end of the month they bring their respective accounts into balance with a single monetary transfer that reflects all the various expenses they shared throughout the month.  In this example, if we agreed to split all costs 50/50 but I paid for 75% of the expenses in a given month, I'd expect a check from you to cover the 25% of expenses that I fronted for you.  Until that extra 25% actually comes to me, I can't spend it.  I'm hearing that this is not what happens in a lighting channel and that the merchant actually can transfer/use/spend the BTC that is sent to them in the channel--but I struggle with understanding how the merchant can transfer/use/spend the buyer's BTC until it is formally transferred to the merchant by documenting the transaction on the blockchain.  
I find this so interesting, yet I'm so far behind in comprehending it....
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:25:56
Nice explanation. Has there been any discussion or speculation as to how often a merchant would close the payment channels for their customers?  
I mean, it’s obviously a decision each one would make, but I’m wondering if there is any sort of expectation of timing (like at the close of each day’s business, weekly, monthly, etc.). Would seem that the longer the channel is left open the better (certainly for the buyer) but if I’m a merchant I would probably want to access my funds sooner than later, and the sooner the payment channel is closed the more the purchase(s) documented in that off chain channel would cost me in fees. 
Just curious if you or anyone has seen any discussion on this issue.

I did not know that. I guess I still don't understand how "ownership" or possession of the buyer's BTC can transfer to the merchant if it hasn't yet been recorded on chain.  I'm clearly not up to speed on the technology here, and appreciate the education.

Same. How can it be that i am 100% certain that if I change my limit order to a market order the price will immediately go sub-$6k while simultaneously knowing that if I keep the limit orders in place I’ll never see them triggered?
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:52:46
That’s my hope as well. I think I will ultimately just cancel one limit order and use those funds to buy at the market while keeping the other one in place in case things go south.  I may never get that 2nd buy, but if that the case then hopefully it means what i do own is up a lot.  The hassle of calculating cost basis for tax purposes is what keeps me from just consistently dollar cost averaging my way in every month.  
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:10:35
I placed limit orders at $6k and $5500, and within hours the price moved over $6,500 and has just slowly gone up from there.  It’s irritating, and kind of crazy to worry about a price difference of this amount if believe the price will go as high as I think it eventually will. Yet here I sit, limit orders still in place.  I feel your pain.

Well, two of them own billions of dollars of bank stocks, so they literally have a vested interest in maintaining the current financial system and defending it against all threats.  I have no idea what motivates Gates, but the other two are just defending their own portfolios against what they obviously see as a major threat—which is why I think their public criticisms are actually good news. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:30:46
I’m probably talking myself into just pulling the trigger.  I’ve long felt that the longer term price for BTC is either WAY above any price we’ve seen so far or close to zero.  Either it survives and sees its value spike, or it doesn’t scale and isn’t the longer term store of value and the price totally collapses.  Neither outcome suggests that a few hundred dollars difference in purchase price will matter at all.  
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:29:23
Yep. In this space the “do as I say not as I do” cliche definitely does NOT apply.  It’s much more “actions speak louder than words”.

Perhaps I just hate my job more than most, but this concept is completely bizarre to me.  Without the need to work for money you have the time to do anything (or nothing) that makes you happy.  To be “lost” once the chase for financial security is over is to have an unimaginable lack of perspective and creativity.  
Learn a new language. Pick up a musical instrument.  Take a cooking class.  Read more. Improve your fitness. Reconnect with friends and family.  Be a mentor to a kid in need.  Volunteer some time at a local animal shelter.  Travel the world.  Fund a scholarship program.  Go to the movies.  Write a book/blog/article.  
I mean, if it’s that hard for you to find fulfillment without the pressure of needing money, you’ve already lost the game of life.

Eventually that may be what happens, but as I understand it the main issue is that institutional investors currently cannot participate in this market because of the custody issue.  Bakkt addresses that problem, which creates a massive amount of demand that just isn’t there today. 
Once institutional money comes in, they have to get their BTC from somewhere (retail investors, since that’s where all the BTC currently sits), and that’s where the impact on price will be seen.  Basically, they can’t start trading with each other until they accumulate holdings to trade—and that accumulation can’t happen until the custody issue is addressed.  
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:46:56
I think what he meant was that deriving any sort of comfort (or discomfort) about where your holdings rank isn’t really meaningful when looking at it globally if you live in an industrialized western country. If an American has a net worth of $50k that would probably put them among the wealthier people on the planet—but in every way that matters given where they live, they don’t have much at all, because while $50k may be enough to be rich in much of the world, in the U.S. it means you’re a single accident or even away from bankruptcy and homelessness.

Legal advice from the internet isn’t normally a great idea, but....
Not unless you anticipate having any personal liability that you would like to shield this money from. The LLC is a pass through entity for tax purposes, so you pay income taxes at the individual income tax rate for any funds you draw from the LLC. 
The main benefit of an LLC is that if you are sued for something the party suing you can’t go after the funds held by the LLC until you choose to distribute them to yourself (they can obtain a lien on any funds you may later distribute to yourself, but as the sole member of the LLC you control the timing and amount of any distribution). That gives you leverage to negotiate a settlement amount that is lower than what the plaintiff wants.  
TLDR: unless you need to shield those funds from creditors AND are prepared to not distribute them to yourself to utilize that shield, I don’t see any benefit to holding BTC or any other crypto in an LLC.

That argument just shows how far we have to go in the public education process.

But if everybody wants to sell at $40k (or, for that matter, at any particular price), virtually nobody will get that price.  A rush for the exits at a particular price is what causes an asset price to crash.  Same goes in the other direction.  If we all say we will jump in when the price hits $4k, almost nobody will get in at that level because the price will spike.

He also said he lost 60% of his wealth in this downturn, and then later said it was about $500k of losses. That means he was probably once worth about a million dollars and is now worth half that or less—and completely undiversified.  I dont think he is at all “ok”, and that just ignores that he remains entirely at the mercy of the worlds most volatile asset.  This is a fantastically stupid strategy.  
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:36:39
So he consolidated all his wealth in an extraordinarily volatile asset, has “no exit plan”, pulled his kids out of school, watched his wealth evaporate by 80%, and recently believed BTC would end the year at $15k when instead it dropped to about $4k?   Genius.  Does he not realize that exiting the workforce and going on an extended vacation with his family (a wonderful idea that more people should consider) did not require him to expose himself and his family to financial ruin by putting all his eggs in one basket?   I’m all for taking a chunk of your assets and putting it into crypto, but putting everything into anything is just Vegas style gambling.

Disagree. Politicians are tools.  By that I mean the system was set up to have the public will expressed by elected officials rather than through a direct democracy (e.g. referendum).  
We put them there.  Now, they game the system through gerrymandering and otherwise to stay in power, but the fault for having had people in office lies squarely with the people.  
Change needn’t happen only by revolution.  Change happens when people hold their employees accountable for doing the people’s business. That’s what makes the Parkland movement so important. These kids are sayin they’ve had enough of a bunch of pussy legislators kowtowing to the NRA. If they have the discipline and perseverance to keep at it, they can make change.  
Women’s rights, civil rights, and gay rights all happened because the people rose up and demanded it. Politicians are not leaders, they are followers.   When the loudest voices in their ears are corporate lobbyists, they rationally push corporate interests.  If we want them to be better, we need to hold them accountable, but a country that elects Donald Trump and Republican majorities to the house and senate is not a country that wants or deserves change.  
When the voters get serious, the politicians follow suit.  The problem is that the voters suck.

I’d like an answer to his question. I’m a holder and supporter of BTC, but i don’t see how it replaces debt. There is nothing standing in the way of people or institutions issuing debt in the form of BTC at some point, so i don’t understand the argument.

Totally agree about Citizens United, but the blame still lies with the people. Seriously, blue collar worker just elected a billionaire who inherited his wealth and whose antipathy towards the working class is obvious to anyone who looks.  The facts are readily available for any voter to see, but most would rather drink beer, watch sports and be told how great everything is.  I strongly believe that we get the government we deserve.   Some of us obviously get screwed in the process, but that’s the price we pay for living in a country populated by dumbasses who think an elitist billionaire CEO is going to bring back coal mining jobs and solve our ills through trade wars with China.  
There is no cure for stupid, and no system can overcome an uninformed electorate.

I think that’s obviously an oversimplification.  One party places corporate profits ahead of worker safety, environmental protection, and a better social safety net. You know this is true. Of course the Democratic Party caters to the elite to some degree. This is a necessary part of politics in a “campaign contributions = speech” world.  However, it’s a mistake to equate the two parties.  If you misdiagnose the problem you can’t fix it.

Every trade of every asset class is about market timing. If you trade the stocks in Buffet’s portfolio you had better time the market correctly, and the same holds true for trading BTC or anything else. 
However, if you are investing in an asset, market timing is far less relevant. If you’re buying Bitcoin today for a long term hold, its current price is really immaterial.  Nobody is going to care if they paid $7,000 or $6,500 for an asset that ends up at $25,000 or $50,000 or higher, and if it fails and goes to near zero, your entry price is similarly irrelevant.  
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:53:24
I think you misread my comment. I am not advocating for a market timing strategy.  I am merely saying that if you are a TRADER then it is imperative that you time the market correctly—because it is impossible to be a successful trader if you are entering and exiting positions quickly but at the wrong time.  
By contrast, if you are a long term INVESTOR (like Buffett and, to a vastly less successful level, like me), short term price movements are irrelevant. For long term investors, you have to get the STORY right, not the price—because of you get the long term story right, your gains will be substantial enough to make your specific entry point rather unimportant. 
This isn’t a controversial or even debatable take.  I just may have not been as clear in the original comment.
