'Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin'
That's all I needed to know

Small error in title, but oh well
From a recent Bitcointalk thread for trading Mtgox BTC for 'real' BTC

This has been posted like a dozen times before, and I'm talking a week or so ago
As someone who lives in NSW, Australia I would like to first point out that this app is NOT OFFICIALLY ENDORSED, and is used by far less than the 'over 50,000 people' as claimed (the total amount of installs ever on Google play is listed as '10,000-50,000' and is it likely that EVERY install means a new, ongoing user?).
But here's the biggest bit: You can't actually 'pay for the bus' in Bitcoin! You must pay in dollars, via a top-up card, which can be topped up by credit card, bank direct debit, over the phone, etc. - this means you can't actually pay either immediately nor with your own Bitcoins, but you have to buy money from the developers beforehand (who privately onsell the Bitcoins you give them for cash) AND at an exorbitant commission.
The same could be done with gold, silver, peanuts, bottle tops, Runescape gold, etc. - its just converting them for dollars by selling them to the developers, and then using those prepaid dollars later on for the bus. A lot of hassle for garbage that is being hyped deliberately as some revolutionary thing, as though ACT transport is now accepting Bitcoin (they've flat out rejected and refused the whole app together, you can see this via the videos linked on the app's very own website)

LOL this is how dumb the Bitcoin community has become
Listen kid, with that hardware you're going to be making $0.20 per month, and that's not counting electricity costs and the cost of replacing your baked hardware (no, a 'small fan' won't help - I suggest you take out a fire insurance policy).
There's also no such thing as 'free electricity', so who are you leeching it off? Mom? Your school?
Even with altcoins you'll be making peanuts - ~$20 a month at best, again not including electricity or hardware costs and the prospect of a bubble burst in the price of Bitcoin/altcoins
