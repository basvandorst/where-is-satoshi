I believe the first site with direct bitcoin to stock ownership will be the site to claim king. 
Direct access to the regular financial market would not only mesh bitcoin into the existing system, it would allow them to transfer more easily. This is the way bitcoin should/must move forward, and the investor who does it will be rich

Russia doesn't want a global currency. Much more content to be a nationalists in that country right now

Was looking more a ~current user of the site, but thank you

I had an idea for something extremely similar to this a few years ago with no programming knowledge to do it. If this gets off the ground it will change humanity due to the untapped computing power. We'd be able to figure out how diseases work, create new materials, and solve so many other problems
I'm super glad someone is actually pursuing this, bitcoin is established already; I can see it working. Only problem is if it's hardware level you could create botnets far far easier. I wish these 21 guys luck, tough problems they are tackling
Edit:hope nobody reads this and thinks i'm saying i could of brought this to fruition or think they stole my idea or anything. Just a similar concept occured to me, they actually got all the details sorted out

ok, just seemed really high when i converted it into farenheight and i panicked. But my card is at 99% usage, is that bad? or same thing applies?

i have a radeon 6750 ati card. The overdrive application in the catalyst control center only goes up to 60C, so i have no idea what the actual temp is on the card

I am using the standard catalyst control center overclocker. how do i know if i'm running into power limitations?

What are the best overclock settings for my card using ccc? the gpu clock is at 790 mhz, and the memory clock is at 862 mhz. I want to find the sweet spot, because if i go too high, it has the opposite effect and the system slows down

Either or. Would really like a iphone based wallet, not a virtual app portal. Ill just transfer my shit there, but a local JB wallet would be better

How about a local bitcoin wallet for the iphone. None of this web wallet shit thats easily hackable
