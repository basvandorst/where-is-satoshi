Why bankers should panic? I dont understand all this stuff about crypto hype. Yes, blockchain has advantages. But crypto? Lets pretend theres no volatile. All people start using crypto. Where you going when you want to buy a house or a car? To the bank, dude. So why should bankers panic?

I'm not talking about speculation. I'm talking about mass adoption. Suppose, in 5 years everyone uses bitcoins. Your salary is 20 bitcoins per annum. For example, house costs 300 bitcoins. How will people buy houses without loans? I see a lot of enthusiastic reviews and predictions about bitcoin, but no one can answer this simple question.

If you do not have enough bitcoins to buy a house, you will go to the bank for a loan, I suppose?
