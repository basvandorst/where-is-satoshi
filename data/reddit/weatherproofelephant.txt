You all realize deflation is bad, right? If something is always going up in value you never want to use/spend it and the economy stops.

Got it!  Hard to know the difference between  100% koolaid and sarcasm here sometimes.

I didn’t mess up.  The reality is the reason there is inflation is because there is an increase in the money supply.  That isn’t a problem as long as the inflation rate is below that of the rate of the increase in money supply.  That’s how standards of living increase.  If there are 1000 people with $10,000 and a widget costs $1 and then tomorrow there are 1500 people with $20,000 and the same widget costs $1.50 then on average everyone’s standard of living increased even though there was inflation.  That’s how things work in a healthy economy and why everyone has a better standard of living today vs 100 years ago despite things costing nominally 100 times more.  Bitcoin does nothing to facilitate this.

How could the poorest person afford to pay all these people?

So if there are 1000 people and they each have $10 and there’s only ever a total of $10,000 what happens when the population increases to 1500 people?  Now there’s 1500 people, the same $10,000, and the 1000 are doing their very best to keep control of the $10,000 while the 500 have nothing.

You don't know what risk means apparently.

Why would someone hire more workers to give away their finite supply of money? How would the new people acquire raw materials to produce something without money?

Yes if you’re selling it for real money on eBay or whatever you absolutely will pay taxes on it.  If you are just raiding and collecting gold in game it’s not taxable.

Your reading comprehension is awful. I’m talking about WoW money. 
The IRS has already stated that Bitcoin is property and subject to the appropriate taxes.  If you mine it it’s taxable. If you buy it and it increases in value and then sell it it is taxable. If you mine it, pay taxes on creation date, then sell it for a profit you owe both income and capital gains taxes. If you sell it for a loss you can take a capital loss.

Just like gold in 1933?  Everyone left, right?

We’re not talking about crypto currencies which are trying to be real currencies.  We’re talking about trading World of Warcraft gold for Ultimate Online gold.  These are no currencies, these are pretend video game things that would not meet any definition of property as currently written by the IRS:
IRS defines a virtual currencies “Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value... Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as “convertible” virtual currency.”  WoW gold would not pass this standard.

Sure if you are both well known artists and the art is worth something. But I’m talking about things that are garbage/valueless. If you kids draw each other pictures and give them to each other that’s not a taxable event. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:54:01
WoW gold would not meet the standard of a virtual currency based on the IRS’s current guidance.

It’s all worthless unless you convert it to real money.  Go back to my scrap metal example. You’ve turned the scrap metal into a sculpture. You then trade your sculpture for a painting your friend did.  This isn’t a taxable event.

They can end the game by making Bitcoin illegal with harsh penalties if you are discovered having it.

Sorry, I shouldn’t have used the word hobby.  I don’t mean hobby as in you don’t pay income on hobby income, you do, I meant hobby as in something you do for fun/no income earning.
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:14:22
You’re right...I should have said all that needs to happen to end the game for you is for your country to ban it.
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:10:18
Okay how about this.  You don’t own anything in WoW.  It is a service.  Blizzard owns everything and it can unilaterally take it from you.  It’s very similar to credit card points.  They’re nominally yours until American Express decides they don’t want you as a card member anymore and your bank of points are gone.

If you sell your Warcraft gold on the eBay for real money then it is taxable and you should file a Schedule C.  You’re conducting a business. 
If you’re just reading in game and earning in game money it is nothing. 
Compare it to someone who collects scrap metal on the side. 
If you just like to collect scrap metal to make metal sculptures for your backyard then it is a hobby.  If you take that same scrap metal and sell it for cash it’s a business and the income is taxable.
